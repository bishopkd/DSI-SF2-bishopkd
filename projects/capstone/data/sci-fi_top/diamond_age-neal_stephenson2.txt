You never knew when they'd all gotten too worn out to work anymore, which is how Tequila had ended up with Nell.One of the women said you could buy a special kind of Freedom Machine that would go in there and eat a fetus.Nell didn't know what a fetus was, but all of the women apparently did, and thought that the idea was the kind of thing that only the Chinese or Hindustanis would ever think up.Tequila said she knew all about that sort of Freedom Machine but didn't want to use one, because she was afraid it might be gross.Sometimes Tequila would bring back pieces of real cloth from her work, because she said that the rich Victorians she worked for would never miss them.She never let Nell play with them, and so Nell did not understand the difference between real cloth and the kind that came from the M. C.   Harv found a piece of it once.The Leased Territories, where they lived, had their own beach, and Harv and his friends liked to go prospecting there, early in the morning, for things that had drifted across from Shanghai, or that the Vickys in New Atlantis Clave had flushed down their water closets.What they were really looking for was pieces of stretchy, slippery Nanobar.Sometimes the Nanobar was in the shape of condoms, sometimes it came in larger chunks that were used to wrap things up and preserve them from the depredations of mites.In any case, it could be gathered up and sold to certain persons who knew how to clean it and weld one piece of Nanobar to another and make it into protective suits and other shapes.Harv had quietly stuffed the piece of cloth into his shoe and then limped home, not saying a word to anyone.That night Nell, lying on her red mattress, was troubled by vague dreams about strange lights and finally woke up to see a blue monster in her room: It was Harv underneath his blanket with a torch, doing something.She climbed out very slowly so as not to disturb Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple, and stuck her head beneath the blanket, and found Harv, holding the little flashlight in his teeth, working at something with a pair of toothpicks."Harv," she said, "are you working on a mite?""No, dummy. "Harv's voice was hushed, and he had to mumble around the little button shaped torch he was holding in his teeth."Mites are lots smaller.See, look!"She crawled forward a little more, drawn as much by warmth and security as by curiosity, and saw a limp mottled brown thing a few centimeters on a side, fuzzy around the edges, resting on Hanv's crossed ankles."What is it?""It's magic.Watch this," Harv said.And worrying at it with his toothpick, he teased something loose."It's got string coming out of it!"Nell said."Sssh!"Harv gripped the end of the thread beneath his thumbnail and pulled.It looked quite short, but it lengthened as he pulled, and the fuzzy edge of the piece of fabric waffled too fast to see, and then the thread had come loose entirely.He held it up for inspection, then let it drift down onto a heap of others just like it."How many does it have?"Nell said."Nell," Harv said, turning to face her so that his light shone into her face, his voice coming out of the light epiphanically, "you got it wrong.It's not that the thing has threads in it it is threads.Threads going under and over each other.If you pulled out all of the threads, nothing would be left. ""Did mites make it?"Nell asked."The way it's made so digital each thread going over and under other threads, and those ones going over and under all the other threads " Harv stopped for a moment, his mind overloaded by the inhuman audacity of the thing, the promiscuous reference frames."It had to be mites, Nell, nothing else could do it. "Security measures adopted by Atlantis/Shanghai.Atlantis/Shanghai occupied the loftiest ninety percent of New Chusan's land area an inner plateau about a mile above sea level, where the air was cooler and cleaner.Parts of it were marked off with a lovely wrought iron fence, but the real border was defended by something called the dog pod grid a swarm of quasi independent aerostats.Aerostat meant anything that hung in the air.This was an easy trick to pull off nowadays.Nanotech materials were stronger.Computers were infinitesimal.Power supplies were much more potent.It was almost difficult not to build things that were lighter than air.Really simple things like packaging materials the constituents of litter, basically tended to float around as if they weighed nothing, and aircraft pilots, cruising along ten kilometers above sea level, had become accustomed to the sight of empty, discarded grocery bags zooming past their windshields (and getting sucked into their engines).As seen from low earth orbit, the upper atmosphere now looked dandruffy.Protocol insisted that everything be made heavier than need be, so that it would fall, and capable of being degraded by ultraviolet light.But some people violated Protocol.Given that it was so easy to make things that would float in air, it was not much of a stretch to add an air turbine.This was nothing more than a small propeller, or series of them, mounted in a tubular foramen wrought through the body of the aerostat, drawing in air at one end and forcing it out the other to generate thrust.A device built with several thrusters pointed along different axes could remain in one position, or indeed navigate through space.Each aerostat in the dog pod grid was a mirror surfaced, aerodynamic teardrop just wide enough, at its widest part, to have contained a pingpong ball.These pods were programmed to hang in space in a hexagonal grid pattern, about ten centimeters apart near the ground (close enough to stop a dog but not a cat, hence "dog pods") and spaced wider as they got higher.In this fashion a hemispherical dome was limned around the sacrosanct airspace of the New Atlantis Clave.When wind gusted, the pods all swung into it like weathervanes, and the grid deformed for a bit as the pods were shoved around; but all of them eventually worked their way back into place, swimming upstream like minnows, propelling the air turbines.The 'bines made a thin hissing noise, like a razor blade cutting air, that, when multiplied by the number of pods within earshot, engendered a not altogether cheerful ambience.Enough wrestling with the wind, and a pod's battery would run down.Then it would swim over and nuzzle its neighbor.The two would mate in midair, like dragonflies, and the weaker would take power from the stronger.The system included larger aerostats called nurse drones that would cruise around dumping large amounts of power into randomly selected pods all over the grid, which would then distribute it to their neighbors.If a pod thought it was having mechanical trouble, it would send out a message, and a fresh pod would fly out from the Royal Security installation beneath Source Victoria and relieve it so that it could fly home to be decompiled.As numerous eight year old boys had discovered, you could not climb the dog pod grid because the pods didn't have enough thrust to support your weight; your foot would just mash the first pod into the ground.It would try to work its way loose, but if it were stuck in mud or its turbines fouled, another pod would have to come out and replace it.For the same reason you could pluck any pod from its place and carry it away.When Hackworth had performed this stunt as a youth, he had discovered that the farther it got from its appointed place the hotter it became, all the while politely informing him, in clipped military diction, that he had best release it or fall victim to vaguely adumbrated consequences.But nowadays you could just steal one or two whenever you felt like it, and a new one would come out and replace it; once they figured out they were no longer part of the grid, the pods would self scramble and become instant souvenirs.This user friendly approach did not imply that grid tampering went ignored, or that such activities were approved of.You could walk through the grid whenever you chose by shoving a few pods out of the way unless Royal Security had told the pods to electrocute you or blast you into chum.If so, they would politely warn you before doing it.Even when they were in a more passive mode, though, the aerostats were watching and listening, so that nothing got through the dog pod grid without becoming an instant media celebrity with hundreds of uniformed fans down in Royal Joint Forces Command.Unless it was microscopic.Microscopic invaders were more of the threat nowadays.Just to name one example, there was Red Death, a. k. a.  the Seven Minute Special, a tiny aerodynamic capsule that burst open after impact and released a thousand or so corpuscle size bodies, known colloquially as cookie cutters, into the victim's bloodstream.It took about seven minutes for all of the blood in a typical person's body to recirculate, so after this interval the cookie cutters would be randomly distributed throughout the victim's organs and limbs.A cookie cutter was shaped like an aspirin tablet except that the top and bottom were domed more to withstand ambient pressure; for like most other nanotechnological devices a cookie cutter was filled with vacuum.Inside were two centrifuges, rotating on the same axis but in opposite directions, preventing the unit from acting like a gyroscope.The device could be triggered in various ways; the most primitive were simple seven minute time bombs.Detonation dissolved the bonds holding the centrifuges together so that each of a thousand or so balhisticules suddenly flew outward.The enclosing shell shattered easily, and each ballisticule kicked up a shock wave, doing surprisingly little damage at first, tracing narrow linear disturbances and occasionally taking a chip out of a bone.But soon they slowed to near the speed of sound, where shock wave piled on top of shock wave to produce a sonic boom.Then all the damage happened at once.Depending on the initial speed of the centrifuge, this could happen at varying distances from the detonation point; most everything inside the radius was undamaged but everything near it was pulped; hence, "cookie cutter. "The victim then made a loud noise like the crack of a whip, as a few fragments exited his or her flesh and dropped through the sound barrier in air.Startled witnesses would turn just in time to see the victim flushing bright pink.Bloodred crescents would suddenly appear all over the body; these marked the geometric intersection of detonation surfaces with skin and were a boon to forensic types, who could thereby identify the type of cookie cutter by comparing the marks against a handy pocket reference card.The victim was just a big leaky sack of undifferentiated gore at this point and, of course, never survived.Such inventions had spawned concern that people from Phyle A might surreptitiously introduce a few million lethal devices into the bodies of members of Phyle B, providing the technically sweetest possible twist on the trite, ancient dream of being able instantly to turn a whole society into gravy.A few inroads of that kind had been made, a few mass closed casket funerals had been held, but not many.It was hard to control these devices.If a person ate or drank one, it might end up in their body, but it might just go into the food chain and get recycled into the body of someone you liked.But the big problem was the host's immune system, which caused enough of a histological fuss to tip off the intended victims.What worked in the body could work elsewhere, which is why phyles had their own immune systems now.The impregnable shield paradigm didn't work at the nano level; one needed to hack the mean free path.A well defended clave was surrounded by an aerial buffer zone infested with immunocules microscopic aerostats designed to seek and destroy invaders.In the case of Atlantis/Shanghai this zone was never shallower than twenty kilometers.The innermost ring was a greenbelt lying on both sides of the dog pod grid, and the outer ring was called the Leased Territories.It was always foggy in the Leased Territories, because all of the immunocules in the air sensed as nuclei for the condensation of water vapor.If you stared carefully into the fog and focused on a point inches in front of your nose, you could see it sparkling, like so many microscopic searchlights, as the immunocules swept space with lidar beams.Lidar was like radar except that it used the smaller wavelengths that happened to be visible to the human eye.The sparkling of tiny lights was the evidence of microscopic dreadnoughts hunting each other implacably through the fog, like U boats and destroyers in the black water of the North Atlantic.Nell sees something peculiar;  Harv explains all.One morning Nell looked out the window and saw the world had turned the color of pencil lead.Cars, velocipedes, quadrupeds, even power skaters left towering black vortices in their wakes.Harv came back from being out all night.Nell screamed when she saw him because he was a charcoal wraith with two monstrous growths on his face.He peeled back a filter mask to reveal grayish pink skin underneath.He showed her his white teeth and then took up coughing.He went about this methodically, conjuring tangles of spun phlegm from his deepest alveoli and projecting them into the toilet.Now and then he would stop just to breathe, and a faint whistling noise would come from his throat.Harv did not explain himself but went about working with his things.He unscrewed the bulges on his mask and took out black things that kicked up little black dust storms when he tossed them onto the floor.He replaced them with a couple of white things that he took from a Nanobar wrapper, though by the time he was finished, the white things were covered with his black fingerprints, the ridges and whorls perfectly resolved.He held the Nanobar wrapper up to the light for a moment."Early protocol," he rasped, and pitched it toward the wastebasket.Then he held the mask up to Nell's face, guided the straps around her head, and tightened them down.Her long hair got caught in the buckles and pinched, but her objections were muffled by the mask.It took a little effort to breathe now.The mask pressed against her face when she inhaled and whooshed when she exhaled."Keep it on," Harv said."It'll protect you from toner. ""What's toner?"she mumbled.The words did not make it out through the mask, but Harv guessed them from the look in her eyes."Mites," he said, "or so they say down at the Flea Circus anyway. "He picked up one of the black things taken from the mask and flicked it with a fingertip.A cineritious cloud swirled out of it, like a drop of ink in a glass of water, and hung swirling in the air, neither rising nor falling.Sparkles of light flashed in the midst of it like fairy dust."See, there's mites around, all the time.They use the sparkles to talk to each other," Harv explained."They're in the air, in food and water, everywhere.And there's rules that these mites are supposed to follow, and those rules are called protocols.And there's a protocol from way back that says they're supposed to be good for your lungs.They're supposed to break down into safe pieces if you breathe one inside of you. "Harv paused at this point, theatrically, to summon forth one more ebon loogie, which Nell guessed must be swimming with safe mite bits."But there are people who break those rules sometimes.Who don't follow the protocols.And I guess if there's too many mites in the air all breaking down inside your lungs, millions well maybe those safe pieces aren't so safe if there's millions.But anyways, the guys at the Flea Circus say that sometimes the mites go to war with each other.Like maybe someone in Shanghai makes a mite that doesn't follow the protocol, and gets his matter compiler to making a whole lot of them, and sends them all across the water to New Atlantis Clave to snoop on the Vickys, or even maybe to do them harm.Then some Vicky one of their Protocol Enforcement guys makes a mite to go out and find that mite and kill it, and they get into a war.That's what's happening today, Nell.Mites fighting other mites.This dust we call it toner is actually the dead bodies of all those mites. ""When will the war be over?"Nell asked, but Harv could not hear her, having entered into another coughing jag.Eventually Harv got up and tied a strip of white Nanobar around his face.The spot over his mouth immediately began turning gray.He ejected used cartridges from his mite gun and inserted new ones.It was shaped like a gun, but it sucked air in instead of shooting things out.You loaded it with drum shaped cartridges filled with accordion pleated paper.When you turned it on, it made a little whooshing noise as it sucked air and hopefully mites through the paper.The mites got stuck in there."Gotta go," he said, goosing the trigger on the gun a couple of times."Never know what I might find. "Then he headed for the exit, leaving black toner footprints on the floor, which were scoured away by the swirling air currents in his wake, as if he had never passed that way.Hackworth compiles the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer;  particulars of the underlying technology.Bespoke was a Victorian house on a hill, a block long and replete with wings, turrets, atria, and breezy verandas.Hackworth was not senior enough to merit a turret or a balcony, but he did have a view into a garden where gardenia and boxwood grew.Sitting at his desk, he could not see the garden, but he could smell it, especially when the wind blew in from the sea.Runcible was sitting on his desk in the form of a stack of papers, most of them signed JOHN PERCIVAL HACKWORTH.He unfolded Cotton's document.It was still running the little industrial cartoon.Cotton had clearly enjoyed himself.No one ever got fired for going with enhanced photorealism, but Hackworth's own signature look was lifted from nineteenth century patent applications: black on white, shades of gray implied with nearly microscopic crosshatching, old fashioned letterpress font a little rough around the edges.It drove clients wild they always wanted to blow up the diagrams on their drawing room mediatrons.Cotton got it.He'd done his diagram in the same style, and so his nanotechnological battery chugged away on the page looking much like the gear train of an Edwardian dreadnought.Hackworth put Cotton's document atop the Runcible stack and guillotined it against the desktop a couple of times, superstitiously trying to make it look neat.He carried it to the corner of his office, over by the window, where a new piece of furniture had recently been rolled in by the porter: a cherrywood cabinet on brass casters.It came up to his waist.On top was a polished brass mechanism an automatic document reader with detachable tray.A small door in the back betrayed a Feed port, one centimeter, typical of household appliances but startlingly wimpy in a heavy industrial works, especially considering that this cabinet contained one of the most powerful computers on earth five cc's of Bespoke rod logic.It used about a hundred thousand watts of power, which came in over the superconducting part of the Feed.The power had to be dissipated, or else the computer would incinerate itself and most of the building too.Getting rid of that energy had been much more of an engineering job than the rod logic.The latest Feed protocol had a solution built in: a device could now pull ice off the Feed, one microscopic chunk at a time, and output warm water.Hackworth put the stack of documents into the feed tray on top and told the machine to compile Runcible.There was a card shuffling buzz as the reader grabbed the edge of each page momentarily and extracted its contents.The flexible Feed line, which ran from the wall into the back of the cabinet, jerked and stiffened orgasmically as the computer's works sucked in a tremendous jolt of hypersonic ice and shot back warm water.A fresh sheet of paper appeared in the cabinet's output tray.The top of the document read, "RUNCIBLE VERSION 1.0 COMPILED SPECIFICATION. "The only other thing on the document was a picture of the final product, nicely rendered in Hackworth's signature pseudo engraved style.It looked exactly like a book.On his way down the vast helical stair in the largest and most central of Bespoke's atria, Hackworth pondered his upcoming crime.It was entirely too late to go back now.It flustered him that he had unconsciously made up his mind months ago without marking the occasion.Though Bespoke was a design rather than a production house, it had its own matter compilers, including a couple of fairly big ones, a hundred cubic meters.Hackworth had reserved a more modest desktop model, one tenth of a cubic meter.Use of these compilers had to be logged, so he identified himself and the project first.Then the machine accepted the edge of the document.Hackworth told the matter compiler to begin immediately, and then looked through a transparent wall of solid diamond into the eutactic environment.The universe was a disorderly mess, the only interesting bits being the organized anomalies.Hackworth had once taken his family out rowing on the pond in the park, and the ends of the yellow oars spun off compact vortices, and Fiona, who had taught herself the physics of liquids through numerous experimental beverage spills and in the bathtub, demanded an explanation for these holes in water.She leaned over the gunwhale, Gwendolyn holding the sash of her dress, and felt those vortices with her hands, wanting to understand them.The rest of the pond, simply water in no particular order, was uninteresting.We ignore the blackness of outer space and pay attention to the stars, especially if they seem to order themselves into constellations."Common as the air" meant something worthless, but Hackworth knew that every breath of air that Fiona drew, lying in her little bed at night, just a silver glow in the moonlight, was used by her body to make skin and hair and bones.The air became Fiona, and deserving no, demanding of love.Ordering matter was the sole endeavor of Life, whether it was a jumble of self replicating molecules in the primordial ocean, or a steam powered English mill turning weeds into clothing, or Fiona lying in her bed turning air into Fiona.A leaf of paper was about a hundred thousand nanometers thick; a third of a million atoms could fit into this span.Smart paper consisted of a network of infinitesimal computers sandwiched between mediatrons.A mediation was a thing that could change its color from place to place; two of them accounted for about two thirds of the paper's thickness, leaving an internal gap wide enough to contain structures a hundred thousand atoms wide.Light and air could easily penetrate to this point, so the works were contained within vacuoles airless buckminsterfullerene shells overlaid with a reflective aluminum layer so that they would not implode en masse whenever the page was exposed to sunlight.The interiors of the buckyballs, then, constituted something close to a eutactic environment.Here resided the rod logic that made the paper smart.Each of these spherical computers was linked to its four neighbors, north east southwest, by a bundle of flexible pushrods running down a flexible, evacuated buckytube, so that the page as a whole constituted a parallel computer made up of about a billion separate processors.The individual processors weren't especially smart or fast and were so susceptible to the elements that typically only a small fraction of them were working, but even with those limitations the smart paper still constituted, among other things, a powerful graphical computer.And still, Hackworth reflected, it had nothing on Runcible, whose pages were thicker and more densely packed with computational machinery, each sheet folded four times into a sixteen page signature, thirty two signatures brought together in a spine that, in addition to keeping the book from falling apart, functioned as an enormous switching system and database.It was made to be robust, but it still had to be born in the eutactic womb, a solid diamond vacuum chamber housing a start matter compiler.The diamond was doped with something that let only red light pass through; standard engineering practice eschewed any molecular bonds that were tenuous enough to be broken by those lazy red photons, underachievers of the visible spectrum.Thus the growth of your prototype was visible through the window a good last ditch safety measure.If your code was buggy and your project grew too large, threatening to shatter the walls of the chamber, you could always shut it down via the ludicrously low tech expedient of shutting off the Feed line.Hackworth wasn't worried, but he watched the initial phases of growth anyway, just because it was always interesting.In the beginning was an empty chamber, a diamond hemisphere, glowing with dim red light.In the center of the floor slab, one could see a naked cross section of an eight centimeter Feed, a central vacuum pipe surrounded by a collection of smaller lines, each a bundle of microscopic conveyor belts carrying nanomechanical building blocks individual atoms, or scores of them linked together in handy modules.The matter compiler was a machine that sat at the terminus of a Feed and, following a program, plucked molecules from the conveyors one at a time and assembled them into more complicated structures.Hackworth was the programmer.Runcible was the program.It was made up of a number of subprograms, each of which had resided on a separate piece of paper until a few minutes ago, when the immensely powerful computer in Hackworth's office had compiled them into a single finished program written in a language that the matter compiler could understand.A transparent haze coalesced across the terminus of the Feed, mold on an overripe strawberry.The haze thickened and began adopting a shape, some parts a little higher than others.It spread across the floor away from the Feed line until it had filled out its footprint: one quadrant of a circle with a radius of a dozen centimeters.Hackworth continued to watch until he was sure he could see the top edge of the book growing out of it.In the corner of this lab stood an evolved version of a copy machine that could take just about any kind of recorded information and transmogrify it into something else.It could even destroy a piece of information and then attest to the fact that it had been destroyed, which was useful in the relatively paranoid environment of Bespoke.Hackworth gave it the document containing the compiled Runcible code and destroyed it.Provably.When it was finished, Hackworth released the vacuum and lifted the red diamond dome.The finished book stood upright atop the system that had extruded it, which was turned into a junkheap as soon as it was touched by the air.Hackworth picked up the book in his right hand and the extruder in his left, and tossed the latter into a junk bin.He locked the book in a desk drawer, picked up his top hat, gloves, and walking stick, stepped into his walker, and set off for the Causeway.Toward Shanghai.Nell & Harv's general living situation;  the Leased Territories;  Tequila.China was right across the water, and you could see it if you went down to the beach.The city there, the one with skyscrapers, was called Pudong, and beyond that was Shanghai.Harv went there with his friends sometimes.He said it was bigger than you could imagine, old and dirty and full of strange people and sights.They lived in the L. T. , which according to Harv was short for Leased Territories in letters.Nell already knew the mediaglyphics for it.Harv had also taught her the sign for Enchantment, which was the name of the Territory where they lived; it was a princess sprinkling golden specks from a stick onto some gray houses, which turned yellow and bright when the specks touched them.Nell thought that the specks were mites, but Harv insisted that mites were too small to be seen, that the stick was a magic wand and the specks were fairy dust.In any case, Harv made her remember that mediaglyph so that if she ever got lost, she could find her way home."But it's better if you just call me," Harv said, "and I'll come and find you. ""Why?""Because there's bad people out there, and you shouldn't walk through the L. T.  alone, ever. ""What bad people?"Harv looked troubled, heaved multiple sighs, fidgeted."You know that ractive I was in the other day, where there were pirates, and they tied up the kids and were going to make them walk the plank?""Yeah. ""There are pirates in the L. T.  too. ""Where?""Don't bother looking.You can't see 'em.They don't look like pirates, with the big hats and swords and all.They just look like normal people.But they're pirates on the inside, and they like to grab kids and tie 'em up. ""And make them walk the plank?""Something like that. ""Call the police!""I don't think the police would help.Maybe they would. "Police were Chinese.They came across the Causeway from Shanghai.Nell saw them up close once, when they came into the house to arrest Mom's boyfriend Rog.Rog wasn't home, just Nell and Harv were, and so Harv let them in and let them sit in the living room and fetched tea for them.Harv spoke some words of Shanghainese to them, and they grinned and ruffled his hair.He told Nell to stay in their bedroom and not come out, but Nell came out anyway and peeked.There were three policemen, two in uniforms and one in a suit, and they sat smoking cigarettes and watching something on the mediatron until Rog came back.Then they had an argument with him and took him out, shouting the whole way.After that, Rog didn't come around anymore, and Tequila started going out with Mark.Unlike Rog, Mark had a job.He worked in the New Atlantis Clave cleaning windows of the Vickys' homes.He would come home late in the afternoon all tired and dirty and take a long shower in their bathroom.Sometimes he would have Nell come into the bathroom with him and help scrub his back, because he couldn't quite reach one spot in the middle.Sometimes he would look at Nell's hair and tell her that she needed a bath, and then she would take off her clothes and climb into the shower with him and he would help wash her.One day she asked Harv whether Mark ever gave him a shower.Harv got upset and asked her a lot of questions.Later, Harv told Tequila about it, but Tequila had an argument with him and sent him to his room with one side of his face red and puffy.Then Tequila talked to Mark.They argued in the living room, the thumps booming through the wall as Harv and Nell huddled together in Harv's bed.Harv and Nell both pretended to go to sleep that night, but Nell heard Harv getting up and sneaking out of the house.She didn't see him for the rest of the night.In the morning, Mark got up and went to work, and then Tequila got up and put a lot of makeup all over her face and went to work.Nell was alone the whole day, wondering if Mark was going to make her take a shower that evening.She knew from the way Harv had reacted that the showers were a bad thing, and in a way it felt good to know this because it explained why it felt wrong.She did not know how to stop Mark from making her take the shower this evening.She told Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple about it.These four creatures were the only animals that had survived a great massacre perpetrated during the previous year by Mac, one of Mom's boyfriends, who in a fit of rage had gathered up all of the dolls and stuffed animals in Nell's room and stuffed them into the knacking hatch.When Harv had opened it up a few hours later, he had found all of the toys vanished except for these four.He had explained that the deke bin would only work on things that had come from the M. C. originally, and that anything that had been made "by hand" (a troublesome concept to explain) was rejected.Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple were old ragged things that had been made "by hand. "When Nell told them her story, Dinosaur was brave and said that she should fight Mark.Duck had some ideas, but they were silly ideas, because Duck was just a little kid.Peter thought she should run away.Purple thought she should use magic and sprinkle Mark with fairy dust; some of it would be like the mites that (according to Hanr) the Vickys used to protect themselves from bad people.In the kitchen was some food that Tequila had brought home last night, including chopsticks with little mediatrons built into their handles so that mediaglyphics ran up and down them while you ate.Nell knew that there must be mites in there, to make those mediaglyphics, and so she took one of the chopsticks as her magic wand.She also had a silvery plastic balloon that Harv had made her in the M. C.  All the air had gone out of it.She reckoned it would make a nice shield like she had once seen on the arm of a knight in one of Harv's ractives.She sat in the corner of the room on her mattress with Dinosaur and Purple in front of her, and Duck and Peter behind her, and waited, clutching her magic wand and her shield.But Mark didn't come home.Tequila came home and wondered where Mark was, but didn't seem to mind that he wasn't there.Finally Harv came back, late that night, after Nell had gone to bed, and hid something under his mattress.The next day Nell looked: It was a pair of heavy sticks, each about a foot long, joined in the middle by a short chain, and the whole thing was smeared with reddish brown stuff that had gone sticky and crusty.The next time Nell saw Harv, he told her that Mark was never coming back, that he was one of the pirates he'd warned her about, and that if anyone else ever tried to do such things to her, she should run away and scream and tell Harv and his friends right away.Nell was astonished; she had not understood just how tricky pirates were until this moment.Hackworth crosses the Causeway into Shanghai;  ruminations.The Causeway joining New Chusan and the Pudong Economic Zone was Atlantis/Shanghai's whole reason for existence, being in fact a titanic Feed restrained by mountainous thrust bearings at each end.From the standpoint of mass & cash flow, the physical territory of New Chusan itself, a lung of smart coral respiring in the ocean, was nothing more or less than the fountainhead of China's consumer economy, its only function to spew megatons of nanostuff into the Middle Kingdom's ever amplifying Feed network, reaching millions of new peasants every month.For most of its length the Causeway skimmed the high tide level, but the middle kilometer arched to let ships through; not that anyone really needed ships anymore, but a few recalcitrant swabbies and some creative tour operators were still plying the Yangtze estuary in junks, which looked precious underneath the catenary arch of the big Feed, strumming the ancient meets modern chord for adherents of the National Geographic worldview.As Hackworth reached the apogee, he could see similar Causeways to port and starboard, linking the outskirts of Shanghai with other artificial islands.Nippon Nano looked Fujiesque, a belt of office buildings around the waterline, houses above that, the higher the better, then a belt of golf courses, the whole top third reserved for gardens, bamboo groves, and other forms of micromanaged Nature.In the other direction was a little bit of Hindustan.The geotecture of their island owed less to the Mogul period than to the Soviet, no effort being made to shroud its industrial heart in fractal artifice.It squatted out there some ten kilometers from New Chusan, sabotaging many expensive views and serving as the butt of snotty wog jokes.Hackworth never joined in these jokes because he was better informed than most and knew that the Hindustanis stood an excellent chance of stomping all over the Victorians and the Nipponese in the competition for China.They were just as smart, there were more of them, and they understood the peasant thing.From the high point of the arch, Hackworth could look across the flat territory of outer Pudong and into the high rise district of metropolis.He was struck, as ever, by the sheer clunkiness of old cities, the acreage sacrificed, over the centuries, to various stabs at the problem of Moving Stuff Around.Highways, bridges, railways, and their attendant smoky, glinting yards, power lines, pipelines, port facilities ranging from sampan and junk to stevedore and cargo net to containership, airports.Hackworth had enjoyed San Francisco and was hardly immune to its charm, but Atlantis/Shanghai had imbued him with, the sense that all the old cities of the world were doomed, except possibly as theme parks, and that the future was in the new cities, built from the bedrock up one atom at a time, their Feed lines as integral as capillaries were to flesh.The old neighborhoods of Shanghai, Feedless or with overhead Feeds kludged in on bamboo stilts, seemed frighteningly inert, like an opium addict squatting in the middle of a frenetic downtown street, blowing a reed of sweet smoke out between his teeth, staring into some ancient dream that all the bustling pedestrians had banished to unfrequented parts of their minds.Hackworth was heading for one of those neighborhoods right now, as fast as he could walk.If you counterfeited directly from a Feed, it would be noticed sooner or later, because all matter compilers fed information back to the Source.You needed your very own private Source, disconnected from the Feed network, and this was a difficult thing to make.But a motivated counterfeiter could, with some ingenuity and patience, put together a Source capable of providing an assortment of simple building blocks in the range of ten to a hundred daltons.There were a lot of people like that in Shanghai, some more patient and ingenious than others.Hackworth in the hong of Dr.X.   The scalpel's edge was exactly one atom wide; it delaminated the skin of Hackworth's palm like an airfoil gliding through smoke.He peeled off a strip the size of a nailhead and proffered it to Dr.X, who snatched it with ivory chopsticks, dredged it through an exquisite cloisonn bowl filled with chemical dessicant, and arranged it on a small windowpane of solid diamond.Dr.X's real name was a sequence of shushing noises, disembodied metallic buzzes, unearthly quasi Germanic vowels, and half swallowed R's, invariably mangled by Westerners.Possibly for political reasons, he preferred not to pick a fake Western name like many Asians, instead suggesting, in a vaguely patronizing way, that they should just be satisfied with calling him Dr.X that letter being the first in the Pinyin spelling of his name.Dr.X placed the diamond slide into a stainless steel cylinder.At one end was a teflon gasketed flange riddled with bolt holes.Dr.X handed it to one of his assistants, who carried it with both hands, as if it were a golden egg on a silken pillow, and mated it with another flange on a network of massive stainless steel plumbing that covered most of two tabletops.The assistant's assistant got the job of inserting all the shiny bolts and torque wrenching them down.Then the assistant flicked a switch, and an old fashioned vacuum pump whacked into life, making conversation impossible for a minute or two.During this time Hackworth looked around Dr.X's laboratory, trying to peg the century and in some cases even the dynasty of each item.A row of mason jars stood on a high shelf, filled with what looked like giblets floating in urine.Hackworth supposed that they were the gall bladders of now extinct species, no doubt accruing value by the moment, better than any mutual fund.A locked gun cabinet and a primeval Macintosh desktop publishing system, green with age, attested to the owner's previous forays into officially discouraged realms of behavior.A window had been cut into one wall, betraying an airshaft no larger than a grave, from the bottom of which grew a gnarled maple.Other than that, the room was packed with so many small, numerous, brown, wrinkled, and organic looking objects that Hackworth's eyes lost the ability to distinguish one from the next.There were also some samples of calligraphy dangling here and there, probably snatches of poetry.Hackworth had made efforts to learn a few Chinese characters and to acquaint himself with some basics of their intellectual system, but in general, he liked his transcendence out in plain sight where he could keep an eye on it say, in a nice stained glass window not woven through the fabric of life like gold threads through a brocade.Everyone in the room could tell by its sound when the mechanical pump was finished with its leg of the relay.The vapor pressure of its own oil had been reached.The assistant closed a valve that isolated it from the rest of the system, and then they switched over to the nanopumps, which made no noise at all.They were turbines, just like the ones in jet engines but very small and lots of them.Casting a critical eye over Dr.X's vacuum plumbing, Hackworth could see that they also had a scavenger, which was a cylinder about the size of a child's head, wrinkled up on the inside into a preposterous surface area coated with nanodevices good at latching onto stray molecules.Between the nanopumps and the scavenger, the vacuum rapidly dropped to what you might expect to see halfway between the Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies.Then Dr.X himself quivered up out of his chair and began shuffling around the room, powering up a gallimaufry of contraband technology.This equipment came from diverse technological epochs and had been smuggled into this, the Outer Kingdom, from a variety of sources, but all of it contributed to the same purpose: It surveyed the microscopic world through X ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and direct nanoscale probing, and synthesized all of the resulting information into a single three dimensional view.If Hackworth had been doing this at work, he would already be finished, but Dr.X's system was a sort of Polish democracy requiring full consent of all participants, elicited one subsystem at a time.Dr.X and his assistants would gather around whichever subsystem was believed to be farthest out of line and shout at each other in a mixture of Shanghainese, Mandarin, and technical English for a while.Therapies administered included but were not limited to: turning things off, then on again; picking them up a couple of inches and then dropping them; turning off nonessential appliances in this and other rooms; removing lids and wiggling circuit boards; extracting small contaminants, such as insects and their egg cases, with nonconducting chopsticks; cable wiggling; incense burning; putting folded up pieces of paper beneath table legs; drinking tea and sulking; invoking unseen powers; sending runners to other rooms, buildings, or precincts with exquisitely calligraphed notes and waiting for them to come back carrying spare parts in dusty, yellowed cardboard boxes; and a similarly diverse suite of troubleshooting techniques in the realm of software.Much of this performance seemed to be genuine, the rest merely for Hackworth's consumption, presumably laying the groundwork for a renegotiation of the deal.Eventually they were looking at the severed portion of John Percival Hackworth on a meter wide sheet of mediatronic paper that one of the assistants had, with great ceremony, unfurled across a low, black lacquer table.They sought something that was bulky by nanotech standards, so the magnification was not very high even so, the surface of Hackworth's skin looked like a table heaped with crumpled newspapers.If Dr.X shared Hackworth's queasiness, he didn't show it.He appeared to be sitting with hands folded in the lap of his embroidered silk robe, but Hackworth leaned forward a bit and saw his yellowed, inch long fingernails overhanging the black Swiss cross of an old Nintendo pad.The fingers moved, the image on the mediation zoomed forward.Something smooth and inorganic unfolded at the top of their field of view: some kind of remotely controlled manipulator.Under Dr.X's direction it began to sift through the heap of desiccated skin.They found a lot of mites, of course, both natural and artificial.The natural ones looked like little crabs and had been quietly inhabiting the outer layers of other creatures' bodies for hundreds of millions of years.The artificial ones had all been developed in the past few decades.Most of them consisted of a spherical or ellipsoidal hull with various attachments.The hull was a vacuole, a wee bit of the eutactic environment to coddle the mite's machine phase innards.The hull's diamondoid structure was protected from the light by a thin layer of aluminum that made mites look like miniature spaceships only with the air on the outside and the vacuum inside.Attached to the hulls were various bits of gear: manipulators, sensors, locomotion systems, and antennas.The antennas were not at all like the ones on an insect they were usually flat patches studded with what looked like close cropped fuzz phased array systems for sweeping beams of visible light through the air.Most of the mites were also clearly marked with the manufacturer's name and a part number; this was demanded by Protocol.A few of them were unmarked.These were illicit and had been invented either by people like Dr.X; by outlaw phyles who spurned Protocol; or by the covert labs that most people assumed were run by all the zaibatsus.During half an hour's rooting around through Hackworth's skin, roaming around an area perhaps a millimeter on a side, they observed a few dozen artificial mites, not an unusual number nowadays.Almost all of them were busted.Mites didn't last very long because they were small but complicated, which left little space for redundant systems.As soon as one got hit with a cosmic ray, it died.They also had little space for energy storage, so many of them simply ran out of juice after a while.Their manufacturers compensated for this by making a lot of them.Nearly all of the mites were connected in some way with the Victorian immune system, and of these, most were immunocules whose job was to drift around the dirty littoral of New Chusan using lidar to home in on any other mites that might disobey protocol.Finding one, they killed the invader by grabbing onto it and not letting go.The Victorian system used Darwinian techniques to create killers adapted to their prey, which was elegant and effective but led to the creation of killers that were simply too bizarre to have been thought up by humans, just as humans designing a world never would have thought up tile naked mole rat.Dr.X took time out to zoom in on an especially freakish killer locked in a death grip around an unlabeled mite.This did not necessarily mean that Hackworth's flesh had been invaded, rather that the dead mites had become part of the dust on a table somewhere and been ground into his skin when he touched it.To illustrate the kind of mite he was presently looking for, Hackworth had brought along a cocklebur that he had teased from Fiona's hair after they had gone for a walk in the park.He had shown it to Dr.X, who had understood immediately, and eventually he found it.It looked completely different from all the other mites, because, as a cocklebur, its sole job was to stick to whatever touched it first.It had been generated a few hours previously by the matter compiler at Bespoke, which, following Hackworth's instructions, had placed a few million of them on the outer surface of the Illustrated Primer.Many of them had been embedded in Hackworth's flesh when he had first picked the book up.Many remained on the book, back at the office, but Hackworth had anticipated that.He made it explicit now, just so Dr.X and his staff wouldn't get any ideas: "The cocklebur has an internal timer," he said, "that will cause it to disintegrate twelve hours after it was compiled.We have six hours left in which to extract the information.It's encrypted, of course. "Dr.X smiled for the first time all day....Dr.X was the ideal man for this job because of his very disreputability.He was a reverse engineer.He collected artificial mites like some batty Victorian lepidopterist.He took them apart one atom at a time to see how they worked, and when he found some clever innovation, he squirreled it away in his database.Since most of these innovations were the result of natural selection, Dr.X was usually the first human being to know about them.Hackworth was a forger, Dr.X was a honer.The distinction was at least as old as the digital computer.Forgers created a new technology and then forged on to the next project, having explored only the outlines of its potential.Honers got less respect because they appeared to sit still technologically, playing around with systems that were no longer start, hacking them for all they were worth, getting them to do things the forgers had never envisioned.Dr.X selected a pair of detachable manipulator arms from his unusually large arsenal.Some of these had been copied from New Atlantan, Nipponese, or Hindustani designs and looked familiar to Hackworth; others, however, were bizarre naturalistic devices that seemed to have been torn loose from New Atlantan immunocules evolved structures, rather than designed.The Doctor employed two of these arms to grip the cocklebur.It was an aluminum covered megabuckyball in a sunburst of barbed spines, several of which were decorated with fragments of shishkebabed skin.Under Hackworth's direction he rotated the cocklebur until a small spine free patch came into view.A circular depression, marked with a regular pattern of holes and knobs, was set into the surface of the ball, like a docking port on the side of a spacecraft.Inscribed around the circumference of this fitting was his maker's mark: IOANNI HACVIRTUS FECIT.Dr.X did not need an explanation.It was a standard port.He probably had half a dozen manipulator arms designed to mate with it.He selected one and maneuvered its tip into place, then spoke a command in Shanghainese.Then he pulled the rig off his head and watched his assistant pour him another cup of tea."How long?"he said."About a terabyte," Hackworth said.This was a measure of storage capacity, not of time, but he knew that Dr.X was the sort who could figure it out.The ball contained a machine phase tape drive system, eight reels of tape rigged in parallel, each with its own read/write machinery.The tapes themselves were polymer chains with different side groups representing the logical ones and zeroes.It was a standard component, and so Dr.X already knew that when it was told to dump, it would spew out about a billion bytes a second.Hackworth had just told him that the total stored on the tapes was a trillion bytes, so they had a thousand seconds to wait.Dr.X took advantage of the time to leave the room, supported by assistants, and tend to some of the other parallel threads of his enterprise, which was known informally as the Flea Circus.Hackworth departs from Dr.X's laboratory;  further ruminations;  poem from Finkle McGraw;  encounter with ruffians.Dr.X's assistant swung the door open and nodded insolently.Hackworth swung his top hat into place and stepped out of the Flea Circus, blinking at the reek of China: smoky like the dregs of a hundred million pots of lapsang souchong, mingled with the sweet earthy smell of pork fat and the brimstony tang of plucked chickens and hot garlic.He felt his way across the cobbles with the tip of his walking stick until his eyes began to adjust.He was now poorer by several thousand ucus.A sizable investment, but the best a father could make.Dr.X's neighborhood was in the Ming Dynasty heart of Shanghai, a warren of tiny brick structures sheathed in gray stucco, topped with tiled roofs, frequently surrounded by stucco walls.Iron poles projected from the second story windows for drying clothes, so that in the narrow streets the buildings appeared to be fencing with each other.This neighborhood was near the foundation of the ancient city wall, built to keep out acquisitive Nipponese ronin, which had been torn down and made into a ring road.It was part of the Outer Kingdom, which meant that foreign devils were allowed, as long as they were escorted by Chinese.Beyond it, deeper into the old neighborhood, was supposedly a scrap of the Middle Kingdom proper the Celestial Kingdom, or C. K. , as they liked to call it where no foreigners at all were allowed.An assistant took Hackworth as far as the border, where he stepped into the Chinese Coastal Republic, an entirely different country that comprised, among many other things, virtually all of Shanghai.As if to emphasize this, young men loitered on corners in Western clothes, listening to loud music, hooting at women, and generally ignoring their filial duties.He could have taken an auto rickshaw, which was the only vehicle other than a bicycle or skateboard narrow enough to negotiate the old streets.But you never could tell what kind of surveillance might be present in a Shanghai taxi.The departure of a New Atlantis gentleman from the Flea Circus late at night could only stimulate the imaginations of the gendarmes, who had intimidated the criminal element to such a degree that they were now feeling restless and looking for ways to diversify.Sages, seers, and theoretical physicists could only speculate at what, if any, relationship might exist between the Shanghai Police Department's astonishing scope of activities and actual law enforcement: Deplorable, but Hackworth was thankful for it as he sampled the French Settlement's ramified backstreets.A handful of figures skulked across an intersection several blocks away, bloody light from a mediatron glancing off their patchwork Nanobar outfits, the kind of thing only street criminals would need to wear.Hackworth comforted himself by reasoning that this must be a gang from one of the Leased Territories who had just come over the Causeway.They wouldn't possibly be so rash as to assault a gentleman in the street, not in Shanghai.Hackworth detoured around the intersection anyway.Having never done anything illegal in his life, he was startled to understand, all of a sudden, that a ruthless constabulary was a crucial resource to more imaginative sorts of criminals, such as himself.Countless times that afternoon, Hackworth had been overcome by shame, and as many times he had fought it off with rationalization: What was so bad about what he was doing?He was not selling any of the new technologies that Lord Finkle McGraw had paid Bespoke to develop.He was not profiting directly.He was just trying to secure a better place in the world for his descendants, which was every father's responsibility.Old Shanghai was close to the Huang Pu; the mandarins had once sat in their garden pavilions enjoying the river view.Within a few minutes Hackworth had crossed a bridge into Pudong and was navigating narrow ravines between illuminated skyscrapers, heading for the coast a few miles farther to the east.Hackworth had been catapulted out of the rank and file and into Bespoke's elite ranks by his invention of the mediatronic chopstick.He'd been working in San Francisco at the time.The company was thinking hard about things Chinese, trying to one up the Nipponese, who had already figured out a way to generate passable rice (five different varieties, yet!)direct from Feed, bypassing the whole paddy/coolie rat race, enabling two billion peasants to hang up their conical hats and get into some serious leisure time and don't think for one moment that the Nipponese didn't already have some suggestions for what they might do with it.Some genius at headquarters, stewing over Nippon's prohibitive lead in nanotechnological rice production, decided the only thing for it was to leapfrog them by mass producing entire meals, from wonton all the way to digital interactive fortune cookies.Hackworth got the seemingly trivial job of programming the matter compiler to extrude chopsticks.Now, doing this in plastic was idiotically simple polymers and nanotechnology went together like toothpaste and tubes.But Hackworth, who'd eaten his share of Chinese as a student, had never taken well to the plastic chopsticks, which were slick and treacherous in the blunt hands of a gwailo.Bamboo was better and not that much harder to program, if you just had a bit of imagination.Once he'd made that conceptual leap, it wasn't long before he came up with the idea of selling advertising space on the damn things, chopstick handles and Chinese columnar script being a perfect match.Before long he was presenting it to his superiors: eminently user friendly bamboid chopsters with colorful advertising messages continuously scrolling up their handles in real time, like news headlines in Times Square.For that, Hackworth was kicked upstairs to Bespoke and across the Pacific to Atlantis/Shanghai.He saw these chopsticks everywhere now.To the Equity Lords, the idea had been worth billions; to Hackworth, another week's paycheck.That was the difference between the classes, right there.He wasn't doing that badly, compared to most other people in the world, but it still rankled him.He wanted more for Fiona.He wanted Fiona to grow up with some equity of her own.And not just a few pennies invested in common stocks, but a serious position in a major company.Starting your own company and making it successful was the only way.Hackworth had thought about it from time to time, but he hadn't done it.He wasn't sure why not; he had plenty of good ideas.Then he'd noticed that Bespoke was full of people with good ideas who never got around to starting their own companies.And he'd met a few big lords, spent considerable time with Lord Finkle McGraw developing Runcible, and seen that they weren't really smarter than he.The difference lay in personality, not in native intelligence.It was too late for Hackworth to change his personality, but it wasn't too late for Fiona.Before Finkle McGraw had come to him with the idea for Runcible, Hackworth had spent a lot of time pondering this issue, mostly while carrying Fiona through the park on his shoulders.He knew that he must seem distant to his daughter, though he loved her so but only because, when he was with her, he couldn't stop thinking about her future.How could he inculcate her with the nobleman's emotional stance the pluck to take risks with her life, to found a company, perhaps found several of them even after the first efforts had failed?He had read the biographies of several notable peers and found few common threads between them.Just when he was about to give up and attribute it all to random chance, Lord Finkle McGraw had invited him over to his club and, out of nowhere, begun talking about precisely the same issue.Finkle McGraw couldn't prevent his granddaughter Elizabeth's parents from sending her to the very schools for which he had lost all respect; he had no right to interfere.It was his role as a grandparent to indulge and give gifts.But why not give her a gift that would supply the ingredient missing in those schools?It sounds ingenious, Hackworth had said, startled by Finkle McGraw's offhanded naughtiness.But what is that ingredient?I don't exactly know, Finkle McGraw had said, but as a starting point, I would like you to go home and ponder the meaning of the word subversive.Hackworth didn't have to ponder it for long, perhaps because he'd been toying with these ideas so long himself.The seed of this idea had been germinating in his mind for some months now but had not bloomed, for the same reason that none of Hackworth's ideas had ever developed into companies.He lacked an ingredient somewhere, and as he now realized, that ingredient was subversiveness.Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw, the embodiment of the Victorian establishment, was a subversive.He was unhappy because his children were not subversives and was horrified at the thought of Elizabeth being raised in the stodgy tradition of her parents.So now he was trying to subvert his own granddaughter.A few days later, the gold pen on Hackworth's watch chain chimed.Hackworth pulled out a blank sheet of paper and summoned his mail.The following appeared on the page:  THE RAVEN A CHRISTMAS TALE, TOLD BY A SCHOOL BOY TO HIS LITTLE BROTHERS AND SISTERS by Samuel Taylor Coleridge (1798)  Underneath an old oak tree  There was of swine a huge company  That grunted as they crunched the mast:  For that was ripe, and fell full fast.Then they trotted away, for the wind grew high:  One acorn they left, and no more might you spy.Next came a Raven, that liked not such folly:  He belonged, they did say, to the witch Melancholy!Blacker was he than blackest jet,  Flew low in the rain, and his feathers not wet.He picked up the acorn and buried it straight  By the side of a river both deep and great.Where then did the Raven go?He went high and low,  Over hill, over dale, did the black Raven go.Many Autumns, many Springs  Travelled he with wandering wings:  Many summers, many Winters   I can't tell half his adventures.At length he came back, and with him a She  And the acorn was grown to a tall oak tree.They built them a nest in the topmost bough,  And young ones they had, and were happy enow.But soon came a Woodman in leathern guise,  His brow, like a pent house, hung over his eyes.He'd an axe in his hanth not a word he spoke,  But with many a hem!and a sturdy stroke,  At length he brought down the poor Raven's own oak.His young ones were killed; for they could not depart,  And their mother did die of a broken heart.The boughs from the trunk the Woodman did sever;  And they floated it down on the course of the river.They sawed it in planks, and its bark they did strip,  And with this tree and others they made a good ship.The ship, it was launched; but in sight of the land  Such a storm there did rise as no ship would withstand.It bulged on a rock, and the waves rush'd in fast;  Round and round flew the Raven, and cawed to the blast.He heard the last shriek of the perishing souls   See!see!o'er the topmast the mad water rolls!Right glad was the Raven, and off he went fleet,  And Death riding home on a cloud he did meet,  And he thank'd him again and again for this treat:  They had taken his all, and REVENGE IT WAS SWEET!Mr.Hackworth:  I hope the above poem illuminates the ideas I only touched on during our meeting of Tuesday last, and that it may contribute to your paroemiological studies.Coleridge wrote it in reaction to the tone of contemporary children's literature, which was didactic, much like the stuff they feed to our children in the "best" schools.As you can see, his concept of a children's poem is refreshingly nihilistic.Perhaps this sort of material might help to inculcate the sought after qualities.I look forward to further conversations on the subject.Finkle McGraw   This was only the starting point of development that had lasted for two years and culminated today.Christmas was just over a month away.Four year old Elizabeth Finkle McGraw would receive the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer from her grandfather.Fiona Hackworth would be getting a copy of the Illustrated Primer too, for this had been John Percival Hackworth's crime: He had programmed the matter compiler to place the cockleburs on the outside of Elizabeth's book.He had paid Dr.X to extract a terabyte of data from one of the cockleburs.That data was, in fact, an encrypted copy of the matter compiler program that had generated the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.He had paid Dr.X for the use of one of his matter compilers, which was connected to private Sources owned by Dr.X and not connected to any Feed.He had generated a second, secret copy of the Primer.The cockleburs had already self destructed, leaving no evidence of his crime.Dr.X probably had a copy of the program on his computers, but it was encrypted, and Dr.X was smart enough simply to erase the thing and free up the storage, knowing that the encryption schemes apt to be used by someone like Hackworth could not be cracked without divine intervention.Before long the streets widened, and the hush of tires on pavement blended with the buller of waves against the gradual shores of Pudong.Across the bay, the white lights of the New Atlantis Clave rose up above the particolored mosaic of the Leased Territories.It seemed a long way off, so on impulse Hackworth rented a velocipede from an old man who had set up a stall in the lee of the Causeway's thrust bearing.He rode out onto the Causeway and, invigorated by the cool moist air on his face and hands, decided to pedal for a while.When he reached the arch, he allowed the bike's internal batteries to carry him up the slope.At the summit he turned it off and began to coast down the other side, enjoying the speed.His top hat flew off.It was a good one, with a smart band that was supposed to make these mishaps a thing of the past, but as an engineer, Hackworth had never taken the manufacturer's promise seriously.Hackworth was going too fast to make a safe U turn, and so he put on the brakes.When he finally got himself turned around, he was unable to see his hat.He did see another cyclist coming toward him.It was a young man, covered in a slick Nanobar outfit.Except for his head, which was smartly adorned with Hackworth's top hat.Hackworth was prepared to ignore this jape; it was probably the only way the boy could safely get the hat down the hill, as prudence dictated keeping both hands on the handlebars.But the boy did not seem to be applying his brakes, and as he accelerated toward Hackworth, he actually sat up, taking both hands off the handlebars, and gripped the brim of the hat with both hands.Hackworth thought the boy was preparing to throw it back as he went by, but instead he pulled it down onto his head and grinned insolently as he shot past."Say!Stop right there!You have my hat!"Hackworth shouted, but the boy did not stop.Hackworth stood astride his bicycle and watched unbelievingly as the boy began to fade into the distance.Then he turned on the bicycle's power assist and began chasing him.His natural impulse had been to summon the police.But since they were on the Causeway, this would mean the Shanghai Police again.In any case, they could not possibly have responded fast enough to catch this boy, who was well on his way to the end of the Causeway, where he could fork off into any of the Leased Territories.Hackworth nearly caught him.Without the power assist it would have been no contest, as Hackworth exercised daily in his club while this boy had the pudgy, pasty look typical of thetes.But the boy had a considerable head start.By the time they reached the first ramp leading down into the Leased Territories, Hackworth was only ten or twenty meters away, just close enough that he could not resist following the boy down the ramp.An overhead sign read: ENCHANTMENT.They both picked up more speed on the ramp, and once again the boy reached up to grip the brim of the top hat.This time the bike's front wheel turned the wrong way.The boy erupted from the seat.The bicycle skittered into the irrelevant distance and clattered into something.The boy bounced once, rolled, and skidded for a couple of meters.The hat, its crown partially collapsed, rolled on its brim, toppled, and wobbled to a stop.Hackworth hit the brakes hard and overshot the boy for some distance.As before, it took him longer than he would have liked to get turned around.And then he knew for the first time that the boy was not alone but part of a gang, probably the same group he'd seen in Shanghai; that they'd followed him onto the Causeway and taken advantage of his fallen top hat to lure him into the Leased Territories; and that the rest of the gang, four or five boys on bicycles, was coming toward him down the ramp, coming fast; and in the fog of light from all of the Leased Territories' mediatronic billboards glittered the chromium chains of their nunchuks.Miranda;  how she became a ractor;  her early career.From the age of five, Miranda wanted to be in a ractive.In her early teens, after Mother had taken her away from Father and Father's money, she'd worked as a maid of all work, chopping onions and polishing people's sterling silver salvers, cake combs, fish trowels, and grape shears.As soon as she got good enough with hair and makeup to pass for an eighteen year old, she worked as a governess for five years, which paid a little better.With her looks she probably could have gotten a job as a lady's maid or parlormaid and become an Upper Servant, but she preferred the governess job.Whatever bad things her parents had done to her along the way, they had at least put her through some nice schools, where she'd learned to read Greek, conjugate Latin verbs, speak a couple of Romance languages, draw, paint, integrate a few simple functions, and play the piano.Working as a governess, she could put it all to use.Besides, she preferred even bratty children to adults.When the parents finally dragged their worn out asses home to give their children Quality Time, Miranda would run to her subterranean quarters and get into the cheapest, trashiest ractive she could find.She wasn't going to make the mistake of spending all her money being in fancy ractives.She wanted to be a payee, not a payer, and you could practice your racting just as well in a dead shoot 'em up as a live Shakespeare.As soon as she had saved up her ucus, she made the long dreamed of trip to the mod parlor, strode in with her jawline riding high as the hull of a clipper ship above a black turtleneck, looking very like a ractor, and asked for the Jodie.That turned a few heads in the waiting room.From there on it was all very good, madam, and please make yourself comfortable here and would you like tea, madam.It was the first time since she and her mother had left home that anyone had offered her tea, instead of ordering her to make some, and she knew perfectly well it would be the last time for several years, even if she got lucky.The tat machine worked on her for sixteen hours; they dripped Valium into her arm so she wouldn't whine.Most tats nowadays went on like a slap on the back."You sure you want the skull?""Yeah, I'm sure. ""Positive?""Positive. ""Okay " and SPLAT there was the skull, dripping blood and lymph, blasted through your epidermis with a wave of pressure that nearly knocked you out of the chair.But a dermal grid was a whole different thing, and a Jodie was top of the line, it had a hundred times as many 'sites as the lo res grid sported by many a porn starlet, something like ten thousand of them in the face alone.The grossest part was when the machine reached down her throat to plant a trail of nanophones from her vocal cords all the way up to her gums.She closed her eyes for that one.She was glad she'd done it on the day before Christmas because she couldn't have handled the kids afterward.Her face swelled up just like they said it would, especially around the lips and eyes where the 'site density was greatest.They gave her creams and drugs, and she used them.The day after that, her mistress double taked when Miranda came upstairs to fix the children breakfast.But she didn't say anything, probably assuming she'd gotten slapped around by a drunken boyfriend at a Christmas party.Which was hardly Miranda's style, but it was a comfortable assumption for a New Atlantan woman to make.When her face had gotten back to looking exactly the same as it had before her trip to the tat parlor, she packed everything she owned into a carpet bag and took the tube into the city.The theatre district had its good end and its bad end.The good end was exactly what and where it had been for centuries.The bad end was a vertical rather than a horizontal development, being a couple of old office skyscrapers now fallen into disreputable uses.Like many such structures they were remarkably unpleasant to look at, but from the point of view of a ractive company, they were ideal.They had been designed to support a large number of people working side by side in vast grids of semiprivate cubicles."Let's have a gander at your grid, sweetheart," said a man identifying himself as Mr.Fred ("not my real name") Epidermis, after he had removed his cigar from his mouth and given Miranda a prolonged, methodical, full body optical grope."My grid ain't no Sweetheart," she said.SweetheartTM and HeroTM were the same grid as purveyed to millions of women and men respectively.The owners didn't want to be ractors at all, just to look good when they happened to be in a ractive.Some were stupid enough to fall for the hype that one of these grids could serve as the portal to stardom; a lot of those girls probably ended up talking to Fred Epidermis."Ooh, now I'm all curious," he said, writhing just enough to make Miranda's lip curl."Let's put you on stage and see what you got. "The cubicles where his ractors toiled were mere head stages.He had a few body stages, though, probably so he could bid on fully ractive porn.He pointed her toward one of these.She walked in, slammed the door, turned toward the wall size mediatron, and got her first look at her new Jodie.Fred Epidermis had put the stage into Constellation Mode.Miranda was looking at a black wall speckled with twenty or thirty thousand individual pricks of white light.Taken together, they formed a sort of three dimensional constellation of Miranda, moving as she moved.Each point of light marked one of the 'sites that had been poked into her skin by the tat machine during those sixteen hours.Not shown were the filaments that tied them all together into a network a new bodily system overlaid and interlaced with the nervous, lymph, and vascular systems."Holy shit!Got a fucking Hepburn or something here!"Fred Epidermis was exclaiming, watching her on a second monitor outside the stage."It's a Jodie," she said, but she stumbled over the words as the field of stars moved, tracking the displacements of her jaw and lips.Outside, Fred Epidermis was wielding the editing controls, zooming in on her face, which was dense as a galactic core.By comparison, her arms and legs were wispy nebulas and the back of her head nearly invisible, with a grand total of maybe a hundred 'sites placed around her scalp like the vertices of a geodesic dome.The eyes were empty holes, except (she imagined) when she closed her eyes.Just to check it out, she winked into the mediatron.The 'sites on her eyelids were dense as grass blades on a putting green, but accordioned together except when the lid expanded over the eye.Fred Epidermis recognized the move and zoomed in so violently on her winking eye that she nearly threw herself back on her ass.She could hear him chortling."You'll get used to it, honey," he said."Just hold still so I check the 'sites on your lips. "He panned to her lips, rotated them this way and that, as she puckered and pursed.She was glad they'd drugged her out of her mind while they were doing the lips; thousands of nanosites in there."Looks like we got ourselves an artiste here," Fred Epidermis said."Lemme try you in one of our most challenging roles. "Suddenly a blond, blue eyed woman was standing in the mediatron, perfectly aping Miranda's posture, wearing big hair, a white sweater with a big letter F in the middle, and a preposterously short skirt.She was carrying big colored puffy things.Miranda recognized her, from old passives she'd seen on the mediatron, as an American teenager from the previous century."This is Spirit.A little old fashioned to you and me, but popular with tube feeders," said Fred Epidermis."'Course your grid's way overkill for this, but hey, we're about giving the customer what they want moving those bids, you know. "But Miranda wasn't really listening; for the first time ever, she was watching another person move exactly as she moved, as the stage mapped Miranda's grid onto this imaginary body.Miranda pressed her lips together as if she'd just put on lipstick, and Spirit did the same.She winked, and Spirit winked.She touched her nose, and Spirit got a face full of pom pon."Let's run you through a scene," said Fred Epidermis.Spirit vanished and was replaced by an electronic form with blanks for names, numbers, dates, and other data.He flashed through it before Miranda could really read it; they didn't need a contract for a dry run.Then she saw Spirit again, this time from two different camera angles.The mediatron had split up into several panes.One was a camera angle on Spirit's face, which still did whatever Miranda's face did.One was a two shot showing Spirit and an older man, standing in a room full of big machines.Another pane showed a closeup of the old man, who as Spirit realized was being played by Fred Epidermis.The old man said, "Okay, keep in mind we usually play this through a head stage, so you don't control Spirit's arms and legs, just her face "  "How do I walk around?"Miranda said.Spirit's lips moved with hers, and from the mediatron came Spirit's voice squeaky and breathy at the same time.The stage was programmed to take the feeds from the nanophones in her throat and disp them into a different envelope."You don't.Computer decides where you go, when.Our dirty little secret: This isn't really that ractive, it's just a plot tree but it's good enough for our clientele because all the leaves of the tree the ends of the branches, you understand are exactly the same, namely what the payer wants you to follow?Well, you'll see," said the old man on the screen, reading Miranda's confusion in Spirit's face.What looked like guarded skepticism on Miranda came across as bubble brained innocence on Spirit."Cue!Follow the fucking cues!This isn't improv workshop!"shouted the old man.Miranda checked the other panes on the display.One she reckoned was a map of the room, showing her location and the old man's, with arrows occasionally pulsing in the direction of movement.The other was a prompter, with a line waiting for her, flashing red."Oh, hello, Mr.Willie!"she said, "I know school's out, and you must be very tired after a long day of teaching shop to all of those nasty boys, but I was wondering if I could ask you for a big, big favor. ""Certainly, go ahead, whatever," said Fred Epidermis through the face and body of Mr.Willie, not even pretending to emote."Well, it's just that I have this appliance that's very important to me, and it seems to have broken.I was wondering if you knew how to fix one of these," Miranda said.On the mediatron, Spirit said the same thing.But Spirit's hand was moving.She was holding something up next to her face.An elongated glossy white plastic thing.A vibrator."Well," said Mr.Willie, "it's a scientific fact that all electrical devices work on the same principles, so in theory I should be able to help you.But I must confess, I've never seen an appliance quite like that one.Would you mind explaining what it is and what it does?""I'd be more than happy to " said Miranda, but then the display froze and Fred Epidermis cut her off by shouting through the door."Enough already," he said."I just had to make sure you could read. "He opened the stage door and said, "You're hired.Cubicle 238.My commission is eighty percent.The dormitory's upstairs pick your own bunk, and clean it out.You can't afford to live anywhere else. "Harv brings Nell a present;  she experiments with the Primer.When Harv came back home, he was walking with all of his weight on one foot.When the light struck the smudges on his face in the right way, Nell could see streaks of red mixed in with the dirt and the toner.He was breathing fast, and he swallowed heavily and often, as though throwing up were much on his mind.But he was not empty handed.His arms were crossed tightly across his belly.He was carrying things in his jacket."I made out, Nell," he said, seeing his sister's face and knowing that she was too scared to talk first."Didn't get much, but got some.Got some stuff for the Flea Circus. "Nell wasn't sure what the Flea Circus was, but she had learned that it was good to have stuff to take there, that Harv usually came back from the Flea Circus with an access code for a new ractive.Harv shouldered the light switch on and kneeled in the middle of the room before relaxing his arms, lest some small thing fall out and be lost in a corner.Nell sat in front of him and watched.He took out a piece of jewelry swinging ponderously at the end of a gold chain.It was circular, smooth gold on one side and white on the other.The white side was protected under a flattened glass dome.It had numbers written around the edge, and a couple of slender metal things like daggers, one longer than the other, joined at their hilts in the center.It made a noise like mice trying to eat their way through a wall in the middle of the night.Before she could ask about it, Harv had taken out other things.He had a few cartridges from his mite trap.Tomorrow Harv would take the cartridge down to the Flea Circus and find out if he'd caught anything, and whether it was worth money.There were other things like buttons.But Harv saved the biggest thing for last, and he withdrew it with ceremony."I had to fight for this, Nell," he said."I fought hard because I was afraid the others would break it up for parts.I'm giving it to you. "It appeared to be a flat decorated box.Nell could tell immediately that it was fine.She had not seen many fine things in her life, but they had a look of their own, dark and rich like chocolate, with glints of gold."Both hands," Harv admonished her, "it's heavy. "Nell reached out with both hands and took it.Harv was right, it was heavier than it looked.She had to lay it down in her lap or she'd drop it.It was not a box at all.It was a solid thing.The top was printed with golden letters.The left edge was rounded and smooth, made of something that felt warm and soft but strong.The other edges were indented slightly, and they were cream colored.Harv could not put up with the wait."Open it," he said."How?"Harv leaned toward her, caught the upper right corner under his finger, and flipped it.The whole lid of the thing bent upward around a hinge on the left side, pulling a flutter of cream colored leaves after it.Underneath the cover was a piece of paper with a picture on it and some more letters.On the first page of the book was a picture of a little girl sitting on a bench.Above the bench was a thing like a ladder, except it was horizontal, supported at each end by posts.Thick vines twisted up the posts and gripped the ladder, where they burst into huge flowers.The girl had her back to Nell; she was looking down a grassy slope sprinkled with little flowers toward a blue pond.On the other side of the pond rose mountains like the ones they supposedly had in the middle of New Chusan, where the fanciest Vickys of all had their stival houses.The girl had a book open on her lap.The facing page had a little picture in the upper left, consisting of more vines and flowers wrapped around a giant egg shaped letter.But the rest of that page was nothing but tiny black letters without decoration.Nell turned it and found two more pages of letters, though a couple of them were big ones with pictures drawn around them.She turned another page and found another picture.In this one, the little girl had set aside her book and was talking to a big black bird that had apparently gotten its foot tangled up in the vines overhead.She flipped another page.The pages she'd already turned were under her left thumb.They were trying to work their way loose, as if they were alive.She had to press down harder and harder to keep them there.Finally they bulged up in the middle and slid out from underneath her thumb and, flop flop flop, returned to the beginning of the story."Once upon a time," said a woman's voice, "there was a little girl named Elizabeth who liked to sit in the bower in her grandfather's garden and read story books. "The voice was soft, meant just for her, with an expensive Victorian accent.Nell slammed the book shut and pushed it away.It slid across the floor and came to rest by the sofa.The next day, Mom's boyfriend Tad came home in a bad mood.He slammed his six pack down on the kitchen table, pulled out a beer, and headed for the living room.Nell was trying to get out of the way.She picked up Dinosaur, Duck, Peter Rabbit, and Purple, her magic wand, a paper bag that was actually a car her kids could drive around in, and a piece of cardboard that was a sword for killing pirates.Then she ran for the room where she and Harv slept, but Tad had already come in with his beer and begun rooting through the stuff on the sofa with his other hand, trying to find the control pad for the mediatron.He threw a lot of Harv's and Nell's toys on the floor and then stepped on the book with his bare foot."Ouch, god damn it!"Tad shouted.He looked down at the book in disbelief."What the fuck is this?!"He wound up as if to kick it, then thought better of it, remembering he was barefoot.He picked it up and hefted it, looking straight at Nell and getting a fix on her range and azimuth."Stupid little cunt, how many times do I have to tell you to keep your flicking shit cleaned up!"Then he turned away from her slightly, wrapping his arm around his body, and snapped the book straight at her head like a frisbee.She stood watching it come toward her because it did not occur to her to get out of the way, but at the last moment the covers flew open.The pages spread apart.They all bent like feathers as they hit her in the face, and it didn't hurt at all.The book fell to the floor at her feet, open to an illustrated page.The picture was of a big dark man and a little girl in a cluttered room, the man angrily flinging a book at the little girl's head."Once upon a time there was a little girl named Cunt," the book said."My name is Nell," Nell said.A tiny disturbance propagated through the grid of letters on the facing page."Your name's mud if you don't fucking clean this shit up," Tad said."But do it later, I want some fucking privacy for once. "Nell's hands were full, and so she shoved the book down the hallway and into the kids' room with her foot.She dumped all her stuff on her mattress and then ran back and shut the door.She left her magic wand and sword nearby in case she should need them, then set Dinosaur, Duck, Peter, and Purple into bed, all in a neat to be a bird.Big letters appeared beneath."R A V E N," the book said."Raven.Now, say it with me. ""Raven. ""Very good!Nell, you are a clever girl, and you have much talent with words.Can you spell raven?"Nell hesitated.She was still blushing from the praise.After a few seconds, the first of the letters began to blink.Nell prodded it.The letter grew until it had pushed all the other letters and pictures off the edges of the page.The loop on top shrank and became a head, while the lines sticking out the bottom developed into legs and began to scissor."R is for Run," the book said.The picture kept on changing until it was a picture of Nell.Then something fuzzy and red appeared beneath her feet."Nell Runs on the Red Rug," the book said, and as it spoke, new words appeared."Why is she running?""Because an Angry Alligator Appeared," the book said, and panned back quite some distance to show an alligator, waddling along ridiculously, no threat to the fleet Nell.The alligator became frustrated and curled itself into a circle, which became a small letter."A is for Alligator.The Very Vast alligator Vainly Viewed Nell's Valiant Velocity. "The little story went on to include an Excited Elf who was Nibbling Noisily on some Nuts.Then the picture of the Raven came back, with the letters beneath."Raven.Can you spell raven, Nell?"A hand materialized on the page and pointed to the first letter."R," Nell said."Very good!You are a clever girl, Nell, and good with letters," the book said."What is this letter?"and it pointed to the second one.This one Nell had forgotten.But the book told her a story about an Ape named Albert.A young hooligan before the court of Judge Fang;  the magistrate confers with his advisers;  Justice is served."The revolving chain of a nunchuk has a unique radar signature reminiscent of that of a helicopter blade, but noisier," Miss Pao said, gazing up at Judge Fang over the half lenses of her phenomenoscopic spectacles.Her eyes went out of focus, and she winced; she had been lost in some enhanced three dimensional image, and the adjustment to dull reality was disorienting."A cluster of such patterns was recognized by one of Shanghai P. D.'s sky eyes at ten seconds after 2351 hours. "As Miss Pao worked her way through this summary, images appeared on the big sheet of mediatronic paper that Judge Fang had unrolled across his brocade tablecloth and held down with carved jade paperweights.At the moment, the image was a map of a Leased Territory called Enchantment, with one location, near the Causeway, highlighted.In the corner was another pane containing a standard picture of an anticrime sky eye, which always looked, to Judge Fang, like an American football as redesigned by fetishists: glossy and black and studded.Miss Pao continued, "The sky eye dispatched a flight of eight smaller aerostats equipped with cine cameras. "The kinky football was replaced by a picture of a teardrop shaped craft, about the size of an almond, trailing a whip antenna, with an orifice at its nose protected by an incongruously beautiful iris.Judge Fang was not really looking; at least three quarters of the cases that came before him commenced with a summary almost exactly like this one.It was a credit to Miss Pao's seriousness and diligence that she was able to tell each story afresh.It was a challenge to Judge Fang's professionalism for him to listen to each one in the same spirit."Converging on the scene," Miss Pao said, "they recorded activities. "The large map image on Judge Fang's scroll was replaced by a cine feed.The figures were far away, flocks of relatively dark pixels nudging their way across a rough gray background like starlings massing before a winter gale.They got bigger and more clearly defined as the aerostat flew closer to the action.A man was curled on the street with his arms wrapped around his head.The nunchuks had been put away by this point, and hands were busy going through the innumerable pockets that were to be found in a gentleman's suit.At this point the cine went into slow mo.A watch flashed and oscillated hypnotically at the end of its gold chain.A silver fountain pen glowed like an ascending rocket and vanished into the folds of someone's mite proof raiment.And then out came something else, harder to resolve: larger, mostly dark, white around the edge.A book, perhaps."Heuristic analysis of the cine feeds suggested a probable violent crime in progress," Miss Pao said.Judge Fang valued Miss Pao's services for many reasons, but her deadpan delivery was especially precious to him."So the sky eye dispatched another flight of aerostats, specialized for tagging. "An image of a tagger stat appeared: smaller and narrower than the cinestats, reminiscent of a hornet with the wings stripped off.The nacelles containing the tiny air turbines, which gave such devices the power to propel themselves through the air, were prominent; it was built for speed."The suspected assailants adopted countermeasures," Miss Pao aaid, again using that deadpan tone.On the cine feed, the criminals were retreating.The cinestat followed them with a nice tracking shot.Judge Fang, who had watched thousands of hours of film of thugs departing from the scenes of their crimes, watched with a discriminating eye.Less sophisticated hoodlums would simply have run away in a panic, but this group was proceeding methodically, two to a bicycle, one person pedaling and steering while the other handled the countermeasures.Two of them were discharging fountains of material into the air from canisters on their bicycles' equipment racks, like fire extinguishers, waving the nozzles in all directions."Following a pattern that has become familiar to law enforcement," Miss Pao said, "they dispersed adhesive foam that clogged the intakes of the stats' air turbines, rendering them inoperative. "The big mediatron had also taken to emitting tremendous flashes of light that caused Judge Fang to close his eyes and pinch the bridge of his nose.After a few of these, the cine feed went dead."Another suspect used strobe illumination to pick out the locations of the cinestats, then disabled them with pulses of laser light evidently using a device, designed for this purpose, that has recently become widespread among the criminal element in the L. T. "The big mediatron cut back to a new camera angle on the original scene of the crime.Across the bottom of the scroll was a bar graph depicting the elapsed time since the start of the incident, and the practiced Judge Fang noted that it had jumped backward by a quarter of a minute or so; the narrative had split, and we were now seeing the other fork of the plot.This feed depicted a solitary gang member who was trying to climb aboard his bicycle even as his comrades were riding away on contrails of sticky foam.But the bike had been mangled somehow and would not function.The youth abandoned it and fled on foot.Up in the corner, the small diagram of the tagging aerostat zoomed in to a high magnification, revealing some of the device's internal complications, so that it began to look less like a hornet and more like a cutaway view of a starship.Mounted in the nose was a device that spat out tiny darts drawn from an interior magazine.At first these were almost invisibly tiny, but as the view continued to zoom, the hull of the tagging aerostat grew until it resembled the gentle curve of a planet's horizon, and the darts became more clearly visible.They were hexagonal in crosssection, like pencil stubs.When they were shot out of the tag stat's nose, they sprouted cruel barbs at the nose and a simple empennage at the tail."The suspect had experienced a ballistic interlude earlier in the evening," Miss Pao said, "regrettably not filmed, and relieved himself of excess velocity by means of an ablative technique. "Miss Pao was outdoing herself.Judge Fang raised an eyebrow at her, briefly hitting the pause button.Chang, Judge Fang's other assistant, rotated his enormous, nearly spherical head in the direction of the defendant, who was looking very small as he stood before the court.Chang, in a characteristic gesture, reached up and rubbed the palm of his hand back over the short stubble that covered his head, as if he could not believe he had such a bad haircut.He opened his sleepy, slitlike eyes just a notch, and said to the defendant, "She say you have road rash. "The defendant, a pale asthmatic boy, had seemed too awed to be scared through most of this.Now the corners of his mouth twitched.Judge Fang noticed with approval that he controlled the impulse to smile."Consequently," Miss Pao said, "there were lapses in his Nanobar integument.An unknown number of tag mites passed through these openings and embedded themselves in his clothing and flesh.He discarded all of his clothing and scrubbed himself vigorously at a public shower before returning to his domicile, but three hundred and fifty tag mites remained in his flesh and were later extracted during the course of our examination.As usual, the tag mites were equipped with inertial navigation systems that recorded all of the suspect's subsequent movements. "The big cine feed was replaced by a map of the Leased Territories with the suspect's movements traced out with a red line.This boy did a lot of wandering about, even going into Shanghai on occasion, but he always came back to the same apartment."After a pattern was established, the tag mites automatically spored," Miss Pao said.The image of the barbed dart altered itself, the midsection which contained a taped record of the dart's movements breaking free and accelerating into the void."Several of the spores found their way to a sky eye, where their contents were downloaded and their serial numbers checked against police records.It was determined that the suspect spent much of his time in a particular apartment.Surveillance was placed on that apartment.One of the residents clearly matched the suspect seen on the cine feed.The suspect was placed under arrest and additional tag mites found in his body, tending to support our suspicions. ""Oooh," Chang blurted, absently, as if he'd just remembered something important."What do we know about the victim?"Judge Fang said."The cine stat could track him only as far as the gates of New Atlantis," Miss Pao said."His face was bloody and swollen, complicating identification.He had also been tagged, naturally the tagger aerostat cannot make any distinction between victim and perpetrator but no spores were received; we can assume that all of his tag mites were detected and destroyed by Atlantis/Shanghai's immune system. "At this point Miss Pao stopped talking and swiveled her eyes in the direction of Chang, who was standing quiescently with his hands clasped behind his back, staring down at the floor as if his thick neck had finally given way under the weight of his head.Miss Pao cleared her throat once, twice, three times, and suddenly Chang came awake."Excuse me, Your Honor," he said, bowing to Judge Fang.He rummaged in a large plastic bag and withdrew a gentleman's top hat in poor condition."This was found at the scene," he said, finally reverting to his native Shanghainese.Judge Fang dropped his eyes to the tabletop and then looked up at Chang.Chang stepped forward and placed the hat carefully on the table, giving it a little nudge as if its position were not quite perfect.Judge Fang regarded it for a few moments, then withdrew his hands from the voluminous sleeves of his robe, picked it up, and flipped it over.The words JOHN PERCIVAL HACKWORTH were written in gold script on the hatband.Judge Fang cast a significant look at Miss Pao, who shook her head.They had not yet contacted the victim.Neither had the victim contacted them, which was interesting; John Percival Hackworth must have something to hide.The neo Victorians were smart; why did so many of them get mugged in the Leased Territories after an evening of brothel crawling?"You have recovered the stolen items?"Judge Fang said.Chang stepped to the table again and laid out a man's pocket watch.Then he stepped back, hands clasped behind him, bent his neck again, and watched his feet, which could not contain themselves from shuffling back and forth in tiny increments.Miss Pao was glaring at him."There was another item?A book, perhaps?"Judge Fang said.Chang cleared his throat nervously, suppressing the urge to hawk and spit an activity Judge Fang had barred in his courtroom.He turned sideways and backed up one step, allowing Judge Fang to view one of the spectators: a young girl, perhaps four years old, sitting with her feet up on the chair so that her face was blocked by her knees.Judge Fang heard the sound of a page turning and realized that the girl was reading a book propped up on her thighs.She cocked her head this way and that, talking to the book in a tiny voice."I must humbly apologize to the Judge," Chang said in Shanghainese."My resignation is hereby proffered. "Judge Fang took this with due gravity."Why?""I was unable to wrest the evidence from the young one's grasp," Chang said."I have seen you kill adult men with your hands," Judge Fang reminded him.He had been raised speaking Cantonese, but could make himself understood to Chang by speaking a kind of butchered Mandarin."Age has not been kind," Chang said.He was thirty six."The hour of noon has passed," said Judge Fang."Let us go and get some Kentucky Fried Chicken. ""As you wish, Judge Fang," said Chang."As you wish, Judge Fang," said Miss Pao.Judge Fang switched back to English."Your case is very serious," he said to the boy."We will go and consult the ancient authorities.You will remain here until we return. ""Yes, sir," said the defendant, abjectly terrified.This was not the abstract fear of a first time delinquent; he was sweating and shaking.He had been caned before.The House of the Venerable and Inscrutable Colonel was what they called it when they were speaking Chinese.Venerable because of his goatee, white as the dogwood blossom, a badge of unimpeachable credibility in Confucian eyes.Inscrutable because he had gone to his grave without divulging the Secret of the Eleven Herbs and Spices.It had been the first fast food franchise established on the Bund, many decades earlier.Judge Fang had what amounted to a private table in the corner.He had once reduced Chang to a state of catalepsis by describing an avenue in Brooklyn that was lined with fried chicken establishments for miles, all of them ripoffs of Kentucky Fried Chicken.Miss Pao, who had grown up in Austin, Texas, was less easily impressed by these legends.Word of their arrival preceded them; their bucket already rested upon the table.The small plastic cups of gravy, coleslaw, potatoes, and so on had been carefully arranged.As usual, the bucket was placed squarely in front of Chang's seat, for he would be responsible for consumption of most of it.They ate in silence for a few minutes, communicating through eye contact and other subtleties, then spent several minutes exchanging polite formal chatter."Something struck a chord in my memory," Judge Fang said, when the time was right to discuss business."The name Tequila the mother of the suspect and of the little girl. ""The name has come before our court twice before," Miss Pao said, and refreshed his memory of two previous cases: one, almost five years ago, in which this woman's lover had been executed, and the second, only a few months ago, a case quite similar to this one."Ah, yes," Judge Fang said, "I recall the second case.This boy and his friends beat a man severely.But nothing was stolen.He would not give a justification for his actions.I sentenced him to three strokes of the cane and released him. ""There is reason to suspect that the victim in that case had molested the boy's sister," Chang put in, "as he has a previous record of such accomplishments. "Judge Fang fished a drumstick out of the bucket, arranged it on his napkin, folded his hands, and sighed."Does the boy have any filial relationships whatsoever?""None," said Miss Pao."Would anyone care to advise me?"Judge Fang frequently asked this question; he considered it his duty to teach his subordinates.Miss Pao spoke, using just the right degree of cautiousness."The Master says, 'The superior man bends his attention to what is radical.That being established, all practical courses naturally grow up.Filial piety and fraternal submission!are they not the root of all benevolent actions?'"How do you apply the Master's wisdom in this instance?""The boy has no father his only possible filial relationship is with the State.You, Judge Fang, are the only representative of the State he is likely to encounter.It is your duty to punish the boy firmly say, with six strokes of the cane.This will help to establish his filial piety. ""But the Master also said, 'If the people be led by laws, and uniformity sought to be given them by punishments, they will try to avoid the punishments, but have no sense of shame.Whereas, if they be led by virtue, and uniformity sought to be given them by the rules of propriety, they will have the sense of shame, and moreover will become good. '""So you are advocating leniency in this case?"Miss Pao said, somewhat skeptically.Chang chimed in: "'Mang Wu asked what filial piety was.
