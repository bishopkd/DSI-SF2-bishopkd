They need us, Swan said.Thats why they took Alex up on her proposal to help them in the first place.Well, this will be a test of how much they think they need us.Swan shook her head like a dog.Genette saw that she did not want to think about the Vulcanoids right now.She was annoyed perhaps at Mqarets move to the next step, even as they were staring down at the glowing ruins.Wahram was more attentive to her mood.Remembrance of a particular form is but regret for a particular moment; and houses, roads, avenues are as fugitive, alas, as the years.Swan scowled at him.More fortune cookies, oh deep one?Yes.A tiny smile; he still had the capacity to be amused by her, Genette saw, even after their confinement together.Maybe he had even learned it there.It was striking how little they had said about their time in the tunnel.Now Swan said, I want to join Inspector Genettes investigation, if thats all right, Inspector?Id like to be the Mercurial liaison to your investigation.We can always use help, Genette said diplomatically.This incident is of grave concern to everyone, but of course for Mercury it goes right to the heart of things.I was assuming you would therefore want someone to join the investigation.Good, Swan said.Ill keep in touch with the design team, she told Mqaret.There was no more talk of some kind of self mortifying art performance; although it occurred to the inspector that the investigation itself might eventually be seen as such.When they got back to the spaceport, Wahram nodded and took his leave of Genette.Then he turned to Swan, bowing very slightly, with hand on heart.I must return to Saturn and attend to business I missed.Well meet again soon, Im sure.Terminator will rise like a phoenix, and then there will be all kinds of unfinished business for us to complete.There most certainly will, she said.Suddenly she hugged him, put her head briefly against his broad chest.She stood back.Thank you for saving me.Im sorry I was so messed up down there.Not at all, Wahram said.You saved me.And we got through.And with another awkward bow he left.Lists (5)  the Vesta Zone, a cloud of terraria forming a single cooperative  Aymara, an amazonia with an interior completely overgrown with cloud forest  Tatar Soul, a steppes grassland where people speak a resuscitated Indo European  The Copenhagen Interpretation, a canal town with a gift economy  The Zanzibar Cat, an anarchist savanna with thousands of big cats and no interior buildings at all  Arabia Deserta, a desert occupied by British travelers  Aspen, a skiing paradise  unnamed prison asteroids with robot guards  Hermaphrodite, where all permanent residents are gynandromorphs and androgyns  Saint George, a social terrarium in which the men think they are living in a Mormon polygamy, while the women consider it a lesbian world with a small percentage of male lesbians  asteroids hollowed not into cylindrical terraria but rather warrens, hives, caves, pits, hotels, etc.The Maldives, an aquarium recreating the drowned islands;

already she was forgetting that.Let Pauline remember that.Never look back, why should she?Although there had been something thereas if she had been on the border of something important.What had he said?That the tunnel was no different from anywhere else?She would never concede that, never.When she was about to leave with Genette and the Interplan team, Mqaret came to see her again.Youre so tough, he told her, patting her head as if she were a child.But he took her seriously, she knew.So she shook her head.No, she said flatly.I fell apart.I couldnt handle it.He defended her fondly.Its not really what youre good at, of course.Enforced confinement.Dont ever get put in prison, or shoot off in a spacesuit on a tangent somewhere.It wouldnt suit you.Yet here you did very well, I think.I dont see how.Well, this solar flare that struck you before you got to shelter; your suit dosimeters show that somehow you got hit much harder than the others down there with you.In fact, I dont mean to scare you, because youre going to be fineIve already got your renovation well in hand, and you are responding superblybut really, that was quite a hit.Ten sieverts, she said dismissively.Thats not so bad.Quite bad, actually.Did you look at the sun longer than the others?Did you stand in front of your friend?Yes, I did, but Im only half as wide as him.Im sure I didnt protect him much.He only got three sieverts.So youre only a bit thinner than he is, really.You saved him from the full shot.And then he saved me.He had to carry me for a few days.Fairs fair.But look, this ten sievertsthats enough to kill, and you should have been debilitated.But you will be fine, as I said.So Im interested to see if we can find out why you did so well.Ive been wondering if your Enceladan symbiote had anything to do with it.It tolerates radiation well, and as a detrivore it may have bloomed in you to eat all the new food provided for it by all your killed cells.It may have joined your own T cells in clearing your body.Swan was startled by this.You hated me doing that, she said.You told me I was a stupid fool.Mqaret nodded.I was right, too.Look, Swan; if you love life, as you profess to do, as your excuse for all your wildness, then you should protect your life the best you can.Some actions are simply unknown risks, and that was one of them.Indeed it still is.But it was a risk only, not a certain thing.Presumably thats why you did it.Youre not suicidal, right?Right, she said uncertainly.So youre a fool, then, when you do things that you cant be sure wont kill you in ten or even a hundred years.Then were all fools.True.True enough.But theres no need to be a stupid fool.Theres a difference?There is.You think about that and see if you can figure out the difference.Hopefully before you do something like this again.If anything like this is even possible.He had been poking a pad and looking at her numbers as they spoke, and now he shrugged.With your permission, Ill take some of your samples back to the lab for study.Maybe it will lead to something.Of course, she said.It would be nice if something good came from my stupid foolishness.He kissed her on the head.Something more than what you already give, you mean.After Mqaret was gone, Swan was left to think about her stupid foolishness.Her body, emaciated on the bed, swimming under her gaze like someone else, a thing she manipulated like a waldoit was resilient.It still held her.Was hungry.She buzzed the nurse to ask for food.Pauline, please transmit my medical history to this tabletop.Would you like the long version or the summary?The summary, Swan said, knowing that the long version ran to hundreds of pages.She looked at the print glowing in the table, but could not force herself to read it.Phrases jumped out from all over it: Born 2177, a difficult birth, she had been told, with moments of low oxygen.Seizures age 2.Fungal and bacterial infections in farm school.Wetland syndrome.ADHD, age 410  That had been countered with a drug treatment later discredited.Her later schooling had been conducted in the farm, and she had done much better out there.Except there were more words glowing in the table: Dyscalculia.prefrontal cortex electrostimulation.First sabbatical inoculation for Xinjiang, China, age 15, full array including helminths  meaning parasitic worms, in this case Trichuris suis, a pig whipworm, ingested in a therapy that seesawed in and out of favor.ODD, age 1524  Oppositional defiant disorder, related to anxiety disorder, both hippocampal, but anxiety avoided while ODD attacked.One g syndrome, second sabbatical in Montpellier, France, age 25.Venusian flu.Genital modification, age 25.Hormone drip implanted, age 35, hormone therapies to present.Oxytocin addiction, age 3786.Lark and warbler song cluster implant, age 26.Feline purr vocal cords, age 27.Implant of subdural quantum computer in 2222, age 45.Cognitive therapy, age 999.Fathered one female at age 28.Daughter deceased, 2296.Mothered one female at age 63.Natural birth.There was a line entered in her records by Mqaret: Ingestion of the Enceladan life formfoolish girl, age 79.Longevity treatments, age 40present.Factitious disorder, never treatedthis must have been inserted by either Mqaret or Pauline, making fun of her.What about Designed a hundred terraria?Swan complained.What about three years spent in the Oort cloud putting mass drivers on ice balls?Or five years on Venus?Those were not medical events, Pauline said.They were, believe me.If you want your curriculum vitae, just ask for it.Be quiet.Go away.You are too good at simulating an irritating person.Did you say simulating or stimulating?Extracts (7)  The longevity increase associated with bisexual therapies has led to very sophisticated surgical and hormonal treatments for interventions in utero, in puberty, and during adulthood.The XX/XY dichotomy still exists, but in the context of a wide variety of habit, usage, and terminology  feeling of gender identity is formed in the hippocampus and hypothalamus in the second month; the original orientation is persistent.If the desire is to create a feeling of undifferentiation or ambivalence, alterations need to begin in utero  in the first eight weeks of gestation keep both the Mllerian and Wolffian ducts active, in what is still the bi potential gonad.Anti Mllerian hormones activated by genes in the Y chromosome can be allowed to attach only to one of the fetal Mllerian ducts.The effect is normally ipsilateral, each testis suppressing Mllerian development only on its own side, so  XY embryos then need a moderate level of androgen insensitivity introduced by the fourth week, in order to avoid masculinization of the hypothalamus, where sexual differences in the brain will be concentrated.XX embryos need the application of androgens to one Mllerian duct in order to stimulate the growth of a Wolffian duct.As that Wolffian duct develops, the Mllerian duct on that side will experience apoptosis  underlying genetic makeup is the difference between androgyny and gynandromorphy, often not discernable by body features.XX humans with conserved Wolffian ducts are gynandromorphs; XY humans with conserved Mllerian ducts are androgyns.In both, androgens and estrogens are supplied with hormone pumps such that the child is born with potential for both kinds of genital development in the body, awaiting the choices  prenatally selected bisexuality has the strongest positive correlation with longevity.Hormonal treatments begun at puberty or during adulthood also have positive effects on longevity, but the psychological set will be  hormonal treatments support the surgical addition of a functioning uterus in the abdominal wall above the penis  alteration of the clitoris into a small functioning penis, with testicles grown using either conserved Wolffian ducts or stem cells from the subject.Gynandromorphs can ordinarily father only daughters, as the construction of a Y chromosome from an X chromosome involves problematic  females adding functional reproductive masculinity are helped by a process imitating a natural 5 alpha reductase deficiency  principal categories of self image for gender include feminine, masculine, androgynous, gynandromorphous, hermaphroditic, ambisexual, bisexual, intersex, neuter, eunuch, nonsexual, undifferentiated, gay, lesbian, queer, invert, homosexual, polymorphous, poly, labile, berdache, hijra, two spirit,  cultures deemphasizing gender are sometimes referred to as ursuline cultures, origin of term unknown, perhaps referring to the difficulty there can be in determining the gender of bears      KIRAN ON VENUS  The moment Kiran was alone with Shukra, Shukra said to him, Were going to have to put you through some tests, my boy.What kind of tests?All kinds.Three big men showed up to escort them across a few boulevards of Colette, and Kiran saw there was no question of him doing anything but what he was told.As they entered a building with bay windows overlooking a street corner, he tried to see the street signs and remember where they were.Eighth and Oak.Although the tree across the intersection was a willow.Tell me again why Swan brought you here?Shukra asked as they went into the building.I helped her avoid being kidnapped, when she was out in my neighborhood.She wanted to return the favor.Shukra said, You asked to come here?Sort of.Shukra shook his head a few times.So now you are a spy.What do you mean?Shukra glanced at him.Youre a spy for her, at this point, whether you know it or not.Well find out with our tests.After that youll be a spy for me.Why should she need a spy here?She was very close to the Lion of Mercury, and since the Lions death, she has started traveling in the way that the Lion would have.And the Lion always kept a big cadre of spies here.So lets see what the tests say.Kiran found his heart was beating hard, but the three big men closed around him, and there was no choice but to be escorted into another room.This one had the look of a medical clinic.The tests in the end resembled medical exams more than anything else, which was a great relief to discover.Although when medical exams are the good option, it is not a good situation.At the end of that day he was escorted back into Shukras presence.Shukra examined the console that presumably contained Kirans results.When he spoke, it was to Kirans escorts.He looks clean, but somehow I doubt it.For now, lets use him for bait.After that Kiran was assigned to a Chinese work unit, which lived together in a building near the citys crater rim, and left the city together almost daily to do work outside.The units members had no control over their lives; they went where they were told, did what they were told, ate what they were given.It was almost like being at home.A stupid little translation belt Swan had given to him was now the only company Kiran had.He got a lot of puzzled second glances when he used the thing to facilitate communication, but he also had a few ten minute conversations through it that were much better than nothing.Mostly, however, he was on his own in a throng, doing whatever came up for his team that day.He never saw Shukra again after the battery of tests, which made him feel like he had failedalthough one day it occurred to him that maybe he had passed.In any case there was endless work to be done, almost all of it outside Colette, in the perpetual blizzard that the Big Rain had turned into.Thick drifts of snow were landing on the new dry ice seas before the latter had been completely covered with foamed rock, and this was creating a problem.Every day big teams had to go out and operate gargantuan bulldozers and snowplows to clear the snow off the dry ice, so that foamed rock brigades could then cover the ice before more snow fell on it.It was said that the foam job would take ten more years to finish, but Kiran had also heard one year, and someone else said a hundred years.No one knew for sure, and with his belt it was hard to follow the discussions at the dining table after meals, when sometimes workmates would try to do the calculations themselves on their wristpads.Ten years kept coming up.Talk about dead end jobs!He needed to improve his Chinese.At night he slept in a dorm.This was the most interesting part, because people were packed in on long mattresses that his belt called matrazenlageressentially mattresses as long as the room, with numbers on the headboards marking nominal slots for people, a situation leading to a fair bit of sex in the dark, sometimes even including him.Then up in the morning, eat in a cafeteria, get in a line to get sent out onto the endless plain in rovers, or put in helicopters the size of aircraft carriers to be carried out to the dry ice sea to operate bulldozers, waldoes, snowblowers (the so called dragons), super zambonis, and ice cutters much like the asphalt and concrete cutting vehicles back in Jersey, but a hundred times bigger.After a few weeks he could operate any of these.They werent very complicated; really you told the AI what to do for the most part.It was like being captain of a ship.A days work by a team of a thousand would clear many square kilometers of dry ice, and on the horizon the black moving buildings that spread the foamed rock followed inexorably.The far shore of this part of the ice sea was said to be six hundred kilometers away.Then for a matter of some weeks he worked in a monumental waldo, kicking free what they called stegosaur plates, then carrying them over to the bed of a giant truck.Waldo work was always demandingit was full body movement, like dancingnot physically hard, but as it magnified your every motion, it required very close attention and focus to move the waldo in just the way you wanted it to go.So it could be interesting work or just a matter of lifting and carrying, but either way it left you fried.At the ends of these days he tried to work on his Chinese.No one he met spoke English, so his little translation belt was his best teacher, but it was hard.He would say things to it and then listen to the translation and try to say it back.But when he said it back in Chinese, and it translated what hed said back into English, it never came out right.He said, My radar is broken, in exactly the Chinese he thought he had heard, and it translated back to him immediate open air meeting.He tried Where do you live?and it came back as Your lotus has interpolated.If only!he said, laughing bleakly.Id like my lotus to interpolate, but how?Clearly he must be sounding crazy to the people he talked to.He was doing something wrong, but what?It is a hard language, one of his dorm mates said when he complained.He tried to memorize that properly.As it was, his translator was his best friend.They talked a lot.He hoped to start getting more out of it soon.Saying hello and how are you?and such was working better and better with the people he interacted with.And they were getting friendlier about talking slow.The workers continued to chip away at the monumental tasks set before them, tasks thousands of times bigger than similar jobs on Earth.But if the job was shoveling snow, was that a good thing?Once he sent a message to Swan to say he was glad to hear she had survived the attack on Terminator, and in it he mentioned that he never saw Shukra anymore.A message came back a few weeks later: Try Lakshmi.With a Venusian cloud address.He looked into this and found that Lakshmi was a name that caused people to go silent and look away.A big power, based over in Cleopatra; an ally of Shukras, or an enemypeople didnt really know, or didnt want to say.So: maybe Swan wanted to shift her informant to a place closer to the action.Or maybe she was just trying to help.Or maybe he was just on his own.Lists (6)  boreal forest (conifers);

the inspector would sit right on the table while eating, on a plush brought for the purpose, and afterward lounge there on one elbow with a drink, so that they spoke eye to eye.It was a little like talking to a cat.Only two?she said.Two.First, who did it, and second, how we can find and catch this agent without giving more people the idea of doing it.The so called copycat problem, and more generally, the problem of preventing any kind of repetition of this attack.That I consider to be the more difficult problem of the two.What about how it was done?Swan asked.Isnt that a problem too?I know how it happened, the inspector said easily.You do?I think so.Its the only way it could have happened, I think, and so there you have it.No matter how implausible, as the line has it, although in this case its not implausible at all.But I must confess to you, I dont want to say more about it when we are both being recorded by our qubes.Genette raised a wrist and indicated the thick, almost cubical little wristpad that contained Passepartout.You have your qube recording always, I assume?No.But often?Yes, I suppose so.Like anyone else.Well, in any case I want to see some things in the belt before I will be sure of my hypothesis.So well talk about this more when were out there.But I want you to think about the second problem; assuming we catch a perpetrator and explain the deed, perhaps in a prosecutionhow are we going to keep someone else from doing it?This is where I think you could help me.They were traveling in the terrarium Moldava, which ran in an Aldrin cycle that would take them out to Vesta in eight days.The interior of the Moldava was given over to growing wheat, and many of the people traveling in it congregated after their days labor in the fields at a resort on high ground near the bow, set on a broad hilltop, overlooking and then looking up at the upcurve of a big patchwork pattern of fields, different green and gold textures created by the many different strains being grown.It was like a quilters version of heaven.Swan spent much of her time talking to the local ecologists, who had lots of little wheat disease problems they wanted to discuss.Inspector Jean stayed in the Interplan rooms and, as they passed Mars, spent time calling ahead to people in the terraria clustered around Vesta.At the ends of these days Swan would meet with the Interplan group to eat, then talk late with the inspector.Sometimes she talked about her daytime work.The locals were trying out wheat varieties that shed water from the seed heads better, and were exploring the genetic creation of microscopic drip tips like those seen in the macro world of tropical leaves, where the drip tips were long tips on the leaves that allowed water to break its surface tension and run away.I want to have drip tips in my brain, she said.I dont want to hold on to anything that will hurt me.I wish you luck with that, the little inspector said politely, staying focused on the meal, and eating a lot for such a small person.A few days later they came to the Vesta Zone, one of the crowded areas of the asteroid belt.During the Accelerando many terraria had relocated near each other, creating something like communities, and the Vesta Zone was among the largest of these.Moldava released a ferry with the Interplan team on it, and when the ferry had decelerated and was near Vesta, they transferred again, this time to an Interplan ship with an Interplan crew.This was an impressively fast little spaceship named Swift Justice, and in short order they were moving against the flow of the great current of asteroids, stopping once or twice at little rocks for the inspector to talk with people.No explanation for these conversations was offered, and Swan held off asking, while they visited the Orinoco Fantastico, the Crimea, the Oro Valley, Irrawady 14, Trieste, Kampuchea, the John Muir, and the Winnipeg, after which she just had to ask.All these little worlds had recent perturbations in their orbits, the inspector explained, and I wanted to ask if they had explanations for them.And had they?There were some abrupt departures from the Vesta Zone, apparently, and people think those threw the neighbors off course.Vesta itself proved to be very substantial for an asteroidsix hundred kilometers in diameter, roughly spherical, and entirely tented, which made it one of the biggest examples of the paraterraforming method called bubble wrapping.Usually tents covered only parts of a moon, like the older domes; they were the most common structures on Callisto and Ganymede and Luna, but those moons were all so big that covering them entirely hadnt even been considered.To cover a little moon with a tentlike bubble represented the next stage, and a viable outie option to the hollowed out innie worlds.Swan supposed that Terminator itself was a case of paraterraforming, though she was not used to thinking of it that way and had a prejudice against outies in the asteroid belt as being overexposed and low g, compared to burrowing into a rock and spinning it.But now, as she regarded Vesta from a short distance out, it looked good.It was a place that would have weather and a sky (the tenting was located two kilometers above the surface), and Pauline told her the Vestans had established boreal forests, alpine ranges, tundra, grassland, and lots of cold desert.All that would be in very low g, which meant everyone would be flying and dancing around a lot, in a puffy, almost floating landscape.Not such a bad idea.They even had an immense mountain.So Swan was interested to visit Vesta, but Genette had a different destination in mind, and after a few more Interplan people joined them, they headed to a nearby terrarium called Yggdrasil.As they approached Yggdrasil Swan saw it was yet another potato asteroid, in this case dark and unspinning.Its abandoned, the inspector explained.A cold case.In the hoppers lock Swan floated to the suit rack with a graceful little pli, suited up, then followed Genette and several Interplan investigators out the outer lock door into the void.Yggdrasil had been a standard innie, perhaps thirty kilometers long.They entered it by way of a big hole left in the stern; the mass driver had been removed.They jetted in gently, using their suits thrusters to keep them upright.Flowing forward side by side, they looked like a reversal of one of those pharaonic statue pairs in which the sister wife is knee high to the monarch.Inside they jetted to a halt.The interior of the asteroid was a pure black, dotted with a few distant reflections of their headlamp beams.Swan had been in many a terrarium under construction, but this was not like those.Genette tossed ahead a bright lamp, jetted briefly to counteract the toss.The pinpoint flare floated forward through the empty space, illuminating the cylinder quite distinctly.Swan spun a little under the force of her own looking around.So dim, so abandoned; she spun in some gust of emotion that perhaps came from her poor Terminator: fist to her faceplate, suddenly she heard herself moaning.Yes, the little silver figure floating by her said.There was a pressure failure here, with no warning.This was a chondrite and water ice conglomerate asteroid, very common.The accident review found a small meteorite had by chance hit an undetected seam of ice in the cylinder wall, vaporizing it and depressurizing the interior catastrophically.It wasnt the first time something like that had happened, although in this case the rock readers had given it a triple A rating.Usually the ones that have cracked have been Bs or Cs, and were occupied unwisely.So Ive been reanalyzing old accidents, looking for certain flags, and decided I wanted to have a look at this one.Mainly at the outside, but first I wanted to check the inside.A lot of people died?Yes, around three thousand.It happened very fast.Some people were in buildings with shelters they got to in time, and others were near spacesuits, or air locks.Other than them, the whole city state died.The survivors decided to leave it empty as a memorial.So this is like a cemetery now.Yes.Theres a memorial in here somewhere, I think on the other side.I want to take a look at the inner surface of the break.The inspector consulted with Passepartout, then led Swan through the interior space to a boulevard on the other side of the cylinder.The neighborhood here had a Parisian scale, with wide streets running between trapezoidal housing blocks four and five stories tall.They hovered over an area of crumpled pavements and tilted buildings, which resembled old photos of earthquake damaged areas on Earth.It was strange how still it was.Arent there enough nickel iron asteroids around that no one needs to hollow a conglomerate?Swan asked.You would think so.But they hollowed out a few of these and found they worked fine.Keep the walls thick enough and the rotation and interior air pressure are nowhere near enough to test them.They should work and they do.But this one broke.A little meteor hit just the wrong spot.They floated over an area where the intense buckling had left plates of white concrete thrown up and out, leaving a long gash between them.The gash was open to space; Swan could see stars through it.They left the devastated street and floated back out of the asteroid.Outside they toed and jetted over the surface of the rock, negotiating the typical asteroid mini g.  Swan had spent some time in this g during her terrarium building days, and she saw that the inspector was expert in it, which of course made sense for someone based in the asteroid belt.When they got to the outside location of the open seam, they found several of the Interplan team already at work around it.Genette made a few balletic leaps, twisting in descent to float down headfirst, taking photos of the inside of the rupture.Close inspection of a few small pits to each side was accomplished by way of one handed handstands, faceplate centimeters from the rock.After a while: I think Ive got what I need.They floated there, watching the others continue to work.Genette said, You have a qube there in your skull, isnt that right?Yes.Pauline, say hello to Inspector Genette.Hello to Inspector Genette.Can you turn it off?the inspector asked.Yes, of course.Will you be turning off yours?Yes.If that is indeed what really happens when we turn them off.Through the faceplates Swan could see the inspectors ironic smile.All right, Passepartout has been put to sleep.Has Pauline?Swan had indeed pressed the pad under the skin on the right side of her neck.Yes.Very good.All right, now we can talk a little more openly.Tell me, when your qube is on, is it recording what you hear and see?Normally, yes.Of course.And does it have direct contact with any other qubes?Direct contact?Do you mean quantum entanglement?No, no.Decoherence makes that impossible, we are told.I only mean radio contact.Well, Pauline has a radio receiver and transmitter, but I select what goes in and out.Can you be sure of that?Yes, I think so.I set the tasks and she does them.I can check everything shes done in her records.The little silver figure was shaking its head dubiously.Isnt it the same for you?Swan asked.I think so, Genette said.Im just not so sure about all the qubes that are not Passepartout.Why?Do you think qubes may be involved with what happened here?Or on Mercury?Yes.Swan stared in surprise at what seemed to be a big spacesuited doll floating beside her, feeling a little afraid of it.Its voice was in her ear because of her helmet mike, speaking from almost within her, much as Pauline did.A clear high countertenor, pleasant and amused.There are quite a few little crater pits to each side of the break here.Like that one Genette pointed with a forefinger, and a green laser dot appeared on the rim of a small pit, quickly circled the rim, then fixed at its center.See that?And then that?Circling another one.They were very small.These are fresh enough that they may have happened during or after the break.So, ejecta?No.Gravity here is so slight, the ejecta seldom come back.If anything did, it would almost dock.These pits are deeper.Swan nodded.The asteroids lumpy surface had many rocks lying loosely on it.So what did the accident report call these craters?Anomalies.They speculated they might be pit ruptures, where ice deposits melted at the heat of impact.Could be.But I take it you have looked at the accident report for Terminator?Yes.Do you remember there were anomalies there too?Whatever struck the tracks didnt hit cleanly.There are outlier craters, very small, that were not there before the event.Now, on Mercury they could be ejecta coming back down, I grant you that  Couldnt the impactor have broken up coming in?But that usually happens where theres an atmosphere heating and slowing it.Couldnt Mercurys gravity do it?That effect would be negligible.I dont know, so maybe it didnt break up.The little figure nodded.Yes, thats right.What do you mean?It didnt break up.In fact, it came together.What do you mean?I mean it was never comglomerated, until the very last moment.Thats why none of the detection systems on Mercury saw it coming.They should have seen it, it had to come from somewhere, and yet it was not detected by the surveillance systems.So to me this indicates an MDL problem.Minimum detection limit.Because there is always a minimum limit of detection, either inherent to the detection method, or else artificially set higher than the actual minimum.Why do that?Usually to keep warnings from going off all the time when there isnt really any danger.Ah.So, each system is different, but in the Mercurial defense apparatus, what they call the method reporting level is almost equivalent to the systems method detection limit.In other words they set their reporting level at twice the detection level, which is six or seven times the standard deviation in their measurement variability.Its a typical setting to make people comfortable theyll generate both the fewest false negatives and the fewest false positives.So, but consider what then lies below that reporting level.Basically, only very little rockspebbles, well less than a kilogram each.But if there were a lot of them, and they converged only at the last second, with each one coming in from a different quadrant of the sky, and at a different speed, but timed such that they all arrived at the same spot, at the same time Then they would just be little pebbles, until the last second.They could have been tossed from the far side of the solar system, maybe, and over a number of years, maybe.And yet even so, if thrown correctly, eventually they make their rendezvous.Many thousands of them, let us say.So, a kind of smart mob.But not even smart.Just rocks.Could that work?I mean, could anything calculate how hard to throw them, and on what trajectory?A qube could.With enough of the solar systems masses identified as to locations and trajectory, and enough calculating power, it can be done.I asked Passepartout to do itto calculate an orbit for something like a ball bearing or a boccino, thrown from the asteroid belt to hit a particular target on Mercury.It didnt take long.But could the throws be made?I mean, would it be possible to build a launcher that would launch them with the necessary precision?Passepartout said there are machines in existence with tolerances two or three magnitudes more precise than would be necessary.One would only need a steady launch platform.The stabler the better, in creating consistency.Thats quite a shot, Swan said.How many masses get included in the trajectory calculation?I think Passepartout included the heaviest ten million objects in the solar system.And we know where all those are?Yes.Which is to say the AIs know where they are.And all the biggest terraria and spaceships conform to itineraries set years in advance.As for the calculations, it takes a qube to be able to do it in a reasonable amount of time, meaning fast enough to use it for real time launch instructions.How long does it take?For a qube similar to Passepartout, three seconds.For conventional AIs, about a year per pebble, which of course would render the method inoperable.You have to have quantum computing to be able to do it.Swan was feeling sick to her stomach, as if she were back in the utilidor.So ten thousand little rocks thrown downsystem, over a matter of months or years, with such directions and velocities that they all arrive at one spot at the same time.Yes.And a few stochastic gravitational fluctuations no doubt cause a little bit of scatter at the end.Indeed when that happens, those pebbles must usually miss entirely.But some just barely miss.Exactly.Like these little pits we see.Caused perhaps by a spaceship that changed flight plans, or the like.So maybe one or two percent of the pebbles experience a clinamen of this sort, or so Passepartout guesses.Now the wrench in her gut was getting severe.So someone is doing this on purpose.She waved at the abandoned terrarium.Thats right.And also, a qube has to be involved.Shit.She put an arm across her stomach.But how how could someone  The inspector put a little hand to her arm.Ygassdril floated under them, cold and dead.A gray potato.Lets get back to the Justice.Back inside the Interplan hopper, after they had eaten a meal, Swan stayed up late in the galley, and again the inspector did too.Swan, who had not been able to stop thinking about the days revelations, said, So, all this means that whoever  Genette raised both hands and stopped her.Qubes off again, please.After they had both turned off the devices, she continued: That means whoever did this could have done it years ago.Or at least quite some time ago, yes.Some stretch of time.And there wasnt a single launch site.No.But maybe there is still the launch mechanism.Their gun, or catapult, or whatever it was, would have to be a very precise instrument.A particularly fine bit of manufacturing.The tolerances Passepartout suggested were really quite fine, requiring molecular printers and so forth.We might be able to find the factory that made something so particularwere looking into that.And then, who might have ordered it.What else?Swan asked.We are looking for the program for the factory, and the design of the instrument.Its printing instructions.Also the orbital program needed to make the calculations.Qubes dont make that kind of thing up without being asked to do itor so we have been assuming until now.The qube that did it would have that action recorded in it, as I understand it.And so the program is likely to still exist somewhere.And there are still only a finite number of factories making qubes.Couldnt they have destroyed their qube when they were done using it?Yes.But theres no reason to assume theyre done.This was a chilling thought.We must look for the qube, the orbit program, the factory program, also the factory, and the launcher itself, and whatever the launch platform was.Swan frowned.All those could be destroyed, or cleaned pretty clean.Its true.You see the nature of the problem very quickly.Even so, this investigation has to turn into a check of the records, a kind of bookkeepers search.As our work so often becomes.Another ironic smile: It is not often as dramatic as is sometimes portrayed.Thats fine.But while youre doing that, what else can we do?What can I do?You can look at the other end of the problem.And I will join you in that.The other end?The motive.But how would you determine that?And having done so, how would you locate it?Doing something like this is so sick that it makes me sick to think about it.Its evil.Evil!Yes, evil!Genette shrugged.Putting that aside, let us presume anyway that it is rare impulse.And so it may leave signs.That someone hates Terminator?That someone is capable of killing worlds?Yes.Its not a common impulse.It may therefore stick out.And besides, it may be a political act, a kind of terrorism or war.It may be meant to convey some message, or force some action.So we can follow it that way.Swan felt her stomach clenching.Damn.I meantheres never been a, a war in space.Weve managed without them.Until now.That gave her pause.For a generation at least there had been warnings from people all over the system that the conflicts between Earth and Mars could lead to war, or that Earths writhing problems were going to drag everyone down with them.Little wars and terrorist attacks and sabotages had never entirely disappeared on poor Earth, and Swan had sometimes thought that diplomats played on the notion that Earths discord might spread, in order to boost their own prestige, their own budgets.Diplomacy as necessary peacemaking in a system on the brinkit had been very convenient for them.But what if it turned out to be true?She said, I guess I thought spacers knew enough to avoid all that.That once we got out here we would do better.Be better.Dont be a fool, the inspector said crisply.Swan gritted her teeth.After an intense struggle for self control she said, But it could be some psychopath.Someone who has lost their mind and is killing just because they can.There are those too, Genette agreed.And if one of them got hold of a qube  But anyone can get a qube!Not at all.Not even everyone in space.They are tracked from the factories, and in theory are all located moment to moment.And whichever one was involved would have to be programmed for this, as I said.It would show in its own records what it had done.Arent there unaffiliateds that are making qubes?Wellmaybe.Probably.So how do we find it, or this person?Or this group?Yes, or nation, or world!Genette shrugged.I want to talk to Wang again, because his qube is really powerful, and he also has the biggest data banks on the unaffiliateds.And also because its possible he was attacked by this same entity.But I admit Im a little afraid to talk to his qube, because were seeing so many signs of qubes acting oddly.As if they have volition now, or in any case are being asked to do things unlike anything theyve done before.Some qubes that weve been monitoring are now exchanging messages in an unprecedented way.You mean theyre entangled with each other?No.That seems to be truly impossible, because of decoherence issues.They use radio communication like anyone else, but the messages are encrypted internally at each end, using superposition as they do.So they are truly encrypted, even when we use our own qubes to try and break the codes.This is the reason why I want to keep these discussions out of the earshot of any and all qubes, for the time being.I dont know which ones to trust.Swan nodded.Youre like Alex in that.Thats right.I used to talk to her about this, and we had the same opinion about this problem.I taught her some procedures to use.So, now I have to think about how to go forward here, and how I can best communicate with Wang and his superqube.Possibly the explanation for all this is even now stored in it, unrecognized because it hasnt been asked to look for it.Because despite all the talk you hear of balkanization, we are still recording the history of the world down to the level of every person and qube.So to find this agent, we only need to read out the history of the solar system for the last several years, and it should be there.Except for the unaffiliateds, Swan pointed out.Well, yes, but Wang has most of them too.But you dont want his recording system to know youre asking, Swan said.In case its the one doing all this.Exactly.Swan never quite stopped feeling sick after that.Someone had meant to kill her cityand yet had missed hitting it directly, thus sparing its citizens, all but the ones who had died in the panic of the evacuation and that poor concert group, killed by the impact.Was that right?She didnt know what to make of thatthat the impact had missed Terminator itself.She ended up talking to Pauline about it.She had an idea that she wanted to check, and Pauline was the best way to do it.There she was, after all, her voice in Swans ear, and always hearing everything Swan said aloud.There was no way she wasnt going to find out all about this, eventually.So: Pauline, do you know what Inspector Genette and I were talking about when I turned you off?No.Can you guess?You might have been talking about the incident at Ygassdril, which you had just seen.This incident resembles the incident at Terminator in some features.If these were deliberate attacks, then whoever initiated them might have used a quantum computer to help them plot trajectories.If Inspector Jean Genette believed that quantum computers were involved, then the inspector might not want any quantum computers to hear details of the investigation.This would be similar to Alexs efforts to keep some of her deliberations completely unwitnessed and unrecorded by any AIs, quantum or digital.The assumption seems to be that if quantum computers are in encrypted radio communication with each other, then they may be plotting activities detrimental to people.Just as she suspected: Pauline could deduce these things.No doubt many other qubes could too, including Genettes own Passepartout, programmed in forensics and detection as it certainly must be.If then, if then, how many trillion times a second?It might resemble their chess playing programs, which had proved themselves to be superhumanly good at that particular game.So it was a little bit futile to turn them off only for certain conversations.Which meant that it was all right for her to say Pauline, if someone had calculated the trajectory of an impactor to hit Terminator smack on and destroy it, but they forgot to include the relativistic precession of Mercury in their calculation and only used the classical calculus of orbital mechanics, how far would they miss by?Assume the impactor was launched from the asteroid belt a year earlier.Try a few different launch points and trajectory courses and times, both with and without the relativity equations for the precession.Pauline said, The precession of Mercury is 5603.24 arc seconds per Julian century, but the portion of that caused by the curvature of space time as described by general relativity is 42.98 arc seconds per century.Any trajectory a year in duration, plotted without that factored in, would therefore miss by 13.39 kilometers.Which is about what happened, Swan said, feeling sick again.Pauline said, Being a precession, the miss should have been to the east of the city, not the west.Oh, Swan said.Well, then She didnt know what to make of it.Pauline said, Ordinary orbital mechanics programs for inner planet transport routes routinely include general relativity as a matter of course.It is not necessary to remember to add the relativity equations.If, however, someone who did not know that tried to program a trajectory for an impact without using open source templates, then they might have added the relativity equations to a situation where they were already being used.And thus, if targeting the city directly, they would create an error of 13.39 kilometers to the west.Ah, Swan said, feeling sicker than ever.She looked for a place to sit down.Terminator was one thing, its people something else: her family, her community.That there could be someone capable of killing them all So But that sounds like a human error.Yes.That evening, late in the galley, she found herself again alone with the inspector, who again was sitting on the table in front of her, eating grapes.Swan said, Since you told me about the pebble mob, Ive been thinking that it was probably aimed directly at Terminator, but that somebody made a mistake.If they didnt know that the relativity equations for the precession of Mercury were already part of the standard algorithms, and added the operation, they would end up hitting just the distance to the west that they did.Interesting, Genette said, looking at her closely.A programming error, in other words.Ive been assuming that it was a deliberate missa warning shot, so to speak.Ill have to think about that.After a moment: You must have asked your Pauline about this?I did.She already had deduced the general topics of what she missed when I turned her off.Im sure your Passepartout is the same.Genette frowned, unable to deny it.Swan said, I cant believe anyone would try to kill so many people.And actually do it, too, in the Yggdrasil.When so much space is available so much everything, really.I mean, were in what people call post scarcity.So I dont get it.You talk about motive, but in a physiological sense, there isnt a motive for stuff like this.I suppose that means that evil really does exist.I thought it was just an old religious term, but I guess I was wrong.Its making me sick.The inspectors attractive little face creased in a slight smile.Sometimes I think its only in post scarcity that evil exists.Before that, it could always be put down to want or fear.It was possible to believe, as apparently you did, that when fear and want went away, bad deeds would too.Humanity would be revealed as some kind of bonobo, an altruistic cooperator, a lover of all.Exactly!Swan cried.Why not!Genette shrugged with a Gallic weariness.Maybe fear and want never went away.We are more than food and drink and shelter.It seems like those should be the crucial determinants, but many a well fed citizen is filled with rage and fear.They feel painted hunger, as the Japanese call it.Painted fear, painted suffering.The rage of the servile will.Will is a matter of free choice, but servitude is lack of freedom.So the servile will feels defiled, feels guilt, expresses that as an assault on something external.And so something evil happens.Another shrug.However you explain it, people do bad things.Believe me.I guess I have to.Please do.Now the inspector was not smiling.I will not burden you with some of the things Ive seen.Ive had to wonder at them, like you are now.The concept of the servile will has helped me.And lately, Ive been wondering if every qube is not by definition some kind of a servile will.But this programming error that might explain the impact hitting west of townthats a human error.Yes.Well, the servile will exists in humans first.So, in parts of themselves people know these acts are bad, but they do them anyway, because in other parts of them some itch gets scratched.But most people try to do good, Swan objected.You see that.Not in my line of work.Swan considered the little figure, so neat and quick.That must change your perspective, she said after a while.It does.And you see the same self justifications, over and over.Its even known which parts of the brain are involved in the justifications.Theyre very near the parts involved with religious feeling, just as you might expect.Not far from the epileptic triggers, and the sense of meaning.Those parts light up like fireworks when one commits evil or justifies it.Think what that means!But everything we do is in the brain somewhere, Swan said.Where in the brain doesnt matter.Genette did not agree.There are patterns in there.Reinforcements.Bad events grow certain parts of the brain bigger.The brain reconfigures to create a spiral of ever more horrible feelings.Further actions follow.So what do we do?Swan exclaimed.You cant make a perfect world and then get decent people, thats backwards, it cant work.The inspector shrugged.Either way seems unlikely to me.Then, after a pause: It can go so wrong.Living in space may be too hard for us.Reduced environments.Ive seen kids raised in Skinner boxeshuman sacrifice  You need your sabbatical, Swan interrupted, not wanting to hear more.She saw suddenly that Genette was looking weary.Usually smalls were hard to read; at first glance they looked rather perfect, like dolls, or innocent, like children.Now she saw the reddened eyes, the blond hair a little oily, the simple ponytail all flyaway with hairs that had broken at the hair tie.And a grimace, very unlike the usual ironic smile.I do need my sabbatical.Im late, in fact, and I hope our investigation will soon get me there.Because Im a little tired.The Mondragon is a beautiful thing, but there are many terraria not in it, some of them seriously deranged.Ultimately what we get by not enforcing a universal law is some kind of accidental libertarian free for all.So were in trouble.This is what Im seeing.When you combine political inadequacy with the physical problems of being in space, it may be too much.We may be trying to make an impossible adaptation out here.So what do we do?she said again.Genette shrugged again.Hold the line, I guess.Maybe we need to understand out here that post scarcity is both heaven and hell at once.They are superposed, like options in a qubit before its wave function collapses.Good and evil, art and war.All there in potentiality.But what do we do?Genette smiled a little at that, shifted and sat cross legged on the table before her, looking like a garden Buddha or Tara, slim and stylized.I want to talk to Wang.Ill figure out how.And to your friend Wahram.Thats much easier.After that it depends on what I learn.Did Alex by chance give you a letter for me too, or for anyone else?No!A raised hand, like the adamantine Buddha: No reason to be annoyed.I just wish she had, thats all.To her this was just a contingency, a backup for something she didnt expect to happen.She probably figured Wang would tell the rest of the group about her plans.And he will, I hope.The next day the inspectors crew had news, and after a conference Genette emerged and said to Swan, Wangs qube identified an asteroid that orbits between Jupiter and Saturn, that drifted outward in its orbit as it would have if it launched the impactor mass at Terminator.The drift happened three years ago, over a period of about six months.Wang took a look through the Saturn League records of ship movements in Saturn space, and those had signals that look like a small ship left this asteroid and from there flew into Saturns upper atmosphere.It might have taken the plunge, but it entered the upper clouds at an angle that means it could have tucked in there, as quite a few ships have.If so, we might be able to track it down.Thats good, Swan said.But this is Wangs qube giving you this lead, yes?Genette shrugged.I know.But the ship track is from the Saturn League, and they tagged it with a transponder on its way down.They also got a read on the transponder already in it, and so they know it was a ship owned by a consortium on Earth.On Earth!Yes.Im not sure what to make of that, but, you knowa pebble mob cant be launched from within an atmosphere.Nor from under a dome or tent.It had to happen on an open surface in the vacuum.So if you were on Earth and wanted to do this, you would have to go into space to do it.I see that.ButEarth?I mean, who on Earth?The inspectors look was so sharp she could not continue.Genette said, There are more than five hundred organizations on Earth that have expressed opposition to the idea of humans in space.But why?They usually point out that Earths problems remain unsolved, and assert that spacers are trying to escape these problems and leave them behind.Often the bodily modifications in spacers are cited as evidence of the beginnings of a forced speciation.Homo sapiens celestis has been suggested as a name for us.Some also call it the speciation of class.Many Terrans have not gotten the longevity treatments.Thus there are claims that space civilization is perverse, wicked, decadent, and horrible.Destabilizing human history itself.Damn it, Swan said.I thought they saw how much good we do them.Please, Genette said.You must take your sabbaticals in very sheltered places.Swan thought about it for a while.So what do we do?I want to go to Saturn and look for this little ship.Passepartout thinks it can predict its location from its entry point.And I can come along?More than welcome.We are already on our way.The Swift Justice ferried them to a passing terrarium called Inner Mongolia, a beautiful innie of big rolling green hills, often interrupted by outcroppings of black rock, and home to herds of wild horses and elusive packs of wolves, an animal Swan particularly loved.The little towns were set on hilltops and looked like collections of fine yurts, often surrounded by lawns, and pools perched on overlooks.Genette brought along only a couple of assistants, and spent a fair amount of time with them working on what Swan assumed were other cases, in a yurt set among a cluster of them on a hilltop.One afternoon after a morning of wandering the grassy hills, trying to spot wolves and failing, Swan came to a hilltop yurt resort that had a broad sloping lawn, a big wading pool and set of steaming baths, and a tent aviary filled with hanging baskets of flowers and many different kinds of hummingbirds, lories, and small colorful finches.The undulating lawn had been manicured until it looked like a green carpet.To Swan this was excessively ornamental, out of tune with the wild hills she had spent the morning on.She passed a pair of women who were laughing as if they also found the place ludicrous, and she said as they passed, Its silly, isnt it.They stopped and one pointed back up the hill.Those three people up there in dresses told us that theyre qubes in android bodies, and didnt we think they could pass as humans.We told them they probably could, but The two women looked at each other and laughed again.But that they were totally blowing it by asking us!Swan spotted the three sitting on the grass near the wading pool.Sounds interesting, she said, and headed up toward them.Pauline, did you hear that?she said on the way up.Yes.All right, well, be quiet, then, and pay attention.It was an old hypothesis, that humans would be comfortable with intelligent robots either when the robots were housed in something like a box, or else when they were simply indistinguishable from humans, at which point they would be just another kind of person.In between these two extremes, however, lay what the hypothesis called the uncanny valleythe zone of like but not like, same but different, which would cause in all humans an instinctive repulsion, disgust, and fear.Thus the hypothesis, plausible enough; but because there had never actually been a robot built in a form human enough to test the near side of the uncanny valley, it had always remained a notion only.Now Swan was perhaps going to get to test the near side of the uncanny valley.The tasteless design sense of this resort seemed to extend to the clothing of these three guests.They sat by themselves in long dresses like Victorian crinolines, looking enough alike to be siblings, or even, yes, cloned androids from a single model.Although one looked slightly more female than the other two.Swan approached them and said, Hello, Im Swan, from Mercury, where we are rebuilding our burned city with the help of many qubes.I understand that you three are claiming that you are qubes, that you are not biologically human?Is that right?The three people sat there staring at her.The one who looked slightly female in body proportions smiled and said, Yes, thats right.Sit down with us and share some tea.Ive got a pot almost ready, gesturing at a little portable stove on the ground, and a little squat red teapot resting over its blue flames.There were cups and spoons and little pots on a blue square cloth next to her.The other two also met her eye and nodded at her.One gestured to the grass beside them.Have a seat, if you want.Thanks, Swan said as she flopped down.Its pretty heavy in here.Where do you all come from?I was made in Vinmara, the most female one said.What about you?Swan asked the other two.I cannot pass a Turing test, one of them replied stiffly.Would you like to play chess?And the three of them laughed.Open mouthsteeth, gums, tongue, inner cheeks, all very human in look and motion.No thanks, Swan said.I want to try a Turing test.Or why dont you test me?How would we do that?How about twenty questions?That means questions that can be answered by yes or no?Thats right.But one could just ask us if the other is a simulacrum or not, and the other answers, and that would take only one question.True.What if we only allow indirect questions?Even so it would be very simple.What if you had to do it without questions at all?But real people ask each other questions all the time.But one of us or more are not real people.And its you who suggested a test.Thats true.All right, let me look at you.Tell me about Inner Mongolia.Dear Inner Mongolia, hollowed in the year  Hollowd be thy name, one of the indeterminates interjected, and they laughed.Population approximately twenty five thousand people, said the more feminine one.You must be a qube, Swan said.No human ever knows that kind of thing.None?Maybe some people, but its odd.But I must say, you look fabulous.Thank you, I decided to wear green today, do you like it?Showing off the sleeve of the dress.Its very nice.Can I look closer?At my dress or at my skin?At your skin, of course.And they all laughed.Laughter, Swan thought as she examined the persons skin.Could robots laugh?She wasnt sure.The persons skin was lightly pocked by hair follicles, slightly lined by creases at the bend points; there was a scattering of nearly transparent hair on the back of the persons wrists and forearms, and a little patch of longer darker hairs on the inside of the wrist, which had four permanent creases just inside the hand, where the skin was thinner but darker, revealing a pair of veins, with bumps and bends in them.The skin on the underside of the hand had faint whorls, like big fingerprints, on the ball of the thumb and the meat of the hand.The lifeline was a deep long curve.It looked very much like anyones hand, anyones skin.If it was artificial skin, it was very impressive; this was said to be the hardest thing to make look natural.If it was a biological skin, as in the labs, but grown over a frame, that would be impressive in a different way.It didnt look possible that these peoples skin could be artificial, but of course materials science was very sophisticated, and many things were possible to it.Set goals and parameters, and what wasnt possible?It remained a question who would want to do such a thing, but on the other hand, people did odd things all the time.And making an artificial human was a very old dream.Maybe it was pointless, but it had a tradition.And here they were, after all, and she wasnt sure yet what she was facing.That in itself was interesting.If you had sex with a machine, was that interesting, or just a complicated form of self satisfaction?Would a qube register your responses to it one way or another?Would it too be having sex?She would have to try it if she wanted to find out.It would be just another approach to the more general problem of qube consciousness.What one had to remember with qubes was that no matter the evidence to the contrary, there was no one home: no consciousness, no Other, just a mechanism programmed to respond to stimuli in a certain fashion by its programmers.No matter how complex the algorithms, they did not add up to a consciousness.Swan fully believed this, but even Pauline fairly often surprised her, so it could be hard not to fall for the illusion.Your skin is beautiful.You feel like flesh of my flesh.Thank you.Do you think, do you think?I most definitely think, the feminine one replied.So you have a sequence of thoughts that wander from one thought to the next in a more or less continuous flow, free associating from one topic to the next, across all the possible thoughts you could have?Im not sure its quite like that.I think its more a matter of stimulus and response, with my thoughts responding to the stimuli of my incoming information.Now, for instance, I think about you and your questions, about the green of my dress as compared to the green of this grass, about what I will eat for dinner, as I am a bit hungry  So you eat food?Yes, we eat food.In fact I have a hard time not eating too much!Me too, Swan said.So, do you ever think about having sex with me?The three of them stared at her.Well, but we have just met, one said.Thats often when people think of it.Really?Im not sure thats true.Believe me, its true.I dont have any good reason to believe you, the second one said.I dont know you well enough for that.Does one ever know one well enough for that?the third one asked.They laughed.Believe someone else?the feminine one said.I dont think so!They laughed again.Maybe they were laughing too much.Are you people on drugs?Swan asked.Is caffeine a drug?Now they were giggling.You three are silly girls, Swan said.Its true, the feminine one admitted.She poured tea from the teapot into four little cups, passed them to the others.The second one opened a hamper and took out biscuits and cakes, handing them around along with small white cloth napkins.They all fell to with an appetite.The three locals ate just like people.Do you swim?Swan asked.Swim, or bathe in hot tubs?I bathe in hot tubes, the third one said, causing the others to cackle muffledly into their napkins.Can we do that?Swan asked.Do you bathe without clothes on?Because that way I could see your whole bodies.And we could see yours!Thats fine.Looks like it would be more than fine, the feminine one murmured, and the others threw back their heads and laughed.Lets do it!the second one exclaimed.I want to finish my tea, the feminine one said primly.Its good.When they were done, the three of them stood up with the grace of dancers and led Swan to the edge of the pool, where a few people were already swimming, some clothed, some bare.There were small children in the shallowest pool, where a fountain of water fell on a rounded little roof and made a water walled refuge.Swans three hosts put down their lunch gear on the deck and then pulled their dresses over their heads and walked over to the water.The feminine one was slight and girlish, and the other two had the willowy bodies of gynandromorphs: slightly wide hips, rounded pecs that were not quite breasts, in between torso to leg ratio and waist to hip ratio, furry genitals that appeared to be mostly female, but with dark masses that might have been small penises and testicles, like Swansone couldnt say more without a further exploration.Although it would prove little, as genitals would be far easier to simulate than hands, being already rubbery.Into the water then.Swan saw that they swam well, almost floated; seemed to have the same specific gravity as human beings.Probably not steel bones, then.Probably not a completely machine interior, covered by a layer of grown flesh and skin.Taking a deep breath floated them, almost, just like it did her.Their eyes tootheir eyes blinked, stared, glanced sidelong, were wet.Could you make every part of a human, put it all together, and have it work?Print up a composite?It seemed unlikely.Nature itself was not that good at it, she thought as her bad knee twinged.To make a simulacrum well, maybe you could focus on just the functional aspects.But wasnt that what brains did too?You silly girls are kind of amazing, Swan said.I cant figure you out.They laughed.No real people would spend all day pretending to a stranger that they were robots, Swan objected.You must be robots.The oddest things are most likely to be true, the second one said.Its a well recognized test in Bible exegesis.They think Jesus probably did curse a fig tree, or else why have the story in there?More laughter.They really were silly girls.Maybe you could make a robot think only up to the level of a twelve year old.But the way they swam.The way they walked.These were hard things to do; or so it seemed.This is weird, she said to herself, pleased.She had thought it was going to be easy.As she walked into a knee deep area of the pool, they stared up at her frankly, as she had stared at them.Ooh, nice legs, the third one said.Nice body.Thank you, Swan said, over the moans of the other two.The feminine one exclaimed, No, thats not all right to say, some people are offended by comments about the aesthetic impacts of their bodies on others!Im not, Swan offered.All right, good then, said the feminine one.I was only being polite, said the third one.You were being forward.You had no idea whether it was polite or not.It was just a compliment.Theres no reason to be overfine about such things.If you stray over limits, people will simply assume you dont know the protocols of their culture but are well intentioned nevertheless.People will, but how do you know this person isnt a simulacrum, sent here to test us?And they laughed till they choked, splashing each other all the while.Swan joined the splashing, then sat in the water and ottered around them for a while.Then she seized the third one to her and kissed it on the mouth.The nondescript kissed back for a second, then pulled away.Hey whats this!I dont know you well enough for this, I dont think!So what?Didnt you like it?And Swan kissed it again, followed its twists away, feeling its tongue be surprised to be touched by another tongue.Pulling away, the nondescript said, Hey!Hey!Hey!Stop!The feminine one had stood up and taken a step toward them, as if to intervene, and Swan turned and pushed her off her feet, so that she splashed hard into the shallow water.What are you doing!the girl cried fearfully, and Swan popped her on the mouth with a left jab.Immediately the girls head flew back and her mouth started to bleed, and she cried out and rushed away.The two nondescripts splashed between her and Swan, blocking Swan from her, shouting at Swan to get back.Swan raised her fists and howled as she pummeled them, and they splashed backward to get away from her, amazed and appalled.Swan stopped following them, and after they climbed out of the pool they stopped and huddled together, looking back at her, the hurt one holding her mouth.Red blood.Swan put her hands on her hips and stared at them.Pretty interesting, she said.But I dont like being fooled.She slogged through the water toward her clothes.She walked back around the cylinder, looking up at a herd of wild horses and kissing her sore knuckles, thinking it over.She wasnt sure what kind of things she had spent the day with.That was strange.When she got back to their hilltop yurts, she waited until Genette and she were again the last two up, and then she said, I ran into a trio of people today who claimed to be artificial people.Androids with qube brains.Genette stared at her.You did?I did.So what did you do?Well, I beat the shit out of them.You did?A little bit, one of them, yes.But she had it coming.Because?Because they were fooling with me.Isnt that kind of like what you do in your abramovics?Not at all.I never fool people, that would be theater.An abramovic is not theater.Well, maybe they werent either, Genette said, frowning.This has to be looked into.There have been reports on Venus and Mars of various incidents like this.Rumors of qube humanoids, sometimes acting oddly.Weve started keeping an eye out.Some of these people have been tagged and are being tracked.So there really are such things?I think so, yes.Weve scanned some, and then of course its obvious.But we dont know much more at this point.But why would anyone do it?Dont know.But if there were qubes that were mobile, and moving around without being noticed, it would explain quite a few things that have happened.So Ill have my team take a look at these people you met.I think they were people, Swan said.They were putting on an act.You think they were real people, pretending to be simulacra?As some kind of theater?Yes.But why?I dont know.Why would a person get in a box and pretend to be a mechanical chess player?Its an old dream.A kind of theater.Maybe.But Im going to look into it anyway, because of these odd things happening.Fine, Swan said.But I think they were people.Anyway, say they werent.Whats the problem with these things, if things they are?The problem is qubes getting out in the world, moving around and doing things.What are they doing?What are they supposed to be doing?Whos making them?And since there is a qube component to the attacks weve seen, we have to wonder, do these things have anything to do with that?Are some of them involved?Hmm, Swan said.Maybe they all come to one question, the inspector said.Why are the qubes changing?Lists (7)  inadvertent frackingfailed sealbad lockbad luckhyperbaric spark firecarbon monoxide buildupcarbon dioxide buildupdesign flawengine

as it seems often to be a matter of squinting hard and waving ones hands in belletristic fashion to make sock puppet myths out of the dense buzzing and blooming confusion of the documented past.Nevertheless, there do seem to be differences in human life between, for instance, the Middle Ages and the Renaissance, or the Enlightenment and the Postmodern; and whether these differences were caused by changes in modes of production, structures of feeling, scientific paradigms, dynastic succession, technological progress, or cultural metamorphosis, it almost doesnt matter.The shapes invoked make a pattern, they tell a story that people can follow.Thus for a long time there was a widely agreed upon periodization schema that included the feudal period and the Renaissance, followed by the Early Modern (seventeenth and eighteenth centuries), the Modern (nineteen and twentieth), and the Postmodern (twentieth and twenty first)after which a new name was most definitely needed.For a long time this need generated competing new systems, and that competition, along with the generally microfine narratology of the historians of the time, combined to foil the invention of any new system that was as universally agreed upon as the old one had been.It was only in the last years of the twenty third century that Charlotte Shortback offered to the historical community her own periodization scheme, for what was by now the long postmodern so endlessly bemoaned at conferences.Hers was partly a joke, she later claimed, but it has become influential since then despite that, or even perhaps because of it.For Shortback, the long postmodern was to be divided like this:  The Dithering: 2005 to 2060.From the end of the postmodern (Charlottes date derived from the UN announcement of climate change) to the fall into crisis.These were wasted years.The Crisis: 2060 to 2130.Disappearance of Arctic summer ice, irreversible permafrost melt and methane release, and unavoidable commitment to major sea rise.In these years all the bad trends converged in perfect storm fashion, leading to a rise in average global temperature of five K, and sea level rise of five metersand as a result, in the 2120s, food shortages, mass riots, catastrophic death on all continents, and an immense spike in the extinction rate of other species.Early lunar bases, scientific stations on Mars.The Turnaround: 2130 to 2160.Verteswandel (Shortbacks famous mutation of values), followed by revolutions; strong AI; self replicating factories; terraforming of Mars begun; fusion power; strong synthetic biology; climate modification efforts, including the disastrous Little Ice Age of 214254; space elevators on Earth and Mars; fast space propulsion; the space diaspora begun; the Mondragon Accord signed.And thus:  The Accelerando: 2160 to 2220.Full application of all the new technological powers, including human longevity increases; terraforming of Mars and subsequent Martian revolution; full diaspora into solar system; hollowing of the terraria; start of the terraforming of Venus; the construction of Terminator; and Mars joining the Mondragon Accord.The Ritard: 2220 to 2270.Reasons for the slowing of the Accelerando are debated, but historians have pointed to the completion of Marss terraforming, its withdrawal from the Mondragon and increasing isolationism, the occupation of all the best terrarium candidates, and the nearly total human entrainment of the solar systems easily available helium, nitrogen, rare earths, fossil fuels, and photosynthesis.It was also becoming clear that the longevity project was encountering problems, and was not completely distributed in any case.Recently some historians have pointed out that this was also the time when quantum computers reached thirty qubits and were combined with petaflop classical computers to make qubestheir point being that qubes have not yet been demonstrated to improve the function of already fast AIs, while the decoherence problems inherent in quantum computing may have helped create conditions for the next period:  The Balkanization: 2270 to 2320.Mars Earth tension, aggression, and cold war for control of the solar system; Mars isolationism; Venus internal strife; decision in the Jovian moons to terraform their big three; proliferation of the unaffiliated terraria, and the disappearance of many populations behind event horizons; influence of qubes; volatile shortages pinching harder, causing hoarding, then tribalism; tragedy of the commons redux; splintering into widespread self sufficient enclave city states.The term hyperbalkanization Shortback considers just an artifact of overheated rhetoric in cultural studies.She has said, however, that a significant prolongation of the Balkanization could perhaps lead to a period worse than the Ritard, or even the Crisisperhaps a time that could be called the Atomization, or the Dissolution.She tells a story about how once in a talk she suggested that the entirety of the last millennium could be called the late feudal period, and afterward a man came up to her and said, What makes you think its late?But what happened in 2312 suggests that the twenty fourth century will mark a turn      IAPETUS  Iapetus looks like a walnut, because it is squashed at the poles, and has a prominent equatorial bulge, both quite visible from space.Why is it squashed at the poles?At one point it was melted and became a big water drop rotating rapidly, its days only seventeen hours long; something passing by set it spinning like a top.It froze while still spinning.So, why the prominent equatorial bulge?No one knows.Some aspect of the freezing of water drop to ice ball, most agree, some kind of surge or excess.But its something saturnologists still argue about.Whatever caused it, the bulge immediately suggested itself as an obvious location for a city, as it could serve as something like a High Street peninsula running all the way around the moon.The city was concentrated at first on the hemisphere facing Saturn, which looms overhead four times larger than Luna from Earth.This was felt worth having in ones sky, especially since Iapetuss orbit is at a seventeen degree tilt from the plane of Saturns rings, giving it a perpetually changing view of the gorgeous mobile.Almost all the other moons see the rings only edge on.From the Iapetus bulge one also has a view down to the rest of the moons surface, twelve or sixteen kilometers lower than the bulge, so there is always a broad icescape below to balance the sublime ringed pearl above.What color the moons surface is depends on where you are looking, because the leading hemisphere of Iapetus is quite black, while the trailing hemisphere is extremely white.This stark discrepancy, noted by Cassini in October of 1671 when he discovered Iapetus, is a result of the moon being tidally locked.
