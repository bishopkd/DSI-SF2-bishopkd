Mom works for the Feds.Feds don't make much money, but they have to work hard, to show their loyalty.Y. T.  goes in and looks at her mother, who has slumped down in her chair, put her hands around her face almost like she's vogueing, put bare stockinged feet up.She wears these awful cheap Fed stockings that are like scouring cloth, and when she walks, her thighs rub together underneath her skirt and make a rasping noise.There is a heavy duty Ziploc bag on the table, full of water that used to be ice a couple of hours ago.Y. T.  looks at Mom's left arm.She has rolled up her sleeve to expose the fresh bruise, just above her elbow, where they put the blood pressure cuff.Weekly Fed polygraph test.Is that you?Mom shouts, not realizing that Y. T.'s in the room.Y. T.  retreats into the kitchen so she won't surprise her mother.Yeah, Mom, she shouts back.How was your day?I'm tired, Mom says.It's what she always says.Y. T.  pinches a beer from the fridge and starts running a hot bath.It makes a roaring sound that relaxes her, like the white noise generator on Mom's nightstand.13  The Nipponese businessman lies cut in segments on The Black Sun's floor.Surprisingly (he looks so real when he's in one piece), no flesh, blood, or organs are visible through the new crossections that Hiro's sword made through his body.He is nothing more than a thin shell of epidermis, an incredibly complex inflatable doll.But the air does not rush out of him, he fails to collapse, and you can look into the aperture of a sword cut and see, instead of bones and meat, the back of the skin on the other side.It breaks the metaphor.The avatar is not acting like a real body.It reminds all The Black Sun's patrons that they are living in a fantasy world.People hate to be reminded of this.When Hiro wrote The Black Sun's sword fighting algorithmscode that was later picked up and adopted by the entire Metaversehe discovered that there was no good way to handle the aftermath.Avatars are not supposed to die.Not supposed to fall apart.The creators of the Metaverse had not been morbid enough to foresee a demand for this kind of thing.But the whole point of a sword fight is to cut someone up and kill them.So Hiro had to kludge something together, in order that the Metaverse would not, over time, become littered with inert, dismembered avatars that never decayed.So the first thing that happens, when someone loses a sword fight, is that his computer gets disconnected from the global network that is the Metaverse.He gets chucked right out of the system.It is the closest simulation of death that the Metaverse can offer, but all it really does is cause the user a lot of annoyance.Furthermore, the user finds that he can't get back into the Metaverse for a few minutes.He can't log back on.This is because his avatar, dismembered, is still in the Metaverse, and it's a rule that your avatar can't exist in two places at once.So the user can't get back in until his avatar has been disposed of.Disposal of hacked up avatars is taken care of by Graveyard Daemons, a new Metaverse feature that Hiro had to invent.They are small lithe persons swathed in black, like ninjas, not even their eyes showing.They are quiet and efficient.Even as Hiro is stepping back from the hacked up body of his former opponent, they are emerging from invisible trapdoors in The Black Sun's floor, climbing up out of the netherworld, converging on the fallen businessman.Within seconds, they have stashed the body parts into black bags.Then they climb back down through their secret trapdoors and vanish into hidden tunnels beneath The Black Sun's floor.A couple of curious patrons try to follow them, try to pry open the trapdoors, but their avatars' fingers find nothing but smooth matte black.The tunnel system is accessible only to the Graveyard Daemons.And, incidentally, to Hiro.But he rarely uses it.The Graveyard Daemons will take the avatar to the Pyre, an eternal, underground bonfire beneath the center of The Black Sun, and burn it.As soon as the flames consume the avatar, it will vanish from the Metaverse, and then its owner will be able to sign on as usual, creating a new avatar to run around in.But, hopefully, he will be more cautious and polite the next time around.Hiro looks up into the circle of applauding, whistling, and cheering avatars and notes that they are fading out.The entire Black Sun now looks like it is being projected on gauze.On the other side of that gauze, bright lights shine through, overwhelming the image.Then it disappears entirely.He peels off his goggles and finds himself standing in the parking lot of the U Stor It, holding a naked katana.The sun has just gone down.A couple of dozen people are standing around him at a great distance, shielding themselves behind parked cars, awaiting his next move.Most of them are pretty scared, but a few of them are just plain excited.Vitaly Chernobyl is standing in the open door of their 20 by 30.His hairdo is backlighted.It has been petrified by means of egg whites and other proteins.These substances refract the light and throw off tiny little spectral fragments, a cluster bombed rainbow.Right now, a miniature image of The Black Sun is being projected onto Vitaly's ass by Hiro's computer.He is rocking unsteadily from foot to foot, as though standing on both of them at the same time is too complicated to deal with this early in the day, and he hasn't decided which one to use.You're blocking me, Hiro says.It's time to go, Vitaly says.You're telling me it's time to go?I've been waiting for you to wake up for an hour.As Hiro approaches, Vitaly watches his sword uncertainly.Vitaly's eyes are dry and red, and on his lower lip he is sporting a chancre the size of a tangerine.Did you win your sword fight?Of course I won the fucking sword fight, Hiro says.I'm the greatest sword fighter in the world.And you wrote the software.Yeah.That, too, Hiro says.After Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns arrived in Long Beach on one of those hijacked ex Soviet refugee freighters, they fanned out across southern California looking for expanses of reinforced concrete that were as vast and barren as the ones they had left behind in Kiev.They weren't homesick.They needed such environments in order to practice their art.The L. A.  River was a natural site.And there were plenty of nice overpasses.All they had to do was follow skateboarders to the secret places they had long since discovered.Thrashers and nuclear fuzz grunge collectives thrive in the same environment.That's where Vitaly and Hiro are going right now.Vitaly has a really old VW Vanagon, the kind with a pop top that turns it into a makeshift camper.He used to live in it, staying on the street or in various Snooze 'n' Cruise franchises, until he met up with Hiro Protagonist.Now, the ownership of the Vanagon is subject to dispute, because Vitaly owes Hiro more money than it is technically worth.So they share it.They drive the Vanagon around to the other side of the U Stor It, honking the horn and flashing the lights in order to shoo a hundred little kids away from the loading dock.It's not a playground, kids.They pick their way down a broad corridor, excusing themselves every inch of the way as they step over little Mayan encampments and Buddhist shrines and white trash stoned on Vertigo, Apple Pie, Fuzzy Buzzy, Narthex, Mustard, and the like.The floor needs sweeping: used syringes, crack vials, charred spoons, pipe stems.There are also many little tubes, about thumb sized, transparent plastic with a red cap on one end.They might be crack vials, but the caps are still on them, and pipeheads wouldn't be so fastidious as to replace the lid on an empty vial.It must be something new Hiro hasn't heard of before, the McDonald's styrofoam burger box of drug containers.They push through a fire door into another section of the U Stor It, which looks the same as the last one (everything looks the same in America, there are no transitions now).Vitaly owns the third locker on the right, a puny 5 by 10 that he is actually using for its intended purpose: storage.Vitaly steps up to the door and commences trying to remember the combination to the padlock, which involves a certain amount of random guessing.Finally, the lock snaps and pops open.Vitaly shoots the bolt and swings the door open, sweeping a clean half circle through the drug paraphernalia.Most of the 5 by 10 is occupied by a couple of large four wheeled flatbed handcarts piled high with speakers and amps.Hiro and Vitaly wheel the carts down to the loading dock, put the stuff into the Vanagon, and then return the empty carts to the 5 by 10.Technically, the carts are community property, but no one believes that.The drive to the scene of the concert is long, made longer by the fact that Vitaly, rejecting the technocentric L. A.  view of the universe in which Speed is God, likes to stay on the surface and drive at about thirty five miles per hour.Traffic is not great, either.So Hiro jacks his computer into the cigarette lighter and goggles into the Metaverse.He is no longer connected to the network by a fiberoptic cable, and so all his communication with the outside world has to take place via radio waves, which are much slower and less reliable.Going into The Black Sun would not be practicalit would look and sound terrible, and the other patrons would look at him as if he were some kind of black and white person.But there's no problem with going into his office, because that's generated within the guts of his computer, which is sitting on his lap; he doesn't need any communication with the outside world for that.He materializes in his office, in his nice little house in the old hacker neighborhood just off the Street.It is all quite Nipponese: tatami mats cover the floor.His desk is a great, ruddy slab of rough sawn mahogany.Silvery cloud light filters through ricepaper walls.A panel in front of him slides open to reveal a garden, complete with babbling brook and steelhead trout jumping out from time to time to grab flies.Technically speaking, the pond should be full of carp, but Hiro is American enough to think of carp as inedible dinosaurs that sit on the bottom and eat sewage.There is something new: A globe about the size of a grapefruit, a perfectly detailed rendition of Planet Earth, hanging in space at arm's length in front of his eyes.Hiro has heard about this but never seen it.It is a piece of CIC software called, simply, Earth.It is the user interface that CIC uses to keep track of every bit of spatial information that it ownsall the maps, weather data, architectural plans, and satellite surveillance stuff.Hiro has been thinking that in a few years, if he does really well in the intel biz, maybe he will make enough money to subscribe to Earth and get this thing in his office.Now it is suddenly here, free of charge.The only explanation he can come up with is that Juanita must have given it to him.But first things first.The Babel/Infocalypse card is still in his avatar's pocket.He takes it out.One of the rice paper panels that make up the walls of his office slides open.On the other side of it, Hiro can see a large, dimly lit room that wasn't there before; apparently Juanita came in and made a major addition to his house as well.A man walks into the office.The Librarian daemon looks like a pleasant, fiftyish, silver haired, bearded man with bright blue eyes, wearing a V neck sweater over a work shirt, with a coarsely woven, tweedy looking wool tie.The tie is loosened, the sleeves pushed up.Even though he's just a piece of software, he has reason to be cheerful; he can move through the nearly infinite stacks of information in the Library with the agility of a spider dancing across a vast web of cross references.The Librarian is the only piece of CIC software that costs even more than Earth; the only thing he can't do is think.Yes, sir, the Librarian says.He is eager without being obnoxiously chipper; he clasps his hands behind his back, rocks forward slightly on the balls of his feet, raises his eyebrows expectantly over his half glasses.Babel's a city in Babylon, right?It was a legendary city, the Librarian says.Babel is a Biblical term for Babylon.The word is Semitic; Bab means gate and El means God, so Babel means Gate of God. 'But it is probably also somewhat onomatopoeic, imitating someone who speaks in an incomprehensible tongue.The Bible is full of puns.They built a tower to Heaven and God knocked it down.This is an anthology of common misconceptions.God did not do anything to the Tower itself.And the LORD said, Behold, they are one people, and they have all one language; and this is only the beginning of what they will do; and nothing that they propose to do will now be impossible for them.Come, let us go down, and there confuse their language, that they may not understand one another's speech.So the LORD scattered them abroad from there over the face of all the earth, and they left off building the city.Therefore its name was called Babel, because there the LORD confused the language of all the earth. 'Genesis 11:69, Revised Standard Version.So the tower wasn't knocked down.It just went on hiatus.Correct.It was not knocked down.But that's bogus.Bogus?Provably false.Juanita believes that nothing is provably true or provably false in the Bible.Because of it's provably false, then the Bible is a lie, and if it's provably true, then the existence of God is proven and there's no room for faith.The Babel story is provably false, because if they built a tower to Heaven and God didn't knock it down, then it would still be around somewhere, or at least a visible remnant of it.In assuming that it was very tall, you are relying on an obsolete reading.The tower is described, literally, as its top with the heavens. 'For many centuries, this was interpreted to mean that its top was so high that it was in the heavens.But in the last century or so, as actual Babylonian ziggurats have been excavated, astrological diagramspictures of the heavenshave been found inscribed into their tops.Oh.Okay, so the real story is that a tower was built with heavenly diagrams carved into its top.Which is far more plausible than a tower that reaches to the heavens.More than plausible, the Librarian reminds him.Such structures have actually been found.Anyway, you're saying that when God got angry and came down on them, the tower itself wasn't affected.But they had to stop building the tower because of an informational disasterthey couldn't talk to each other.Disaster' is an astrological term meaning bad star,' the Librarian points out.Sorrybut due to my internal structure, I'm a sucker for non sequiturs.That's okay, really, Hiro says.You're a pretty decent piece of ware.Who wrote you, anyway?For the most part I write myself, the Librarian says.That is, I have the innate ability to learn from experience.But this ability was originally coded into me by my creator.Who wrote you?Maybe I know him, Hiro says.I know a lot of hackers.I was not coded by a professional hacker, per se, but by a researcher at the Library of Congress who taught himself how to code, the Librarian says.He devoted himself to the common problem of sifting through vast amounts of irrelevant detail in order to find significant gems of information.His name was Dr.Emanuel Lagos.I've heard the name, Hiro says.So he was kind of a meta librarian.That's funny, I guessed he was one of those old CIA spooks who hangs around in the CIC.He never worked with the CIA.Okay.Let's get some work done.Look up every piece of free information in the Library that contains L.  Bob Rife and arrange it in chronological order.The emphasis here is on free.Television and newspapers, yes, sir.One moment, sir, the Librarian says.He turns around and exits on crepe soles.Hiro turns his attention to Earth.The level of detail is fantastic.The resolution, the clarity, just the look of it, tells Hiro, or anyone else who knows computers, that this piece of software is some heavy shit.It's not just continents and oceans.It looks exactly like the earth would look from a point in geosynchronous orbit directly above L. A. , complete with weather systemsvast spinning galaxies of clouds, hovering just above the surface of the globe, casting gray shadows on the oceansand polar ice caps, fading and fragmenting into the sea.Half of the globe is illuminated by sunlight, and half is dark.The terminatorthe line between night and dayhas just swept across L. A.  and is now creeping across the Pacific, off to the west.Everything is going in slow motion.Hiro can see the clouds change shape if he watches them long enough.Looks like a clear night on the East Coast.Something catches his attention, moving rapidly over the surface of the globe.He thinks it must be a gnat.But there are no gnats in the Metaverse.He tries to focus on it.The computer, bouncing low powered lasers off his cornea, senses this change in emphasis, and then Hiro gasps as he seems to plunge downward toward the globe, like a space walking astronaut who has just fallen out of his orbital groove.When he finally gets it under control, he's just a few hundred miles above the earth, looking down at a solid bank of clouds, and he can see the gnat gliding along below him.It's a low flying CIC satellite, swinging north to south in a polar orbit.Your information, sir, the Librarian says.Hiro startles and glances up.Earth swings down and out of his field of view and there is the Librarian, standing in front of the desk, holding out a hypercard.Like any librarian in Reality, this daemon can move around without audible footfalls.Can you make a little more noise when you walk?I'm easily startled, Hiro says.It is done, sir.My apologies.Hiro reaches out for the hypercard.The Librarian takes half a step forward and leans toward him.This time, his foot makes a soft noise on the tatami mat, and Hiro can hear the white noise of his trousers sliding over his leg.Hiro takes the hypercard and looks at it.The front is labeled      He flips the card over.The back is divided into several dozen fingernail sized icons.Some of them are little snapshots of the front pages of newspapers.Many of them are colorful, glowing rectangles: miniature television screens showing live video.That's impossible, Hiro says.I'm sitting in a VW van, okay?I'm jacked in over a cellular link.You couldn't have moved that much video into my system that fast.It was not necessary to move anything, the Librarian says.All existing video on L.  Bob Rife was collected by Dr.Lagos and placed in the Babel/Infocalypse stack, which you have in your system.Oh.14  Hiro stares at the miniature TV in the upper left corner of the card.It zooms toward him until it's about the size of a twelve inch low def television set at arms' length.Then the video image begins to play.It's very poor eight millimeter film footage of a high school football game in the sixties.No soundtrack.What is this game?The Librarian says, Odessa, Texas, 1965.L.  Bob Rife is a fullback, number eight in the dark uniform.This is more detail than I need.Can you summarize some of these things?No.But I can list the contents briefly.The stack contains eleven high school football games.Rife was on the second string Texas all state team in his senior year.Then he proceeded to Rice on an academic scholarship and walked onto the football team, so there are also fourteen tapes of college games.Rife majored in communications.Logically enough, considering what he became.He became a television sports reporter in the Houston market, so there are fifty hours of footage from this periodmostly outtakes, of course.After two years in this line of work, Rife went into business with his great uncle, a financier with roots in the oil business.The stack contains a few newspaper stories to that effect, which, as I note from reading them, are all textually relatedimplying that they came from the same source.A press release.Then there are no stories for five years.He was up to something.Then we begin to see more stories, mostly from the Religion sections of Houston newspapers, detailing Rife's contributions to various organizations.That sounded like summary to me.I thought you couldn't summarize.I can't really.I was quoting a summary that Dr.Lagos made to Juanita Marquez recently, in my presence, when they were reviewing the same data.Go on.Rife contributed $500 to the Highlands Church of the Baptism by Fire, Reverend Wayne Bedford, head minister; $2,500 to the Pentecostal Youth League of Bayside, Reverend Wayne Bedford, president: $150,000 to the Pentecostal Church of the New Trinity, Reverend Wayne Bedford, founder and patriarch; $2.3 million to Rife Bible College, Reverend Wayne Bedford, President and chairman of the theology department; $20 million to the archaeology department of Rife Bible College, plus $45 million to the astronomy department and $100 million to the computer science department.Did these donations take place before hyperinflation?Yes, sir.They were, as the expression goes, real money.That Wayne Bedford guyis this the same Reverend Wayne who runs the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates?The same.Are you telling me that Rife owns the Reverend Wayne?He owns a majority share in Pearigate Associates, which is the multinational that runs the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates chain.Okay, let's keep sifting through this, Hiro says.Hiro peeps out over his goggles to confirm that Vitaly is still nowhere near the concert.Then he dives back in and continues to go over the video and the news stories that Lagos has compiled.During the same years that Rife makes his contributions to the Reverend Wayne, he's showing up with increasing frequency in the business section, first in the local papers and later in The Wall Street Journal and The New York Times.There is a big flurry of publicityobvious PR plantsafter the Nipponese tried to use their old boy network to shut him out of the telecommunications market there, and he took it to the American public, spending $10 million of his own money on a campaign to convince Americans that the Nipponese were duplicitous schemers.A triumphal cover on The Economist after the Nipponese finally knuckled under and let him corner the fiber optics market in that country and, by extension, most of East Asia.Finally, then, the lifestyle pieces start coming in.L.  Bob Rife has let his publicist know that he wants to show a more human side.There is a personality journalism program that does a puff piece on Rife after he buys a new yacht, surplus, from the U. S.  Government.L.  Bob Rife, last of the nineteenth century monopolists, is shown consulting with his decorator in the captain's quarters.It looks nice as it is, considering that Rife bought this ship from the Navy, but it's not Texan enough for him.He wants it gutted and rebuilt.Then, shots of Rife maneuvering his steerlike body through the narrow passages and steep staircase of the ship's interiortypical boring gray steel Navy scape, which, he assures the interviewer, he is going to have spruced up considerably.Y'know, there's a story that when Rockefeller bought himself a yacht, he bought a pretty small one, like a seventy footer or something.Small by the standards of the day.And when someone asked him why he went and bought himself such a dinky little yacht, he just looked at the guy and said, What do you think I am, a Vanderbilt?'Haw!Well, anyway, welcome aboard my yacht.L.  Bob Rife says this while standing on a huge openair platform elevator along with the interviewer and the whole camera crew.The elevator is going up.In the background is the Pacific Ocean.As Rife is speaking the last part of the line, suddenly the elevator rises up to the top and the camera turns around, and we are looking out across the deck of the aircraft carrier Enterprise, formerly of the U. S.  Navy, now the personal yacht of L.  Bob Rife, who beat out both General Jim's Defense System and Admiral Bob's Global Security in a furious bidding war.L.  Bob Rife proceeds to admire the vast, flat open spaces of the carrier's flight deck, likening it to certain parts of Texas.He suggests that it would be amusing to cover part of it with dirt and raise cattle there.Another profile, this one shot for a business network, apparently made somewhat later: Back on the Enterprise, where the captain's office has been massively reworked.L.  Bob Rife, Lord of Bandwidth, is sitting behind his desk, having his mustache waxed.Not in the sense that women have their legs waxed.He's having the curl smoothed out and restored.The waxer is a very short Asian woman who does it so delicately that it doesn't even interfere with his talking, mostly about his efforts to extend his cable TV network throughout Korea and into China and link it up with his big fiber optic trunk line that runs across Siberia and over the Urals.Yeah, you know, a monopolist's work is never done.No such thing as a perfect monopoly.Seems like you can never get that last one tenth of one percent.Isn't the government still strong in Korea?You must have more trouble with regulations there.L.  Bob Rife laughs.Y'know, watching government regulators trying to keep up with the world is my favorite sport.Remember when they busted up Ma Bell?Just barely.The reporter is a woman in her twenties.You know what it was, right?Voice communications monopoly.Right.They were in the same business as me.The information business.Moving phone conversations around on little tiny copper wires, one at a time.Government busted them upat the same time when I was starting cable TV franchises in thirty states.Haw!Can you believe that?It's like if they figured out a way to regulate horses at the same time the Model T and the airplane were being introduced.But a cable TV system isn't the same as a phone system.At that stage it wasn't, cause it was just a local system.But once you get local systems all over the world, all you got to do is hook 'em together and it's a global network.Just as big as the phone system.Except this one carries information ten thousand times faster.It carries images, sound, data, you name it.A naked PR plant, a half hour television commercial with no purpose whatsoever other than to let L.  Bob Rife tell his side of a particular issue.It seems that a number of Rife's programmers, the people who made his systems run, got together and formed a unionunheard of, for hackersand filed a suit against Rife, claiming that he had placed audio and video bugs in their homes, in fact placed all of them under twenty four hour surveillance, and harassed and threatened some programmers who were making what he called unacceptable lifestyle choices.For example, when one of his programmers and her husband engaged in oral sex in their own bedroom one night, the next morning she was called into Rife's office, where he called her a slut and a sodomite and told her to clean out her desk.The bad publicity from this so annoyed Rife that he felt the need to blow a few million on some more PR.I deal in information, he says to the smarmy, toadying pseudojournalist who interviews him.He's sitting in his office in Houston, looking slicker than normal.All television going out to consumers throughout the world goes through me.Most of the information transmitted to and from the CIC database passes through my networks.The Metaversethe entire Streetexists by virtue of a network that I own and control.But that means, if you'll just follow my reasoning for a bit, that when I have a programmer working under me who is working with that information, he is wielding enormous power.Information is going into his brain.And it's staying there.It travels with him when he goes home at night.It gets all tangled up into his dreams, for Christ's sake.He talks to his wife about it.And, goddamn it, he doesn't have any right to that information.If I was running a car factory, I wouldn't let workers drive the cars home or borrow tools.But that's what I do at five o'clock each day, all over the world, when my hackers go home from work.When they used to hang rustlers in the old days, the last thing they would do is piss their pants.That was the ultimate sign, you see, that they had lost control over their own bodies, that they were about to die.See, it's the first function of any organization to control its own sphincters.We're not even doing that.So we're working on refining our management techniques so that we can control that information no matter where it ison our hard disks or even inside the programmers' heads.Now, I can't say more because I got competition to worry about.But it is my fervent hope that in five or ten years, this kind of thing won't even be an issue.A half hour episode of a science news program, this one on the controversial new subject of infoastronomy, the search for radio signals coming from other solar systems.L.  Bob Rife has taken a personal interest in the subject; as various national governments auction off their possessions, he has purchased a string of radio observatories and hooked them together, using his fabled fiber optic net, to turn them into a single giant antenna as big as the whole earth.He is scanning the skies twenty four hours a day, looking for radio waves that mean somethingradio waves carrying information from other civilizations.And why, asks the interviewera celebrity professor from MITwhy would a simple oilman be interested in such a high flown, abstract pursuit?I just about got this planet all sewn up.Rife delivers this line with an incredibly sardonic and contemptuous twang, the exaggerated accent of a cowboy who suspects that some Yankee pencilneck is looking down his nose at him.Another news piece, this one apparently done a few years later.Again we are on the Enterprise, but this time the atmosphere is different again.The top deck has been turned into an open air refugee camp.It is swarming with Bangladeshis that L.  Bob Rife plucked out of the Bay of Bengal after their country washed into the ocean in a series of massive floods, caused by deforestation farther upstream in Indiahydrological warfare.The camera pans to look out over the edge of the flight deck, and down below, we see the first beginnings of the Raft: a relatively small collection of a few hundred boats that have glommed onto the Enterprise, hoping for a free ride across to America.Rife's walking among the people, handing out Bible comics and kisses to little kids.They cluster around with broad smiles, pressing their palms together and bowing.Rife bows back, very awkwardly, but there's no gaiety on his face.He's deadly serious.Mr.Rife, what's your opinion of the people who say you're just doing this as a self aggrandizing publicity stunt?This interviewer is trying to be more of a Bad Cop.Shit, if I took time out to have an opinion about everything, I wouldn't get any work done, L.  Bob Rife says.You should ask these people what they think.You're telling me that this refugee assistance program has nothing to do with your public image?Nope.L  There's an edit and they cut away to the journalist, pontificating into the camera.Rife was on the verge of delivering a sermon, Hiro senses, but they cut him off.But one of the true glories of the Library is that it has so many outtakes.Just because a piece of videotape never got edited into a broadcast program doesn't mean it's devoid of intel value.CIC long ago stuck its fingers into the networks' videotape libraries.All of those outtakesmillions of hours of footagehave not actually been uploaded to the Library in digital form yet.But you can send in a request, and CIC will go and pull that videotape off the shelf for you and play it back.Lagos has already done it.The tape is right there.Nope.Look.The Raft is a media event.But in a much more profound, general sense than you can possibly imagine.Oh.It's created by the media in that without the media, people wouldn't know it was here, Refus wouldn't come out and glom onto it the way they do.And it sustains the media.It creates a lot of information flowmovies, news reportsyou know.So you're creating your own news event to make money off the information flow that it creates?says the journalist, desperately trying to follow.His tone of voice says that this is all a waste of videotape.His weary attitude suggests that this is not the first time Rife has flown off on a bizarre tangent.Partly.But that's only a very crude explanation.It really goes a lot deeper than that.You've probably heard the expression that the Industry feeds off of biomass, like a whale straining krill from the ocean.I've heard the expression, yes.That's my expression.I made it up.An expression like that is just like a virus, you knowit's a piece of informationdatathat spreads from one person to the next.Well, the function of the Raft is to bring more biomass.To renew America.Most countries are static, all they need to do is keep having babies.But America's like this big old clanking, smoking machine that just lumbers across the landscape scooping up and eating everything in sight.Leaves behind a trail of garbage a mile wide.Always needs more fuel.Ever read the story about the labyrinth and the minotaur?Sure.That was on Crete, right?The journalist only answers out of sarcasm; he can't believe he's here listening to this, he wants to fly back to L. A.  yesterday.Yeah.Every year, the Greeks had to pony up a few virgins and send them to Crete as tribute.Then the king put them into the labyrinth, and the minotaur ate them up.I used to read that story when I was a kid and wonder who the hell these guys were, on Crete, that everyone else was so scared of them that they would just meekly give up their children to be eaten, every year.They must have been some mean sons of bitches.Now I have a different perspective on it.America must look, to those poor little buggers down there, about the same as Crete looked to those poor Greek suckers.Except that there's no coercion involved.Those people down there give up their children willingly.Send them into the labyrinth by the millions to be eaten up.The Industry feeds on them and spits back images, sends out movies and TV programs, over my networks, images of wealth and exotic things beyond their wildest dreams, back to those people, and it gives them something to dream about, something to aspire to.And that is the function of the Raft.It's just a big old krill carrier.Finally the journalist gives up on being a journalist, just starts to slag L.  Bob Rife openly.He's had it with this guy.That's disgusting.I can't believe you can think about people that way.Shit, boy, get down off your high horse.Nobody really gets eaten.It's just a figure of speech.They come here, they get decent jobs, find Christ, buy a Weber grill, and live happily ever after.What's wrong with that?Rife is pissed.He's yelling.Behind him, the Bangladeshis are picking up on his emotional vibes and becoming upset themselves.Suddenly, one of them, an incredibly gaunt man with a long drooping mustache, runs in front of the camera and begins to shout: a ma la ge zen ba dam gal nun ka aria su su na an da ...The sounds spread from him to his neighbors, spreading across the flight deck like a wave.Cut, the journalist says, turning into the camera.Just cut.The Babble Brigade has started up again.The soundtrack now consists of a thousand people speaking in tongues under the high pitched, shit eating chuckles of L.  Bob Rife.This is the miracle of tongues, Rife shouts above the tumult.I can understand every word these people are saying.Can you, brother?Yo!Snap out of it, pod!Hiro looks up from the card.No one is in his office except for the Librarian.The image loses focus and veers upward and out of his field of view.Hiro is looking out the windshield of the Vanagon.Someone has just yanked his goggles off his facenot Vitaly.I'm out here, gogglehead!Hiro looks out the window.It's Y. T. , hanging onto the side of the van with one hand, holding his goggles in the other.You spend too much time goggled in, she says.Try a little Reality, man.Where we are going, Hiro says, we're going to get more Reality than I can handle.As Hiro and Vitaly approach the vast freeway overpass where tonight's concert is to take place, the solid ferrous quality of the Vanagon attracts MagnaPoons like a Twinkie draws cockroaches.If they knew that Vitaly Chernobyl himself was in the van, they'd go crazy, they'd stall the van's engine.But right now, they'll poon anything that might be headed toward the concert.When they get closer to the overpass, it becomes a lost cause trying to drive at all, the thrashers are so thick and numerous.It's like putting on crampons and trying to walk through a room full of puppies.They have to nose their way along, tapping the horn, flashing the lights.Finally, they get to the flatbed semi that constitutes the stage for tonight's concert.Next to it is another semi, full of amps and other sound gear.The drivers of the trucks, an oppressed minority of two, have retreated into the cab of the sound truck to smoke cigarettes and glare balefully at the swarm of thrashers, their sworn enemies in the food chain of the highways.They will not voluntarily come out until five in the morning, when the way has been made plain.A couple of the other Meltdowns are standing around smoking cigarettes, holding them between two fingers in the Slavic style, like darts.They stomp the cigarettes out on the concrete with their cheap vinyl shoes, run up to the Vanagon, and begin to haul out the sound equipment.Vitaly puts on goggles, hooks himself into a computer on the sound truck, and begins tuning the system.There's a 3 D model of the overpass already in memory.He has to figure out how to sync the delays on all the different speaker clusters to maximize the number of nasty, clashing echoes.15  The warm up band, Blunt Force Trauma, gets rolling at about 9:00 P. M.  On the first power chord, a whole stack of cheap preowned speakers shorts out; its wires throw sparks into the air, sending an arc of chaos through the massed skateboarders.The sound truck's electronics isolate the bad circuit and shut it off before anything or anyone gets hurt.Blunt Force Trauma play a kind of speed reggae heavily influenced by the antitechnological ideas of the Meltdowns.These guys will probably play for an hour, then there will be a couple of hours of Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns to look forward to.And if Sushi K shows up, he's welcome to make a guest appearance at the mike.Just in case that actually happens, Hiro pulls back from the delirious center of the crowd and begins to orbit back and forth along its fringes.Y. T.'s in there somewhere, but no point in trying to track her down.She would be embarrassed, anyway, to be seen with an oldster like Hiro.Now that the concert is up and running, it will take care of itself.There's not much more for Hiro to do.Besides, interesting things happen along borderstransitionsnot in the middle where everything is the same.There may be something happening along the border of the crowd, back where the lights fade into the shade of the overpass.The fringe crowd looks pretty typical for the wrong side of an L. A.  overpass in the middle of the night.There's a good sized shantytown of hardcore Third World unemployables, plus a scattering of schizophrenic first worlders who have long ago burned their brains to ash in the radiant heat of their own imaginings.A lot of them have emerged from their overturned dumpsters and refrigerator boxes to stand on tiptoe at the edge of the crowd and peer into the noise and light.Some of them look sleepy and awed, and somestocky Latino menlook amused by the whole thing, passing cigarettes back and forth and shaking their heads in disbelief.This is Crips turf.The Crips wanted to provide security, but Hiro, a student of Altamont, decided to take the risk of snubbing them.He hired The Enforcers to do it instead.So every few dozen feet there's a large man with erect posture wearing an acid green windbreaker with ENFORCER spelled out across the back.Very conspicuous, which is how they like it.But it's all done with electropigment, so if there's trouble, these guys can turn themselves black by flipping a lapel switch.And they can make themselves bulletproof just by zipping the windbreakers up the front.Right now, it's a warm night, and most of them are leaving their uniforms open to the cool breezes.Some of them are just coasting, but most of them are attentive, keeping their eyes on the crowd, not the band.Seeing all of those soldiers, Hiro looks for the general and soon finds him: a small, stout black guy, a pint sized weightlifter type.He's wearing the same windbreaker as the others, but there's an additional layer of bulletproof vest underneath, and clipped onto that he's got a nice assortment of communications gear and small, clever devices for hurting people.He's doing a lot of jogging back and forth, swiveling his head from side to side, mumbling quick bursts into his headset like a football coach on the sidelines.Hiro notices a tall man in his late thirties, distinguished goatee, wearing a very nice charcoal gray suit.Hiro can see the diamonds in his tie pin flashing from a hundred feet away.He knows that if he gets up closer he will be able to see the word Crips spelled out in blue sapphires, nestled among those diamonds.He's got his own security detail of half a dozen other guys in suits.Even though they aren't doing security, they couldn't help sending along a token delegation to show the colors.This is a non sequitur that has been nibbling on the edges of Hiro's mind for the last ten minutes: Laser light has a particular kind of gritty intensity, a molecular purity reflecting its origins.Your eye notices this, somehow knows that it's unnatural.It stands out anywhere, but especially under a dirty overpass in the middle of the night.Hiro keeps getting flashes of it in his peripheral vision, keeps glancing over to track down it's source.It's obvious to him, but no one else seems to notice.Someone in this overpass, somewhere, is bouncing a laser beam off Hiro's face.It's annoying.Without being too obvious about it, he changes his course slightly, wanders over to a point downwind of a trash fire that's burning in a steel drum.Now he's standing in the middle of a plume of diluted smoke that he can smell but can't quite see.But the next time the laser darts into his face, it scatters off a million tiny, ashy particulates and reveals itself as a pure geometric line in space, pointing straight back to its source.It's a gargoyle, standing in the dimness next to a shanty.Just in case he's not already conspicuous enough, he's wearing a suit.Hiro starts walking toward him.Gargoyles represent the embarrassing side of the Central Intelligence Corporation.Instead of using laptops, they wear their computers on their bodies, broken up into separate modules that hang on the waist, on the back, on the headset.They serve as human surveillance devices, recording everything that happens around them.Nothing looks stupider; these getups are the modern day equivalent of the slide rule scabbard or the calculator pouch on the belt, marking the user as belonging to a class that is at once above and far below human society.They are a boon to Hiro because they embody the worst stereotype of the CIC stringer.They draw all of the attention.The payoff for this self imposed ostracism is that you can be in the Metaverse all the time, and gather intelligence all the time.The CIC brass can't stand these guys because they upload staggering quantities of useless information to the database, on the off chance that some of it will eventually be useful.It's like writing down the license number of every car you see on your way to work each morning, just in case one of them will be involved in a hit and run accident.Even the CIC database can only hold so much garbage.So, usually, these habitual gargoyles get kicked out of the CIC before too long.This guy hasn't been kicked out yet.And to judge from the quality of his equipmentwhich is very expensivehe's been at it for a while.So he must be pretty good.If so, what's he doing hanging around this place?Hiro Protagonist, the gargoyle says as Hiro finally tracks him down in the darkness beside a shanty.CIC stringer for eleven months.Specializing in the Industry.Former hacker, security guard, pizza deliverer, concert promoter.He sort of mumbles it, not wanting Hiro to waste his time reciting a bunch of known facts.The laser that kept jabbing Hiro in the eye was shot out of this guy's computer, from a peripheral device that sits above his goggles in the middle of his forehead.A long range retinal scanner.If you turn toward him with your eyes open, the laser shoots out, penetrates your iris, tenderest of sphincters, and scans your retina.The results are shot back to CIC, which has a database of several tens of millions of scanned retinas.Within a few seconds, if you're in the database already, the owner finds out who you are.If you're not already in the database, well, you are now.Of course, the user has to have access privileges.And once he gets your identity, he has to have more access privileges to find out personal information about you.This guy, apparently, has a lot of access privileges.A lot more than Hiro.Name's Lagos, the gargoyle says.So this is the guy.Hiro considers asking him what the hell he's doing here.He'd love to take him out for a drink, talk to him about how the Librarian was coded.But he's pissed off.Lagos is being rude to him (gargoyles are rude by definition).You here on the Raven thing?Or just that fuzzgrunge tip you've been working on for the last, uh, thirty six days approximately?Lagos says.Gargoyles are no fun to talk to.They never finish a sentence.They are adrift in a laser drawn world, scanning retinas in all directions, doing background checks on everyone within a thousand yards, seeing everything in visual light, infrared, millimeter wave radar, and ultrasound all at once.You think they're talking to you, but they're actually poring over the credit record of some stranger on the other side of the room, or identifying the make and model of airplanes flying overhead.For all he knows, Lagos is standing there measuring the length of Hiro's cock through his trousers while they pretend to make conversation.You're the guy who's working with Juanita, right?Hiro says.Or she's working with me.Or something like that.She said she wanted me to meet you.For several seconds Lagos is frozen.He's ransacking more data.Hiro wants to throw a bucket of water on him.Makes sense, he says.You're as familiar with the Metaverse as anyone.Freelance hackerthat's exactly right.Exactly right for what?No one wants freelance hackers anymore.The corporate assembly line hackers are suckers for infection.They're going to go down by the thousands, just like Sennacherib's army before the walls of Jerusalem, Lagos says.Infection?Sennacherib?And you can defend yourself in Reality, toothat'll be good if you ever go up against Raven.Remember, his knives are as sharp as a molecule.They'll go through a bulletproof jacket like lingerie.Raven?You'll probably see him tonight.Don't mess with him.Okay, Hiro says.I'll look out for him.That's not what I said, Lagos says.I said, don't mess with him.Why not?It's a dangerous world, Lagos says.Getting more dangerous all the time.So we don't want to upset the balance of terror.Just think about the Cold War.Yup.All Hiro wants to do now is walk away and never see this guy again, but he won't wind up the conversation.You're a hacker.That means you have deep structures to worry about, too.Deep structures?Neurolinguistic pathways in your brain.Remember the first time you learned binary code?Sure.You were forming pathways in your brain.Deep structures.Your nerves grow new connections as you use themthe axons split and push their way between the dividing glial cellsyour bioware self modifiesthe software becomes part of the hardware.So now you're vulnerableall hackers are vulnerableto a nam shub.We have to look out for each other.What's a nam shub?Why am I vulnerable to it?Just don't stare into any bitmaps.Anyone try to show you a raw bitmap lately?Like, in the Metaverse?Interesting.Not to me personally, but now that you mention it, this Brandy came up to my friend  A cult prostitute of Asherah.Trying to spread the disease.Which is synonymous with evil.Sound melodramatic?Not really.You know, to the Mesopotamians, there was no independent concept of evil.Just disease and ill health.Evil was a synonym for disease.So what does that tell you?Hiro walks away, the same way he walks away from psychotic street people who follow him down the street.It tells you that evil is a virus!Lagos calls after him.Don't let the nam shub into your operating system!Juanita's working with this alien?Blunt Force Trauma play for a solid hour, segueing from one song into the next with no chink or crevice in the wall of noise.All a part of the aesthetic.When the music stops, their set is over.For the first time, Hiro can hear the exaltation of the crowd.It's a blast of high pitched noise that he feels in his head, ringing his ears.But there's a low thudding sound, too, like someone pummeling a bass drum, and for a minute he thinks maybe it's a truck rolling by on the overpass above them.But it's too steady for that, it doesn't die away.It's behind him.Other people have noticed it, turned to look toward the sound, are scurrying out of the way.Hiro sidesteps, turning to see what it is.Big and black, to begin with.It does not seem as though such a large man could perch on a motorcycle, even a big chortling Harley like this one.Correction.It's a Harley with some kind of a sidecar added, a sleek black projectile hanging off to the right, supported on its own wheel.But no one is sitting in the sidecar.It does not seem as though a man could be this bulky without being fat.But he's not fat at all, he's wearing tight stretchy clotheslike leather, but not quitethat show bones and muscles, but nothing else.He is riding the Harley so slowly that he would certainly fall over if not for the sidecar.Occasionally he gooses it forward with a flick of the fingers on his clutch hand.Maybe one reason he looks so bigother than the fact that he really is bigis the fact that he appears totally neckless.His head starts out wide and just keeps getting wider until it merges with his shoulders.At first Hiro thinks it must be some kind of avant garde helmet.But when the man rolls past him, this great shroud moves and flutters and Hiro sees that it is just his hair, a thick mane of black hair tossed back over his shoulders, trailing down his back almost to his waist.As he is marveling at this, he realizes that the man has turned his head to look back at him.Or to look in his general direction, anyway.It's impossible to tell exactly what he's looking at because of his goggles, a smooth convex shell over the eyes, interrupted by a narrow horizontal slit.He is looking at Hiro.He gives him the same fuck you smile that he sported earlier tonight, when Hiro was standing in the entryway to The Black Sun, and he was in a public terminal somewhere.This is the guy.Raven.This is the guy that Juanita is looking for.The guy Lagos told him not to mess with.And Hiro has seen him before, outside the entrance to The Black Sun.This is the guy who gave the Snow Crash card to Da5id.The tattoo on his forehead consists of three words, written in block letters: POOR IMPULSE CONTROL.Hiro startles and actually jumps into the air as Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns launch into their opening number, Radiation Burn.It is a tornado of mostly high pitched noise and distortion, like being flung bodily through a wall of fishhooks.These days, most states are franchulates or Burbclaves, much too small to have anything like a jail, or even a judicial system.So when someone does something bad, they try to find quick and dirty punishments, like flogging, confiscation of property, public humiliation, or, in the case of people who have a high potential of going on to hurt others, a warning tattoo on a prominent body part.POOR IMPULSE CONTROL.Apparently, this guy went to such a place and lost his temper real bad.For an instant, a glowing red gridwork is plotted against the side of Raven's face.It rapidly shrinks, all sides converging inward toward the right pupil.Raven shakes his head, turns to look for the source of the laser light, but it's already gone.Lagos has already got his retinal scan.That's why Lagos is here.He's not interested in Hiro or Vitaly Chernobyl.He's interested in Raven.And somehow, Lagos knew that he was going to be here.And Lagos is somewhere nearby, right now, videotaping the guy, probing the contents of his pockets with radar, recording his pulse and respiration.Hiro picks up his personal phone.Y. T. , he says, and it dials Y. T.'s number.It rings for a long time before she picks it up.It's almost impossible to hear anything over the sound of the concert.What the fuck do you want?Y. T. , I'm sorry about this.But something's going on.Something big time.I'm keeping one eye on a big biker named Raven.The problem with you hackers is you never stop working.That's what a hacker is, Hiro says.I'll keep an eye on this Raven guy, too, she says, sometime when I am working.Then she hangs up.16  Raven makes a couple of broad, lazy sweeps along the perimeter of the crowd, going very slowly, looking in all directions.He is annoyingly calm and unhurried.Then he cuts farther out into the darkness, away from the crowd.He does a little more looking around, checking out the perimeter of the shantytown.And finally, he swings the big Harley around in a trajectory that brings him back to the big important Crip.The guy with the sapphire tie clip and the personal security detail.Hiro begins weaving through the crowd in that direction, trying not to be too obvious about it.This looks like it's going to be interesting.As Raven approaches, the bodyguards converge on the head Crip, form a loose protective ring around him.As he comes nearer, all of them back away a step or two, as though the man is surrounded by an invisible force field.He finally comes to a stop, deigns to put his feet on the ground.He flicks a few switches on the handlebars before he steps away from his Harley.Then, anticipating what's next, he stands with his feet apart and his arms up.One Crip approaches from each side.They don't look real happy about this particular duty, they keep casting sidelong glances at the motorcycle.The head Crip keeps goading them forward with his voice, shooing them toward Raven with his hands.Each one of them has a hand held metal detecting wand.They swirl the wands around his body and find nothing at all, not even the tiniest speck of metal, not even coins in his pocket.The man is 100 percent organic.So if nothing else, Lagos's warning about Raven's knife has turned out to be bullshit.These two Crips walk rapidly back to the main group.Raven begins to follow them.But the head Crip takes a step back, holds both of his hands up in a stop motion.Raven stops, stands there, the grin returning to his face.The head Crip turns away and gestures back toward his black BMW.The rear door of the BMW opens up and a man gets out, a younger, smaller black man in round wire rims, wearing jeans and big white athletic shoes and typical studentish gear.The student walks slowly toward Raven, pulling something from his pocket.It's a hand held device, but much too bulky to be a calculator.It's got a keypad on the top and a sort of window on one end, which the student keeps aiming toward Raven.There's an LED read out above the keypad and a red flashing light underneath that.The student is wearing a pair of headphones that are jacked into a socket on the butt of the device.For starters, the student aims the window at the ground, then at the sky, then at Raven, keeping his eye on the flashing red light and the LED readout.It has the feel of some kind of religious rite, accepting digital input from the sky spirit and then the ground spirit and then from the black biker angel.Then he begins to walk slowly toward Raven, one step at a time.Hiro can see the red light flashing intermittently, not following any particular pattern or rhythm.The student gets to within a yard of Raven and then orbits him a couple of times, always keeping the device aimed inward.When he's finished, he steps back briskly, turns, and aims it toward the motorcycle.When the device is aimed at the motorcycle, the red light flashes much more quickly.The student walks up to the head Crip, pulling off his headphones, and has a short conversation with him.The Crip listens to the student but keeps his eyes fixed on Raven, nods his head a few times, finally pats the student on his shoulder and sends him back to the BMW.It was a Geiger counter.Raven strolls up to the big Crip.They shake hands, a standard plain old Euro shake, no fancy variations.It's not a real friendly get together.The Crip has his eyes a little too wide open, Hiro can see the furrows in his brow, everything about his posture and his face screaming out: Get me away from this Martian.Raven goes back to his radioactive hog, releases a few bungee cords, and picks up a metal briefcase.He hands it to the head Crip, and they shake hands again.Then he turns away, walks slowly and calmly back to the motorcycle, gets on, and putt putts away.Hiro would love to stick around and watch some more, but he has the feeling that Lagos has this particular event covered.And besides, he has other business.Two limousines are fighting their way through the crowd, headed for the stage.The limousines stop, and Nipponese people start to climb out.Dark clad, unfunky, they stand around awkwardly in the middle of the party/riot, like a handful of broken nails suspended in a colorful jello mold.Finally, Hiro makes bold enough to go up and look into one of the windows to find out if this is who he thinks it is.Can't see through the smoked glass.He bends down, puts his face right near the window, trying to make it real obvious.Still no response.Finally, he knocks on the window.Silence.He looks up at the entourage.They are all watching him.But when he looks up they glance away, suddenly remember to drag on their cigarettes or rub their eyebrows.There is only one source of light inside the limousine that's bright enough to be visible through the smoked glass, and that is the distinctive inflated rectangle of a television screen.What the hell.This is America, Hiro is half American, and there's no reason to take this politeness thing to an unhealthy extreme.He hauls the door open and looks into the back of the limousine.Sushi K is sitting there wedged in between a couple of other young Nipponese men, programmers on his imageering team.His hairdo is turned off, so it just looks like an orange Afro.He is wearing a partly assembled stage costume, apparently expecting to be performing tonight.Looks like he's taking Hiro up on his offer.He's watching a well known television program called Eye Spy.It is produced by CIC and syndicated through one of the major studios.It is reality television: CIC picks out one of their agents who is involved in a wet operationdoing some actual cloak and dagger workand has him put on a gargoyle rig so that everything he sees and hears is transmitted back to the home base in Langley.This material is then edited into a weekly hour long program.Hiro never watches it.Now that he works for CIC, he finds it kind of annoying.But he hears a lot of gossip about the show, and he knows that tonight they are showing the second to last episode in a five part arc.CIC has smuggled a guy onto the Raft, where he is trying to infiltrate one of its many colorful and sadistic pirate bands: the Bruce Lee organization.Hiro enters the limousine and gets a look at the TV just in time to see Bruce Lee himself, as seen from the point of view of the hapless gargoyle spy, approaching down some dank corridor on a Raft ghost ship.Condensation is dripping from the blade of Bruce Lee's samurai sword.Bruce Lee's men have trapped the spy in an old Korean factory ship in the Core, one of Sushi K's henchmen says, a rapid hissing explanation.They are looking for him now.Suddenly, Bruce Lee is pinioned under a brilliant spotlight that makes his trademark diamond grin flash like the arm of a galaxy.In the middle of the screen, a pair of cross hairs swing into place, centered on Bruce Lee's forehead.Apparently, the spy has decided he must fight his way out of this mess and is bringing some powerful CIC weapons system to bear on Bruce Lee's skull.But then a blur comes in from the side, a mysterious dark shape blocking our view of Bruce Lee.The cross hairs are now centered onwhat, exactly?We'll have to wait until next week to find out.Hiro sits down across from Sushi K and the programmers, next to the television set, so that he can get a TV's eye view of the man.I'm Hiro Protagonist.You got my message, I take it.Fabu!Sushi K cries, using the Nipponese abbreviation of the all purpose Hollywood adjective fabulous.He continues, Hiro san, I am deeply indebted to you for this once in a lifetime chance to perform my small works before such an audience.He says the whole thing in Nipponese except for once in a lifetime chance.I must humbly apologize for arranging the whole thing so hastily and haphazardly, Hiro says.It pains me deeply that you should feel the need to apologize when you have given me an opportunity that any Nipponese rapper would give anything forto perform my humble works before actual homeboys from the ghettos of L. A.   I am profoundly embarrassed to reveal that these fans are not exactly ghetto homeboys, as I must have carelessly led you to believe.They are thrashers.Skateboarders who like both rap music and heavy metal.Ah.This is fine, then, Sushi K says.But his tone of voice suggests that it's not really fine at all.But there are representatives of the Crips here, Hiro says, thinking very, very fast even by his standards, and if your performance is well received, as I'm quite certain it will be, they will spread the word throughout their community.Sushi K rolls down the window.The decibel level quintuples in an instant.He stares at the crowd, five thousand potential market shares, young people with funkiness on their minds.They've never heard any music before that wasn't perfect.It's either studio perfect digital sound from their CD players or performance perfect fuzz grunge from the best people in the business, the groups that have come to L. A.  to make a name for themselves and have actually survived the gladiatorial combat environment of the clubs.Sushi K's face lights up with a combination of joy and terror.Now he actually has to go up there and do it.In front of the seething biomass.Hiro goes out and paves the way for him.That's easy enough.Then he bails.He's done his bit.No point in wasting time on this puny Sushi K thing when Raven is out there, representing a much larger source of income.So he wanders back out toward the periphery.Yo!Dude with the swords, someone says.Hiro turns around, sees a green jacketed Enforcer motioning to him.It's the short, powerful guy with the headset, the guy in charge of the security detail.Squeaky, he says, extending his hand.Hiro, Hiro says, shaking it, and handing over his business card.No particular reason to be coy with these guys.What can I do for you, Squeaky?Squeaky reads the card.He has a kind of exaggerated politeness that is kind of like a military man.He's calm, mature, role modelesque, like a high school football coach.You in charge of this thing?To the extent anyone is.Mr.Protagonist, we got a call a few minutes ago from a friend of yours named Y. T.   What's wrong?Is she okay?Oh, yes, sir, she's just fine.But you know that bug you were talking to earlier?Hiro's never heard the term bug used this way, but he reckons that Squeaky is referring to the gargoyle, Lagos.Yeah.Well, there's a situation involving that gentleman that Y. T.  sort of tipped us off to.We thought you might want to have a look.What's going on?Uh, why don't you come with me.You know, some things are easier to show than to explain verbally.As Squeaky turns, Sushi K's first rap song begins.His voice sounds tight and tense.I'm Sushi K and I'm here to say  I like to rap in a different way    Look out Number One in every city  Sushi K rap has all most pretty    My special talking of remarkable words  Is not the stereotyped bucktooth nerd    My hair is big as a galaxy  Cause I attain greater technology    Hiro follows Squeaky away from the crowd, into the dimly lit area on the edge of the shantytown.Up above them on the overpass embankment, he can dimly make out phosphorescent shapesgreen jacketed Enforcers orbiting some strange attractor.Watch your steep, Squeaky says as they begin to climb up the embankment.It's slippery in places.I like to rap about sweetened romance  My fond ambition is of your pants    So here is of special remarkable way  Of this fellow raps named Sushi K    The Nipponese talking phenomenon  Like samurai sword his sharpened tongue    Who raps the East Asia and the Pacific  Prosperity Sphere, to be specific    It's a typical loose slope of dirt and stones that looks like it would wash away in the first rainfall.Sage and cactus and tumbleweeds here and there, all looking scraggly and half dead from air pollution.It's hard to see anything clearly, because Sushi K is jumping around down below them on the stage, the brilliant orange rays of his sunburst hairdo are sweeping back and forth across the embankment at a speed that seems to be supersonic, washing grainy, gritty light over the weeds and the rocks and throwing everything into weird, discolored, high contrast freeze frames.Sarariman on subway listen  For Sushi K like nuclear fission    Fire breathing lizard Gojiro  He my always big time hero    His mutant rap burn down whole block  Start investing now Sushi K stock    It on Nikkei stock exchange  Waxes; other rappers wane    Best investment, make my day  Corporation Sushi K    Squeaky is walking straight uphill, paralleling a fresh motorcycle track that has cut deeply into the loose yellow soil.It consists of a deep, wide track with a narrower one that runs parallel, a couple of feet to the right.The track gets deeper the farther up they go.Deeper and darker.It looks less and less like a motorcycle rut in loose dirt and more like a drainage ditch for some sinister black effluent.Coming to America now  Rappers trying to start a row    Say Stay in Japan, please, listen!We can't handle competition!U. S.  rappers booing and hissin'  Ask for rap protectionism    They afraid of Sushi K  Cause their audience go away    He got chill financial backin'  Give those U. S.  rappers a smackin'    Sushi K concert machine  Fast efficient super clean    Run like clockwork in a watch  Kick old rappers in the crotch    One of The Enforcers up the hill is carrying a flash light.As he moves, it sweeps across the ground at a flat angle, briefly illuminating the ground like a searchlight.For an instant, the light shines into the motorcycle rut, and Hiro perceives that it has become a river of bright red, oxygenated blood.He learn English total immersion  English/Japanese be mergin'    Into super combination  So can have fans in every nation    Hong Kong they speak English, too  Yearn of rappers just like you    Anglophones who live down under  Sooner later start to wonder    When they get they own rap star  Tired of rappers from afar    Lagos is lying on the ground, sprawled across the tire track.He has been slit open like a salmon, with a single smooth edged cut that begins at his anus and runs up his belly, through the middle of his sternum, all the way up to the point of his jaw.It's not just a superficial slash.It appears to go all the way to his spine in some places.The black nylon straps that hold his computer system to his body have been neatly cut where they cross the midline, and half of the stuff has fallen off into the dust.So I will get big radio traffic  When you look at demographic    Sushi K research statistic  Make big future look ballistic    Speed of Sushi K growth stock  Put U. S.  rappers into shock      17  Jason Breckinridge wears a terracotta blazer.It is the color of Sicily.Jason Breckinridge has never been to Sicily.He may get to go there someday, as a premium.In order to get the free cruise to Sicily, Jason has to accumulate 10,000 Goombata Points.He begins this quest in a favorable position.By opening up his own Nova Sicilia franchise, he started out with an automatic 3,333 points in the Goombata Point bank.Add to that a one time only Citizenship Bonus of 500 points and the balance is starting to look pretty good.The number is stored in the big computer in Brooklyn.Jason grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, one of the most highly franchised regions in the country.He attended the University of Illinois business school, racking up a GPA of 2.9567, and did a senior thesis called The Interaction of the Ethnographic, Financial, and Paramilitary Dimensions of Competition in Certain Markets.This was a case study of turf struggle between Nova Sicilia and Narcolombia franchises in his old neighborhood in Aurora.Enrique Cortazar ran the failing Narcolombia franchise upon which Jason had hinged his argument.Jason interviewed him several times over the phone, briefly, but never saw Mr.Cortazar face to face.Mr.Cortazar celebrated Jason's graduation by fire bombing the Breckinridges' Omni Horizon van in a parking lot and then firing eleven clips of automatic rifle ammunition through the front wall of their house.Fortunately, Mr.Caruso, who ran the local string of Nova Sicilia franchulates that was in the process of beating the pants off of Enrique Cortazar, got wind of these attacks before they happened, probably by intercepting signal intelligence from Mr.Cortazar's fleet of poorly secured cellular phones and CB radios.He was able to warn Jason's family in time, so that when all of those bullets flew through their house in the middle of the night, they were enjoying complimentary champagne in an Old Sicilia Inn five miles down Highway 96.Naturally, when the B school held its end of the year job fair, Jason made a point of swinging by the Nova Sicilia booth to thank Mr.Caruso for saving everyone in his family from certain death.Hey, y'know, it was just, like a neighbor kinda thing, y'know, Jasie boy?Mr.Caruso said, whacking Jason across the shoulder blades and squeezing his deltoids, which were the size of cantaloupes.Jason did not hit the steroids as hard as he had when he was fifteen, but he was still in great shape.Mr.Caruso was from New York.He had one of the most popular booths at the job fair.It was being held in a big exhibition space in the Union.The hall had been done up with an imaginary street pattern.Two highways divided it up into quadrants, and all the franchise companies and nationalities had their booths along the highways.Burbclaves and other companies had booths hidden among the suburban streets within the quadrants.Mr.Caruso's Nova Sicilia booth was right at the intersection of the two highways.Dozens of scrubby B school grads were lined up there waiting to interview, but Mr.Caruso noticed Jason standing in line and went right up and plucked him out of line and grabbed his deltoids.All the other B school grads stared at Jason enviously.That made Jason feel good, really special.That was the feeling he got about Nova Sicilia: personalized attention.Well, I was going to interview here, of course, and at Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong, because I'm real interested in high tech, Jason said, in response to Mr.Caruso's fatherly questioning.Mr.Caruso gave him an especially hard squeeze.His voice said that he was painfully surprised, but that he didn't necessarily think any less of Jason for it, not yet anyway.Hong Kong?What would a smart white kid like you want with a fuckin' Nip operation?Well, technically they're not Nipswhich is short for Niponese, Jason said.Hong Kong is a predominantly Catonese  They're all Nips, Mr.Caruso said, and y'know why I say that?Not because I'm a fuckin' racist, because I'm not.Because to themto those people, y'know, the Nipswe're all foreign devils.That's what they call us.Foreign devils.How d'ya like that?Jason just laughed appreciatively.After all the good things we did for them.But here in America, Jasie boy, we're all foreign devils, ain't we?We all came from someplace'cept for the fuckin' Indians.You ain't gonna interview over at the Lakota Nation, are ya?No, sir, Mr.Caruso, Jason said.Good thinkin'.I agree with that.I'm gettin' away from my main point, which is that since we all have our own unique ethnic and cultural identities, we have to get a job with an organization that uniquely respects and seeks to preserve those distinctive identitiesforging them together into a functionin' whole, y'know?Yes, I see your point, Mr.Caruso, Jason said.By this point, Mr.Caruso had led him some distance away and was strolling with him down one of the metaphorical Highways o' Opportunity.Now, can you think of some business organizations that fill that fuckin' bill, Jasie boy?Well ...Not fuckin' Hong Kong, That's for white people who want to be Japs but can't, didja know that?You don;t wanta be a Jap, do ya?Ha, ha.No, sir, Mr.Caruso.Y'know what I heard?Mr.Caruso let go of Jason, turned, and stood close to him, chest to chest, his cigar zinging past Jason's ear like a flaming arrow as he gesticulated.This was a confidential portion of the chat, a little anecdote between the two men.In Japan, if you screw up?You gotta cut off one a your fingers.Chop.Just like that.Honest to God.You don't believe me?I believe you.But that's not all of Japan, sir.Just in the Yakuza.The Japanese Mafia.Mr.Caruso threw back his head and laughed, put his arm around Jason's shoulders again.Y'know, I like you, Jason, I really do, he said.The Japanese Mafia.Tell me something, Jason, you ever hear anyone describe our thing as The Sicilian Yakuza'?Huh?Jason laughed.No, sir.Y'know why that is?Y'know?Mr.Caruso had come to the serious, meaningful part of his speech.Why is that, sir?Mr.Caruso wheeled Jason around so that both of them were staring down the length of the highway to the tall effigy of Uncle Enzo, standing above the intersection like the Statue of Liberty.Cause there's only one, son.Only one.And you could be a part of it.What?Listen to this!You got a three point grade average!You're gonna kick butt, son!Mr.Caruso, like and other franchisee, had access to Turfnet, the multiple listing service the Nova Sicilia used to keep track of what it called opportunity zones.He took Jason back to the boothright past all of those poor dorks waiting in line, Jason really liked thatand signed onto the network.All Jason had to do was pick out a region.I have an uncle who owns a car dealership in southern California, Jason said, and I know that's a rapidly expanding area, and  Plenty of opportunity zones!Mr.Caruso said, pounding away on the keyboard with a flourish.He wheeled the monitor around to show Jason a map of the L. A.  area blazing with red splotches that represented unclaimed turf sectors.Take your pick, Jasie boy!Now Jason Breckinridge is the manager of Nova Sicilia #5328 in the Valley.He puts on his smart terracotta blazer every morning and drives to work in his Oldsmobile.Lots of young entrepreneurs would be driving BMWs or Acuras, but the organization of which Jason is now a part puts a premium on tradition and family values and does not go in for flashy foreign imports.If an American car is good enough for Uncle Enzo ...Jason's blazer has the Mafia logo embroidered on the breast pocket.A letter G is worked into the logo, signifying Gambino, which is the division that handles accounts for the L. A.  Basin.His name is written underneath: Jason (The Iron Pumper) Breckinridge.That is the nickname that he and Mr.Caruso came up with a year ago at the job fair in Illinois.Everyone gets to have a nickname, it is a tradition and a mark of pride, and they like you to pick something that says something about you.As manager of a local office, Jason's job is to portion work out to local contractors.Every morning, he parks his Oldsmobile out front and goes into the office, ducking quickly into the armored doorway to foil possible Narcolombian snipers.This does not prevent them from taking occasional potshots at the big Uncle Enzo that rises up above the franchise, but those signs can take an amazing amount of abuse before they start looking seedy.Safely inside, Jason signs onto Turfnet.A job list scrolls automatically onto the screen.All Jason has to do is find contractors to handle all of those jobs before he goes home that night, or else he has to take care of them himself.One way or another, they have to get done.The great majority of the jobs are simple deliveries, which he portions out to Kouriers.Then there are collections from delinquent borrowers and from franchisees who depend on Nova Sicilia for their plant security.If it's a first notice, Jason likes to drop by in person, just to show the flag, to emphasize that his organization takes a personal, one to one, hands on, micromanaged approach to debt related issues.If it's a second or third notice, he usually writes a contract with Deadbeaters International, a high impact collection agency with whose work he has always been very happy.Then there is the occasional Code H.  Jason hates to deal with Code Hs, views them as symptoms of a breakdown in the system of mutual trust that makes society work.But usually these are handled directly from the regional level, and all Jason has to do is aftermath management and spin control.This morning, Jason is looking especially crisp, his Oldsmobile freshly waxed and polished.Before he goes inside, he plucks a couple of burger wrappers off the parking lot, snipers be damned.He has heard that Uncle Enzo is in the area, and you never knew when he might pull his fleet of limousines and war wagons into a neighborhood franchise and pop in to shake hands with the rank and file.Yes, Jason is going to be working late tonight, burning the oil until he receives word that Uncle Enzo's plane is safely out of the area.He signs onto Turfnet.A list of jobs scrolls up as usual, not a very long list.Interfranchise activity is way down today, as all the local managers gird, polish, and inspect for the possible arrival of Uncle Enzo.But one of the jobs scrolls up in red letters, a priority job.Priority jobs are a little unusual.A symptom of bad morale and general slipshoddity.Every job should be a priority job.But every so often, there is something that absolutely can't be delayed or screwed up.A local manager like Jason can't order up a priority job; it has to come from a higher echelon.Usually, a priority job is a Code H.  But Jason notes with relief that this one is a simple delivery.Certain documents are to be hand carried from his office to Nova Sicilia #4649, which is south of downtown.Way south.Compton.A war zone, longtime strong hold of Narcolombians and Rastafarian gunslingers.Compton.Why the hell would an office in Compton need a personally signed copy of his financial records?They should be spending all of their time doing Code Hs on the competition, out there.As a matter of fact, there is a very active Young Mafia group on a certain block in Compton that has just succeeded in driving away all of the Narcolombians and turning the whole area into a Mafia Watch neighborhood.Old ladies are walking the streets again.Children are waiting for schoolbuses and playing hopscotch on sidewalks that recently were stained with blood.It's a fine example; if it can be done on this block, it can be done anywhere.As a matter of fact, Uncle Enzo is coming to congratulate them in person.This afternoon.And #4649 is going to be his temporary headquarters.The implications are stunning.Jason has been given a priority job to deliver his records to the very franchise where Uncle Enzo will be taking his espresso this afternoon!Uncle Enzo is interested in him.Mr.Caruso claimed he had connections higher up, but could they really go this high?Jason sits back in his color coordinated earth tone swivel chair to consider the very real possibility that in a few days, he's going to be managing a whole regionor even better.One thing's for surethis is not a delivery to be entrusted to any Kourier, any punk on a skateboard.Jason is going to trundle his Oldsmobile into Compton personally to drop this stuff off.18  He's there an hour ahead of schedule.He was shooting for half an hour early, but once he gets a load of Comptonhe's heard stories about the place, of course, but my Godhe starts driving like a maniac.Cheap, nasty franchises all tend to adopt logos with a lot of bright, hideous yellow in them, and so Alameda Street is clearly marked out before him, a gout of radioactive urine ejected south from the dead center of L. A.  Jason aims himself right down the middle, ignoring lane markings and red lights, and puts the hammer down.Most of the franchises are yellow logoed, wrong side of the tracks operations like Uptown, Narcolombia, Caymans Plus, Metazania, and The Clink.But standing out like rocky islands in this swamp are the Nova Sicilia franchulatesbeachheads for the Mafia's effort to outduel the overwhelmingly strong Narcolombia.Shitty lots that even The Clink wouldn't buy always tend to get picked up by economy minded three ringers who have just shelled out a million yen for a Narcolombia license and who need some real estate, any real estate, that they can throw a fence around and extraterritorialize.These local franchulates send most of their gross to Medelln in franchising fees and keep barely enough to pay overhead.Some of them try to scam, to sneak a few bills into their pocket when they think the security camera isn't watching, and run down the street to the nearest Caymans Plus or The Alps franchulate, which hover in these areas like flies on road kill.But these people rapidly find out that in Narcolombia, just about everything is a capital offense, and there is no judicial system to speak of, just flying justice squads that have the right to blow into your franchulate any time of day or night and fax your records back to the notoriously picky computer in Medelln.Nothing sucks more than being hauled in front of a firing squad against the back wall of the business that you built with your own two hands.Uncle Enzo reckons that with the Mafia's emphasis on loyalty and traditional family values, they can sign up a lot of these entrepreneurs before they become Narcolombian citizens.And that explains the billboards that Jason sees with growing frequency as he drives into Compton.The smiling face of Uncle Enzo seems to beam down from every corner.Typically, he's got his arm around the shoulders of a young wholesome looking black kid, and there's a catch phrase above: THE MAFIAYOU'VE GOT A FRIEND IN THE FAMILY!and RELAXYOU ARE ENTERING A MAFIA WATCH NEIGHBORHOOD!and UNCLE ENZO FORGIVES AND FORGETS.This last one usually accompanies a picture of Uncle Enzo with his arm around some teenager's shoulders, giving him a stern avuncular talking to.It is an allusion to the fact that the Colombians and Jamaicans kill just about everyone.NO WAY, JOS!Uncle Enzo holding up one hand to stop an Uzi toting Hispanic scumbag; behind him stands a pan ethnic phalanx of kids and grannies, resolutely gripping baseball bats and frying pans.Oh, sure, the Narcolombians still have a lock on coca leaves, but now that Nippon Pharmaceuticals has its big cocaine synthesis facility in Mexicali nearly complete, that will cease to be a factor.The Mafia is betting that any smart youngster going into the business these days will take note of these billboards and think twice.Why end up suffocating on your own entrails out in back of some Buy 'n' Fly when you can put on a crisp terracotta blazer instead and become part of a jovial familia?Especially now that they have black, Hispanic, and Asian capos who will respect your cultural identity?In the long term, Jason is bullish on the Mob.His black Oldsmobile is a fucking bullseye in a place like this.It's the worst thing he has ever seen, Compton.Lepers roasting dogs on spits over tubs of flaming kerosene.Street people pushing wheelbarrows piled high with dripping clots of million and billion dollar bills that they have raked up out of storm sewers.Road kills enormous road killsroad kills so big that they could only be human beings, smeared out into chunky swaths a block long.Burning roadblocks across major avenues.No franchises anywhere.The Oldsmobile keeps popping.Jason can't think of what it is until he realizes that people are shooting at him.Good thing he let his uncle talk him into springing for full armor!When he figures that one out, he actually gets psyched.This is the real thing, man!He's driving around in his Olds and the bastards are shooting at him, and it just don't matter!Every street for three blocks around the franchise is blocked off by Mafia war wagons.Men lurk on top of burned tenements carrying six foot long rifles and wearing black windbreakers with MAFIA across the back in five inch fluorescent letters.This is it, man, this is the real shit.Pulling up to the checkpoint, he notes that his Olds is now straddling a portable claymore mine.If he's the wrong guy, it'll turn the car into a steel doughnut.But he's not the wrong guy.He's the right guy.He's got a priority job, a heap of documents on the seat next to him, wrapped up tight and pretty.He rolls the window down and a top echelon Mafia guardsman nails him with the retinal scanner.None of this ID card nonsense.They know who he is in a microsecond.He sits back against his whiplash arrestor, turns the rearview mirror to face himself, checks his hairstyle.It's not half bad.Bud, the guard says, you ain't on the list.Yes, I am, Jason says.This is a priority delivery.Got the papers right here.He hands a hard copy of the Turfnet job order to the guard, who looks at it, grunts, and goes into his war wagon, which is richly festooned with antennas.There is a very, very long wait.A man is approaching on foot, walking across the emptiness between the Mafia franchise and the perimeter.The vacant lot is a wilderness of charred bricks and twisted electrical conduit, but this gentleman is walking across it like Christ on the Sea of Galilee.His suit is perfectly black.So is his hair.He doesn't have any guards with him.The perimeter security is that good.Jason notices that all the guards at this checkpoint are standing a little straighter, adjusting their ties, shooting their cuffs.Jason wants to climb out of his bullet pocked Oldsmobile to show proper respect to whoever this guy is, but he can't get the door open because a big guard is standing right there, using the roof as a mirror.All too quickly, he's there.Is this him?he says to a guard.The guard looks at Jason for a couple of seconds, as though he can't quite believe it, then looks at the important man in the black suit and nods.The man in the black suit nods back, tugs on his cuffs a little bit, squints around him for a few moments, looking at the snipers up on the roofs, looking everywhere but at Jason.Then he steps forward one pace.One of his eyes is made of glass and doesn't point in the same direction as the other one.Jason thinks he's looking elsewhere.But he's looking at Jason with his good eye.Or maybe he isn't.Jason can't tell which eye is the real one.He shudders and stiffens like a puppy in a deep freeze.Jason Breckinridge, the man says.The Iron Pumper, Jason reminds him.Shut up.For the rest of this conversation, you don't say anything.When I tell you what you did wrong, you don't say you're sorry, because I already know you're sorry.And when you drive outta here alive, you don't thank me for being alive.And you don't even say goodbye to me.Jason nods.I don't even want you to nod, that's how much you annoy me.Just freeze and shut up.Okay, here we go.We gave you a priority job this morning.It was real easy.All you had to do was read the fucking job sheet.But you didn't read it.You just took it upon yourself to make the fuckin' delivery on your own.Which the job sheet explicitly tells you not to do.Jason's eyes flick in the direction of the bundle of documents on the seat.That's crap, the man says.We don't want your fucking documents.We don't care about you and your fucking franchise out in the middle a nowhere.All we wanted was the Kourier.The job sheet said that this delivery was supposed to be made by one particular Kourier who works your area, name of Y. T.  Uncle Enzo happens to like Y. T.  He wants to meet her.Now, because you screwed up, Uncle Enzo don't get his wish.Oh, what a terrible outcome.What an embarrassment.What an incredible fuckup, is what it is.It's too late to save your franchise, Jason The Iron Pumper, but it might not be too late to keep the sewer rats from eating your nipples for dinner.19  This wasn't done with a sword, Hiro says.He is beyond astonishment as he stands and stares at Lagos's corpse.All the emotions will probably come piling in on him later, when he goes home and tries to sleep.For now, the thinking part of his brain seems cut loose from his body, as if he has just ingested a great deal of drugs, and he's just as cool as Squeaky.Oh, yeah?How can you tell?Squeaky says.Swords make quick cuts, all the way through.Like, you cut off a head or an arm.A person who's been killed with a sword doesn't look like this.Really?Have you killed a lot of people with swords, Mr.Protagonist?Yes.In the Metaverse.They stand for a while longer, looking at it.This doesn't look like a speed move.This looks like a strength move, Squeaky says.Raven looks strong enough.That he does.But I don't think he was carrying a weapon.The Crips frisked him earlier, and he was clean.Well, then he must have borrowed one, Squeaky says.This bug was all over the place, you know.We were keeping an eye on him, because we were afraid he was going to piss Raven off.He kept going around looking for a vantage point.He's loaded with surveillance gear, Hiro says.The higher he gets, the better it works.So he ended up here on this embankment.And apparently the perpetrator knew where he was.The dust, Hiro says.Watch the lasers.Down below, Sushi K pirouettes spastically as a beer bottle caroms off his forehead.A bundle of lasers sweeps across the embankment, clearly visible in the fine dust being drawn out of it by the wind.This guythis bugwas using lasers.As soon as he came up here  They betrayed his position, Squeaky says.And then Raven came after him.Well, we're not saying it's him, Squeaky says.But I need to know if this characterhe nods at the corpsemight have done anything that would have made Raven feel threatened.What is this, group therapy?Who cares if Raven felt threatened?I do, Squeaky says with great finality.Lagos was just a gargoyle.A big hoover for intel.I don't think he did wet operationsand if he did, he wouldn't do it in that get up.So why do you think Raven was feeling so jumpy?I guess he doesn't like being under surveillance, Hiro says.Yeah.Squeaky says.You should remember that.Then Squeaky puts one hand over his ear, the better to hear voices on his headset radio.Did Y. T.  see this happen?Hiro says.No, Squeaky mumbles, a few seconds later.
