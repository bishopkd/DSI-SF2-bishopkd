Most of the shipboard graffiti concerned improbable sexual geometries between the Second Field Officer and her commander.* * *   From Kaph 35 we jumped to Samk 78, from there to Ayin 129 and finally to Sade 138.Most of the jumps were no more than a few hundred light years, but the last one was 140,000  supposedly the longest collapsar jump ever made by a manned craft.The time spent scooting down the wormhole from one collapsar to the next was always the same, independent of the distance.When Id studied physics, they thought the duration of a collapsar jump was exactly zero.But a couple of centuries later, they did a complicated wave guide experiment that proved the jump actually lasted some small fraction of a nanosecond.Doesnt seem like much, but theyd had to rebuild physics from the foundation up when the collapsar jump was first discovered; they had to tear the whole damned thing down again when they found out it took time to get from A to B.  Physicists were still arguing about it.But we had more pressing problems as we flashed out of Sade 138s collapsar field at three quarters of the speed of light.There was no way to tell immediately whether the Taurans had beat us there.We launched a pre programmed drone that would decelerate at 300 gees and take a preliminary look around.It would warn us if it detected any other ships in the system, or evidence of Tauran activity on any of the collapsars planets.The drone launched, we zipped up in the tanks and the computers put us through a three week evasive maneuver while the ship slowed down.No problems except that three weeks is a hell of a long time to stay frozen in the tank; for a couple of days afterward everybody crept around like aged cripples.If the drone had sent back word that the Taurans were already in the system, we would immediately have stepped down to one gee and started deploying fighters and drones armed with nova bombs.Or we might not have lived that long: sometimes the Taurans could get to a ship only hours after it entered the system.Dying in the tank might not be the most pleasant way to go.It took us a month to get back to within a couple of AUs of Sade 138, where the drone had found a planet that met our requirements.It was an odd planet, slightly smaller than Earth but more dense.It wasnt quite the cryogenic deepfreeze that most portal planets were, both because of heat from its core and because S Doradus, the brightest star in the cloud, was only a third of a light year away.The strangest feature of the planet was its lack of geography.From space it looked like a slightly damaged billiard ball.Our resident physicist, Lieutenant Gim, explained its relatively pristine condition by pointing out that its anomalous, almost cometary orbit probably meant that it had spent most of its life as a rogue planet, drifting alone through interstellar, space.The chances were good that it had never been struck by a large meteor until it wandered into Sade 138s bailiwick and was captured forced to share space with all the other flotsam the collapsar dragged around with it.We left the Masaryk II in orbit (it was capable of landing, but that would restrict its visibility and getaway time) and shuttled building materials down to the surface with the six fighters.It was good to get out of the ship, even though the planet wasnt exactly hospitable.The atmosphere was a thin cold wind of hydrogen and helium, it being too cold even at noon for any other substance to exist as a gas.Noon was when S Doradus was overhead, a tiny, painfully bright spark.The temperature slowly dropped at night, going from twenty five degrees Kelvin down to seventeen degrees  which caused problems, because just before dawn the hydrogen would start to condense out of the air, making everything so slippery that it was useless to do anything other than sit down and wait it out.At dawn a faint pastel rainbow provided the only relief from the black and white monotony of the landscape.The ground was treacherous, covered with little granular chunks of frozen gas that shifted slowly, incessantly in the anemic breeze.You had to walk in a slow waddle to stay on your feet; of the four people who would die during the bases construction, three would be the victims of simple falls.The troops werent happy with my decision to construct the antispacecraft and perimeter defenses before putting up living quarters.That was by the book, though, and they got two days of shipboard rest for every day planetside  which wasnt overly generous, I admit, since ship days were 24 hours long, and a day on the planet was 38.5 hours from dawn to dawn.The base was completed in just less than four weeks, and it was a formidable structure indeed.The perimeter, a circle one kilometer in diameter, was guarded by twenty five gigawatt lasers that would automatically aim and fire within a thousandth of a second.They would react to the motion of any significantly large object between the perimeter and the horizon.Sometimes when the wind was right and the ground damp with hydrogen, the little ice granules would stick together into a loose snowball and begin to roll.They wouldnt roll far.For early protection, before the enemy came over our horizon, the base was in the center of a huge mine field.The buried mines would detonate upon sufficient distortion of their local gravitational fields: a single Tauran would set one off if he came within twenty meters of it; a small spacecraft a kilometer overhead would also detonate it.There were 2800 of them, mostly 100 microton nuclear bombs.Fifty of them were devastatingly powerful tachyon devices.They were all scattered at random in a ring that extended from the limit of the lasers effectiveness, out another five kilometers.Inside the base, we relied on individual lasers, microton grenades, and a tachyon powered repeating rocket launcher that had never been tried in combat, one per platoon.As a last resort, the stasis field was set up beside the living quarters.Inside its opaque gray dome, as well as enough paleolithic weaponry to hold off the Golden Horde, wed stashed a small cruiser, just in case we managed to lose all our spacecraft in the process of winning a battle.Twelve people would be able to get back to Stargate.It didnt do to dwell on the fact that the other survivors would have to sit on their hands until relieved by reinforcements or death.The living quarters and administration facilities were all underground, to protect them from line of sight weapons.It didnt do too much for morale, though; there were waiting lists for every outside detail, no matter how strenuous or risky.I hadnt wanted the troops to go up to the surface in their free time, both because of the danger involved and the administrative headache of constantly checking equipment in and out and keeping track of who was where.Finally I had to relent and allow people to go up for a few hours every week.There was nothing to see except the featureless plain and the sky (which was dominated by S Doradus during the day, and the huge dim oval of the galaxy at night), but that was an improvement over staring at the melted rock walls and ceiling.A favorite sport was to walk out to the perimeter and throw snowballs in front of the laser; see how small a snowball you could throw and still set the weapon off.It seemed to me that the entertainment value of this pastime was about equal to watching a faucet drip, but there was no real harm in it, since the weapons would only fire outward and we had power to spare.For five months things went pretty smoothly.Such administrative problems as we had were similar to those wed encountered on the Masaryk II.And we were in less danger as passive troglodytes than we had been scooting from collapsar to collapsar, at least until the enemy showed up.I looked the other way when Rudkoski reassembled his still.Anything that broke the monotony of garrison duty was welcome, and the chits not only provided booze for the troops but gave them something to gamble with.I only interfered in two ways: nobody could go outside unless they were totally sober, and nobody could sell sexual favors.Maybe that was the Puritan in me, but it was, again, by the book.The opinion of the supporting specialists was split.Lieutenant Wilber, the psychiatric officer, agreed with me; the sex counselors Kajdi and Valdez didnt.But then, they were probably coining money, being the resident professionals.Five months of comfortably boring routine, and then along came Private Graubard.For obvious reasons, no weapons were allowed in the living quarters.The way these people were trained, even a fistfight could be a duel to the death, and tempers were short.A hundred merely normal people would probably have been at each others throats after a week in our caves, but these soldiers had been hand picked for their ability to get along in close confinement.Still there were fights.Graubard had almost killed his ex lover Schon when that worthy made a face at him in the chow line.He had a week of solitary detention (so did Schon, for having precipitated it) and then psychiatric counseling and punitive details.Then I transferred him to the fourth platoon, so he wouldnt be seeing Schon every day.The first time they passed in the halls, Graubard greeted Schon with a karate kick to the throat.Diana had to build him a new trachea.Graubard got a more intensive round of detention, counseling and details  hell, I couldnt transfer him to another company  and then he was a good boy for two weeks.I fiddled their work and chow schedules so the two would never be in the same room together.But they met in a corridor again, and this time it came out more even: Schon got two broken ribs, but Graubard got a ruptured testicle and lost four teeth.If it kept up, I was going to have at least one less mouth to feed.By the Universal Code of Military Justice I could have ordered Graubard executed, since we were technically in a state of combat.Perhaps I should have, then and there.But Charlie suggested a more humanitarian solution, and I accepted it.We didnt have enough room to keep Graubard in solitary detention forever, which seemed to be the only humane yet practical thing to do, but they had plenty of room aboard the Masaryk II, hovering overhead in a stationary orbit.I called Antopol and she agreed to take care of him.I gave her permission to space the bastard if he gave her any trouble.We called a general assembly to explain things, so that the lesson of Graubard wouldnt be lost on anybody.I was just starting to talk, standing on the rock dais with the company sitting in front of me, and the officers and Graubard behind me  when the crazy fool decided to kill me.Like everybody else, Graubard was assigned five hours per week of training inside the stasis field.Under close supervision, the soldiers would practice using their swords and spears and what not on dummy Taurans.Somehow Graubard had managed to smuggle out a weapon, an Indian chakra, which is a circle of metal with a razor keen outer edge.Its a tricky weapon, but once you know how to use it, it can be much more effective than a regular throwing knife.Graubard was an expert.All in a fraction of a second, Graubard disabled the people on either side of him  hitting Charlie in the temple with an elbow while he broke Hilleboes kneecap with a kick  and slid the chakra out of his tunic and spun it toward me in one smooth action.It had covered half the distance to my throat before I reacted.Instinctively I slapped out to deflect it and came within a centimeter of losing four fingers.The razor edge slashed open the top of my palm, but I succeeded in knocking the thing off course.And Graubard was rushing me, teeth bared in an expression I hope I never see again.Maybe he didnt realize that the old queer was really only five years older than he; that the old queer had combat reflexes and three weeks of negative feedback kinesthesia training.At any rate, it was so easy I almost felt sorry for him.His right toe was turning in; I knew he would take one more step and go into a savate leap.I adjusted the distance between us with a short ballestra and, just as both his feet left the ground, gave him an ungentle side kick to the solar plexus.He was unconscious before he hit the ground.But not dead.If Id merely killed him in self defense, my troubles would have been over instead of suddenly being multiplied.A simple psychotic troublemaker a commander can lock up and forget about.But not a failed assassin.And I didnt have to take a poll to know that executing him was not going to improve my relationship with the troops.I realized that Diana was on her knees beside me, trying to pry open my fingers.Check Hilleboe and Moore, I mumbled, and to the troops: Dismissed.5  Dont be an ass, Charlie said.He was holding a damp rag to the bruise on the side of his head.You dont think I have to execute him?Stop twitching!Diana was trying to get the lips of my wound to line up together so she could paint them shut.From the wrist down, the hand felt like a lump of ice.Not by your own hand, you dont.You can detail someone.At random.Charlies right, Diana said.Have everybody draw a slip of paper out of a bowl.I was glad Hilleboe was sound asleep on the other cot.I didnt need her opinion.And if the person so chosen refuses?Punish him and get another, Charlie said.Didnt you learn anything in the can?You cant abrogate your authority by publicly doing a job  that obviously should be detailed.Any other job, sure.But for this  nobody in the company has ever killed.It would look like I was getting somebody else to do my moral dirty work.If its so damned complicated, Diana said, why not just get up in front of the troops and tell them how complicated it is.Then have them draw straws.They arent children.There had been an army in which that sort of thing was done, a strong quasi memory told me.The Marxist POUM militia in the Spanish Civil War, early twentieth.You obeyed an order only after it had been explained in detail; you could refuse if it didnt make sense.Officers and men got drunk together and never saluted or used titles.They lost the war.But the other side didnt have any fun.Finished.Diana set the limp hand in my lap.Dont try to use it for a half hour.When it starts to hurt, you can use it.I inspected the wound closely.The lines dont match up.Not that Im complaining.You shouldnt.By all rights, you ought to have just a stump.And no regeneration facilities this side of Stargate.Stump ought to be at the top of your neck, Charlie said.I dont see why you have any qualms.You should have killed the bastard outright.I know that, goddammit!Both Charlie and Diana jumped at my outburst.Sorry, shit.Look, just let me do the worrying.Why dont you both talk about something else for a while.Diana got up and checked the contents of her medical bag.Ive got another patient to check.Try to keep from exciting each other.Graubard?Charlie asked.Thats right.To make sure he can mount the scaffold without assistance.What if Hilleboe  Shell be out for another half hour.Ill send Jarvil down, just in cage.She hurried out the door.The scaffold I hadnt given that any thought.How the hell are we going to execute him?We cant do it indoors: morale.Firing squad would be pretty grisly.Chuck him out the airlock.You dont owe him any ceremony.Youre probably right.I wasnt thinking about him.I wondered whether Charlie had ever seen the body of a person whod died that way.Maybe we ought to just stuff him into the recycler.Hed wind up there eventually.Charlie laughed.Thats the spirit.Wed have to trim him up a little bit.Doors not very wide.Charlie had a few suggestions as to how to get around that.Jarvil came in and more or less ignored us.Suddenly the infirmary door banged open.A patient on a cart; Diana rushing alongside pressing on the mans chest, while a private pushed.Two other privates were following, but hung back at the door.Over by the wall, she ordered.It was Graubard.Tried to kill himself, Diana said, but that was pretty obvious.Heart stopped.Hed made a noose out of his belt; it was still hanging limply around his neck.There were two big electrodes with rubber handles hanging on the wall.Diana snatched them with one hand while she ripped his tunic open with the other.Get your hands off the cart!She held the electrodes apart, kicked a switch, and pressed them down onto his chest.They made a low hum while his body trembled and flopped.Smell of burning flesh.Diana was shaking her head.Get ready to crack him, she said to Jarvil.Get Doris down here.The body was gurgling, but it was a mechanical sound, like plumbing.She kicked off the power and let the electrodes drop, pulled a ring off her finger and crossed to stick her arms in the sterilizer.Jarvil started to rub an evil smelling fluid over the mans chest.There was a small red mark between the two electrode bums.It took me a moment to recognize what it was.Jarvil wiped it away.I stepped closer and checked Graubards neck.Get out of the way, William, you arent sterile.Diana felt his collarbone, measured down a little ways and made an incision straight down to the bottom of his breastbone.Blood welled out and Jarvil handed her an instrument that looked like big chrome plated bolt cutters.I looked away but couldnt help hearing the thing crunch through his ribs.She asked for retractors and sponges and so on while I wandered back to where Id been sitting.With the corner of my eye I saw her working away inside his thorax, massaging his heart directly.Charlie looked the way.I felt.He called out weakly, Hey, dont knock yourself out, Diana.She didnt answer.Jarvil had wheeled up the artificial heart and was holding out two tubes.Diana picked up a scalpel and I looked away again.He was still dead a half hour later.They turned off the machine and threw a sheet over him.Diana washed the blood off her arms and said, Got to change.Back in a minute.I got up and walked to her billet, next door.Had to know.I raised my hand to knock but it was suddenly hurting like there was a line of fire drawn across it.I rapped with my left and she opened the door immediately.What  oh, you want something for your hand.She was half dressed, unselfconscious.Ask Jarvil.No, thats not it.What happened, Diana?Oh.Well, she pulled a tunic over her head and her voice was muffled.It was my fault, I guess.I left him alone for a minute.And he tried to hang himself.Thats right.She sat on the bed and offered me the chair.I went off to the head and he was dead by the time I got back.Id already sent Jarvil away because I didnt want Hilleboe to be unsupervised for too long.But, Diana  theres no mark on his neck.No bruise, nothing.She shrugged.The hanging didnt kill him.He had a heart attack.Somebody gave him a shot.Right over his heart.She looked at me curiously.I did that, William.Adrenaline.Standard procedure.You get that red dot of expressed blood if you jerk away from the projector while youre getting a shot.Otherwise the medicine goes right through the pores, doesnt leave a mark.He was dead when you gave him the shot?That would be my professional opinion.Deadpan.No heartbeat, pulse, respiration.Very few other disorders show these symptoms.Yeah.I see.Is something  whats the matter, William?Either Id been improbably lucky or Diana was a very good actress.Nothing.Yeah, I better get something for this hand.I opened the door.Saved me a lot of trouble.She looked straight into my eyes.Thats true.Actually, Id traded one kind of trouble for another.Despite the fact that there were several disinterested witnesses to Graubards demise, there was a persistent rumor that Id had Doc Alsever simply exterminate him  since Id botched the job myself and didnt want to go through a troublesome court martial.The fact was that, under the Universal Code of Military Justice, Graubard hadnt deserved any kind of trial at all.All I had to do was say You, you and you.Take this man out and kill him, please.And woe betide the private who refused to carry out the order.My relationship with the troops did improve, in a sense.At least outwardly, they showed more deference to me.But I suspected it was at least partly the cheap kind of respect you might offer any ruffian who had proved himself to be dangerous and volatile.So Killer was my new name.Just when Id gotten used to Old Queer.The base quickly settled back into its routine of training and waiting.I was almost impatient for the Taurans to show up, just to get it over with one way or the other.The troops had adjusted to the situation much better than I had, for obvious reasons.They had specific duties to perform and ample free time for the usual soldierly anodynes to boredom.My duties were more varied but offered little satisfaction, since the problems that percolated up to me were of the the buck stops here type; those with pleasing, unambiguous solutions were taken care of in the lower echelons.Id never cared much for sports or games, but found myself turning to them more and more as a kind of safety valve.For the first time in my life, in these tense, claustrophobic surroundings, I couldnt escape into reading or study.So I fenced, quarterstaff and saber, with the other officers, worked myself to exhaustion on the exercise machines and even kept a jump rope in my office.Most of the other officers played chess, but they could usually beat me  whenever I won it gave me the feeling I was being humored.Word games were difficult because my language was an archaic dialect that they had trouble manipulating.And I lacked the time and talent to master modern English.For a while I let Diana feed me mood altering drugs, but the cumulative effect of them was frightening  I was getting addicted in a way that was at first too subtle to bother me  so I stopped short.Then I tried some systematic psychoanalysis with Lieutenant Wilber.It was impossible.Although he knew all about my problem in an academic kind of way, we didnt speak the same cultural language; his counseling me about love and sex was like me telling a fourteenth century serf how best to get along with his priest and landlord.And that, after all, was the root of my problem.I was sure I could have handled the pressures and frustrations of command; of being cooped up in a cave with these people who at times seemed scarcely less alien than the enemy; even the near certainty that it could lead only to painful death in a worthless cause  if only I could have had Marygay with me.And the feeling got more intense as the months crept by.He got very stern with me at this point and accused me of romanticizing my position.He knew what love was, he said; he had been in love himself.And the sexual polarity of the couple made no difference  all right, I could accept that; that idea had been a clich in my parents generation (though it had run into some predictable resistance in my own).But love, he said, love was a fragile blossom; love was a delicate crystal; love was an unstable reaction with a half life of about eight months.Bullshit, I said, and accused him of wearing cultural blinders; thirty centuries of prewar society taught that love was one thing that could last to the grave and even beyond and if he had been born instead of hatched he would know that without being told!Whereupon he would assume a wry, tolerant expression and reiterate that I was merely a victim of self imposed sexual frustration and romantic delusion.In retrospect, I guess we had a good time arguing with each other.Cure me, he didnt.I did have a new friend who sat in my lap all the time.It was the cat, who had the usual talent for hiding from people who like cats and cleaving unto those who have sinus trouble or just dont like sneaky little animals.We did have something in common, though, since to my knowledge he was the only other heterosexual male mammal within any reasonable distance.Hed been castrated, of course, but that didnt make much difference under the circumstances.6  It was exactly 400 days since the day we had begun construction.I was sitting at my desk not checking out Hilleboes new duty roster.The cat was on my lap, purring loudly even though I refused to pet it.Charlie was stretched out in a chair reading something on the viewer.The phone buzzed and it was the Commodore.Theyre here.What?I said theyre here.A Tauran ship just exited the collapsar field.Velocity .80c.Deceleration thirty gees.Give or take.Charlie was leaning over my desk.What?I dumped the cat.How long?Before you can pursue?I asked.Soon as you get off the phone.I switched off and went over to the logistic computer, which was a twin to the one on Masaryk II and had a direct data link to it.While I tried to get numbers out of the thing, Charlie fiddled with the visual display.The display was a hologram about a meter square by half a meter thick and was programmed to show the positions of Sade 138, our planet, and a few other chunks of rock in the system.There were green and red dots to show the positions of our vessels and the Taurans.The computer said that the minimum time it could take the Taurans to decelerate and get back to this planet would be a little over eleven days.Of course, that would be straight maximum acceleration and deceleration all the way; we could pick them off like flies on a wall.So, like us, theyd mix up their direction of flight and degree of acceleration in a random way.Based on several hundred past records of enemy behavior, the computer was able to give us a probability table:   Days to Contact | Probability  11 | .000001  15 | .001514   20 | .032164   25 | .103287   30 | .676324   35 | .820584   40 | .982685   45 | .993576   50 | .999369  MEDIAN  28.9554 | .500000    Unless, of course, Antopol and her gang of merry pirates managed to make a kill.The chances of that, I had learned in the can, were slightly less than fifty fifty.But whether it took 28.9554 days or two weeks, those of us on the ground had to just sit on our hands and watch.If Antopol was successful, then we wouldnt have to fight until the regular garrison troops replaced us here and we moved on to the next collapsar.Havent left yet.Charlie had the display cranked down to minimum scale; the planet was a white ball the size of a large melon and Masaryk II was a green dot off to the right some eight melons away; you couldnt get both on the screen at the same time.While we were watching a small green dot popped out of the ships dot and drifted away from it.A ghostly number 2 drifted beside it, and a key projected on the displays lower left hand corner identified it as 2  Pursuit Drone.Other numbers in the key identified the Masaryk II, a planetary defense fighter and fourteen planetary defense drones.Those sixteen ships were not yet far enough away from one another to have separate dots.The cat was rubbing against my ankle; I picked it up and stroked it.Tell Hilleboe to call a general assembly.Might as well break it to everyone at once.The men and women didnt take it very well, and I couldnt blame them.We had all expected the Taurans to attack much sooner  and when they persisted in not coming, the feeling grew that Strike Force Command had made a mistake and that theyd never show up at all.I wanted the company to start weapons training in earnest; they hadnt used any high powered weapons in almost two years.So I activated their laser fingers and passed out the grenade and rocket launchers.We couldnt practice inside the base for fear of damaging the external sensors and defensive laser ring.So we turned off half the circle of gigawatt lasers and went out about a klick beyond the perimeter, one platoon at a time, accompanied by either me or Charlie.Rusk kept a close watch on the early warning screens.If anything approached, she would send up a flare, and the platoon would have to get back inside the ring before the unknown came over the horizon, at which time the defensive lasers would come on automatically.Besides knocking out the unknown, they would fry the platoon in less than .02 second.We couldnt spare anything from the base to use as a target, but that turned out to be no problem.The first tachyon rocket we fired scooped out a hole twenty meters long by ten wide by five deep; the rubble gave us a multitude of targets from twice man sized on down.The soldiers were good, a lot better than they had been with the primitive weapons in the stasis field.The best laser practice turned out to be rather like skeetshooting: pair up the people and have one stand behind the other, throwing rocks at random intervals.The one who was shooting had to gauge the rocks trajectory and zap it before it hit the ground.Their eye hand coordination was impressive (maybe the Eugenics Council had done something right).Shooting at rocks down to pebble size, most of them could do better than nine out of ten.Old non bioengineered me could hit maybe seven out of ten, and Id had a good deal more practice than they had.They were equally facile at estimating trajectories with the grenade launcher, which was a more versatile weapon than it had been in the past.Instead of shooting one microton bombs with a standard propulsive charge, it had four different charges and a choice of one , two , three  or four microton bombs.And for really close in fighting, where it was dangerous to use the lasers, the barrel of the launcher would unsnap, and you could load it with a magazine of shotgun rounds.Each shot would send out an expanding cloud of a thousand tiny flechettes that were instant death out to five meters and turned to harmless vapor at six.The tachyon rocket launcher required no skill whatsoever.All you had to do was to be careful no one was standing behind you when you fired it; the backwash from the rocket was dangerous for several meters behind the launching tube.Otherwise, you just lined your target up in the crosshairs and pushed the button.You didnt have to worry about trajectory; the rocket traveled in a straight line for all practical purposes.It reached escape velocity in less than a second.It improved the troops morale to get out and chew up the landscape with their new toys.But the landscape wasnt fighting back.No matter how physically impressive the weapons were, their effectiveness would depend on what the Taurans could throw back.A Greek phalanx must have looked pretty impressive, but it wouldnt do too well against a single man with a flamethrower.And as with any engagement, because of time dilation, there was no way to tell what sort of weaponry they would have.They might have never heard of the stasis field.Or they might be able to say a magic word and make us disappear.I was out with the fourth platoon, burning rocks, when Charlie called and asked me to come back in, urgent.I left Heimoff in charge.Another one?The scale of the holograph display was such that our planet was pea sized, about five centimeters from the X that marked the position of Sade 138.There were forty one red and green dots scattered around the field; the key identified number 41 as Tauran Cruiser.You called Antopol?Yeah.He anticipated the next question.Itll take almost a day for the signal to get there and back.Its never happened before, but of course Charlie knew that.Maybe this collapsar is especially important to them.Likely.So it was almost certain wed be fighting on the ground.Even if Antopol managed to get the first cruiser, she wouldnt have a fifty fifty chance on the second one.Low on drones and fighters.I wouldnt like to be Antopol now.Shell just get it earlier.I dont know.Were in pretty good shape.Save it for the troops, William.He turned down the displays scale to where it showed only two objects: Sade 138 and the new red dot, slowly moving.* * *   We spent the next two weeks watching dots blink out.And if you knew when and where to look, you could go outside and see the real thing happening, a hard bright speck of white light that faded in about a second.In that second, a nova bomb had put out over a million times the power of a gigawatt laser.It made a miniature star half a klick in diameter and as hot as the interior of the sun.Anything it touched it would consume.The radiation from a near miss could botch up a ships electronics beyond repair  two fighters, one of ours and one of theirs, had evidently suffered that fate, silently drifting out of the system at a constant velocity, without power.We had used more powerful nova bombs earlier in the war, but the degenerate matter used to fuel them was unstable in large quantities.The bombs had a tendency to explode while they were still inside the ship.Evidently the Taurans had the same problem  or they had copied the process from us in the first place  because they had also scaled down to nova bombs that used less than a hundred kilograms of degenerate matter.And they deployed them much the same way we did, the warhead separating into dozens of pieces as it approached the target, only one of which was the nova bomb.They would probably have a few bombs left over after they finished off Masaryk II and her retinue of fighters and drones.So it was likely that we were wasting time and energy in weapons practice.The thought did slip by my conscience that I could gather up eleven people and board the fighter we had hidden safe behind the stasis field.It was pre programmed to take us back to Stargate.I even went to the extreme of making a mental list of the eleven, trying to think of eleven people who meant more to me than the rest.Turned out Id be picking six at random.I put the thought away, though.We did have a chance, maybe a damned good one, even against a fully armed cruiser.It wouldnt be easy to get a nova bomb close enough to include us inside its kill radius.Besides, theyd space me for desertion.So why bother?Spirits rose when one of Antopols drones knocked out the first Tauran cruiser.Not counting the ships left behind for planetary defense, she still had eighteen drones and two fighters.They wheeled around to intercept the second cruiser, by then a few lighthours away, still being harassed by fifteen enemy drones.One of the Tauran drones got her.Her ancillary crafts continued the attack, but it was a rout.One fighter and three drones fled the battle at maximum acceleration, looping up over the plane of the ecliptic, and were not pursued.We watched them with morbid interest while the enemy cruiser inched back to do battle with us.The fighter was headed back for Sade 138, to escape.Nobody blamed them.In fact, we sent them a farewell good luck message; they didnt respond, naturally, being zipped up in the tanks.But it would be recorded.It took the enemy five days to get back to the planet and be comfortably ensconced in a stationary orbit on the other side.We settled in for the inevitable first phase of the attack, which would be aerial and totally automated: their drones against our lasers.I put a force of fifty men and women inside the stasis field, in case one of the drones got through.An empty gesture, really; the enemy could just stand by and wait for them to turn off the field, fry them the second it flickered out.Charlie had a weird idea that I almost went for.We could boobytrap the place.What do you mean?I said.This place is boobytrapped, out to twenty five klicks.No, not the mines and such.I mean the base itself, here, underground.Go on.There are two nova bombs in that fighter.He pointed at the stasis field through a couple of hundred meters of rock.We can roll them down here, boobytrap them, then hide everybody in the stasis field and wait.In a way it was tempting.It would relieve me from any responsibility for decision making, leave everything up to chance.I dont think it would work, Charlie.He seemed hurt.Sure it would.No, look.For it to work, you have to get every single Tauran inside the kill radius before it goes off  but they wouldnt all come charging in here once they breached our defenses.Least of all if the place seemed deserted.Theyd suspect something, send in an advance party.And after the advance party set off the bombs  Wed be back where we started, yeah.Minus the base.Sorry.I shrugged.It was an idea.Keep thinking, Charlie.I turned my attention back to the display, where the lopsided space war was in progress.Logically enough, the enemy wanted to knock out that one fighter overhead before he started to work on us.About all we could do was watch the red dots crawl around the planet and try to score.So far the pilot had managed to knock out all the drones; the enemy hadnt sent any fighters after him yet.Id given the pilot control over five of the lasers in our defensive ring.They couldnt do much good, though.A gigawatt laser pumps out a billion kilowatts per second at a range of a hundred meters.A thousand klicks up, though, the beam was attenuated to ten kilowatts.Might do some damage if it hit an optical sensor.At least confuse things.We could use another fighter.Or six.Use up the drones, I said.We did have a fighter, of course, and a swabbie attached to us who could pilot it.It might turn out to be our only hope, if they got us cornered in the stasis field.How far away is the other guy?Charlie asked, meaning the fighter pilot who had turned tail.I cranked down the scale, and the green dot appeared at the right of the display.About six light hours.He had two drones left, too near to him to show as separate dots, having expended one in covering his getaway.Hes not accelerating any more, but hes doing point nine gee.Couldnt do us any good if he wanted to.Need almost a month to slow down.At that low point, the light that stood for our own defensive fighter faded out.Shit.Now the fun starts.Should I tell the troops to get ready, stand by to go topside?No  have them suit up, in case we lose air.But I expect itll be a little while before we have a ground attack.I turned the scale up again.Four red dots were already creeping around the globe toward us.I got suited up and came back to Administration to watch the fireworks on the monitors.The lasers worked perfectly.All four drones converged on us simultaneously; were targeted and destroyed.All but one of the nova bombs went off below our horizon (the visual horizon was about ten kilometers away, but the lasers were mounted high and could target something at twice that distance).The bomb that detonated on our horizon had melted out a semicircular chunk that glowed brilliantly white for several minutes.An hour later, it was still glowing dull orange, and the ground temperature outside had risen to fifty degrees Absolute, melting most of our snow, exposing an irregular dark gray surface.The next attack was also over in a fraction of a second, but this time there had been eight drones, and four of them got within ten klicks.Radiation from the glowing craters raised the temperature to nearly 300 degrees.That was above the melting point of water, and I was starting to get worried.The fighting suits were good to over a thousand degrees, but the automatic lasers depended on low temperature superconductors for their speed.I asked the computer what the lasers temperature limit was, and it printed out TR 398 734 009 265, Some Aspects Concerning the Adaptability of Cryogenic Ordnance to Use in Relatively High Temperature Environments, which had lots of handy advice about how we could insulate the weapons if we had access to a fully equipped armorers shop.It did note that the response time of automatic aiming devices increased as the temperature increased, and that above some critical temperature, the weapons would not aim at all.But there was no way to predict any individual weapons behavior, other than to note that the highest critical temperature recorded was 790 degrees and the lowest was 420 degrees.Charlie was watching the display.His voice was flat over the suits radio.Sixteen this time.Surprised?One of the few things we knew about Tauran psychology was a certain compulsiveness about numbers, especially primes and powers of two.Lets just hope they dont have 32 left.I queried the computer on this; all it could say was that the cruiser had thus far launched a total of 44 drones and that some cruisers had been known to carry as many as 128:  We had more than a half hour before the drones would strike.I could evacuate everybody to the stasis field, and they would be temporarily safe if one of the nova bombs got through.Safe, but trapped.How long would it take the crater to cool down, if three or four  let alone sixteen  of the bombs made it through?You couldnt live forever in a fighting suit, even though it recycled everything with remorseless efficiency.One week was enough to make you thoroughly miserable.Two weeks, suicidal.Nobody had ever gone three weeks, under field conditions.Besides, as a defensive position, the stasis field could be a deathtrap.The enemy has all the options since the dome is opaque; the only way you can find out what theyre up to is to stick your head out.They didnt have to wade in with primitive weapons unless they were impatient.They could keep the dome saturated with laser fire and wait for you to turn off the generator.Meanwhile harassing you by throwing spears, rocks, arrows into the dome  you could return fire, but it was pretty futile.Of course, if one man stayed inside the base, the others could wait out the next half hour in the stasis field.If he didnt come get them, theyd know the outside was hot.I chinned the combination that would give me a frequency available to everybody echelon 5 and above.This is Major Mandella.That still sounded like a bad joke.I outlined the situation to them and asked them to tell their troops that everyone in the company was free to move into the stasis field.I would stay behind and come retrieve them if things went well  not out of nobility, of course; I preferred taking the chance of being vaporized in a nanosecond, rather than almost certain slow death under the gray dome.I chinned Charlies frequency.You can go, too.Ill take care of things here.No, thanks, he said slowly.Id just as soon  Hey, look at this.The cruiser had launched another red dot, a couple of minutes behind the others.The displays key identified it as being another drone.Thats curious.Superstitious bastards, he said without feeling.It turned out that only eleven people chose to join the fifty who had been ordered into the dome.That shouldnt have surprised me, but it did.As the drones approached, Charlie and I stared at the monitors, carefully not looking at the holograph display, tacitly agreeing that it would be better not to know when they were one minute away, thirty seconds  And then, like the other times, it was over before we knew it had started.The screens glared white and there was a yowl of static, and we were still alive.But this time there were fifteen new holes on the horizon  or closer and the temperature was rising so fast that the last digit in the readout was an amorphous blur.The number peaked in the high 800s and began to slide back down.We had never seen any of the drones, not during that tiny fraction of a second it took the lasers to aim and fire.But then the seventeenth one flashed over the horizon, zigzagging crazily, and stopped directly overhead.For an instant it seemed to hover, and then it began to fall.Half the lasers had detected it, and they were firing steadily, but none of them could aim; they were all stuck in their last firing position.It glittered as it dropped, the mirror polish of its sleek hull reflecting the white glow from the craters and the eerie flickering of the constant, impotent laser fire.I heard Charlie take one deep breath, and the drone fell so close you could see spidery Tauran numerals etched on the hull and a transparent porthole near the tip  then its engine flared and it was suddenly gone.What the hell?Charlie said, quietly.The porthole.Maybe reconnaissance.I guess.So we cant touch them, and they know it.Unless the lasers recover.Didnt seem likely.We better get everybody under the dome.Us, too.He said a word whose vowel had changed over the centuries, but whose meaning was clear.No hurry.Lets see what they do.We waited for several hours.The temperature outside stabilized at 690 degrees  just under the melting point of zinc, I remembered to no purpose  and I tried the manual controls for the lasers, but they were still frozen.Here they come, Charlie said.Eight again.I started for the display.Guess well  Wait!They arent drones.The key identified all eight with the legend Troop Carrier.Guess they want to take the base, he said.Intact.That, and maybe try out new weapons and techniques.Its not much of a risk for them.They can always retreat and drop a nova bomb in our laps.I called Brill and had her go get everybody who was in the stasis field, set them up with the remainder of her platoon as a defensive fine circling around the northeast and northwest quadrants.Id put the rest of the people on the other half circle.I wonder, Charlie said.Maybe we shouldnt put everyone topside at once.Until we know how many Taurans there are.That was a point.Keep a reserve, let the enemy underestimate our strength.Its an idea  There might be just 64 of them in eight carriers.Or 128 or 256.I wished our spy satellites had a finer sense of discrimination.But you can only cram so much into a machine the size of a grape.I decided to let Brills seventy people be our first line of defense and ordered them into a ring in the ditches we had made outside the bases perimeter.Everybody else would stay downstairs until needed.If it turned out that the Taurans, either through numbers or new technology, could field an unstoppable force, Id order everyone into the stasis field.There was a tunnel from the living quarters to the dome, so the people underground could go straight there in safety.The ones in the ditches would have to fall back under fire.If any of them were still alive when I gave the order.I called in Hilleboe and had her and Charlie keep watch over the lasers.If they came unstuck, Id call Brill and her people back.Turn on the automatic aiming system again, then sit back and watch the show.But even stuck, the lasers could be useful.Charlie marked the monitors to show where the rays would go; he and Hilleboe could fire them manually whenever something moved into a weapons line of sight.We had about twenty minutes.Brill was walking around the perimeter with her men and women, ordering them into the ditches a squad at a time, setting up overlapping fields of fire.I broke in and asked her to set up the heavy weapons so that they could be used to channel the enemys advance into the path of the lasers.There wasnt much else to do but wait.I asked Charlie to measure the enemys progress and try to give us an accurate count down, then sat at my desk and pulled out a pad, to diagram Brills arrangement and see whether I could improve on it.The cat jumped up on my lap, mewling piteously.Hed evidently been unable to tell one person from the other, suited up.But nobody else ever sat at this desk.I reached up to pet him and he jumped away.The first line that I drew ripped through four sheets of paper.
