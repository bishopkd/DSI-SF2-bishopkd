"Yes!""But I'm already saturated with spice," he said."Every moment is a vision. "He gestured with a bare foot at the bowl."Pour that onto the sand.Who'll know?""They watch," she whispered.He shook his head, shedding her from his visions, feeling new freedom envelop him.No need to kill this poor pawn.She danced to other music, not even knowing the steps, believing that she might yet share the power which lured the hungry pirates of Shuloch and Jacurutu.Leto went to the doorseal, put a hand upon it."When Muriz comes," she said, "he'll be very angry with  "  "Muriz is a merchant of emptiness," Leto said."My aunt has drained him. "She got to her feet."I'm going out with you. "And he thought: She remembers how I escaped her.Now she feels the fragility of her hold upon me.Her visions stir within her.But she would not listen to those visions.She had but to reflect: How could he outwit a captive worm in its narrow canyon?How could he live in the Tanzerouft without stillsuit or Fremkit?"I must be alone to consult my visions," he said."You'll remain here. ""Where will you go?""To the qanat. ""The sandtrout come out in swarms at night. ""They won't eat me. ""Sometimes the worm comes down to just beyond the water," she said."If you cross the qanat... "She broke off, trying to edge her words with menace."How could I mount a worm without hooks?"he asked, wondering if she still could salvage some bit of her visions."Will you eat when you return?"she asked, squatting once more by the bowl recovering the ladle and stirring the indigo broth."Everything in its own time," he said, knowing she'd be unable to detect his delicate use of Voice, the way he insinuated his own desires into her decision making."Muriz will come and see if you've had a vision," she warned."I will deal with Muriz in my own way," he said, noting how heavy and slow her movements had become.The pattern of all Fremen lent itself naturally into the way he guided her now.Fremen were people of extraordinary energy at sunrise but a deep and lethargic melancholy often overcame them at nightfall.Already she wanted to sink into sleep and dreams.Leto let himself out into the night alone.The sky glittered with stars and he could make out the bulk of surrounding butte against their pattern.He went up under the palms to the qanat.For a long time Leto squatted at the qanat's edge, listening to the restless hiss of sand within the canyon beyond.A small worm by the sound of it; chosen for that reason, no doubt.A small worm would be easier to transport.He thought about the worm's capture: the hunters would dull it with a water mist, using the traditional Fremen method of taking a worm for the orgy/transformation rite.But this worm would not be killed by immersion.This one would go out on a Guild heighliner to some hopeful buyer whose desert probably would be too moist.Few off worlders realized the basic desiccation which the sandtrout had maintained on Arrakis.Had maintained.Because even here in the Tanzerouft there would be many times more airborne moisture than any worm had ever before known short of its death in a Fremen cistern.He heard Sabiha stirring in the hut behind him.She was restless, prodded by her own suppressed visions.He wondered how it would be to live outside a vision with her, sharing each moment just as it came, of itself.The thought attracted him far more strongly than had any spice vision.There was a certain cleanliness about facing an unknown future."A kiss in the sietch is worth two in the city. "The old Fremen maxim said it all.The traditional sietch had held a recognizable wildness mingled with shyness.There were traces of that shyness in the people of Jacurutu/Shuloch, but only traces.This saddened him by revealing what had been lost.Slowly, so slowly that the knowledge was fully upon him before he recognized its beginnings, Leto grew aware of the soft rustling of many creatures all around him.Sandtrout.Soon it would be time to shift from one vision to another.He felt the movement of sandtrout as a movement within himself.Fremen had lived with the strange creatures for generations, knowing that if you risked a bit of water as bait, you could lure them into reach.Many a Fremen dying of thirst had risked his last few drops of water in this gamble, knowing that the sweet green syrup teased from a sandtrout might yield a small profit in energy.But the sandtrout were mostly the game of children who caught them for the Huanui.And for play.Leto shuddered at the thought of what that play meant to him now.He felt one of the creatures slither across his bare foot.It hesitated, then went on, attracted by the greater amount of water in the qanat.For a moment, though, he'd felt the reality of his terrible decision.The sandtrout glove.It was the play of children.If one held a sandtrout in the hand, smoothing it over your skin, it formed a living glove.Traces of blood in the skin's capillaries could be sensed by the creatures, but something mingled with the blood's water repelled them.Sooner or later, the glove would slip off into the sand, there to be lifted into a spice fiber basket.The spice soothed them until they were dumped into the deathstill.He could hear sandtrout dropping into the qanat, the swirl of predators eating them.Water softened the sandtrout, made it pliable.Children learned this early.A bit of saliva teased out the sweet syrup.Leto listened to the splashing.This was a migration of sandtrout come up to the open water, but they could not contain a flowing qanat patrolled by predator fish.Still they came; still they splashed.Leto groped on the sand with his right hand until his fingers encountered the leathery skin of a sandtrout.It was the large one he had expected.The creature didn't try to evade him, but moved eagerly onto his flesh.He explored its outline with his free hand   roughly diamond shaped.It had no head, no extremities, no eyes, yet it could find water unerringly.With its fellows it could join body to body, locking one on another by the coarse interlacings of extruded cilia until the whole became one large sack organism enclosing the water, walling off the "poison" from the giant which the sandtrout would become: Shai Hulud.The sandtrout squirmed on his hand, elongating, stretching.As it moved, he felt a counterpart elongating and stretching of the vision he had chosen.This thread, not that one.He felt the sandtrout becoming thin, covering more and more of his hand.No sandtrout had ever before encountered a hand such as this one, every cell supersaturated with spice.No other human had ever before lived and reasoned in such a condition.Delicately Leto adjusted his enzyme balance, drawing on the illuminated sureness he'd gained in spice trance.The knowledge from those uncounted lifetimes which blended themselves within him provided the certainty through which he chose the precise adjustments, slaving off the death from an overdose which would engulf him if he relaxed his watchfulness for only a heartbeat.And at the same time he blended himself with the sandtrout, feeding on it, feeding it, learning it.His trance vision provided the template and he followed it precisely.Leto felt the sandtrout grow thin, spreading itself over more and more of his hand, reaching up his arm.He located another, placed it over the first one.Contact ignited a frenzied squirming in the creatures.Their cilia locked and they became a single membrane which enclosed him to the elbow.The sandtrout adjusted to the living glove of childhood play, but thinner and more sensitive as he lured it into the role of a skin symbiote.He reached down with the living glove, felt sand, each grain distinct to his senses.This was no longer sandtrout; it was tougher, stronger.And it would grow stronger and stronger...His groping hand encountered another sandtrout which whipped itself into union with the first two and adapted itself to the new role.Leathery softness insinuated itself up his arm to his shoulder.With a terrible singleness of concentration he achieved the union of his new skin with his body, preventing rejection.No corner of his attention was left to dwell upon the terrifying consequences of what he did here.Only the necessities of his trance vision mattered.Only the Golden Path could come from this ordeal.Leto shed his robe and lay naked upon the sand, his gloved arm outstretched into the path of migrating sandtrout.He remembered that once he and Ghanima had caught a sandtrout, abraded it against the sand until it contracted into the child worm, a stiff tube, its interior pregnant with the green syrup.One bit gently upon the end and sucked swiftly before the wound was healed, gaining the few drops of sweetness.They were all over his body now.He could feel the pulse of his blood against the living membrane.One tried to cover his face, but he moved it roughly until it elongated into a thin roll.The thing grew much longer than the child worm, remaining flexible.Leto bit the end of it, tasted a thin stream of sweetness which continued far longer than any Fremen had ever before experienced.He could feel energy from the sweetness flow through him.A curious excitement suffused his body.He was kept busy for a time rolling the membrane away from his face until he'd built up a stiff ridge circling from jaw to forehead and leaving his ears exposed.Now the vision must be tested.He got to his feet, turned to run back toward the hut and, as he moved, found his feet moving too fast for him to balance.He plunged into the sand, rolled and leaped to his feet.The leap took him two meters off the sand and, when he fell back, trying to walk, he again moved too fast.Stop!he commanded himself.He fell into the prana bindu forced relaxation, gathering his senses into the pool of consciousness.This focused the inward ripples of the constant now through which he experienced Time, and he allowed the vision elation to warm him.The membrane worked precisely as the vision had predicted.My skin is not my own.But his muscles took some training to live with this amplified movement.When he walked, he fell, rolling.Presently he sat.In the quiet, the ridge below his jaw tried to become a membrane covering his mouth.He spat against it and bit, tasting the sweet syrup.It rolled downward to the pressure of his hand.Enough time had passed to form the union with his body.Leto stretched flat and turned onto his face.He began to crawl, rasping the membrane against the sand.He could feel the sand distinctly, but nothing abraded his own flesh.With only a few swimming movements he traversed fifty meters of sand.The physical reaction was a friction induced warming sensation.The membrane no longer tried to cover his nose and mouth, but now he faced the second major step onto his Golden Path.His exertions had taken him beyond the qanat into the canyon where the trapped worm stayed.He heard it hissing toward him, attracted by his movements.Leto leaped to his feet, intending to stand and wait, but the amplified movement sent him sprawling twenty meters farther into the canyon.Controlling his reactions with terrible effort, he sat back onto his haunches, straightened.Now the sand began to swell directly in front of him, rising up in a monstrous starlit curve.Sand opened only two body lengths from him.Crystal teeth flashed in the dim light.He saw the yawning mouth cavern with, far back, the ambient movement of dim flame.The overpowering redolence of the spice swept over him.But the worm had stopped.It remained in front of him as First Moon lifted over the butte.The light reflected off the worm's teeth outlining the faery glow of chemical fires deep within the creature.So deep was the inbred Fremen fear that Leto found himself torn by a desire to flee.But his vision held him motionless, fascinated by this prolonged moment.No one had ever before stood this close to the mouth of a living worm and survived.Gently Leto moved his right foot, met a sand ridge and, reacting too quickly, was propelled toward the worm's mouth.He came to a stop on his knees.Still the worm did not move.It sensed only the sandtrout and would not attack the deep sand vector of its own kind.The worm would attack another worm in its territory and would come to exposed spice.Only a water barrier stopped it   and sandtrout, encapsulating water, were a water barrier.Experimentally, Leto moved a hand toward that awesome mouth.The worm drew back a full meter.Confidence restored, Leto turned away from the worm and began teaching his muscles to live with their new power.Cautiously he walked back toward the qanat.The worm remained motionless behind him.When Leto was beyond the water barrier he leaped with joy, went sailing ten meters across the sand, sprawled, rolled, laughed.Light flared on the sand as the hut's doorseal was breached.Sabiha stood outlined in the yellow and purple glow of the lamp, staring out at him.Laughing, Leto ran back across the qanat, stopped in front of the worm, turned and faced her with his arms outstretched."Look!"he called."The worm does my bidding!"As she stood in frozen shock, he whirled, went racing around the worm and into the canyon.Gaining experience with his new skin, he found he could run with only the lightest flexing of muscles.It was almost effortless.When he put effort into running, he raced over the sand with the wind burning the exposed circle of his face.At the canyon's dead end instead of stopping, he leaped up a full fifteen meters, clawed at the cliff, scrabbled, climbing like an insect, and came out on the crest above the Tanzerouft.The desert stretched before him, a vast silvery undulance in the moonlight.Leto's manic exhilaration receded.He squatted, sensing how light his body felt.Exertion had produced a slick film of perspiration which a stillsuit would have absorbed and routed into the transfer tissue which removed the salts.Even as he relaxed, the film disappeared now, absorbed by the membrane faster than a stillsuit could have done it.Thoughtfully Leto rolled a length of the membrane beneath his lips, pulled it into his mouth, and drank the sweetness.His mouth was not masked, though.Fremen wise, he sensed his body's moisture being wasted with every breath.Leto brought a section of the membrane over his mouth, rolled it back when it tried to seal his nostrils, kept at this until the rolled barrier remained in place.In the desert way, he fell into the automatic breathing pattern: in through his nose, out through his mouth.The membrane over his mouth protruded in a small bubble, but remained in place.No moisture collected on his lips and his nostrils remained open.The adaptation proceeded, then.A 'thopter flew between Leto and the moon, banked, and came in for a spread wing landing on the butte perhaps a hundred meters to his left.Leto glanced at it, turned, and looked back the way he had come up the canyon.Many lights could be seen down there beyond the qanat, a stirring of a multitude.He heard faint outcries, sensed hysteria in the sounds.Two men approached him from the 'thopter.Moonlight glinted on their weapons.The Mashhad, Leto thought, and it was a sad thought.Here was the great leap onto the Golden Path.He had put on the living, self repairing stillsuit of a sandtrout membrane, a thing of unmeasurable value on Arrakis...until you understood the price.I am no longer human.The legends about this night will grow and magnify it beyond anything recognizable by the participants.But it will become truth, that legend.He peered down from the butte, estimated the desert floor lay two hundred meters below.The moon picked out ledges and cracks on the steep face but no connecting pathway.Leto stood, inhaled a deep breath, glanced back at the approaching men, then stepped to the cliff's edge and launched himself into space.Some thirty meters down his flexed legs encountered a narrow ledge.Amplified muscles absorbed the shock and rebounded in a leap sideways to another ledge, where he caught a narrow outcropping with his hands, dropped twenty meters, leaped to another handhold and once more went down, bouncing, leaping, grasping tiny ledges.He took the final forty meters in one jump, landing in a bent knee roll which sent him plunging down the slip face of a dune in a shower of sand and dust.At the bottom he scrambled to his feet, launched himself to the next dunecrest in one jump.He could hear hoarse shouts from atop the cliff but ignored them to concentrate on the leaping strides from dunetop to dunetop.As he grew more accustomed to amplified muscles he found a sensuous joy that he had not anticipated in this distance gulping movement.It was a ballet on the desert, defiance of the Tanzerouft which no other had ever experienced.When he judged that the ornithopter's occupants had overcome their shock enough to mount pursuit once more, he dove for the moon shadowed face of a dune, burrowed into it.The sand was like heavy liquid to his new strength, but the temperature mounted dangerously when he moved too fast.He broke free on the far face of the dune, found that the membrane had covered his nostrils.He removed it, sensed the new skin pulsing over his body in its labor to absorb his perspiration.Leto fashioned a tube at his mouth, drank the syrup while he peered upward at the starry sky.He estimated he had come fifteen kilometers from Shuloch.Presently a 'thopter drew its pattern across the stars, a great bird shape followed by another and another.He heard the soft swishing of their wings, the whisper of their muted jets.Sipping at the living tube, he waited.First Moon passed through its track, then Second Moon.An hour before dawn Leto crept out and up to the dunecrest, examined the sky.No hunters.Now he knew himself to be embarked upon a path of no return.Ahead lay the trap in Time and Space which had been prepared as an unforgettable lesson for himself and all of mankind.Leto turned northeast and loped another fifty kilometers before burrowing into the sand for the day, leaving only a tiny hole to the surface which he kept open with a sandtrout tube.The membrane was learning how to live with him as he learned how to live with it.He tried not to think of the other things it was doing to his flesh.Tomorrow I'll raid Gara Rulen, he thought.I'll smash their qanat and loose its water into the sand.Then I'll go on to Windsack, Old Gap, and Harg.In a month the ecological transformation will have been set back a full generation.That'll give us space to develop the new timetable.And the wildness of the rebel tribes would be blamed, of course.Some would revive memories of Jacurutu.Alia would have her hands full.As for Ghanima...Silently to himself, Leto mouthed the words which would restore her memory.Time for that later...if they survived this terrible mixing of threads.The Golden Path lured him out there on the desert, almost a physical thing which he could see with his open eyes.And he thought how it was: as animals must move across the land, their existence dependent upon that movement the soul of humankind, blocked for eons, needed a track upon which it could move.He thought of his father then, telling himself: "Soon we'll dispute as man to man, and only one vision will emerge. "= = = = = =   Limits of survival are set by climate, those long drifts of change which a generation may fail to notice.And it is the extremes of climate which set the pattern.Lonely, finite humans may observe climatic provinces, fluctuations of annual weather and, occasionally may observe such things as "This is a colder year than I've ever known.  "Such things are sensible.But humans are seldom alerted to the shifting average through a great span of years.And it is precisely in this alerting that humans learn how to survive on any planet.They must learn climate.Arrakis, the Transformation, After Harq al Ada   Alia sat cross legged on her bed, trying to compose herself by reciting the Litany Against Fear, but chuckling derision echoed in her skull to block every effort.She could hear the voice; it controlled her ears, her mind."What nonsense is this?What have you to fear?"The muscles of her calves twitched as her feet tried to make running motions.There was nowhere to run.She wore only a golden gown of the sheerest Palian silk and it revealed the plumpness which had begun to bulge her body.The Hour of Assassins had just passed; dawn was near.Reports covering the past three months lay before her on the red coverlet.She could hear the humming of the air conditioner and a small breeze stirred the labels on the shigawire spools.Aides had awakened her fearfully two hours earlier, bringing news of the latest outrage, and Alia had called for the report spools, seeking an intelligible pattern.She gave up on the Litany.These attacks had to be the work of rebels.Obviously.More and more of them turned against Muad'Dib's religion."And what's wrong with that?"the derisive voice asked within her.Alia shook her head savagely.Namri had failed her.She'd been a fool to trust such a dangerous double instrument.Her aides whispered that Stilgar was to blame, that he was a secret rebel.And what had become of Halleck?Gone to ground among his smuggler friends?Possibly.She picked up one of the report spools.And Muriz!The man was hysterical.That was the only possible explanation.Otherwise she'd have to believe in miracles.No human, let alone a child (even a child such as Leto) could leap from the butte at Shuloch and survive to flee across the desert in leaps that took him from dunecrest to dunecrest.Alia felt the coldness of the shigawire under her hand.Where was Leto, then?Ghanima refused to believe him other than dead.A Truthsayer had confirmed her story: Leto slain by a Laza tiger.Then who was the child reported by Namri and Muriz?She shuddered.Forty qanats had been breached, their waters loosed into the sand.The loyal Fremen and even the rebels, superstitious louts, all!Her reports were flooded with stories of mysterious occurrences.Sandtrout leaped into qanats and shattered to become hosts of small replicas.Worms deliberately drowned themselves.Blood dripped from Second Moon and fell to Arrakis, where it stirred up great storms.And the storm frequency was increasing!She thought of Duncan incommunicado at Tabr, fretting under the restraints she'd exacted from Stilgar.He and Irulan talked of little else than the real meaning behind these omens.Fools!Even her spies betrayed the influence of these outrageous stories!Why did Ghanima insist on her story of the Laza tiger?Alia sighed.Only one of the reports on the shigawire spools reassured her.Farad'n had sent a contingent of his household guard "to help you in troubles and to prepare the way for the Official Rite of Betrothal. "Alia smiled to herself and shared the chuckle which rumbled in her skull.That plan, at least, remained intact.Logical explanations would be found to dispel all of this other superstitious nonsense.Meanwhile she'd use Farad'n's men to help close down Shuloch and to arrest the known dissidents, especially among the Naibs.She debated moving against Stilgar, but the inner voice cautioned against this."Not yet. ""My mother and the Sisterhood still have some plan of their own," Alia whispered."Why is she training Farad'n?""Perhaps he excites her," the Old Baron said."Not that cold one. ""You're not thinking of asking Farad'n to return her?""I know the dangers in that!""Good.Meanwhile, that young aide Zia recently brought in.I believe his name's Agarves   Buer Agarves.If you'd invite him here tonight... ""No!""Alia... ""It's almost dawn, you insatiable old fool!There's a Military Council meeting this morning, the Priests will have  "  "Don't trust them, darling Alia. ""Of course not!""Very well.Now, this Buer Agarves... ""I said no!"The Old Baron remained silent within her, but she began to feel a headache.A slow pain crept upward from her left cheek into her skull.Once he'd sent her raging down the corridors with this trick.Now, she resolved to resist him."If you persist, I'll take a sedative," she said.He could see she meant it.The headache began to recede."Very well. "Petulant."Another time, then. ""Another time," she agreed.= = = = = =   Thou didst divide the sand by thy strength; Thou breakest the heads of the dragons in the desert.Yea, I behold thee as a beast coming up from the dunes; thou hast the two horns of the lamb, but thou speakest as the dragon.Revised Orange Catholic Bible Arran 11:4   It was the immutable prophecy, the threads become rope, a thing Leto now seemed to have known all of his life.He looked out across the evening shadows on the Tanzerouft.One hundred and seventy kilometers due north lay Old Gap, the deep and twisting crevasse through the Shield Wall by which the first Fremen had migrated into the desert.No doubts remained in Leto.He knew why he stood here alone in the desert, yet filled with a sense that he owned this entire land, that it must do his bidding.He felt the chord which connected him with all of humankind and that profound need for a universe of experiences which made logical sense, a universe of recognizable regularities within its perpetual changes.I know this universe.The worm which had brought him here had come to the stamping of his foot and, rising up in front of him, had stopped like an obedient beast.He'd leaped atop it and, with only his membrane amplified hands, had exposed the leading lip of the worm's rings to keep it on the surface.The worm had exhausted itself in the nightlong dash northward.Its silicon sulfur internal "factory" had worked at capacity, exhaling lavish gusts of oxygen which a following wind had sent in enveloping eddies around Leto.At times the warm gusts had made him dizzy, filled his mind with strange perceptions.The reflexive and circular subjectivity of his visions had turned inward upon his ancestry, forcing him to relive portions of his Terranic past, then comparing those portions with his changing self.Already he could feel how far he'd drifted from something recognizably human.Seduced by the spice which he gulped from every trace he found, the membrane which covered him no longer was sandtrout, just as he was no longer human.Cilia had crept into his flesh, forming a new creature which would seek its own metamorphosis in the eons ahead.You saw this, father, and rejected it, he thought.It was a thing too terrible to face.Leto knew what was believed of his father, and why.Muad'Dib died of prescience.But Paul Atreides had passed from the universe of reality into the alam al mythal while still alive, fleeing from this thing which his son had dared.Now there was only The Preacher.Leto squatted on the sand and kept his attention northward.The worm would come from that direction, and on its back would ride two people: a young Fremen and a blind man.A flight of pallid bats passed over Leto's head, bending their course southeast.They were random specks in the darkening sky, and a knowledgeable Fremen eye could mark their back course to learn where shelter lay that way.The Preacher would avoid that shelter, though.His destination was Shuloch, where no wild bats were permitted lest they guide strangers to a secret place.The worm appeared first as a dark movement between the desert and the northern sky.Matar, the rain of sand dropped from high altitudes by a dying stormwind, obscured the view for a few minutes, then it returned clearer and closer.The cold line at the base of the dune where Leto crouched began to produce its nightly moisture.He tasted the fragile dampness in his nostrils, adjusted the bubble cap of the membrane over his mouth.There no longer was any need for him to find soaks and sip wells.From his mother's genes he had that longer, larger Fremen large intestine to take back water from everything which came its way.The living stillsuit grasped and retained every bit of moisture it encountered.And even while he sat here the membrane which touched sand extruded pseudopod cilia to hunt for bits of energy which it could store.Leto studied the approaching worm.He knew the youthful guide had seen him by this time, noting the spot atop the dune.The worm rider would discern no principle in this object seen from a distance, but that was a problem Fremen had learned how to handle.Any unknown object was dangerous.The young guide's reactions would be quite predictable, even without the vision.True to that prediction, the worm's course shifted slightly and aimed directly at Leto.Giant worms were a weapon which Fremen had employed many times.Worms had helped beat Shaddam at Arrakeen.This worm, however, failed to do its rider's bidding.It came to a halt ten meters away and no manner of goading would send it across another grain of sand.Leto arose, feeling the cilia snap back into the membrane behind him.He freed his mouth and called out: "Achlan, wasachlan!"Welcome, twice welcome!The blind man stood behind his guide atop the worm, one hand on the youth's shoulder.The man held his face high, nose pointed over Leto's head as though trying to sniff out this interruption.Sunset painted orange on his forehead."Who is that?"the blind man asked, shaking his guide's shoulder."Why have we stopped?"His voice was nasal through the stillsuit plugs.The youth stared fearfully down at Leto, said: "It is only someone alone in the desert.A child by his looks.I tried to send the worm over him, but the worm won't go. ""Why didn't you say?"the blind man demanded."I thought it was only someone alone in the desert!"the youth protested."But it's a demon. ""Spoken like a true son of Jacurutu," Leto said."And you, sire, you are The Preacher. ""I am that one, yes. "And there was fear in The Preacher's voice because, at last, he had met his own past."This is no garden," Leto said, "but you are welcome to share this place with me tonight. ""Who are you?"The Preacher demanded."How have you stopped our worm?"There was an ominous tone of recognition in The Preacher's voice.Now he called up the memories of this alternate vision...knowing he could reach an end here."It's a demon!"the young guide protested."We must flee this place or our souls  "  "Silence!"The Preacher roared."I am Leto Atreides," Leto said."Your worm stopped because I commanded it. "The Preacher stood in frozen silence."Come, father," Leto said."Alight and spend the night with me.I'll give you sweet syrup to sip.I see you've Fremkits with food and water jars.We'll share our riches here upon the sand. ""Leto's yet a child," The Preacher protested."And they say he's dead of Corrino treachery.There's no childhood in your voice. ""You know me, sire," Leto said."I'm small for my age as you were, but my experience is ancient and my voice has learned. ""What do you here in the Inner Desert?"The Preacher asked."Bu ji," Leto said.Nothing from nothing.It was the answer of a Zensunni wanderer, one who acted only from a position of rest, without effort and in harmony with his surroundings.The Preacher shook his guide's shoulder."Is it a child, truly a child?""Aiya," the youth said, keeping a fearful attention on Leto.A great shuddering sigh shook The Preacher."No," he said."It is a demon in child form," the guide said."You will spend the night here," Leto said."We will do as he says," The Preacher said.He released his grip on the guide, slipped off the worm's side and slid down a ring to the sand, leaping clear when his feet touched.Turning, he said: "Take the worm off and send it back into the sand.It is tired and will not bother us. ""The worm will not go!"the youth protested."It will go," Leto said."But if you try to flee on it, I'll let it eat you. "He moved to one side out of the worm's sensory range, pointed in the direction they had come."Go that way. "The youth tapped a goad against the ring behind him, wiggled a hook where it held a ring open.Slowly the worm began to slide over the sand, turning as the youth shifted his hook down a side.The Preacher, following the sound of Leto's voice, clambered up the duneslope and stood two paces away.It was done with a swift sureness which told Leto this would be no easy contest.Here the visions parted.Leto said: "Remove your suit mask, father. "The Preacher obeyed, dropping the fold of his hood and withdrawing the mouth cover.Knowing his own appearance, Leto studied this face, seeing the lines of likeness as though they'd been outlined in light.The lines formed an indefinable reconciliation, a pathway of genes without sharp boundaries, and there was no mistaking them.Those lines came down to Leto from the humming days, from the water dripping days, from the miracle seas of Caladan.But now they stood at a dividing point on Arrakis as night waited to fold itself into the dunes."So father," Leto said glancing to the left where he could see the youthful guide trudging back to them from where the worm had been abandoned."Mu zein!"'The Preacher said, waving his right hand in a cutting gesture.This is no good!"Koolish zein," Leto said, voice soft.This is all the good we may ever have.And he added, speaking in Chakobsa, the Atreides battle language: "Here I am; here I remain!We cannot forget that, father. "The Preacher's shoulders sagged.He put both hands to his empty sockets in a long unused gesture."I gave you the sight of my eyes once and took your memories," Leto said."I know your decisions and I've been to that place where you hid yourself. ""I know. "The Preacher lowered his hands."You will remain?""You named me for the man who put that on his coat of arms," Leto said."J'y suis, j'y reste!"The Preacher sighed deeply."How far has it gone, this thing you've done to yourself?""My skin is not my own, father. "The Preacher shuddered."Then I know how you found me here. ""Yes, I fastened my memory to a place my flesh had never known," Leto said."I need an evening with my father. ""I'm not your father.I'm only a poor copy, a relic. "He turned his head toward the sound of the approaching guide."I no longer go to the visions for my future. "As he spoke, darkness covered the desert.Stars leaped out above them and Leto, too, turned toward the approaching guide."Wubakh ul kuhar!"Leto called to the youth."Greetings!"Back came the response: "Subakh un nar!"Speaking in a hoarse whisper, The Preacher said: "That young Assan Tariq is a dangerous one. ""All of the Cast Out are dangerous," Leto said."But not to me. "He spoke in a low, conversational tone."If that's your vision, I will not share it," The Preacher said."Perhaps you have no choice," Leto said."You are the fit haquiqa.The Reality.You are Abu Dhur, Father of the Indefinite Roads of Time. ""I'm no more than bait in a trap," The Preacher said, and his voice was bitter."And Alia already has eaten that bait," Leto said."But I don't like its taste. ""You cannot do this!"The Preacher hissed."I've already done it.My skin is not my own. ""Perhaps it's not too late for you to  "  "It is too late. "Leto bent his head to one side.He could hear Assan Tariq trudging up the duneslope toward them, coming to the sound of their voices."Greetings, Assan Tariq of Shuloch," Leto said.The youth stopped just below Leto on the slope, a dark shadow there in the starlight.There was indecision in the set of his shoulders, the way he tipped his head."Yes," Leto said, "I'm the one who escaped from Shuloch. ""When I heard... "The Preacher began.And again: "You cannot do this!""I am doing it.What matter if you're made blind once more?""You think I fear that?"The Preacher asked."Do you not see the fine guide they have provided for me?""I see him. "Again Leto faced Tariq."Didn't you hear me, Assan?I'm the one who escaped from Shuloch. ""You're a demon," the youth quavered."Your demon," Leto said."But you are my demon. "And Leto felt the tension grow between himself and his father.It was a shadow play all around them, a projection of unconscious forms.And Leto felt the memories of his father, a form of backward prophecy which sorted visions from the familiar reality of this moment.Tariq sensed it, this battle of the visions.He slid several paces backward down the slope."You cannot control the future," The Preacher whispered, and the sound of his voice was filled with effort as though he lifted a great weight.Leto felt the dissonance between them then.It was an element of the universe with which his entire life grappled.Either he or his father would be forced to act soon, making a decision by that act, choosing a vision.And his father was right: trying for some ultimate control of the universe, you only built weapons with which the universe eventually defeated you.To choose and manage a vision required you to balance on a single, thin thread   playing God on a high tightwire with cosmic solitude on both sides.Neither contestant could retreat into death as surcease from paradox.Each knew the visions and the rules.All of the old illusions were dying.And when one contestant moved, the other might countermove.The only real truth that mattered to them now was that which separated them from the vision background.There was no place of safety, only a transitory shifting of relationships, marked out within the limits which they now imposed and bound for inevitable changes.Each of them had only a desperate and lonely courage upon which to rely, but Leto possessed two advantages: he had committed himself upon a path from which there was no turning back, and he had accepted the terrible consequences to himself.His father still hoped there was a way back and had made no final commitment."You must not!You must not!"The Preacher rasped.He sees my advantage, Leto thought.Leto spoke in a conversational tone, masking his own tensions, the balancing effort this other level contest required."I have no passionate belief in truth, no faith other than what I create," he said.And he felt then a movement between himself and his father, something with granular characteristics which touched only Leto's own passionately subjective belief in himself.By such belief he knew that he posted the markers of the Golden Path.Someday such markers could tell others how to be human, a strange gift from a creature who no longer would be human on that day.But these markers were always set in place by gamblers.Leto felt them scattered throughout the landscape of his inner lives and, feeling this, poised himself for the ultimate gamble.Softly he sniffed the air, seeking the signal which both he and his father knew must come.One question remained: Would his father warn the terrified young guide who waited below them?Presently Leto sensed ozone in his nostrils, the betraying odor of a shield.True to his orders from the Cast Out, young Tariq was trying to kill both of these dangerous Atreides, not knowing the horrors which this would precipitate."Don't," The Preacher whispered.But Leto knew the signal was a true one.He sensed ozone, but there was no tingling in the air around them.Tariq used a pseudo shield in the desert, a weapon developed exclusively for Arrakis.The Holtzmann Effect would summon a worm while it maddened that worm.Nothing would stop such a worm   not water, not the presence of sandtrout...nothing.Yes, the youth had planted the device in the duneslope and was beginning to edge away from the danger zone.Leto launched himself off the dunetop, hearing his father scream in protest.But the awful impetus of Leto's amplified muscles threw his body like a missile.One outflung hand caught the neck of Tariq's stillsuit, the other slapped around to grip the doomed youth's robe at the waist.There came a single snap as the neck broke.Leto rolled, lifting his body like a finely balanced instrument which dove directly into the sand where the pseudo shield had been hidden.Fingers found the thing and he had it out of the sand, throwing it in a looping arc far out to the south of them.Presently there came a great hissing thrashing din out on the desert where the pseudo shield had gone.It subsided, and silence returned.Leto looked up to the top of the dune where his father stood, still defiant, but defeated.That was Paul Muad'Dib up there, blind, angry, near despair as a consequence of his flight from the vision which Leto had accepted.Paul's mind would be reflecting now upon the Zensunni Long Koan: "In the one act of predicting an accurate future, Muad'Dib introduced an element of development and growth into the very prescience through which he saw human existence.By this, he brought uncertainty onto himself.Seeking the absolute of orderly prediction, he amplified disorder, distorted prediction. "Returning to the dunetop in a single leap, Leto said: "Now I'm your guide. ""Never!""Would you go back to Shuloch?Even if they'd welcome you when you arrived without Tariq, where has Shuloch gone now?Do your eyes see it?"Paul confronted his son then, aiming the eyeless sockets at Leto."Do you really know the universe you have created here?"Leto heard the particular emphasis.The vision which both of them knew had been set into terrible motion here had required an act of creation at a certain point in time.For that moment, the entire sentient universe shared a linear view of time which possessed characteristics of orderly progression.They entered this time as they might step onto a moving vehicle, and they could only leave it the same way.Against this, Leto held the multi thread reins, balanced in his own vision lighted view of time as multilinear and multilooped.He was the sighted man in the universe of the blind.Only he could scatter the orderly rationale because his father no longer held the reins.In Leto's view, a son had altered the past.And a thought as yet undreamed in the farthest future could reflect upon the now and move his hand.Only his hand.Paul knew this because he no longer could see how Leto might manipulate the reins, could only recognize the inhuman consequences which Leto had accepted.And he thought: Here is the change for which I prayed.Why do I fear it?Because it's the Golden Path!"I'm here to give purpose to evolution and, therefore, to give purpose to our lives," Leto said."Do you wish to live those thousands of years, changing as you now know you will change?"Leto recognized that his father was not speaking about physical changes.Both of them knew the physical consequences: Leto would adapt and adapt; the skin which was not his own would adapt and adapt.The evolutionary thrust of each part would melt into the other and a single transformation would emerge.When metamorphosis came, if it came, a thinking creature of awesome dimensions would emerge upon the universe   and that universe would worship him.No...Paul was referring to the inner changes, the thoughts and decisions which would inflict themselves upon the worshipers."Those who think you dead," Leto said, "you know what they say about your last words. ""Of course. "" 'Now I do what all life must do in the service of life,' " Leto said."You never said that, but a Priest who thought you could never return and call him liar put those words into your mouth. ""I'd not call him liar. "Paul took in a deep breath."Those are good last words. ""Would you stay here or return to that hut in the basin of Shuloch?"Leto asked."This is your universe now," Paul said.The words filled with defeat cut through Leto.Paul had tried to guide the last strands of a personal vision, a choice he'd made years before in Sietch Tabr.For that, he'd accepted his role as an instrument of revenge for the Cast Out, the remnants of Jacurutu.They had contaminated him, but he'd accepted this rather than his view of this universe which Leto had chosen.The sadness in Leto was so great he could not speak for several minutes.When he could manage his voice, Leto said: "So you baited Alia, tempted her and confused her into inaction and the wrong decisions.And now she knows who you are. ""She knows...Yes, she knows. "Paul's voice was old then and filled with hidden protests.There was a reserve of defiance in him, though.He said: "I'll take the vision away from you if I can. ""Thousands of peaceful years," Leto said."That's what I'll give them. ""Dormancy!Stagnation!""Of course.And those forms of violence which I permit.It'll be a lesson which humankind will never forget. ""I spit on your lesson!"Paul said."You think I've not seen a thing similar to what you choose?""You saw it," Leto agreed."Is your vision any better than mine?""Not one whit better.Worse, perhaps," Leto said."Then what can I do but resist you?"Paul demanded."Kill me, perhaps?""I'm not that innocent.I know what you've set in motion.I know about the broken qanats and the unrest. ""And now Assan Tariq will never return to Shuloch.You must go back with me or not at all because this is my vision now. ""I choose not to go back. "How old his voice sounds, Leto thought, and the thought was a wrenching pain.He said: "I've the hawk ring of the Atreides concealed in my dishdasha.Do you wish me to return it to you?""If I'd only died," Paul whispered."I truly wanted to die when I went into the desert that night, but I knew I could not leave this world.I had to come back and  "  "Restore the legend," Leto said."I know.And the jackals of Jacurutu were waiting for you that night as you knew they would be.They wanted your visions!You knew that. ""I refused.I never gave them one vision. ""But they contaminated you.They fed you spice essence and plied you with women and dreams.And you did have visions. ""Sometimes. "How sly his voice sounded."Will you take back your hawk ring?"Leto asked.Paul sat down suddenly on the sand, a dark blotch in the starlight."No!"So he knows the futility of that path, Leto thought.This revealed much, but not enough.The contest of the visions had moved from its delicate plane of choices down to a gross discarding of alternates.Paul knew he could not win, but he hoped yet to nullify that single vision to which Leto clung.Presently Paul said: "Yes, I was contaminated by the Jacurutu.But you contaminate yourself. ""That's true," Leto admitted."I am your son. ""And are you a good Fremen?""Yes. ""Will you permit a blind man to go into the desert finally?Will you let me find peace on my own terms?"He pounded the sand beside him."No, I'll not permit that," Leto said."But it's your right to fall upon your knife if you insist upon it. ""And you would have my body!""True. ""No!"And so he knows that path, Leto thought.The enshrining of Muad'Dib's body by his son could be contrived as a form of cement for Leto's vision."You never told them, did you, father?"Leto asked."I never told them. ""But I told them," Leto said."I told Muriz.Kralizec, the Typhoon Struggle. "Paul's shoulders sagged."You cannot," he whispered."You cannot. ""I am a creature of this desert now, father," Leto said."Would you speak thus to a Coriolis storm?""You think me coward for refusing that path," Paul said, his voice husky and trembling."Oh, I understand you well, son.Augury and haruspication have always been their own torments.But I was never lost in the possible futures because this one is unspeakable!""Your Jihad will be a summer picnic on Caladan by comparison," Leto agreed."I'll take you to Gurney Halleck now. ""Gurney!He serves the Sisterhood through my mother. "And now Leto understood the extent of his father's vision."No, father.Gurney no longer serves anyone.I know the place to find him and I can take you there.It's time for the new legend to be created. ""I see that I cannot sway you.Let me touch you, then, for you are my son. "Leto held out his right hand to meet the groping fingers, felt their strength, matched it, and resisted every shift of Paul's arm."Not even a poisoned knife will harm me now," Leto said."I'm already a different chemistry. "Tears slipped from the sightless eyes and Paul released his grip, dropped his hand to his side."If I'd chosen your way, I'd have become the bicouros of shaitan.What will you become?""For a time they'll call me the missionary of shaitan, too," Leto said."Then they'll begin to wonder and, finally, they'll understand.You didn't take your vision far enough, father.Your hands did good things and evil. ""But the evil was known after the event!""Which is the way of many great evils," Leto said."You crossed over only into a part of my vision.Was your strength not enough?""You know I couldn't stay there.I could never do an evil act which was known before the act.I'm not Jacurutu. "He clambered to his feet."Do you think me one of those who laughs alone at night?""It is sad that you were never really Fremen," Leto said."We Fremen know how to commission the arifa.Our judges can choose between evils.It's always been that way for us. ""Fremen, is it?Slaves of the fate you helped to make?"Paul stepped toward Leto, reached out in an oddly shy movement, touched Leto's sheathed arm, explored up it to where the membrane exposed an ear, then the cheek and, finally, the mouth."Ahhhh, that is your own flesh yet," he said."Where will that flesh take you?"He dropped his hand."Into a place where humans may create their futures from instant to instant. ""So you say.An Abomination might say the same. ""I'm not Abomination, though I might've been," Leto said."I saw how it goes with Alia.A demon lives in her, father.Ghani and I know that demon: it's the Baron, your grandfather. "Paul buried his face in his hands.His shoulders shook for a moment, then he lowered his hands and his mouth was set in a harsh line."There is a curse upon our House.I prayed that you would throw that ring into the sand, that you'd deny me and run away to make...another life.It was there for you. ""At what price?"After a long silence, Paul said: "The end adjusts the path behind it.Just once I failed to fight for my principles.Just once.I accepted the Mahdinate.I did it for Chani, but it made me a bad leader. "Leto found he couldn't answer this.The memory of that decision was there within him."I cannot lie to you any more than I could lie to myself," Paul said."I know this.Every man should have such an auditor.I will only ask this one thing: is the Typhoon Struggle necessary?""It's that or humans will be extinguished. "Paul heard the truth in Leto's words, spoke in a low voice which acknowledged the greater breadth of his son's vision."I did not see that among the choices. ""I believe the Sisterhood suspects it," Leto said."I cannot accept any other explanation of my grandmother's decision. "The night wind blew coldly around them then.It whipped Paul's robe around his legs.He trembled.Seeing this, Leto said: "You've a kit, father.I'll inflate the tent and we can spend this night in comfort. "But Paul could only shake his head, knowing he would have no comfort from this night or any other.Muad'Dib, The Hero, must be destroyed.He'd said it himself.Only The Preacher could go on now.= = = = = =   Fremen were the first humans to develop a conscious/unconscious symbology through which to experience the movements and relationships of their planetary system.They were the first people anywhere to express climate in terms of a semi mathematic language whose written symbols embody (and internalize) the external relationships.The language itself was part of the system it described.Its written form carried the shape of what it described.The intimate local knowledge of what was available to support life was implicit in this development.One can measure the extent of this language/system interaction by the fact that Fremen accepted themselves as foraging and browsing animals.The Story of Liet Kynes by Harq al Ada   "Kaveh wahid," Stilgar said.Bring coffee.He signaled with a raised hand to an aide who stood at one side near the single door to the austere rock walled room where he had spent this wakeful night.This was the place where the old Fremen Naib usually took his spartan breakfast, and it was almost breakfast time, but after such a night he did not feel hungry.He stood, stretching his muscles.Duncan Idaho sat on a low cushion near the door, trying to suppress a yawn.He had just realized that, while they talked, he and Stilgar had gone through an entire night."Forgive me, Stil," he said."I've kept you up all night. ""To stay awake all night adds a day to your life," Stilgar said, accepting the tray with coffee as it was passed in the door.He pushed a low bench in front of Idaho, placed the tray on it and sat across from his guest.Both men wore the yellow robes of mourning, but Idaho's was a borrowed garment worn because the people of Tabr had resented the Atreides green of his working uniform.Stilgar poured the dark brew from the fat copper carafe, sipped first, and lifted his cup as a signal to Idaho   the ancient Fremen custom: "It is safe; I have taken some of it.  "The coffee was Harah's work, done just as Stilgar preferred it: the beans roasted to a rose brown, ground to a fine powder in a stone mortar while still hot, and boiled immediately; a pinch of melange added.Idaho inhaled the spice rich aroma, sipped carefully but noisily.He still did not know if he had convinced Stilgar.His mentat faculties had begun to work sluggishly in the early hours of the morning, all of his computations confronted at last by the inescapable datum supplied in the message from Gurney Halleck.Alia had known about Leto!She'd known.And Javid had to be a part of that knowing."I must be freed of your restraints," Idaho said at last, taking up the arguments once more.Stilgar stood his ground."The agreement of neutrality requires me to make hard judgments, Ghani is safe here.You and Irulan are safe here.But you may not send messages.Receive messages, yes, but you may not send them.I've given my word. ""This is not the treatment usually accorded a guest and an old friend who has shared your dangers," Idaho said, knowing he'd used this argument before.Stilgar put down his cup, setting it carefully into its place on the tray and keeping his attention on it as he spoke."We Fremen don't feel guilt for the same things that arouse such feelings in others," he said.He raised his attention to Idaho's face.He must be made to take Ghani and flee this place, Idaho thought.He said: "It was not my intention to raise a storm of guilt. ""I understand that," Stilgar said."I raise the question to impress upon you our Fremen attitude, because that is what we are dealing with: Fremen.Even Alia thinks Fremen. ""And the Priests?""They are another matter," Stilgar said."They want the people to swallow the grey wind of sin, taking that into the everlasting.This is a great blotch by which they seek to know their own piety. "He spoke in a level voice, but Idaho heard the bitterness and wondered why that bitterness could not sway Stilgar."It's an old, old trick of autocratic rule," Idaho said."Alia knows it well.Good subjects must feel guilty.The guilt begins as a feeling of failure.The good autocrat provides many opportunities for failure in the populace. ""I've noticed. "Stilgar spoke dryly."But you must forgive me if I mention to you once more that this is your wife of whom you speak.It is the sister of Muad'Dib. ""She's possessed, I tell you!""Many say it.She will have to undergo the test one day.Meanwhile there are other considerations more important. "Idaho shook his head sadly."Everything I've told you can be verified.The communication with Jacurutu was always through Alia's Temple.The plot against the twins had accomplices there.Money for the sale of worms off planet goes there.All of the strings lead to Alia's office, to the Regency. "Stilgar shook his head, drew in a deep breath."This is neutral territory.I've given my word. ""Things can't go on this way!"Idaho protested."I agree. "Stilgar nodded."Alia's caught inside the circle and every day the circle grows smaller.It's like our old custom of having many wives.This pinpoints male sterility. "He bent a questioning gaze on Idaho."You say she deceived you with other men   'using her sex as a weapon' is the way I believe you've expressed it.Then you have a perfectly legal avenue available to you.Javid's here in Tabr with messages from Alia.You have only to  "  "On your neutral territory?""No, but outside in the desert... ""And if I took that opportunity to escape?""You'll not be given such an opportunity. ""Still, I swear to you, Alia's possessed.What do I have to do to convince you of  "  "A difficult thing to prove," Stilgar said.It was the argument he'd used many times during the night.Idaho recalled Jessica's words, said: "But you've ways of proving it. ""A way, yes," Stilgar said.Again he shook his head."Painful, irrevocable.That is why I remind you about our attitude toward guilt.We can free ourselves from guilts which might destroy us in everything except the Trial of Possession.For that, the tribunal, which is all of the people, accepts complete responsibility. ""You've done it before, haven't you?""I'm sure the Reverend Mother didn't omit our history in her recital," Stilgar said."You well know we've done it before. "Idaho responded to the irritation in Stilgar's voice."I wasn't trying to trap you in a falsehood.It's just  "  "It's the long night and the questions without answers," Stilgar said."And now it's morning. ""I must be allowed to send a message to Jessica," Idaho said."That would be a message to Salusa," Stilgar said."I don't make evening promises.My word is meant to be kept; that is why Tabr's neutral territory.I will hold you in silence.I have pledged this for my entire household. ""Alia must be brought to your Trial!""Perhaps.First, we must find out if there are extenuating circumstances.A failure of authority, possibly.Or even bad luck.It could be a case of that natural bad tendency which all humans share, and not possession at all. ""You want to be sure I'm not just the husband wronged, seeking others to execute his revenge," Idaho said."The thought has occurred to others, not to me," Stilgar said.He smiled to take the sting out of his words."We Fremen have our science of tradition, our hadith.When we fear a mentat or a Reverend Mother, we revert to the hadith.It is said that the only fear we cannot correct is the fear of our own mistakes. ""The Lady Jessica must be told," Idaho said."Gurney says  "  "That message may not come from Gurney Halleck. ""It comes from no other.We Atreides have our ways of verifying messages.Stil, won't you at least explore some of  "  "Jacurutu is no more," Stilgar said."It was destroyed many generations ago. "He touched Idaho's sleeve."In any event, I cannot spare the fighting men.These are troubled times, the threat to the qanat...you understand?"He sat back."Now, when Alia  "  "There is no more Alia," Idaho said."So you say. "Stilgar took another sip of coffee, replaced the cup."Let it rest there, friend Idaho.Often there's no need to tear off an arm to remove a splinter. ""Then let's talk about Ghanima. ""There's no need.She has my countenance, my bond.No one can harm her here. "He cannot be that naive, Idaho thought.But Stilgar was rising to indicate that the interview was ended.Idaho levered himself to his feet, feeling the stiffness in his knees.His calves felt numb.As Idaho stood, an aide entered and stood aside.Javid came into the room behind him.Idaho turned.Stilgar stood four paces away.Without hesitating, Idaho drew his knife in one swift motion and drove its point into the breast of the unsuspecting Javid.The man staggered backward, pulling himself off the knife.He turned, fell onto his face.His legs kicked and he was dead."That was to silence the gossip," Idaho said.The aide stood with drawn knife, undecided how to react.Idaho had already sheathed his own knife, leaving a trace of blood on the edge of his yellow robe."You have defiled my honor!"Stilgar cried."This is neutral  "  "Shut up!"Idaho glared at the shocked Naib."You wear a collar, Stilgar!"It was one of the three most deadly insults which could be directed at a Fremen.Stilgar's face went pale."You are a servant," Idaho said."You've sold Fremen for their water. "This was the second most deadly insult, the one which had destroyed the original Jacurutu.Stilgar ground his teeth, put a hand on his crysknife.The aide stepped back away from the body in the doorway.Turning his back on the Naib, Idaho stepped into the door, taking the narrow opening beside Javid's body and speaking without turning, delivered the third insult."You have no immortality, Stilgar.None of your descendants carry your blood!""Where do you go now, mentat?"Stilgar called as Idaho continued leaving the room.Stilgar's voice was as cold as a wind from the poles."To find Jacurutu," Idaho said, still not turning.Stilgar drew his knife."Perhaps I can help you. "Idaho was at the outer lip of the passage now.Without stopping, he said: "If you'd help me with your knife, water thief, please do it in my back.That's the fitting way for one who wears the collar of a demon. "With two leaping strides Stilgar crossed the room, stepped on Javid's body and caught Idaho in the outer passage.One gnarled hand jerked Idaho around and to a stop.Stilgar confronted Idaho with bared teeth and a drawn knife.Such was his rage that Stilgar did not even see the curious smile on Idaho's face."Draw your knife, mentat scum!"Stilgar roared.Idaho laughed.He cuffed Stilgar sharply   left hand, right hand   two stinging slaps to the head.With an incoherent screech, Stilgar drove his knife into Idaho's abdomen, striking upward through the diaphragm into the heart.Idaho sagged onto the blade, grinned up at Stilgar, whose rage dissolved into sudden icy shock."Two deaths for the Atreides," Idaho husked."The second for no better reason than the first. "He lurched sideways, collapsed to the stone floor on his face.Blood spread out from his wound.Stilgar stared down past his dripping knife at the body of Idaho, took a deep, trembling breath.Javid lay dead behind him.And the consort of Alia, the Womb of Heaven, lay dead at Stilgar's own hands.It might be argued that a Naib had but protected the honor of his name, avenging the threat to his promised neutrality.But this dead man was Duncan Idaho.No matter the arguments available, no matter the "extenuating circumstances," nothing could erase such an act.Even were Alia to approve privately, she would be forced to respond publicly in revenge.She was, after all, Fremen.To rule Fremen, she could be nothing else, not even to the smallest degree.Only then did it occur to Stilgar that this situation was precisely what Idaho had intended to buy with his "second death. "Stilgar looked up, saw the shocked face of Harah, his second wife, peering at him in an enclosing throng.Everywhere Stilgar turned there were faces with identical expressions: shock and an understanding of the consequences.Slowly Stilgar drew himself erect, wiped the blade on his sleeve and sheathed it.Speaking to the faces, his tone casual, he said: "Those who'll go with me should pack at once.Send men to summon worms. ""Where will you go, Stilgar?"Harah asked."Into the desert. ""I will go with you," she said."Of course you'll go with me.All of my wives will go with me.And Ghanima.Get her, Harah.At once. ""Yes, Stilgar...at once. "She hesitated."And Irulan?""If she wishes. ""Yes, husband. "Still she hesitated."You take Ghani as hostage?""Hostage?"He was genuinely startled by the thought."Woman... "He touched Idaho's body softly with a toe."If this mentat was right.I'm Ghani's only hope. "And he remembered then Leto's warning: "Beware of Alia.You must take Ghani and flee. "= = = = = =   After the Fremen, all Planetologists see life as expressions of energy and look for the overriding relationships.In small pieces, bits and parcels which grow into general understanding, the Fremen racial wisdom is translated into a new certainty.The thing Fremen have as a people, any people can have.They need but develop a sense for energy relationships.They need but observe that energy soaks up the patterns of things and builds with those patterns.The Arrakeen Catastrophe, After Harq al Ada   It was Tuek's Sietch on the inner lip of False Wall.Halleck stood in the shadow of the rock buttress which shielded the high entrance to the sietch, waiting for those inside to decide whether they would shelter him.He turned his gaze outward to the northern desert and then upward to the grey blue morning sky.The smugglers here had been astonished to learn that he, an off worlder, had captured a worm and ridden it.But Halleck had been equally astonished at their reaction.The thing was simple for an agile man who'd seen it done many times.Halleck returned his attention to the desert, the silver desert of shining rocks and grey green fields where water had worked its magic.All of this struck him suddenly as an enormously fragile containment of energy, of life   everything threatened by an abrupt shift in the pattern of change.He knew the source of this reaction.It was the bustling scene on the desert floor below him.Containers of dead sandtrout were being trundled into the sietch for distillation and recovery of their water.There were thousands of the creatures.They had come to an outpouring of water.And it was this outpouring which had set Halleck's mind racing.Halleck stared downward across the sietch fields and the qanat boundary which no longer flowed with precious water.He had seen the holes in the qanat's stone walls, the rending of the rock liner which had spilled water into the sand.What had made those holes?Some stretched along twenty meters of the qanat's most vulnerable sections, in places where soft sand led outward into water absorbing depressions.It was those depressions which had swarmed with sandtrout.The children of the sietch were killing them and capturing them.Repair teams worked on the shattered walls of the qanat.Others carried minims of irrigation water to the most needy plants.The water source in the gigantic cistern beneath Tuek's windtrap had been closed off, preventing the flow into the shattered qanat.The sun powered pumps had been disconnected.The irrigation water came from dwindling pools at the bottom of the qanat and, laboriously, from the cistern within the sietch.The metal frame of the doorseal behind Halleck crackled in the growing warmth of the day.As though the sound moved his eyes, Halleck found his gaze drawn to the farthest curve of the qanat, to the place where water had reached most impudently into the desert.The garden hopeful planners of the sietch had planted a special tree there and it was doomed unless the water flow could be restored soon.Halleck stared at the silly, trailing plumage of a willow tree there shredded by sand and wind.For him, that tree symbolized the new reality for himself and for Arrakis.Both of us are alien here.They were taking a long time over their decision within the sietch, but they could use good fighting men.Smugglers always needed good men.Halleck had no illusions about them, though.The smugglers of this age were not the smugglers who'd sheltered him so many years ago when he'd fled the dissolution of his Duke's fief.No, these were a new breed, quick to seek profit.Again he focused on the silly willow.It came to Halleck then that the stormwinds of his new reality might shred these smugglers and all of their friends.It might destroy Stilgar with his fragile neutrality and take with him all of the tribes who remained loyal to Alia.They'd all become colonial peoples.Halleck had seen it happen before, knowing the bitter taste of it on his own homeworld.He saw it clearly, recalling the mannerisms of the city Fremen, the pattern of the suburbs, and the unmistakable ways of the rural sietch which rubbed off even on this smugglers' hideaway.The rural districts were colonies of the urban centers.They'd learned how to wear a padded yoke, led into it by their greed if not their superstitions.Even here, especially here, the people had the attitude of a subject population, not the attitude of free men.They were defensive, concealing, evasive.Any manifestation of authority was subject to resentment   any authority: the Regency's, Stilgar's, their own Council...I can't trust them, Halleck thought.He could only use them and nurture their distrust of others.It was sad.Gone was the old give and take of free men.The old ways had been reduced to ritual words, their origins lost to memory.Alia had done her work well, punishing opposition and rewarding assistance, shifting the Imperial forces in random fashion, concealing the major elements of her Imperial power.The spies!Gods below, the spies she must have!Halleck could almost see the deadly rhythm of movement and countermovement by which Alia hoped to keep her opposition off balance.If the Fremen remain dormant, she'll win, he thought.The doorseal behind him crackled as it was opened.A sietch attendant named Melides emerged.He was a short man with a gourd like body which dwindled into spindly legs whose ugliness was only accented by a stillsuit."You have been accepted," Melides said.And Halleck heard the sly dissimulation in the man's voice.What that voice revealed told Halleck there was sanctuary here for only a limited time.Just until I can steal one of their 'thopters, he thought."My gratitude to your Council," he said.And he thought of Esmar Tuek, for whom this sietch had been named.Esmar, long dead of someone's treachery, would have slit the throat of this Melides on sight.= = = = = =   Any path which narrows future possibilities

question at the ceiling of her small audience chamber, a room she could cross in ten paces one way and fifteen the other.It had two tall and narrow windows which looked out across the Arrakeen rooftops at the Shield Wall.It was almost noon.The sun burned down into the pan upon which the city had been built.Alia lowered her gaze to Buer Agarves, the former Tabrite and now aide to Zia who directed the Temple guards.Agarves had brought the news that Javid and Idaho were dead.A mob of sycophants, aides and guards had come in with him and more crowded the areaway outside, revealing that they already knew Agarves's message.Bad news traveled fast on Arrakis.He was a small man, this Agarves, with a round face for a Fremen, almost infantile in its roundness.He was one of the new breed who had gone to water fatness.Alia saw him as though he had been split into two images: one with a serious face and opaque indigo eyes, a worried expression around the mouth, the other image sensuous and vulnerable, excitingly vulnerable.She especially liked the thickness of his lips.Although it was not yet noon, Alia felt something in the shocked silence around her that spoke of sunset.Idaho should've died at sunset, she told herself."How is it, Buer, that you're the bearer of this news?"she asked, noting the watchful quickness which came into his expression,  Agarves tried to swallow, spoke in a hoarse voice hardly more than a whisper."I went with Javid, you recall?And when...Stilgar sent me to you, he said for me to tell you that I carried his final obedience. ""Final obedience," she echoed."What'd he mean by that?""I don't know, Lady Alia," he pleaded."Explain to me again what you saw," she ordered, and she wondered at how cold her skin felt."I saw... "He bobbed his head nervously, looked at the floor in front of Alia."I saw the Holy Consort dead upon the floor of the central passage, and Javid lay dead nearby in a side passage.The women already were preparing them for Huanui. ""And Stilgar summoned you to this scene?""That is true, My Lady.Stilgar summoned me.He sent Modibo, the Bent One, his messenger in sietch.Modibo gave me no warning.He merely told me Stilgar wanted me. ""And you saw my husband's body there on the floor?"He met her eyes with a darting glance, returned his attention once more to the floor in front of her before nodding."Yes, My Lady.And Javid dead nearby.Stilgar told me...told me that the Holy Consort had slain Javid. ""And my husband, you say Stilgar  "  "He said it to me with his own mouth, My Lady.Stilgar said he had done this.He said the Holy Consort provoked him to rage. ""Rage," Alia repeated."How was that done?""He didn't say.No one said.I asked and no one said. ""And that's when you were sent to me with this news?""Yes, My Lady. ""Was there nothing you could do?"Agarves wet his lips with his tongue, then: "Stilgar commanded, My Lady.It was his sietch. ""I see.And you always obeyed Stilgar. ""I always did.My Lady, until he freed me from my bond. ""When you were sent to my service, you mean?""I obey only you now, My Lady. ""Is that right?Tell me, Buer, if I commanded you to slay Stilgar, your old Naib, would you do it?"He met her gaze with a growing firmness."If you commanded it, My Lady. ""I do command it.Have you any idea where he's gone?""Into the desert; that's all I know, My Lady. ""How many men did he take?""Perhaps half the effectives. ""And Ghanima and Irulan with him!""Yes, My Lady.Those who left are burdened with their women, their children and their baggage.Stilgar gave everyone a choice   go with him or be freed of their bond.Many chose to be freed.They will select a new Naib. ""I'll select their new Naib!And it'll be you, Buer Agarves, on the day you bring me Stilgar's head. "Agarves could accept selection by battle.It was a Fremen way.He said: "As you command, My Lady.What forces may I  "  "See Zia.I can't give you many 'thopters for the search.They're needed elsewhere.But you'll have enough fighting men.Stilgar has defamed his honor.Many will serve with you gladly. ""I'll get about it, then, My Lady. ""Wait!"She studied him a moment, reviewing whom she could send to watch over this vulnerable infant.He would need close watching until he'd proved himself.Zia would know whom to send."Am I not dismissed, My Lady?""You are not dismissed.I must consult you privately and at length on your plans to take Stilgar. "She put a hand to her face."I'll not grieve until you've exacted my revenge.Give me a few minutes to compose myself. "She lowered her hand."One of my attendants will show you the way. "She gave a subtle hand signal to one of her attendants, whispered to Shalus, her new Dame of Chamber: "Have him washed and perfumed before you bring him.He smells of worm. ""Yes, mistress. "Alia turned then, feigning the grief she did not feel, and fled to her private chambers.There, in her bedroom, she slammed the door into its tracks, cursed and stamped her foot.Damn that Duncan!Why?Why?Why?She sensed a deliberate provocation from Idaho.He'd slain Javid and provoked Stilgar.It said he knew about Javid.The whole thing must be taken as a message from Duncan Idaho, a final gesture.Again she stamped her foot and again, raging across the bedchamber.Damn him!Damn him!Damn him!Stilgar gone over to the rebels and Ghanima with him.Irulan, too.Damn them all!Her stamping foot encountered a painful obstacle, descending onto metal.Pain brought a cry from her and she peered down, finding that she'd bruised her foot on a metal buckle.She snatched it up, stood frozen at the sight of it in her hand.It was an old buckle, one of the silver and platinum originals from Caladan awarded originally by the Duke Leto Atreides I to his swordmaster, Duncan Idaho.She'd seen Duncan wear it many times.And he'd discarded it here.Alia's fingers clutched convulsively on the buckle.Idaho had left it here when...when...Tears sprang from her eyes, forced out against the great Fremen conditioning.Her mouth drew down into a frozen grimace and she sensed the old battle begin within her skull, reaching out to her fingertips, to her toes.She felt that she had become two people.One looked upon these fleshly contortions with astonishment.The other sought submission to an enormous pain spreading in her chest.The tears flowed freely from her eyes now, and the Astonished One within her demanded querulously: "Who cries?Who is it that cries?Who is crying now?"But nothing stopped the tears, and she felt the painfulness which flamed through her breast as it moved her flesh and hurled her onto the bed.Still something demanded out of that profound astonishment: "Who cries?Who is that... "= = = = = =   By these acts Leto II removed himself from the evolutionary succession.He did it with a deliberate cutting action, saying: "To be independent is to be removed. "Both twins saw beyond the needs of memory as a measuring process, that is, a way of determining their distance from their human origins.But it was left to Leto II to do the audacious thing, recognizing that a real creation is independent of its creator.He refused to reenact the evolutionary sequence, saying, "That, too, takes me farther and farther from humanity. "He saw the implications in this: that there can be no truly closed systems in life.The Holy Metamorphosis, by Harq al Ada   There were birds thriving on the insect life which teemed in the damp sand beyond the broken qanat: parrots, magpies, jays.This had been a djedida, the last of the new towns, built on a foundation of exposed basalt.It was abandoned now.Ghanima, using the morning hours to study the area beyond the original plantings of the abandoned sietch, detected movement and saw a banded gecko lizard.There'd been a gila woodpecker earlier, nesting in a mud wall of the djedida.She thought of it as a sietch, but it was really a collection of low walls made of stabilized mud brick surrounded by plantings to hold back the dunes.It lay within the Tanzerouft, six hundred kilometers south of Sihaya Ridge.Without human hands to maintain it, the sietch already was beginning to melt back into the desert, its walls eroded by sandblast winds, its plants dying, its plantation area cracked by the burning sun.Yet the sand beyond the shattered qanat remained damp, attesting to the fact that the squat bulk of the windtrap still functioned.In the months since their flight from Tabr the fugitives had sampled the protection of several such places made uninhabitable by the Desert Demon.Ghanima didn't believe in the Desert Demon, although there was no denying the visible evidence of the qanat's destruction.Occasionally they had word from the northern settlements through encounters with rebel spice hunters.A few 'thopters   some said no more than six   carried out search flights seeking Stilgar, but Arrakis was large and its desert was friendly to the fugitives.Reportedly there was a search and destroy force charged with finding Stilgar's band, but the force which was led by the former Tabrite Buer Agarves had other duties and often returned to Arrakeen.The rebels said there was little fighting between their men and the troops of Alia.Random depredations of the Desert Demon made Home Guard duty the first concern of Alia and the Naibs.Even the smugglers had been hit, but they were said to be scouring the desert for Stilgar, wanting the price on his head.Stilgar had brought his band into the djedida just before dark the previous day, following the unerring moisture sense of his old Fremen nose.He'd promised they would head south for the palmyries soon, but refused to put a date on the move.Although he carried a price on his head which once would have bought a planet, Stilgar seemed the happiest and most carefree of men."This is a good place for us," he'd said, pointing out that the windtrap still functioned."Our friends have left us some water. "They were a small band now, sixty people in all.The old, the sick, and the very young had been filtered south into the palmyries, absorbed there by trusted families.Only the toughest remained, and they had many friends to the north and the south.Ghanima wondered why Stilgar refused to discuss what was happening to the planet.Couldn't he see it?As qanats were shattered, Fremen pulled back to the northern and southern lines which once had marked the extent of their holdings.This movement could only signal what must be happening to the Empire.One condition was the mirror of the other.Ghanima ran a hand under the collar of her stillsuit and resealed it.Despite her worries she felt remarkably free here.The inner lives no longer plagued her, although she sometimes felt their memories inserted into her consciousness.She knew from those memories what this desert had been once, before the work of the ecological transformation.It had been drier, for one thing.That unrepaired windtrap still functioned because it processed moist air.Many creatures which once had shunned this desert ventured to live here now.Many in the band remarked how the daylight owls proliferated.Even now, Ghanima could see antbirds.They jigged and danced alone the insect lines which swarmed in the damp sand at the end of the shattered qanat!Few badgers were to be seen out here, but there were kangaroo mice in uncounted numbers.Superstitious fear ruled the new Fremen, and Stilgar was no better than the rest.This djedida had been given back to the desert after its qanat had been shattered a fifth time in eleven months.Four times they'd repaired the ravages of the Desert Demon, then they'd no longer had the surplus water to risk another loss.It was the same all through the djedidas and in many of the old sietches.Eight out of nine new settlements had been abandoned.Many of the old sietch communities were more crowded than they had ever been before.And while the desert entered this new phase, Fremen reverted to their old ways.They saw omens in everything.Were worms increasingly scarce except in the Tanzerouft?It was the judgment of Shai Hulud!And dead worms had been seen with nothing to say why they died.They went back to desert dust swiftly after death, but those crumbling hulks which Fremen chanced upon filled the observers with terror.Stilgar's band had encountered such a hulk the previous month and it had taken four days for them to shake off the feeling of evil.The thing had reeked of sour and poisonous putrefaction.Its moldering hulk had been found sitting on top of a giant spiceblow, the spice mostly ruined.Ghanima turned from observing the qanat and looked back at the djedida.Directly in front of her lay a broken wall which once had protected a mushtamal, a small garden annex.She'd explored the place with a firm dependence upon her own curiosity and had found a store of flat, unleavened spicebread in a stone box.Stilgar had destroyed it, saying: "Fremen would never leave good food behind them. "Ghanima had suspected he was mistaken, but it hadn't been worth the argument or the risk.Fremen were changing.Once they'd moved freely across the bled, drawn by natural needs: water, spice, trade.Animal activities had been their alarm clocks.But animals moved to strange new rhythms now while most Fremen huddled close in their old cave warrens within the shadow of the northern Shield Wall.Spice hunters in the Tanzerouft were rare, and only Stilgar's band moved in the old ways.She trusted Stilgar and his fear of Alia.Irulan reinforced his arguments now, reverting to odd Bene Gesserit musings.But on faraway Salusa, Farad'n still lived.Someday there would have to be a reckoning.Ghanima looked up at the grey silver morning sky, questing in her mind.Where was help to be found?Where was there someone to listen when she revealed what she saw happening all around them?The Lady Jessica stayed on Salusa, if the reports were to be believed.And Alia was a creature on a pedestal, involved only in being colossal while she drifted farther and farther from reality.Gurney Halleck was nowhere to be found, although he was reported seen everywhere.The Preacher had gone into hiding, his heretical rantings only a fading memory.And Stilgar.She looked across the broken wall to where Stilgar was helping repair the cistern.Stilgar reveled in his role as the will o' the desert, the price upon his head growing monthly.Nothing made sense anymore.Nothing.Who was this Desert Demon, this creature able to destroy qanats as though they were false idols to be toppled into the sand?Was it a rogue worm?Was it a third force in rebellion   many people?No one believed it was a worm.The water would kill any worm venturing against a qanat.Many Fremen believed the Desert Demon was actually a revolutionary band bent on overthrowing Alia's Mahdinate and restoring Arrakis to its old ways.Those who believed this said it would be a good thing.Get rid of that greedy apostolic succession which did little else than uphold its own mediocrity.Get back to the true religion which Muad'Dib had espoused.A deep sigh shook Ghanima.Oh, Leto, she thought.I'm almost glad you didn't live to see these days.I'd join you myself, but I've a knife yet unblooded.Alia and Farad'n.Farad'n and Alia.The Old Baron's her demon, and that can't be permitted.Harah came out of the djedida, approaching Ghanima with a steady sand swallowing pace.Harah stopped in front of Ghanima, demanded, "What do you alone out here?""This is a strange place, Harah.We should leave. ""Stilgar waits to meet someone here. ""Oh?He didn't tell me that. ""Why should he tell you everything?Maku?"Harah slapped the water pouch which bulged the front of Ghanima's robe."Are you a grown woman to be pregnant?""I've been pregnant so many times there's no counting them," Ghanima said."Don't play those adult child games with me!"Harah took a backward step at the venom in Ghanima's voice."You're a band of stupids," Ghanima said, waving her hand to encompass the djedida and the activities of Stilgar and his people."I should never have come with you. ""You'd be dead by now if you hadn't. ""Perhaps.But you don't see what's right in front of your faces!Who is it that Stilgar waits to meet here?""Buer Agarves. "Ghanima stared at her."He is being brought here secretly by friends from Red Chasm Sietch," Harah explained."Alia's little plaything?""He is being brought under blindfold. ""Does Stilgar believe that?""Buer asked for the parley.He agreed to all of our terms. ""Why wasn't I told about this?""Stilgar knew you would argue against it. ""Argue against...This is madness!"Harah scowled."Don't forget that Buer is.
