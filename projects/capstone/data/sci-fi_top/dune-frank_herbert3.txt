The Duke turned to Hawat.Set up another command post for intelligence and communications on this floor, Thufir.When you have them ready, Ill want to see you.Hawat arose, glanced around the room as though seeking support.He turned away, led the procession out of the room.The others moved hurriedly, scraping their chairs on the floor, balling up in little knots of confusion.It ended in confusion, Paul thought, staring at the backs of the last men to leave.Always before, Staff had ended on an incisive air.This meeting had just seemed to trickle out, worn down by its own inadequacies, and with an argument to top it off.For the first time, Paul allowed himself to think about the real possibility of defeat  not thinking about it out of fear or because of warnings such as that of the old Reverend Mother, but facing up to it because of his own assessment of the situation.My father is desperate, he thought.Things arent going well for us at all.And Hawat  Paul recalled how the old Mentat had acted during the conference  subtle hesitations, signs of unrest.Hawat was deeply troubled by something.Best you remain here the rest of the night, Son, the Duke said.Itll be dawn soon, anyway.Ill inform your mother.He got to his feet, slowly, stiffly.Why dont you pull a few of these chairs together and stretch out on them for some rest.Im not very tired, sir.As you will.The Duke folded his hands behind him, began pacing up and down the length of the table.Like a caged animal, Paul thought.Are you going to discuss the traitor possibility with Hawat?Paul asked.The Duke stopped across from his son, spoke to the dark windows.Weve discussed the possibility many times.The old woman seemed so sure of herself, Paul said.And the message Mother  Precautions have been taken, the Duke said.He looked around the room, and Paul marked the hunted wildness in his fathers eyes.Remain here.There are some things about the command posts I want to discuss with Thufir.He turned, strode out of the room, nodding shortly to the door guards.Paul stared at the place where his father had stood.The space had been empty even before the Duke left the room.And he recalled the old womans warning:  for the father, nothing.On that first day when MuadDib rode through the streets of Arrakeen with his family, some of the people along the way recalled the legends and the prophecy and they ventured to shout: Mahdi!But their shout was more a question than a statement, for as yet they could only hope he was the one foretold as the Lisan al Gaib, the Voice from the Outer World.Their attention was focused, too, on the mother, because they had heard she was a Bene Gesserit and it was obvious to them that she was like the other Lisan al Gaib.from Manual of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    The Duke found Thufir Hawat alone in the corner room to which a guard directed him.There was the sound of men setting up communications equipment in an adjoining room, but this place was fairly quiet.The Duke glanced around as Hawat arose from a paper cluttered table.It was a green walled enclosure with, in addition to the table, three suspensor chairs from which the Harkonnen H had been hastily removed, leaving an imperfect color patch.The chairs are liberated but quite safe, Hawat said.Where is Paul, Sire?I left him in the conference room.Im hoping hell get some rest without me there to distract him.Hawat nodded, crossed to the door to the adjoining room, closed it, shutting off the noise of static and electronic sparking.Thufir, Leto said, the Imperial and Harkonnen stockpiles of spice attract my attention.MLord?The Duke pursed his lips.Storehouses are susceptible to destruction.He raised a hand as Hawat started to speak.Ignore the Emperors hoard.Hed secretly enjoy it if the Harkonnens were embarrassed.And can the Baron object if something is destroyed which he cannot openly admit that he has?Hawat shook his head.Weve few men to spare, Sire.Use some of Idahos men.And perhaps some of the Fremen would enjoy a trip off planet.A raid on Giedi Prime  there are tactical advantages to such a diversion, Thufir.As you say, my Lord.Hawat turned away, and the Duke saw evidence of nervousness in the old man, thought: Perhaps he suspects I distrust him.He must know Ive private reports of traitors.Well  best quiet his fears immediately.Thufir, he said, since youre one of the few I can trust completely, theres another matter bears discussion.We both know how constant a watch we must keep to prevent traitors from infiltrating our forces  but I have two new reports.Hawat turned, stared at him.And Leto repeated the stories Paul had brought.Instead of bringing on the intense Mentat concentration, the reports only increased Hawats agitation.Leto studied the old man and, presently, said: Youve been holding something back, old friend.I shouldve suspected when you were so nervous during Staff.What is it that was too hot to dump in front of the full conference?Hawats sapho stained lips were pulled into a prim, straight line with tiny wrinkles radiating into them.They maintained their wrinkled stiffness as he said: My Lord, I dont quite know how to broach this.Weve suffered many a scar for each other, Thufir, the Duke said.You know you can broach any subject with me.Hawat continued to stare at him, thinking: This is how I like him best.This is the man of honor who deserves every bit of my loyalty and service.Why must I hurt him?Well?Leto demanded.Hawat shrugged.Its a scrap of a note.We took it from a Harkonnen courier.The note was intended for an agent named Pardee.Weve good reason to believe Pardee was top man in the Harkonnen underground here.The note  its a thing that could have great consequence or no consequence.Its susceptible to various interpretations.Whats the delicate content of this note?Scrap of a note, my Lord.Incomplete.It was on minimic film with the usual destruction capsule attached.We stopped the acid action just short of full erasure, leaving only a fragment.The fragment, however, is extremely suggestive.Yes?Hawat rubbed at his lips.It says:  eto will never suspect, and when the blow falls on him from a beloved hand, its source alone should be enough to destroy him.The note was under the Barons own seal and Ive authenticated the seal.Your suspicion is obvious, the Duke said and his voice was suddenly cold.Id sooner cut off my arms than hurt you, Hawat said.My Lord, what if   The Lady Jessica, Leto said, and he felt anger consuming him.Couldnt you wring the facts out of this Pardee?Unfortunately, Pardee no longer was among the living when we intercepted the courier.The courier, Im certain, did not know what he carried.I see.Leto shook his head, thinking: What a slimy piece of business.There cant be anything in it.I know my woman.My Lord, if  No!the Duke barked.Theres a mistake here that  We cannot ignore it, my Lord.Shes been with me for sixteen years!Thereve been countless opportunities for  You yourself investigated the school and the woman!Hawat spoke bitterly: Things have been known to escape me.Its impossible, I tell you!The Harkonnens want to destroy the Atreides line  meaning Paul, too.Theyve already tried once.Could a woman conspire against her own son?Perhaps she doesnt conspire against her son.And yesterdays attempt couldve been a clever sham.It couldnt have been sham.Sire, she isnt supposed to know her parentage, but what if she does know?What if she were an orphan, say, orphaned by an Atreides?Shed have moved long before now.Poison in my drink  a stiletto at night.Who has had better opportunity?The Harkonnens mean to destroy you, my Lord.Their intent is not just to kill.Theres a range of fine distinctions in kanly.This could be a work of art among vendettas.The Dukes shoulders slumped.He closed his eyes, looking old and tired.It cannot be, he thought.The woman has opened her heart to me.What better way to destroy me than to sow suspicion of the woman I love?he asked.An interpretation Ive considered, Hawat said.Still   The Duke opened his eyes, stared at Hawat, thinking: Let him be suspicious.Suspicion is his trade, not mine.Perhaps if I appear to believe this, that will make another man careless.What do you suggest?the Duke whispered.For now, constant surveillance, my Lord.She should be watched at all times.I will see its done unobtrusively.Idaho would be the ideal choice for the job.Perhaps in a week or so we can bring him back.Theres a young man weve been training in Idahos troop who might be ideal to send to the Fremen as a replacement.Hes gifted in diplomacy.Dont jeopardize our foothold with the Fremen.Of course not, Sire.And what about Paul?Perhaps we could alert Dr Yueh.Leto turned his back on Hawat.I leave it in your hands.I shall use discretion, my Lord.At least I can count on that, Leto thought.And he said: I will take a walk.If you need me, Ill be within the perimeter.The guard can  My Lord, before you go, Ive a filmclip you should read.Its a first approximation analysis on the Fremen religion.Youll recall you asked me to report on it.The Duke paused, spoke without turning.Will it not wait?Of course, my Lord.You asked what they were shouting, though.It was Mahdi!They directed the term at the young master.When they  At Paul?Yes, my Lord.Theyve a legend here, a prophecy, that a leader will come to them, child of a Bene Gesserit, to lead them to true freedom.It follows the familiar messiah pattern.They think Paul is this  this   They only hope, my Lord.Hawat extended a filmclip capsule.The Duke accepted it, thrust it into a pocket.Ill look at it later.Certainly, my Lord.Right now, I need time to  think.Yes, my Lord.The Duke took a deep, sighing breath, strode out the door.He turned to his right down the hall, began walking, hands behind his back, paying little attention to where he was.There were corridors and stairs and balconies and halls  people who saluted and stood aside for him.In time he came back to the conference room, found it dark and Paul asleep on the table with a guards robe thrown over him and a ditty pack for a pillow.The Duke walked softly down the length of the room and onto the balcony overlooking the landing field.A guard at the corner of the balcony, recognizing the Duke by the dim reflection of lights from the field, snapped to attention.At ease, the Duke murmured.He leaned against the cold metal of the balcony rail.A predawn hush had come over the desert basin.He looked up.Straight overhead, the stars were a sequin shawl flung over blue black.Low on the southern horizon, the nights second moon peered through a thin dust haze  an unbelieving moon that looked at him with a cynical light.As the Duke watched, the moon dipped beneath the Shield Wall cliffs, frosting them, and in the sudden intensity of darkness, he experienced a chill.He shivered.Anger shot through him.The Harkonnens have hindered and hounded and hunted me for the last time, he thought.They are dung heaps with village provost minds!Here I make my stand!And he thought with a touch of sadness: I must rule with eye and claw  as the hawk among lesser birds.Unconsciously, his hand brushed the hawk emblem on his tunic.To the east, the night grew a faggot of luminous gray, then seashell opalescence that dimmed the stars.There came the long, bell tolling movement of dawn striking across a broken horizon.It was a scene of such beauty it caught all his attention.Some things beggar likeness, he thought.He had never imagined anything here could be as beautiful as that shattered red horizon and the purple and ochre cliffs.Beyond the landing field where the nights faint dew had touched life into the hurried seeds of Arrakis, he saw great puddles of red blooms and, running through them, an articulate tread of violet  like giant footsteps.Its a beautiful morning, Sire, the guard said.Yes, it is.The Duke nodded, thinking: Perhaps this planet could grow on one.Perhaps it could become a good home for my son.Then he saw the human figures moving into the flower fields, sweeping them with strange scythe like devices  dew gatherers.Water so precious here that even the dew must be collected.And it could be a hideous place, the Duke thought.There is probably no more terrible instant of enlightenment than the one in which you discover your father is a man  with human flesh.from Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    The Duke said: Paul, Im doing a hateful thing, but I must.He stood beside the portable poison snooper that had been brought into the conference room for their breakfast.The things sensor arms hung limply over the table, reminding Paul of some weird insect newly dead.The Dukes attention was directed out the windows at the landing field and its roiling of dust against the morning sky.Paul had a viewer in front of him containing a short filmclip on Fremen religious practices.The clip had been compiled by one of Hawats experts and Paul found himself disturbed by the references to himself.Mahdi!Lisan al Gaib!He could close his eyes and recall the shouts of the crowds.So that is what they hope, he thought.And he remembered what the old Reverend Mother had said: Kwisatz Haderach.The memories touched his feelings of terrible purpose, shading this strange world with sensations of familiarity that he could not understand.A hateful thing, the Duke said.What do you mean, sir?Leto turned, looked down at his son.Because the Harkonnens think to trick me by making me distrust your mother.They dont know that Id sooner distrust myself.I dont understand, sir.Again, Leto looked out the windows.The white sun was well up into its morning quadrant.Milky light picked out a boiling of dust clouds that spilled over into the blind canyons interfingering the Shield Wall.Slowly, speaking in a low voice to contain his anger, the Duke explained to Paul about the mysterious note.You might just as well mistrust me, Paul said.They have to think theyve succeeded, the Duke said.They must think me this much of a fool.It must look real.Even your mother may not know the sham.But, sir!Why?Your mothers response must not be an act.Oh, shes capable of a supreme act  but too much rides on this.I hope to smoke out a traitor.It must seem that Ive been completely cozened.She must be hurt this way that she does not suffer greater hurt.Why do you tell me, Father!Maybe Ill give it away.Theyll not watch you in this thing, the Duke said.Youll keep the secret.You must.He walked to the windows, spoke without turning.This way, if anything should happen to me, you can tell her the truth  that I never doubted her, not for the smallest instant.I should want her to know this.Paul recognized the death thoughts in his fathers words, spoke quickly: Nothings going to happen to you, sir.The  Be silent, Son.Paul stared at his fathers back, seeing the fatigue in the angle of the neck, in the line of the shoulders, in the slow movements.Youre just tired, Father.I am tired, the Duke agreed.Im morally tired.The melancholy degeneration of the Great Houses has afflicted me at last, perhaps.And we were such strong people once.Paul spoke in quick anger: Our House hasnt degenerated!Hasnt it?The Duke turned, faced his son, revealing dark circles beneath hard eyes, a cynical twist of mouth.I should wed your mother, make her my Duchess.Yet  my unwedded state gives some Houses hope they may yet ally with me through their marriageable daughters.He shrugged.So, I   Mother has explained this to me.Nothing wins more loyalty for a leader than an air of bravura, the Duke said.I, therefore, cultivate an air of bravura.You lead well, Paul protested.You govern well.Men follow you willingly and love you.My propaganda corps is one of the finest, the Duke said.Again, he turned to stare out at the basin.Theres greater possibility for us here on Arrakis than the Imperium could ever suspect.Yet sometimes I think itd have been better if wed run for it, gone renegade.Sometimes I wish we could sink back into anonymity among the people, become less exposed to   Father!Yes, I am tired, the Duke said.Did you know were using spice residue as raw material and already have our own factory to manufacture filmbase?Sir?We mustnt run short of filmbase, the Duke said.Else, how could we flood village and city with our information?The people must learn how well I govern them.How would they know if we didnt tell them?You should get some rest, Paul said.Again, the Duke faced his son.Arrakis has another advantage I almost forgot to mention.Spice is in everything here.You breathe it and eat it in almost everything.And I find that this imparts a certain natural immunity to some of the most common poisons of the Assassins Handbook.And the need to watch every drop of water puts all food production  yeast culture, hydroponics, chemavit, everything  under the strictest surveillance.We cannot kill off large segments of our population with poison  and we cannot be attacked this way, either.Arrakis makes us moral and ethical.Paul started to speak, but the Duke cut him off, saying: I have to have someone I can say these things to, Son.He sighed, glanced back at the dry landscape where even the flowers were gone now  trampled by the dew gatherers, wilted under the early sun.On Caladan, we ruled with sea and air power, the Duke said.Here, we must scrabble for desert power.This is your inheritance, Paul.What is to become of you if anything happens to me?Youll not be a renegade House, but a guerrilla House  running, hunted.Paul groped for words, could find nothing to say.He had never seen his father this despondent.To hold Arrakis, the Duke said, one is faced with decisions that may cost one his self respect.He pointed out the window to the Atreides green and black banner hanging limply from a staff at the edge of the landing field.That honorable banner could come to mean many evil things.Paul swallowed in a dry throat.His fathers words carried futility, a sense of fatalism that left the boy with an empty feeling in his chest.The Duke took an antifatigue tablet from a pocket, gulped it dry.Power and fear, he said.The tools of statecraft.I must order new emphasis on guerrilla training for you.That filmclip there  they call you Mahdi  Lisan al Gaib  as a last resort, you might capitalize on that.Paul stared at his father, watching the shoulders straighten as the tablet did its work, but remembering the words of fear and doubt.Whats keeping that ecologist?the Duke muttered.I told Thufir to have him here early.My father, the Padishah Emperor, took me by the hand one day and I sensed in the ways my mother had taught me that he was disturbed.He led me down the Hall of Portraits to the ego likeness of the Duke Leto Atreides.I marked the strong resemblance between them  my father and this man in the portrait  both with thin, elegant faces and sharp features dominated by cold eyes.Princess daughter, my father said, I would that youd been older when it came time for this man to choose a woman.My father was 71 at the time and looking no older than the man in the portrait, and I was but 14, yet I remember deducing in that instant that my father secretly wished the Duke had been his son, and disliked the political necessities that made them enemies.In My Fathers House by the Princess Irulan    His first encounter with the people he had been ordered to betray left Dr Kynes shaken.He prided himself on being a scientist to whom legends were merely interesting clues, pointing toward cultural roots.Yet the boy fitted the ancient prophecy so precisely.He had the questing eyes, and the air of reserved candor.Of course, the prophecy left certain latitude as to whether the Mother Goddess would bring the Messiah with her or produce Him on the scene.Still, there was this odd correspondence between prediction and persons.They met in midmorning outside the Arrakeen landing fields administration building.An unmarked ornithopter squatted nearby, humming softly on standby like a somnolent insect.An Atreides guard stood beside it with bared sword and the faint air distortion of a shield around him.Kynes sneered at the shield pattern, thinking: Arrakis has a surprise for them there!The planetologist raised a hand, signaled for his Fremen guard to fall back.He strode on ahead toward the buildings entrance  the dark hole in plastic coated rock.So exposed, that monolithic building, he thought.So much less suitable than a cave.Movement within the entrance caught his attention.He stopped, taking the moment to adjust his robe and the set of his stillsuit at the left shoulder.The entrance doors swung wide.Atreides guards emerged swiftly, all of them heavily armed  slow pellet stunners, swords and shields.Behind them came a tall man, hawk faced, dark of skin and hair.He wore a jubba cloak with Atreides crest at the breast, and wore it in a way that betrayed his unfamiliarity with the garment.It clung to the legs of his stillsuit on one side.It lacked a free swinging, striding rhythm.Beside the man walked a youth with the same dark hair, but rounder in the face.The youth seemed small for the fifteen years Kynes knew him to have.But the young body carried a sense of command, a poised assurance, as though he saw and knew things all around him that were not visible to others.And he wore the same style cloak as his father, yet with casual ease that made one think the boy had always worn such clothing.The Mahdi will be aware of things others cannot see, went the prophecy.Kynes shook his head, telling himself: Theyre just people.With the two, garbed like them for the desert, came a man Kynes recognized  Gurney Halleck.Kynes took a deep breath to still his resentment against Halleck, who had briefed him on how to behave with the Duke and ducal heir.You may call the Duke my Lord or Sire.Noble Born also is correct, but usually reserved for more formal occasions.The son may be addressed as young Master or my Lord.The Duke is a man of much leniency, but brooks little familiarity.And Kynes thought as he watched the group approach: Theyll learn soon enough whos master on Arrakis.Order me questioned half the night by that Mentat, will they?Expect me to guide them on an inspection of spice mining, do they?The import of Hawats questions had not escaped Kynes.They wanted the Imperial bases.And it was obvious theyd learned of the bases from Idaho.I will have Stilgar send Idahos head to this Duke, Kynes told himself.The ducal party was only a few paces away now, their feet in desert boots crunching the sand.Kynes bowed.My Lord, Duke.As he had approached the solitary figure standing near the ornithopter, Leto had studied him: tall, thin, dressed for the desert in loose robe, stillsuit, and low boots.The mans hood was thrown back, its veil hanging to one side, revealing long sandy hair, a sparse beard.The eyes were that fathomless blue within blue under thick brows.Remains of dark stains smudged his eye sockets.Youre the ecologist, the Duke said.We prefer the old title here, my Lord, Kynes said.Planetologist.As you wish, the Duke said.He glanced down at Paul.Son, this is the Judge of the Change, the arbiter of dispute, the man set here to see that the forms are obeyed in our assumption of power over this fief.He glanced at Kynes.And this is my son.My Lord, Kynes said.Are you a Fremen?Paul asked.Kynes smiled.I am accepted in both sietch and village, young Master.But I am in His Majestys service, the Imperial Planetologist.Paul nodded, impressed by the mans air of strength.Halleck had pointed Kynes out to Paul from an upper window of the administration building: The man standing there with the Fremen escort  the one moving now toward the ornithopter.Paul had inspected Kynes briefly with binoculars, noting the prim, straight mouth, the high forehead.Halleck had spoken in Pauls ear: Odd sort of fellow.Has a precise way of speaking  clipped off, no fuzzy edges  razor apt.And the Duke, behind them, had said: Scientist type.Now, only a few feet from the man, Paul sensed the power in Kynes, the impact of personality, as though he were blood royal, born to command.I understand we have you to thank for our stillsuits and these cloaks, the Duke said.I hope they fit well, my Lord, Kynes said.Theyre of Fremen make and as near as possible the dimensions given me by your man Halleck here.I was concerned that you said you couldnt take us into the desert unless we wore these garments, the Duke said.We can carry plenty of water.We dont intend to be out long and well have air cover  the escort you see overhead right now.It isnt likely wed be forced down.Kynes stared at him, seeing the water fat flesh.He spoke coldly: You never talk of likelihoods on Arrakis.You speak only of possibilities.Halleck stiffened.The Duke is to be addressed as my Lord or Sire!Leto gave Halleck their private handsignal to desist, said: Our ways are new here, Gurney.We must make allowances.As you wish, Sire.We are indebted to you, Dr Kynes, Leto said.These suits and the consideration for our welfare will be remembered.On impulse, Paul called to mind a quotation from the O. C.  Bible, said  The gift is the blessing of the giver.The words rang out overloud in the still air.The Fremen escort Kynes had left in the shade of the administration building leaped up from their squatting repose, muttering in open agitation.One cried out: Lisan al Gaib!Kynes whirled, gave a curt, chopping signal with a hand, waved the guard away.They fell back, grumbling among themselves, trailed away around the building.Most interesting, Leto said.Kynes passed a hard glare over the Duke and Paul, said: Most of the desert natives here are a superstitious lot.Pay no attention to them.They mean no harm.But he thought of the words of the legend: They will greet you with Holy Words and your gifts will be a blessing.Letos assessment of Kynes  based partly on Hawats brief verbal report (guarded and full of suspicions)  suddenly crystallized: the man was Fremen.Kynes had come with a Fremen escort, which could mean simply that the Fremen were testing their new freedom to enter urban areas  but it had seemed an honor guard.And by his manner, Kynes was a proud man, accustomed to freedom, his tongue and his manner guarded only by his own suspicions.Pauls first question had been direct and pertinent.Kynes had gone native.Shouldnt we be going, Sire?Halleck asked.The Duke nodded.Ill fly my own thopter.Kynes can sit up front with me to direct me.You and Paul take the rear seats.One moment, please, Kynes said.With your permission, Sire, I must check the security of your suits.The Duke started to speak, but Kynes pressed on: I have concern for my own flesh as well as yours  my Lord.Im well aware of whose throat would be slit should harm befall you two while youre in my care.The Duke frowned, thinking: How delicate this moment!If I refuse, it may offend him.And this could be a man whose value to me is beyond measure.Yet to let him inside my shield, touching my person when I know so little about him?The thoughts flicked through his mind with decision hard on their heels.Were in your hands, the Duke said.He stepped forward, opening his robe, saw Halleck come up on the balls of his feet, poised and alert, but remaining where he was.And, if youd be so kind, the Duke said, Id appreciate an explanation of the suit from one who lives so intimately with it.Certainly, Kynes said.He felt up under the robe for the shoulder seals, speaking as he examined the suit.Its basically a micro sandwich  a high efficiency filter and heat exchange system.He adjusted the shoulder seals.The skin contact layers porous.Perspiration passes through it, having cooled the body  near normal evaporation process.The next two layers  Kynes tightened the chest fit.include heat exchange filaments and salt precipitators.Salts reclaimed.The Duke lifted his arms at a gesture, said: Most interesting.Breathe deeply, Kynes said.The Duke obeyed.Keynes studied the underarm seals, adjusted one.Motions of the body, especially breathing, he said, and some osmotic action provide the pumping force.He loosened the chest fit slightly.Reclaimed water circulates to catchpockets from which you draw it through this tube in the clip at your neck.The Duke twisted his chin in and down to look at the end of the tube.Efficient and convenient, he said.Good engineering.Kynes knelt, examined the leg seals.Urine and feces are processed in the thigh pads, he said, and stood up, felt the neck fitting, lifted a sectioned flap there.In the open desert, you wear this filter across your face, this tube in the nostrils with these plugs to insure a tight fit.Breathe in through the mouth filter, out through the nose tube.With a Fremen suit in good working order, you wont lose more than a thimbleful of moisture a day  even if youre caught in the Great Erg.A thimbleful a day, the Duke said.Kynes pressed a finger against the suits forehead pad, said: This may rub a little.If it irritates you, please tell me.I could slip patch it a bit tighter.My thanks, the Duke said.He moved his shoulders in the suit as Kynes stepped back, realizing that it did feel better now  tighter and less irritating.Kynes turned to Paul.Now, lets have a look at you, lad.A good man but hell have to learn to address us properly, the Duke thought.Paul stood passively as Kynes inspected the suit.It had been an odd sensation putting on the crinkling, slick surfaced garment.In his force consciousness had been the absolute knowledge that he had never before worn a stillsuit.Yet, each motion of adjusting the adhesion tabs under Gurneys inexpert guidance had seemed natural, instinctive.When he had tightened the chest to gain maximum pumping action from the motion of breathing, he had known what he did and why.When he had fitted the neck and forehead tabs tightly, he had known it was to prevent friction blisters.Kynes straightened, stepped back with a puzzled expression.Youve worn a stillsuit before?he asked.This is the first time.Then someone adjusted it for you?No.Your desert boots are fitted slip fashion at the ankles.Who told you to do that?It  seemed the right way.That it most certainly is.And Kynes rubbed his cheek, thinking of the legend: He shall know your ways as though born to them.We waste time, the Duke said.He gestured to the waiting thopter, led the way, accepting the guards salute with a nod.He climbed in, fastened his safety harness, checked controls and instruments.The craft creaked as the others clambered aboard.Kynes fastened his harness, focused on the padded comfort of the aircraft  soft luxury of gray green upholstery, gleaming instruments, the sensation of filtered and washed air in his lungs as doors slammed and vent fans whirred alive.So soft!he thought.All secure, Sire, Halleck said.Leto fed power to the wings, felt them cup and dip  once, twice.They were airborne in ten meters, wings feathered tightly and afterjets thrusting them upward in a steep, hissing climb.Southeast over the Shield Wall, Kynes said.Thats where I told your sandmaster to concentrate his equipment.Right.The Duke banked into his air cover, the other craft taking up their guard positions as they headed southeast.The design and manufacture of these stillsuits bespeaks a high degree of sophistication, the Duke said.Someday I may show you a sietch factory, Kynes said.I would find that interesting, the Duke said.I note that suits are manufactured also in some of the garrison cities.Inferior copies, Kynes said.Any Dune man who values his skin wears a Fremen suit.And itll hold your water loss to a thimbleful a day?Properly suited, your forehead cap tight, all seals in order, your major water loss is through the palms of your hands, Kynes said.You can wear suit gloves if youre not using your hands for critical work, but most Fremen in the open desert rub their hands with juice from the leaves of the creosote bush.It inhibits perspiration.The Duke glanced down to the left at the broken landscape of the Shield Wall  chasms of tortured rock, patches of yellow brown crossed by black lines of fault shattering.It was as though someone had dropped this ground from space and left it where it smashed.They crossed a shallow basin with the clear outline of gray sand spreading across it from a canyon opening to the south.The sand fingers ran out into the basin  a dry delta outlined against darker rock.Kynes sat back, thinking about the water fat flesh he had felt beneath the stillsuits.They wore shield belts over their robes, slow pellet stunners at the waist, coin sized emergency transmitters on cords around their necks.Both the Duke and his son carried knives in wrist sheaths and the sheaths appeared well worn.These people struck Kynes as a strange combination of softness and armed strength.There was a poise to them totally unlike the Harkonnens.When you report to the Emperor on the change of government here, will you say we observed the rules?Leto asked.He glanced at Kynes, back to their course.The Harkonnens left; you came, Kynes said.And is everything as it should be?Leto asked.Momentary tension showed in the tightening of a muscle along Kynes jaw.As Planetologist and Judge of the Change, I am a direct subject of the Imperium  my Lord.The Duke smiled grimly.But we both know the realities.I remind you that His Majesty supports my work.Indeed?And what is your work?In the brief silence, Paul thought: Hes pushing this Kynes too hard.Paul glanced at Halleck, but the minstrel warrior was staring out at the barren landscape.Kynes spoke stiffly: You, of course, refer to my duties as planetologist.Of course.It is mostly dry land biology and botany  some geological work  core drilling and testing.You never really exhaust the possibilities of an entire planet.Do you also investigate the spice?Kynes turned, and Paul noted the hard line of the mans cheek.A curious question, my Lord.Bear in mind, Kynes, that this is now my fief.My methods differ from those of the Harkonnens.I dont care if you study the spice as long as I share what you discover.He glanced at the planetologist.The Harkonnens discouraged investigation of the spice, didnt they?Kynes stared back without answering.You may speak plainly, the Duke said, without fear for your skin.The Imperial Court is, indeed, a long way off, Kynes muttered.And he thought: What does this water soft invader expect?Does he think me fool enough to enlist with him?The Duke chuckled, keeping his attention on their course.I detect a sour note in your voice, sir.Weve waded in here with our mob of tame killers, eh?And we expect you to realize immediately that were different from the Harkonnens?Ive read the propaganda youve flooded into sietch and village, Kynes said.Love the good Duke!Your corps of  Here now!Halleck barked.He snapped his attention away from the window, leaned forward.Paul put a hand on Hallecks arm.Gurney!the Duke said.He glanced back.This mans been long under the Harkonnens.Halleck sat back.Ayah.Your man Hawats subtle, Kynes said, but his objects plain enough.Will you open those bases to us, then?the Duke asked.Kynes spoke curtly: Theyre His Majestys property.Theyre not being used.They could be used.Does His Majesty concur?Kynes darted a hard stare at the Duke.Arrakis could be an Eden if its rulers would look up from grubbing for spice!He didnt answer my question, the Duke thought.And he said: How is a planet to become an Eden without money?What is money, Kynes asked, if it wont buy the services you need?Ah now!the Duke thought.And he said: Well discuss this another time.Right now, I believe were coming to the edge of the Shield Wall.Do I hold the same course?The same course, Kynes muttered.Paul looked out his window.Beneath them, the broken ground began to drop away in tumbled creases toward a barren rock plain and a knife edged shelf.Beyond the shelf, fingernail crescents of dunes marched toward the horizon with here and there in the distance a dull smudge, a darker blotch to tell of something not sand.Rock outcroppings, perhaps.In the heat addled air, Paul couldnt be sure.Are there any plants down there?Paul asked.Some, Kynes said.This latitudes life zone has mostly what we call minor water stealers  adapted to raiding each other for moisture, gobbling up the trace dew.Some parts of the desert teem with life.But all of it has learned how to survive under these rigors.If you get caught down there, you imitate that life or you die.You mean steal water from each other?Paul asked.The idea outraged him, and his voice betrayed his emotion.Its done, Kynes said, but that wasnt precisely my meaning.You see, my climate demands a special attitude toward water.You are aware of water at all times.You waste nothing that contains moisture.And the Duke thought:  my climate!Come around two degrees more southerly, my Lord, Kynes said.Theres a blow coming up from the west.The Duke nodded.He had seen the billowing of tan dust there.He banked the thopter around, noting the way the escorts wings reflected milky orange from the dust refracted light as they turned to keep pace with him.This should clear the storms edge, Kynes said.That sand must be dangerous if you fly into it, Paul said.Will it really cut the strongest metals?At this altitude, its not sand but dust, Kynes said.The danger is lack of visibility, turbulence, clogged intakes.Well see actual spice mining today?Paul asked.Very likely, Kynes said.Paul sat back.He had used the questions and hyperawareness to do what his mother called registering the person.He had Kynes now  tune of voice, each detail of face and gesture.An unnatural folding of the left sleeve on the mans robe told of a knife in an arm sheath.The waist bulged strangely.It was said that desert men wore a belted sash into which they tucked small necessities.Perhaps the bulges came from such a sash  certainly not from a concealed shield belt.A copper pin engraved with the likeness of a hare clasped the neck of Kynes robe.Another smaller pin with similar likeness hung at the corner of the hood which was thrown back over his shoulders.Halleck twisted in the seat beside Paul, reached back into the rear compartment and brought out his baliset.Kynes looked around as Halleck tuned the instrument then returned his attention to their course.What would you like to hear, young Master?Halleck asked.You choose, Gurney, Paul said.Halleck bent his ear close to the sounding board, strummed a chord and sang softly:   Our fathers ate manna in the desert,  In the burning places where whirlwinds came.Lord, save us from that horrible land!Save us  oh h h h, save us  From the dry and thirsty land.Kynes glanced at the Duke, said: You do travel with a light complement of guards, my Lord.Are all of them such men of many talents?Gurney?The Duke chuckled.Gurneys one of a kind.I like him with me for his eyes.His eyes miss very little.The planetologist frowned.Without missing a beat in his tune, Halleck interposed:   For I am like an owl of the desert, o!Aiyah!am like an owl of tme des ert!The Duke reached down, brought up a microphone from the instrument panel, thumbed it to life, said: Leader to Escort Gemma.Flying object at nine oclock, Sector B.  Do you identify it?Its merely a bird, Kynes said, and added: You have sharp eyes.The panel speaker crackled, then: Escort Gemma.Object examined under full amplification.Its a large bird.Paul looked in the indicated direction, saw the distant speck: a dot of intermittent motion, and realized how keyed up his father must be.Every sense was at full alert.Id not realized there were birds that large this far into the desert, the Duke said.Thats likely an eagle, Kynes said.Many creatures have adapted to this place.The ornithopter swept over a bare rock plain.Paul looked down from their two thousand meters altitude, saw the wrinkled shadow of their craft and escort.The land beneath seemed flat, but shadow wrinkles said otherwise.Has anyone ever walked out of the desert?the Duke asked.Hallecks music stopped.He leaned forward to catch the answer.Not from the deep desert, Kynes said.Men have walked out of the second zone several times.Theyve survived by crossing the rock areas where worms seldom go.The timbre of Kynes voice held Pauls attention.He felt his senses come alert the way they were trained to do.Ah h, the worms, the Duke said.I must see one sometime.You may see one today, Kynes said.Wherever there is spice, there are worms.Always?Halleck asked.Always.Is there relationship between worm and spice?the Duke asked.Kynes turned and Paul saw the pursed lips as the man spoke.They defend spice sands.Each worm has a  territory.As to the spice  who knows?Worm specimens weve examined lead us to suspect complicated chemical interchanges within them.We find traces of hydrochloric acid in the ducts, more complicated acid forms elsewhere.Ill give you my monograph on the subject.And a shields no defense?the Duke asked.Shields!Kynes sneered.Activate a shield within the worm zone and you seal your fate.Worms ignore territory lines, come from far around to attack a shield.No man wearing a shield has ever survived such attack.How are worms taken, then?High voltage electrical shock applied separately to each ring segment is the only known way of killing and preserving an entire worm, Kynes said.They can be stunned and shattered by explosives, but each ring segment has a life of its own.Barring atomics, I know of no explosive powerful enough to destroy a large worm entirely.Theyre incredibly tough.Why hasnt an effort been made to wipe them out?Paul asked.Too expensive, Kynes said.Too much area to cover.Paul leaned back in his corner.His truthsense, awareness of tone shadings, told him that Kynes was lying and telling half truths.And he thought: If theres a relationship between spice and worms, killing the worms would destroy the spice.No one will have to walk out of the desert soon, the Duke said.Trip these little transmitters at our necks and rescue is on its way.All our workers will be wearing them before long.Were setting up a special rescue service.Very commendable, Kynes said.Your tone says you dont agree, the Duke said.Agree?Of course I agree, but it wont be much use.Static electricity from sandstorms masks out many signals.Transmitters short out.Theyve been tried here before, you know.Arrakis is tough on equipment.And if a worms hunting you theres not much time.Frequently, you have no more than fifteen or twenty minutes.What would you advise?the Duke asked.You ask my advice?As planetologist, yes.Youd follow my advice?If I found it sensible.Very well, my Lord.Never travel alone.The Duke turned his attention from the controls.Thats all?Thats all.Never travel alone.What if youre separated by a storm and forced down?Halleck asked.Isnt there anything you could do?Anything covers much territory, Kynes said.What would you do?Paul asked.Kynes turned a hard stare at the boy, brought his attention back to the Duke.Id remember to protect the integrity of my stillsuit.If I were outside the worm zone or in rock, Id stay with the ship.If I were down in open sand, Id get away from the ship as fast as I could.About a thousand meters would be far enough.Then Id hide beneath my robe.A worm would get the ship, but it might miss me.Then what?Halleck asked.Kynes shrugged.Wait for the worm to leave.Thats all?Paul asked.When the worm has gone, one may try to walk out, Kynes said.You must walk softly, avoid drum sands, tidal dust basins  head for the nearest rock zone.There are many such zones.You might make it.Drum sand?Halleck asked.A condition of sand compaction, Kynes said.The slightest step sets it drumming.Worms always come to that.And a tidal dust basin?the Duke asked.Certain depressions in the desert have filled with dust over the centuries.Some are so vast they have currents and tides.All will swallow the unwary who step into them.Halleck sat back, resumed strumming the baliset.Presently, he sang:   Wild beasts of the desert do hunt there,  Waiting for the innocents to pass.Oh h h, tempt not the gods of the desert,  Lest you seek a lonely epitaph.The perils of the    He broke off, leaned forward.Dust cloud ahead, Sire.I see it, Gurney.Thats what we seek.Kynes said.Paul stretched up in the seat to peer ahead, saw a rolling yellow cloud low on the desert surface some thirty kilometers ahead.One of your factory crawlers, Kynes said.Its on the surface and that means its on spice.The cloud is vented sand being expelled after the spice has been centrifugally removed.Theres no other cloud quite like it.Aircraft over it, the Duke said.I see two  three  four spotters, Kynes said.Theyre watching for wormsign.Wormsign?the Duke asked.A sandwave moving toward the crawler.Theyll have seismic probes on the surface, too.Worms sometimes travel too deep for the wave to show.Kynes swung his gaze around the sky.Should be a carryall wing around, but I dont see it.The worm always comes, eh?Halleck asked.Always.Paul leaned forward, touched Kynes shoulder.How big an area does each worm stake out?Kynes frowned.The child kept asking adult questions.That depends on the size of the worm.Whats the variation?the Duke asked.Big ones may control three or four hundred square kilometers.Small ones He broke off as the Duke kicked on the jet brakes.The ship bucked as its tail pods whispered to silence.Stub wings elongated, cupped the air.The craft became a full thopter as the Duke banked it, holding the wings to a gentle beat, pointing with his left hand off to the east beyond the factory crawler.Is that wormsign?Kynes leaned across the Duke to peer into the distance.Paul and Halleck were crowded together, looking in the same direction, and Paul noted that their escort, caught by the sudden maneuver, had surged ahead, but now was curving back.The factory crawler lay ahead of them, still some three kilometers away.Where the Duke pointed, crescent dune tracks spread shadow ripples toward the horizon and, running through them as a level line stretching into the distance, came an elongated mount in motion  a cresting of sand.It reminded Paul of the way a big fish disturbed the water when swimming just under the surface.Worm, Kynes said.Big one.He leaned back, grabbed the microphone from the panel, punched out a new frequency selection.Glancing at the grid chart on rollers over their heads, he spoke into the microphone: Calling crawler at Delta Ajaxniner.Wormsign warning.Crawler at Delta Ajax niner.Wormsign warning.Acknowledge, please.He waited.The panel speaker emitted static crackles, then a voice: Who calls Delta Ajax niner?Over.They seem pretty calm about it, Halleck said.Kynes spoke into the microphone: Unlisted flight  north and east of you about three kilometers.Wormsign is on intercept course, your position, estimated contact twenty five minutes.Another voice rumbled from the speaker: This is Spotter Control.Sighting confirmed.Stand by for contact fix.There was a pause, then: Contact in twenty six minutes minus.That was a sharp estimate.Whos on that unlisted flight?Over.Halleck had his harness off and surged forward between Kynes and the Duke.Is this the regular working frequency, Kynes?Yes.Why?Whod be listening?Just the work crews in this area.Cuts down interference.Again, the speaker crackled, then: This is Delta Ajax niner.Who gets bonus credit for that spot?Over.Halleck glanced at the Duke.Kynes said: Theres a bonus based on spice load for whoever gives first worm warning.They want to know  Tell them who had first sight of that worm, Halleck said.The Duke nodded.Kynes hesitated, then lifted the microphone: Spotter credit to the Duke Leto Atreides.The Duke Leto Atreides.Over.The voice from the speaker was flat and partly distorted by a burst of static: We read and thank you.Now, tell them to divide the bonus among themselves, Halleck ordered.Tell them its the Dukes wish.Kynes took a deep breath, then: Its the Dukes wish that you divide the bonus among your crew.Do you read?Over.Acknowledged and thank you, the speaker said.The Duke said: I forgot to mention that Gurney is also very talented in public relations.Kynes turned a puzzled frown on Halleck.This lets the men know their Duke is concerned for their safety, Halleck said.Word will get around.It was on an area working frequency  not likely Harkonnen agents heard.He glanced out at their air cover.And were a pretty strong force.It was a good risk.The Duke banked their craft toward the sandcloud erupting from the factory crawler.What happens now?Theres a carryall wing somewhere close, Kynes said.Itll come in and lift off the crawler.What if the carryalls wrecked?Halleck asked.Some equipment is lost, Kynes said.Get in close over the crawler, my Lord; youll find this interesting.The Duke scowled, busied himself with the controls as they came into turbulent air over the crawler.Paul looked down, saw sand still spewing out of the metal and plastic monster beneath them.It looked like a great tan and blue beetle with many wide tracks extending on arms around it.He saw a giant inverted funnel snout poked into dark sand in front of it.Rich spice bed by the color, Kynes said.Theyll continue working until the last minute.The Duke fed more power to the wings, stiffened them for a steeper descent as he settled lower in a circling glide above the crawler.A glance left and right showed his cover holding altitude and circling overhead.Paul studied the yellow cloud belching from the crawlers pipe vents, looked out over the desert at the approaching worm track.Shouldnt we be hearing them call in the carryall?Halleck asked.They usually have the wing on a different frequency, Kynes said.Shouldnt they have two carryalls standing by for every crawler?the Duke asked.There should be twenty six men on that machine down there, not to mention cost of equipment.Kynes said: You dont have enough ex  He broke off as the speaker erupted with an angry voice: Any of you see the wing?He isnt answering.A garble of noise crackled from the speaker, drowned in an abrupt override signal, then silence and the first voice: Report by the numbers!Over.This is Spotter Control.Last I saw, the wing was pretty high and circling off northwest.I dont see him now.Over.Spotter one: negative.Over.Spotter two: negative.Over.Spotter three: negative.Over.Silence.The Duke looked down.His own crafts shadow was just passing over the crawler.Only four spotters, is that right?Correct, Kynes said.There are five in our party, the Duke said.Our ships are larger.We can crowd in three extra each.Their spotters ought to be able to lift off two each.Paul did the mental arithmetic, said: Thats three short.Why dont they have two carryalls to each crawler?barked the Duke.You dont have enough extra equipment, Kynes said.All the more reason we should protect what we have!Where could that carryall go?Halleck asked.Couldve been forced down somewhere out of sight, Kynes said.The Duke grabbed the microphone, hesitated with thumb poised over its switch.How could they lose sight of a carryall?They keep their attention on the ground looking for wormsign, Kynes said.The Duke thumbed the switch, spoke into the microphone.This is your Duke.We are coming down to take off Delta Ajax niners crew.All spotters are ordered to comply.Spotters will land on the east side.We will take the west.Over.He reached down, punched out his own command frequency, repeated the order for his own air cover, handed the microphone back to Kynes.Kynes returned to the working frequency and a voice blasted from the speaker:  almost a full load of spice!We have almost a full load!We cant leave that for a damned worm!Over.Damn the spice!the Duke barked.He grabbed back the microphone, said: We can always get more spice.There are seats in our ships for all but three of you.Draw straws or decide any way you like whos to go.But youre going, and thats an order!He slammed the microphone back into Kynes hands, muttered: Sorry, as Kynes shook an injured finger.How much time?Paul asked.Nine minutes, Kynes said.The Duke said: The ship has more power than the others.If we took off under jet with three quarter wings, we could crowd in an additional man.That sands soft, Kynes said.With four extra men aboard on a jet takeoff, we could snap the wings, Sire, Halleck said.Not on this ship, the Duke said.He hauled back on the controls as the thopter glided in beside the crawler.The wings tipped up, braked the thopter to a skidding stop within twenty meters of the factory.The crawler was silent now, no sand spouting from its vents.Only a faint mechanical rumble issued from it, becoming more audible as the Duke opened his door.Immediately, their nostrils were assailed by the odor of cinnamon  heavy and pungent.With a loud flapping, the spotter aircraft glided down to the sand on the other side of the crawler.The Dukes own escort swooped in to land in line with him.Paul, looking out at the factory, saw how all the thopters were dwarfed by it  gnats beside a warrior beetle.Gurney, you and Paul toss out that rear seat, the Duke said.He manually cranked the wings out to three quarters, set their angle, checked the jet pod controls.Why the devil arent they coming out of that machine?Theyre hoping the carryall will show up, Kynes said.They still have a few minutes.He glanced off to the east.All turned to look in the same direction, seeing no sign of the worm, but there was a heavy, charged feeling of anxiety in the air.The Duke took the microphone, punched for his command frequency, said: Two of you toss out your shield generators.By the numbers.You can carry one more man that way.Were not leaving any men for that monster.He keyed back to the working frequency, barked: All right, you in Delta Ajax niner!Out!Now!This is a command from your Duke!On the double or Ill cut that crawler apart with a lasgun!A hatch snapped open near the front of the factory, another at the rear, another at the top.Men came tumbling out, sliding and scrambling down to the sand.A tall man in a patched working robe was the last to emerge.He jumped down to a track and then to the sand.The Duke hung the microphone on the panel, swung out onto the wing step, shouted: Two men each into your spotters.The man in the patched robe began tolling off pairs of his crew, pushing them toward the craft waiting on the other side.Four over here!the Duke shouted.Four into that ship back there!He jabbed a finger at an escort thopter directly behind him.The guards were just wrestling the shield generator out of it.And four into that ship over there!He pointed to the other escort that had shed its shield generator.Three each into the others!Run, you sand dogs!The tall man finished counting off his crew, came slogging across the sand followed by three of his companions.I hear the worm, but I cant see it, Kynes said.The others heard it then  an abrasive slithering, distant and growing louder.Damn sloppy way to operate, the Duke muttered.Aircraft began flapping off the sand around them.It reminded the Duke of a time in his home planets jungles, a sudden emergence into a clearing, and carrion birds lifting away from the carcass of a wild ox.The spice workers slogged up to the side of the thopter, started climbing in behind the Duke.Halleck helped, dragging them into the rear.In you go, boys!he snapped.On the double!Paul, crowded into a corner by sweating men, smelled the perspiration of fear, saw that two of the men had poor neck adjustments on their stillsuits.He filed the information in his memory for future action.His father would have to order tighter  stillsuit discipline.Men tended to become sloppy if you didnt watch such things.The last man came gasping into the rear, said: The worm!Its almost on us!Blast off!The Duke slid into his seat, frowning, said: We still have almost three minutes on the original contact estimate.Is that right, Kynes?He shut his door, checked it.Almost exactly, my Lord, Kynes said, and he thought: A cool one, this duke.All secure here, Sire, Halleck said.The Duke nodded, watched the last of his escort take off.He adjusted the igniter, glanced once more at wings and instruments, punched the jet sequence.The take off pressed the Duke and Kynes deep into their seats, compressed the people in the rear.Kynes watched the way the Duke handled the controls  gently, surely.The thopter was fully airborne now, and the Duke studied his instruments, glanced left and right at his wings.Shes very heavy, Sire, Halleck said.Well within the tolerances of this ship, the Duke said.You didnt really think Id risk this cargo, did you Gurney?Halleck grinned, said: Not a bit of it, Sire.The Duke banked his craft in a long easy curve  climbing over the crawler.Paul, crushed into a corner beside a window, stared down at the silent machine on the sand.The wormsign had broken off about four hundred meters from the crawler.And now, there appeared to be turbulence in the sand around the factory.The worm is now beneath the crawler, Kynes said.You are about to witness a thing few have seen.Flecks of dust shadowed the sand around the crawler now.The big machine began to tip down to the right.A gigantic sand whirlpool began forming there to the right of the crawler.It moved faster and faster.Sand and dust filled the air now for hundreds of meters around.Then they saw it!A wide hole emerged from the sand.Sunlight flashed from glistening white spokes within it.The holes diameter was at least twice the length of the crawler, Paul estimated.He watched as the machine slid into that opening in a billow of dust and sand.The hole pulled back.Gods, what a monster!muttered a man beside Paul.Got all our floggin spice!growled another.Someone is going to pay for this, the Duke said.I promise you that.By the very flatness of his fathers voice, Paul sensed the deep anger.He found that he shared it.This was criminal waste!In the silence that followed, they heard Kynes.Bless the Maker and His water, Kynes murmured.Bless the coming and going of Him.May His passage cleanse the world.May He keep the world for His people.Whats that youre saying?the Duke asked.But Kynes remained silent.Paul glanced at the men crowded around him.They were staring fearfully at the back of Kynes head.One of them whispered: Liet.Kynes turned, scowling.The man sank back, abashed.Another of the rescued men began coughing  dry and rasping.Presently, he gasped: Curse this hell hole!The tall Dune man who had come last out of the crawler said: Be you still, Coss.You but worsen your cough.He stirred among the men until he could look through them at the back of the Dukes head.You be the Duke Leto, I warrant, he said.Its to you we give thanks for our lives.We were ready to end it there until you came along.Quiet, man, and let the Duke fly his ship, Halleck muttered.Paul glanced at Halleck.He, too, had seen the tension wrinkles at the corner of his fathers jaw.One walked softly when the Duke was in a rage.Leto began easing his thopter out of its great banking circle, stopped at a new sign of movement on the sand.The worm had withdrawn into the depths and now, near where the crawler had been, two figures could be seen moving north away from the sand depression.They appeared to glide over the surface with hardly a lifting of dust to mark their passage.Whos that down there?the Duke barked.Two Johnnies who came along for the ride, Soor, said the tall Dune man.Why wasnt something said about them?It was the chance they took, Soor, the Dune man said.My Lord, said Kynes, these men know its of little use to do anything about men trapped on the desert in worm country.Well send a ship from base for them!the Duke snapped.As you wish, my Lord, Kynes said.But likely when the ship gets here therell be no one to rescue.Well send a ship anyway, the Duke said.They were right beside where the worm came up, Paul said.Howd they escape?The sides of the hole cave in and make the distances deceptive, Kynes said.You waste fuel here, Sire, Halleck ventured.Aye, Gurney.The Duke brought his craft toward the Shield Wall.His escort came down from circling stations, took up positions above and on both sides.Paul thought about what the Dune man and Kynes had said.He sensed half truths, outright lies.The men on the sand had glided across the surface so surely, moving in a way obviously calculated to keep from luring the worm back out of its depths.Fremen!Paul thought.Who else would be so sure on the sand?Who else might be left out of your worries as a matter of course  because they are in no danger?They know how to live here!They know how to outwit the worm!What were Fremen doing on that crawler?Paul asked.Kynes whirled.The tall Dune man turned wide eyes on Paul  blue within blue within blue.Who be this lad?he asked.Halleck moved to place himself between the man and Paul, said: This is Paul Atreides, the ducal heir.Why says he there were Fremen on our rumbler?the man asked.They fit the description, Paul said.Kynes snorted.You cant tell Fremen just by looking at them!He looked at the Dune man.You.Who were those men?Friends of one of the others, the Dune man said.Just friends from a village who wanted to see the spice sands.Kynes turned away.Fremen!But he was remembering the words of the legend: The Lisan al Gaib shall see through all subterfuge.They be dead now, most likely, young Soor, the Dune man said.We should not speak unkindly on them.But Paul heard the falsehood in their voices, felt the menace that had brought Halleck instinctively into guarding position.Paul spoke dryly: A terrible place for them to die.Without turning, Kynes said: When God hath ordained a creature to die in a particular place, He causeth that creatures wants to direct him to that place.Leto turned a hard stare at Kynes.And Kynes, returning the stare, found himself troubled by a fact he had observed here: This Duke was concerned more over the men than he was over the spice.He risked his own life and that of his son to save the men.He passed off the loss of a spice crawler with a gesture.The threat to mens lives had him in a rage.A leader such as that would command fanatic loyalty.He would be difficult to defeat.Against his own will and all previous judgments, Kynes admitted to himself: I like this duke.Greatness is a transitory experience.It is never consistent.It depends in part upon the myth making imagination of humankind.The person who experiences greatness must have a feeling for the myth he is in.He must reflect what is projected upon him.And he must have a strong sense of the sardonic.This is what uncouples him from belief in his own pretensions.The sardonic is all that permits him to move within himself.Without this quality, even occasional greatness will destroy a man.from Collected Sayings of MuadDib by the Princess Irulan    In the dining hall of the Arrakeen great house, suspensor lamps had been lighted against the early dark.They cast their yellow glows upward onto the black bulls head with its bloody horns, and onto the darkly glistening oil painting of the Old Duke.Beneath these talismans, white linen shone around the burnished reflections of the Atreides silver, which had been placed in precise arrangements along the great table  little archipelagos of service waiting beside crystal glasses, each setting squared off before a heavy wooden chair.The classic central chandelier remained unlighted, and its chain twisted upward into shadows where the mechanism of the poison snooper had been concealed.Pausing in the doorway to inspect the arrangements, the Duke thought about the poison snooper and what it signified in his society.All of a pattern, he thought.You can plumb us by our language  the precise and delicate delineations for ways to administer treacherous death.Will someone try chaumurky tonight  poison in the drink?Or will it be chaumas  poison in the food?He shook his head.Beside each plate on the long table stood a flagon of water.There was enough water along the table, the Duke estimated, to keep a poor Arrakeen family for more than a year.Flanking the doorway in which he stood were broad laving basins of ornate yellow and green tile.Each basin had its rack of towels.It was the custom, the housekeeper had explained, for guests as they entered to dip their hands ceremoniously into a basin, slop several cups of water onto the floor, dry their hands on a towel and fling the towel into the growing puddle at the door.After the dinner, beggars gathered outside to get the water squeezings from the towels.How typical of a Harkonnen fief the Duke thought.Every degradation of the spirit that can be conceived.He took a deep breath, feeling rage tighten his stomach.The custom stops here!he muttered.He saw a serving woman  one of the old and gnarled ones the housekeeper had recommended  hovering at the doorway from the kitchen across from him.The Duke signaled with upraised hand.She moved out of the shadows, scurried around the table toward him, and he noted the leathery face, the blue within blue eyes.My Lord wishes?She kept her head bowed, eyes shielded.He gestured.Have these basins and towels removed.But  Noble Born  She looked up, mouth gaping.I know the custom!he barked.Take these basins to the front door.While were eating and until weve finished, each beggar who calls may have a full cup of water.Understood?Her leathery face displayed a twisting of emotions: dismay, anger   With sudden insight, Leto realized she must have planned to sell the water squeezings from the foot trampled towels, wringing a few coppers from the wretches who came to the door.Perhaps that also was a custom.His face clouded, and he growled: Im posting a guard to see that my orders are carried out to the letter.He whirled, strode back down the passage to the Great Hall.Memories rolled in his mind like the toothless mutterings of old women.He remembered open water and waves  days of grass instead of sand  dazed summers that had whipped past him like windstorm leaves.All gone.Im getting old, he thought.Ive felt the cold hand of my mortality.And in what?An old womans greed.In the Great Hall, the Lady Jessica was the center of a mixed group standing in front of the fireplace.An open blaze crackled there, casting flickers of orange light onto jewels and laces and costly fabrics.He recognized in the group a stillsuit manufacturer down from Carthag, an electronics equipment importer, a water shipper whose summer mansion was near his polar cap factory, a representative of the Guild Bank (lean and remote, that one), a dealer in replacement parts for spice mining equipment, a thin and hard faced woman whose escort service for off planet visitors reputedly operated as cover for various smuggling, spying, and blackmail operations.Most of the women in the hall seemed cast from a specific type  decorative, precisely turned out, an odd mingling of untouchable sensousness.Even without her position as hostess, Jessica would have dominated the group, he thought.She wore no jewelry and had chosen warm colors  a long dress almost the shade of the open blaze, and an earth brown band around her bronzed hair.He realized she had done this to taunt him subtly, a reproof against his recent pose of coldness.She was well aware that he liked her best in these shades  that he saw her as a rustling of warm colors.Nearby, more an outflanker than a member of the group, stood Duncan Idaho in glittering dress uniform, flat face unreadable, the curling black hair neatly combed.He had been summoned back from the Fremen and had his orders from Hawat  Under pretext of guarding her, you will keep the Lady Jessica under constant surveillance.The Duke glanced around the room.There was Paul in the corner surrounded by a fawning group of the younger Arrakeen richece, and, aloof among them, three officers of the House Troop.The Duke took particular note of the young women.What a catch a ducal heir would make.But Paul was treating all equally with an air of reserved nobility.Hell wear the title well, the Duke thought, and realized with a sudden chill that this was another death thought.Paul saw his father in the doorway, avoided his eyes.He looked around at the clusterings of guests, the jeweled hands clutching drinks (and the unobtrusive inspections with tiny remote cast snoopers).Seeing all the chattering faces, Paul was suddenly repelled by them.They were cheap masks locked on festering thoughts  voices gabbling to drown out the loud silence in every breast.Im in a sour mood, he thought, and wondered what Gurney would say to that.He knew his moods source.He hadnt wanted to attend this function, but his father had been firm.You have a place  a position to uphold.Youre old enough to do this.Youre almost a man.Paul saw his father emerge from the doorway, inspect the room, then cross to the group around the Lady Jessica.As Leto approached Jessicas group, the water shipper was asking: Is it true the Duke will put in weather control?From behind the man, the Duke said: We havent gone that far in our thinking, sir.The man turned, exposing a bland round face, darkly tanned.Ah h, the Duke, he said.We missed you.Leto glanced at Jessica.A thing needed doing.He returned his attention to the water shipper, explained what he had ordered for the laving basins, adding: As far as Im concerned, the old custom ends now.Is this a ducal order, mLord?the man asked.I leave that to your own  ah  conscience, the Duke said.He turned, noting Kynes come up to the group.One of the women said: I think its a very generous gesture  giving water to the Someone shushed her.The Duke looked at Kynes, noting that the planetologist wore an old style dark brown uniform with epaulets of the Imperial Civil Servant and a tiny gold teardrop of rank at his collar.The water shipper asked in an angry voice: Does the Duke imply criticism of our custom?This custom has been changed, Leto said.He nodded to Kynes, marked the frown on Jessicas face, thought: A frown does not become her, but itll increase rumors of friction between us.With the Dukes permission, the water shipper said, Id like to inquire further about customs.Leto heard the sudden oily tone in the mans voice, noted the watchful silence in this group, the way heads were beginning to turn toward them around the room.Isnt it almost time for dinner?Jessica asked.But our guest has some questions, Leto said.And he looked at the water shipper, seeing a round faced man with large eyes and thick lips, recalling Hawats memorandum:  and this water shipper is a man to watch  Lingar Bewt, remember the name.The Harkonnens used him but never fully controlled him.Water customs are so interesting, Bewt said, and there was a smile on his face.Im curious what you intend about the conservatory attached to this house.Do you intend to continue flaunting it in the peoples faces  mLord?Leto held anger in check, staring at the man.Thoughts raced through his mind.It had taken bravery to challenge him in his own ducal castle, especially since they now had Bewts signature over a contract of allegiance.The action had taken, also, a knowledge of personal power.Water was, indeed, power here.If water facilities were mined, for instance, ready to be destroyed at a signal  The man looked capable of such a thing.Destruction of water facilities might well destroy Arrakis.That could well have been the club this Bewt held over the Harkonnens.My Lord, the Duke, and I have other plans for our conservatory, Jessica said.She smiled at Leto.We intend to keep it, certainly, but only to hold it in trust for the people of Arrakis.It is our dream that someday the climate of Arrakis may be changed sufficiently to grow such plants anywhere in the open.Bless her!Leto thought.Let our water shipper chew on that.Your interest in water and weather control is obvious, the Duke said.Id advise you to diversify your holdings.One day, water will not be a precious commodity on Arrakis.And he thought: Hawat must redouble his efforts at infiltrating this Bewts organization.And we must start on stand by water facilities at once.No man is going to hold a club over my head!Bewt nodded, the smile still on his face.A commendable dream, my Lord.He withdrew a pace.Letos attention was caught by the expression on Kynes face.The man was staring at Jessica.He appeared transfigured  like a man in love  or caught in a religious trance.Kynes thoughts were overwhelmed at last by the words of prophecy: And they shall share your most precious dream.He spoke directly to Jessica: Do you bring the shortening of the way?Ah, Dr Kynes, the water shipper said.Youve come in from tramping around with your mobs of Fremen.How gracious of you.Kynes passed an unreadable glance across Bewt, said: It is said in the desert that possession of water in great amount can inflict a man with fatal carelessness.They have many strange sayings in the desert, Bewt said, but his voice betrayed uneasiness.Jessica crossed to Leto, slipped her hand under his arm to gain a moment in which to calm herself.Kynes had said:  the shortening of the way.In the old tongue, the phrase translated as Kwisatz Haderach.The planetologists odd question seemed to have gone unnoticed by the others, and now Kynes was bending over one of the consort women, listening to a low voiced coquetry.Kwisatz Haderach, Jessica thought.Did our Missionaria Protectiva plant that legend here, too?The thought fanned her secret hope for Paul.He could be the Kwisatz Haderach.He could be.The Guild Bank representative had fallen into conversation with the water shipper, and Bewts voice lifted above the renewed hum of conversations: Many people have sought to change Arrakis.The Duke saw how the words seemed to pierce Kynes, jerking the planetologist upright and away from the flirting woman.Into the sudden silence, a house trooper in uniform of a footman cleared his throat behind Leto, said: Dinner is served, my Lord.The Duke directed a questioning glance down at Jessica.The custom here is for host and hostess to follow their guests to table, she said, and smiled: Shall we change that one, too, my Lord?He spoke coldly: That seems a goodly custom.We shall let it stand for now.The illusion that I suspect her of treachery must be maintained, he thought.He glanced at the guests filing past them.Who among you believes this lie?Jessica, sensing his remoteness, wondered at it as she had done frequently the past week.He acts like a man struggling with himself, she thought.Is it because I moved so swiftly setting up this dinner party?Yet, he knows how important it is that we begin to mix our officers and men with the locals on a social plane.We are father and mother surrogate to them all.Nothing impresses that fact more firmly than this sort of social sharing.Leto, watching the guests file past, recalled what Thufir Hawat had said when informed of the affair: Sire!I forbid it!A grim smile touched the Dukes mouth.What a scene that had been.And when the Duke had remained adamant about attending the dinner, Hawat had shaken his head.I have bad feelings about this, my Lord, hed said.Things move too swiftly on Arrakis.Thats not like the Harkonnens.Not like them at all.Paul passed his father escorting a young woman half a head taller than himself.He shot a sour glance at his father, nodded at something the young woman said.Her father manufactures stillsuits,Jessica said.Im told that only a fool would be caught in the deep desert wearing one of the mans suits.Whos the man with the scarred face ahead of Paul?the Duke asked.I dont place him.A late addition to the list, she whispered.Gurney arranged the invitation.Smuggler.Gurney arranged?At my request.It was cleared with Hawat, although I thought Hawat was a little stiff about it.The smugglers called Tuek, Esmar Tuek.Hes a power among his kind.They all know him here.Hes dined at many of the houses.Why is he here?Everyone here will ask that question, she said.Tuek will sow doubt and suspicion just by his presence.Hell also serve notice that youre prepared to back up your orders against graft  by enforcement from the smugglers end as well.This was the point Hawat appeared to like.Im not sure I like it.He nodded to a passing couple, saw only a few of their guests remained to precede them.Why didnt you invite some Fremen?Theres Kynes, she said.Yes, theres Kynes, he said.Have you arranged any other little surprises for me?He led her into step behind the procession.All else is most conventional, she said.And she thought: My darling, cant you see that this smuggler controls fast ships, that he can be bribed?We must have a way out, a door of escape from Arrakis if all else fails us here.As they emerged into the dining hall, she disengaged her arm, allowed Leto to seat her.He strode to his end of the table.A footman held his chair for him.The others settled with a swishing of fabrics, a scraping of chairs, but the Duke remained standing.He gave a hand signal, and the house troopers in footman uniform around the table stepped back, standing at attention.Uneasy silence settled over the room.Jessica, looking down the length of the table, saw a faint trembling at the corners of Letos mouth, noted the dark flush of anger on his cheeks.What has angered him?she asked herself.Surely not my invitation to the smuggler.Some question my changing of the laving basin custom, Leto said.This is my way of telling you that many things will change.Embarrassed silence settled over the table.They think him drunk, Jessica thought.Leto lifted his water flagon, held it aloft where the suspensor lights shot beams of reflection off it.As a Chevalier of the Imperium, then, he said, I give you a toast.The others grasped their flagons, all eyes focused on the Duke.In the sudden stillness, a suspensor light drifted slightly in an errant breeze from the serving kitchen hallway.Shadows played across the Dukes hawk features.Here I am and here I remain!he barked.There was an abortive movement of flagons toward mouths  stopped as the Duke remained with arm upraised.My toast is one of those maxims so dear to our hearts: Business makes progress!Fortune passes everywhere!He sipped his water.The others joined him.Questioning glances passed among them.Gurney!the Duke called.From an alcove at Letos end of the room came Hallecks voice.Here, my Lord.Give us a tune, Gurney.A minor chord from the baliset floated out of the alcove.Servants began putting plates of food on the table at the Dukes gesture releasing them  roast desert hare in sauce cepeda, aplomage sirian, chukka under glass, coffee with melange (a rich cinnamon odor from the spice wafted across the table), a true pot a oie served with sparkling Caladan wine.Still, the Duke remained standing.As the guests waited, their attention torn between the dishes placed before them and the standing Duke, Leto said: In olden times, it was the duty of the host to entertain his guests with his own talents.His knuckles turned white, so fiercely did he grip his water flagon.I cannot sing, but I give you the words of Gurneys song.Consider it another toast  a toast to all whove died bringing us to this station.An uncomfortable stirring sounded around the table.Jessica lowered her gaze, glanced at the people seated nearest her  there was the round faced water shipper and his woman, the pale and austere Guild Bank representative (he seemed a whistle faced scarecrow with his eyes fixed on Leto), the rugged and scar faced Tuek, his blue within blue eyes downcast.Review, friends  troops long past review, the Duke intoned.All to fate a weight of pains and dollars.Their spirits wear our silver collars.Review, friends  troops long past review.Each a dot of time without pretense or guile.With them passes the lure of fortune.Review, friends  troops long past review.When our time ends on its rictus smile, well pass the lure of fortune.The Duke allowed his voice to trail off on the last line, took a deep drink from his water flagon, slammed it back onto the table.Water slopped over the brim onto the linen.The others drank in embarrassed silence.Again, the Duke lifted his water flagon, and this time emptied its remaining half onto the floor, knowing that the others around the table must do the same.Jessica was first to follow his example.There was a frozen moment before the others began emptying their flagons.Jessica saw how Paul, seated near his father, was studying the reactions around him.She found herself also fascinated by what her guests actions revealed  especially among the women.This was clean, potable water, not something already cast away in a sopping towel.Reluctance to just discard it exposed itself in trembling hands, delayed reactions, nervous laughter  and violent obedience to the necessity.One woman dropped her flagon, looked the other way as her male companion recovered it.Kynes, though, caught her attention most sharply.The planetologist hesitated, then emptied his flagon into a container beneath his jacket.He smiled at Jessica as he caught her watching him, raised the empty flagon to her in a silent toast.He appeared completely unembarrassed by his action.Hallecks music still wafted over the room, but it had come out of its minor key, lilting and lively now as though he were trying to lift the mood.Let the dinner commence, the Duke said, and sank into his chair.Hes angry and uncertain, Jessica thought.The loss of that factory crawler hit him more deeply than it should have.It must be something more than that loss.He acts like a desperate man.She lifted her fork, hoping in the motion to hide her own sudden bitterness.Why not?He is desperate.Slowly at first, then with increasing animation, the dinner got under way.The stillsuit manufacturer complimented Jessica on her chef and wine.We brought both from Caladan, she said.Superb!he said, tasting the chukka.Simply superb!And not a hint of melange in it.One gets so tired of the spice in everything.The Guild Bank representative looked across at Kynes.I understand, Doctor Kynes, that another factory crawler has been lost to a worm.News travels fast, the Duke said.Then its true?the banker asked, shifting his attention to Leto.Of course, its true!the Duke snapped.The blasted carryall disappeared.It shouldnt be possible for anything that big to disappear!When the worm came, there was nothing to recover the crawler, Kynes said.It should not be possible!the Duke repeated.No one saw the carryall leave?the banker asked.Spotters customarily keep their eyes on the sand, Kynes said.Theyre primarily interested in wormsign.A carryalls complement usually is four men  two pilots and two journeymen attachers.If one  or even two of this crew were in the pay of the Dukes foes  A h h, I see, the banker said.And you, as Judge of the Change, do you challenge this?I shall have to consider my position carefully, Kynes said, and I certainly will not discuss it at table.And he thought: That pale skeleton of a man!He knows this is the kind of infraction I was instructed to ignore.The banker smiled, returned his attention to his food.Jessica sat remembering a lecture from her Bene Gesserit schooldays.The subject had been espionage and counterespionage.A plump, happy faced Reverend Mother had been the lecturer, her jolly voice contrasting weirdly with the subject matter.A thing to note about any espionage and/or counter espionage school is the similar basic reaction pattern of all its graduates.Any enclosed discipline sets its stamp, its pattern, upon its students.That pattern is susceptible to analysis and prediction.Now, motivational patterns are going to be similar among all espionage agents.That is to say: there will be certain types of motivation that are similar despite differing schools or opposed aims.You will study first how to separate this element for your analysis  in the beginning, through interrogation patterns that betray the inner orientation of the interrogators; secondly, by close observation of language thought orientation of those under analysis.You will find it fairly simple to determine the root languages of your subjects, of course, both through voice inflection and speech pattern.Now, sitting at table with her son and her Duke and their guests, hearing the Guild Bank representative, Jessica felt a chill of realization: the man was a Harkonnen agent.He had the Giedi Prime speech pattern  subtly masked, but exposed to her trained awareness as though he had announced himself.Does this mean the Guild itself has taken sides against House Atreides?she asked herself.The thought shocked her, and she masked her emotion by calling for a new dish, all the while listening for the man to betray his purpose.He will shift the conversation next to something innocent, but with ominous overtones, she told herself.Its his pattern.The banker swallowed, took a sip of wine, smiled at something said to him by the woman on his right.He seemed to listen for a moment to a man down the table who was explaining to the Duke that native Arrakeen plants had no thorns.I enjoy watching the flights of birds on Arrakis, the banker said, directing his words at Jessica.All of our birds, of course, are carrion eaters, and many exist without water, having become blood drinkers.The stillsuit manufacturers daughter, seated between Paul and his father at the other end of the table, twisted her pretty face into a frown, said: Oh, Soo Soo, you say the most disgusting things.The banker smiled.They call me Soo Soo because Im financial adviser to the Water Peddlers Union.And, as Jessica continued to look at him without comment, he added: Because of the water sellers cry  Soo Soo Sook!And he imitated the call with such accuracy that many around the table laughed.Jessica heard the boastful tone of voice, but noted most that the young woman had spoken on cue  a set piece.She had produced the excuse for the banker to say what he had said.She glanced at Lingar Bewt.The water magnate was scowling, concentrating on his dinner.It came to Jessica that the banker had said: I, too, control that ultimate source of power on Arrakis  water.Paul had marked the falseness in his dinner companions voice, saw that his mother was following the conversation with Bene Gesserit intensity.On impulse, he decided to play the foil, draw the exchange out.He addressed himself to the banker.Do you mean, sir, that these birds are cannibals?Thats an odd question, young Master, the banker said.I merely said the birds drink blood.It doesnt have to be the blood of their own kind, does it?It was not an odd question, Paul said, and Jessica noted the brittle riposte quality of her training exposed in his voice.Most educated people know that the worst potential competition for any young organism can come from its own kind.He deliberately forked a bite of food from his companions plate, ate it.They are eating from the same bowl.They have the same basic requirements.The banker stiffened, scowled at the Duke.Do not make the error of considering my son a child, the Duke said.And he smiled.Jessica glanced around the table, noted that Bewt had brightened, that both Kynes and the smuggler, Tuek, were grinning.Its a rule of ecology, Kynes said, that the young Master appears to understand quite well.The struggle between life elements is the struggle for the free energy of a system.Bloods an efficient energy source.The banker put down his fork, spoke in an angry voice: Its said that the Fremen scum drink the blood of their dead.Kynes shook his head, spoke in a lecturing tone: Not the blood, sir.But all of a mans water, ultimately, belongs to his people  to his tribe.Its a necessity when you live near the Great Flat.All waters precious there, and the human body is composed of some seventy per cent water by weight.A dead man, surely, no longer requires that water.The banker put both hands against the table beside his plate, and Jessica thought he was going to push himself back, leave in a rage.Kynes looked at Jessica.Forgive me, my Lady, for elaborating on such an ugly subject at table, but you were being told falsehood and it needed clarifying.Youve associated so long with Fremen that youve lost all sensibilities, the banker rasped.Kynes looked at him calmly, studied the pale, trembling face.Are you challenging me, sir?The banker froze.He swallowed, spoke stiffly: Of course not.Id not so insult our host and hostess.Jessica heard the fear in the mans voice, saw it in his face, in his breathing, in the pulse of a vein at his temple.The man was terrified of Kynes!Our host and hostess are quite capable of deciding for themselves when theyve been insulted, Kynes said.Theyre brave people who understand defense of honor.We all may attest to their courage by the fact that they are here  now  on Arrakis.Jessica saw that Leto was enjoying this.Most of the others were not.People all around the table sat poised for flight, hands out of sight under the table.Two notable exceptions were Bewt, who was openly smiling at the bankers discomfiture, and the smuggler, Tuek, who appeared to be watching Kynes for a cue.Jessica saw that Paul was looking at Kynes in admiration.Well?Kynes said.I meant no offense, the banker muttered.If offense was taken, please accept my apologies.Freely given, freely accepted, Kynes said.He smiled at Jessica, resumed eating as though nothing had happened.Jessica saw that the smuggler, too, had relaxed.She marked this: the man had shown every aspect of an aide ready to leap to Kynes assistance.There existed an accord of some sort between Kynes and Tuek.Leto toyed with a fork, looked speculatively at Kynes.The ecologists manner indicated a change in attitude toward the House of Atreides.Kynes had seemed colder on their trip over the desert.Jessica signaled for another course of food and drink.Servants appeared with langues de lapins de garenne  red wine and a sauce of mushroom yeast on the side.Slowly, the dinner conversation resumed, but Jessica heard the agitation in it, the brittle quality, saw that the banker ate in sullen silence.Kynes would have killed him without hesitating, she thought.And she realized that there was an offhand attitude toward killing in Kynes manner.He was a casual killer, and she guessed that this was a Fremen quality.Jessica turned to the stillsuit manufacturer on her left, said: I find myself continually amazed by the importance of water on Arrakis.Very important, he agreed.What is this dish?Its delicious.Tongues of wild rabbit in a special sauce, she said.A very old recipe.I must have that recipe, the man said.She nodded.Ill see that you get it.Kynes looked at Jessica, said: The newcomer to Arrakis frequently underestimates the importance of water here.You are dealing, you see, with the Law of the Minimum.She heard the testing quality in his voice, said, Growth is limited by that necessity which is present in the least amount.And, naturally, the least favorable condition controls the growth rate.Its rare to find members of a Great House aware of planetological problems, Kynes said.Water is the least favorable condition for life on Arrakis.And remember that growth itself can produce unfavorable conditions unless treated with extreme care.Jessica sensed a hidden message in Kynes words, but knew she was missing it.Growth, she said.Do you mean Arrakis can have an orderly cycle of water to sustain human life under more favorable conditions?Impossible!The water magnate barked.Jessica turned her attention to Bewt.Impossible?Impossible on Arrakis, he said.Dont listen to this dreamer.All the laboratory evidence is against him.Kynes looked at Bewt, and Jessica noted that the other conversations around the table had stopped while people concentrated on this new interchange.Laboratory evidence tends to blind us to a very simple fact, Kynes said.That fact is this: we are dealing here with matters that originated and exist out of doors where plants and animals carry on their normal existence.Normal!Bewt snorted.Nothing about Arrakis is normal!Quite the contrary, Kynes said.Certain harmonies could be set up here along self sustaining lines.You merely have to understand the limits of the planet and the pressures upon it.Itll never be done, Bewt said.The Duke came to a sudden realization, placing the point where Kynes attitude had changed  it had been when Jessica had spoken of holding the conservatory plants in trust for Arrakis.What would it take to set up the self sustaining system, Doctor Kynes?Leto asked.If we can get three per cent of the green plant element on Arrakis involved in forming carbon compounds as foodstuffs, weve started the cyclic system, Kynes said.Waters the only problem?the Duke asked.He sensed Kynes excitement, felt himself caught up in it.Water overshadows the other problems, Kynes said.This planet has much oxygen without its usual concomitants  widespread plant life and large sources of free carbon dioxide from such phenomena as volcanoes.There are unusual chemical interchanges over large surface areas here.Do you have pilot projects?the Duke asked.Weve had a long time in which to build up the Tansley Effect  small unit experiments on an amateur basis from which my science may now draw its working facts, Kynes said.There isnt enough water, Bewt said.There just isnt enough water.Master Bewt is an expert on water, Kynes said.He smiled, turned back to his dinner.The Duke gestured sharply down with his right hand, barked: No, I want an answer!Is there enough water, Doctor Kynes?Kynes stared at his plate.Jessica watched the play of emotion on his face.He masks himself well, she thought, but she had him registered now and read that he regretted his words.Is there enough water?the Duke demanded.There  may be, Kynes said.Hes faking uncertainty!Jessica thought.With his deeper truthsense, Paul caught the underlying motive, had to use every ounce of his training to mask his excitement.There is enough water!But Kynes doesnt wish it to be known.Our planetologist has many interesting dreams, Bewt said.He dreams with the Fremen  of prophecies and messiahs.Chuckles sounded at odd places around the table.Jessica marked them  the smuggler, the stillsuit manufacturers daughter, Duncan Idaho, the woman with the mysterious escort service.Tensions are oddly distributed here tonight, Jessica thought.Theres too much going on of which Im not aware.Ill have to develop new information sources.The Duke passed his gaze from Kynes to Bewt to Jessica.He felt oddly let down, as though something vital had passed him here.May be, he muttered.Kynes spoke quickly: Perhaps we should discuss this another time, my Lord.There are so many  The planetologist broke off as a uniformed Atreides trooper hurried in through the service door, was passed by the guard and rushed to the Dukes side.The man bent, whispering into Letos ear.Jessica recognized the capsign of Hawats corps, fought down uneasiness.She addressed herself to the stillsuit manufacturers feminine companion  a tiny, dark haired woman with a doll face, a touch of epicanthic fold to the eyes.Youve hardly touched your dinner, my dear, Jessica said.May I order you something?The woman looked at the stillsuit manufacturer before answering, then: Im not very hungry.Abruptly, the Duke stood up beside his trooper, spoke in a harsh tone of command: Stay seated, everyone.You will have to forgive me, but a matter has arisen that requires my personal attention.He stepped aside.Paul, take over as host for me, if you please.Paul stood, wanting to ask why his father had to leave, knowing he had to play this with the grand manner.He moved around to his fathers chair, sat down at it.The Duke turned to the alcove where Halleck sat, said: Gurney, please take Pauls place at table.We mustnt have an odd number here.When the dinners over, I may want you to bring Paul to the field C. P.  Wait for my Call.Halleck emerged from the alcove in dress uniform, his lumpy ugliness seeming out of place in the glittering finery.He leaned his baliset against the wall, crossed to the chair Paul had occupied, sat down.Theres no need for alarm, the Duke said, but I must ask that no one leave until our house guard says its safe.You will be perfectly secure as long as you remain here, and well have this little trouble cleared up very shortly.Paul caught the code words in his fathers message  guard safe secure shortly.The problem was security, not violence.He saw that his mother had read the same message.They both relaxed.The Duke gave a short nod, wheeled and strode through the service door followed by his trooper.Paul said: Please go on with your dinner.I believe Doctor Kynes was discussing water.May we discuss it another time?Kynes asked.By all means, Paul said.And Jessica noted with pride her sons dignity, the mature sense of assurance.The banker picked up his water flagon, gestured with it at Bewt.None of us here can surpass Master Lingar Bewt in flowery phrases.One might almost assume he aspired to Great House status.Come, Master Bewt, lead us in a toast.Perhaps youve a dollop of wisdom for the boy who must be treated like a man.Jessica clenched her right hand into a fist beneath the table.She saw a hand signal pass from Halleck to Idaho, saw the house troopers along the walls move into positions of maximum guard.Bewt cast a venomous glare at the banker.Paul glanced at Halleck, took in the defensive positions of his guards, looked at the banker until the man lowered the water flagon.He said: Once, on Caladan, I saw the body of a drowned fisherman recovered.He  Drowned?It was the stillsuit manufacturers daughter.Paul hesitated, then: Yes.Immersed in water until dead.Drowned.What an interesting way to die, she murmured.Pauls smile became brittle.He returned his attention to the banker.The interesting thing about this man was the wounds on his shoulders  made by another fishermans claw boots.This fisherman was one of several in a boat  a craft for travelling on water  that foundered  sank beneath the water.Another fisherman helping recover the body said hed seen marks like this mans wounds several times.They meant another drowning fisherman had tried to stand on this poor fellows shoulders in the attempt to reach up to the surface  to reach air.Why is this interesting?the banker asked.Because of an observation made by my father at the time.He said the drowning man who climbs on your shoulders to save himself is understandable  except when you see it happen in the drawing room.Paul hesitated just long enough for the banker to see the point coming, then: And, I should add, except when you see it at the dinner table.A sudden stillness enfolded the room.That was rash, Jessica thought.This banker might have enough rank to call my son out.She saw that Idaho was poised for instant action.The House troopers were alert.Gurney Halleck had his eyes on the men opposite him.Ho ho ho o o o!It was the smuggler, Tuek, head thrown back, laughing with complete abandon.Nervous smiles appeared around the table.Bewt was grinning.The banker had pushed his chair back, was glaring at Paul.Kynes said: One baits an Atreides at his own risk.Is it Atreides custom to insult their guests?the banker demanded.Before Paul could answer, Jessica leaned forward, said: Sir!And she thought: We must learn this Harkonnen creatures game.Is he here to try for Paul?Does he have help?My son displays a general garment and you claim its cut to your fit?Jessica asked.What a fascinating revelation.She slid a hand down her leg to the crysknife she had fastened in a calf sheath.The banker turned his glare at Jessica.Eyes shifted away from Paul and she saw him ease himself back from the table, freeing himself for action.He had focused on the code word: garment.Prepare for violence.Kynes directed a speculative look at Jessica, gave a subtle hand signal to Tuek.The smuggler lurched to his feet, lifted his flagon.Ill give you a toast, he said.To young Paul Atreides, still a lad by his looks, but a man by his actions.Why do they intrude?Jessica asked herself.The banker stared now at Kynes, and Jessica saw terror return to the agents face.People began responding all around the table.Where Kynes leads, people follow, Jessica thought.He has told us he sides with Paul.Whats the secret of his power?It cant be because hes Judge of the Change.Thats temporary.And certainly not because hes a civil servant.She removed her hand from the crysknife hilt, lifted her flagon to Kynes, who responded in kind.Only Paul and the banker  (Soo Soo!What an idiotic nickname!Jessica thought. )remained empty handed.The bankers attention stayed fixed on Kynes.Paul stared at his plate.I was handling it correctly, Paul thought.Why do they interfere?He glanced covertly at the male guests nearest him.Prepare for violence?From whom?Certainly not from that banker fellow.Halleck stirred, spoke as though to no one in particular, directing his words over the heads of the guests across from him: In our society, people shouldnt be quick to take offense.Its frequently suicidal.He looked at the stillsuit manufacturers daughter beside him.Dont you think so, miss?Oh, yes.Yes.Indeed I do, she said.Theres too much violence.It makes me sick.And lots of times no offense is meant, but people die anyway.It doesnt make sense.Indeed it doesnt, Halleck said.Jessica saw the near perfection of the girls act, realized: That empty headed little female is not an empty headed little female.She saw then the pattern of the threat and understood that Halleck, too, had detected it.They had planned to lure Paul with sex.Jessica relaxed.Her son had probably been first to see it  his training hadnt overlooked the obvious gambit.Kynes spoke to the banker: Isnt another apology in order?
