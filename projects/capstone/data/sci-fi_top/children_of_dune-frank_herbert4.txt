Well...they'd believed Liet Kynes, but he'd set a forty generation timescale.That was no accomplishment; that was a dream which, he saw now, had also turned inward.Muad'Dib had changed that!During the Jihad, Fremen had learned much about the old Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV.The eighty first Padishah of House Corrino to occupy the Golden Lion Throne and reign over this Imperium of uncounted worlds had used Arrakis as a testing place for those policies which he hoped to implement in the rest of his empire.His planetary governors on Arrakis had cultivated a persistent pessimism to bolster their power base.They'd made sure that everyone on Arrakis, even the free roaming Fremen, became familiar with numerous cases of injustice and insoluble problems; they had been taught to think of themselves as a helpless people for whom there was no succor."How beautiful the young women are this year!"As he watched Leto's retreating back, Stilgar began to wonder how the youth had set these thoughts flowing   and just by uttering a seemingly simple statement.Because of that statement, Stilgar found himself viewing Alia and his own role on the Council in an entirely different way.Alia was fond of saying that old ways gave ground slowly.Stilgar admitted to himself that he'd always found this statement vaguely reassuring.Change was dangerous.Invention must be suppressed.Individual willpower must be denied.What other function did the priesthood serve than to deny individual will?Alia kept saying that opportunities for open competition had to be reduced to manageable limits.But that meant the recurrent threat of technology could only be used to confine populations   just as it had served its ancient masters.Any permitted technology had to be rooted in ritual.Otherwise...otherwise...Again Stilgar stumbled.He was at the qanat now and saw Leto waiting beneath the apricot orchard which grew along the flowing water.Stilgar heard his feet moving through uncut grass.Uncut grass!What can I believe?Stilgar asked himself.It was proper for a Fremen of his generation to believe that individuals needed a profound sense of their own limitations.Traditions were surely the most controlling element in a secure society.People had to know the boundaries of their time, of their society, of their territory.What was wrong with the sietch as a model for all thinking?A sense of enclosure should pervade every individual choice   should fence in the family, the community, and every step taken by a proper government.Stilgar came to a stop and stared across the orchard at Leto.The youth stood there, regarding him with a smile.Does he know the turmoil in my head?Stilgar wondered.And the old Fremen Naib tried to fall back on the traditional catechism of his people.Each aspect of life required a single form, its inherent circularity based on secret inner knowledge of what will work and what will not work.The model for life, for the community, for every element of the larger society right up to and beyond the peaks of government   that model had to be the sietch and its counterpart in the sand: Shai Hulud.The giant sandworm was surely a most formidable creature, but when threatened it hid in the impenetrable deeps.Change is dangerous!Stilgar told himself.Sameness and stability were the proper goals of government.But the young men and women were beautiful.And they remembered the words of Muad'Dib as he deposed Shaddam IV: "It's not long life to the Emperor that I seek; it's long life to the Imperium. "Isn't that what I've been saying to myself?Stilgar wondered.He resumed walking, headed toward the sietch entrance slightly to Leto's right.The youth moved to intercept him.Muad'Dib had said another thing, Stilgar reminded himself: "just as individuals are born, mature, breed, and die, so do societies and civilizations and governments. "Dangerous or not, there would be change.The beautiful young Fremen knew this.They could look outward and see it, prepare for it.Stilgar was forced to stop.It was either that or walk right over Leto.The youth peered up at him owlishly, said: "You see, Stil?Tradition isn't the absolute guide you thought it was. "= = = = = =   A Fremen dies when he is too long from the desert; this we call "the water sickness. "Stilgar, the Commentaries   "It is difficult for me, asking you to do this," Alia said."But...I must insure that there's an empire for Paul's children to inherit.There's no other reason for the Regency. "Alia turned from where she was seated at a mirror completing her morning toilet.She looked at her husband, measuring how he absorbed these words.Duncan Idaho deserved careful study in these moments; there was no doubt that he'd become something far more subtle and dangerous than the one time swordmaster of House Atreides.The outer appearance remained similar   the black goat hair over sharp dark features   but in the long years since his awakening from the ghola state he had undergone an inner metamorphosis.She wondered now, as she had wondered many times, what the ghola rebirth after death might have hidden in the secret loneliness of him.Before the Tleilaxu had worked their subtle science on him, Duncan's reactions had borne clear labels for the Atreides   loyalty, fanatic adherence to the moral code of his mercenary forebears, swift to anger and swift to recover.He had been implacable in his resolve for revenge against House Harkonnen.And he had died saving Paul.But the Tleilaxu had bought his body from the Sardaukar and, in their regeneration vats, they had grown a zombie katrundo: the flesh of Duncan Idaho, but none of his conscious memories.He'd been trained as a mentat and sent as a gift, a human computer for Paul, a fine tool equipped with a hypnotic compulsion to slay his owner.The flesh of Duncan Idaho had resisted that compulsion and, in the intolerable stress, his cellular past had come back to him.Alia had decided long ago that it was dangerous to think of him as Duncan in the privacy of her thoughts.Better to think of him by his ghola name, Hayt.Far better.And it was essential that he get not the slightest glimpse of the old Baron Harkonnen sitting there in her mind.Duncan saw Alia studying him, turned away.Love could not hide the changes in her, nor conceal from him the transparency of her motives.The many faceted metal eyes which the Tleilaxu had given him were cruel in their ability to penetrate deception.They limned her now as a gloating, almost masculine figure, and he could not stand to see her thus."Why do you turn away?"Alia asked."I must think about this thing," he said."The Lady Jessica is...an Atreides. ""And your loyalty is to House Atreides, not to me," Alia pouted."Don't put such fickle interpretations into me," he said.Alia pursed her lips.Had she moved too rapidly?Duncan crossed to the chambered opening which looked down on a corner of the Temple plaza.He could see pilgrims beginning to gather there, the Arrakeen traders moving in to feed on the edges like a pack of predators upon a herd of beasts.He focused on a particular group of tradesmen, spice fiber baskets over their arms, Fremen mercenaries a pace behind them.They moved with a stolid force through the gathering throng."They sell pieces of etched marble," he said, pointing."Did you know that?They set the pieces out in the desert to be etched by stormsands.Sometimes they find interesting patterns in the stone.They call it a new art form, very popular: genuine storm etched marble from Dune.I bought a piece of it last week   a golden tree with five tassels, lovely but very fragile. ""Don't change the subject," Alia said."I haven't changed the subject," he said."It's beautiful, but it's not art.Humans create art by their own violence, by their own volition. "He put his right hand on the windowsill."The twins detest this city and I'm afraid I see their point. ""I fail to see the association," Alia said."The abduction of my mother is not a real abduction.She will be safe as your captive. ""This city was built by the blind," he said."Did you know that Leto and Stilgar went out from Sietch Tabr into the desert last week?They were gone the whole night. ""It was reported to me," she said."These baubles from the sand   would you have me prohibit their sale?""That'd be bad for business," he said, turning."Do you know what Stilgar said when I asked why they went out on the sand that way?He said Leto wished to commune with the spirit of Muad'Dib. "Alia felt the sudden coldness of panic, looked in the mirror a moment to recover.Leto would not venture from the sietch at night for such nonsense.Was it a conspiracy?Idaho put a hand over his eyes to blot out the sight of her, said: "Stilgar told me he went along with Leto because he still believes in Muad'Dib. ""Of course he does!"Idaho chuckled, a hollow sound."He said he still believes because Muad'Dib was always for the little people. ""What did you say to that?"Alia asked, her voice betraying her fear.Idaho dropped his hand from his eyes."I said, 'That must make you one of the little people. '"  "Duncan!That's a dangerous game.Bait that Fremen Naib and you could awaken a beast to destroy us all. ""He still believes in Muad'Dib," Idaho said."That's our protection. ""What was his reply?""He said he knew his own mind. ""I see. ""No...I don't believe you do.Things that bite have longer teeth than Stilgar's. ""I don't understand you today, Duncan.I ask you to do a very important thing, a thing vital to...What is all of this rambling?"How petulant she sounded.He turned back to the chambered window."When I was trained as a mentat...It is very difficult, Alia, to learn how to work your own mind.You learn first that the mind must be allowed to work itself.That's very strange.You can work your own muscles, exercise them, strengthen them, but the mind acts of itself.Sometimes, when you have learned this about the mind, it shows you things you do not want to see. ""And that's why you tried to insult Stilgar?""Stilgar doesn't know his own mind; he doesn't let it run free. ""Except in the spice orgy. ""Not even there.That's what makes him a Naib.To be a leader of men, he controls and limits his reactions.He does what is expected of him.Once you know this, you know Stilgar and you can measure the length of his teeth. ""That's the Fremen way," she said."Well, Duncan, will you do it, or won't you?She must be taken and it must be made to look like the work of House Corrino. "He remained silent, weighing her tone and arguments in his mentat way.This abduction plan spoke of a coldness and a cruelty whose dimensions, thus revealed, shocked him.Risk her own mother's life for the reasons thus far produced?Alia was lying.Perhaps the whisperings about Alia and Javid were true.This thought produced an icy hardness in his stomach."You're the only one I can trust for this," Alia said."I know that," he said.She took this as acceptance, smiled at herself in the mirror."You know," Idaho said, "the mentat learns to look at every human as a series of relationships. "Alia did not respond.She sat, caught in a personal memory which drew a blank expression on her face.Idaho, glancing over his shoulder at her, saw the expression and shuddered.It was as though she communed with voices heard only by herself."Relationships," he whispered.And he thought: One must cast off old agonies as a snake casts off its skin   only to grow a new set and accept all of their limitations.It was the same with governments   even the Regency.Old governments can be traced like discarded molts.I must carry out this scheme, but not in the way Alia commands.Presently Alia shook her shoulders, said: "Leto should not be going out like that in these times.I will reprimand him. ""Not even with Stilgar?""Not even with him. "She arose from her mirror, crossed to where Idaho stood beside the window, put a hand on his arm.He repressed a shiver, reduced this reaction to a mentat computation.Something in her revolted him.Something in her.He could not bring himself to look at her.He smelled the melange of her cosmetics, cleared his throat.She said: "I will be busy today examining Farad'n's gifts. ""The clothing?""Yes.Nothing he does is what it seems.And we must remember that his Bashar, Tyekanik, is an adept of chaumurky, chaumas, and all the other subtleties of royal assassination. ""The price of power," he said, pulling away from her."But we're still mobile and Farad'n is not. "She studied his chiseled profile.Sometimes the workings of his mind were difficult to fathom.Was he thinking only that freedom of action gave life to a military power?Well, life on Arrakis had been too secure for too long.Senses once whetted by omnipresent dangers could degenerate when not used."Yes," she said, "we still have the Fremen. ""Mobility," he repeated."We cannot degenerate into infantry.That'd be foolish. "His tone annoyed her, and she said: "Farad'n will use any means to destroy us. ""Ahhh, that's it," he said."That's a form of initiative, a mobility which we didn't have in the old days.We had a code, the code of House Atreides.We always paid our way and let the enemy be the pillagers.That restriction no longer holds, of course.We're equally mobile.House Atreides and House Corrino. ""We abduct my mother to save her from harm as much as for any other reason," Alia said."We still live by the code!"He looked down at her.She knew the dangers of inciting a mentat to compute.Didn't she realize what he had computed?Yet...he still loved her.He brushed a hand across his eyes.How youthful she looked.The Lady Jessica was correct: Alia gave the appearance of not having aged a day in their years together.She still possessed the soft features of her Bene Gesserit mother, but her eyes were Atreides   measuring, demanding, hawklike.And now something possessed of cruel calculation lurked behind those eyes.Idaho had served House Atreides for too many years not to understand the family's strengths as well as their weaknesses.But this thing in Alia, this was new.The Atreides might play a devious game against enemies, but never against friends and allies, and not at all against Family.It was ground into the Atreides manner: support your own populace to the best of your ability; show them how much better they lived under the Atreides.Demonstrate your love for your friends by the candor of your behavior with them.What Alia asked now, though, was not Atreides.He felt this with all of his body's flesh and nerve structure.He was a unit, indivisible, feeling this alien attitude in Alia.Abruptly his mentat sensorium clicked into full awareness and his mind leaped into the frozen trance where Time did not exist; only the computation existed.Alia would recognize what had happened to him, but that could not be helped.He gave himself up to the computation.Computation: A reflected Lady Jessica lived out a pseudo life in Alia's awareness.He saw this as he saw the reflected pre ghola Duncan Idaho which remained a constant in his own awareness.Alia had this awareness by being one of the pre born.He had it out of the Tleilaxu regeneration tanks.Yet Alia denied that reflection, risked her mother's life.Therefore Alia was not in contact with that pseudo Jessica within.Therefore Alia was completely possessed by another pseudo life to the exclusion of all others.Possessed!Alien!Abomination!Mentat fashion, he accepted this, turned to other facets of his problem.All of the Atreides were on this one planet.Would House Corrino risk attack from space?His mind flashed through the review of those conventions which had ended primitive forms of warfare:  One   All planets were vulnerable to attack from space; ergo: retaliation / revenge facilities were set up off planet by every House Major.Farad'n would know that the Atreides had not omitted this elementary precaution.Two   Force shields were a complete defense against projectiles and explosives of non atomic type, the basic reason why hand to hand conflict had reentered human combat.But infantry had its limits.House Corrino might have brought their Sardaukar back to a pre Arrakeen edge, but they still could be no match for the abandoned ferocity of Fremen.Three   Planetary feudalism remained in constant danger from a large technical class, but the effects of the Butlerian Jihad continued as a damper on technological excesses.Ixians, Tleilaxu, and a few scattered outer planets were the only possible threat in this regard, and they were planet vulnerable to the combined wrath of the rest of the Imperium.The Butlerian Jihad would not be undone.Mechanized warfare required a large technical class.The Atreides Imperium had channeled this force into other pursuits.No large technical class existed unwatched.And the Empire remained safely feudalist, naturally, since that was the best social form for spreading over widely dispersed wild frontiers   new planets.Duncan felt his mentat awareness coruscate as it shot through memory data of itself, completely impervious to the passage of time.Arriving at the conviction that House Corrino would not risk an illegal atomic attack, he did this in flash computation, the main decisional pathway, but he was perfectly aware of the elements which went into this conviction: The Imperium commanded as many nuclear and allied weapons as all the Great Houses combined.At least half the Great Houses would react without thinking if House Corrino broke the Convention.The Atreides off planet retaliation system would be joined by overwhelming force, and no need to summon any of them.Fear would do the calling.Salusa Secundus and its allies would vanish in hot clouds.House Corrino would not risk such a holocaust.They were undoubtedly sincere in subscribing to the argument that nuclear weapons were a reserve held for one purpose: defense of humankind should a threatening "other intelligence" ever be encountered.The computational thoughts had clean edges, sharp relief.There were no blurred between places.Alia chose abduction and terror because she had become alien, non Atreides.House Corrino was a threat, but not in the ways which Alia argued in Council.Alia wanted the Lady Jessica removed because that searing Bene Gesserit intelligence had seen what only now had become clear to him.Idaho shook himself out of the mentat trance, saw Alia standing in front of him, a coldly measuring expression on her face."Wouldn't you rather the Lady Jessica were killed?"he asked.The alien flash of her joy lay exposed before his eyes for a brief instant before being covered by false outrage."Duncan!"Yes, this alien Alia preferred matricide."You are afraid of your mother, not for her," he said.She spoke without a change in her measuring stare."Of course I am.She has reported about me to the Sisterhood. ""What do you mean?""Don't you know the greatest temptation for a Bene Gesserit?"She moved closer to him, seductive, looked upward at him through her lashes."I thought only to keep myself strong and alert for the sake of the twins. ""You speak of temptation," he said, his voice mentat flat."It's the thing which the Sisterhood hides most deeply, the thing they most fear.It's why they call me Abomination.They know their inhibitions won't hold me back.Temptation   they always speak with heavy emphasis: Great Temptation.You see, we who employ the Bene Gesserit teachings can influence such things as the internal adjustment of enzyme balance within our bodies.It can prolong youth   far longer than with melange.Do you see the consequences should many Bene Gesserits do this?It would be noticed.I'm sure you compute the accuracy of what I'm saying.Melange is what makes us the target for so many plots.We control a substance which prolongs life.What if it became known that Bene Gesserits controlled an even more potent secret?You see!Not one Reverend Mother would be safe.Abduction and torture of Bene Gesserits would become a most common activity. ""You've accomplished this enzyme balancing. "It was a statement, not a question."I've defied the Sisterhood!My mother's reports to the Sisterhood will make the Bene Gesserits unswerving allies of House Corrino. "How very plausible, he thought.He tested: "But surely your own mother would not turn against you!""She was Bene Gesserit long before she was my mother, Duncan, she permitted her own son, my brother, to undergo the test of the gom jabbar!She arranged it!And she knew he might not survive it!Bene Gesserits have always been short on faith and long on pragmatism.She'll act against me if she believes it's in the best interests of the Sisterhood. "He nodded.How convincing she was.It was a sad thought."We must hold the initiative," she said."That's our sharpest weapon. ""There's the problem of Gurney Halleck," he said."Do I have to kill my old friend?""Gurney's off on some spy errand in the desert," she said, knowing Idaho already was aware of this."He's safely out of the way. ""Very odd," he said, "the Regent Governor of Caladan running errands here on Arrakis. ""Why not?"Alia demanded."He's her lover   in his dreams if not in fact. ""Yes, of course. "And he wondered that she did not hear the insincerity in his voice."When will you abduct her?"Alia asked."It's better that you don't know. ""Yes...yes, I see.Where'll you take her?""Where she cannot be found.Depend upon it; she won't be left here to threaten you. "The glee in Alia's eyes could not be mistaken."But where will... ""If you do not know, then you can answer before a Truthsayer, if necessary, that you do not know where she is. ""Ahhh, clever, Duncan. "Now she believes I will kill the Lady Jessica, he thought.And he said: "Goodbye, beloved. "She did not hear the finality in his voice, even kissed him lightly as he left.And all the way down through the sietchlike maze of Temple corridors, Idaho brushed at his eyes.Tleilaxu eyes were not immune to tears.= = = = = =   You have loved Caladan And lamented its lost host   But pain discovers New lovers cannot erase Those forever ghost.Refrain from The Habbanya Lament   Stilgar quadrupled the sietch guard around the twins, but he knew it was useless.The lad was like his Atreides namesake, the grandfather Leto.Everyone who'd known the original Duke remarked on it.Leto had the measuring look about him, and caution, yes, but all of it had to be evaluated against that latent wildness, the susceptibility to dangerous decisions.Ghanima was more like her mother.There was Chani's red hair, the set of Chani's eyes, and a calculating way about her when she adjusted to difficulties.She often said that she only did what she had to do, but where Leto led she would follow.And Leto was going to lead them into danger.Not once did Stilgar think of taking his problem to Alia.That ruled out Irulan, who ran to Alia with anything and everything.In coming to his decision, Stilgar realized he had accepted the possibility that Leto judged Alia correctly.She uses people in a casual and callous way, he thought.She even uses Duncan that way.It isn't so much that she'd turn on me and kill me.She'd discard me.Meanwhile the guard was strengthened and Stilgar stalked his sietch like a robed specter, prying everywhere.All the time, his mind seethed with the doubts Leto had planted there.If one could not depend upon tradition, then where was the rock upon which to anchor his life?On the afternoon of the Convocation of Welcome for the Lady Jessica, Stilgar spied Ghanima standing with her grandmother at the entrance lip to the sietch's great assembly chamber.It was early and Alia had not yet arrived, but people already were thronging into the chamber, casting surreptitious glances at the child and adult as they passed.Stilgar paused in a shadowed alcove out of the crowd flow and watched the pair of them, unable to hear their words above the murmuring throb of an assembling multitude.The people of many tribes would be here today to welcome back their old Reverend Mother.But he stared at Ghanima.Her eyes, the way they danced when she spoke!The movement fascinated him.Those deep blue, steady, demanding, measuring eyes.And that way of throwing her red gold hair off her shoulder with a twist of the head: that was Chani.It was a ghostly resurrection, an uncanny resemblance.Slowly Stilgar drew closer and took up his station in another alcove.He could not associate Ghanima's observing manner with any other child of his experience   except her brother.Where was Leto?Stilgar glanced back up the crowded passage.His guards would have spread an alarm if anything were amiss.He shook his head.These twins assaulted his sanity.They were a constant abrasion against his peace of mind.He could almost hate them.Kin were not immune from one's hatred, but blood (and its precious water) carried demands for one's countenance which transcended most other concerns.These twins existed as his greatest responsibility.Dust filtered brown light came from the cavernous assembly chamber beyond Ghanima and Jessica.It touched the child's shoulders and the new white robe she wore, backlighting her hair as she turned to peer into the passage at the people thronging past.Why did Leto afflict me with these doubts?he wondered.There was no doubt that it had been done deliberately.Perhaps Leto wanted me to have a small share of his own mental experience.Stilgar knew why the twins were different, but had always found his reasoning processes unable to accept what he knew.He had never experienced the womb as prison to an awakened consciousness   a living awareness from the second month of gestation, so it was said.Leto had once said that his memory was like "an internal holograph, expanding in size and in detail from that original shocked awakening, but never changing shape or outline. "For the first time, as he watched Ghanima and the Lady Jessica, Stilgar began to understand what it must be like to live in such a scrambled web of memories, unable to retreat or find a sealed room of the mind.Faced with such a condition, one had to integrate madness, to select and reject from a multitude of offerings in a system where answers changed as fast as the question.There could be no fixed tradition.There could be no absolute answers to double faced questions.What works?That which does not work.What does not work?That which works.He recognized this pattern.It was the old Fremen game of riddles.Question: "It brings death and life. "Answer: "The Coriolis wind. "Why did Leto want me to understand this?Stilgar asked himself.From his cautious probings, Stilgar knew that the twins shared a common view of their difference: they thought of it as affliction.The birth canal would be a draining place to such a one, he thought.Ignorance reduces the shock of some experiences, but they would have no ignorance about birth.What would it be like to live a life where you knew all of the things that could go wrong?You would face a constant war with doubts.You would resent your difference from your fellows.It would be pleasant to inflict others with even a taste of that difference."Why me?"would be your first unanswered question.And what have I been asking myself?Stilgar thought.A wry smile touched his lips.Why me?Seeing the twins in this new way, he understood the dangerous chances they took with their uncompleted bodies.Ghanima had put it to him succinctly once after he'd berated her for climbing the precipitous west face to the rim above Sietch Tabr."Why should I fear death?I've been there before   many times. "How can I presume to teach such children?Stilgar wondered.How can anyone presume?Oddly, Jessica's thoughts were moving in a similar vein as she talked to her granddaughter.She'd been thinking how difficult it must be to carry mature minds in immature bodies.The body would have to learn what the mind already knew it could do   aligning responses and reflexes.The old Bene Gesserit prana bindu regimen would be available to them, but even there the mind would run where the flesh could not.Gurney had a supremely difficult task carrying out her orders."Stilgar is watching us from an alcove back there," Ghanima said.Jessica did not turn.But she found herself confounded by what she heard in Ghanima's voice.Ghanima loved the old Fremen as one would love a parent.Even while she spoke lightly of him and teased him, she loved him.The realization forced Jessica to see the old Naib in a new light, understanding in a gestalten revelation what the twins and Stilgar shared.This new Arrakis did not fit Stilgar well, Jessica realized.No more than this new universe fitted her grandchildren.Unwanted and undemanded, a Bene Gesserit saying flowed through Jessica's mind: "To suspect your own mortality is to know the beginning of terror; to learn irrefutably that you are mortal is to know the end of terror. "Yes, death would not be a hard yoke to wear, but life was a slow fire to Stilgar and the twins.Each found an ill fitting world and longed for other ways where variations might be known without threat.They were children of Abraham, learning more from a hawk stooping over the desert than from any book yet written.Leto had confounded Jessica only that morning as they'd stood beside the qanat which flowed below the sietch.He'd said: "Water traps us, grandmother.We'd be better off living like dust because then the wind could carry us higher than the highest cliffs of the Shield Wall. "Although she was familiar with such devious maturity from the mouths of these children, Jessica had been caught by this utterance, but had managed: "Your father might've said that. "And Leto, throwing a handful of sand into the air to watch it fall: "Yes, he might've.But my father did not consider then how quickly water makes everything fall back to the ground from which it came. "Now, standing beside Ghanima in the sietch, Jessica felt the shock of those words anew.She turned, glanced back at the still flowing throng, let her gaze wander across Stilgar's shadowy shape in the alcove.Stilgar was no tame Fremen, trained only to carry twigs to the nest.He was still a hawk.When he thought of the color red, he did not think of flowers but of blood."You're so quiet, suddenly," Ghanima said."Is something wrong?"Jessica shook her head."It's something Leto said this morning, that's all. ""When you went out to the plantings?What'd he say?"Jessica thought of the curious look of adult wisdom which had come over Leto's face out there in the morning.It was the same look which came over Ghanima's face right now."He was recalling the time when Gurney came back from the smugglers to the Atreides banner," Jessica said."Then you were talking about Stilgar," Ghanima said.Jessica did not question how this insight occurred.The twins appeared capable of reproducing each other's thought trains at will."Yes, we were," Jessica said."Stilgar didn't like to hear Gurney calling...Paul his Duke, but Gurney's presence forced this upon all of the Fremen.Gurney kept saying 'My Duke. '"  "I see," Ghanima said."And of course, Leto observed that he was not yet Stilgar's Duke. ""That's right. ""You know what he was doing to you, of course," Ghanima said."I'm not sure I do," Jessica admitted, and she found this admission particularly disturbing because it had not occurred to her that Leto was doing anything at all to her."He was trying to ignite your memories of our father," Ghanima said."Leto's always hungry to know our father from the viewpoints of others who knew him. ""But...doesn't Leto have... ""Oh, he can listen to the inner life.Certainly.But that's not the same.You spoke about him, of course.Our father, I mean.You spoke of him as your son. ""Yes. "Jessica clipped it off.She did not like the feeling that these twins could turn her on and off at will, open her memories for observation, touch any emotion which attracted their interest.Ghanima might be doing that right now!"Leto said something to disturb you," Ghanima said.Jessica found herself shocked at the necessity to suppress anger."Yes...he did. ""You don't like the fact that he knows our father as our mother knew him, and knows our mother as our father knew her," Ghanima said."You don't like what that implies   what we may know about you. ""I'd never really thought about it that way before," Jessica said, finding her voice stiff."It's the knowledge of sensual things which usually disturbs," Ghanima said."It's your conditioning.You find it extremely difficult to think of us as anything but children.But there's nothing our parents did together, in public or in private, that we would not know. "For a brief instant Jessica found herself returning to the reaction which had come over her out there beside the qanat, but now she focused that reaction upon Ghanima."He probably spoke of your Duke's 'rutting sensuality,' " Ghanima said."Sometimes Leto needs a bridle on his mouth!"Is there nothing these twins cannot profane?Jessica wondered, moving from shock to outrage to revulsion.How dared they speak of her Leto's sensuality?Of course a man and woman who loved each other would share the pleasure of their bodies!It was a private and beautiful thing, not to be paraded in casual conversation between a child and an adult.Child and adult!Abruptly Jessica realized that neither Leto nor Ghanima had done this casually.As Jessica remained silent, Ghanima said: "We've shocked you.I apologize for both of us.Knowing Leto, I know he didn't consider apologizing.Sometimes when he's following a particular scent, he forgets how different we are...from you, for instance. "Jessica thought: And that is why you both do this, of course.You are teaching me!And she wondered then: Who else are you teaching?Stilgar?Duncan?"Leto tries to see things as you see them," Ghanima said."Memories are not enough.When you try the hardest, just then, you most often fail. "Jessica sighed.Ghanima touched her grandmother's arm."Your son left many things unsaid which yet must be said, even to you.Forgive us, but he loved you.Don't you know that?"Jessica turned away to hide the tears glistening in her eyes."He knew your fears," Ghanima said."Just as he knew Stilgar's fears.Dear Stil.Our father was his 'Doctor of Beasts' and Stil was no more than the green snail hidden in its shell. "She hummed the tune from which she'd taken these words.The music hurled the lyrics against Jessica's awareness without compromise:  		"O Doctor of Beasts, 		To a green snail shell 		With its timid miracle 		Hidden, awaiting death, 		You come as a deity!Even snails know 		That gods obliterate, 		And cures bring pain, 		That heaven is seen 		Through a door of flame.O Doctor of Beasts, 		I am the man snail 		Who sees your single eye 		Peering into my shell!Why, Muad'Dib?Why?"Ghanima said: "Unfortunately, our father left many man snails in our universe. "= = = = = =   The assumption that humans exist within an essentially impermanent universe, taken as an operational precept, demands that the intellect become a totally aware balancing instrument.But the intellect cannot react thus without involving the entire organism.Such an organism may be recognized by its burning, driving behavior.And thus it is with a society treated as organism.But here we encounter an old inertia.Societies move to the goading of ancient, reactive impulses.They demand permanence.Any attempt to display the universe of impermanence arouses rejection patterns, fear, anger, and despair.Then how do we explain the acceptance of prescience?Simply: the giver of prescient visions, because he speaks of an absolute (permanent) realization, may be greeted with joy by humankind even while predicting the most dire events.The Book of Leto, After Harq al Ada   "It's liking fighting in the dark," Alia said.She paced the Council Chamber in angry strides, moving from the tall silvery draperies which softened the morning sun at the eastern windows to the divans grouped beneath decorated wall panels at the room's opposite end.Her sandals crossed spice fiber rugs, parquet wood, tiles of giant garnet and once more, rugs.At last she stood over Irulan and Idaho, who sat facing each other on divans of grey whale fur.Idaho had resisted returning from Tabr, but she had sent peremptory orders.The abduction of Jessica was more important than ever now, but it had to wait.Idaho's mentat perceptions were required."These things are cut from the same pattern," Alia said."They stink of a far reaching plot. ""Perhaps not," Irulan ventured, but she glanced questioningly at Idaho.Alia's face lapsed into an undisguised sneer.How could Irulan be that innocent?Unless...Alia bent a sharp and questioning stare onto the Princess.Irulan wore a simple black aba robe which matched the shadows in her spice indigo eyes.Her blonde hair was tied in a tight coil at the nape of her neck, accenting a face thinned and toughened by years on Arrakis.She still retained the haughtiness she'd learned in the court of her father, Shaddam IV, and Alia often felt that this prideful attitude could mask the thoughts of a conspirator.Idaho lounged in the black and green uniform of an Atreides House Guard, no insignia.It was an affectation which was secretly resented by many of Alia's actual guards, especially the amazons, who gloried in insignia of office.They did not like the plain presence of the ghola swordmaster mentat, the more so because he was the husband of their mistress."So the tribes want the Lady Jessica reinstated into the Regency Council," Idaho said."How can that  "  "They make unanimous demand!"Alia said, pointing to an embossed sheet of spice paper on the divan beside Irulan."Farad'n is one thing, but this...this has the stink of other alignments!""What does Stilgar think?"Irulan asked."His signature's on that paper!"Alia said."But if he... ""How could he deny the mother of his god?"Alia sneered.Idaho looked up at her, thinking: That's awfully close to the edge with Irulan!Again he wondered why Alia had brought him back here when she knew that he was needed at Sietch Tabr if the abduction plot were to be carried off.Was it possible she'd heard about the message sent to him by The Preacher?This thought filled his breast with turmoil.How could that mendicant mystic know the secret signal by which Paul Atreides had always summoned his swordmaster?Idaho longed to leave this pointless meeting and return to the search for an answer to that question."There's no doubt that The Preacher has been off planet," Alia said."The Guild wouldn't dare deceive us in such a thing.I will have him  "  "Careful!"Irulan said."Indeed, have a care," Idaho said."Half the planet believe him to be  " He shrugged.  "your brother. "And Idaho hoped he had carried this off with a properly casual attitude.How had the man known that signal?"But if he's a courier, or a spy of the  "  "He's made contact with no one from CHOAM or House Corrino," Irulan said."We can be sure of  "  "We can be sure of nothing!"Alia did not try to hide her scorn.She turned her back on Irulan, faced Idaho.He knew why he was here!Why didn't he perform as expected?He was in Council because Irulan was here.The history which had brought a Princess of House Corrino into the Atreides fold could never be forgotten.Allegiance, once changed, could change again.Duncan's mentat powers should be searching for flaws, for subtle deviations in Irulan's behavior.Idaho stirred, glanced at Irulan.There were times when he resented the straight line necessities imposed on mentat performance.He knew what Alia was thinking.Irulan would know it as well.But this Princess wife to Paul Muad'Dib had overcome the decisions which had made her less than the royal concubine, Chani.There could be no doubt of Irulan's devotion to the royal twins.She had renounced family and Bene Gesserit in dedication to the Atreides."My mother is part of this plot!"Alia insisted."For what other reason would the Sisterhood send her back here at a time such as this?""Hysteria isn't going to help us," Idaho said.Alia whirled away from him, as he'd known she would.It helped him that he did not have to look at that once beloved face which was now so twisted by alien possession."Well," Irulan said, "the Guild can't be completely trusted for  "  "The Guild!"Alia sneered."We can't rule out the enmity of the Guild or the Bene Gesserit," Idaho said."But we must assign them special categories as essentially passive combatants.The Guild will live up to its basic rule: Never Govern.They're a parasitic growth, and they know it.They won't do anything to kill the organism which keeps them alive. ""Their idea of which organism keeps them alive may be different from ours," Irulan drawled.It was the closest she ever came to a sneer, that lazy tone of voice which said: "You missed a point, mentat. "Alia appeared puzzled.She had not expected Irulan to take this tack.It was not the kind of view which a conspirator would want examined."No doubt," Idaho said."But the Guild won't come out overtly against House Atreides.The Sisterhood, on the other hand, might risk a certain kind of political break which  "  "If they do, it'll be through a front: someone or some group they can disavow," Irulan said."The Bene Gesserit haven't existed all of these centuries without knowing the value of self effacement.They prefer being behind the throne, not on it. "Self effacement?Alia wondered.Was that Irulan's choice?"Precisely the point I make about the Guild," Idaho said.He found the necessities of argument and explanation helpful.They kept his mind from other problems.Alia strode back toward the sunlit windows.She knew Idaho's blind spot; every mentat had it.They had to make pronouncements.This brought about a tendency to depend upon absolutes, to see finite limits.They knew this about themselves.It was part of their training.Yet they continued to act beyond self limiting parameters.I should've left him at Sietch Tabr, Alia thought.It would've been better to just turn Irulan over to Javid for questioning.Within her skull, Alia heard a rumbling voice: "Exactly!"Shut up!Shut up!Shut up!she thought.A dangerous mistake beckoned her in these moments and she could not recognize its outlines.All she could sense was the danger.Idaho had to help her out of this predicament.He was a mentat.Mentats were necessary.The human computer replaced the mechanical devices destroyed by the Butlerian Jihad.Thou shalt not make a machine in the likeness of a human mind!But Alia longed now for a compliant machine.They could not have suffered from Idaho's limitations.You could never distrust a machine.Alia heard Irulan's drawling voice."A feint within a feint within a feint within a feint," Irulan said."We all know the accepted pattern of attack upon power.I don't blame Alia for her suspicions.Of course she suspects everyone   even us.Ignore that for the moment, though.What remains as the prime arena of motives, the most fertile source of danger to the Regency?""CHOAM," Idaho said, his voice mentat flat.Alia allowed herself a grim smile.The Combine Honnete Ober Advancer Mercantiles!But House Atreides dominated CHOAM with fifty one percent of its shares.The Priesthood of Muad'Dib held another five percent, pragmatic acceptance by the Great Houses that Dune controlled the priceless melange.Not without reason was the spice often called "the secret coinage. "Without melange, the Spacing Guild's heighliners could not move.Melange precipitated the "navigation trance" by which a translight pathway could be "seen" before it was traveled.Without melange and its amplification of the human immunogenic system, life expectancy for the very rich degenerated by a factor of at least four.Even the vast middle class of the Imperium ate diluted melange in small sprinklings with at least one meal a day.But Alia had heard the mentat sincerity in Idaho's voice, a sound which she'd been awaiting with terrible expectancy.CHOAM.The Combine Honnete was much more than House Atreides, much more than Dune, much more than the Priesthood or melange.It was inkvines, whale fur, shigawire, Ixian artifacts and entertainers, trade in people and places, the Hajj, those products which came from the borderline legality of Tleilaxu technology; it was addictive drugs and medical techniques; it was transportation (the Guild) and all of the supercomplex commerce of an empire which encompassed thousands of known planets plus some which fed secretly at the fringes, permitted there for services rendered.When Idaho said CHOAM, he spoke of a constant ferment, intrigue within intrigue, a play of powers where the shift of one duodecimal point in interest payments could change the ownership of an entire planet.Alia returned to stand over the two seated on the divans."Something specific about CHOAM bothers you?"she asked."There's always the heavy speculative stockpiling of spice by certain Houses," Irulan said.Alia slapped her hands against her own thighs, then gestured at the embossed spice paper beside Irulan."That demand doesn't intrigue you, coming as it does  "  "All right!"Idaho barked."Out with it.What're you withholding?You know better than to deny the data and still expect me to function as  "  "There has been a recent very significant increase in trade for people with four specific specialties," Alia said.And she wondered if this would be truly new information for this pair."Which specialties?"Irulan asked."Swordmasters, twisted mentats from Tleilax, conditioned medics from the Suk school, and fincap accountants, most especially the latter.Why would questionable bookkeeping be in demand right now?"She directed the question at Idaho.Function as a mentat he thought.Well, that was better than dwelling on what Alia had become.He focused on her words, replaying them in his mind mentat fashion.Swordmasters?That had been his own calling once.Swordmasters were, of course, more than personal fighters.They could repair force shields, plan military campaigns, design military support facilities, improvise weapons.Twisted mentats?The Tleilaxu persisted in this hoax, obviously.As a mentat himself, Idaho knew the fragile insecurity of Tleilaxu twisting.Great Houses which bought such mentats hoped to control them absolutely.Impossible!Even Piter de Vries, who'd served the Harkonnens in their assault on House Atreides, had maintained his own essential dignity, accepting death rather than surrender his inner core of selfdom at the end.Suk doctors?Their conditioning supposedly guaranteed them against disloyalty to their owner patients.Suk doctors came very expensive.Increased purchase of Suks would involve substantial exchanges of funds.Idaho weighed these facts against an increase in fincap accountants."Prime computation," he said, indicating a heavily weighted assurance that he spoke of inductive fact."There's been a recent increase in wealth among Houses Minor.Some have to be moving quietly toward Great House status.Such wealth could only come from some specific shifts in political alignments. ""We come at last to the Landsraad," Alia said, voicing her own belief."The next Landsraad session is almost two standard years away," Irulan reminded her."But political bargaining never ceases," Alia said."And I'll warrant some among those tribal signatories  " She gestured at the paper beside Irulan.  "are among the Houses Minor who've shifted their alignment. ""Perhaps," Irulan said."The Landsraad," Alia said."What better front for the Bene Gesserits?And what better agent for the Sisterhood than my own mother?"Alia planted herself directly in front of Idaho."Well, Duncan?"Why not function as a mentat?Idaho asked himself.He saw the tenor of Alia's suspicions now.After all, Duncan Idaho had been personal house guard to the Lady Jessica for many years."Duncan?"Alia pressed."You should inquire closely after any advisory legislation which may be under preparation for the next session of the Landsraad," Idaho said."They might take the legal position that a Regency can't veto certain kinds of legislation   specifically, adjustments of taxation and the policing of cartels.There are others, but... ""Not a very good pragmatic bet on their part if they take that position," Irulan said."I agree," Alia said."The Sardaukar have no teeth and we still have our Fremen legions. ""Careful, Alia," Idaho said."Our enemies would like nothing better than to make us appear monstrous.No matter how many legions you command, power ultimately rides on popular sufferance in an empire as scattered as this one. ""Popular sufferance?"Irulan asked."You mean Great House sufferance," Alia said."And how many Great Houses will we face under this new alliance?"Idaho asked."Money is collecting in strange places!""The fringes?"Irulan asked.Idaho shrugged.It was an unanswerable question.All of them suspected that one day the Tleilaxu or technological tinkerers on the Imperial fringes would nullify the Holtzmann Effect.On that day, shields would be useless.The whole precarious balance which maintained planetary feudatories would collapse.Alia refused to consider that possibility."We'll ride with what we have," she said."And what we have is a certain knowledge throughout the CHOAM directorate that we can destroy the spice if they force us to it.They won't risk that. ""Back to CHOAM again," Irulan said."Unless someone has managed to duplicate the sandtrout sandworm cycle on another planet," Idaho said.He looked speculatively at Irulan, excited by this question."Salusa Secundus?""My contacts there remain reliable," Irulan said."Not Salusa. ""Then my answer stands," Alia said, staring at Idaho."We ride with what we have. "My move, Idaho thought.He said: "Why'd you drag me away from important work?You could've worked this out yourself. ""Don't take that tone with me!"Alia snapped.Idaho's eyes went wide.For an instant, he'd seen the alien on Alia's face, and it was a disconcerting sight.He turned his attention to Irulan, but she had not seen   or gave that appearance."I don't need an elementary education," Alia said, her voice still edged with alien anger.Idaho managed a rueful smile, but his breast ached."We never get far from wealth and all of its masks when we deal with power," Irulan drawled."Paul was a social mutation and, as such, we have to remember that he shifted the old balance of wealth. ""Such mutations are not irreversible," Alia said, turning away from them as though she'd not exposed her terrible difference."Wherever there's wealth in this empire, they know this. ""They also know," Irulan said, "that there are three people who could perpetuate that mutation: the twins and... "She pointed at Alia.Are they insane, this pair?Idaho wondered."They will try to assassinate me!"Alia rasped.And Idaho sat in shocked silence, his mentat awareness whirling.Assassinate Alia?Why?They could discredit her too easily.They could cut her out of the Fremen pack and hunt her down at will.But the twins, now...He knew he was not in the proper mentat calm for such an assessment, but he had to try.He had to be as precise as possible.At the same time, he knew that precise thinking contained undigested absolutes.Nature was not precise.The universe was not precise when reduced to his scale; it was vague and fuzzy, full of unexpected movements and changes.Humankind as a whole had to be entered into this computation as a natural phenomenon.And the whole process of precise analysis represented a chopping off, a remove from the ongoing current of the universe.He had to get at that current, see it in motion."We were right to focus on CHOAM and the Landsraad," Irulan drawled."And Duncan's suggestion offers a first line of inquiry for  "  "Money as a translation of energy can't be separated from the energy it expresses," Alia said."We all know this.But we have to answer three specific questions: When?Using what weapons?Where?"The twins...the twins, Idaho thought.It's the twins who're in danger, not Alia."You're not interested in who or how?"Irulan asked."If House Corrino or CHOAM or any other group employs human instruments on this planet," Alia said, "we stand a better than sixty percent chance of finding them before they act.Knowing when they'll act and where gives us a bigger leverage on those odds.How?That's just asking what weapons?"Why can't they see it as I see it?Idaho wondered."All right," Irulan said."When?""When attention is focused on someone else," Alia said."Attention was focused on your mother at the Convocation," Irulan said."There was no attempt. ""Wrong place," Alia said.What is she doing?Idaho wondered."Where, then?"Irulan asked."Right here in the Keep," Alia said."It's the place where I'd feel most secure and least on my guard. ""What weapons?"Irulan asked."Conventional   something a Fremen might have on his person: poisoned crysknife, maula pistol, a  "  "They've not tried a hunter seeker in a long while," Irulan said."Wouldn't work in a crowd," Alia said."There'll have to be a crowd. ""Biological weapon?"Irulan asked."An infectious agent?"Alia asked, not masking her incredulity.How could Irulan think an infectious agent would succeed against the immunological barriers which protected an Atreides?"I was thinking more in the line of some animal," Irulan said."A small pet, say, trained to bite a specific victim, inflicting a poison with its bite. ""The House ferrets will prevent that," Alia said."One of them, then?"Irulan asked."Couldn't be done.The House ferrets would reject an outsider, kill it.You know that. ""I was just exploring possibilities in the hope that  "  "I'll alert my guards," Alia said.As Alia said guards, Idaho put a hand over his Tleilaxu eyes, trying to prevent the demanding involvement which swept over him.It was Rhajia, the movement of Infinity as expressed by Life, the latent cup of total immersion in mentat awareness which lay in wait for every mentat.It threw his awareness onto the universe like a net, falling, defining the shapes within it.He saw the twins crouching in darkness while giant claws raked the air about them."No," he whispered."What?"Alia looked at him as though surprised to find him still there.He took his hand from his eyes."The garments that House Corrino sent?"he asked."Have they been sent on to the twins?""Of course," Irulan said."They're perfectly safe. ""No one's going to try for the twins at Sietch Tabr," Alia said."Not with all of those Stilgar trained guards around. "Idaho stared at her.He had no particular datum to reinforce an argument based on mentat computation, but he knew.He knew.This thing he'd experienced came very close to the visionary power which Paul had known.Neither Irulan nor Alia would believe it, coming from him."I'd like to alert the port authorities against allowing the importation of any outside animals," he said."You're not taking Irulan's suggestion seriously," Alia protested."Why take any chances?"he asked."Tell that to the smugglers," Alia said."I'll put my dependence on the House ferrets. "Idaho shook his head.What could House ferrets do against claws the size of those he envisioned?But Alia was right.Bribes in the right places, one acquiescent Guild navigator, and anyplace in the Empty Quarter became a landing port.The Guild would resist a front position in any attack on House Atreides, but if the price were high enough...Well, the Guild could only be thought of as something like a geological barrier which made attacks difficult, but not impossible.They could always protest that they were just "a transportation agency. "How could they know to what use a particular cargo would be put?Alia broke the silence with a purely Fremen gesture, a raised fist with thumb horizontal.She accompanied the gesture with a traditional expletive which meant, "I give Typhoon Conflict. "She obviously saw herself as the only logical target for assassins, and the gesture protested a universe full of undigested threats.She was saying she would hurl the death wind at anyone who attacked her.Idaho felt the hopelessness of any protest.He saw that she no longer suspected him.He was going back to Tabr and she expected a perfectly executed abduction of the Lady Jessica.He lifted himself from the divan in an adrenaline surge of anger, thinking: If only Alia were the target!If only assassins could get to her!For an instant, he rested his hand on his own knife, but it was not in him to do this.Far better, though, that she die a martyr than live to be discredited and bounded into a sandy grave."Yes," Alia said, misinterpreting his expression as concern for her."You'd best hurry back to Tabr. "And she thought: How foolish of me to suspect Duncan!He's mine, not Jessica's!It had been the demand from the tribes that'd upset her, Alia thought.She waved an airy goodbye to Idaho as he left.Idaho left the Council Chamber feeling hopeless.Not only was Alia blind with her alien possession, but she became more insane with each crisis.She'd already passed her danger point and was doomed.But what could be done for the twins?Whom could he convince?Stilgar?And what could Stilgar do that he wasn't already doing?The Lady Jessica, then?Yes, he'd explore that possibility   but she, too, might be far gone in plotting with her Sisterhood.He carried few illusions about that Atreides concubine.She might do anything at the command of the Bene Gesserits   even turn against her own grandchildren.= = = = = =   Good government never depends upon laws, but upon the personal qualities of those who govern.The machinery of government is always subordinate to the will of those who administer that machinery.The most important element of government, therefore, is the method of choosing leaders.Law and Governance, The Spacing Guild Manual   Why does Alia wish me to share the morning audience?Jessica wondered.They've not voted me back into the Council.Jessica stood in the anteroom to the Keep's Great Hall.The anteroom itself would have been a great hall anywhere other than Arrakis.Following the Atreides lead, buildings in Arrakeen had become ever more gigantic as wealth and power concentrated, and this room epitomized her misgivings.She did not like this anteroom with its tiled floor depicting her son's victory over Shaddam IV.She caught a reflection of her own face in the polished plasteel door which led into the Great Hall.Returning to Dune forced such comparisons upon her, and Jessica noted only the signs of aging in her own features: the oval face had developed tiny lines and the eyes were more brittle in their indigo reflection.She could remember when there had been white around the blue of her eyes.Only the careful ministrations of a professional dresser maintained the polished bronze of her hair.Her nose remained small, mouth generous, and her body was still slender, but even the Bene Gesserit trained muscles had a tendency toward slowing with the passage of time.Some might not note this and say: "You haven't changed a bit!"But the Sisterhood's training was a two edged sword; small changes seldom escaped the notice of people thus trained.And the lack of small changes in Alia had not escaped Jessica's notice.Javid, the master of Alia's appointments, stood at the great door, being very official this morning.He was a robed genie with a cynical smile on his round face.Javid struck Jessica as a paradox: a well fed Fremen.Noting her attention upon him, Javid smiled knowingly, shrugged.His attendance in Jessica's entourage had been short, as he'd known it would be.He hated Atreides, but he was Alia's man in more ways than one, if the rumors were to be believed,  Jessica saw the shrug, thought: This is the age of the shrug.He knows I've heard all the stories about him and he doesn't care.Our civilization could well die of indifference within it before succumbing to external attack.The guards Gurney had assigned her before leaving for the smugglers and the desert hadn't liked her coming here without their attendance.But Jessica felt oddly safe.Let someone make a martyr of her in this place; Alia wouldn't survive it.Alia would know that.When Jessica failed to respond to his shrug and smile, Javid coughed, a belching disturbance of his larynx which could only have been achieved with practice.It was like a secret language.It said: "We understand the nonsense of all this pomp, My Lady.Isn't it wonderful what humans can be made to believe!"Wonderful!Jessica agreed, but her face gave no indication of the thought.The anteroom was quite full now, all of the morning's permitted supplicants having received their right of entrance from Javid's people.The outer doors had been closed.Supplicants and attendants kept a polite distance from Jessica, but observed that she wore the formal black aba of a Fremen Reverend Mother.This would raise many questions.No mark of Muad'Dib's priesthood could be seen on her person.Conversations hummed as the people divided their attention between Jessica and the small side door through which Alia would come to lead them into the Great Hall.It was obvious to Jessica that the old pattern which defined where the Regency's powers lay had been shaken.I did that just by coming here, she thought.But I came because Alia invited me.Reading the signs of disturbance, Jessica realized Alia was deliberately prolonging this moment, allowing the subtle currents to run their course here.Alia would be watching from a spy hole, of course.Few subtleties of Alia's behavior escaped Jessica, and she felt with each passing minute how right she'd been to accept the mission which the Sisterhood had pressed upon her."Matters cannot be allowed to continue in this way," the leader of the Bene Gesserit delegation had argued."Surely the signs of decay have not escaped you   you of all people!We know why you left us, but we know also how you were trained.Nothing was stinted in your education.You are an adept of the Panoplia Prophetica and you must know when the souring of a powerful religion threatens us all. "Jessica had pursed her lips in thought while staring out a window at the soft signs of spring at Castle Caladan.She did not like to direct her thinking in such a logical fashion.One of the first lessons of the Sisterhood had been to reserve an attitude of questioning distrust for anything which came in the guise of logic.But the members of the delegation had known that, too.How moist the air had been that morning, Jessica thought, looking around Alia's anteroom.How fresh and moist.Here there was a sweaty dampness to the air which evoked a sense of uneasiness in Jessica, and she thought: I've reverted to Fremen ways.The air was too moist in this sietch above ground.What was wrong with the Master of the Stills?Paul would never have permitted such laxness.She noted that Javid, his shiny face alert and composed, appeared not to have noticed the fault of dampness in the anteroom's air.Bad training for one born on Arrakis.The members of the Bene Gesserit delegation had wanted to know if she required proofs of their allegations.She'd given them an angry answer out of their own manuals: "All proofs inevitably lead to propositions which have no proof!All things are known because we want to believe in them. ""But we have submitted these questions to mentats," the delegation's leader had protested.Jessica had stared at the woman, astonished."I marvel that you have reached your present station and not yet learned the limits of mentats," Jessica had said.At which the delegation had relaxed.Apparently it had all been a test, and she had passed.They'd feared, of course, that she had lost all touch with those balancing abilities which were at the core of Bene Gesserit training.Now Jessica became softly alert as Javid left his door station and approached her.He bowed."My Lady.It occurred to me that you might not've heard the latest exploit of The Preacher. ""I get daily reports on everything which occurs here," Jessica said.Let him take that back to Alia!Javid smiled."Then you know he rails against your family.Only last night, he preached in the south suburb and no one dared touch him.You know why, of course. ""Because they think he's my son come back to them," Jessica said, her voice bored."This question has not yet been put to the mentat Idaho," Javid said."Perhaps that should be done and the thing settled. "Jessica thought: Here's one who truly doesn't know a mentat's limits, although he dares put horns on one   in his dreams if not in fact."Mentats share the fallibilities of those who use them," she said."The human mind, as is the case with the mind of any animal, is a resonator.It responds to resonances in the environment.The mentat has learned to extend his awareness across many parallel loops of causality and to proceed along those loops for long chains of consequences. "Let him chew on that!"This Preacher doesn't disturb you, then?"Javid asked, his voice abruptly formal and portentous."I find him a healthy sign," she said."I don't want him bothered. "Javid clearly had not expected that blunt a response.He tried to smile, failed.Then: "The ruling Council of the church which deifies thy son will, of course, bow to your wishes if you insist.But certainly some explanation  "  "Perhaps you'd rather I explained how I fit into your schemes," she said.Javid stared at her narrowly."Madame, I see no logical reason why thou refusest to denounce this Preacher.He cannot be thy son.I make a reasonable request: denounce him. "This is a set piece, Jessica thought.Alia put him up to it.She said: "No. ""But he defiles the name of thy son!He preaches abominable things, cries out against thy holy daughter.He incites the populace against us.When asked, he said that even thou possessest the nature of evil and that thy  "  "Enough of this nonsense!"Jessica said."Tell Alia that I refuse.I've heard nothing but tales of this Preacher since returning.He bores me. ""Does it bore thee, Madame, to learn that in his latest defilement he has said that thou wilt not turn against him?And here, clearly, thou  "  "Evil as I am, I still won't denounce him," she said."It is no joking matter, Madame!"Jessica waved him away angrily."Begone!"She spoke with sufficient carrying power that others heard, forcing him to obey.His eyes glared with rage, but he managed a stiff bow and returned to his position at the door.This argument fitted neatly into the observations Jessica already had made.When he spoke of Alia, Javid's voice carried the husky undertones of a lover; no mistaking it.The rumors no doubt were true.Alia had allowed her life to degenerate in a terrible way.Observing this, Jessica began to harbor the suspicion that Alia was a willing participant in Abomination.Was it a perverse will to self destruction?Because surely Alia was working to destroy herself and the power base which fed on her brother's teachings.Faint stirrings of unease began to grow apparent in the anteroom.The aficionados of this place would know when Alia delayed too long, and by now they'd all heard about Jessica's peremptory dismissal of Alia's favorite.Jessica sighed.She felt that her body had walked into this place with her soul creeping behind.Movements among the courtiers were so transparent!The seeking out of important people was a dance like the wind through a field of cereal stalks.The cultivated inhabitants of this place furrowed their brows and gave pragmatic rating numbers to the importance of each of their fellows.Obviously her rebuff of Javid had hurt him; few spoke to him now.But the others!Her trained eye could read the rating numbers in the satellites attending the powerful.They do not attend me because I am dangerous, she thought.I have the stink of someone Alia fears.Jessica glanced around the room, seeing eyes turn away.They were such seriously futile people that she found herself wanting to cry out against their ready made justifications for pointless lives.Oh, if only The Preacher could see this room as it looked now!A fragment of a nearby conversation caught her attention.A tall, slender Priest was addressing his coterie, no doubt supplicants here under his auspices."Often I must speak otherwise than I think," he said."This is called diplomacy. "The resultant laughter was too loud, too quickly silenced.People in the group saw that Jessica had overheard.My Duke would have transported such a one to the farthest available hellhole!Jessica thought.I've returned none too soon.She knew now that she'd lived on faraway Caladan in an insulated capsule which had allowed only the most blatant of Alia's excesses to intrude.I contributed to my own dream existence, she thought.Caladan had been something like that insulation provided by a really first class frigate riding securely in the hold of a Guild heighliner.Only the most violent maneuvers could be felt, and those as mere softened movements.How seductive it is to live in peace, she thought.The more she saw of Alia's court, the more sympathy Jessica felt for the words reported as coming from this blind Preacher.Yes, Paul might have said such words on seeing what had become of his realm.And Jessica wondered what Gurney had found out among the smugglers.Her first reaction to Arrakeen had been the right one, Jessica realized.On that first ride into the city with Javid, her attention had been caught by armored screens around dwellings, the heavily guarded pathways and alleys, the patient watchers at every turn, the tall walls and indications of deep underground places revealed by thick foundations.Arrakeen had become an ungenerous place, a contained place, unreasonable and self righteous in its harsh outlines.Abruptly the anteroom's small side door opened.A vanguard of priestess amazons spewed into the room with Alia shielded behind them, haughty and moving with a confined awareness of real and terrible power.Alia's face was composed; no emotion betrayed itself as her gaze caught and held her mother's.But both knew the battle had been joined.At Javid's command, the giant doors into the great Hall were opened, moving with a silent and inevitable sense of hidden energies.Alia came to her mother's side as the guards enfolded them."Shall we go in now, mother?"Alia asked."It's high time," Jessica said.And she thought, seeing the sense of gloating in Alia's eyes: She thinks she can destroy me and remain unscathed!She's mad!And Jessica wondered if that might not have been what Idaho had wanted.He'd sent a message, but she'd been unable to respond.Such an enigmatic message: "Danger.Must see you. "It had been written in a variant of the old Chakobsa where the particular word chosen to denote danger signified a plot.I'll see him immediately when I return to Tabr, she thought.= = = = = =   This is the fallacy of power: ultimately it is effective only in an absolute, a limited universe.But the basic lesson of our relativistic universe is that things change.Any power must always meet a greater power.Paul Muad'Dib taught this lesson to the Sardaukar on the Plains of Arrakeen.His descendants have yet to learn the lesson for themselves.The Preacher at Arrakeen   The first supplicant for the morning audience was a Kadeshian troubadour, a pilgrim of the Hajj whose purse had been emptied by Arrakeen mercenaries.He stood on the water green stone of the chamber floor with no air of begging about him.Jessica admired his boldness from where she sat with Alia atop the seven step platform.Identical thrones had been placed here for mother and daughter, and Jessica made particular note of the fact that Alia sat on the right, the masculine position.As for the Kadeshian troubadour, it was obvious that Javid's people had passed him for just this quality he now displayed, his boldness.The troubadour was expected to provide some entertainment for the courtiers of the Great Hall; it was the payment he'd make in lieu of the money he no longer possessed.From the report of the Priest Advocate who now pled the troubadour's case, the Kadeshian had retained only the clothing on his back and the baliset slung over one shoulder on a leather cord."He says he was fed a dark drink," the Advocate said, barely hiding the smile which sought to twist his lips."If it please your Holiness, the drink left him helpless but awake while his purse was cut,"  Jessica studied the troubadour while the Advocate droned on and on with a false subservience, his voice full of mucky morals.The Kadeshian was tall, easily two meters.He had a roving eye which showed intelligent alertness and humor.His golden hair was worn to the shoulders in the style of his planet, and there was a sense of virile strength in the broad chest and neatly tapering body which a grey Hajj robe could not conceal.His name was given as Tagir Mohandis and he was descended from merchant engineers, proud of his ancestry and himself.Alia finally cut off the pleading with a hand wave, spoke without turning: "The Lady Jessica will render first judgment in honor of her return to us. ""Thank you, daughter," Jessica said, staling the order of ascendancy to all who heard.Daughter!So this Tagir Mohandis was part of their plan.Or was he an innocent dupe?This judgment was designed to open attack on herself, Jessica realized.It was obvious in Alia's attitude."Do you play that instrument well?"Jessica asked, indicating the nine string baliset on the troubadour's shoulder."As well as the Great Gurney Halleck himself!"Tagir Mohandis spoke loudly for all in the hall to hear, and his words evoked an interested stir among the courtiers."You seek the gift of transport money," Jessica said."Where would that money take you?""To Salusa Secundus and Farad'n's court," Mohandis said."I've heard he seeks troubadours and minstrels, that he supports the arts and builds a great renaissance of cultivated life around him. "Jessica refrained from glancing at Alia.They'd known, of course, what Mohandis would ask.She found herself enjoying this byplay.Did they think her unable to meet this thrust?"Will you play for your passage?"Jessica asked."My terms are Fremen terms.If I enjoy your music, I may keep you here to smooth away my cares; if your music offends me, I may send you to toil in the desert for your passage money.If I deem your playing just right for Farad'n, who is said to be an enemy of the Atreides, then I will send you to him with my blessing.Will you play on these terms, Tagir Mohandis?"He threw his head back in a great roaring laugh.His blond hair danced as he unslung the baliset and tuned it deftly to indicate acceptance of her challenge.The crowd in the chamber started to press closer, but were held back by courtiers and guards.Presently Mohandis strummed a note, holding the bass hum of the side strings with a fine attention to their compelling vibration.Then, lifting his voice in a mellow tenor, he sang, obviously improvising, but his touch so deft that Jessica was enthralled before she focused on his lyrics:  		"You say you long for Caladan seas, 		Where once you ruled, Atreides, 		Without surcease   		But exiles dwell in stranger lands!You say 'twere bitter, men so rude, 		To sell your dreams of Shai Hulud, 		For tasteless food   		And exiles, dwell in stranger lands.You make Arrakis grow infirm, 		Silence the passage of the worm 		And end your term   		As exiles, dwell in stranger lands.Alia!They name you Coan Teen, 		That spirit who is never seen 		Until  "  "Enough!"Alia screamed.She pushed herself half out of her throne."I'll have you  "  "Alia!"Jessica spoke just loud enough, voice pitched just right to avoid confrontation while gaining full attention.It was a masterful use of Voice and all who heard it recognized the trained powers in this demonstration.Alia sank back into her seat and Jessica noted that she showed not the slightest discomfiture.This, too, was anticipated, Jessica thought.How very interesting."The judgment on this first one is mine," Jessica reminded her."Very well. "Alia's words were barely audible."I find this one a fitting gift for Farad'n," Jessica said."He has a tongue which cuts like a crysknife.Such bloodletting as that tongue can administer would be healthy for our own court, but I'd rather he ministered to House Corrino. "A light rippling of laughter spread through the hall.Alia permitted herself a snorting exhalation."Do you know what he called me?""He didn't call you anything, daughter.He but reported that which he or anyone else could hear in the streets.There they call you Coan Teen... ""The female death spirit who walks without feet," Alia snarled."If you put away those who report accurately, you'll keep only those who know what you want to hear," Jessica said, her voice sweet."I can think of nothing more poisonous than to rot in the stink of your own reflections. "Audible gasps came from those immediately below the thrones.Jessica focused on Mohandis, who remained silent, standing completely uncowed.He awaited whatever judgment was passed upon him as though it did not matter.Mohandis was exactly the kind of man her Duke would have chosen to have by his side in troubled times: one who acted with confidence of his own judgment, but accepted whatever befell, even death, without berating his fate.Then why had he chosen this course?"Why did you sing those particular words?"Jessica asked him.He lifted his head to speak clearly: "I'd heard that the Atreides were honorable and open minded.I'd a thought to test it and perhaps to stay here in your service, thereby having the time to seek out those who robbed me and deal with them in my own fashion. ""He dares test us!"Alia muttered."Why not?"Jessica asked.She smiled down at the troubadour to signal goodwill.He had come into this hall only because it offered him opportunity for another adventure, another passage through his universe.Jessica found herself tempted to bind him to her own entourage, but Alia's reaction boded evil for brave Mohandis.There were also those signs which said this was the course expected of the Lady Jessica   take a brave and handsome troubadour into her service as she'd taken brave Gurney Halleck.Best Mohandis were sent on his way, though it rankled to lose such a fine specimen to Farad'n."He shall go to Farad'n," Jessica said."See that he gets his passage money.Let his tongue draw the blood of House Corrino and see how he survives it. "Alia glowered at the floor, then produced a belated smile."The wisdom of the Lady Jessica prevails," she said, waving Mohandis away.That did not go the way she wanted, Jessica thought, but there were indicators in Alia's manner that a more potent test remained.Another supplicant was being brought forward.Jessica, noting her daughter's reaction, felt the gnawing of doubts.The lesson learned from the twins was needed here.Let Alia be Abomination, still she was one of the preborn.She could know her mother as she knew herself.It did not compute that Alia would misjudge her mother's reactions in the matter of the troubadour.Why did Alia stage that confrontation?To distract me?There was no more time to reflect.The second supplicant had taken his place below the twin thrones, his Advocate at his side.The supplicant was a Fremen this time, an old man with the sand marks of the desert born on his face.He was not tall, but had a wiry body and the long dishdasha usually worn over a stillsuit gave him a stately appearance.The robe was in keeping with his narrow face and beaked nose, the glaring eyes of blue on blue.He wore no stillsuit and seemed uncomfortable without it.The gigantic space of the Audience Hall must seem to him like the dangerous open air which robbed his flesh of its priceless moisture.Under the hood, which had been thrown partly back, he wore the knotted keffiya headdress of a Naib."I am Ghadhean al Fali," he said, placing one foot on the steps to the thrones to signify his status above that of the mob."I was one of Muad'Dib's death commandos and I am here concerning a matter of the desert. "Alia stiffened only slightly, a small betrayal.Al Fali's name had been on that demand to place Jessica on the Council.A matter of the desert!Jessica thought.Ghadhean al Fali had spoken before his Advocate could open the pleading.With that formal Fremen phrase he had placed them on notice that he brought them something of concern to all of Dune   and that he spoke with the authority of a Fedaykin who had offered his life beside that of Paul Muad'Dib.Jessica doubted that this was what Ghadhean al Fali had told Javid or the Advocate General in seeking audience here.Her guess was confirmed as an official of the Priesthood rushed forward from the rear of the chamber waving the black cloth of intercession."My Ladies!"the official called out."Do not listen to this man!He comes under false  "  Jessica, watching the Priest run toward them, caught a movement out of the corners of her eyes, saw Alia's hand signaling in the old Atreides battle language: "Now!"Jessica could not determine where the signal was directed, but acted instinctively with a lurch to the left, taking throne and all.She rolled away from the crashing throne as she fell, came to her feet as she heard the sharp spat of a maula pistol...and again.But she was moving with the first sound, felt something tug at her right sleeve.She dove into the throng of supplicants and courtiers gathered below the dais.Alia, she noted, had not moved.Surrounded by people, Jessica stopped.Ghadhean al Fali, she saw, had dodged to the other side of the dais, but the Advocate remained in his original position.It had all happened with the rapidity of an ambush, but everyone in the Hall knew where trained reflexes should have taken anyone caught by surprise.Alia and the Advocate stood frozen in their exposure.A disturbance toward the middle of the room caught Jessica's attention and she forced a way through the throng, saw four supplicants holding the Priest official.His black cloth of intercession lay near his feet, a maula pistol exposed in its folds.Al Fali thrust his way past Jessica, looked from the pistol to the Priest.The Fremen let out a cry of rage, came up from his belt with an achag blow, the fingers of his left hand rigid.They caught the Priest in the throat and he collapsed, strangling.Without a backward glance at the man he had killed, the old Naib turned an angry face toward the dais."Dalal il 'an nubuwwa!"al Fali called, placing both palms against his forehead, then lowering them."The Qadis as Salaf will not let me be silenced!If I do not slay those who interfere, others will slay them!"He thinks he was the target, Jessica realized.She looked down at her sleeve, put a finger in the neat hole left by the maula pellet.Poisoned, no doubt.The supplicants had dropped the Priest.He lay writhing on the floor, dying with his larynx crushed.Jessica motioned to a pair of shocked courtiers standing at her left, said: "I want that man saved for questioning.If he dies, you die!"As they hesitated, peering toward the dais, she used Voice on them: "Move!"The pair moved.Jessica thrust herself to al Fali's side, nudged him: "You are a fool, Naib!They were after me, not you. "Several people around them heard her.In the immediate shocked silence, al Fali glanced at the dais with its one toppled throne and Alia still seated on the other.The look of realization which came over his face could've been read by a novice."Fedaykin," Jessica said, reminding him of his old service to her family, "we who have been scorched know how to stand back to back. ""Trust me, My Lady," he said, taking her meaning immediately.A gasp behind Jessica brought her whirling, and she felt al Fali move to stand with his back to her.A woman in the gaudy garb of a city Fremen was straightening from beside the Priest on the floor.The two courtiers were nowhere to be seen.The woman did not even glance at Jessica, but lifted her voice in the ancient keening of her people   the call for those who serviced the deathstills, the call for them to come and gather a body's water into the tribal cistern.It was a curiously incongruous noise coming from one dressed as this woman was.Jessica felt the persistence of the old ways even as she saw the falseness in this city woman.The creature in the gaudy dress obviously had killed the Priest to make sure he was silenced.Why did she bother?Jessica wondered.She had only to wait for the man to die of asphyxiation.The act was a desperate one, a sign of deep fear.Alia sat forward on the edge of her throne, her eyes aglitter with watchfulness.A slender woman wearing the braid knots of Alia's own guards strode past Jessica, bent over the Priest, straightened, and looked back at the dais."He is dead. ""Have him removed," Alia called.She motioned to guards below the dais."Straighten the Lady Jessica's chair. "So you'll try to brazen it out!Jessica thought.Did Alia think anyone had been fooled?Al Fali had spoken of the Qadis as Salaf, calling on the holy fathers of Fremen mythology as his protectors.But no supernatural agency had brought a maula pistol into this room where no weapons were permitted.A conspiracy involving Javid's people was the only answer, and Alia's unconcern about her own person told everyone she was a part of that conspiracy.The old Naib spoke over his shoulder to Jessica: "Accept my apologies, My Lady.We of the desert come to you as our last desperate hope, and now we see that you still have need of us. ""Matricide does not sit well on my daughter," Jessica said."The tribes will hear of this," al Fali promised."If you have such desperate need of me," Jessica asked, "why did you not approach me at the Convocation in Sietch Tabr?""Stilgar would not permit it. "Ahhh, Jessica thought, the rule of the Naibs!In Tabr, Stilgar's word was law.The toppled throne had been straightened.Alia motioned for her mother to return, said: "All of you please note the death of that traitor Priest.Those who threaten me die. "She glanced at al Fali."My thanks to you, Naib. ""Thanks for a mistake," al Fali muttered.He looked at Jessica."You were right.My rage removed one who should've been questioned. "Jessica whispered: "Mark those two courtiers and the woman in the colorful dress, Fedaykin.I want them taken and questioned. ""It will be done," he said."If we get out of here alive," Jessica said."Come, let us go back and play our parts. ""As you say, My Lady. "Together, they returned to the dais, Jessica mounting the steps and resuming her position beside Alia, al Fali remaining in the supplicant's position below."Now," Alia said."One moment, daughter," Jessica said.She held up her sleeve, exposed the hole with a finger through it."The attack was aimed at me.The pellet almost found me even as I was dodging.You will all note that the maula pistol is no longer down there. "She pointed."Who has it?"There was no response."Perhaps it could be traced," Jessica said."What nonsense!"Alia said."I was the  "  Jessica half turned toward her daughter, motioned with her left hand."Someone down there has that pistol.Don't you have a fear that  "  "One of my guards has it!"Alia said."Then that guard will bring the weapon to me," Jessica said."She's already taken it away. ""How convenient," Jessica said."What are you saying?"Alia demanded.Jessica allowed herself a grim smile."I am saying that two of your people were charged with saving that traitor Priest.I warned them that they would die if he died.They will die. ""I forbid it!"Jessica merely shrugged."We have a brave Fedaykin here," Alia said, motioning toward al Fali."This argument can wait. ""It can wait forever," Jessica said, speaking in Chakobsa, her words double barbed to tell Alia that no argument would stop the death command."We shall see!"Alia said.She turned to al Fali."Why are you here, Ghadhean al Fali?""To see the mother of Muad'Dib," the Naib said."What is left of the Fedaykin, that band of brothers who served her son, pooled their poor resources to buy my way in here past the avaricious guardians who shield the Atreides from the realities of Arrakis. "Alia said: "Anything the Fedaykin require, they have only  "  "He came to see me," Jessica interrupted."What is your desperate need, Fedaykin?"Alia said: "I speak for the Atreides here!What is  "  "Be silent, you murderous Abomination!"Jessica snapped."You tried to have me killed, daughter!I say it for all here to know.You can't have everyone in this hall killed to silence them   as that Priest was silenced.Yes, the Naib's blow would've killed the man, but he could've been saved.He could've been questioned!You have no concern that he was silenced.Spray your protests upon us as you will, your guilt is written in your actions!"Alia sat in frozen silence, face pale.And Jessica, watching the play of emotions across her daughter's face, saw a terrifyingly familiar movement of Alia's hands, an unconscious response which once had identified a deadly enemy of the Atreides.Alia's fingers moved in a tapping rhythm   little finger twice, index finger three times, ring finger twice, little finger once, ring finger twice...and back through the tapping in the same order.The old Baron!The focus of Jessica's eyes caught Alia's attention and she glanced down at her hand, held it still, looked back at her mother to see the terrible recognition.A gloating smile locked Alia's mouth."So you have your revenge upon us," Jessica whispered."Have you gone mad, mother?"Alia asked."I wish I had," Jessica said.And she thought: She knows I will confirm this to the Sisterhood.She knows.She may even suspect I'll tell the Fremen and force her into a Trial of Possession.She cannot let me leave here alive."Our brave Fedaykin waits while we argue," Alia said.Jessica forced her attention back to the old Naib.She brought her responses under control, said: "You came to see me, Ghadhean. ""Yes, My Lady.We of the desert see terrible things happening.The Little Makers come out of the sand as was foretold in the oldest prophecies.Shai Hulud no longer can be found except in the deeps of the Empty Quarter.We have abandoned our friend, the desert!"Jessica glanced at Alia, who merely motioned for Jessica to continue.Jessica looked out over the throng in the Chamber, saw the shocked alertness on every face.
