No siree, you're going to move to a spare workstation and get to work on that.And you don't have that flexibility if you've got half a ton of personal stuff cached inside of a desk, strewn around a desktop.So there is no paper in a Fed office.All the workstations are the same.You come in in the morning, pick one at random, sit down, and get to work.You could try to favor a particular station, try to sit there every day, but it would be noticed.Generally you pick the unoccupied workstation that's closest to the door.That way, whoever came in earliest sits closest, whoever came in latest is way in the back, for the rest of the day it's obvious at a glance who's on the ball in this office and who isas they whisper to each other in the bathroomshaving problems.Not that it's any big secret, who comes in first.When you sign on to a workstation in the morning, it's not like the central computer doesn't notice that fact.The central computer notices just about everything.Keeps track of every key you hit on the keyboard, all day long, what time you hit it, down to the microsecond, whether it was the right key or the wrong key, how many mistakes you make and when you make them.You're only required to be at your workstation from eight to five, with a half hour lunch break and two ten minute coffee breaks, but if you stuck to that schedule it would definitely be noticed, which is why Y. T.'s mom is sliding into the first unoccupied workstation and signing on to her machine at quarter to seven.Half a dozen other people are already here, signed on to workstations closer to the entrance, but this isn't bad.She can look forward to a reasonably stable career if she can keep up this sort of performance.The Feds still operate in Flatland.None of this three dimensional stuff, no goggles, no stereo sound.The computers are all basic flat screen two dimensional numbers.Windows appear on the desktop, with little text documents inside.All part of the austerity program.Soon to reap major benefits.She signs on and checks her mail.No personal mail, just a couple of mass distributed pronouncements from Marietta.NEW TP POOL REGULATIONS  I've been asked to distribute the new regulations regarding office pool displays.The enclosed memo is a new subchapter of the EBGOC Procedure Manual, replacing the old subchapter entitled PHYSICAL PLANT/CALIFORNIA/LOS ANGELES/BUILDINGS/OFFICE AREAS/PHYSICAL LAYOUT REGULATIONS/EMPLOYEE INPUT/GROUP ACTIVITIES.The old subchapter was a flat prohibition on the use of office space or time for pool activities of any kind, whether permanent (e. g. , coffee pool) or one time (e. g. , birthday parties).This prohibition still applies, but a single, onetime exception has now been made for any office that wishes to pursue a joint bathroom tissue strategy.By way of introduction, let me just make a few general comments on this subject.The problem of distributing bathroom tissue to workers presents inherent challenges for any office management system due to the inherent unpredictability of usagenot every facility usage transaction necessitates the use of bathroom tissue, and when it is used, the amount needed (number of squares) may vary quite widely from person to person and, for a given person, from one transaction to the next.This does not even take into account the occasional use of bathroom tissue for unpredictable/creative purposes such as applying/removing cosmetics, beveragespill management, etc.For this reason, rather than trying to package bathroom tissue in small one transaction packets (as is done with premoistened towelettes, for example), which can be wasteful in some cases and limiting in other cases, it has been traditional to package this product in bulk distribution units whose size exceeds the maximum amount of squares that an individual could conceivably use in a single transaction (barring force majeure).This reduces to a minimum the number of transactions in which the distribution unit is depleted (the roll runs out) during the transaction, a situation that can lead to emotional stress for the affected employee.However, it does present the manager with some challenges in that the distribution unit is rather bulky and must be repeatedly used by a number of different individuals if it is not to be wasted.Since the implementation of Phase XVII of the Austerity Program, employees have been allowed to bring their own bathroom tissue from home.This approach is somewhat bulky and redundant, as every worker usually brings their own roll.Some offices have attempted to meet this challenge by instituting bathroom tissue pools.Without overgeneralizing, it may be stated that an inherent and irreducible feature of any bathroom tissue pool implemented at the office level, in an environment (i. e. , building) in which comfort stations are distributed on a per floor basis (i. e. , in which several offices share a single facility) is that provision must be made within the confines of the individual office for temporary stationing of bathroom tissue distribution units (i. e. , rolls).This follows from the fact that if the BTDUs (rolls) are stationed, while inactive, outside of the purview of the controlling office (i. e. , the office that has collectively purchased the BTDU)that is, if the BTDUs are stored, for example, in a lobby area or within the facility in which they are actually utilized, they will be subject to pilferage and shrinkage as unauthorized persons consume them, either as part of a conscious effort to pilfer or out of an honest misunderstanding, i. e. , a belief that the BTDUs are being provided free of charge by the operating agency (in this case the United States Government), or as the result of necessity, as in the case of a beverage spill that is encroaching on sensitive electronic equipment and whose management will thus brook no delay.This fact has led certain offices (which shall go unnamedyou know who you are, guys) to establish makeshift BTDU depots that also serve as pool contribution collection points.Usually, these depots take the form of a table, near the door closest to the facility, on which the BTDUs are stacked or otherwise deployed, with a bowl or some other receptacle in which participants may place their contributions, and typically with a sign or other attention getting device (such as a stuffed animal or cartoon) requesting donations.A quick glance at the current regulations will show that placement of such a display/depot violates the procedure manual.However, in the interests of employee hygiene, morale, and group spirit building, my higher ups have agreed to make a one time exception in the regulations for this purpose.As with any part of the procedure manual, new or old, it is your responsibility to be thoroughly familiar with this material.Estimated reading time for this document is 15.62 minutes (and don't think we won't check).Please make note of the major points made in this document, as follows:    1) BTDU depot/displays are now allowed, on a trial basis, with the new policy to be reviewed in six months.2) These must be operated on a voluntary, pool type basis, as described in the subchapter on employee pools.(Note: This means keeping books and tallying all financial transactions. )3) BTDUs must be brought in by the employees (not shipped through the mailroom) and are subject to all the usual search and seizure regulations.4) Scented BTDUs are prohibited as they may cause allergic reactions, wheezing, etc.in some persons.5) Cash pool donations, as with all monetary transactions within the U. S.  Government, must use official U. S.  currencyno yen or Kongbucks!Naturally, this will lead to a bulk problem if people try to use the donation bucket as a dumping ground for bundles of old billion  and trillion dollar bills.The Buildings and Grounds people are worried about waste disposal problems and the potential fire hazard that may ensue if large piles of billions and trillions begin to mount up.Therefore, a key feature of the new regulation is that the donation bucket must be emptied every daymore often if an excessive build up situation is seen to develop.In this vein, the B & G people would also like me to point out that many of you who have excess U. S.  currency to get rid of have been trying to kill two birds with one stone by using old billions as bathroom tissue.While creative, this approach has two drawbacks:  1) It clogs the plumbing, and  2) It constitutes defacement of U. S.  currency, which is a federal crime.DON'T DO IT.Join your office bathroom tissue pool instead.It's easy, it's hygienic, and it's legal.Happy pooling!Marietta.Y. T.'s mom pulls up the new memo, checks the time, and starts reading it.The estimated reading time is 15.62 minutes.Later, when Marietta does her end of day statistical roundup, sitting in her private office at 9:00 P. M. , she will see the name of each employee and next to it, the amount of time spent reading this memo, and her reaction, based on the time spent, will go something like this:    Less than 10 min.Time for an employee conference and possible attitude counseling.1014 min.Keep an eye on this employee; may be developing slipshod attitude.1415.61 min.Employee is an efficient worker, may sometimes miss important details.Exactly 15.62 min.Smartass.Needs attitude counseling.15.6316 min.Asswipe.Not to be trusted.1618 min.Employee is a methodical worker, may sometimes get hung up on minor details.More than 18 min.Check the security videotape, see just what this employee was up to (e. g. , possible unauthorized restroom break).Y. T.'s mom decides to spend between fourteen and fifteen minutes reading the memo.It's better for younger workers to spend too long, to show that they're careful, not cocky.It's better for older workers to go a little fast, to show good management potential.She's pushing forty.She scans through the memo, hitting the Page Down button at reasonably regular intervals, occasionally paging back up to pretend to reread some earlier section.The computer is going to notice all this.It approves of rereading.It's a small thing, but over a decade or so this stuff really shows up on your work habits summary.Having got that out of the way, she dives into work.She is an applications programmer for the Feds.In the old days, she would have written computer programs for a living.Nowadays, she writes fragments of computer programs.These programs are designed by Marietta and Marietta's superiors in massive week long meetings on the top floor.Once they get the design down, they start breaking up the problem into tinier and tinier segments, assigning them to group managers, who break them down even more and feed little bits of work to the individual programmers.In order to keep the work done by the individual coders from colliding, it all has to be done according to a set of rules and regulations even bigger and more fluid than the Government procedure manual.So the first thing that Y. T.'s mother does, having read the new subchapter on bathroom tissue pools, is to sign on to a subsystem of the main computer system that handles the particular programming project she's working on.She doesn't know what the project isthat's classifiedor what it's called.It's just her project.She shares it with a few hundred other programmers, she's not sure exactly who.And every day when she signs on to it, there's a stack of memos waiting for her, containing new regulations and changes to the rules that they all have to follow when writing code for the project.These regulations make the business with the bathroom tissue seem as simple and elegant as the Ten Commandments.So she spends until about eleven A. M.  reading, re reading, and understanding the new changes in the Project.There are many of these, because this is a Monday morning and Marietta and her higher ups spent the whole weekend closeted on the top floor, having a catfight about this Project, changing everything.Then she starts going back over all the code she has previously written for the Project and making a list of all the stuff that will have to be rewritten in order to make it compatible with the new specifications.Basically, she's going to have to rewrite all of her material from the ground up.For the third time in as many months.But hey, it's a job.About eleven thirty, she looks up, startled, to see that half a dozen people are standing around her workstation.There's Marietta.And a proctor.And some male Feds.And Leon the polygraph man.I just had mine on Thursday, she says.Time for another one, Marietta says.Come on, let's get this show on the road.Hands out where I can see them, the proctor says.38  Y. T.'s mom stands up, hands to her sides, and starts walking.She walks straight out of the office.None of the other people look up.Not supposed to.Insensitive to co workers' needs.Makes the testee feel awkward and singled out, when in fact the polygraph is just part of the whole Fed way of life.She can hear the snapping footsteps of the proctor behind her, walking two paces behind, watching, keeping her eyes on those hands so they can't be doing anything, like popping a Valium or something else that might throw off the test.She stops in front of the bathroom door.The proctor walks in front of her, holds it open, and she walks in, followed by the proctor.The last stall on the left is oversized, big enough for two people.Y. T.'s mom goes in, followed by the proctor, who closes and locks the door.Y. T.'s mom pulls down her panty hose, pulls up her skirt, squats over a pan, pees.The proctor watches every drop go into the pan, picks it up, empties it into a test tube that is already labeled with her name and today's date.Then it's back out to the lobby, followed again by the proctor.You're allowed to use the elevators on your way to the polygraph room, so you won't be out of breath and sweaty when you get there.It used to be just a plain office with a chair and some instruments on a table.Then they got the new, fancy polygraph system.Now it's like going in for some kind of high tech medical scan.The room is completely rebuilt, no vestige of its original function, the window covered over, everything smooth and beige and smelling like a hospital.There's only one chair, in the middle.Y. T.'s mom goes and sits down in it, puts her arms on the arms of the chair, nestles her fingertips and palms into the little depressions that await.The neoprene fist of the blood pressure cuff gropes blindly, finds her arm, and seizes it.Meanwhile, the room lights are dimming, the door is closing, she's all alone.The crown of thorns closes over her head, she feels the pricks of the electrodes through her scalp, senses the cool air flowing down over her shoulders from the superconducting quantum interference devices that serve as radar into her brain.Somewhere on the other side of the wall, she knows, half a dozen personnel techs are sitting in a control room, looking at a big screen blow up of her pupils.Then she feels a burning prick in her forearm and knows she's been injected with something.Which means it's not a normal polygraph exam.Today she's in for something special.The burning spreads throughout her body, her heart thumps, eyes water.She's been shot up with caffeine to make her hyper, make her talkative.So much for getting any work done today.Sometimes these things go for twelve hours.What is your name?a voice says.It's an unnaturally calm and liquid voice.Computer generated.That way, everything it says to her is impartial, stripped of emotional content, she has no way to pick up any cues as to how the interrogation is going.The caffeine, and the other things that they inject her with, screw up her sense of time also.She hates these things, but it happens to everyone from time to time, and when you go to work for the Feds, you sign on the dotted line and give permission for it.In a way, it's a mark of pride and honor.Everyone who works for the Feds has their heart in it.Because if they didn't, it would come out plain as day when it is their turn to sit in this chair.The questions go on and on.Mostly nonsense questions.Have you ever been to Scotland?Is white bread more expensive than wheat bread?This is just to get her settled down, get all systems running smoothly.They throw out all the stuff they get from the first hour of the interrogation, because it's lost in the noise.She can feel herself relaxing into it.They say that after a few polygraphs, you learn to relax, the whole thing goes quicker.The chair holds her in place, the caffeine keeps her from getting drowsy, the sensory deprivation clears out her mind.What is your daughter's nickname?Y. T.   How do you refer to your daughter?I call her by her nickname.Y. T.  She kind of insists on it.Does Y. T.  have a job?Yes.She works as Kourier.She works for RadiKS.How much money does Y. T.  make as a Kourier?I don't know.A few bucks here and there.How often does she purchase new equipment for her job?I'm not aware.I don't really keep track of that.Has Y. T.  done anything unusual lately?That depends on what you mean.She knows she's equivocating.She's always doing things that some people might label as unusual.That doesn't sound too good, sounds like an endorsement of nonconformity.I guess what I'm saying is, she's always doing unusual things.Has Y. T.  broken anything in the house recently?Yes.She gives up.The Feds already know this, her house is bugged and tapped, it's a wonder it doesn't short out the electrical grid, all the extra stuff wired into it.She broke my computer.Did she give an explanation for why she broke the computer?Yes.Sort of.I mean, if nonsense counts as an explanation.What was her explanation?She was afraidthis is so ridiculousshe was afraid I was going to catch a virus from it.Was Y. T.  also afraid of catching this virus?No.She said that only programmers could catch it.Why are they asking her all of these questions?They have all of this stuff on tape.Did you believe Y. T.'s explanation of why she broke the computer?That's it.That's what they're after.They want to know the only thing they can't directly tapwhat's going on in her mind.They want to know whether she believes Y. T.'s virus story.And she knows she's making a mistake just thinking these thoughts.Because those supercooled SQUIDs around her head are picking it up.They can't tell what she's thinking.But they can tell that something's going on in her brain, that she's using parts of her brain right now that she didn't use when they were asking the nonsense questions.In other words, they can tell that she is analyzing the situation, trying to figure them out.And she wouldn't be doing that unless she wanted to hide something.What is it you want to know?she says.Why don't you just come out and ask me directly?Let's talk about this face to face.Just sit down together in a room like adults and talk about it.She feels another sharp prick in her arm, feels numbness and coldness spreading all across her body over an interval of a couple of seconds as the drug mixes with her bloodstream.It's getting harder to follow the conversation.What is your name?the voice says.39  The Alcanthe Alaska Highwayis the world's longest franchise ghetto, a one dimensional city two thousand miles long and a hundred feet wide, and growing at the rate of a hundred miles a year, or as quickly as people can drive up to the edge of the wilderness and park their bagos in the next available slot.It is the only way out for people who want to leave America but don't have access to an airplane or a ship.It's all two lane, paved but not well paved, and choked with mobile homes, family vans, pickup trucks with camper backs.It starts somewhere in the middle of British Columbia, at the crossroads of Prince George, where a number of tributaries feed in together to make a single northbound highway.South of there, the tributaries split into a delta of feeder roads that crosses the Canadian/American border at a dozen or more places spread out over five hundred miles from the fjords of British Columbia to the vast striped wheatlands of central Montana.Then it ties into the American road system, which serves as the headwaters of the migration.This five hundred mile swath of territory is filled with wouldbe arctic explorers in great wheeled houses, optimistically northbound, and more than a few rejects who have abandoned their bagos in the north country and hitched a ride back down south.The lumbering bagos and top heavy four wheelers form a moving slalom course for Hiro on his black motorcycle.All these beefy Caucasians with guns!Get enough of them together, looking for the America they always believed they'd grow up in, and they glom together like overcooked rice, form integral, starchy little units.With their power tools, portable generators, weapons, four wheel drive vehicles, and personal computers, they are like beavers hyped up on crystal meth, manic engineers without a blueprint, chewing through the wilderness, building things and abandoning them, altering the flow of mighty rivers and then moving on because the place ain't what it used to be.The byproduct of the lifestyle is polluted rivers, greenhouse effect, spouse abuse, televangelists, and serial killers.But as long as you have that four wheel drive vehicle and can keep driving north, you can sustain it, keep moving just quickly enough to stay one step ahead of your own waste stream.In twenty years, ten million white people will converge on the north pole and park their bagos there.The low grade waste heat of their thermodynamically intense lifestyle will turn the crystalline icescape pliable and treacherous.It will melt a hole through the polar icecap, and all that metal will sink to the bottom, sucking the biomass down with it.For a fee, you can drive into a Snooze 'n' Cruise franchise and umbilical your bago.The magic words are We Have Pull Thrus, which means you can enter the franchise, hook up, sleep, unhook, and drive out without ever having to shift your land zeppelin into reverse.They used to claim it was a campground, tried to design the franchise with a rustic motif, but the customers kept chopping up those log and plank signs and wooden picnic tables and using them for cooking fires.Nowadays, the signs are electric polycarbonate bubbles, the corporate identity is all round and polished and smooth, in the same way that a urinal is, to prevent stuff from building up in the cracks.Because it's not really camping when you don't have a house to go back to.Sixteen hours out of California, Hiro pulls into a Snooze 'n' Cruise on the eastern slope of the Cascades in northern Oregon.He's several hundred miles north of where the Raft is, and on the wrong side of the mountains.But there's a guy here he wants to interview.There are three parking lots.One out of sight down a pitted dirt road marked with falling down signs.One a little bit closer, with scary hairys hanging around its edges, silvery disks flashing and popping under the full moon as they aim the bottoms of their beer cans at the sky.And one right in front of the Towne Hall, with gun toting attendants.You have to pay to park in that lot.Hiro decides to pay.He leaves his bike pointing outward, puts the bios into warm shutdown so he can hot boot it later if he has to, throws some Kongbucks at an attendant.Then he turns his head back and forth like a hunting dog, sniffing the still air, trying to find the Glade.There's an area a hundred feet away, under the moonlight, where a few people have been adventurous enough to pitch a tent; usually, these are the ones with the most guns, or the least to lose.Hiro goes in that direction, and pretty soon he can see the spreading canopy over the Glade.Everyone else calls it the Body Lot.It is, simply, an open patch of ground, formerly grass covered, now covered with successive truckloads of sand that have become mingled with litter, broken glass, and human waste.A canopy is stretched over it to keep out the rain, and big mushroom shaped hoods stick out of the ground every few feet, exhaling warm air on cold nights.It is pretty cheap to sleep in the Glade.It is an innovation that was created by some of the franchises farther south and has been spreading northward along with its clientele.About half a dozen of them are scattered around under the warm air vents, bandaged against the chill in their army blankets.A couple of them have a small fire going, are playing cards by its light.Hiro ignores them, starts wandering around through the remainder.Chuck Wrightson, he says.Mr.President, are you here?The second time he says it, a pile of wool off to his left begins to writhe and thrash around.A head comes out of it.Hiro turns toward him, holds up his hands to prove he's unarmed.Who is that?he says.He is abjectly terrified.Raven?Not Raven, Hiro says.Don't worry.Are you Chuck Wrightson?Former President of the Temporary Republic of Kenai and Kodiak?Yeah.What do you want?I don't have any money.Just to talk.I work for CIC, and my job is to gather intelligence.I need a fucking drink, Chuck Wrightson says.The Towne Hall is a big inflatable building in the middle of the Snooze 'n' Cruise.It is Derelict Las Vegas: convenience store, video arcade, laundromat, bar, liquor store, flea market, whorehouse.It always seems to be ruled by that small percentage of the human population that is capable of partying until five in the morning every single night, and that has no other function.Most Towne Halls have a few franchises within franchises.Hiro sees a Kelley's Tap, which is about the nicest trough you are likely to find at a Snooze 'n' Cruise, and leads Chuck Wrightson into it.Chuck is wearing many layers of clothing that used to be different colors.Now they are the same color as his skin, which is khaki.All the businesses in a Towne Hall, including this bar, look like something you'd see on a prison shipeverything nailed down, brightly lit up twenty four hours a day, all of the personnel sealed up behind thick glass barriers that have gone all yellow and murky.Security at this Towne Hall is provided by The Enforcers, so there are a lot of steroid addicts in black armorgel outfits, cruising up and down the arcade in twos and threes, enthusiastically violating people's human rights.Hiro and Chuck grab the closest thing they can find to a corner table.Hiro buttonholes a waiter and surreptitiously orders a pitcher of Pub Special, mixed half and half with nonalcoholic beer.This way, Chuck ought to remain awake a little longer than he would otherwise.It doesn't take much to make him open up.He's like one of these old guys from a disgraced presidential administration, forced out by scandal, who devotes the rest of his life to finding people who will listen to him.Yeah, I was president of TROKK for two years.And I still consider myself the president of the government in exile.Hiro tries to keep himself from rolling his eyes.Chuck seems to notice.Okay, okay, so that's not much.But TROKK was a thriving country, for a while.There's a lot of people who'd like to see something like that rise again.I mean, the only thing that forced us outthe only way those maniacs were able to seize powerwas just totally, you know He doesn't seem to have words for it.How could you have expected something like that?How were you forced out?Was there a civil war?There were some uprisings, early on.And there were remote parts of Kodiak where we never had a firm grip on power.But there was never a civil war per se.See, the Americans liked our government.The Americans had all the weapons, the equipment, the infrastructure.The Orthos were just a bunch of hairy guys running around in the woods.Orthos?Russian Orthodox.At first they were a tiny minority.Mostly Indiansyou know, Tlingits and Aleuts who'd been converted by the Russians hundreds of years ago.But when things got crazy in Russia, they started to pour across the Dateline in all kinds of different boats.And they didn't want a constitutional democracy.No.No way.What did they want?A tsar?No.Those tsar guysthe traditionalistsstayed in Russia.The Orthos who came to TROKK were total rejects.They had been forced out by the mainline Russian Orthodox church.Why?Yeretic.That's how Russians say heretic. 'The Orthos who came to TROKK were a new sectall Pente costals.They were tied in somehow with the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates.We had missionaries from Texas coming up all the goddamn time to meet with them.They were always speaking in tongues.The mainline Russian Orthodox church thought it was the work of the devil.So how many of these Pentecostal Russian Orthodox people came over to TROKK?Jeez, a hell of a lot of them.At least fifty thousand.How many Americans were in TROKK?Close to a hundred thousand.Then how exactly did the Orthos manage to take the place over?Well, one morning we woke up and there was an Airstream parked in the middle of Government Square in New Washington, right in the middle of all the bagos where we had set up the government.The Orthos had towed it there during the night, then took the wheels off so it couldn't be moved.We figured it was a protest action.We told them to move it out of there.They refused and issued a proclamation, in Russian.When we got this damn thing translated, it turned out to be an order for us to pack up and leave and turn over power to the Orthos.Well, this was ridiculous.So we went up to this Airstream to move it out of there, and Gurov's waiting for us with this nasty grin on his face.Gurov?Yeah.One of the Refus who came over the Date line from the Soviet Union.Former KGB general turned religious fanatic.He was kind of like the Minister of Defense for the government that the Orthos set up.So Gurov opens the side door of the Airstream and lets us get a load of what's inside.What was inside?Well, mostly it was a bunch of equipment, you know, a portable generator, electrical wiring, a control panel, and so forth.But in the middle of the trailer, there's this big black cone sitting on the floor.About the shape of an ice cream cone, except it's about five feet long and it's smooth and black.And I asked what the hell is that thing.And Gurov says, that thing is a ten megaton hydrogen bomb we scavenged from a ballistic missile.A city buster.Any more questions?So you capitulated.Couldn't do much else.Do you know how the Orthos came to be in possession of a hydrogen bomb?Chuck Wrightson clearly knows.He sucks in his deepest breath of the evening, lets it out, shakes his head, staring off over Hiro's shoulder.He takes a couple of nice long swigs from his glass of beer.There was a Soviet nuclear missile submarine.The commander was named Ovchinnikov.He was religiously faithful, but he wasn't a fanatic like the Orthos.I mean, if he had been a fanatic they wouldn't have given him command of a nuclear missile submarine, right?Supposedly.You had to be psychologically stable.Whatever that means.Anyway, after things fell apart in Russia, he found himself in possession of this very dangerous weapon.He made up his mind that he was going to offload all of the crew and then scuttle it in the Marianas Trench.Bury all those weapons forever.But, somehow, he was persuaded to use this submarine to help a bunch of the Orthos escape to Alaska.They, and a lot of other Refus, had started flocking to the Bering coast.And the conditions in some of these Refu camps were pretty desperate.It's not like a lot of food can be grown in that area, you know.These people were dying by the thousands.They just stood on the beaches, starving to death, waiting for a ship to come.So Ovchinnikov let himself be persuaded to use his submarinewhich is very large and very fastto evacuate some of these poor Refus to TROKK.But, naturally, he was paranoid about the idea of letting a whole bunch of unknown quantities onto his ship.These nuke sub commanders are real security freaks, for obvious reasons.So they set up a very strict system.All the Refus who were going to get on the ship had to pass through metal detectors, had to be inspected.Then they were under armed guard all the way across to Alaska.Well, the Stern Orthos have this guy named Raven  I'm familiar with him.Well, Raven got onto that nuclear submarine.Oh, my God.He got over to the Siberian coast somehowprobably surfed across in his fucking kayak.Surfed?That's how the Aleuts get between islands.Raven's an Aleut?Yeah.An Aleut whale killer.You know what an Aleut is?Yeah.My Dad knew one in Japan, Hiro says.A bunch of Dad's old prison camp tales are beginning to stir in Hiro's memory, working their way up out of deep, deep storage.The Aleuts just paddle out in their kayaks and catch a wave.They can outrun a steamship, you know.Didn't know that.Anyway, Raven went to one of these Refu camps and passed himself off as a Siberian tribesman.You can't tell some of those Siberians apart from our Indians.The Orthos apparently had some confederates in these camps who bumped Raven up to the head of the line, so he got to be on the submarine.But you said there was a metal detector.Didn't help.He uses glass knives.Chips them out of plate glass.It's the sharpest blade in the universe, you know.Didn't know that either.Yeah.The edge is only a single molecule wide.Doctors use them for eye surgerythey can cut your cornea and not leave a scar.There's Indians who make a living doing that, you know.Chipping out eye scalpels.Well, you learn something new every day.That kind of a knife would be sharp enough to go through bullet proof fabric, I guess, Hiro says.Chuck Wrightson shrugs.I lost track of the number of people Raven snuffed who were wearing bulletproof fabric.Hiro says, I thought he must be carrying some kind of high tech laser knife or something.Think again.Glass knife.He had one on board the submarine.Either smuggled it on board with him, or else found a chunk of glass on the submarine and chipped it out himself.And?Chuck gets his thousand yard stare again, takes another slug of beer.On a sub, you know, there's no place for things to drain to.The survivors claimed that the blood was knee deep all through the submarine.Raven just killed everyone.Everyone except the Orthos, a skeleton crew, and some other Refus who were able to barricade themselves in little compartments around the ship.The survivors say, Chuck says, taking another swig, that it was quite a night.And he forced them to steer the submarine into the hands of the Orthos.To their anchorage off Kodiak, Chuck says.The Orthos were all ready.They had put together a crew of ex Navy men, guys who had worked on nuke subs in the pastX rays, they call themand they came and took the sub over.As for us, we had no idea that any of this had happened.Until one of the warheads showed up in our goddamn front yard.Chuck glances up above Hiro's head, noticing someone.Hiro feels a light tap on his shoulder.Excuse me, sir?a man is saying.Pardon me for just a second?40  Hiro turns around.It's a big porky white man with wavy, slicked back red hair and a beard.He's got a baseball cap perched on top of his head, tilted way back to expose the following words, tattooed in block letters across his forehead:    MOOD SWINGS  RACIALLY INSENSITIVE    Hiro is looking up at all of this over the curving horizon of the man's flannel clad belly.What is it?Hiro says.Well, sir, I'm sorry to disturb you in the middle of your conversation with this gentleman here.But me and my friends were just wondering.Are you a lazy shiftless watermelon eating black ass nigger, or a sneaky little v. d.  infected gook?The man reaches up, pulls the brim of his baseball cap downward.Now Hiro can see the Confederate flag printed on the front, the embroidered words New South Africa Franchulate #153.Hiro pushes himself up over the table, spins around, and slides backward on his ass toward Chuck, trying to get the table between him and the New South African.Chuck has conveniently vanished, so Hiro ends up standing with his back comfortably to the wall, looking out over the bar.At the same time, a dozen or so other men are standing up from their tables, forming up behind the first one in a grinning, sunburned phalanx of Confederate flags and sideburns.Let's see, Hiro says, is that some kind of a trick question?There are a lot of Towne Halls in a lot of Snooze 'n' Cruise franchises where you have to check your weapons at the entrance.This is not one of them.Hiro isn't sure if that is bad or good.Without weapons, the New South Africans would just beat the crap out of him.With weapons, Hiro can fight back, but the stakes are higher.Hiro is bulletproof up to his neck, but that just means the New South Africans will all be going for a head shot.And they pride themselves on marksmanship.It is a fetish with them.Isn't there an NSA franchise down the road?Hiro says.Yeah, says the point man, who has a long, spreading body and short stumpy legs.It's heaven.It really is.Ain't no place on earth like a New South Africa.Well, then if you don't mind my asking, Hiro says, if it's so damn nice, why don't y'all go back to your egg sac and hang out there?There is one problem with New South Africa, the guy says.Don't mean to sound unpatriotic, but it's true.And what is that problem?Hiro says.There's no niggers, gooks, or kikes there to beat the shit out of.Ah.That is a problem, Hiro says.Thank you.For what?For announcing your intentionsgiving me the right to do this.Then Hiro cuts his head off.What else can he do?There are at least twelve of them.They have made a point of blocking the only exit.They have just announced their intentions.And presumably they are all carrying heat.Besides, this kind of thing is going to happen to him about every ten seconds when he's on the Raft.The New South African has no idea what's coming, but he starts to react as Hiro is swinging the katana at his neck, so he is flying backward when the decapitation occurs.That is good, because about half his blood supply comes lofting out the top of his neck.Twin jets, one from each carotid.Hiro doesn't get a drop on himself.In the Metaverse, the blade just passes right through, if you swing it quickly enough.Here in Reality, Hiro's expecting a powerful shock when his blade hits the New South African's neck, like when you hit a baseball the wrong way, but he hardly feels a thing.It just goes right through and almost swings around and buries itself in the wall.He must have gotten lucky and hit a gap between vertebrae.Hiro's training comes back to him, oddly.He forgot to squeeze it off, forgot to stop the blade himself, and that's bad form.Even though he's expecting it, he's startled for a minute.This sort of thing doesn't happen with avatars.They just fall down.For an astonishingly long time, he just stands there and looks at the guy's body.Meanwhile, the airborne cloud of blood is seeking its level, dripping from the hung ceiling, spattering down from shelves behind the bar.A wino sitting there nursing a double shot of vodka shakes and shivers, staring into his glass at the galactic swirl of a trillion red cells dying in the ethanol.Hiro swaps a few long glances with the New South Africans, like everyone in the bar is trying to come to a consensus as to what will happen next.Should they laugh?Take a picture?Run away?Call an ambulance?He makes his way around toward the exit by running across people's tables.It is rude, but other patrons scoot back, some of them are quick enough to snatch their beers out of his way, and no one gives him any hassles.The sight of the bare katana inspires everyone to a practically Nipponese level of politeness.There are a couple more New South Africans blocking Hiro's way out, but not because they want to stop anyone.It's just where they happen to be standing when they go into shock.Hiro decides, reflexively, not to kill them.And Hiro is off into the lurid main avenue of the Towne Hall, a tunnel of flickering and pulsating loglo through which black creatures sprint like benighted sperm up the old fallopians, sharp angular things clenched in their hands.They are The Enforcers.They make the average MetaCop look like Ranger Rick.Gargoyle time.Hiro switches everything on: infrared, millimeter wave radar, ambient sound processing.The infrared doesn't do much in these circumstances, but the radar picks out all the weapons, highlights them in The Enforcers' hands, identifies them by make, model, and ammunition type.They're all fully automatic.But The Enforcers and the New South Africans don't need radar to see Hiro's katana with blood and spinal fluid running down the blade.The music of Vitaly Chernobyl and the Meltdowns is blasting through bad speakers all around him.It is their first single to hit the Billboard charts, entitled My Heart Is a Smoking Hole in the Ground.The ambient sound processing cuts it to a more reasonable level, evens out the nasty distortion from the speakers so that he can hear his roommate singing more clearly.Which makes it all particularly surreal.It just goes to show that he's out of his element.Doesn't belong here.Lost in the biomass.If there was any justice, he could jump into those speakers and trace up the wires like a digital sylph, follow the grid back to L. A. , where he belongs, there on top of the world, where everything comes from, buy Vitaly a drink, crawl into his futon.He stumbles forward helplessly as something terrible happens to his back.It feels like being massaged with a hundred ballpeen hammers.At the same time, a yellow sputtering light overrides the loglo.A screaming red display flashes up on the goggles informing him that the millimeter wave radar has noticed a stream of bullets headed in his direction and would you like to know where they came from, sir?Hiro has just been shot in the back with a burst of machine gun fire.All of the bullets have slapped into his vest and dropped to the floor, but in doing so they have cracked about half of the ribs on that side of his body and bruised a few internal organs.He turns around, which hurts.The Enforcer has given up on bullets and whipped out another weapon.It says so right on Hiro's goggles: PACIFIC ENFORCEMENT HARDWARE, INC.MODEL SX 29 RESTRAINT PROJECTION DEVICE (LOOGIE GUN).Which is what he should have used in the first place.You can't just carry a sword around as an empty threat.You shouldn't draw it, or keep it drawn, unless you intend to kill someone.Hiro runs toward The Enforcer, raising the katana to strike.The Enforcer does the proper thing, namely, gets the hell out of his way.The silver ribbon of the katana shines up above the crowd.It attracts Enforcers and repels everyone else, so as Hiro runs down the center of the Towne Hall, he has no one in front of him and many shiny dark creatures behind him.He turns off all of the techno shit in his goggles.All it does is confuse him; he stands there reading statistics about his own death even as it's happening to him.Very post modern.Time to get immersed in Reality, like all the people around him.Not even Enforcers will fire their big guns in a crowd, unless it's point blank range, or they're in a really bad mood.A few loogies shoot past Hiro, already so spread out as to be nothing more than an annoyance, and splat into bystanders, wrapping them in sticky gossamer veils.Somewhere between the 3 D video game arcade and the display window full of terminally bored prostitutes, Hiro's eyes clear up and he sees a miracle: the exit of the inflatable dome, where the doors exhale a breeze of synthetic beer breath and atomized body fluids into the cool night air.Bad things and good things are happening in quick succession.The next bad thing happens when a steel grate falls down to block the doors.What the hell, it's an inflatable building.Hiro turns on the radar just for a moment and the walls seem to drop away and become invisible; he's seeing through them now, into the forest of steel outside.It doesn't take long to locate the parking lot where he left his bike, supposedly under the protection of some armed attendants.Hiro fakes toward the whorehouse, then cuts directly toward an exposed section of wall.The fabric of the building is tough, but his katana slices a six foot rent through it with a single gliding motion, and then he's outside, spat out of the hole on a jet of fetid air.After thatafter Hiro gets onto his motorcycle, and the New South Africans get into their all terrain pickups, and The Enforcers get into their slick black Enforcer mobiles, and they all go screaming out onto the highwayafter that it's just a chase scene.41  Y. T.  has been to some unusual places in her career.She has the visas of some three dozen countries laminated onto her chest.And on top of the real countries she has picked up and/or delivered to such charming little vacation spots as the Terminal Island Sacrifice Zone and the encampment in Griffith Park.But the weirdest job of all is this new one: someone wants her to deliver some stuff to the United States of America.Says so right there on the job order.It's not much of a delivery, just a legal size envelope.You sure you don't just want to mail this?she asks the guy when she picks it up.It's one of these creepy office parks out in the Burbs.Like a Burbclave for worthless businesses that have offices and phones and stuff but don't actually seem to do anything.It's a sarcastic question, of course.The mail doesn't work, except in Fedland.All the mailboxes have been unbolted and used to decorate the apartments of nostalgia freaks.But it's also kind of a joke, because the destination is, in fact, a building in the middle of Fedland.So the joke is: If you want to deal with the Feds, why not use their fucked up mail system?Aren't you afraid that by dealing with anything as incredibly cool as a Kourier you will be tainted in their eyes?Well, uh, the mail doesn't come out here, does it?the guy says.No point in describing the office.No point in even allowing the office to even register on her eyeballs and take up valuable memory space in her brain.Fluorescent lights and partitions with carpet glued to them.I prefer my carpet on the floor, thank you.A color scheme.Ergonomic shit.Chicks with lipstick.Xerox smell.Everything's pretty new, she figures.The legal envelope is resting on the guy's desk.Not much point in describing him, either.Traces of a southern or Texan accent.The bottom edge of the envelope is parallel to the edge of the desk, one quarter inch away from it, perfectly centered between the left and right sides.Like he had a doctor come in here and put it on the desk with tweezers.It is addressed to: ROOM 968A, MAIL STOP MS 1569835, BUILDING LA 6, UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.You want a return address on this?she says.That's not necessary.If I can't deliver it, there's no way I can get it back to you, because these places all look the same to me.It's not important, he says.When do you think you'll get it there?Two hours max.Why so long?Customs, man.The Feds haven't modernized their system like everyone else.Which is why most Kouriers will do anything to avoid delivering to Fedland.But it's a slow day today, Y. T.  hasn't been called in to do any secret missions for the Mafia yet, and maybe she can catch Mom on her lunch break.And your name is?We don't give out our names.I need to know who's delivering this.Why?You said it wasn't important.The guy gets really flustered.Okay, he says.Forget it.Just deliver it, please.Okay, be that way, she mentally says.She mentally says a number of other things, too.The man is an obvious pervert.It's so plain, so open: And your name is?Give me a break, man.Names are unimportant.Everyone knows Kouriers are interchangeable parts.It's just that some happen to be a lot faster and better.So she skates out of the office.It's all very anonymous.No corporate logos anywhere.So as she's waiting for the elevator, she calls RadiKS, tries to find out who initiated this call.The answer comes back a few minutes later, as she's riding out of the office park, pooned onto a nice Mercedes: Rife Advanced Research Enterprises.RARE.One of these high tech outfits.Probably trying to get a government contract.Probably trying to sell sphygmomanometers to the Feds or something like that.Oh well, she just delivers 'em.She gets the impression that this Mercedes is sandbaggingdriving real slow so she'll poon something elseso she poons something else, an outgoing delivery truck.Judging from the way it's riding high on its springs, it must be empty, so it'll probably move along pretty fast.Ten seconds later, predictably, the Mercedes blasts by in the left lane, so she poons that and rides it nice and hard for a couple of miles.Getting into Fedland is a drag.Most Fedsters drive tiny, plastic and aluminum cars that are hard to poon.But eventually she nails one, a little jellybean with glued on windows and a three cylinder engine, and that takes her up to the United States border.The smaller this country gets, the more paranoid they become.Nowadays, the customs people are just impossible.She has to sign a ten page documentand they actually make her read it.They say it should take at least half an hour for her just to read the thing.But I read it two weeks ago.It might have changed, the guard says, so you have to read it again.Basically, it just certifies that Y. T.  is not a terrorist, Communist (whatever that is), homosexual, national symbol desecrator, pornography merchant, welfare parasite, racially insensitive, carrier of any infectious disease, or advocate of any ideology tending to impugn traditional family values.Most of it is just definitions of all the words used on the first page.So Y. T.  sits in the little room for half an hour, doing housekeeping workgoing over her stuff, changing batteries in all her little devices, cleaning her nails, having her skateboard run its self maintenance procedures.Then she signs the fucking document and hands it over to the guy.And then she's in Fedland.It's not hard finding the place.Typical Fed buildinga million steps.Like it's built on top of a mountain of steps.Columns.A lot more guys in this one than usual.Chunky guys with slippery hair.Must be some kind of cop building.The guard at the front door is a cop all the way, wants to give her a big hassle about carrying her skateboard into the place.Like they've got a safe place out front to keep skateboards.The cop guy is completely hard to deal with.But that's okay, so is Y. T.   Here's the envelope, she says.You can take it up to the ninth floor yourself on your coffee break.Too bad you have to take the stairs.Look, he says, totally exasperated, this is EBGOC.This is, like, the headquarters.EBGOC central.You got that?Everything that happens within a mile is being videotaped.People don't spit on the pavement within sight of this building.They don't even say bad words.Nobody's going to steal your skateboard.That's even worse.They'll steal it.Then they'll say they didn't steal it, they confiscated it.I know you Feds, you're always confiscating shit.The guy sighs.Then his eyes go out of focus and he shuts up for a minute.Y. T.  can tell he's getting a message over the little earphone that's plugged into his ear, the mark of the true Fed.Go on in, he says.But you gotta sign.Naturally, Y. T.  says.The cop hands her the sign in sheet, which is actually a notebook computer with an electronic pen.She writes Y. T.  on the screen, it's converted to a digital bitmap, automatically time stamped, and sent off to the big computer at Fed Central.She knows she's not going to make it through the metal detector without stripping naked, so she just vaults the cop's tablewhat's he going to do, shoot her?and heads on into the building, skateboard under her arm.Hey!he says, weakly.What, you got lots of EBGOC agents in here being mugged and raped by female Kouriers?she says, stomping the elevator button ferociously.Elevator takes forever.She loses her patience and just climbs the stairs like all the other Feds.The guy is right, it's definitely Cop Central here on the ninth floor.Every creepy guy in sunglasses and slippery hair you've ever seen, they're all here, all with little fleshtone helices of wire trailing down from their ears.There's even some female Feds.They look even scarier than the guys.The things that a woman can do to her hair to make herself look professionalJeeezus!Why not just wear a motorcycle helmet?At least then you can take it off.Except none of the Feds, male or female, is wearing sunglasses.They look naked without them.Might as well be walking around with no pants on.Seeing these Feds without their mirror specs is like blundering into the boys' locker room.She finds Room 968A easily enough.Most of the floor is just a big pool of desks.All the actual, numbered rooms are around the edges, with frosted glass doors.Each of the creepy guys seems to have a desk of his own, some of them loiter near their desks, the rest of them are doing a lot of hall jogging and impromptu conferencing at other creepy guys' desks.Their white shirts are painfully clean.Not as many shoulder holsters as she would expect; all the gun carrying Feds are probably out in what used to be Alabama or Chicago trying to confiscate back bits of United States territory from what is now a Buy 'n' Fly or a toxic waste dump.She goes on into Room 968A.It's an office.Four Fed guys are in here, the same as the others except most of them are a tad older, in their forties and fifties.Got a delivery for this room, Y. T.  says.You're Y. T. ?says the head Fed, who's sitting behind the desk.You're not supposed to know my name, Y. T.  says.How did you know my name?I recognized you, the head Fed says.I know your mother.Y. T.  does not believe him.But these Feds have all kinds of ways of finding out stuff.Do you have any relatives in Afghanistan?she says.The guys all look back and forth at each other, like, did you understand the chick?But it's not a sentence that is intended to be understood.Actually, Y. T.  has all kinds of voice recognition ware in her coverall and in her plank.When she says, Do you have any relatives in Afghanistan?that's like a code phrase, it tells all of her spook gear to get ready, shake itself down, check itself out, prick up its electronic ears.You want this envelope or not?she says.I'll take it, the head Fed says, standing up and holding out one hand.Y. T.  walks into the middle of the room and hands him the envelope.But instead of taking it, he lunges out at the last minute and grabs her forearm.She sees an open handcuff in his other hand.He brings it out and snaps it down on her wrist so it tightens and locks shut over the cuff of her coverall.I'm sorry to do this, Y. T. , but I have to place you under arrest, he's saying.What the fuck are you doing?Y. T.  is saying.She's holding her free arm back away from the desk so he can't cuff her wrists together, but one of the other Feds grabs her by the free wrist, so now she's stretched out like a tightrope between the two big Feds.You guys are dead, she says.All the guys smile, like they enjoy a chick with some spunk.You guys are dead, she says a second time.This is the key phrase that all of her ware is waiting to hear.When she says it the second time, all the self defense stuff comes on, which means that among other things, a few thousand volts of radio frequency electrical power suddenly flood through the outsides of her cuffs.The head Fed behind the desk blurts out a grunt from way down in his stomach.He flies back away from her, his entire right side jerking spastically, trips over his own chair, and sprawls back into the wall, smacking his head on the marble windowsill.The jerk who's yanking on her other arm stretches out like he's on an invisible rack, accidentally slapping one of the other guys in the face, giving that guy a nice dose of juice to the head.Both of them hit the floor like a sack of rabid cats.There's only one of these guys left, and he's reaching under his jacket for something.She takes one step toward him, swings her arm around, and the end of the loose manacle strokes him in the neck.Just a caress, but it might as well be a two handed blow from Satan's electric ax handle.That funky juice runs all up and down his spine, and suddenly, he's sprawled across a couple of shitty old wooden chairs and his pistol is rotating on the floor like the spinner in a children's game.She flexes her wrist in a particular way, and the bundy stunner drops down her sleeve and into her hand.The manacle swinging from the other hand will have a similar efffect on that side.She also pulls out the can of Liquid Knuckles, pops the lid, sets the spray nozzle on wide angle.One of the Fed creeps is nice enough to open the office door for her.He comes into the room with his gun already drawn, backed up by half a dozen other guys who've flocked here from the office pool, and she just lets them have it with the Liquid Knuckles.Whoosh, it's like bug spray.The sound of bodies hitting the floor is like a bass drum roll.She finds that her skateboard has no problem rolling across their prone bodies, and then she's out into the office pool.These guys are converging from all sides, there's an incredible number of them, she just keeps holding that button down, pointed straight ahead, digging at the floor with her foot, building up speed.The Liquid Knuckles act like a chemical flying wedge, she's skating out of there on a carpet of bodies.Some of the Feds are agile enough to dart in from behind and try to get her that way, but she's ready with the bundy stunner, which turns their nervous systems into coils of hot barbed wire for a few minutes but isn't supposed to have any other effects.She's made it about three quarters of he way across the office when the Liquid Knuckles runs out.But it still works for a second or two because people are afraid of it, keep diving out of the way even though there's nothing coming out.Then a couple of them figure it out, make the mistake of trying to grab her by the wrists.She gets one of them with the bundy stunner and the other with the electric manacle.Then boom through the door and she's out into the stairwell, leaving four dozen casualties in her wake.Serves them right, they didn't even try to arrest her in a gentlemanly way.To a man on foot, stairs are a hindrance.But to the smartwheels, they just look like a forty five degree angle ramp.It's a little choppy, especially when she's down to about the second floor and is going way too fast, but it's definitely doable.A lucky thing: One of the first floor cops is just opening the stairwell door, no doubt alerted by the symphony of alarm bells and buzzers that has begun to merge into a solid wall of hysterical sound.She blows by the guy; he puts one arm out in an attempt to stop her, sort of belts her across the waist in the process, throws her balance off, but this is a very forgiving skateboard, it's smart enough to slow down for her a little bit when her center of mass gets into the wrong place.Pretty soon it's back under her, she's banking radically through the elevator lobby, aiming dead center for the arch of the metal detector, through which the bright outdoor light of freedom is shining.Her old buddy the cop is up on his feet, and he reacts fast enough to spread eagle himself across the metal detector.Y. T.  acts like she's heading right for him, then kicks the board sideways at the last minute, punches one of the toe switches, coils her legs underneath her, and jumps into the air.She flies right over his little table while the plank is rolling underneath it, and a second later she lands on it, wobbles once, gets her balance back.She's in the lobby, headed for the doors.It's an old building.Most of the doors are metal.But there's a couple of revolving doors, too, just big sheets of glass.Early thrashers used to inadvertently skate into walls of glass from time to time, which was a problem.It turned into a bigger problem when the whole Kourier thing got started and thrashers started spending a lot more time trying to go fast through office type environments where glass walls are considered quite the concept.Which is why on an expensive skateboard, like this one definitely is, you can get, as an extra added safety feature, the RadiKS Narrow Cone Tuned Shock Wave Projector.It works on real short notice, which is good, but you can only use it once (it draws its power from an explosive charge), and then you have to take your plank into the shop to have it replaced.It's an emergency thing.Strictly a panic button.But that's cool.Y. T.  makes sure she's aimed directly at the glass revolving doors, then hits the appropriate toe switch.It'smy Godlike you stretched a tarp across a stadium to turn it into a giant tom tom and then crashed a 747 into it.She can feel her internal organs move several inches.Her heart trades places with her liver.The bottoms of her feet feel numb and tingly.And she's not even standing in the path of the shock wave.The safety glass in the revolving doors doesn't just crack and fall to the floor, like she imagined it would.It is blown out of its moorings.It gushes out of the building and down the front steps.She follows, an instant later.The ridiculous cascade of white marble steps on the front of the building just gives her more ramp time.By the time she reaches the sidewalk, she's easily got enough speed to coast all the way to Mexico.As she's swinging out across the broad avenue, aiming her crosshairs at the customs post a quarter mile away, which she is going to have to jump over, something tells her to look up.Because after all, the building she just escaped from is towering above her, many stories full of Fed creeps, and all the alarms are going off.Most of the windows can't be opened, all they can do is look out.But there are people on the roof.Mostly the roof is a forest of antennas.If it's a forest, these guys are the creepy little gnomes who live in the trees.They are ready for action, they have their sunglasses on, they have weapons, they're all looking at her.But only one guy's taking aim.And the thing he's aiming at her is huge.The barrel is the size of a baseball bat.She can see the muzzle flash poke out of it, wreathed in a sudden doughnut of white smoke.It's not pointed right at her; it's aimed in front of her.The stun bunny lands on the street, dead ahead, bounces up in the air, and detonates at an altitude of twenty feet.The next quarter of a second: There's no bright flash to blind her, and so she can actually see the shock wave spreading outward in a perfect sphere, hard and palpable as a ball of ice.Where the sphere contacts the street, it makes a circular wave front, making pebbles bounce, flipping old McDonald's containers that have long been smashed flat, and coaxing fine, flourlike dust out of all the tiny crevices in the pavement, so that it sweeps across the road toward her like a microscopic blizzard.Above it, the shock wave hangs in the air, rushing toward her at the speed of sound, a lens of air that flattens and refracts everything on the other side.She's passing through it.42  As Hiro crests the pass on his motorcycle at five in the morning, the town of Port Sherman, Oregon, is suddenly laid out before him: a flash of yellow loglo wrapped into a vast U shaped valley that was ground out of the rock, a long time ago, by a big tongue of ice in an epochal period of geological cunnilingus.There is just a light dusting of gold around the edges where it fades into the rain forest, thickening and intensifying as it approaches the harbora long narrow fjordlike notch cut into the straight coastline of Oregon, a deep cold trench of black water heading straight out to Japan.Hiro's back on the Rim again.Feels good after that night ride through the sticks.Too many rednecks, too many mounties.Even from ten miles away and a mile above, it's not a pretty sight.Farther away from the central harbor district, Hiro can make out a few speckles of red, which is a little better than the yellow.He wishes he could see something in green or blue or purple, but there don't seem to be any neighborhoods done up in those gourmet colors.But then this isn't exactly a gourmet job.He rides half a mile off the road, sits down on a flat rock in an open spaceambush proof, more or lessand goggles into the Metaverse.Librarian?Yes, sir?Inanna.A figure from Sumerian mythology.Later cultures knew her as Ishtar, or Esther.Good goddess or bad goddess?Good.A beloved goddess.Did she have any dealings with Enki or Asherah?Mostly with Enki.She and Enki were on good and bad terms at different times.Inanna was known as the queen of all the great me.I thought the me belonged to Enki.They did.But Inanna went to the Abzuthe watery fortress in the city of Eridu where Enki stored up the meand got Enki to give her all the me.This is how the me were released into civilization.Watery fortress, huh?Yes, sir.How did Enki feel about this?He gave them to her willingly, apparently because he was drunk, and besotted with Inanna's physical charms.When he sobered up, he tried to chase her down and get them back, but she outsmarted him.Let's get semiotic, Hiro mumbles.The Raft is L.  Bob Rife's watery fortress.That's where he stores up all of his stuff.All of his me.Juanita went to Astoria, which was as close as you could get to the Raft a couple of days ago.I think she's trying to pull an Inanna.In another popular Sumerian myth, the Librarian says, Inanna descends into the nether world.Go on, Hiro says.She gathers together all of her me and enters the land of no return.Great.She passes through the nether world and reaches the temple that is ruled over by Ereshkigal, goddess of Death.She is traveling under false pretenses, which are easily penetrated by the all seeing Ereshkigal.But Ereshkigal allows her to enter the temple.As Inanna enters, her robes and jewels and me are stripped from her and she is brought, stark naked, before Ereshkigal and the seven judges of the underworld.The judges fastened their eyes upon her, the eyes of death; at their word, the word which tortures the spirit, Inanna was turned into a corpse, a piece of rotting meat, and was hung from a hook on the wall. 'Kramer.Wonderful.Why the hell would she do something like that?As Diane Wolkstein puts it, Inanna gave up ...all she had accomplished in life until she was stripped naked, with nothing remaining but her will to be reborn ...because of her journey to the underworld, she took on the powers and mysteries of death and rebirth.Oh.So I guess there's more to the story?Inanna's messenger waits for three days, and when she fails to return from the netherworld, goes to the gods asking for their help.None of the gods is willing to help except for Enki.So our buddy, Enki, the hacker god, has to bail her ass out of Hell.Enki creates two people and sends them into the netherworld to rescue Inanna.Through their magic, Inanna is brought back to life.She returns from the netherworld, followed by a host of the dead.Juanita went to the Raft three days ago, Hiro says.It's time to get hacking.Earth is still where he left it, zoomed in to show a magnified view of the Raft.In the light of last night's chat with Chuck Wrightson, it's not hard to find the hunk of raft that was staked out by the Orthos when the Enterprise swung by TROKK a few weeks back.There's a couple of big assed Soviet freighters tied together, a swarm of small boats around them.Most of the Raft is dead brown and organic, but this section is all white fiberglass: pleasure craft looted from the comfortable retirees of TROKK.Thousands of them.Now the Raft is off Port Sherman, so, Hiro figures, that's where the high priests of Asherah are hanging out.In a few days, they'll be in Eureka, then San Francisco, then L. A. a floating land link, tying the Orthos' operations on the Raft to the closest available point on the mainland.He turns away from the Raft, skims across the ocean to Port Sherman to do a bit of reconnoitering there.Down along the waterfront, there's a nice crescent of cheap motels with yellow logos.Hiro rifles through them, looking for Russian names.That's easy.There's a Spectrum 2000 right in the middle of the waterfront.As the name implies, each one has a whole range of rooms, from human coin lockers in the lobby all the way to luxury suites on the top.And a whole range of rooms has been rented out by a bunch of people with names ending in  off and  ovski and other dead Slavic giveaways.The foot soldiers sleep in the lobby, laid out straight and narrow in coin lockers next to their AK 47s, and the priests and generals live in nice rooms higher up.Hiro pauses to wonder what a Pentecostal Russian Orthodox priest does with a Magic Fingers.The suite on the very top is being rented out by a gentleman by the name of Gurov.Mr.KGB himself.Too much of a wimp to hang out on the actual Raft, apparently.How'd he get from the Raft to Port Sherman?If it involves crossing a couple of hundred miles of North Pacific, it must be a decent sized vessel.There are half a dozen marinas in Port Sherman.At the moment, most of them are clogged with small brown boats.It looks like a post typhoon situation, where a few hundred square miles of ocean have been swept clean of sampans that have piled up against the nearest hard place.Except this is slightly more organized than that.The Refus are coming ashore already.If they're smart, and aggressive, they probably know that they can walk to California from here.That explains why the piers are clogged with trashy little boats.But one of them still looks like a private marina.It's got a dozen or so clean white vessels, lined up neatly in their slips, no riffraff.And the resolution of this image is good enough that Hiro can see the pier speckled with little doughnuts: probably rings of sandbags.That'd be the only way to keep your private moorage private when the Raft was hovering offshore.The numbers, flags, and other identifying goodies are harder to make out.The satellite has a hard time picking that stuff out.Hiro checks to see whether CIC has a stringer in Port Sherman.They have to, because the Raft is here, and CIC hopes to make a big business out of selling Raft intelligence to all the anxious waterfronters between Skagway and Tierra del Fuego.Indeed.There are a few people hanging out in this town, uploading the latest Port Sherman intel.And one of them is just a punter with a video camera who goes around shooting pictures of everything.Hiro reviews this stuff in fast forward.A lot of it is shot from the stringer's hotel window: hours and hours of coverage of the stream of shitty little brown boats laboring their way up the harbor, tying up to the edge of the mini Raft that's forming in front of Port Sherman.But it's semi organized, in that some apparently self appointed water cops are buzzing around in a speedboat, aiming guns at people, shouting through a megaphone.And that explains why, no matter how tangled the mess in the harbor becomes, there's always a clear lane down the middle of the fjord, headed out to sea.And the terminus of that clear lane is the nice pier with the big boats.There are two big vessels there.One is a large fishing boat flying a flag bearing the emblem of the Orthos, which is just a cross and a flame.It is obvious TROKK loot; the name on the stern is KODIAK QUEEN, and the Orthos haven't bothered to change it yet.The other large boat is a small cruise vessel, made to carry rich people comfortably to nice places.It has a green flag and appears to be connected with Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.Hiro does a little more poking around in the streets of Port Sherman and finds out that there is a pretty good sized Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong franchulate here.In typical Hong Kong style, it is more of a spray of small buildings and rooms all over town.But it's a dense spray.Dense enough that Hong Kong has several full time employees here, including a proconsul.Hiro pulls up the guy's picture so he'll recognize him: a crusty looking Chinese American gent in his fifties.So it's not an automated, unmanned franchulate like you normally see in the Lower 48.43  When she first woke up, she was still in her RadiKS coverall, mummified in gaffer's tape, lying on the floor of a shitty old Ford van blasting across the middle of nowhere.This did not put her into a very favorable mood.The stun bunny left her with a persistent nosebleed and an eternal throbbing headache, and every time the van hit a chuckhole, her head bounced on the corrugated steel floor.First she was just pissed.Then she started having brief moments of fearwanting to go home.After eight hours in the back of the van, there was no doubt in her mind that she wanted to go home.The only thing that kept her from giving up was curiosity.As far as she could tell from this admittedly poor vantage point, this didn't look like a Fed operation.The van pulled off the highway, onto a frontage road, and into a parking lot.The rear doors of the van opened up, and a couple of women climbed in.Through the open doors, Y. T.  could see the Gothic arch logo of a Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates.Oh, you poor baby, one of the women said.The other woman just gasped in horror at her condition.One of them just cradled her head and stroked her hair, letting her sip sweet Kool Aid from a Dixie cup, while the other tenderly, slowly took the gaffer's tape off.Her shoes had already been removed when she woke up in the back of the van, and no one offered her another pair.And everything had been removed from her coverall.All the good stuff was gone.But they hadn't gone underneath the coverall.She still had the dog tags.And one other thing, a thing between her legs called a dentata.There's no way they could have found that.She has always known that the dog tags were probably a fake thing anyway.Uncle Enzo doesn't just go around giving his war souvenirs to fifteen year old chicks.But they still might have an effect on someone.The two women are named Marla and Bonnie.They are with her all the time.Not only with her, but touching her.Lots of hugs, squeezes, hand holding, and tousled hair.The first time she goes to the bathroom, Bonnie goes with her, opening the stall door and actually standing in there with her.Y. T.  thinks that Bonnie is worried that she's going to pass out on the toilet or something.But the next time she has to pee, Marla goes with her.She gets no privacy at all.The only problem is she can't deny that she likes it, in a way.The ride in the van hurt.It really hurt bad.She never felt so lonely in her life.And now she's barefoot and defenseless in an unfamiliar place and they're giving her what she needs.After she had a few minutes to freshen upwhatever that meansinside the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates, she and Marla and Bonnie climbed into a big stretch van with no windows.The floor was carpeted but there were no seats inside, everyone sat on the floor.The van was jammed when they opened the rear doors.Twenty people were packed into it, all energetic, beaming youths.It looked impossible; Y. T.  shrank away from it, backing right into Marla and Bonnie.But a cheerful roar came up from the van people, white teeth flashing in the dimness, and people began to scrunch out a tiny space for them.She spent most of the next two days packed into the van between Bonnie and Marla, holding hands with them constantly, so she couldn't even pick her nose without permission.They sang happy songs until her brain turned to tapioca.They played wacky games.A couple of times every hour, someone in the van would start to babble, just like the Falabalas.Just like the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates people.The babbling would spread throughout the van like a contagious disease, and soon everyone would be doing it.Everyone except for Y. T.  She couldn't seem to get the hang of it.It just seemed embarrassingly stupid to her.So she just faked it.Three times a day, they had a chance to eat and eliminate.It always happened in Burbclaves.Y. T.  could feel them pulling off the interstate, finding their way down twisty development lanes, courts, ways, and circles.A garage door would rise electrically, the van would pull in, the door would shut behind them.They would go into a suburban house, except stripped of furniture and other family touches, and sit on the floor in empty bedroomsone for boys, one for girlsand eat cake and cookies.This always happened in a totally empty room in a house, but there was always different decor: in one place, flowery countryish wallpaper and a lingering smell of rancid Glade.In another, bluish wallpaper featuring hockey players, football players, basketball players.In another, just plain white walls with old crayon marks on them.Sitting in these empty rooms, Y. T.  would study the old furniture scrapes on the floors, the dents in the sheetrock, and muse over them like an archaeologist, wondering about the long departed families who had once lived here.But toward the end of the ride, she wasn't paying attention anymore.In the van, she could hear nothing but singing and chanting, see nothing but the jammed together faces of her companions.When they stopped for gas, they did it in giant truck stops out in the middle of nowhere, pulling up to the most distant pump island so that no one was near them.And they never stopped driving.They just got relayed from one driver to the next.Finally, they got to a coast.Y. T.  could smell it.They spent a few minutes waiting, engine idling, and then the van bumped over some kind of a threshold, climbed a few ramps, stopped, set its parking brake.The driver got out and left them all alone in the van for the first time.Y. T.  felt glad that the trip was over.Then everything started to rumble, like an engine noise but a lot bigger.She didn't feel any movement until a few minutes later, when she realized that everything was rocking gently.The van was parked on a ship, and the ship was headed out to sea.It's a real ocean going ship.An old, shitty, rusty one that probably cost about five bucks at the ship junkyard.But it carries cars, and it goes through the water, and it doesn't sink.The ship is just like the van, except bigger, with more people.But they eat the same stuff, sing the same songs, and sleep just as rarely as ever.By now, Y. T.  finds it perversely comforting.She knows that she's with a lot of other people like her, and that she's safe.She knows the routine.She knows where she belongs.And so finally they come to the Raft.No one has told Y. T.  this is where they're going, but by now it's obvious.She ought to be scared.But they wouldn't be going to the Raft if it was as bad as everyone says.When it starts coming into view, she half expects them to converge on her with gaffer's tape again.But then she figures out it's not necessary.She hasn't been causing trouble.She's been accepted here, they trust her.It gives her a feeling of pride, in a way.And she won't cause trouble on the Raft because all she can do is escape from their part of it onto the Raft per se.As such.The real Raft.The Raft of a hundred Hong Kong B movies and blood soaked Nipponese comic books.It doesn't take much imagination to think of what happens to lone fifteen year old blond American girls on the Raft, and these people know it.Sometimes, she worries about her mother, then she hardens her heart and thinks maybe the whole thing will be good for her.Shake her up a little.Which is what she needs.After Dad left, she just folded up into herself like an origami bird thrown into a fire.There is kind of an outer cloud of small boats surrounding the Raft for a distance of a few miles.Almost all of them are fishing boats.Some of them carry men with guns, but they don't fuck around with this ferry.The ferry swings through this outer zone, making a broad turn, finally zeroing in on a white neighborhood on one flank of the Raft.Literally white.All the boats here are clean and new.There's a couple of big rusty boats with Russian lettering on the side, and the ferry pulls up alongside one of them, ropes are thrown across, then augmented with nets, gang planks, webs of old discarded tires.This Raft thing does not look like good skating territory at all.She wonders if any of the other people on board this ferry are skaters.Doesn't seem likely.Really, they are not her kind of people at all.She has always been a dirty scum dog of the highways, not one of these happy singalong types.Maybe the Raft is just the place for her.They take her down into one of the Russian ships and give her the grossest job of all time: cutting up fish.She does not want a job, has not asked for one.But that's what she gets.Still, no one really talks to her, no one bothers to explain anything, and that makes her reluctant to ask.She has just run into a massive cultural shock wave, because most of the people on this ship are old and fat and Russian and don't speak English.For a couple of days, she spends a lot of time sleeping on the job, being prodded awake by the hefty Russian dames who work in this place.She also does some eating.Some of the fish that comes through this place looks pretty rank, but there's a fair amount of salmon.The only way she knows this is from having sushi at the mallsalmon is the orange red stuff.So she makes some sushi of her own, munches down on some fresh salmon meat, and it's good.It clears her head a little.Once she gets over the shock of it and settles into a routine, she starts looking around her, watching the other fish cutting dames, and realizes that this is just like life must be for about 99 percent of the people in the world.You're in this place.There's other people all around you, but they don't understand you and you don't understand them, but people do a lot of pointless babbling anyway.In order to stay alive, you have to spend all day every day doing stupid meaningless work.And the only way to get out of it is to quit, cut loose, take a flyer, and go off into the wicked world, where you will be swallowed up and never heard from again.She's not especially good at cutting up fish.The big stout Russian chicksstomping, slab faced babushkaskeep giving her a hassle.They keep hovering, watching her cut with this look on their face like they can't believe what a dork she is.Then they try to show her how to do it the right way, but still she's not so good at it.It's hard, and her hands are cold and stiff all the time.After a couple of frustrating days, they give her a new job, farther down the production line: they turn her into a cafeteria dame.Like one of the slop slingers in the high school lunchroom.She works in the galley of one of the big Russian ships, hauling vats of cooked fish stew out to the buffet line, ladling it out into bowls, shoving it across the counter at an unending line consisting of religious fanatics, religious fanatics, and more religious fanatics.Except this time around, there seem to be a lot more Asians and hardly any Americans at all.They have a new species here too: people with antennas coming out of their heads.The antennas look like the ones on cop walkie talkies: short, blunt, black rubber whips.They rise up from behind the ear.The first time she sees one of these people, she figures it must be some kind of new Walkman, and she wants to ask the guy where he got it, what he's listening to.But he's a strange guy, stranger than all of the others, with a permanent thousand yard stare and a bad case of the mumbles, and he ends up giving her the creeps so bad that she just shoves an extra large dose of stew in his face and hurries him on down the line.From time to time, she actually recognizes one of the people who were in her van.But they don't seem to recognize her; they just look right through her.Glassy eyed.Like they've been brainwashed.Like Y. T.  was brainwashed.She can't believe it has taken her this long to figure out what they were doing to her.And that just makes her more pissed.44  In Reality, Port Sherman is a surprisingly tiny little burg, really just a few square blocks.Until the Raft came along, it had a full time population of a couple of thousand people.Now the population must be pushing fifty thousand.Hiro has to slow down a little bit here because the Refus are all sleeping on the street for the time being, an impediment to traffic.That's okay, it saves his life.Because shortly after he gets into Port Sherman, the wheels on his motorcycle lock upthe spokes become rigidand the ride gets very bumpy.A couple of seconds after that, the entire bike goes dead, becomes an inert chunk of metal.Not even the engine works.He looks down into the flat screen on top of the fuel tank, wanting to get a status report, but it's just showing snow.The bios has crashed.Asherah's possessed his bike.So he abandons it in the middle of the street, starts walking toward the waterfront.Behind him, he can hear the Refus waking up, struggling out of their blankets and sleeping bags, converging over the fallen bike, trying to be the first to claim it.He can hear a deep thumping in his chest, and for a minute he remembers Raven's motorcycle in L. A. , how he felt it first and heard it later.But there are no motorcycles around here.The sound is coming from above.It's a chopper.The kind that flies.Hiro can smell the seaweed rotting on the beach, he's so close.He comes around a corner and finds himself on the waterfront street, looking straight into the facade of the Spectrum 2000.On the other side is water.The chopper's coming up the fjord, following it inland from the open sea, headed straight for the Spectrum 2000.It's a small one, an agile number with a lot of glass.Hiro can see the crosses painted all over it where the red stars used to be.It is brilliant and dazzling in the cool blue light of early morning because it's shedding a trail of stars, blue white magnesium flares tumbling out of it every few seconds, landing in the water below, where they continue to burn, leaving an astral pathway marked out down the length of the harbor.They aren't there to look cool.They are there to confuse heat seeking missiles.From where he's standing, he can't see the roof of the hotel, because he's looking straight up at it.But he has the feeling that Gurov must be waiting there, on top of the tallest building in Port Sherman, waiting for a dawn evacuation to carry him away into the porcelain sky, carry him away to the Raft.Question: Why is he being evacuated?And why are they worried about heat seeking missiles?Hiro realizes, belatedly, that some heavy shit is going on.If he still had the bike, he could ride it right up the fire stairs and find out what's happening.But he doesn't have the bike.A deep thump sounds from the roof of a building on his right.It's an old building, one of the original pioneer structures from a hundred years ago.Hiro's knees buckle, his mouth comes open, shoulders hunch involuntarily, he looks toward the sound.And something catches his eye, something small and dark, darting away from the building and up into the air like a sparrow.But when it's a hundred yards out over the water, the sparrow catches fire, coughs out a great cloud of sticky yellow smoke, turns into a white fireball, and springs forward.It keeps getting faster and faster, tearing down the center of the harbor, until it passes all the way through the little chopper, in through the windshield and out the back.The chopper turns into a cloud of flame shedding dark bits of scrap metal, like a phoenix breaking out of its shell.Apparently, Hiro's not the only guy in town who hates Gurov.Now Gurov has to come downstairs and get on a boat.The lobby of the Spectrum 2000 is an armed camp, full of beards with guns.They're still putting their defense together; more soldiers are dragging themselves out of their coin lockers, pulling on their jackets, grabbing their guns.A swarthy guy, probably a Tatar sergeant left over from the Red Army, is running around the lobby in a modified Soviet Marines uniform, screaming at people, shoving them this way and that.Gurov may be a holy man, but he can't walk on water.He'll have to come out to the waterfront street, make his way two blocks down to the gate that admits him to the secured pier, and get on board the Kodiak Queen, which is waiting for him, black smoke starting to cough out of its stacks, lights starting to come on.Just down the pier from the Kodiak Queen is the Kowloon, which is the big Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong boat.Hiro turns his back on the Spectrum 2000 and starts running up and down the waterfront streets, scanning the logos until he sees the one he wants: Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.They don't want to let him in.He flashes his passport; the doors open.The guard is Chinese but speaks a bit of English.This is a measure of how weird things are in Port Sherman: they have a guard on the door.Usually, Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong is an open country, always looking for new citizens, even if they are the poorest Refus.Sorry, the guard says in a reedy, insincere voice, I did not know He points to Hiro's passport.The franchulate is literally a breath of fresh air.It doesn't have that Third World ambience, doesn't smell like urine at all.Which means it must be the local headquarters, or close to it, because most of Hong Kong's Port Sherman real estate probably consists of nothing more than a gunman hogging a pay phone in a lobby.But this place is spacious, clean, and nice.A few hundred Refus stare at him through the windows, held at bay not by the mere plate glass but by the eloquent promise of the three Rat Thing hutches lined up against one wall.From the looks of it, two of those have just been moved in recently.Pays to beef up your security when the Raft is coming through.Hiro proceeds to the counter.A man is talking on the phone in Cantonese, which means that he is, in fact, shouting.Hiro recognizes him as the Port Sherman proconsul.He is deeply involved in this little chat, but he has definitely noticed Hiro's swords, is watching him carefully.We are very busy, the man says, hanging up.Now you are a lot busier, Hiro says.I would like to charter your boat, the Kowloon.It's very expensive, the man says.I just threw away a brand new top of the line motorcycle in the middle of the street because I didn't feel like pushing it half a block to the garage, Hiro says.I am on an expense account that would blow your mind.It's broken.I appreciate your politeness in not wanting to come out and just say no, Hiro says, but I happen to know that it is, in fact, not broken, and so I must consider your refusal equivalent to a no.It's not available, the man says.Someone else is using it.It has not yet left the pier, Hiro says, so you can cancel that engagement, using one of the excuses you have just given me, and then I will pay you more money.We cannot do this, the man says.Then I will go out into the street and inform the Refus that the Kowloon is leaving for L. A.  in exactly one hour, and that they have enough room to take twenty Refus along with them, first come, first served, Hiro says.No, the man says.I will tell them to contact you personally.Where do you want to go on the Kowloon?the man says.The Raft.Oh, well, why didn't you say so, the man says.That's where our other passenger is going.You've got someone else who wants to go to the Raft?That's what I said.Your passport, please.Hiro hands it over.The man shoves it into a slot.Hiro's name, personal data, and mug shots are digitally transferred into the franchulate's bios, and with a little bit of key pounding, the man persuades it to spit out a laminated photo ID card.You get onto the pier with this, he says.It's good for six hours.
