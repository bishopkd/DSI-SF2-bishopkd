She realized that in her current state of mind she was a liability to the cause.Earth the bad planet.Despite its wind and its sky, she was coming to hate it again, and not just because of the awful g but rather because of the evidence everywhere of what her species had done to the place, and was still doing.The dead hand of the past, so huge, so heavy.The air seemed a syrup she had to struggle through.Out in the terraria one lived free, like an animalone could be an animal, make ones own life one way or another.Live as naked as you wanted.On the God damned Earth the accumulated traditions and laws and habits made something that was worse than any body bra; it was ones mind that was held in place, tied in straitjackets, obliged to be like all the others in their ridiculous boxed habits.Here they were, on the only planetary surface on which you could walk freely, naked to the wind and the sun, and when they had a choice, they sat in boxes and stared at littler boxes, just as if they had no choiceas if they were in a space stationas if the bad old days of the caged centuries had never gone away.They didnt even look up at the stars at night.Walking among them, she saw that it was so.Indeed if they had been people who were interested in the stars they would not have still been here.There overhead stood Orion at his angle, the most beautiful object any of us will ever know in the world, spread out on the sky like a true god, in whom it would only be necessary to believe a little.But no one looked.Despite her discontent, another North Harare shantytown near Dzivarasekwa had agreed to work with her and her team.The shantytown was banked on the side of a steep ridge, and the people there were squatters, with the ridge near enough to the borders of New Zimbabwe and Rhodesia to make for confusion about sovereignty.A good prospect, therefore, in political terms, but the steepness of the ridge was a problem for the selfreps.Swans team had designed a platting for the process that had the hangars moving in a warp and weft pattern, with some following contour intervals, while others climbed straight up slopes using telescoping pillar jacks to keep the factories horizontal.In this manner they were managing to transform the swath of their passage into a stylish white village with some touches of color; it would be quite beautiful.But one morning one of their hangars suddenly veered downhill from the ridge, chomping through first a park and then the leafy suburb Kuwadzana.The locally trained minders of the selfrep had given up trying to control the thing and had jumped off ladders on its sides into the arms of a growing crowd.When Swan arrived on the scene, she shouted and shoved her way through the crowd, then leaped onto the bottom of the hangar ladder; even when out of control, the behemoth was crunching along at only about a kilometer an hour.Up the ladder she climbed, then slipped through a door into the control room, like a tugboats bridge.It was empty.She went to the back wall and smashed down the override switch with her fists.Nothing happened; the leviathan ground on over the streets and homes of the suburb, with a rumble like a muffled Niagara Falls coming from its hidden underside.Now she began to understand why the local minders had abandoned ship.With the override not working, there wasnt anything else obvious that one could do.Swan sat down before the operation console and began to type at speed, while also commanding it verbally to stop.She was first calm, then demanding, then persuasive, then pleading, finally shouting in a fury.The selfrep AI neither responded nor stopped the hangar moving.Something in it must have been jammed; that couldnt have been easy, a matter of clever industrial sabotage, fighting through some tough security.Swan thought she knew some relevant codes, but nothing she tried was working.What the hell!she said.Why is so much tech support out of reach?There are other attacks now ongoing, possibly timed with this one, Pauline informed her.So can you give me any help here?Pauline said, Type in the sentence Fog is thick in Lisbon.Swan did this, and then Pauline said, Now you can drive the unit manually.There are four controls on the panel  I know how to drive the damn thing!Swan said.Shut up!So therefore you can now apply the brakes.Swan cursed her qube and then, without ceasing to curse, turned the hangar in a tight half circle (meaning it took a few hundred meters) back up the hill, but now crunching over streets lined with prosperous villas.I wish this thing worked backwards, she said furiously.I wish we could give these rich bastards here the hovels they deserve.Possibly it would be better just to stop, Pauline noted.Shut up!Swan let the hangar crunch over the neighborhood for a while longer before bringing it to a halt.So this thing was sabotaged, she said.Yes.Damn it.And now were going to get arrested.Very likely, Pauline said.It followed as Swan had predicted.The local government demanded that the damaged selfrep be impounded and its operators arrested, prosecuted, and deported or imprisoned.Swan was taken into custody and held in a set of rooms in the government house; it was not a jail, but she could not leave, and it seemed possible that she would be sentenced to time in prison.At that possibility she began to spiral down into a furious despair.We were invited here, she kept insisting to her keepers.We were only trying to help.The sabotage was not our fault!None of her keepers appeared to be listening to her.One spoke ominously of a sentence designed to shut her up for good.Into this nightmare Wahram suddenly appeared, accompanied by an African League officer, a short slight man from Gabon named Pierre, who spoke beautiful French and a much more rudimentary English.He said, You are released to your colleague here, but must leave North Harare.The construction machines will be taken over by locals.Locals only must run them.So.He held out a hand as if pointing her to the exit.Swan, surprised, almost refused on principle to agree.Then she saw Wahrams eyebrows shoot up and his eyes go round; his dismay reminded her of how much her situation had been frightening her, and after a moment more she humbly agreed with Pierres conditions and followed Wahram out to a car, which drove them to an airfield where a big dirigible was tethered to a tall mast.Lets get out while the gettings good, Wahram suggested.Yeah yeah, Swan said.The dirigible was as long as an oil tanker, one of a big fleet of similar craft that were constantly circling the Earth from west to east, tugged by kites that were cast up into the jet stream, delivering freight slowly but surely as they circumnavigated the globe time after time.This particular dirigible had a balloon shaped like a cigar, and the gondola under it was lined with windows stacked four and five high.Wahram led her into the mast elevator and they rose to the loading platform.Inside the dirigible they walked a long hall to the bow, where there was a viewing deck somewhat like the bubble at the fore end of a terrarium.Wahram had reserved two chairs and a table there for later in the day, after they had launched and hummed up to altitude.So that afternoon when they sat at their table, they could look down at the green hills of Earth, passing below in a stately parade.It was beautiful, but Swan was not looking.Thank you, Swan said stiffly.I was in serious trouble there.Wahram shrugged.Happy to help.He talked about the work in North America, the problems there and elsewhere.Much of it Swan had not heard about yet, but the pattern was depressingly clear.Nothing new to learn here: the Earth was fucked.Wahram had come to a more measured conclusion, as was his way.Ive been thinking that our first wave of help has been too too blunt, for lack of a better word.Too focused on the built environment, and on housing in particular.Maybe people like to feel theyve had a hand in building their homes.I dont think people care who builds it, Swan said.Well, but in space we do.Why not here?Because when your home can fall apart and kill you and your kids just because it rains, then youre happy to see a machine replace it with something better!You dont worry about feelings until your material needs are met.You know that.The hierarchy of needs is a real thing.But granting that, Wahram said, which I do, there have still been a lot of complaints about our efforts.And there is no denying that the project is getting snarled.Its like Gulliver tied down by strings.Thats not a good image, Swan said, thinking of the talls and smalls in the sexliner.A lot of opposition is disguised to look like it comes from the people, but really its the usual reactionary obstructionism.We have to break those strings if they try to wrap us!It seems to me that the image is somewhat apt, Wahram said mildly.The lines holding Gulliver down are laws, and that makes them important.But look, theres a way around the lines.We can slip through.The work weve been doing in Canada has been very suggestive.Their tea tray arrived, and he poured her a cup, which she promptly forgot.He sipped his slowly, watching the Indian Ocean appear, and then in the distance to the south a rumpled green island: Madagascar, one of the most completely devastated ecosystems in history, now a model of Ascension type hybridization.One of the biggest islands on Earth, now completely a work of landscape art, and thriving.People went there to see its gardens and forests.Wahram gestured at it.Landscape restoration is going on all over, as people try to cope with the changes.And its very labor intensive, and very tied to place.You cant do it from somewhere else.You cant take advantage of differential currencies.You cant really extract a profit from it.So its already well situated in terms of our purposes.Its a public good and it needs to be done.All the coastlines need it.Its hard to believe how much needs to be done.It isnt even restoration exactly, because the old coastlines are gone for good, or for hundreds of years.Its actually creating new coastlines at the higher sea level.Right now theyre raw.The ocean rips up what it inundates, and a lot of toxic stuff gets released.The new shoreline and tidal zone is usually a disaster.Fixing all that is very labor intensive.And yet everyone living on the new coasts wants to see it done.Many want to do it themselves.So, what Ive been involved with in Florida is a bit of an unusual case, because it looks like restoration, but really its creation from scratch.Another kind of terraforming.It only resembles restoration because Florida used to be there.Actually you could do the same thing in shallow water anywhere.It might not even take moving mountains into the sea.There are fast corals now that could be used as foundation builders.Bioceramics expressed more broadly.Ive seen groups using these corals, and they can grow them fast at many of the new coastlines, and pretty soon you get wonderful pure white sand, very fine.It squeaks when you walk on it.Swan shrugged.All right, sure.But Im still not willing to stop working directly on housing.I know.He watched the land below.Seemed like he might even sleep.After a few minutes he stirred and began to say something, but hesitated.Swan saw this and said, What?Tell me.Theres something else, he said, glancing at her almost as if shyly.Ive been thinking that one of the things weve been doing here is providing more evidence that reform inside the paradigm of the current system on Earth is never going to be enough.That there is still, in other words, the necessity for revolution.But thats what Ive been saying!Thats what I said to you on Venus!I know.So now Im coming to agree.So you remember the project I told you about that Alex was leading, the stocking up of animals in the terraria, so we could bring them back to Earth?Yes, of course.She wanted there to be enough animals to resupply Earth when the right time came.Right.And so Ive been wondering if the time has come.Swan was startled.You mean the time to bring the animals back?A feeling filled her then that she couldnt name: oceans of clouds, roiling inside her chest, building to some kind of thunderhead.Do you think so?What do you mean?He lifted his gaze from Madagascar and looked at her.He had a goofy little grin, brief and crooked, a toads grin, and yet warm.Yes.Lists (13)  Bats.Sloths.Tarsiers and tapirs.Elephants and

together, first in big landers protected by heat shields, then in smaller landers popping parachutes, then in exfoliating balloon bags.At that point they were drifting down through the airspace the Inuit nations had given them permission to cross.When they got within a few hundred meters of the ground, every lander disintegrated into thousands of aerogel bubbles drifting down, each transparent bubble a smart balloon holding inside it an animal or animal family.What the animals thought of it was anyones guess: some were struggling in their aerogel, others looked around as placid as clouds.The west wind had its effect, and the bubbles drifted east like seed pods.Swan looked around, trying to see everywhere at once: sky all strewn with clear seeds, which from any distance were visible only as their contents, so that she drifted eastward and down with thousands of flying wolves, bears, reindeer, mountain lions.There she saw a fox pair; a clutch of rabbits; a bobcat or lynx; a bundle of lemmings; a heron, flying hard inside its bubble.It looked like a dream, but she knew it was real, and the same right now all over Earth: into the seas splashed dolphins and whales, tuna and sharks.Mammals, birds, fish, reptiles, amphibians: all the lost creatures were in the sky at once, in every country, every watershed.Many of the creatures descending had been absent from Earth for two or three centuries.Now all back, all at once.Swan came down in the midst of a cluster of animals.They were somewhere in the new wheat belt of southern Nunavut, Our Land.Her particular landing point was supposed to be a low rise in the midst of a district covered by wheat and cold rice farms.Every field was marred by a few pingos, small hills like boils, raised when big chunks of ice floated up through the mud of the melting permafrost.As she made her final approach, which hill was hers was hard to tell.The descent was handled entirely by her bubble, and as she had never landed in one before, she enjoyed the feeling of itas if a transparent magic carpet were lowering her.All around her the animals in the air were becoming aware of the ground, some struggling, some hunched, many with their legs splayed out like falling cats or flying squirrels, in just the right way even though it was their first ever fallsome kind of conserved lizard behavior, perhaps, shared by all.She herself landed so neatly that it was as if stepping off an escalator.Touching the ground popped the balloon, and its aerogel blew away.And there she was, standing on the ground, on a pingo in Nunavut.There were three other people in her observation team, coming down as close to each other as the wind would allow.She looked up to see if she could spot them, and the sight of the sky above almost caused her to fall on her butt; she cried out, she laughed: the sky was still full of animals.Descending out of the western sky, dropping from low cumulus clouds, were caribou and elk and grizzly bears, all big brown dots with splayed legs.All the other animals too, many in clusters, the higher ones too small to see what they were.Around her the dense wheat was shivering with the movement of creatures freed of their burst bubbles and running for cover.One could in fact land right on her; she had to keep an eye out.She laughed to think of it, she threw her arms out and howled to the wolves in the sky.In the distance other wolves were barking.There were also hoots and bellows, many sounding fearful, but it was hard to say; that was just an assumption; in fact she couldnt be sure these sounds were not triumphant.Home at last!All Gods children are home at last, she proclaimed over her radio.The other humans were checking in; they had landed.The cool west wind blew through her and she howled some more.The last of their wave floated down; then the clouds above were all by themselves again.Only a few last black dots drifted in the distance, light as down.All together it was the most beautiful thing she had ever seen.All right, she said with her radio off.I love you.You have done a great thing.Whether she was talking to Alex, or Wahram, or the world, she couldnt say.So here she was, on the taiga between boreal forest and tundra.There would be caribou and grizzly bears here now, and mountain lions; every biome needed its top predators for the whole system to thrive.The grizzly bears would immediately take to the hills; mountain lions would likewise disappear on landing.But the wolves would find each other and band together, and thus stay visible in their packs; and Swan wanted to be there for that.All her life she had followed them in terraria, hunted with them, chased them off kills, slept curled at the edge of the pack, next to the nursing mamas.She had howled with them more times than she could have counted; every time she heard them howl she joined in, feeling it was the human thing to do.Other times she had felt the long stare on her, and had stared back.She had seen wolves in discourse with coyotes, seen ravens lead them to a target kill for a share of the leavings.She knew that humans had made wolves more human, and thus dogs, and in that same time period wolves had made humans more wolfish, by teaching them pack behaviors.None of the other primates had friends that were not kin, for instance; humans had learned that from watching wolves.The two species had at different times scavenged each others food; they had learned each others hunting methods; they had, in short, coevolved.Now the primates were bringing back the other half of the family.And so here she was.Her team of four was to check for animals not properly freed from their bubbles, to free them when found or help them if injured.This was not supposed to have happened very frequently, but the ground here was hummocky, with both pingos and depressions called kettles, which formed when the ice core of pingos melted away.Kettles were round and steep sided, and often filled with water to the water table, only a meter or two underground in many areas.Wheat and a bioengineered cold rice had been attempted here, as on the tundra and taiga all around the north, as a climate change adaptation, but the attempt had proved to be more difficult than imagined.So in the resulting mess of a landscape, bad landfalls seemed quite possible.As it turned out, the bubbles worked so well that Swan and her teammates did not see any animals in distress.They were all moving, however; some were even running in a panic.But soon the panicked ones would tire, stop, look around.Hopefully see a landscape not too unfamiliar.Most of the terraria had been kept at one g for precisely this moment, and had been designed to resemble the places the animals now returned to.Caribou stood so tall that they found each other easily.The smaller animals slipped away in the wheat, headed for the hills to the west, or the little trees of the boreal forest visible on the horizons to the south.No creature was visibly in need of aid.All were on the land, confronting their new fate.Every animal had been tagged, and now they were showing up on screens as patterns of colored dots, so Swans team proceeded to the next part of their plan, which was to follow the caribou, and if necessary chivvy them along, a bit like sheepdogs with sheep, on a course that would lead them east to the Thelon River.This new herds first migration would be instinctive but aimlessunless they picked up old traces of the lost Beverly, Bathurst, and Ahiak herdsso whichever way they took now would begin to establish the smells and other signs of a new migration route.This would then become a de facto habitat corridor through the new wheat zone, a corridor that would perhaps need to be defended in the relevant courts, but they could cross that bridge when they came to it; first the caribou had to cross the river.This leading of animal migrations across agricultural land was the biggest organized act of civil disobedience ever committed by spacers on Earth, but the hope was that after being escorted the first time, the animals would manage on their own, and become popular with the indigenous humans, even the farmers, who were not having that much success anyway.So the escorts might get arrested before they were done, but hopefully the habitat corridors would be quickly recognized as values worth the land given over to them.As usual when walking with a group of people, Swan quickly fell behind.There was too much to look at; things were so interesting that she forgot what her task was, even now.The plans and research devoted to the possible rewilding of Earth had been going on for a century, and here she was part of it, and still she stumbled around looking at flowers poking out from rocky soil here and there, velvet pads of astonishing color.Above them stood a tall pale blue sky, with a line of cumulus scudding east.She still saw in her mind animals floating down like seeds in the sun; the sight had cast her into a dream and she had not emerged from it, and so naturally she had to go slow.She was in radio contact with her partners anyway.In fact their chatter in her ear was worse than Pauline, and she turned the volume to zero.Shed check in when she needed to.For now she wanted to get her focus back to the ground under her feet.In the previous years work in Africa she had come to take things for granted; she had forgotten where she was, simple as that.She had fallen inside her problem while all the world flew on a big wind through the sky.Now this open land, this taiga.On the south face of the next rise, a straggle of dwarfed pines.A drunken forest, the permafrost under it melting.Low hills to the east under the line of clouds.Sky immensely tall, the blue a bit pastel above the low clouds still trundling east.The air seemed to smell slightly of fire.High afternoon sun, August 5, 2312.A new day.Warm, but not hot.A bit muggy and buggy.She was in a bodysuit that kept her dry, and very effectively repelled mosquitoes and flies, which was a good thing, because they hovered in dense black clouds that here and there looked like swirling smoke.She couldnt see any of her team; the long up and down of the land here was chopped by low ridges, old eskers perhaps.In any case she had limited viewing east.She climbed up the side of a pingo and had a look around.Ah, there was Chris, just a couple hundred meters ahead, appearing to wave to someone even farther east.Good for them.Spongy grass and moss of the taiga filled every low point.Only a meter higher were long mounds of flattened bedrock that crossed the bog north to south.It would have been best to stay on these natural roads, but her team had gone east, following the herding caribou.She went north, heading for a point of high ground marked by krummholz trees waist high to her.She reached this prominence and stopped at the sight of a wolf pack on the other side.They had just landed, and were running around sniffing and nipping at each other, stopping short on occasion to howl and then run on again.They were amped up by the descent, no doubt about it.She knew just how they felt.It took them a while to pull themselves together and lope off to the east.They were gray with black or beige points and shag, and were looking svelte in their short summer coats.More broad shouldered and square headed than most dogs, they were still very similar in lots of ways.Wild dogs, self organized: it was always kind of a disturbing thought.That they had turned out so well, so decent and playful, was a bit surprising to Swan, and reminded her that the wolves had come first and were wiser than dogs.Now Swan was put to it to keep up with them, huffing and puffing fairly soon after she started her pursuit.No human could keep up with wolves running hard, but if you kept at it, they often stopped to have a look and sniff around, and then it was possible to keep them in sight, or catch up and relocate them again.A male howled and others replied, Swan among them.She would have to run a little bit harder if she wanted to stay part of it.That would be hard.She stayed in better shape off Earth than on, a small irony that was now making her grimace and resolve to do better.These wolves were nine in number.They were big ones, with more streaks of black than white.Their fur bounced on them like hair as they ran.Their wolfish lope ate up ground, though it resembled a canter.Seeing them run, Swan howled to herself, oceans in her chest: they were free on Earth.That happiness could be so deep it hurt; another lesson in learning the world.Ahead the pingos and kettles smoothed away, and a sheet of wheat covered the land.The wolves had hesitated at this sight, and Swan was able to slip around them to the south, behind the easternmost of the pingos.The wheat field beyond had been smoothed by laser to a plain tilting to the east about five meters in every kilometer.Flat land indeedunrealan artifact.A work of art, in its way.But soon to be reconfigured.Eight kilometers to the east another pingo outbreak was just visible, and another scrap of undeveloped taigaundrained, too boggy to farm, more lake than land.Swan pulled her wolf skina big old males skin, with head and paws still attachedout of her suits backpack.She draped it over her head so that it flowed down her back like a cape.She had clipped gold rings through the tips of its ears.Now she circled ahead of the pack, howled back at them.Then she ran as hard as she could to the east.She was chest deep in wheat, and could run between rows of it.Ahead to the east her colleagues were leading a herd of caribou by way of scent and cast off antlers.The wheat had taken a beating where the herd had passed.She saw that they were following the shallow streambed of a creek almost erased by the laser flat plowing.The half buried streambed was still muddy, and her teammates were leading the herd away from that, paralleling it to the south.The scent of wolves would reach them soon, and then it would be no problem to keep them headed east, over low rise after low rise.They would go wherever seemed most distant from wolves, at least for a while.Eventually the two species would come to a predator/prey accommodation, but for now the big prey animals were no doubt still spooked, and prone to stampede.She saw signs of what she thought had been a small panic, and the bodies of several calves lay trampled in the middle of this zone.Swan turned to face the wolves now following her.She stood on a high point with the wolfs head draped over hers and howled a warning.The pack stopped and stared at her, ears pointed and fur erectthey too were spooked.Their look now was not their famous long stare, Swan judged, but a real attempt to see better.Still, they were on the hunt, and so after a while, on they came.Swan gave way, turned, retreated at speed.She had given the caribou some extra time to get past the little swale, so now she got out of the way as quickly as she could.From the north she chivvied the wolves from time to time over the next few hours, but for the most part she could barely keep up with them, and in the end could only follow sign.For a long time it was a slog through wheat following the caribou tracks.Once, she saw a line of giant red harvesters on the southern skyline.That night most of the caribou were ahead of her and had formed a herd and were headed east.They were primed for migration, inclined to move.Then also the wolves and people and other predators were like beaters on a hunt, the people involved sometimes using sirens and scents and, as always, their own very disturbing presence.People were the top predator, even when wolves and lions and bears were aroundas long as they stayed in packs, as wolves had taught them so long beforeand had their tools in hand, in case push ever came to shove.Swan, stumbling along at the end of a very long day, began to feel the spirit of the pursuit fill her and lift her up like a body bra.She was Diana on the hunt, it was what they did as animals.She had done this so often inside terraria that it was hard to believe she was out at last, but there was the sky over them, and the wind keening past.If the line of caribou migration was to be established for good, and the entire zone made into a habitat corridor, then the land itself would have to be changed, as it had been before.Again humans would be altering it.All Earth was a park now, a work of art, shaped by artists.This new alteration was just one more stroke of the brush.The transformation of taiga into cropland had been a matter of shaving down high points and filling up low points, with the growth of new topsoil hastened by engineered bacteria.Thus it was pretty flat now, as if a sea surface with a slight groundswell.But with the freeze thaw cycle and the permafrost melt, things had been unflattening.The passage of the caribou was enough to tear up the topsoil; where they had passed, it looked like a phalanx of tractors hauling spikes had churned through the wheat.Swan avoided their track for that reason, except for brief excursions into the muck to bury transponder beacons, and also to mark the soil with scents, and herbicides aimed at wheat.They were also seeding boreal forest.In some places they were blowing up the land, tossing the blankets of introduced soil aside to bring the original taiga bacteria back to the surface.All this had to be done while the caribou were far enough away that they were not scared from coming back; but there was a lot to do, so they were starting as soon as they could.She slept those nights in her bodysuit, which had an aerogel mattress and blanket in its pockets to keep her warm, and enough food for a few days.Once or twice she checked in with her team, but she preferred to be by herself, unwolfish though that was, to track the wolves.She seldom had the pack in sight now, but she could track them by sign; the ground was soft, the paw prints of the nine frequent.Her own Group of Nine.On the third morning, well before dawn, after a night of little sleep, she decided to rise and catch up to the pack if she could.In the dark and cold she hiked with a headlamp on, and saw the tracks on the ground best when she took the light off her head and held it near the ground and pointing forward.About an hour before dawn she heard their howls ahead.It was their dawn chorus.Wolves howled at the sight of Venus rising, knowing the sun would come soon after.Swan saw what they were howling at, but by its relation to Orion knew it was not Venus, but Sirius.The wolves had been fooled yet again; the Pawnee had even named Sirius He Who Fools the Wolves for this very mistake.When Venus itself rose, about half an hour later, only one uneasy lupine astronomer spoke up again to howl that something was wrong.Swan laughed to hear it.Now other wolves farther to the west would be taking up the dawn howl.For a long time when dawn crossed North America, there had been a terminator zone of howling wolves running the length of the whole continent, moving west with the day.Now that might come back.When it was light, she worked her way closer to them by tracking that uneasy astronomer.The wolves had apparently stayed on a pingo that night, and they yipped and barked gruffly as she approached; they didnt want to leave, and they didnt want her to get any nearer.Something was going on up there, she thought; one of them giving birth or something like that.She waited for them at a distance, and only when they had slunk off to the east did she climb the soft side of the pingo to check it out.A sound stopped her cold; she saw nothing at first, but there was a little pond at the very top of the pingo, a kettle like the caldera of a miniature volcano.Noise from therea whiningshe walked up to the edge of it to look down.A young wolf, fur wet and muddy, was slinking along a narrow edge of clay rimming the water three or four meters below.Walls of the hole were vertical, even hollowed out and eaten back by the water at the bottom, which had a tint of turquoise in its muddy blue, as if it might be floored by the ice at the pingos core.The wolf pawed at the lined clay.A young male wolf.He looked up at her and she half extended a hand toward him, and with that the ground under her gave way, and despite her twist and leap she fell into the pond with a load of mud.The wolf barked once and cringed away from her.She swam; she had not hit the bottom of the pond, despite plunging deeply in when she fell.She swam to the other side of the wall and climbed out onto a narrow ring of exposed mud, which went all the way around.It was like being inside a vase.Her fall hole had created a spout for it.Swan avoided looking at the wolf.She whistled and cooed like a dove, then a nightingale.She had never seen a wolf eating a bird of any kind, but just so he didnt get any ideas, she added a short hawks cry.He was still trying to climb out; he was afraid of her.He fell back as the wet overhanging mud gave under his forepaws.He hit the water upside down and Swan reached out instinctively to help, but of course he was perfectly capable of twisting around and swimming back to the band of clay, and when he felt her touch he whipped around and bit her right hand, then swam desperately away.She shouted in pain and surprise.Her blood was in the water, in his mouth.The bite burned, and there was one puncture in the back of the hand that was going to well blood for a long time.Her bodysuit, which was keeping everything but her head dry, had a first aid kit in its thigh pocket.She pulled it out and considered whether skin glue would work on a puncture wound.Well, it had to be tried.She punctured the tube and poured a lot of the glue into the dark red hole, then held a gauze pad to it hard.The gauze would be glued into the hole, but she could cut the excess away and leave the rest in there, and it would be all right.The inner wall of the kettle was smooth except for some horizontal banding.How exactly was she going to get out?She reached into her pocket for her mobile, found that the pocket was empty.The pocket had been open, as she had been calling her colleagues pretty frequently.Well, they would notice her absence and GPS her.Possibly she could dive down to the bottom of the pond and recover the mobile, and possibly it would still be working after being submerged.Actually neither of these seemed very likely.Pauline, can you locate my mobile?No.Can you contact my team for me?No.I am designed to be in contact with you alone, by way of a short range airport function.No radio?No long range radio transmitter, as you know.As I should know.You useless piece of crap.The wolf was growling, and Swan shut up.Briefly she cawed.Hawk!she cawed, thinking the young wolf might give her some space as a creature that spoke the crow language.She didnt know what to do, really.Pauline, how can I get out of here?I dont know.This, coming without even a slight delay, sounded faintly disapproving.Swan moved around the circumferential band of mud, and the wolf moved with her to stay across the pond.If the higher ledges on this side held under her weight, then she might be able to climb out.She tested it, glancing at the wolf as she did.He was facing her but looking a bit to the side.It was quickly obvious that the mud of the wall was not going to hold her up.She needed sticks to carve steps, or to stick into the mud far enough to give her a hold.But the kettle had no sticks in it.Again she wondered about finding things at the bottom of the pond.But the water was frigid, and her bodysuit did not cover her head.And there was no way of telling how far down the bottom was, and whether there was anything down there anyway.Pauline, Im afraid were stuck here.Yes.Extracts (16)  It was never the official policy of any unit larger than the individual terrarium, and even those would seldom say anything explicit about their animalswhere they were sending them, how many, by what transport, whynothing.The assumption is that the coordination that obviously had to have happened was all kept offline, and is still not properly documented.Looking back, such an absence of public statement does not seem so surprising, because we are used to it now; but at the time it was a relatively new phenomenon, and there were widespread complaints that the disappearance of public policy statements meant they lived in sheer chaos.No order obtained in the solar system, the balkanization was complete; the story of humanity had for a time disappeared like a stream of meltwater on the surface of a glacier, falling into a moulin and running thereafter invisibly under the ice.No one controlled it; no one knew where it was going; no one even knew what was happening  from the very beginning there were people who argued that it was wrong in many different ways: that it was an ecological disaster, that most of the animals would die; that the land would be devastated, botanical communities wrecked, people endangered, their agriculture ruined.The images of the animals return could resemble World War II parachute attacks or alien invasion movies, and the fear of similar casualty rates created trauma in several places.During the descent some animals were shot out of the sky like shooting range skeet.And yet on the whole down they came, landed, survived, endured.For a few weeks or months, therefore, it was all anyone spoke about, and all shouted at the tops of their lungs.And the massive flood of images was ambiguous, to say the least.Some cried invasion, but others cried reunion.Rewilding, assisted migration, the revolt of the beasts; and at some point it was called the reanimation, and that term got capitalized and gradually stuck and spread, superseding all the rest.And in the end it did not matter what name people gave it: the animals were there  many accused the terraria of fomenting revolution on Earth.Others called it an inoculation, and there were microbiologists who spoke of reverse transcription.The introduction of an inoculant into an empty ecological niche does indeed cause a revolution in the biome.Rapid change can be chaotic, traumatic.In this case animals did often die; their food was all eaten and then there were population crashes, scavengers did well, always predator and prey fluctuated wildly, and the plant life metamorphosed under their impact.Fields changed, forests changed, suburbs and cities changed.Eradication campaigns were met with fierce resistance and fierce support efforts.Sometimes it came to a kind of war of the animals, but people always led the charge on both sides  even in the moment of balkanization, Earth was central to history.An estimated twelve thousand terraria had been raising endangered animal populations for more than a century, strengthening genomic diversity as they did, and the whole point of the exercise had been to serve as a dispersed zoo or ark or inoculant bank, waiting for the right moment to reintroduce these creatures to their wounded home.That the moment had come struck some in the terraria as an overoptimistic assessment, but in the end almost all had agreed to heed the call, and they mounted a formidable armada  much of the organizational work for the reanimation was later traced to a working group associated with the seventh Lion of Mercury, who had died a few years previous to the event.Some Terran governments had been contacted, and those friendly to the idea had provided permits.Assisted migration was already a familiar concept, and invasive species had already rearranged the world anyway; people had struggled against the mass extinction without success, and much of Earth was now occupied by the toughest weeds and scavengers.There was talk of a coming world of seagulls and ants, cockroaches and crows, coyotes and rabbitsa star thistle world, depopulate and impoverisheda big broken factory farm.Reintroducing lost species was therefore welcome to many Terrans.That there would be inevitable political consequences was only to say it was a collective human action; those always have consequences  the twelve thousand terraria and a few score Terran states apparently agreed to execute the plan in the first half of 2312, but as most agreements were off the record, this is anecdotal only.For the most part the oral records of participants, made years later, are the only account  After the reanimation, problems on Earth became ecological and logistical, and focused on transport, dispersion, mitigation, compensation, and legal and physical defense.The reanimation itself was not the end of the story; indeed many decades were to pass before it was understood to have been a key moment in the eventual      WAHRAM AND SWAN  When Wahram heard that Swan had gone missing, he left Ottawa, where he had been in intense negotiations with the Canadian government over the unauthorized arrival of the animals, and flew north to Churchill, and just caught a night flight to Yellowknife, the staging area for the work on the habitat corridor that Swan had joined.A short summer night had passed by that point, and it was well past dawn on the following day when a helicopter took him over the land where Swans transponder had her.By the time they got there, her team had already located her; but it was good to have a helicopter there, because it was impossible to approach the edge of the pingo summit pond without joining her in it.One of her rescuers had already decisively proved that, so now she was down there with another person and, apparently, a wolf.At least they had it outnumbered now, though some in the helo were saying that made it worse.In any case, they could lower a flexible ladder with a harness from the helicopter, from quite a height, though still not high enough to keep from terrifying the wolfWahram could see that looking down on it from above.The other person came up the ladder first and was deposited at the foot of the pingo; then Swan; she was red eyed and looked wasted, but waved at Wahram, and by hand gestures indicated that they were to lower the ladder one more time.That the wolf would be able to use the ladder to escape, Wahram doubted; but the pilot lowered it anyway and, after a radioed consultation with the people below, flew slightly to the side, so that the ladder was draped against the wall.Even that seemed insufficient to Wahram, so he started in his seat when the wolf suddenly leaped once onto the ladder and again up to the rim and raced off down the hill.Wahram told the pilot he wanted to be dropped off, so she descended on the wheat field next to the pingo, beating out an impromptu crop circle with her downdraft.Wahram climbed out of the helo, with its big blades blurring the air over him, and ran crouching until he was well clear of the contraption, which then gnashed and thwacked back into the sky.Swan ran to him and gave him a muddy hug.When he got the earplugs out of his ears, he asked how she was.She was fine, she said; had had a great time, had shared her hole with a wolf, and neither was the worse for it, just as one knew would be the case, but it was always good to get empirical confirmation in moments like that when push came to shove and one could get eaten.She was a little manic, he saw.Dirty, she admitted, and hungry, and ready for a little break before getting back to the work.Wahram gestured at the helicopter, still chopping the air overhead, and when she agreed to the plan, he gestured for it to redescend, and they got in it.After that it was too loud to talk, and they waited until they got back to Yellowknife, her leaning against his shoulder and smiling as she slept right through the racket.It figured that as the animals had been dropped on ten thousand sites, they would get opposition in some places; at least so it seemed in advance, although no one was sure of anything.In any case they worked as if they had only a few days of freedom to do so, and used helicopters like hoppers to move around, setting loose robotic sun powered tractors, which hauled seeders that looked like the farming machinery one saw in photos from long before.Some of these planted trees two meters tall at a rate of sixty per hour until their supplies were exhausted.Thus the reanimation included a botanical element, and the tractors proved hard to stop.And few people tried.Still there were incidents, and in Yellowknife as they ate they checked the stories coming in from around the world.It was everything from hosannas to artillery fire: cheered or denounced, and everything in between, from every possible source, including the U. N.  Security Council, gathered in emergency session and yet at a loss.Orangutans back all over Southeast Asia, river dolphins in all their old river mouths, tigers in India and Siberia and Java, grizzly bears back in their old range in North America was this not the alien invasion feared for so many centuries, come at last?It was unpermitted; it was disruptive; the animals included carnivores that could kill people; it had to be bad.Certainly it was confusing.And power, confused, was always dangerous.But they also saw the Terran news noting that the animals were always landing in their original native habitats, shifted if necessary to adjust to climatic change since their disappearance.Also, that although they were not genetically modified organisms, an intense breeding effort in the terraria had created much more genetically diverse animals than the remnant Earthly populations.This was part of Wahrams publicity packet information, so he was particularly pleased to see the media pick that up.Also the reports were noting that animals had for the most part come down in wilderness preserves, and in areas of hills, deserts, pasturage, and other least human impacted spacesnever in cities, and only once or twice in villages.A Colombian village that suffered an aerial invasion of sloths and jaguars had already renamed itself Macondo, and clearly would live to tell the tale.For a while Swan slept on a couch in their impromptu conference center.Wahram found he was not comfortable letting her out of his sight.She was still acting very affectionately toward him, cast into some kind of ecstasy by her night spent with the wolf.Sleeping with her head on his leg.The poor thing looked emaciated still, somewhat as in the tunnel.I want to go back out, she said now when she woke up.Come with me.I want to follow the caribou again, and they need beaters.Maybe Ill see my wolf too.All right.He saw to the arrangements, and the next morning they joined the rest going north that day, and heloed out in a frost steamed sunrise.Look, Swan said as the sun cracked the distant horizon, leaning over him to stare right into it.You can burn your eyes here too, he said.You can burn your eyes out even on Saturn.I know, I know.I look without looking.The new light cracked in shards on the numberless patches of water spread on the land.Near the Thelon River they landed and got out, the helo buzzed away, and suddenly they were on the vast windy tundra, walking on variously crunchy or squishy ground, in some ways like the icy ground of Titan.Wahram upped the support of his body bra and tried to accustom himself to the give of the soggy land.For a while the act of walking over the broken ground of the semi frozen caribou path felt like working in a waldo, and because of the body bra, in a way it was.He straightened up and looked around.Sunlight mirrorflaked off water into his brain, and he adjusted the polarization in his glasses.Swan kept pulling down her glasses to look around with her naked eyes: sometimes she reeled, tears frozen on her cracked red cheeks, but she laughed or moaned orgasmically.Wahram only tried it once.Youre going to go blind, he told her.They used to do it all the time!They used to live without any glasses!I believe the Inuit protected their eyes, he groused.Strips of leather or some such thing.Anyway, it was something to withstand.They were stunted by life up here, held back from full humanity by their own harsh planet.She hooted at this and threw a snowball at him.How you lie!We are bubbles of Earth!Bubbles of Earth!Yes, yes, he said.Lark Rise to Candleford.We were taught it too.When alone in the fields, with no one to see them, they would hop, skip, and jump, touching the ground as lightly as possible and crying, We are bubbles of Earth!Bubbles of Earth!Bubbles of Earth!Exactly!You were brought up Unitarian?Arent we all?But no, I read it in Crowley.And I cant hop, skip, or jump in this g.  I would trip and fall.Oh come on, get tough.She regarded him.You must weigh a lot here.But youve been here a long time, you should be used to it.I havent been doing much walking, I confess.My work has been more sedentary.Recreating Florida, sedentary?Then its good youre out here.She was happy.He stumped along comfortably enough; he had been exaggerating the impact of the g, just to annoy her.Now the cold air and the sunlight were giving the day a kind of crystalline quality.It is good, he admitted.So they walked the southern edge of the caribous route east, and Swan planted transponders and photographed tracks and took soil and fecal samples.In the evenings they gathered with other trackers at a big dining tent set up daily in a new position.In the short nights they lay on cots in the same tent and caught a few hours of sleep before eating and heading out again.After the third day of the beat they had to deal with the helicoptered arrival of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, who arrested them and flew them to Ottawa.No way!Swan cried as they watched the land unfurl below them.We werent even in Canada!Actually we were.The vast fields of wheat at midday looked very different than they had during their recent morning trip out.Look at that!Swan exclaimed at one point, gesturing down with disdain.It looks like an algae bloom on a pond.In Ottawa, when they were released from custody, Swan took Wahram to the Mercury House to clean up and try to find out what was happening.News of the reanimation was still all over, and there were too many stories to tell, because everyone in the world was telling their story at once, in the usual manner but even more so; so it was hard for them to find out their own storyspecifically, why they had been arrested.They had been released without charge, and no one in Ottawa seemed to know anything about why they had been pulled in.On the newsfeeds clusters had already formed, one could watch images arranged alphabetically by animal or region or several other categoriesworst landings, animal actions beautiful or comic, human cruelties against animals, animal aggression against humans, and so forth.They watched the screens in the dining hall as they ate, and afterward walked the narrow streets by the blackish river and canal system, dropping in on pubs here and there to have a drink and see more.Soon enough Swan was getting in drunken arguments with other patrons; she made no secret of her spacer origins, which would have been hard to do anyway, given the way she looked, and the graceful but stylized way she moved in her body bra.Wahram thought people looked up at her with a bit of fear in their gazes.A round on the Mercury House, thats where Im from, she would declare when people got pissy, which of course helped, but wasnt a complete solution.You people should be happy the animals are back, she would tell them.Youve been cut off from them for so long youve forgotten how great they are.Theyre our horizontal brothers and sisters, enslaved as living meat, and when that can happen to them it can happen to you too, and it has.You people are meat!It stinks!Catcalls and ugly rumbling disagreement would greet this.At some point you have to get it!Swan would shout, overriding the various objections filling the air.No one can be happy until everyone is safe!Heppy, one of them said, voice dripping with Slavic scorn.Whats heppy?We need food.The farms in the north give us food.You need soil, Swan said, making it a long word with two syllables.Soy yull is your food.Sheer total biomass is your food!The animals help make biomass.You cant do without them.Youre hanging on by eating oil.Youre eating your seed corn.If it werent for the food coming down the elevators from space, half of you would starve and the other half kill each other.Thats the truth, you know it is!So what do you need?Animals.They can pull my plow, one said sourly.Most of these people spoke Russian to each other, and Wahram struggled to hear voices using English.When they spoke to Swan, they spoke in English.She was talking again about the horizontal brothers and sisters.Many who listened were sufficiently high on vodka and other substances that their eyes shone, their cheeks were red.They liked arguing with Swan; they liked being tongue lashed by her.They had looked the same in 1905, no doubt, or 1789, or 1776.It could have been a room anywhere, anytime.It reminded him of the corner pub in his neighborhood of the bulge.Were part of a family, Swan was insisting now, going maudlin.The mammal family.Mammals are an order, someone objected.Mammals are a class, someone else corrected.We are the class of mammals, Swan exclaimed, and the order is to suckle and to love!Cheers to this.Its that or die.Our horizontal brothers and sisters.We need them, we need all of them, were part of them and theyre part of us!Without them were justjust  Poor forked radishes!Brains and fingertips!Worms in a bottle!Yes!Swan said.Exactly.Like spacers in space, someone added.They laughed at that, and she did too.Its true, she cried.But here we are!Im on Earth, right now.Her cheeks burned and she looked around at them; she stood on a bench and caught them up: Were on Earth!You have no idea what a privilege that is.You fucking moles!Youre home!You can take all the spacer habitats together and theyd still be nothing compared to this world!This is home.Cheers.Though it seemed to Wahram, as he caught Swan falling off her bench toward the bar, that what she had said wasnt really true, not anymorenot with Mars up there, and Venus and Titan coming on board.Maybe it hadnt been true since the diaspora.So they cheered her for being wrong, for flattering them, for buying the drinks and catching them all up in a moment of enthusiasm.They were cheering for this moment itself, detached from anything else.Night in a pub in Ottawa, with drunks singing in Russian.This moment of the storm.They went back out with visas, in case they got stopped again by the Mounties, and rejoined the beater line for the caribou migration.No one stopped them in Yellowknife, and no one they spoke with knew what had happened before.In a couple of days they were back in their field routine, which made Wahram happy.He was used to the walking now, had adjusted his bodysuit to it, and got a lot of pleasure from watching Swan on the hunt.She was always ahead, but then again she looked good from behind.Diana on the hunt.In the dining tent at night they were hearing more often from reports worldwide that people were finding the reappearance of animals in their world hard to handle.Lions and tigers and bears, oh my!People were unused to being potential prey for big predators lurking right at the edge of town.It was enough to make them band together.Those who used to go out on their own now usually found company.Some who didnt got eaten, and the rest shivered and complained and then sought out friends or strangers to walk with, not just at night but in the broad light of day.This was standard practice already in the terraria; going out alone was a luxury, a kind of decadenceor an adventure undertaken with a sense of the risk involved, as with Swan.It was obvious if you had grown up with it, oppressive if you hadnt: out in the woods, humans needed to stick together.Quickly too the animals were learning how dangerous people were.In fact many more animals were dying than people in the new encounters, which was no surprise to anyone.But it was a robust inoculant, and would prevail.The two of them went out one morning with extra bags of gear, because Swan wanted to range farther than they could in a day and still get back to the dining tent.The caribou had massed on the banks of the Thelon River at a ford new to them, and she wanted to get around to the north side of them, to observe and to discourage the beasts from heading north in the shallows on the west side, looking for a better ford; they were already at the best spot, a place that the archeologists said had been used by caribou in the past.So they walked north.At a certain point they crossed the caribou track.The ground was chewed into a sea of chaotic brown sastrugi; every step had to be made carefully.Swan was faster than Wahram by an even larger margin than usual, but he was determined not to hurry.A couple of times the corpse of a caribou drove the point home: falls could be dangerous.There were knee high clumps of semi frozen mud to contend with, and they made him nervous.He could scarcely stand to watch the way she waltzed over them.But she made no mistakes; and he had to keep his gaze on his feet.It didnt matter how far she got ahead.When they reached unshattered ground north of the migration path, Swan led him east.Look, Swan said, pointing.Wolves.Theyre waiting to see how the crossing goes.Wahram had become aware that Swan loved wolves, so he said nothing about the bloodthirsty nature of scavengers.Everyone had to eat, after all.The caribou were massed on the near shore of the ford, about half a kilometer away.Swan wanted to be seen by the beasts, so she hiked up a short bluff overlooking the riverbed, which was a broad gravel wash, crisscrossed by river channels braiding in it; the entire wash was a maze of old lines of rounded rocks and the curved black dips of dried oxbows.Much of it would not be good footing for the caribou, and Wahram could see why Swan wanted them to cross at the ford, where solid permafrost soil made a flat brown and green road on both sides.Look, the first ones are trying it.Wahram joined her side and looked south.Hundreds of caribou were massed on their side of the river, tossing their antlers and bellowing.The large males at the front were testing the river with forelegs, pawing at it, and then one made a break and several others followed immediately, splashing knee deep in water for the most part, then abruptly going in to the chest, spraying big waves before them.Uh oh, Swan said.Its deep there.But the leaders walked or swam on, working hard, and soon they surged back up to knee depth and smashed the water white on their way out.On the far shore they looked back and bellowed.By this time more of them were in the water, and the mass began to move slowly forward, funneling as those on the sides tried to get to the center.They wanted to bunch together, Wahram saw.That drop off will be the trouble spot, Swan predicted, and it was so; as the beasts hit the water some bellowed and tried to turn back, but were shoved and even nipped until they carried on; but that made for a jammed crowd back in the shallows, and the uproar of their bellowing was loud over the already big noise of the river sluicing through its infinity of rocks.A few beasts on the left flank turned and began to head north, but Swan jumped up and down and waved her arms, and Wahram took a little compressed air horn she offered him and let off a couple of blasts.It was loud in a high and urgent way, but he thought it was Swans violent motion that turned the beasts back; and at that point the logjam of beasts at the deep point of the ford swam forward together, and soon the breakaway was forgotten and the whole herd was powering across in a storm of white water and steaming brown bodies.It took most of an hour.There were some accidents, some broken limbs, and even drownings, but there was never again any pause in the herd.Swan watched closely, pointing out a line of wolves on the bank downstream, snagging drowned caribou calves with their teeth and dragging them in teams back up out of the water.It was only at that point that the river ran with ribbons of red.Will the wolves cross too?Wahram asked.I dont know.In the terraria they often would, but the streams arent as big as this.You knowyou see it inside a terrarium and its great, but this is different.I wonder if they think so too.I mean, theyve done this a lot, but always looking up at the land.Theyve never been out under the sky.I wonder what they think of the sky!Dont you wonder?Hmm, Wahram said, considering it.Even to him the sight of the Terran sky was almost inconceivably odd.It must look strange.They must have a sense of space, theyre migrating creatures, after all.They migrate in the terraria.So they must know this is different.From the inside of a cylinder to the outside of a sphereno, if they feel that He shook his head.I think they seem more panicked than usual.More wild.Maybe so.How are we ourselves going to get across?We swim!No, not really.Our aerogels will work as rafts, well float across.If were lucky!She led him down to the ford, where the scent of the caribou was strong, and strips of fur eddied in the shallows.The wind poured through him, and he could feel his lungs etched as cold shapes, pulsing and alive.Come on, she said, we have to get out of here before the wolves get here to clean up on the poor dead babies.All right, but show me how.Your mattress is your raft, we each have one.Its kind of like a coracle of aerogel, so its hard to see but youll float in it fine.If you tip over you have to hold on to it, or else swim fast.Ill hope not to tip over.Thats for sure!This water is freezing.Here, take this branch to paddle.I think the thing to do is to walk out as far as youre comfortable, then get in and let yourself be taken downstream, and paddle when you can for the far shore.We dont need to be in any hurry, because the first curve of the river downstream will put us over near the other side anyway.And youll feel it when youre over the shallows on the other side.Follow me, youll see.So he did; but he bounced on the water, and his raft felt too small, and the deepest part of the current swept him by Swan, who was laughing at him; then he paddled hard.She caught up with him, paddling in circles, and shouted to him, Put your head under the water!No!he exclaimed indignantly, but she laughed and shouted back, Put at least one ear under the water, you have to hear it!Listen to it underwater!And she leaned out from her coracle and ducked her head under for a few moments, then pulled out sputtering and laughing.Try it!she commanded.You have to hear!So gingerly he leaned out and stuck his right ear under the dancing surface of the water, holding his breath, and was astonished to find that he had immersed himself in a loud electric clicking utterly unlike anything he had heard before in his life.He pulled his ear out, heard the rush of the world, then stuck his whole head back in, holding his breath, and heard with both ears that electrifying clicking and clacking sound, which must have been the sound of stones rolling hard over the river bottom, thrown along by the rapid current.He pulled out, blowing like a walrus.Swan was laughing at him and shaking her head like a dog.Hows that for music!she shouted.Then Wahrams coracle scraped the shallows on the other side and he jumped out, but tripped and fell.He was just able to grab the little raft as he splashed and clambered to his feet, then sloshed up to dry land.Not elegant at all, but he was still alive, and his bodysuit kept him dry and warmnow that was the technological sublime.And they were on the far shore.Swan found a high point above the river and pitched their tent just before dark.The tent was a single big shell, transparent and bouncy on transparent tent poles.Their rafts would serve as their beds.They sat outside the door of the tent and Swan cooked them first a soup made from powder, then pasta with a pesto and Gorgonzola sauce.Finally chocolates for dessert, and a little flask of cognac.It was still twilight when they were done, though the sun had set an hour before.The tent flapped in the wind, and the immense sluicing of the river over its rocks rumbled up out of the ground and filled the air.They had been going for eighteen hours straight, and when Swan said, Time for bed, Wahram nodded and yawned.The sleeping bags she pulled from their backpacks were also aerogels and resembled the mattress rafts, as well as their tent material, and for that matter the bubbles they had drifted down inall aerogels, hard to see, light, squishy, warm.But well still be cold unless we sleep together, Swan said, crawling into his bag beside him and pulling both bags over them.Ah yes, Wahram said.Im sure.In the semidarkness he could afford a smile.She kissed him, though, and caught him in the act.What, she said.Nothing.She rolled onto him, and their combined weight caused his back to touch the ground under his mattress.It was a chill touch and he had to mention it.We may have to stay side to side.Hell no, Swan said, and squiggled out of the bag.Here, get up a second, lets put my bag under the mattress.That should do it.It did.By then they were cold.She got the top of his bag over them properly and climbed onto him, shivering; and after a tight hug she shifted around and started kissing him again.Her mouth was warm.She was a good kisser, passionate and playful.Her penis, so much littler than his, was nevertheless poking his belly, feeling something like a belt buckle gone awry.He too was fully aroused, and getting happier by the second.Now it was said that their particular combination of genders was the perfect match, a complete experience, the double lock and key, all possible pleasures at once; but Wahram had always found it rather complicated.As with most wombmen, his little vagina was located far enough down in his pubic hair that his own erection blocked access to it; the best way to engage there once he was aroused was for the one with the big vagina to slide down onto the big penis most of the way, then lean out but also back in, in a somewhat acrobatic move for both partners.Then with luck the little join could be made, and the double lock and key accomplished, after which the usual movements would work perfectly well, and some fancier back and forths also.Swan turned out to be perfectly adept at the join, and after that she laughed and kissed him again.They warmed up pretty fast.Lists (14)  A round mound made of big

smile.Feeling that feeling in her made her able to think of Alex and Terminator and everything that had happened in a way she could tolerate; so her mood was a strange mix of pain and happiness.A fearful joy, yes.Certain wolf howls, of a kind she had often heard, including in the last month on the taiga, combined just such emotions, mourning and joy, and expressed her current mood quite precisely.She whisper howled when she heard them out in the night, as she was with Wahram and the others at camp; she didnt like to howl fully when other people were around.She howled inside.When Jacques Cartier had kidnapped some local chiefs for transport back to France, the night before the ships left, people had gathered on the shore and howled like wolves all night long.One morning Wahram got a call and took it outside the dining tent, and when he came back in, he was looking thoughtful.Listen, he said to Swan as they trudged out over the tundra, wind and sun at their backs.I need to go back out to Saturn again.Theres a meeting been called of all the people who were helping Alex.They want it in person so they can keep it off the record.And whats it about?Swan asked.Well, he said cautiously, it has to do with what appears to be a new type of qube.So I shouldnt really say more.I know when people are talking about me, Pauline announced.We know that, Swan snapped.Be quiet.Anyway, Wahram said, I think you should join this meeting.And you can do me a favor.Jean Genette is out of touch in an aquarium, and we need to get word to him about this meeting.I should go to Titan directly, but if you could go tell Jean about it on your way out, that would help.And Jean can maybe tell you more about whats going on.All right, Swan said.I can do that.Good.Wahram smiled his tiny smile.But Swan could tell he was distracted.Extracts (17)  As many people have significant lifelong quantities of male and female hormones and phenotypically are bisexual, intersex, or indeterminate,

balkanized.Gender therapy and speciation were both parts of the longevity project, and the combination of the three created a new structure of feeling that is often characterized as fractured, compartmentalized, bulkheaded, firewalled.Usually longevity itself is identified as the primary force driving this; until now, no one has had to integrate a personality in its second century (or more), and often it is experienced as an existential crisis.The super elderly have had so many experiences, gone through so many phases, lost so many companions to death or simply time that they have

CHATEAU GARDEN  Swan flew south and took the Quito elevator up again, and again sat in on the performance of Satyagraha, singing along with the rest of the audience, dancing as an extra when everyone else did, trailing banners at the end of the first act.All the chaos of the repetitive voices crisscrossing in the middle act felt exactly right to her now, true to life.She could punch out those chants like shouting at an enemy.The struggle for peace was more struggle than peace, but now she was energized and into the flow of it.Up in Bolivar she hurried to catch a ferry going out to meet the Chateau Garden, a big terrarium that she herself had designed when she was youngfool that she had been.This one was a Loire or Thames chateaux landscape, the big boxy stone mansions tastefully scattered about among fields of barley, hops, vineyards, and formal gardens.It was as green as ever, she found, and looked like one of those horrid virtual game landscapes in which nothing has quite enough texture.Almost every plant in the formal gardens surrounding the great houses was a work of topiary, and not only was this a questionable idea in itself, but these had been left to go wild: the artist had gone out ice skating on one of the ponds and fallen through the ice and drowned.Now all the whales and otters and tapirs looked as if they were being lifted up by their hair.In the town itself (slate roofs, wood beams crossing plaster walls in standard pseudotudor) there was a large park, with a big smooth lawn, actually another of the topiarists masterpieces: the grass of this lawn was not simply grass, but also very fine alpine meadow grasses, sedges, and mosses, in a dense mix that also included a number of tiny low alpine ground cover flowers, including bilberry, moss campion, aster, and saxifrage, all together creating a millefleur effect that made it like walking over a living Persian carpet.Within this colorful carpet were long strips of pure fine grass, as on putting greens, all running lengthwise to the cylinder.A lawn bowling field, in fact, with about a dozen rinks.It was winter here, as if they were in Patagonia or New Zealand, and the light from the sunspot on the sunline smeared so that shadows blurred at the edges, and the air looked rusty.Small clouds had bunched around the sunspot, white puffballs glazed pink.The shadows of these clouds dappled the town and its park, and the rolling barley fields and vineyards spread out overhead.Terrarium vertigo washed through Swan for a second as she looked up at them.There was no Mercury House here, so she took an empty ramada on the edge of the park, under a line of sycamore trees, gorgeous in their stark winter tones.Feeling too full to sit or lie down, she put her travel bag on the square bed and went out for a walk.She stopped for tea in the village, and sitting in the caf saw that a group of people were going out to the bowling green.She tossed down the last of the tea and went out to watch.Each strip of putting grass was called a rink, and they were set lengthwise in the cylinder so that the rink would lay flat.That was important, as the Coriolis force was strong enough to push every shot to the right.The balls were asymmetrical as well, as was traditional in the sport; they were squashed spheres, like Saturn or Iapetus, and when thrown they would roll on their biggest circumference like a fat wheel, as long as they were going fast enough, but then might flop onto their side at the end, thus accentuating the fernlike curvature of the roll.It required a neat touch to put a bowl where you wanted it.A young person approached and asked if she wanted to play a game on one of the empty rinks.Yes, thanks.The youth picked up a bag of bowls and led her to the farthest empty rink, near the edge of the field.The youth dumped the balls on the exquisite grass and Swan took one of them up.She hefted it along its long diameter; it weighed about a kilo, just as she recalled.It had been a while since she had last played.She went to the mat on which throwers had to stay, and tried to make a simple toss down the middle, on the slow side, hoping the bowl would end up in front of the jack and serve as a blocker to her opponents bowls.It ran down the rink, curving only a bit, then flopped to a halt about where she wanted it.The youth chose a bowl, went to the mat, took a couple of steps forward, then crouched for a final step and the laying of the ball on the sward.Very graceful, and the ball rolled smoothly down the course, running a line that looked to be well to the left of the jack, even headed out of the rink and into the ditch, as out of bounds was called.But then the Coriolis force got its push into it and the ball curved right ever more sharply, tracing a kind of Fibonacci infalling, until it tucked in just behind the jack.Swan would now have to try to get around her own blocker, or knock it back into the jack, so that hopefully the jack would bounce away.Four bowls per end, and with three to go they were already looking at a crowded space around the jack.Swan considered it for a while, then decided to try to use the bias of the bowl to roll one back against the C force and see if she could get around her blocker and tap the jack.It would require a very fine touch, and the moment she made the shot she could see that she had put too much on it.Ah damn, she said, and was vexed enough to add, Im not making any excuses or anything, but I have an excuse for that.Of course.Have you seen that shirt with all the excuses printed on it?They made that shirt by listening to me and writing things down.Ha ha.Which one this time?Well, Ive just spent almost a year on Earth.Im throwing everything long.I bet.What were you doing there?Working on animal stuff.The invasion, you mean?The rewilding.Huh.What was that like?It was interesting.She didnt want to talk about it right now, and she suspected the youth knew that and only wanted to distract her.Your shot.Yes.The youths waist to hips ratio was sort of girlish, the shoulder to waist to ground lengths sort of boyish.Possibly a gynandromorph.The youths shot ran almost true and flopped right beside the jack.This end was looking bad for Swan.Her only recourse now was to try to knock her own blocker into the jack and hope the jack went into the ditch, which would make for a dead end.It could be done if she could throw fast and straight on the right heading.She put her little finger on the big circle of the bias, and concentrated on keeping an upright form with a straight follow through.She rolled, and again on release knew she had missed.Damn.The youth was again amused.You have to have every finger on it when you let go.Some people do, she said.The youth shrugged in reply.Quite young; perhaps thirty years old; a spacer.Is this your home?Swan asked.No.Where are you going?Nowhere.The youth made a shot, which was a nicely placed blocker that meant it would be harder than ever for Swan to hit the jack with her final roll.The only chance was that same backhand.She made her last shot and was pleased to see it roll down, take a late turn in, and bang the jack right out of the rink.Dead end, the youth said calmly.Swan nodded.They played several more ends, and the youth never made a shot that was anything less than superb.Swan lost every time.Youre some kind of ringer, Swan said, feeling irritated.But were not betting.Lucky for me.She managed again to knock out the jack.On they played.Neither seemed in any hurry to do anything else; space voyages could be like that.It felt to Swan like shuffleboard on an Atlantic ocean liner.They were rich in timethey had time to kill.The youth made several shots that were simply perfect.Swan kept throwing long, and losing.It occurred to her that this must be how Virginia Woolf had felt when she played with her husband Leonard, an expert lawn bowler from his years administering Ceylon.Virginia too had lost almost every time.The youth seemed not to care one way or the other.Leonard had probably been much the same.Well, but quite a few people played sports mostly against themselves, their opponents no more than random shifters of the problems they faced in their own performance.Still, this young person began to bother her.The neat picking up of the mat.The final flick of the fingertips at the end of a throw.The exquisite final fern tips of the Coriolised curves.Only much later that night, as she was lying in her ramada, did it occur to Swan that the pebbles thrown at Terminator had been like a kind of lawn bowling.The thought made her sit up in bed.Set up a mat, launch a bowlthat jack would be covered.Quantum Walk (2)  easy to note the moment Venus g is exceeded 1.0 g feels like

Once irritated by a problem, Jean Genette never really gave up on it.Even problems officially solved sometimes still had a haunting quality, because of things that didnt quite fit, didnt seem rightand if a solution never was found, the problem became part of the insomniac rosary, one bead in a Moebius bracelet of beads wearily fingered in the brains sleepless hours.Genette was still working on the problem of Ernesta Travers, for instance, which thirty years before had troubled them all with the fundamental question of why their friend Ernesta had engineered a disappearance from Mars, as well as how; it was a case Jean could pursue in exile, and from time to time did, but Travers was still as absent as if she had never existed.Same with the puzzle of the prison terrarium Nelson Mandela, a locked room mystery if ever there was one, as the asteroid seemed to have afforded no ingress or egress for whoever had brought in the fatal gun.Mysteries like that abounded in the system; it was part of the affect realm of the balkanization, many felt, but balkanization per se was not enough to explain some of these mysteries, and the inspector remained puzzled and moretransfixed, existentially confused, frustratedby their aura of impossibility.Sometimes the inspector would walk for hour after hour, trying to make the explanation appear.The problem of the pebble attack was not like that.It was still a new case by Genettes standard, and it had no aura of impossibility.Almost anyone in space could have done it, and many down under atmospheres could have paid for it, or gone into space and done it, then dropped back into their atmospheres.It was a needle in haystack problem, and balkanization made that problem worse by multiplying the haystacks.But this was Interplans territory, in the end, and so on sifting the haystacks they went, eliminating what they could and moving on.It seemed pretty clear to Genette that on this one they would be looking in the unaffiliateds eventually, prying open closed worlds and poking around for the maker of the launch mechanism and the operators of the spaceship now crushed deep within Saturn.By no means were all their avenues of inquiry exhausted; there were at least two hundred unaffiliateds with robust industrial capacities; so it was more like they had barely begun.Swan Er Hong rejoined Genette inside the aquarium South Pacific 101, a water world that filled its interior cylinder with water to a depth of ten meters, spinning against the interior of a big chunk of ice that had been melted and refrozen in such a way as to leave it transparent, so that from space the whole thing looked like a clear chunk of hail.Genette had sailed the Hellas Sea as a child, and learned to love the wild slop of a windy day in Martian g, and even all these years later had not lost the little thrill that came with feeling the fluctuating wind in ones fingertips on tiller and linethe feeling of being picked up and thrown over the water in plunge after plunge.The little sea in this aquarium was not as grand as Hellas, of course, but sailing remained sailing.And from inside an aquarium with walls this clear, the view inside a cylinder was as if looking at and through a curved silvery mirror, everywhere broken up by the crisscrossing waves formed by the Coriolis current and the chiral wind, creating between them very complex patterns.It was as if the classic patterns of a physics class wave tank were here topologically warped onto the inside of a cylinder.Intersecting waves on this surface curved in non Euclidean ways, a strange and lovely thing to see in all the mirrored silvers.And behind all the silvers lay blues.Inside the transparent shell of the aquarium, with the ocean also the sky, every silvery surface on the sunward side of the cylinder was backed or filled by a deep eggshell blue, while if one was looking away from the sun, the backing blue was an equally rich but much darker shade, almost indigo, and flecked here and there by the white pricks of the brightest stars.A floating town disrupted this cylindrical sea, but Genette spent most of the time on the water, sailing a trimaran at the fastest angles the winds offered.On hearing Swan was there, Genette sailed into Pitcairn and picked her up.There she stood on the end of the dock, fizzing in her usual waytall, arms crossed, hungry look in her eye.She glared down at the inspectors sailboat suspiciously; it was sized for smalls, and Swan was just barely going to fit.Genette dismissed her suggestion to take out a larger boat, and placed her on the windward pontoon with her feet on the main hull, while he sat in the cockpit, holding a wheel that seemed to come from a much larger vessel.And there they were, talking as they skidded over the waves like a shearwater.With such a big weight to windward, Genette could really catch a lot of wind on the mainsail, and the bow of Swans pontoon knocked a lot of spray up into the blues.Out getting banged on by the wind obviously pleased Swan.She looked around at things more than when Genette had last traveled with her.She looked slightly electrocuted, one might say.She had been on Earth for the reanimation, so no doubt that had made her happy.But there was also a new set to her mouth, a little chisel mark between her eyebrows.Wahram sent me to say you need to get out to a meeting on Titan, she said.Its Alexs group, and theyre meeting off the grid to discuss something important.Something about qubes.Im going to go too.So can you tell me what this is all about?Buying a little time to think it over, Genette brought the boat about and had Swan change pontoons.Once set on the new course, a tug on the mainsheet tilted her upright.She grinned a little fiercely at this sailors evasion, shook her head; she would not be distracted.Although in fact this shift had brought them on course to catch one of the waves breaking on the reef.Genette pointed this out, and together they watched the swells as Genette trimmed the sails for more speed.They skidded over the water in a broad turn that met the wave as it was rising on the reef; the trimaran was lifted and then caught by the wave, surfing across its face, falling more than sailing, and yet the wind on the top half of the sail served to keep them ahead of the break, if Genette could capture it right.Swan proved expert at providing a counterweight, leaning and shifting in response to the fluctuations of the ride.Where the reef petered out, the wave lost its white teeth and laid back into a mere swell.After one last bump over the backwash of a crossing wave, they were only sailing again.Well done, Swan said.You must sail a lot.Yes, I travel in aquaria when I can.So by now Ive sailed most of them.Or iceboated them.When theyre frozen inside, you can get going like in a centrifuge.I was just up in Inuit country myself, but it was summer and all the ice was gone.Except for the damn pingos.They sailed on for a while.Overhead their water silvered sky bent through a smooth curve of blues from turquoise to indigo.Swan said, But back to this meeting.Wahram said it had something to do with some new qubes.So do you remember that time we were in the Inner Mongolia and I met those silly girls, and I thought they were people?And you thought they might be some strange qube people?Yes, of course, the inspector said.They were.Well, a strange thing happened to me on the way out here.I was lawn bowling with a young person in the Chateau Garden, and this kid was trying to impinge on my attention, I guess I would call it, without actually saying very much.It was mostly in the play of the game, but also it was like the long stare you sometimes get from wolves.Theres a thing wolves do when theyre on the hunt called the long stare.Its unnerving to prey animals, to the point where some quit trying as hard to get away.Genette, familiar with the look and the technique, nodded.And this person had a long stare.So it seemed, yes.Maybe that was part of what gave me the creeps.Ive had wolves look at me that way.I could see in my peripheral vision how different it was from an ordinary look.Maybe that was how a sociopath looks at people.A wolf person.Well, but I like wolves.Perhaps like a qube, Genette suggested.Not like the ones on the Inner Mongolia, but not quite human either.Maybe.When I talk about the long stare, Im just trying to figure it out.Because it was unnerving.And then the way this kid was lawn bowlingas if it meant something.Genette regarded her, interested by this.As if lawn bowling might be the tossing of balls at a target?Exactly.Thats what it is, yes?She shook her head, frowning at this.Genette sighed.Anyway, it should be perfectly easy to ask the Chateau Garden for a manifest.I did that, and looked at all the photos.This lawn bowler wasnt there.Hmm.Genette thought about it.Can you share your qubes records with me?Yes, of course.She shifted from the pontoon to the cockpit, and Genette came up into the wind a bit.She leaned over and asked Pauline to transfer the photos she had already pulled.Genette inspected Passepartouts little wristpad display.There, Swan said, pointing to one photo.Thats the one.And thats the look I mean.The inspector studied the image: an androgynous face, an intent look.It doesnt really come through in a photo.What do you mean?Look at that!I am, but this person could be thinking of a calculus problem, or suffering a moment of indigestion.No!It wasnt like that in person.I think you should see if you can find this kid.If you can, youll see for yourself.And if you cant, it gets kind of mysterious, doesnt it?This person wasnt on the manifest.So if you cant find them, maybe the look will begin to mean more to you.Maybe, Genette said.This was the kind of break in a case that amateurs hoped for, which in reality seldom happened.On the other hand, it might be some kind of move on the part of the qubes.Some of the ones inhabiting humanoid bodies had behaved so oddly it was hard to know what they might or might not do.The question now was how much Swan could be trusted, given how permanent her qube was, and how little was known about it.Not for the first time Genette was grateful that Passepartout was located in a wristpad that could be turned off, or taken off if necessary.Of course it was possible to ask Swan to turn off Pauline, as before.Secrecy from qubes could be achieved, even when they were stuck inside your head.It only had to be arranged.And on Titan the Alexandrines would be arranging for a sequestered conversation.It was clearly the next step if they were going to fold Swan into the new effort.Genette watched her while thinking it over.We need to talk with Wahram and the whole group involved with this.There are things you need to know, but the meeting there will be the best place to tell you.All right, she said.Lets go then.TITAN  Titan is larger than Pluto, larger than Mercury.It has a nitrogen atmosphere, like Earths but ten times more dense.Temperature at the surface is ninety K, but there is a liquid water ocean deep under its surface that serves as a reservoir of potential warmth.On the surface all the water is frozen very hard and forms the material of the landscapeglacial to every horizon, with rock ejecta scattered here and there like warts and carbuncles.Here methane and ethane play the role of water on Earth, changing from a vapor in the nitrogen atmosphere to clouds that rain down into streams and lakes running over the water ice.Sunlight hitting this atmosphere strikes up a yellow smog of complex organic molecules.The hydrogen in this haze escapes easily into space, but while in Titans air, it drives all the bigger organic molecules back to simpler building blocks; so there are not many complex organics, and therefore no indigenous life.Not even in the water ocean below, as if the corrosive atmosphere formed some kind of quarantine.The glacial surface is broken in most places, smooth in a few.When you stand on the surface, you can see Saturn, with a thin slicing curve of the edge on rings cutting the gas ball in half; you can also see the brighter stars.The haze in the Titanic air is of a thickness such that looking out of it, visibility is fairly good, while looking into it is to see nothing but a yellow cloud.No impact craters; as they are formed in ice, the ice then deforms and resurfaces as the centuries pass.There is only a convoluted, swirling chaos of broken ice features and rock outcroppings, cut by liquid methane into shapes like watersheds.Dips in the land are filled with liquid methane: Titans Lake Ontario is three hundred kilometers across, and shaped like the one on Earth.There is seasonal weather, as Saturn makes its way from perihelion to aphelion: methane rain in the rainy season.It was the nitrogen that first brought people to Titan.Martians, unhappy with the never explained shortage of nitrogen on Mars, flew out in the first ships fast enough to be practical for human use over these distances; robots had preceded them, of course.They set up stations, built a system for gathering and freezing nitrogen and casting it downsystem in naked solid chunks.People complained this was an unauthorized expropriation, but the Martians pointed out that Titan in its distant past had had several times as thick an atmosphere as it had now, that the nitrogen was leaking away to space to no ones advantage, that if it wasnt harvested it would go awayand that there were no Titans.The last argument was decisive.By the time there were Titans, by the time Titan and the rest of the Saturn League had ejected the Martian nitrogen miners from their system, Titans atmosphere had been reduced by half.Mars was correspondingly enriched, with part of the imported nitrogen in its soil, part in the atmosphere; it formed a crucial component of the Martian Miracle.And the Martians claimed no harm had been done; that in fact it had helped Titans future prospects, by getting it closer to a human friendly pressure.The loss of Dione in those same years, however, was not a loss that could be claimed to help Saturnians in any way.The Saturn League then declared their system off limits to Martians, also to Terrans (the Chinese in particular)to anyone, in fact, except themselves.It was the first post Martian revolution, against the great revolutionaries themselves, a statement very forcefully made by the threat of bombardment.So everything changed once again, because of a few people on Titan.The new light from the Vulcanoids sparking now in the skies of Titan had already started temperatures in the remaining atmosphere to rise, and the surface was therefore subliming faster than before.The tented cities in the highlands now had some of the most violent weather anywhere.From the inside of the city tents, the Titans watched clouds rising in thunderheads that sheered off horizontally some five kilometers up, where jet streams decapitated them.Sunlight before had been one one hundredth of that striking Earth, making the whole planet seem about as bright as an ordinary room; now, with its beamed and reflected additions, it was fifty times brighter than it had been naturally, and was said to resemble the light on Mars, which the Martians said was the best light of all.In truth the human eye could adjust to a huge range of incoming light, and very little would serve for seeing, as had been the case here before the mirrorlight arrived.Now however the Titanic landscape positively glowed, and as its orbit and day were both sixteen days long, the sunsets, when they tinted the clouds to every shade of mineral glory, burnished the sky for some eighteen hours at a time.With the new influx of light, the full terraformation of Titan seemed very promising.They could capture and export the methane and ethane; spread foamed rock to make islands on the ice; use heat from the ocean below to warm the atmosphere; melt water lakes on their islands of rock and soil; landscape the islands, introduce bacteria, plants, animals; heat the air enough to get melted seas on the glacier surfaces; hold the atmosphere inside an ultrathin bubble; and light everything with the sunlight sent up from the Vulcanoids.The Titans looked out their tent walls with sharp anticipation.My oh my, they said.If we can just keep our shit together here were gonna make this a real nice place.SWAN AND GENETTE AND WAHRAM  It was in one of the famous Titanic sunsets that Swan saw Wahram, crossing the gallery deck to greet her and Inspector Genette.She ran to him and embraced him, then let him go and looked at him, feeling shy.But he gave her that brief smile of his, and she saw that all was well between them.Absence makes the heart grow fonderespecially, she thought, absence from her.Welcome to our work in progress, he said.You see how the Vulcan light is helping us.Its beautiful, she said.But is it enough light to heat you?Can you get up to biosphere temperatures, wouldnt that be almost two hundred K higher?The light alone cant do it.But we have an interior ocean that averages about two hundred eighty K, so heat per se is no problem.Well shift some of that heat out to our air.And with this extra light helping, itll be fine, even more than fine.There will be gas balance problems, but we can work them out.Im happy for you.She looked up at the immense thunderheads over the tent, flaring orange and salmon and bronze.Above the clouds, brilliant chips of light blazed in a royal blue sky, chips bigger and brighter than any stars: a few of the gathering mirror solettas, she assumed, redirecting the Vulcan light to Titans nightside.The huge thunderheads, lit by the sun from one side and mirrors from the other, looked like marble statues of clouds.The sunset was going to last a couple of days, they told her.Beautiful, Swan said.Thanks, he said.This is my real home, believe it or not.Now lets grab the inspector and go for a walk.We want to talk to you in confidence.Is everyone else here?Genette asked him when they approached.
