    Prologue.Dumb Luck and Smart Thinking  The first bit of dumb luck came disguised as a public embarrassment for the European Center for Defense Against Disease.On July 23, schoolchildren in Algiers claimed that a respiratory epidemic was spreading across the Mediterranean.The claim was based on clever analysis of antibody data from the mass transit systems of Algiers and Naples.CDD had no immediate comment, but in less than three hours, public health hobbyists reported similar results in other cities, complete with contagion maps.The epidemic was at least one week old, probably originating in Central Africa, beyond the scope of hobbyist surveillance.By the time CDD got its public relations act together, the disease had been detected in India and North America.Worse yet, a journalist in Seattle had isolated and identified the infectious agent, which turned out to be a Pseudomimivirus.That was about as embarrassing a twist as the public relations people could imagine: Back in the late teens, CDD had justified its enormous budget with a brilliant defense against the New Sunrise cult.The Sunrise Plague had been the second worst Euro terror of the decade.Only CDD's leadership had kept the disaster from spreading worldwide.The Sunrise Plague had been based on a Pseudomimivirus.There were still good people at CDD.They were the same specialists who had saved the world in 2017.They quickly resolved the July 23 issue.Public Relations could now spin a more or less accurate statement: Yes, this Pseudomimi had evaded the standard announcement protocols.The failure was a simple software error at the Center's "Current Events" website.And yes, this Pseudomimi might be a derivative of the Sunrise Plague.Denatured strains of the original, death optimized, virus continued to echo around the world, a permanent addition to the background noise of the biosphere.Three had already been sighted that year, one just five days before, on July 18.Furthermore (and here the public relations people regained their usual elan), all such events were subclinical, having essentially no perceptible symptoms.The Pseudomimiviruses had an enormous genome (well, enormous for a virus, small for almost anything else).The New Sunrise cult had transformed that genome into a Swiss Army knife of death, with a tool to counter almost every defense.But without such optimization, the Pseudomimis were clunky bags of DNA junk."And so, in conclusion, we at CDD apologize for failing to announce this routine event. "A week passed.Two weeks.There were no further captures of the organism.Antibody surveys showed that the epidemic never got much farther than the rim of the Mediterranean.CDD's claims for the outbreak were absolutely correct.This kind of "subclinical respiratory epidemic" was almost a contradiction in terms.If not one victim in a thousand even gets the sniffles, the virus is almost dependent on charity to make its way in the world.The CDD explanations were accepted.The public health hobbyists had been scaremongering a commonplace event.In fact, there was only one misrepresentation in the CDD story, and that successfully eluded public notice: The failure to announce the virus had not been a mess up at the public website.Instead, it had been a glitch in the Center's just revised internal alert system.So the responsible specialists had been as ignorant of the event as the general public; it was the hobbyists who had alerted both.In the inner circles of EU intelligence, there were people who were not forgiving of such lapses.These were people who countered terror on a daily basis.These were people whose greatest successes were things you never heard about  and whose failures could be bigger than the Sunrise Plague.Understandably, these people were both paranoid and obsessive.The EU Intelligence Board assigned one of its brightest agents, a young German named Gnberk Braun, to oversee a quiet reorganization at CDD.In those parts of intelligence where Braun was known, he was somewhat famous  as the most obsessing of the obsessive.In any case, he and his teams quickly revamped the internal reporting structure of the CDD, then undertook a Center wide review that was to last six months and consist of random "fire drills" that would probe threats and conjectures more bizarre than the epidemiologists had ever imagined.For CDD, those six months promised to be a torment for the incompetent and a revelation for the brilliant.But Braun's fire drill regime lasted less than two months, and was ended by an advertisement at a soccer match.The first meeting of the Greece Pakistan Football Series was held in Lahore on September 20.The Greece Pakistan Series had some tradition behind it  or perhaps the supporters were just old fashioned.In any case, the advertising was very much a blundering, twentieth century affair.There were commercials where each advert was seen by everyone.Display space was sold on the inner barricades of the stadium, but even that was not targeted per viewer.A remarkable thing happened at the match (two remarkable things, if you count the fact that Greece won).At halftime a thirty second advert for honeyed nougats was shown.Within the hour, several freelance marketing analysts reported a spike surge of nougat sales, beginning three minutes after the advert.That single advertisement had repaid its sponsor one hundred times over.Such was the stuff of dreams  at least for those unwhole somely fixated on the marketing arts.Throughout the afternoon, these millions debated the remarkable event.The advertisement was analyzed in every detail.It was an uninspired thing, quite in keeping with the third rate company that produced it.Importantly, it contained no subliminal messing about (though finding such was the main hope of those who studied it).The delay and abruptness of the surge were quite unlike a normal advertisement response.Within hours, all reasonable participants agreed that the Honeyed Nougat Miracle was just the kind of mirage that came from modern data dredging capabilities: if you watch trillions of things, you will often see one in a million coincidences.At the end of the day, the whole affair had canceled itself out, just another tiny ripple in the myriad conversations of public life.Certain observers did not lose interest.Gnberk Braun, like most in the inner circles of the EUIB, had an enormous (let's be frank: an apprehensive) respect for the power of open intelligence analysis.One of his teams noticed the Honeyed Nougat Miracle.They considered the discussion.True, the event was almost surely a mirage.And yet, there were additional questions that could be asked; some were questions that governments had a special knack for answering.And that brings us to the second bit of dumb luck.On a whim, Braun called for a fire drill: the analytical resources of the CDD would be pointed at the public health significance of the Honeyed Nougat Miracle.Whatever the practical content of the mystery, this would exercise the Center in the conduct of a secret, real time, emergency investigation.At that, it wasn't much crazier than his previous drills.By now, the brighter of the CDD's specialists were very much in the swing of such festivities.They quickly generated a thousand conjectures and imagined half a million tests.These would be seeds for the search trees of the investigation.Over the next two days, the CDD analysts proceeded down their trees, extending and pruning  all the time exercising statistical restraint; this sort of work could generate more mirages than the marketing hobbyists had ever dreamed.Just the topic list would fill an old time phone book.Here are the good parts, dramatically arranged:  There was no connection between the buying surge and the honeyed nougat advert.This conclusion was not based upon theoretical analysis: CDD showed the advertisement to small response groups.All of the half time publicity was similarly tested.One of the stadium displays  an advertisement for a dating service, which had aired only briefly  caused occasional interest in nougats.(The dating service advert was a bit of design artist excess, its background of intersecting lines a distracting moire pattern. )Proceeding down the test tree, the dating service advertisement was played for a number of specialized audiences.For instance, it had no enhanced effect on persons with antibodies to the July 23 Pseudomimi virus.The dating service advertisement did provoke nougat lust when shown to those who'd been infected by the earlier, July 18 Pseudomimi, the one that CDD had properly reported .As a child, Gnberk Braun had often daydreamed of how, in an earlier time, he might have prevented the firebombing of Dresden, or stopped the Nazis and their death camps, or kept Stalin from starving the Ukraine.On off days, when he couldn't move nations, little Gnberk imagined what he might have done in 1941 December 7 at a radar outpost in Hawaii, or as an American FBI agent in the summer of 2001.Perhaps all young boys go through such a phase, largely ignorant of historical context, simply wanting to be savior heroes.But when Braun considered this latest report, he knew he was in the middle of something as big as his childhood fantasies.The July 18 Pseudomimi and the advertising at the football match  together they amounted to an extremely well disguised test of a new weapon concept.In its developed form, such a weapon would make the Sunrise Plague look like a malignant toy.At the least, biological warfare would become as precise and surprising as bullets and bombs: slyly infect a population with the slow random spread of disease, all but undetected, and then bam , blind or maim or kill  singly with an email, or by the billions with a broadcast, too quickly for any possible "defense against disease. "If Braun had been a CDD person, this discovery would have precipitated immediate alarums to all the disease defense organizations of the Indo European Alliance, as well as to the CDC in America and the CDCP in China.But Gnberk Braun was not an epidemiologist.He was a spook, and he was paranoid even for that.Braun's fire drill was under his personal control; he had no trouble suppressing the news there.Meantime, he used his resources in the EUIB and the Indo European Alliance.Within hours, he was deep into a number of projects:  He brought in the best cult expert in the Indo European intelligence community and set her loose on the evidence.He reached out to the military assets of the Alliance, in Central Africa and all the failed states at the edge of the modern world.There were solid clues about the origin of the July 18 Pseudomimi.Though this research was not bioscientific, Braun's analysts were very similar to the best at CDD  only smarter, more numerous, with far deeper resources.Even so, they were lucky: over the next three days, they put two and two (and two and two and two) together.In the end, he had a good idea who was behind the weapons test.And for the first time in his life, Gnberk Braun was truly terrified.01.Mr.Rabbit Visits Barcelona  Within the intelligence services of the Indo European Alliance, there were a handful of bureaucratic superstars, people such as Gnberk Braun of the EUIB.Hopefully, their identities were unknown  or a mass of contradictions  to the general public.The superstars had their own heroes.In particular, when people like Gnberk Braun were confronted with the most desperate problems, there was a place to get help.There was a certain department in India's External Intelligence Agency.It didn't show up in EIA organization charts, and its purpose was happily undefined.Basically, it was whatever its boss thought it should be.That boss was an Indian national known (to those very few who knew of him at all) as Alfred Vaz.Braun took his terrifying discovery to Vaz.At first, the older man was as taken aback as Braun himself had been.But Vaz was a fixer."With the proper human resources, you can solve almost any problem," he said."Give me a few days.Let's see what I can dig up. "In downtown Barcelona, three days later:  The rabbit hopped onto the unoccupied wicker chair and thence to the middle of the table, between the teacups and the condiments.It tipped its top hat first at Alfred Vaz and then at Gnberk Braun and Keiko Mitsuri."Have I got a deal for you!"it said.Altogether, it was an unremarkable example of its type.Alfred reached out and swiped his hand through the image, just to emphasize his own substance."We're the ones with the deal. ""Hmph. "The rabbit plunked its ass down on the table and pulled a tiny tea service out from behind the salt and pepper.It poured itself a drop or two  enough to fill its cup  and took a sip."I'm all ears. "It wiggled two long ones to emphasize the point.From the other side of the table, Gnberk Braun gave the creature a long stare.Braun was as ephemeral as the rabbit, but he projected a dour earnestness that was quite consistent with his real personality.Alfred thought he detected a certain surprised disappointment in the younger man's expression.In fact, after a moment, Gnberk sent him a silent message.Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>This is the best you could recruit, Alfred?</sm>  Alfred didn't reply directly.Instead, he turned to the creature sitting on the table."Welcome to Barcelona, Mr.Rabbit," he said.He waved at the towers of the Sagrada Familia, which soared up and up from just across the street.The cathedral was best seen without virtual elaboration; after all, the reality of Gaudi architecture was gaudy beyond the imagination of modern revisionists."Do you have any idea why we selected this location for our meeting?"The rabbit sipped its tea.Its gaze slid in a very un rabbity way to take in the noisy crowds that swept past the tables, to scan the costumes and body plans of tourists and locals."Ah, is it that Barcelona is a place for the beautiful and the bizarre, one of the few great cities of the twentieth century whose charm survives in the modern world?Could it be that on the side, you and your families are taking touchy feely tours through Pare Gell and writing it all off on your expense accounts?"He stared at Braun and at Keiko Mitsuri.Mitsuri was frankly masked.She looked a bit like Marcel Duchamp's nude, built from a shifting complex of crystal planes.The rabbit shrugged."But then again, maybe you two are thousands of kilometers away. "Keiko laughed."Oh, don't be so indecisive," she said, speaking with a completely synthetic accent and syntax."I'm quite happy to be in Pare Gell right now, feeling reality with my very own real hands. "Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>In fact, I'm in my office, admiring the moonlight on Tokyo Bay.</sm>  The rabbit continued, ignorant of the silent messaging byplay: "Whatever.In any case, the real reasons for meeting here: Barcelona has very direct connections to wherever you're really from, and modern security to disguise what we say.Best of all, it has laws banning popular and police snooping unless of course you are the EU Intelligence Board. "Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Well, that's one third of a correct guess.</sm>  Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Mr.Rabbit himself is calling from some distance.</sm> An EU real time estimate hung in the air above the little creature's head: seventy five percent probability that the mind behind the rabbit image was in North America.Alfred leaned toward the rabbit and smiled.As the agent with physical presence, Vaz had limitations  but some advantages, too."No, we're not the secret police.And yes, we wanted some secure communication that was a bit more personal than text messaging. "He tapped his chest."In particular, you see me physically here.It builds trust. "And should give you all sorts of invalid clues .Vaz waved to a waiter, ordered a glass of Rioja.Then, turning back to the creature on the tablecloth: "In recent months, you have bragged many things, Mr.Rabbit.Others brag similarly nowadays, but you have certificates that are difficult to come by.Various people with notable reputations have endorsed your abilities. "The rabbit preened.This was a rabbit with many implausible mannerisms.Physical realism did not rank high in its priorities."Of course I am highly recommended.For any problem, political, military, scientific, artistic, or amorous  meet my terms, and I will deliver. "Mitsuri  > Braun, Vaz: <sm>Go ahead, Alfred.</sm> Braun  > Mitsuri, Vaz: <sm>Yes, the minimal version of course.Nothing more till we see some results that we couldn't make for ourselves.</sm>  Alfred nodded as if to himself."Our problem has nothing to do with politics or war, Mr.Rabbit.We have only some scientific interests. "The rabbit ears waggled."So?Post your needs to the answer boards.That may get you results almost as good as mine, almost as fast.And for certain, a thousand times cheaper. "Wine arrived.Vaz made a thing of sniffing the bouquet.He glanced across the street.The bidding on physical tour slots to the Sagrada Familia was closed for the day, but there was still a queue of people near the cathedral entrance, people hoping for no shows.It proved once again that the most important things were those you could touch.He looked back at the gray rabbit."We have needs that are more basic than picking the brains of a few thousand analysts.Our questions require serious, um, experimentation.Some of that has already been done.Much remains.All together, our project is the size you might imagine for a government crash research program. "The rabbit grinned, revealing ivory incisors."Heh.A government crash program?That's twentieth century foolishness.Market demands are always more effective.You just have to fool the market into cooperating. ""Maybe.But what we want to do is" The hell of it was, even the cover story was extreme."What we want is, um, administrative authority at a large physical laboratory. "The rabbit froze, and for an instant it looked like a real herbivore, one suddenly caught in a bright light."Oh?What kind of physical lab?""Globally integrated life sciences. ""Well, well, well. "Rabbit sat back, communing with itself  hopefully with itself alone.EU Intelligence set a sixty five percent probability that Rabbit was not sharing the big picture with others, ninety five percent that it was not a tool of China or the U. S. A.  Alfred's own organization in India was even more confident of these assumptions.The rabbit set down his teacup."I'm intrigued.So this is not an information provision job.You really want me to subvert a major installation. ""Just for a short time," said Gnberk."Whatever.You've come to the right fellow. "Its nose quivered."I'm sure you know the possibilities.In Europe there are a scattering of top institutions, but none is totally integrated  and for now they remain in the backwash of sites in China and the U. S. A. "Vaz didn't nod, but the rabbit was right.There were brilliant researchers the world over, but only a few data intensive labs.In the twentieth century, technical superiority of major labs might last thirty years.Nowadays, things changed faster, but Europe was a little behind.The Bhopal complex in India was more integrated, but lagging in micro automation.It might be several years before China and the U. S. A.  lost their current edge.The rabbit was chuckling to itself: "Hm, hm.So it must be either the labs in Wuhan or those in Southern California.I could work my miracles with either, of course. "That was a lie, or else Alfred's people had totally misjudged this fine furry friend.Keiko said, "We'd prefer the biotech complex in San Diego, California. "Alfred had a smooth explanation ready: "We've studied the San Diego labs for some months.We know they have the resources we need. "In fact, San Diego was where Gnberk Braun's terrible suspicions were focused."Just what are you planning?"Gnberk gave a sour smile."Let us proceed by installments, Mr.Rabbit.For the first installment, we suggest a thirty day deadline.We'd like from you a survey of the San Diego labs' security.More important, we need credible evidence that you can provide a team of local people to carry out physical acts in and near those labs. ""Well then.I will hop right on it. "The rabbit rolled its eyes."It's obvious you're looking for an expendable player, somebody to shield your operation from the Americans.Okay.I can be a cutout.But be warned.I am very pricey and I will be around to collect afterwards. "Keiko laughed."No need to be melodramatic, Mr.Rabbit.We know of your famous skills. ""Quite right!But so far you don't believe in them.Now I'll go away, sniff around San Diego, and get back to you in a couple of weeks.I'll have something to show you by then, and  more important for me  I'll have used my enormous imagination to specify a first payment in this installment plan that Mr.So German Seeming has proposed. "He gave a little bow in Gnberk's direction.Mitsuri and Braun were radiating bemused silence, so it was Alfred who carried on the conversation."We'll chat again then.Please remember that for now we want a survey only.We want to know whom you can recruit and how you might use them. "The rabbit touched its nose."I will be the soul of discretion.I always know much more than I reveal.But you three really should improve your performances.Mr.So German is just an out of date stereotype.And you, senora, the work of impressionist art reveals nothing and everything.Who might have a special interest in the San Diego bio labs?Who indeed?And as for you  " Rabbit looked at Vaz."That's a fine Colombian accent you're hiding. "The creature laughed and hopped off the table."Talk to you soon. "Alfred leaned back and watched the gray form as it dodged between the legs of passersby.It must have a festival permit, since other people were evidently seeing the creature.There was no poof of vanishment.The rabbit remained visible for twenty meters up Carrer de Sardenya, then darted into an alley and was finally and quite naturally lost to sight.The three agents sat for a moment in apparently companionable silence, Gnberk bent over his virtual wine, Vaz sipping at his real Rioja and admiring the stilted puppets that were setting up for the afternoon parade.The three blended well with the normal touristy hurly burly of the Familia district  except that most tourists paying for caf seating on C.  de Sardenya would have had more than a one third physical presence."He is truly gone," Gnberk said, a bit unnecessarily; they could all see the EU signals analysis.A few more seconds passed.The Japanese and Indian intelligence agencies also reported in: Rabbit remained unidentified."Well that's something," said Keiko."He got away clean.Perhaps he can function as a cutout. "Gnberk gave a weary shrug."Perhaps.What a disgusting twit.His kind of dilettante is a cliche a century old, reborn with each new technology.I wager he's fourteen years old and desperately eager to show off. "He glanced at Vaz."Is this the best you could come up with, Alfred?""His reputation is not a fraud, Gnberk.He has managed projects almost as complex as what we have in mind for him. ""Those were research projects.Perhaps he is a good  what's the term?'weaver of geniuses. 'What we want is more operational. ""Well, he correctly picked up on all of the clues we gave him. "There had been Alfred's accent, and the network evidence they had planted about Keiko's origin."Ach ja ," said Gnberk, and a sudden smile crossed his face."It's a bit humiliating that when I am simply myself, I'm accused of overacting!Yes, so now Mr.Rabbit thinks we are South American drug lords. "The shifting crystal mists that were Keiko's image seemed to smile."In a way, that's more plausible than what we really are. "The heirs of drug wars past had been in eclipse this last decade; access to "ecstasy and enhancement" was so widespread that competition had done what enforcement could never accomplish.But the drug lords were still rich beyond the dreams of most small countries.The ones lurking in failed states might be crazy enough to do what they three had hinted at today.Gnberk said, "The rabbit is manageable, I grant that.Competent for our needs?Much less likely. ""Having second thoughts about our little project, Gnberk?"This was Keiko's real voice.Her tone was light, but Alfred knew she had her own very serious misgivings."Of course," said Gnberk.He fidgeted for a moment."Look.Terror via technical surprise is the greatest threat to the survival of the human race.The Great Powers  ourselves, China, the U. S.   have been at peace for some years, mostly because we recognize that danger and we keep the rest of the world in line.And now we discover that the Americans  "  Keiko: "We don't know it's the Americans, Gnberk.The San Diego labs support researchers all over the world. ""That is so.And a week ago I was as dubious as you.But now consider: The weapons test was a masterpiece of cloaking.We were incredibly lucky to notice it.The test was a work of patience and professionalism, at the level of a Great Power.Great Powers have their own inertia and bureaucratic caution.Field testing must necessarily be done in the outside world, but they do not run their weapons development in labs they do not own. "Keiko made a sound like faraway chimes."But why would a Great Power plot a revolution in plague delivery?What profit is there in that?"Gnberk nodded."Yes, such destruction would make sense for a cult, but not for a superpower.At first, my conclusion was a nightmare without logic.But my analysts have been over this again and again.They've concluded that the 'honeyed nougat symptom' was not simply a stand in for lethal disease.In fact, it was an essential feature of the test.This enemy is aiming at something greater than instant biowarfare strikes.This enemy is close to having an effective YGBM technology. "Keiko was completely silent; even her crystals lost their mobility.YGBM.That was a bit of science fiction jargon from the turn of the century: You Gotta Believe Me.That is, mind control.Weak, social forms of YGBM drove all human history.For more than a hundred years, the goal of irresistible persuasion had been a topic of academic study.For thirty years it had been a credible technological goal.And for ten, some version of it had been feasible in well controlled laboratory settings.The crystals shifted; Alfred could tell that Keiko was looking at him."Can this be true, Alfred?""Yes, I'm afraid so.My people have studied the report.Gnberk's luck was extraordinary, since this was really a simultaneous test of two radical innovations.The honeyed nougat compulsion was far more precise than needed for a test of remote disease triggering.The perpetrators knew what they were coding for  consider the cloaking advertisement for nougats.My analysts think the enemy may be capable of higher semantic control in as little as a year. "Keiko sighed."Damn.All my life, I've fought the cults.I thought the great nations were beyond the most monstrous evils but this, this would make me wrong. "Gnberk nodded."If we are right about these labs and if we fail to properly deal with them, that could be the end of history.It could be the end of all the striving for good against evil that has ever been. "He shook himself, abruptly returning to the practical."And yet we are reduced to working through this damned rabbit person. "Alfred said gently, "I've studied Rabbit's track record, Gnberk.I think he can do what we need.One way or another.He'll get us the inside information, or he'll create enough chaos  not attributable to us  that any evil will be clearly visible.If the worst is true, we'll have evidence that we and China and even the nonculpable parties in the U. S. A.  can use to stamp this out. "Suppression attacks on the territory of a Great Power were rare, but there was precedent.All three were silent for a moment, and the sounds of the festival afternoon swept around Vaz.It had been so many years since his last visit to Barcelona Finally, Gnberk gave a grudging nod."I'll recommend to my superiors that we proceed. "Across the table, Keiko's prismatic imagery shimmered and chimed.Mitsuri's background was in sociology.Her analyst teams were heavily into psychology and social institutions  much less diversified than the teams working for Alfred, or Gnberk.But maybe she would come up with some alternative that the other two had missed.Finally she spoke: "There are many decent people in the American intelligence community.I don't like doing this behind their back.And yet, this is an extraordinary situation.I have clearance to go ahead with Plan Rabbit  " she paused "  with one proviso.Gnberk fears that we've erred in the direction of employing an incompetent.Alfred has studied Rabbit more, and thinks he's at just the right level of talent.But what if you are both wrong?"Gnberk started in surprise."The devil !"he said.Alfred guessed that some very quick silent messaging passed between the two.The prisms seemed to nod."Yes.What if Rabbit is significantly more competent than we think?In that unlikely event, Rabbit might hijack the operation, or even ally with our hypothetical enemy.If we proceed, we must develop abort and destroy plans to match Rabbit's progress.If he becomes the greater threat, we must be prepared to talk to the Americans.Agreed?""Ja.  ""Of course. "Keiko and Gnberk stayed a few minutes more, but a real caf table on C.  de Sardenya in the middle of the festival was not the proper place for virtual tourists.The waiter kept circling back, inquiring if Alfred needed anything more.They were paying table rent for three, but there were crowds of real people waiting for the next available seating.So his Japanese and European colleagues took their leave.Gnberk had many loose ends to deal with.The inquiries at CDD must be gracefully shut down.Misinformation must be layered carefully about, concealing things both from the enemy and from security hobbyists.Meantime, in Tokyo, Keiko might be up the rest of the night, pondering Rabbit traps.Vaz stayed behind, finishing his drink.It was amazing how fast his table space shrank, accommodating a family of North African tourists.Alfred was used to virtual artifacts changing in a blink of the eye, but a clever restaurateur could do almost as well with physical reality when there was money involved.In all Europe, Barcelona was the city Alfred loved the most.The Rabbit was right about this city.But was there time to be a real tourist?Yes.Call it his annual vacation.Alfred stood and bowed to the table, leaving payment and tip.Out on the street, the crowds were getting rather extreme, the stilt people dancing wildly about among the tourists.He couldn't see the entrance of the Sagrada Familia directly, but tourism info showed the next certain tour slot was ninety minutes away.Where to spend his time?Ah!Atop Montjuc.He turned down an alley.Where he emerged on the far side, the crowds were thin and a tourist auto was just arriving for him.Alfred sat back in the single passenger cockpit and let his mind roam.The Montjuc fortress was not the most impressive in Europe, and yet he had not seen it in some time.Like its brethren, it marked the bygone time when revolutions in destruction technology took decades to unfold, and mass murder could not be committed with the press of a button.The auto navigated its way out from the octagonal city blocks of the Barcelona basin and ran quickly up a hillside, grabbing the latch of a funicular that dragged them swiftly up the side of Montjuc.No tedious switchback roadway for this piece of automation.Behind him, the city stretched for miles.And then ahead, as they came over the crest of the hill, there was the Mediterranean, all blue and hazy and peaceful.Alfred got out, and the tiny auto whipped around the traffic circle, heading for the cable car installation that would take its next customer in an overflight across the harbor.He was at just the spot he had ordered on the tourist menu, right where twentieth century guns faced out from the battlements.Even though these cannon had never been used, they were very much the real thing.For a fee, he could touch the guns and climb around inside the place.After sundown there would be a staged battle.Vaz strolled to the stone barrier and looked down.If he blocked out all the tourism fantasy, he could see the freight harbor almost two hundred meters below and a kilometer away.The place was an immensity of freight containers rambling this way and that, chaos.If he invoked his government powers, he could see the flow of cargo, even see the security certificates that proclaimed  in ways that were validated by a combination of physical and cryptographic security  that none of the ten meter boxes contained a nuke or a plague or a garden variety radiation bomb.The system was very good, the same as you would find for heavy freight anywhere in the civilized world.It had been the result of decades of fear, of changing attitudes about privacy and liberty, of technological progress.Modern security actually worked most of the time.There hadn't been a city lost in more than five years.Every year, the civilized world grew and the reach of lawlessness and poverty shrank.Many people thought that the world was becoming a safer place.Keiko and Gnberk  and certainly Alfred  knew that such optimism was dead wrong.Alfred looked across the harbor at the towers beyond.Those hadn't been here the last time he visited Barcelona.The civilized world was wealthy beyond the dreams of his youth.Back in the 1980s and 1990s, the rulers of modern states realized that success did not come from having the largest armies or the most favorable tariffs or the most natural resources  or even the most advanced industries.In the modern world, success came from having the largest possible educated population and providing those hundreds of millions of creative people with credible freedom.But this Utopia was a Red Queen's Race with extinction.In the twentieth century, only a couple of nations had the power to destroy the world.The human race survived, mostly by good luck.At the turn of the century, a time was in view when dozens of countries could destroy civilization.But by then, the Great Powers had a certain amount of good sense.No nation state could be nuts enough to blow up the world  and the few barbaric exceptions were Dealt With, if necessary with methods that left land aglow in the dark.By the teens, mass death technology was accessible to regional and racial hate groups.Through a succession of happy miracles  some engineered by Alfred himself  the legitimate grievances of disaffected peoples were truly addressed.Nowadays, Grand Terror technology was so cheap that cults and small criminal gangs could acquire it.That was where Keiko Mitsuri was the greatest expert.Even though her work was hidden by cover stories and planted lies, Keiko had saved millions of lives.The Red Queen's Race continued.In all innocence, the marvelous creativity of humankind continued to generate unintended consequences.There were a dozen research trends that could ultimately put world killer weapons into the hands of anyone having a bad hair day.Alfred walked back to the nearest cannon, paying the touch fee with a wave of his hand.He leaned against the warm metal, sighting out over the blue mediterranean haze, and imagining a simpler time.Poor Gnberk.He had the truth exactly backwards.Effective YGBM would not be the end of everything.In the right hands, YGBM technology was the one thing that could solve the modern paradox, harnessing the creativity of humankind without destroying the world in the process.In fact, it was humankind's only hope for surviving the twenty first century.And in San Diego, I am so close to success .He had insinuated his project into the bio labs three years earlier.The great breakthrough had come less than a year ago.His test at the soccer match had proven the delivery system.In another year or so, he'd have developed higher semantic controls.With that, he could reliably control those immediately around him.Much more important, he could spread the new infection across whole populations and engineer a few universally viewed transmissions.Then he would be in control.For the first time in history, the world would be under adult supervision.That had been the plan.Now incredibly bad luck had jeopardized it.But I should look at the bright side; Gnberk came to me to fix the problem !Alfred had spent a lot of effort digging up "Mr.Rabbit. "The fellow was clearly inexperienced, and every bit the egotistical fool that Gnberk believed.Rabbit's successes were just barely impressive enough to make him acceptable.They could manage Rabbit.I can manage Rabbit .From inside the labs, Alfred would feed the Rabbit just the right misinformation.In the end neither Rabbit nor Alfred's colleagues in the Indo European Alliance would realize they had been fooled.And afterward, Alfred could continue undisturbed with what might well be the last, best chance for saving the world.Alfred climbed into the gun turret and admired the fittings.The Barcelona tourist commission had spent some real money on rebuilding these artifacts.If their mock battle this evening meshed with this physical reality, it would be very impressive.He glanced at his Mumbai schedule  and decided to stay in Barcelona a few more hours.02.The Return  Robert Gu should be dead.He knew that, he truly did.He had been a long time dying.He wasn't really clear on how long.In this unending present, he could see only blurs.But that didn't matter, since Lena had turned the lights down so low that there was nothing to see.And the sounds: for a while he had worn things in his ears, but they were devilishly complicated and always getting lost or worn out.Getting rid of them had been a blessing.What sounds remained were vague mumblings, sometimes Lena complaining at him, pushing and poking.Following him into the John, for God's sake.All he really wanted was to go home.Lena wouldn't let him do that simple thing.If it really was Lena at all.Whoever, she wasn't very nice.I just want to go home .And yet, he never did quite die.The lights were often brighter now, though blurry as ever.There were people around and voices, the high pitched tones he remembered from home.They talked as if they expected to be understood.Things had been better before, when everything was a mumbling blur.Now he hurt all over.There were long drives to see the doctor, and afterward the pain was always worse.There was some guy who claimed to be his son, and claimed that wherever he was now was home.Sometimes they rolled him outside to feel the bright sun on his face and listen to the birds.No way was this home.Robert Gu remembered home.There had been snow on big mountains he could see from his folks' backyard.Bishop, California, U. S. A.  That was the place, and this wasn't it.But even though this wasn't home, his little sister was here.Cara Gu had been around before, when things were dark and mumbling, but she'd always been just out of sight.This was different.At first he was just aware of her high, piping voice, like the wind bells his mother kept on the porch at home.Finally, one day he was out on the patio, feeling the sunlight brighter and warmer than it had seemed in a long time.Even the blurs were sharp and colorful.There was Cara's high little voice asking him "Robert this" and "Robert that" and   "Robert, would you like it if I showed you around the neighborhood?""What?"Robert's tongue felt all sticky, his voice hoarse.It suddenly occurred to him that with all the mumbling and darkness maybe he hadn't spoken in some time.And there was something else that that was even more strange."Who are you?"There was silence for a moment, as if the question were foolish or had been asked many times before."Robert, I'm Miri.I'm your grand  "  He jerked his hand as much as it would move."Come closer.I can't see you. "The blur moved directly in front of him, into the middle of the sunlight.This was not some hint of presence behind his shoulder or in his memory.The blur became a face just inches from his own: he could see the straight black hair, the small round countenance smiling at him as if he were the greatest guy in the world.It really was his little sister.Robert reached forward, and her hand was warm in his."Oh, Cara.It's so good to see you. "He wasn't home, but maybe he was close.He was quiet for a moment."I'm I'm glad to see you, too, Robert.Would you like to go for a ride around the neighborhood?"" Yes, that would be nice. "Things happened fast then.Cara did something and his chair seemed to spin around.It was dark and gloomy again.They were inside the house and she was fussing like she always did, this time getting him a hat.She still teased though, as in asking him if he needed to go to the bathroom.Robert sensed that the thug who claimed to be his son was lurking just to one side, watching it all.And then they were out  what, the front door?and onto a street.Cara stayed beside his wheelchair as they strolled and rolled down an empty street lined with tall, thin trees palm trees, that's what they were.This wasn't Bishop.But this was Cara Gu  though on her very best behavior.Little Cara was a good kid, but she could only be good for so long and then she would find some devilish tease and have him chasing her all over the house, or vice versa.Robert smiled to himself and wondered how long the angelic phase would last this time.Maybe she thought he was sick.He tried unsuccessfully to turn in his chair.Well, maybe he was sick."See, we live on Honor Court.Over there, that's the Smithsons' house.They transferred here from Guam last month.Bob thinks they're growing five  oops, but I'm not supposed to talk about that.And the boyfriend of the base commander lives in that house by the corner.I'm betting they'll be married by the end of the year And there are some kids from school I don't want to talk to just now. "Robert's wheelchair took an abrupt turn, and they were heading down a side street."Hey!"Robert tried again to turn in his chair.Maybe those kids were friends of his!Cara was teasing after all.He slumped down in the chair.There was the smell of honey.Bushes seemed to hang low above them.The houses were gray and greenish blurs."Some tour!"he groused."I can't see a Dam Ned thing. "The wheelchair abruptly slowed."Really?"The little wretch was all but chortling."Don't worry, Robert!There's some devious twiddling that can fix your eyes. "Grump ."A pair of glasses would fix them, Cara. "Maybe she was hiding them from him.There was something about the brightness and the dry wind that swept these streets  wherever this was.It made him wonder what he was doing tied down to a wheelchair.They toured around a couple more blocks.Cara fussed endlessly over him."Are you too warm, Robert?Maybe you don't need that blanket. ""The sun is going to burn your head, Robert.Let me tilt your cap down a little bit. "At one point there were no houses.It seemed that they were on the edge of a long slope.Cara claimed they were looking off toward the mountains  but all Robert could see was a hazy line of tan and faded ochre.They were nothing like the mountains that shouldered into the sky above Bishop, California, U. S. A.   Then they were back indoors, in the house they had started from.Things were as dark and gloomy as ever, the room lights swallowed up in darkness.Cara's bright voice was gone.She was off to study for her classes, she said.No classes for Robert.The thug was feeding him.He still claimed to be Robert's son.But he was so big.Afterward there was another ignominious potty stop, more like a police interrogation than a trip to the can.And then Robert was left mercifully alone, in the darkness.These people didn't even have television.There was just the silence, and the dim and faraway electric lights.I should be sleepy .He had a vague memory of nights fading off into nights fading off into years, of drowsing sleep that came right after dinner.And then later waking, walking through strange rooms and trying to find home.Arguing with Lena.Tonight was different.He was still awake.Tonight he was thinking of things that had just happened.Maybe that was because he had made it partway home.Cara .So he hadn't found his folks' house on Crombie Street and the bedroom that looked out on the old pine tree and the little cabin he had built in its branches.But Cara was part of all that, and she was here.He sat for a long time, his thoughts slowly crunching forward.Across the room, a single lamp was kind of a whirlpool in the darkness.Barely visible, the thug was sitting by the wall.He was talking to someone, but Robert couldn't see who.Robert ignored the guy, and thought hard.After a while he remembered something very scary.Cara Gu had died in 2006.They hadn't said a word to each other for years before that.And when she died, Cara had been fifty one years old.West Fallbrook had been a handy place in the early years of the century.Busy too.Right next to Camp Pendleton, it had been the base's largest civilian community.A new generation of marines had grown up here and prosecuted a new generation of war.Robert Gu, Jr., had seen the tail end of that frenzy, arriving at a time when Chinese American officers were welcomed back to positions of trust.Those had been high and bittersweet days.Now the town was bigger, but the marines weren't nearly such a large part of it.Military life had become a lot more complicated.Between little bits of war, Lieutenant Colonel Gu found that West Fallbrook was a nice place to raise a daughter."I still think it's a mistake for Miri to call him 'Robert. '"Alice Gu looked up from her work."We've been over this before, dear.It's how we've brought her up.We're 'Bob' and 'Alice,' not 'Ma' and 'Pa' or whatever silliness is currently approved.And Robert is 'Robert,' not 'Grandpapa. '" Colonel Alice Gong Gu was short and round faced and  when she wasn't deadly stressed  motherly.She had graduated numero uno from Annapolis, back when being short and round faced and motherly were definite career minuses.She'd be a general officer by now except that higher authority had discovered more productive and dangerous work for her.That accounted for some of her kookie ideas.But not this one; she had always insisted that Miri address her parents as if they were all just pals."Hey, Alice, I've never minded that Miri calls us by our first names.There'll come a time when besides loving us, the Little General will also be our peer, maybe our boss.But this is just confusing my old man  " Bob jerked a thumb at where Robert Senior sat, half slumped and staring."Play back the way Dad was acting this afternoon.See how he lit up.He thinks Miri is my aunt Cara, when they were little kids!"Alice didn't answer right away.Where she was, it was midmorning.Sunlight glittered off the harbor behind her.She was running support for the U. S.  delegation in Jakarta.Indonesia was joining the Indo European Alliance.Japan was already a member of that bizarrely named club.The joke was that the "Indo Europeans" would soon have the world surrounded.There was a time when China and the U. S. A.  would not have taken that as a joke.But the world had changed.Both China and the U. S.  were relieved by the development.It left them with more time to worry about real problems.Alice's eyes flickered this way and that as she nodded at an introduction, laughed at some witty comment.She walked a short distance with a couple of self important types, chattering all the while in Bahasa and Mandarin and Goodenuf English, of which only the English was intelligible to Bob.Then she was alone again.She leaned a little toward him, and gave him a big grin."Well that sounds like a good thing!"she said."Your father has been beyond all rational discourse for how many years?And now suddenly he's engaged enough to have a good time.You should be thrilled.From here, he'll only get better.You'll have your father back!"" Yes. "Yesterday, he'd said goodbye to the last of the in home caregivers.Dad should improve very fast now.The only reason he was still in a wheelchair was that the docs wanted to make sure his bone regeneration was complete before they let him loose in the neighborhood.She saw the expression on his face, and cocked her head to one side."Are you chicken?"He glanced at his father.The Paraguay operation was just a few weeks away.A covert op at the edge of the world.The prospect was coming to seem almost attractive."Maybe. ""Then let our Little General do her thing and don't worry. "She turned and waved at someone beyond his vision."Oops. "Her image flickered out and there was only silent messaging   Alice  > Bob: <sm>Gotta go.I'm already covering for Secretary Martinez, and local custom does not approve of timesharing.</sm>  Bob sat for a moment in the quiet living room.Miri was upstairs, studying.Outside, the late afternoon slid into evening.A peaceful time.Back when he was a kid, this was when Dad would bring out the poetry books, and Dad and Mom and little Bobby would have a readalong.Actually, Bob felt a happy nostalgia for those evenings.He looked back at his father."Dad?"No answer.Bob leaned forward and tried to shout diffidently."Dad?Is there enough light for you?I can make it lots brighter. "The old man shook his head distractedly.Maybe he even understood the question, but he gave no other indication.He just sat there, slumped to the side.His right hand rubbed again and again at the wrist of his left.And yet, this was a big improvement.Robert Gu, Sr., had been down to eighty pounds, a barely living vegetable, when UCSF Medical School took him on for their new treatment.It turned out the UCSF Alzheimer's cure worked where the years of conventional treatment had failed.Bob did a few errands on base, checked the plans for the upcoming Paraguay operation and then sat back and just watched his father for a few minutes.I didn't always hate you .As a child, he had never hated his old man.Maybe that wasn't surprising.A kid has very little to compare to.Robert was strict and demanding, on that little Bobby had been very clear.For even though Robert Senior had often and loudly blamed himself for being such an easygoing parent, sometimes that seemed to contradict what Bob saw at his friends' homes.But it had never seemed mistreatment to Bob.Even when Mom left Dad, even that hadn't turned Bob against the old man.Lena Gu had taken years of subtle abuse and she couldn't take any more, but little Bobby had been oblivious of it all.It wasn't till later, talking to Aunt Cara, that he realized how much worse Robert treated others than he had ever treated Bob.For Lieutenant Colonel Robert Gu, Jr., this should be a joyous time.His father, one of America's most beloved poets, was returning from an extended campout in the valley of the shadow of death.Bob took a long look at Robert's still, relaxed features.No, if this were cinema, it would be a Western and the title would be The Return of the SOB .03.A Minefield Made in Heaven  "My eyeballs are fizzing!""This shouldn't be painful.Do they actually hurt?"" No. "But the light was so bright that Robert saw fiery color even in the shadows."It's all still a blur, but I haven't seen this well in" he didn't know how long; time itself had been a darkness " in years. "A woman spoke from right behind his shoulder."You've been on the retinal meds for about a week, Robert.Today we felt we had a working population of cells present, so we decided to turn them on. "Another woman's voice: "And we can cure your blurred vision even more easily.Reed?""Yes, Doctor. "This voice came from the man shaped blur directly in front of him.The figure leaned near."Let me put this over your eyes, Robert.There'll be a little numbness. "Big gentle hands slipped glasses across Robert's face.At least this was familiar; he was getting new lenses fitted.But then his face went numb and he couldn't close his eyes."Just relax and look to the front. "Relaxing was one thing, but there was no choice about looking to the front.And then God , it was like watching a picture come up on a really slow computer, the blurs sharpening into finer and finer detail.Robert would have jerked back, but the numbness had spread to his neck and shoulders."The cell map in the right retina looks good.Let's do the left. "A few more seconds passed, and there was a second miracle.The man sitting in front of him eased the "glasses" off Robert's head.There was a smile on his middle aged face.He wore a white cotton shirt.The pocket was embroidered with blue stitching: "Physician's Assistant Reed Weber. "I can see every thread of it !He looked over the man's shoulder.The walls of the clinic were slightly out of focus.Maybe he'd have to wear glasses out of doors.The thought set him laughing.And then he recognized the pictures on the walls.This was not a clinic.Those wall hangings were the calligraphy that Lena had bought for their house in Palo Alto.Where am I ?There was a fireplace; there were sliding glass doors that opened onto a lawn.Not a book in sight; this was no place he had ever lived.The numbness in his shoulders was almost gone.Robert looked around the room.The two female voices  they weren't attached to anything visible.But Reed Weber wasn't the only person in sight.A heavyset fellow stood on his left, arms akimbo, a broad smile on his face.Robert's look caught his, and the smile faltered.The man gave him a nod and said, "Dad. "" Bob. "It wasn't so much that memory suddenly returned as that he noticed a fact that had been there all along.Bobby had grown up."I'll talk to you later, Dad.For now I'll let you wrap things up with Dr.Aquino and her people. "He nodded at the thin air by Robert's right shoulder  and left the room.The thin air said, "Actually, Robert, that's about all we intended to do today.You have a lot to do over the next few weeks, but it will be less chaotic if we take things one step at a time.We'll be keeping watch for any problems. "Robert pretended to see something in the air."Right.See you around. "He heard friendly laughter."Quite right!Reed can help you with that. "Reed Weber nodded, and now Robert had the feeling that he and Weber were truly alone in the room.The physician's assistant packed away the glasses, and various other pieces of loose equipment.Most were plain plastic boxes, prosaic throwaways except for the miracles they had made.Weber noticed his look, and smiled."Just tools of the trade, the humdrum ones.It's the meds and machines that are floating around inside you that are really interesting. "He stowed the last of the bricklike objects and looked up."You're a very lucky guy, do you know that?"I am in daylight now, where before it was night since forever.I wonder where Lena is ?Then he thought about the other's question."How do you mean?""You picked all the right diseases!"He laughed."Modern medicine is kind of like a minefield made in heaven.We can cure a lot of things: Alzheimer's, even though you almost missed the boat there.You and I both had Alzheimer's; I had the normal kind, cured at earliest onset.Lots of other things are just as fatal or crippling as ever.We still can't do much with strokes.Some cancers can't be cured.There are forms of osteoporosis that are as gruesome as ever.But all your major infirmities are things we have slam dunk fixes for.Your bones are as good as a fifty year old's now.Today we did your eyes.In a week or so we'll start reinforcing your peripheral nervous system. "Reed laughed."You know, you've even got the skin and fat biochemistry that responds to Venn Kurasawa treatments.It's not one person in a thousand who steps on that heavenly landmine; you're even going to look a lot younger. ""Next you'll be having me playing video games. ""Ah!"Weber reached into his equipment bag and pulled out a slip of paper."We can't forget that. "Robert took the paper and unfolded it all the way.It was really quite large, almost the size of foolscap.This appeared to be letterhead stationery.At the top was a logo, and in a fancy font the words "Crick's Clinic, Geriatrics Division. "The rest was some kind of outline, the main categories being: "Microsoft Family,"  "Great Wall Linux," and "Epiphany Lite. ""Eventually you'll want to use 'Epiphany Lite,' but in the meantime, just touch the computer type you're most familiar with. "The items listed under "Microsoft Family" were the brand names of Microsoft systems all the way back to the 1980s.Robert stared uncertainly."Robert?You  you do know about computers, right?""Yes. "The memory was there, now that he thought about it.He grinned."But I was always the last to get on board.I got my first PC in 2000. "And that was because the rest of the English Department was brutalizing him for not reading his email."Whew.Okay, you can imitate any of those old styles with that.Just lay it out flat on the arm of your chair.Your son has this room set to play the audio, but most places you'll have to keep your fingers touching the page if you want to hear output. "Robert leaned forward to get a close view of the paper.It didn't glow; it didn't even have the glassy appearance of a computer display.It was just plain, high quality paper.Reed pointed at the outline items."Now press the menu option that corresponds to your favorite system. "Robert shrugged.Over the years, the department had upgraded through a number of systems, but  he pressed his finger to the line of text that said "WinME. "There was no pause, none of the boot up delays he recalled.But suddenly a familiar and annoying musical jingle was in the air.It seemed to come from all around, not from the piece of paper.Now the page was full of color and icons.Robert was filled with nostalgia, remembering many frustrating hours spent in front of glowing computer screens.Reed grinned."A good choice.WinME has been a simple rental for a long time.If you picked Epiphany, we'd be whacking through their licensing jungle Okay, now the rest should be almost exactly what you know.Crick's Clinic even has some of the modern services filtered down so they look like browser sites.This isn't quite as good as what your son and I use, but you won't have any more trouble with 'invisible voices'; you'll see Rachel and Dr.Aquino on the page here, if you want.Be cool, Robert. "Robert listened to Weber's mix of probably dated slang and tech talk, to the joviality and the phrase structures that might suggest sarcasm.Once upon a time, all that would have been enough for Robert to calibrate this fellow.Today, just out of the murk of senility, he couldn't be sure.So he probed a little."I'm all young again?"Reed sat back, and gave an easy laugh."Wish I could tell you that, Robert.You're seventy five years old, and there are a lot more ways for the body to break down than the MDs have even imagined.But I've been on your case for six months.You've come back from the dead, man.You've almost got the Alzheimer's licked.It makes sense to try these other treatments on you now.You're going to have some surprises, mostly for the good.Just take it easy, roll with the punches.For instance, I noticed that you recognized your son just now. ""Y Yes. ""I was here just a week ago.You didn't recognize him then. "It was strange to poke into that dimness, but "Yes.I knew I couldn't have a son.I wasn't old enough.I just wanted to go home, I mean to my parents' home in Bishop.And even now, I was surprised to see that Bob is so old. "Consequences were crashing down upon him."So my parents are dead  "  Reed nodded."I'm afraid so, Robert.There's a whole lifetime that you're going to start remembering. ""As a patchwork?Or oldest memories first?Or maybe I'll get stuck at some point  "  "The MDs can give you the best answers on that. "Reed hesitated."Look, Robert.You used to be a professor, right?"I was a poet !But he didn't think Reed would appreciate which was the more valued rank."Yes.Professor  well, Professor Emeritus  of English.At Stanford. ""Okay then.You were a smart guy.You have a lot to learn, but I'm betting you'll get those smarts back.Don't panic if you can't remember something.Don't push too hard, either.Practically every day the docs are going to restore some additional capability.The theory is that this will be less disturbing for you.Whether that's right or wrong won't matter if you keep cool.Remember you have a whole loving family here. "Lena .Robert lowered his head for a moment.Not a return to childhood, but a kind of second chance.If he could come all the way back from the Alzheimer's, if, if then he might have another twenty years left, time to make up for what he had lost.So two goals: his poetry, and "Lena. "Reed leaned closer."What did you say, sir?"Robert looked up."My wife.I mean my ex wife. "He tried to remember more."I bet I'll never remember what happened after I lost my marbles. ""Like I say, don't worry about it. ""I remember being married to Lena and raising Bobby.We split up years ago.But then I also remember her being with me when the Alzheimer's really started to shut me down.And now she's gone again.Where is she, Reed?"Reed frowned, then leaned forward and zipped up his equipment case."I'm sorry, Robert.She passed away two years ago. "He stood and gave Robert a gentle pat on the shoulder."You know, I think we've made really good progress today.Now I've got to run. "In his former life, Robert Gu had paid even less attention to technology than he had to current events.Human nature doesn't change, and as a poet his job was to distill and display that unchanging essence.Now well, I'm back from the dead !That was something new under the sun, a bit of technology somewhat too large to ignore.It was a new chance at life, a chance to continue his career.And where he should continue his art was obvious: with Secrets of the Ages .He had spent five years on the cantos of that sequence, poems such as "Secrets of the Child,"  "Secrets of the Young Lovers,"  "Secrets of the Old. "But his "Secrets of the Dying" had been an arrant fake, written before he really started to die  no matter that people seemed to think it was the most profound canto of the sequence.But now yes, something new: "Secrets of the One Who Came Back. "The ideas were coming and surely verse would follow.Every day there were new changes in himself, and old barriers suddenly removed.He could easily accept Reed Weber's advice to be patient with his limitations.So much was changing and all for the better.One day he was walking again, even if it was a lurching, unstable gait.He fell three times that first day, and each time, he just bounced back to his feet."Unless you fall on your head, Professor, you'll be fine," Reed said.But his walking got steadily better.And now that he could see  really see  he could do things with his hands.No more pawing around in the dark.He had never realized how important sight was to coordination.There are uncountable ways that things can lie and tangle and hide in three dimensions; without vision you're condemned to compromise and failure.But not me.Not now .And two days after that   he was playing Ping Pong with his granddaughter.He remembered the table.It was the one that he'd bought for little Bobby thirty years ago.He even remembered Bob taking it off his hands when he finally gave up his home in Palo Alto.Today Miri was pulling her punches, lobbing the ball high and slow across the table.Robert moved back and forth.Seeing the ball was no problem, but he had to be very careful or he'd swing too high.Careful, careful went the game  until Miri had him down fifteen to eleven.And then he won five points, each stroke a kind of spastic twitch that somehow smashed the white plastic into the far edge of the table."Robert!You were just fooling me!"Poor, pudgy Miri raced from one corner of the table to the other, trying to keep up with him.Robert's slams had no spin, but she wasn't an expert player.Seventeen to fifteen, eighteen, nineteen.Then his powerful swings got out of tune, and he was back to being a staggering spastic.But now his granddaughter showed no mercy.She racked up six straight points  and won the game.And then she ran around the table to hug him."You are great!But you'll never fool me again!"It didn't do any good to tell her what Aquino had said, that the reconstruction of his nervous system would cause randomly spiky performance.He might end up with the reflexes of an athlete; more likely the endpoint would be something like average coordination.It was funny, how he paid attention to the day of the week.That had stopped mattering even before he lost his marbles.But now, on the weekends, his granddaughter was around all day."What was Great Aunt Cara like?"she asked him one Saturday morning."She was a lot like you, Miri. "The girl's smile was sudden and wide and proud.Robert had guessed that this was what she wanted to hear.But it's true, except that Cara was never overweight .Miri was like Cara, right in those last years of preadolescence when her hero worship for her older brother had been replaced by other concerns.If anything, Miri's personality was an exaggeration of Cara's.Miri was very bright  probably smarter than her great aunt.And Miri was already into the extreme independence and moral certainty of the other.I remember that persistent arrogance , thought Robert.That had been an enormous irritation; breaking her of it had been what drove them apart.Sometimes Miri had her little friends over.The boys and girls mixed pretty indescriminately at this age and in this era.For a few brief years they were almost matched for muscle.Miri loved to play doubles at Ping Pong.He had to smile at the way she bossed her friends around.She had them organized into a tournament.And though she was scrupulously honest, she played to win .When her side got behind, her jaw set in angry determination, and there was steel in her eyes.Afterward she was quick to acknowledge her own failures, and just as quick to critique her playmates.Even when her friends were gone physically, they were often still around, invisible presences like Robert's doctors.Miri walked around the backyard talking and arguing with nobody  a parody of all the cellphone discourtesy that Robert remembered from his later years at Stanford.Then there were Miri's grand silences.Those didn't match anything in his recollection of Cara.Miri would push gently back and forth on the swing that hung from the only good sized tree in the backyard.She would do that for hours , speaking only occasionally  and then to the empty air.Her eyes seemed to be focused miles away.And when he asked her what she was doing, she would start and laugh and say that she was "studying. "It looked much more like some kind of pernicious hypnosis to Robert Gu.Weekdays, Miri was off at school; a limo pulled up for her every morning, always at the moment that the girl was ready to go.Bob was gone nowadays, "to be back in a week or so. "Alice was home part of each day, but she was in a distinctly short tempered mood.Sometimes he would see her at lunch; more often, his daughter in law was at Camp Pendleton until midafternoon.She was especially irritable when she came back from the base.Except for Reed Weber's therapy sessions, Robert was left much to his own devices.He wandered around the house, found some of his old books in cardboard boxes in the basement.Those were almost the only books in the house.This family was effectively illiterate.Sure, Miri bragged that many books were visible any time you wanted to see them, but that was a half truth.The browser paper that Reed had given him could be used to find books online, but reading them on that single piece of foolscap was a tedious desecration.It was remarkable foolscap, though.It really did support teleconferencing; Dr.Aquino and the remote therapists were not just invisible voices anymore.And the web browser was much like the ones he remembered, even though many sites couldn't be displayed properly.Google still worked.He searched for Lena Llewelyn Gu.Of course, there was plenty of information about her.Lena had been a medical doctor and rather well known in a limited, humdrum way.And yes, she had died a couple of years ago.The details were a cloud of contradiction, some agreeing with what Bob told him, some not.It was this damn Friends of Privacy.It was hard to imagine such villains, doing their best to undermine what you could find on the net.A "vandal charity" was what they called themselves.And that eventually got him into the News of the Day.The world was as much a mess as ever.This month, it was a police action in Paraguay.The details didn't make sense.What were "moonshine fabs" and why would the U. S.  want to help local cops close them down?The big picture was more familiar.The invading forces were looking for Weapons of Mass Destruction.Today they had found nuclear weapons hidden beneath an orphanage.The pictures showed slums and poor people, ragged children playing inscrutable games that somehow seemed to deny the squalor all around.There was an occasional, almost lonely looking, soldier.I'll bet this is where Bob is , he thought.Not for the first time  or the thousandth  he wondered how his son could have chosen such an ugly, dead end career.Evenings they had something like a family meal, Alice and Robert and Miri.Alice seemed happy to do the cooking, though tonight she looked like she hadn't slept for a couple of days.Robert hung around the kitchen, watching mother and daughter slide trays from the fridge."TV dinners, that's what we used to call this sort of thing," he said.In fact, this stuff had the appearance and texture of delicious food.It all tasted like mush to him, but Reed said that was because his taste buds were ninety five percent dead.Miri hesitated the way she often did when Robert tossed out some idea she hadn't heard before.But as usual, her response was full of confidence."Oh, these are much better than TV junk food.We can mix and match the parts. "She pointed at the unmarked containers sizzling in  well, it looked like a microwave."See, I got the ice cream dessert and Alice got angel hair blueberries.Wow, Alice!"Alice gave her a brief smile."I'll share.Okay, let's get this into the dining room. "It took all three of them to carry everything, but no second trip was needed.They set the food on the long dining table.The tablecloth was an intricate damask that seemed to be different every night.The table itself was familiar, another hand me down.Lena's presence was still everywhere.Robert sat down beside Miri."You know," he said, more to probe reactions than anything else."This all seems a bit primitive to me.Where are the robot servants  or even the little automatic hands to put the TV dinners in the 'wave and take them out?"His daughter in law gave an irritated shrug."Where it makes sense, we have robots. "Robert remembered Alice Gong when she had married Bob.Back then, Alice had been an impenetrable diplomat  so smooth that most people never realized her skill.In those days, he had still had his edge both with verse and with people; he took such a personality as a challenge.And yet, his former self had never been able to find a chink in her armor.The new Alice only imitated the composure of the old, and with varying success.Tonight was not one of her better nights.Robert remembered the news about Paraguay and took a stab in the dark."Worried about Bob?"She gave him an odd smile."No.Bob is fine. "Miri glanced at her mother and then chirped, "Actually, if you want mechs, you should see my doll collection. "Mechs?Dolls?It was hard to dominate people when you didn't know what they were talking about.He backed up: "I mean, there are all the things that future freaks have been predicting for a hundred years and that never happened.Things such as air cars. "Miri looked up from her steaming food.At one corner of the tray there really was a bowl of ice cream."We have air taxis.Does that count?""That gets partial credit. "Then he surprised himself: "When can I see one?"The Robert of old would have dimissed mechanical contrivances as beneath any mature interest."Any time!How about after dinner?"This last question was directed at Alice as much as Robert.That brought a more natural smile to Alice's face."Maybe this weekend. "They ate in silence for a moment.I wish I could taste this stuff .Then Alice was onto the topic she must have been saving up: "You know, Robert, I've been looking at the medics' reports on you.You're almost up to speed now.Have you considered resuming your career?""Why, of course.I'm thinking about it all the time.I've got new writing ideas  " He gestured expansively, and was surprised by the fear that suddenly rose in him."Hey, don't worry, Alice.I've got my writing.I've got job offers from schools all around the country.I'll be out of your way as soon as I get my feet solidly on the ground. "Miri said, "Oh no, Robert!You can stay with us.We like having you here. ""But at this point don't you think you should be actively reaching out?"said Alice.Robert looked back mildly."How is that?""Well, you know that Reed Weber's last session with you is next Tuesday.I'll bet there are still new skills you'd like to master.Have you considered taking classes?Fairmont High has a number of special  "  Colonel Alice was doing pretty well, but she was handicapped by the thirteen year old at Robert's side.Miri piped up with "Yecco.That's our vocational track.A few old people and lots of teenage dumbheads.It's dull, dull, dull. ""Miri, there are basic skills  "  "Reed Weber has done a lot of that.And I can teach Robert to wear. "She patted his arm."Don't worry, Robert.Once you learn to wear, you can learn anything.Right now, you're in a trap; it's like you're seeing the world through a little hole, just whatever your naked eye sees  and what you can get from that'' She pointed at the magic foolscap that was tucked into his shirt pocket."With some practice you should be able to see and hear as good as anyone. "Alice shook her head."Miri.There are lots of people who don't use contacts and wearables. ""Yes, but they're not my grandfather. "And there was that defiant little thrust of her jaw."Robert, you should be wearing.You look silly walking around with that view page clutched in your hand. "Alice seemed about to object more forcefully.Then she settled back, watching Miri with a neutral gaze that Robert couldn't fathom.Miri didn't seem to notice the look.She leaned her head forward, and stuck a finger close to her right eye."You already know about contacts, right?Wanna see one?"Her hand came away from her eye.A tiny disk sat on the tip of her middle finger.It was the size and shape of the contact lenses he had known.He hadn't expected anything more, but he bent close and looked.After a moment, he realized that it was not quite a clear lens.Speckles of colored brightness swirled and gathered in it."I'm driving it at safety max, or you wouldn't see the lights. "The tiny lens became hazy, then frosty white."Uk.It powered down.But you get the idea. "She popped it back into her eye, and grinned at him.Now her right eye was fogged with an enormous cataract."You should get a fresh one, dear," said Alice."Oh no," said Miri."Once it warms up, it'll be good for the rest of the day. "And in fact the "cataract" was fading, Miri's dark brown iris showing through."So what do you think, Robert?"That it's a rather gross substitute for what I can do simply by reading my view page ."That's all there is to it?""um, no.I mean, we can fix you up with one of Bob's shirts and a box of contacts right away.It's learning to use them that's the trick. "Colonel Alice said, "Without some control it's like old time television, but much more intrusive.We wouldn't want you to be hijacked, Robert.How about this: I'll get you some trainer clothes and that box of contacts that Miri mentioned.Meantime, give some thought to attending Fairmont High, okay?"Miri leaned forward and grinned at her mother."Betcha he's wearing inside of a week.He won't need those loser classes. "Robert smiled benignly over Miri's head.In fact, there had been job offers.His return had percolated onto the web, and twelve schools had written him.But five were simply speaking invitations.Three were for semester artist in residence gigs.And the others weren't from first rank schools.It was not exactly the welcome Robert expected for one of "the century's literary giants" (quoting the critics here).They're afraid I'm still a vegetable.So Robert kept the offers on ice and worked on his writing.He would show the doubters he was as sharp as ever  and in the doing, he would overleap them, to the sort of recognition he deserved.But progress was slow on the poetry front.Progress was slow on a lot of fronts.His face actually looked young now.Reed said such complete cosmetic success was rare, that Robert was a perfect target for the "Venn Kurasawa" process.Wonderful.But his coordination remained spastic and his joints ached all the time.Most ignominious, he still had to hike down to the John several times each night to take a leak.That was surely the Fates reminding him he was still an old man.Yesterday had been Weber's last visit.The guy had a menial mind, but it was exactly matched to the menial aid he provided.I'll miss him, I suppose .Not least because now there was another empty hour in every day.And progress was especially slow on the poetry front.For Robert, dreams had never been an important source of inspiration (though he had claimed otherwise in several well known interviews).But wide awake attempts at creativity were the last resort of pedestrian minds.For Robert Gu, real creativity most often came after a good night's sleep, just as he roused himself to wakefulness.That moment was such a reliable source of inspiration that when he was having problems with writing he would often go the pedestrian route in the evening, stock up his mind with the intransigencies of the moment and then the next morning, drowsing, review what he knew.There in the labile freshness of new consciousness, answers would drift into view.In his years at Stanford, he'd run the phenomenon past philosophers, religionists, and the hard science people.They'd had a hundred explanations, from Freudian psychology to quantum physics.The explanation didn't matter; "sleeping on it" worked for him.And now, coming out of years of dementia, he still had that morning edge.But his control of the process was as erratic as ever.Some mornings, his mind was awash with ideas for "Secrets of the One Who Came Back" and his revision of "Secrets of the Dying. "Yet none of these morning brainstorms contained poetical detail.He had the ideas.He had concepts down to the level of verse blocks.But he didn't have the words and phrases that made ideas into beauty.Maybe that was okay.For now.After all, making the words sing was the highest, purest talent.Didn't it make sense that such would be his very last talent to return?In the meantime, many of his mornings were wasted on garbage insights.His subconscious had turned traitor, fascinated by how things worked, by technology and math.During the day, when he was surfing his view page, he was constantly diverted by topics unrelated to any artistic concern.He had spent one whole afternoon on a "child's introduction" to finite geometry, for God's sake and the big insight he wakened with the next morning had been a proof of one of the harder exercises.Robert's day time was a grinding bore, an endless search for the right words, all the while trying to ignore the lure of his view page.His evenings were spent putting off Miri and her attempts to stick foreign objects onto his eyeballs.Finally, morning insight came to his rescue.Rising toward wakefulness, thinking dispassionately about his failure, he noticed the green junipers beyond his window, the yard painted in soft pastels.There was a world outside.There were a million different viewpoints there.What had he done in the past when progress hit roadblocks?You take a break .Do something different; almost anything.Going back to "high school" would get him out of this, get Miri out of his hair.It would certainly expose him to different, even if narrow, viewpoints.Alice would be so pleased.04    An Excellent Affiliance  Juan Orozco liked to walk to school with the Radner twins.Fred and Jerry were a Bad Influence, but they were the best gamers Juan knew in person."We got a special scam for today, Juan," said Fred."Yeah," said Jerry, smiling the way he did when something really fun or embarrassing was on the way.The three followed the usual path along the flood control channel.The concrete trough was dry and bone white, winding its way through the canyon behind the Mesitas subdivision.The hills above them were covered with iceplant and manzanita; ahead, there was a patch of scrub oaks.What do you expect of San Diego North County in early October?At least in the real world.The canyon was not a deadzone.Not at all.County Flood Control kept the whole area improved, and the public layer was just as fine as on city streets.As they walked along, Juan gave a shrug and a twitch just so.That was enough cue for his Epiphany wearable.Its overlay imagery shifted into Hacek's Dangerous Knowledge world: The manzanita morphed into scaly tentacles.Now the houses that edged the canyon were large and heavily timbered, with pennants flying.High ahead was a castle, the home of Grand Duke Hwa Feen  in reality, the local kid who did the most to maintain this belief circle.Juan tricked out the twins in the leather armor of Knights Guardian."Hey, Jer, look. "Juan radiated, and waited for the twins to slide into consensus with his view.He had been practicing a week to get these visuals in place.Fred looked up, accepting the imagery that Juan had conjured."That's old stuff, Juanito. "He glanced at the castle on the hill."Besides, Howie Fein is a dwit. ""Oh. "Juan released the vision in an untidy cascade.The real world took back its own, first the landscape, then the sky, then the creatures and costumes."But you liked it last week. "Back when, Juan now remembered, Fred and Jerry had been maneuvering to oust the Grand Duke.The twins looked at each other.Juan could tell they were silent messaging."We told you today would be different.We're onto something special.
