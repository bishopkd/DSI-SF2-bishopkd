But general trends could be seen.Whether or not it had been a deliberate choice on Eve Moiras part, colors in the cool part of the paletteblue, green, purple, cyanwere linked to the four Eves she was personally closest to, while warm colorsred, yellow, orangewere saved for the others.When the entire ring was plotted according to this scheme, and the plot was viewed as a whole, with Greenwich at twelve oclock and Tokomaru at six, one therefore saw a great arc of cool colors starting at about ten oclock (the western end of the Indus boneyard) and sweeping around to about five oclock (the eastern end of the Hawaii boneyard).A shorter arc of warm colors ran from a little before six oclock to a little after nine.The rings top most segment, centered on Greenwich, was frosty white, like a polar icecap flanked by purple mountains, green hills, and blue water.But on its bottom left side, the ring looked as if it were being heated by a blowtorch, glowing in the warm tones that spoke of predominantly Camite, Adan, and Julian populations.That segment was marked off, on the plot, by two red lines drawn athwart the ring.One was located at the longitude of 166 degrees, 30 minutes west, above the former Pacific island of Kiribati.This placed it near the eastern end of the Julian segment.The other was at precisely 90 degrees east, running through the habitat called Dhaka, in the exact center of the Camites arc.The lines were borders: not just imaginary frontiers but literal barriers that had been constructed, like turnpikes, across the ring.The warm colored arc of habitats stretching between them, incorporating most of the Julian segment, all of the Adan segment, and exactly half of the Camite segment, was, to Kath Two and the others aboard this flivver, another country.The relationship between it and the larger, cool colored segment where they lived could be described in many possible ways, of which the most succinct was war.THE TEKLAN, SEEING THAT KATH TWO HAD LIFTED HER HEAD FROM the rest and thereby joined the temporary society of the flivver, turned toward her.He stuck his right elbow out to the side, made a blade of his hand, palm down, and snapped it in until his thumbnail was touching the point of his chin, then, after a moments pause, elevated it to the level of his forehead.Beled Tomov, he said.But Kath Two had already known this, since it was stenciled on the outside of his suit.Kath Two made a similar gesture, though in the style of her race she used her left hand and kept the palm toward her, fingers curled into a loose fist.Kath Amalthova, Two.Both of them looked toward the Dinan.During the previous moments he had kept his gaze averted in a way that, as everyone understood, meant that he had been taking a leak into his suits urine collection system and wanted privacy.But now he looked up and performed the gesture, also left armed, with a slight variation in the attitude of the hand, beginning with his palm toward him but flipping it over to face outward as he brought it to his forehead.Rhys Alaskov.This style of greeting was a throwback to the early days of the Cloud Ark and the first generations spawned on Cleft by the Seven Eves.People then had spent a lot of time in space suits equipped with outer visors that could be flipped up or down to compensate for sunlight.When the visor was pulled down, it concealed the wearers face behind a reflective metallized screen.When it was pushed up, the face could be seen.In the crowded environments of those days, the upward movement of the hand had become a signal meaning Hello, I am available for social interaction, and its reverse had come to mean Goodbye or I wish for privacy now.These gestures practical necessity had withered away as the human races had spread out into habitats where they could get privacy whenever they desired it.They lived on, however, as salutes.Beled Tomov had opted for a military style, using the right hand, the subtext being I am not going to kill you with a concealed weapon.In gravity, the next move might then have been to reach out for a handshake.In zero gee this usually wasnt practical and so was rarely done.The left handed version suggested a nonmilitary vocation, implying that the saluters right hand was busy doing something useful.The variations in hand position were racial and their origins were the subject of folkloric research.All agreed, however, that they were useful for signaling ones race when far away, or when obscured in a space suit.The cues in size, shape, posture, and bearing that distinguished the races could be subtle, particularly when it was not possible to see facial features and hair color.Rhys Alaskov had the honey hair and freckled skin typical of a Dinan.Teklans too were fair.But where Rhys had an open, appealing face and an engaging manner, Beled was all cheek  and jawbones, sleek and bony at the same time, eyes so blue they were nearly white, hair like fiber optic glass, cropped close to his skull.His affect matched his look.Kath Two was dark brown, with green eyes and woolly black hair.Close, in other words, to the way Eve Moira had looked.Among the three in this flivver, the largest contrast was therefore between her and Beled.And yet five thousand years of acculturation shaped the way they would interact.If some crisis were to arise, Kath Two and Beled would likely find themselves back to back, each instinctively seeking qualities wanted in the other.And in the absence of a crisis, they might find themselves front to front.A similar complementary relationship obtained between Dinans and Ivyns, but as it happened Rhys Alaskov was without an opposite number at the momentthat empty fourth couch.All of which, and more, was just subtext, passed over in a fraction of a second.Rhys pushed off gently and floated toward the nest of displays that served as the flivvers control panel.The same functions, of course, might have been served within his varp, but it was considered desirable to make the ships status clearly visible to everyone in the cabin, and so that kind of information tended to be splashed up on large screens.Rhys was going to establish contact with whatever habitat was at their apogee, chat up whoever was answering the phone on the other end, and smooth the way in general.While he was floating slowly across the cabin, he said, I trust you both had good surveys?Nominal, Beled announced.Kath Two was about to make a remark in the same vein when she remembered the Indigen, or whoever it was, watching her glider from the shelter of the trees by the lake.The impression had been so fleeting.Had she imagined it?She was certain she hadnt.But memory could play funny tricks.Mine was fascinating, Rhys said, when Kath Two failed to take the bait for a while.Any irregularities?asked Beled, just as Kath Two was saying, What was so interesting?Sensing Beleds gaze on her, Kath Two turned his way and understood that his question had been aimed as much at her as at Rhys.It was in Rhyss nature as a Dinan, however, to assume that the question was all for him.His eyes flicked between Kath Two and Beled.Knowing he was the odd man out here, he responded with a grin that was, of course, charming.I think I can answer both questions at once.He had reached the chair centered in the cockpit.The canids are going epi in a huge way.Theyve become nearly unrecognizable.He brought the controls to life with a few sweeps of his fingers, and the screens lit up all around him.A canid was a thing like a dog, wolf, or coyote.Rather than trying to bring back individual species, DocDr.Hu Noahhad drawn inspiration from research that had emerged in Old Earth scientific journals shortly before Zero, suggesting that the boundaries among those commonly recognized species were so muddy as to be meaningless.They all could and did mate with each other and produce hybrid offspring.For various reasons these tended to group by size and shape in a way that human observers saw as being distinct species.But when humans werent looking, or when the environment shifted, all manner of coy dogs and coy wolves and wolf dogs appeared.Coyotes began hunting in packs like wolves, or wolves went solo like coyotes.Creatures that had avoided, or eaten, humans struck up partnerships with them; family pets went feral.Hu Noah was 120 years old.As a young man he had been one of many scientists who had rebelled against a tradition of TerReForm thought that had passed as gospel for hundreds of years previously.Thanks in part to the young Turks propagandizing, this older approach had become hidebound and stereotyped as the TOT, or Take Our Time, school.The premise of TOT was that ecosystemswhich on Old Earth had evolved over hundreds of millions of yearswould have to be rebuilt slowly, through a sort of handcrafting process.Which was fine, since living in habitats was safer and more comfortable anyway than the unpredictable surface of a planet.The human races could enjoy thousands of years of safe, secure habitat life while slowly re creating ecosystems down below that would resemble those of Old Earth.The planet would become a sort of ecological preserve.Africa, whose outlines were still vaguely recognizable, though heavily reshaped by the Hard Rain, would have giraffes and lions sequenced from the ones and zeroes dating all the way back to the thumb drive around Eve Moiras neck.Likewise with the other battered and reforged continents.Doc was the last surviving member of the young Turk faction that had named, then rubbished, the TOT lot.They were called the GID, or Get It Done, school.Their leader had been Leuk Markov, who himself had been over a hundred years old when he had become Docs teacher.Obviously from his name (which was taken from the surname of Eve Dinahs boyfriend Markus), Leuk had been a Dinan, but Doc and most of his followers were Ivyns, which gave them an air of seriousness and credibility that had proved useful in pressing their agenda.They had formed a partnership with mostly Moiran philosophers who had begun questioning the TOT lots premises, pointing out that re creating simulacra of Old Earth biomes, in addition to taking an unreasonably long time, reflected a basically sentimental way of thinking about nature.It was an expression of a sort of post traumatic stress disorder that the human races had carried on their backs ever since the Hard Rain.It was time to discard that.The old ecosystems would never return.Even if it were possible to bring them back, it would take so long as to not be worth it.In any eventand this was the nail in the coffin, supplied personally by Docit would fail anyway because the forces of natural selection were unpredictable and uncontrollable.The most powerful weapon in the GID schools arsenal, however, was not philosophy.It was impatience, a failing shared to a greater or lesser degree by all the races.Second only to that was competitiveness, a quality absent in Camites but present in the other six.Anyone so motivated would of course want to Get It Done, to make the TerReForm happen in centuries rather than millennia.Their rise to power had, however, produced political consequences they had never imagined by giving the races something to compete fornamely, territory on the surface of New Earth.In the early 4820s, Leuk Markov had published papers speculating that the surface of New Earth could be made ready for permanent human habitations as early as 5050.While that was startlingly soon by the standards of the Take Our Time school, it had seemed far in the future to the average person, and so the council of scientists responsible for planning the TerReForm had seen no problem with enshrining it in the schedule, and later even moving it up to 5005the anniversary of the landing on Cleft.But the shift in thinking had unleashed long pent up political forces that had led to the formation of what amounted to two different countries in the year 4830.The Adans, who dominated one of them, bringing many Camites and Julians under their sway, had built the turnpikes at Kiribati and Dhaka in 4855, cleaving the ring.They eventually came up with a formal name for their country, obliging the rest of the ring to come up with a name for theirs, but everyone simply called them Red and Blue.TerReForm had continued anyway, through ad hoc cooperation between scientists and labs straddling the Red/Blue borders.Twenty three years later, howeverpractically as soon as New Earths atmosphere had become breathable without artificial aidshad begun the War on the Rocks, a struggle carried out partly in space but mostly on the still nude surface of New Earth.This had been terminated in 4895 by what was now called First Treaty, which stipulated among other things how subsequent TerReForm activity was going to proceed.It had thus paved the way for the Great Seeding, which was responsible for the trees that Kath Two had been flying over this morning.In subsequent decades, larger and larger animals had been set loose on the surface as part of a planned program to jump start whole ecosystems.Some of thosethe ones Kath Two had been worried about this morningwere canids.When Rhys said that they were going epi, he meant that they were passing through some kind of epigenetic shift.If the Agent had blown up the moon a couple of decades earlier, Eve Moira wouldnt have known about epigenetics.It was still a new science at the time she was sent up to the Cloud Ark.During her first years in space, when she and her equipment had been coddled in the most protected zones of Izzy and Endurance, shed had plenty of time to bone up on the topic.Like most children of her era, shed been taught to believe that the genomethe sequence of base pairs expressed in the chromosomes in every nucleus of the bodysaid everything there was to say about the genetic destiny of an organism.A small minority of those DNA sequences had clearly defined functions.The remainder seemed to do nothing, and so were dismissed as junk DNA.But that picture had changed during the first part of the twenty first century, as more sophisticated analysis had revealed that much of that so called junk actually performed important roles in the functioning of cells by regulating the expression of genes.Even simple organisms, it turned out, possessed many genes that were suppressed, or silenced altogether, by such mechanisms.The central promise of genomicsthat by knowing an organisms genome, scientists could know the organismhad fallen far short as it had become obvious that the phenotype (the actual creature that met the biologists eye, with all of its observable traits and behaviors) was a function not only of its genotype (its DNA sequences) but also of countless nanodecisions being made from moment to moment within the organisms cells by the regulatory mechanisms that determined which genes to express and which to silence.Those regulatory mechanisms were of several types, and many were unfathomably complex.Had it not been for the sudden intervention of the Agent, the biologists of Old Earth would have devoted at least the remaining decades of the century to cataloging these mechanisms and understanding their effectsa then new science called epigenetics.Instead of which, on Cleft, in the hands of Eve Moira and the generations of biologists she reared, it became a tool.They had needed all the tools they could get, and they had wielded them pragmatically, bordering on ruthlessly, to ensure the survival of the human races.When creating the children of the other six Eves, Moira had avoided using epigenetic techniques.She had felt at liberty, however, to perform some experiments on her own genome.It had gone poorly at first, and her first eight pregnancies had been failures.But her last, the only daughter of Moira to survive, had flourished.Cantabrigia, as Moira had named her after the university of Cambridge, had founded the race of which Kath Two was a member.By the time the Great Seeding was in the works, thousands of years later, epigenetics was sufficiently well understood to be programmed into the DNA of some of the newly created species that would be let loose on the surface of New Earth.And one of the planks in the Get It Done platform was to use epigenetics for all it was worth.So rather than trying to sequence and breed a new subspecies of coyote that was optimized for, and that would breed true in, a particular environment, as the TOT school would have had it, the GID approach was to produce a race of canines that would, over the course of only a few generations, become coyotes or wolves or dogsor something that didnt fit into any of those categoriesdepending on what happened to work best.They would all start with a similar genetic code, but different parts of it would end up being expressed or suppressed depending on circumstances.And no particular effort would be made by humans to choose and plan those outcomes.They would seed New Earth and see what happened.If an ecosystem failed to take in a particular area, they would just try something else.In the decades since such species had been seeded onto New Earth, this had been going on all the time.Epigenetic transformation had been rampantand, since Survey was thin on the ground, largely unobserved by humans.Still, when it led to results that humans saw, and happened to find surprising, it was known as going epi.Use of the phrase was discouraged for being unscientific, but Rhys Alaskov knew how to get away with it.Rhys brought up a rendering of the habitat ring and zoomed in on the whitish segment at its top.Their projected route was superimposed as a crisp green arc that curled through apogee near a succession of relatively small habitats just to the east of Greenwich.For the first habitats constructed in each segmentclose to the seeds of Greenwich, Rio, et al.had naturally tended to be smaller than the ones that came along later, when the construction process had hit its stride.The closer to a boneyard you got, the larger the habitats generally became.As Rhys panned and zoomed around, habitat names came and went on the screen: Hannibal, Brussels, Oyo, Auvergne, Vercingetorix, Steve Lake.The latter aroused a flicker of interest.Kath One had had an old friend living there.But the friendship wouldnt likely have survived the transition to Kath Two.She brought the same thing up on her varp and zoomed out to remind herself of the current location of the Eye.If the habitat ring as a whole was like the dial of a clock, then the Eye, with its inner and outer tethersone depending toward Earth, the other reaching out beyond the habitat ringwas a hand.Any description of the Eye had to begin by mentioning that it was the largest object ever made.Most of its material had come from Cleft.It was, in a sense, the thing Cleft had ultimately shape shifted into.Its innermost piece was a spinning, ring shaped city of sufficient diametersome fifty kilometersthat even the largest space habitats could pass through its center with plenty of room to spare.This made the Eye capable of sweeping all the way around the ring, encompassing in turn each of the ten thousand separate habitats.Or at least that had been the original plan.In practice, its sweep was limited to the Blue part of the ring that began at Dhaka and ran westward about two thirds of the way around the ring to the fringe of the Julian segment.At both of those locations, barriersliteral turnpikes, consisting of long splinters of nickel iron laid directly across the ringhad been constructed by Red to physically block movement of the Eye into their segment.So instead of sweeping around like the hand of a clock, it bounced back and forth between the turnpikes, confining itself to Blue habitats.During the ensuing century and a half, Red had been at work on something huge that appeared to be an anti Eye in the making, and that would presumably sweep back and forth, in like manner, over their segment.But it had never budged from its geostationary orbit above the Makassar Strait, and no one in Blue really knew how soon it might become operational.The Great Chain, as the rotating city was called, lined a circular opening, like an iris, in the middle of the Eye.To either side of it, the Eye tapered to a point.One of those points was always aimed toward the center of Earth and the other was always aimed away from it.A cable, or rather a redundant, self healing network of them, emerged from each of those two points.The inner one hung almost all the way down to the Earths surface, where a thing called Cradle dangled from it.The outer cable stretched for some distance beyond the habitat ring and terminated in the Big Rock, which served as a counterweight.By adjusting the length of the latter cable it was possible to move the whole constructs center of gravity closer to or farther away from Earth, causing it to speed up or slow down in its orbit relative to the habitats in the ring.Thus it could sweep around like the hand of a clock, passing around each habitat along the way, or pausing for a time as needed.And when it was encircling a particular habitat it could easily exchange people and goods with it, via flivvers, or cargo shuttles, or swarms of nats, or mechanical contraptions that could snake out like tentacles.To be in a habitateven a quite large and cosmopolitan onewhen the Eye came around was, in pre Zero terms, a little bit like being in a small town on the prairie and having a mobile Manhattan suddenly roll over the horizon, surround you, have a hundred kinds of intercourse with you, and then move on.Among its many other functions, it was a passenger ferry: the most straightforward way of moving among habitats.This was why Kath Two needed to remind herself of where it was at the moment and which direction it was moving.The answer was that it was about twenty degrees west of their projected apogee, encircling a large new habitat called Akureyri, and heading generally in the direction of the Cape Verde boneyard that separated the Greenwich segment from the Rio segment.Which meant that it would soon be in the predominantly Ivyn part of the ring.Whip over high and catch the Eye?she asked.This amounted to a proposal that they should avail themselves of a kind of huge aluminum bullwhipa very common device on the ringto project their flivver into a higher orbit.As they curved slowly through apogee out beyond the ring, everything below themthe entire contents of the habitat ring, including the Eyewould speed past them on the inside track, so that by the time they looped back to it, the Eye would have caught up with them.They could dock their flivver to any of its hundreds of available ports, pass through Quarantine in relative comfort, and go their separate ways, using the Eye as a ferry to take them wherever they wanted to go, or as a transit hub where they could change to passenger flivvers or liners that might transport them more directly to other places in the system.Or they could ride the elevator down to Cradle.Or they could just remain on the Eye, a habitat in its own right where many people lived their entire lives.When possible, catching the Eye was almost always preferable to ending up on some random habitat whence it might take days or even weeks to get transit onward, and so proposals like this one were rarely controversial.Works for me, Rhys said immediately.Kath Two glanced toward Beled and saw him looking back at her.She understood that the Teklan had, in a manner unchanged through thousands of years of racial subspeciation and acculturation to the social and cultural environment of space, been checking her out.She raised an eyebrow at him, just slightly.Of course, said Beled.Unanimous.Ill punch it in, Rhys announced, and went to work at the interface panel.Kath Two had felt a mildly embarrassing faint tingle between her legs, a sort of blush, accompanied by a bit of warmth in the face.She expected that Beled was reciprocating at some level.But Teklans were trained not to show their feelings, out of a belief, supposedly traceable all the way back to the ancient Spartans, that emotions such as fear resulted from their visible expression, rather than the other way around.Perhaps sensing what was going on between Kath Two and Beled, Rhys focused on his task somewhat more intently than was really needed.The complications, as always, had to do with avoiding collisions and respecting what was still called air space around habitats, even though it had no air in it and might more properly have been called space space.Kath Two, keeping half an eye on the brief and businesslike conversation between Rhys and Parambulator (which, to her eyes, had nothing whatsoever in common with whatever was meant by punching it inbut this was just how Dinans liked to express themselves), saw that they would pass through the twenty kilometer wide gap between habitats named Saint Exupry and Knutholmen.Midway between them was a whip station.Almost every habitat of significance was bracketed between two of these installations.The whip stations were small habitats, crewed by half a dozen or so humans who got rotated out every few months so they would not go crazy from boredom.Their job was to look after thousands of flynks: the latest generation of a lineage of robots that went all the way back to Rhys Aitkens work aboard Izzy.He had been working with fingernail sized nats.The ones on whip stations performed the same functions, but they were much bigger.The chains that they formed had the mass and momentum of pre Zero freight trains, capable of undulating and cracking like a whip, or reaching out at distant targets like the fly on the end of a fishing line.Some wear and tear was involved.Flynks could have been inspected and repaired by other robots, but Blues overall cultural bias in favor of having humans in the loop had led to much of the work being done by flesh and blood crew members.In any case, supposing those people had been doing their job, keeping their fleet of flynks ready for use, and assuming that no other space travelers had already reserved that time slot on that whip station, the flivver carrying Kath Two, Rhys, and Beled would, in something like twelve hours time, rendezvous with the tip of an aluminum bullwhip that would then snap it into a circular orbit with a slightly higher radius than that of the ring.A few hours later, they would dock at Port 65 in the Quarantine Section of the outer limb of the Eye.The Eye observed whatever time was local on the part of Earth lying directly below it.Currently, it was about eight in the morning there.She could look forward to some serious jet laganother term from the pre Zero era that had become embedded in the language despite the obsolescence of its literal meaning.According to one convention, they should switch over to Eye time now, so that they could begin adjusting.But they had all finished long days on New Earth and were too exhausted at this moment to maintain the pretense that it was first thing in the morning for them.They would have plenty of time to adjust in Quarantine.Kath Two reserved a Moiran friendly bed and meal plan at Port 65, then plummeted into sleep.THE IRIS OF THE EYE WAS TOO BIG TO HAVE BEEN FABRICATED AS A single rigid object.It had been built, beginning about nine hundred years ago, out of links that had been joined together into a chain; the two ends of the chain then connected to form a loop.The method would have seemed familiar to Rhys Aitken, who had used something like it to construct Izzys T3 torus.For him, or anyone else versed in the technological history of Old Earth, an equally useful metaphor would have been that it was a train, 157 kilometers long, made of 720 giant cars, with the nose of the locomotive joined to the tail of the caboose so that it formed a circular construct 50 kilometers in diameter.An even better analogy would have been to a roller coaster, since its purpose was to run loop the loops forever.The track on which the train ran was a circular groove in the iron frame of the Eye, lined with the sensors and magnets needed to supply electrodynamic suspension, so that the whole thing could spin without actually touching the Eyes stationary frame.This was an essential design requirement given that the Great Chain had to move with a velocity of about five hundred meters per second in order to supply Earth normal gravity to its inhabitants.Each of the links had approximately the footprint of a Manhattan city block on Old Earth.And their total number of 720 was loosely comparable to the number of such blocks that had once existed in the gridded part of Manhattan, depending on where you drew the boundariesit was bigger than Midtown but smaller than Manhattan as a whole.Residents of the Great Chain were acutely aware of the comparison, to the point where they were mocked for having a Manhattan complex by residents of other habitats.They were forever freeze framing Old Earth movies or zooming around in virtual reality simulations of pre Zero New York for clues as to how street and apartment living had worked in those days.They had taken as their patron saint Luisa, the eighth survivor on Cleft, a Manhattanite who had been too old to found her own race.Implicit in that was that the Great Chainthe GC, Chaintown, Chainhattanwas a place that people might move to when they wanted to separate themselves from the social environments of their home habitats, or indeed of their own races.Mixed race people were more common there than anywhere else.As in Manhattan, the discretization of the space imposed form on how it had developed, with each link of the chaineach city blockacquiring its own skyline and identity.Groups of consecutive blocks had long since coalesced into neighborhoods.Each block was, in effect, a fully independent space vehicle with its own system for keeping the air from leaking out.But each was connected to its two neighbors by a bundle of passageways routed through its foundation slab, which made it possible to move easily from one to the next in the same way that the Londoners of Old Earth had used underground passagessubways in the London sense of that wordto cut beneath crowded intersections.Some of the subways were sized for human pedestrians.Four of them carried trains: locals and express service running both directions around the full circuit of the Great Chain.Still others were reserved for robotic vehicles programmed to carry cargo.Beyond that was a wide range of smaller conduits carrying air, water, power, and information.All of them went by the name of subwaysthis was a conflation of the old London and New York senses of the word.At each end of each block was a system of airlocks; these would seal themselves off in the event that a block were to depressurize.People ran marathons through themfour consecutive marathons made up about one circuit around the entire Chain.Every fifth link in the Chain was public property.These tended to be parks, though some served as cultural facilities.So you were never more than two links away from green, or at least open, space.The other 576 links were privately owned, and constituted a commercial and residential real estate market that would have been easily recognizable to any pre Zero property magnate.The Great Chain had been likened more than once to the ancient board game of Monopoly.Some stretches of the loop were more high rent, others less so.The pattern was interrupted in several places by special links, or short series of links, placed there to serve industrial and civic requirements, such as making the transit system work.One of those was the Ramp Link, whose purpose was to make connections, every five minutes, with the On Ramp and the Off Ramp.Since the Great Chain was moving at about five hundred meters per second with respect to the nonrotating frame of the Eye, persons wishing to get from the latter to the former needed to be accelerated to a fairly spectacular velocityalmost Mach 1.5before they could set foot on the Ramp, or any other, Link.And those wishing to dechain, as the expression had it, needed to be decelerated by the same amount.The acceleration and the deceleration were handled by machines built into a place on the rim of the iris of the Eye.Though some efforts had been made to camouflage their essential nature, they were really just guns for shooting humans, albeit humans strapped into comfortable, pressurized bullets.Outside of the Great Chain, the rest of the Eye was lightly infested with human beings, heavily so with robots.Most of it existed in microgravity, since the entire contraptionGreat Chain, tethers, and allwas in geosynchronous orbit, hence free fall, around Earth.As you moved away from its center, toward the two extremities of the Eye where the tethers emerged, you might begin to notice tidal forces, which would show up as very mild gravity like tugs.These shifted whenever the Eye adjusted its orbit to move around the habitat ring, and people who spent a lot of time there could always feel in their bones when a move was under way, like Old Earthers predicting the weather in their knees.The skeleton of the Eye was a simple space frame built in the Amalthean style, which was to say that it had been carved and shaped from existing material (Cleft) as opposed to fabricated from scratch.Aesthetically, it meant that the big structural elements had a rough hewn, space battered look about them, a bit like a log cabin with all the knots and bark still visible.Vacancies between the big structural elements had been filled in with giant machines, most notably several immense rotating masses whose purpose was to stabilize the whole Eye gyroscopically.The nooks and crannies between the machines had been caulked with pressurized spaces where humans could move about.Some of those rotated to produce simulated gravity; they were like miniature, torus shaped space colonies pinned to a much bigger structure.Docking ports tended to cluster near those.As Kath Twos eyes closed into sleep, she was gazing at the usual ring shaped formation of iridescent sparkles, so densely packed that they blended into each other on the varp.The Eye was a slightly larger white dot between twelve and one oclock; it would have been difficult to see were it not for the long white line representing its tether system, which ran from just above Earths surface all the way through the big white dot and beyond to the Big Rock.Their flivvers trajectory, a sharp green ellipse, projected from where they were now (near Earth) all the way out to slightly beyond the ring before curving back in to intersect the Eye.Through her eyelids she could see indistinct patterns, reminding her a little of the first thing shed seen this morning: the flickering lights on the walls of her tent.But then the varp figured out that her eyes were closed and shut off the display.When she opened her eyes, the varp noticed it and came back to life, rendering the display again.Generally it looked the same, but the Eye had moved a little bit, and the dot representing the flivver had covered most of the distance to the habitat ring.Zooming in, she could see the two habitats between which they were going to pass, and the much smaller rendering of the whip station between them, exercising its long hair thin flagellum in preparation for their arrival.She must have slept for something like ten hours.Moirans were notorious for it.Remembering the looks she had exchanged earlier with Beled, she felt, then stifled, mild embarrassment over the fact that she had spent most of the journey snoring away.She unstrapped and floated over to the zero gee toilet at the end of the flivvers cabin.When she emerged a few minutes later, she saw that Rhys was asleep, loosely strapped in before the control panel.Beled was still in his acceleration couch.He too had slipped on a varp, and she guessed from the way he was moving his hands and wiggling his fingers that he was working, as opposed to playing.He was probably filling out his Survey report.Which was what Kath Two ought to be doing.They represented a civilization that had, during the Fourth Millennium, executed a plan to undo the damage caused by the Agent by identifying, cataloging, reaching, corralling, and revectoring millions of rocks in orbit around Earth, while also reaching as far as the Kuiper Belt to acquire chunks of frozen water and methane and ammonia and bring them home and smash them into the ruined planet.Essentially all of this work had been accomplished by robots.So much metal had gone into their construction that millions of humans now lived in space habitats whose steel hulls consisted entirely of melted down and reforged robot carcasses.It would have been easy for them to blanket the surface of New Earth with robots and, without ever sending down a single human being, perform a kind of survey: one that was heavy on data and light on judgment.In that version of the world, Kath Two and the others would have spent their lives in habitats, working at varps and mining data.All sorts of interesting philosophical arguments could have been framed as to whether that approach was better or worse than what they were in fact doing.But philosophy didnt really enter into it.The decision to do it this way was driven partly by politics and partly by social mores.On the political front it boiled down to the terms of Second Treaty, which, eighteen years ago, had terminated the second Red Blue war, sometimes called the War in the Woods to distinguish it from the earlier War on the Rocks.The treaty imposed strict limitations on the number of robots that either side could send down to the surface.For that matter, it also limited the number of humans; but the upshot was that, given those limits, human surveyors could gather more useful information about conditions on New Earth than could robots beaming data up to the ring.On the social front it was a question of Amistics, which was a term that had been coined ages ago by a Moiran anthropologist to talk about the choices that different cultures made as to which technologies they would, and would not, make part of their lives.The word went all the way back to the Amish people of pre Zero America, who had chosen to use certain modern technologies, such as roller skates, but not others, such as internal combustion engines.All cultures did this, frequently without being consciously aware that they had made collective choices.To the extent that Blue had a definable culture, it tended to view technological aids with some ambivalence, a state of mind boiled down into the aphorism Each enhancement is an amputation.This was not so much a definable idea or philosophy as it was a prejudice, operant at a nearly subliminal level.It was traceable to certain parts of the Epic.In many of these, Tavistock Prowse played a role; he was seen as its literal embodiment in the sense that he had actually undergone a series of amputations, and been consumed as food, after throwing in his lot with the Swarm.Blue saw itselfaccording to cultural critics, defined itselfas the inheritors of the traditions of Endurance.By process of elimination, then, Red was the culture of the Swarm.A century and a half ago, Red had sealed itself off behind barriers both physical and cryptographic, so not much was known of its culture, but plenty of circumstantial evidence suggested that it had different Amistics from Blue.Specifically, the Reds were enthusiastic about personal technological enhancement.The upshot, here in the cabin of this flivver, was that the missions just concluded by Kath Two, Beled, and Rhys had no valuein effect, they had never happeneduntil reports had been filed.And the reports could not simply consist of data dumps and pictures.Surveyors had to write actual prose.And the more judgment and insight were condensed into that prose, the more highly it was thought of by people like Doc and, increasingly, his senior students.Knowing that, Kath Two had been writing her report since before her glider had touched down on a broad swath of grass a fortnight ago.What remained was some editing and a summary.This ought to have come easily.But half an hour after she pulled the document up on her varp, she found herself gazing at it, unable to focus.Beled, she finally said.Distinctly enough for him to hear it, not loud enough to wake up Rhys.Working on your report?he asked.He could see her, and the rest of the cabin, through the translucent light field of his varp.He might have seen the movements of her hands, indicative of text entry.In any case the question had a bit of an edge to it.Hours earlier, Beled had noted some uncertainty in Kath Twos face.There was no telling, now, how long hed been observing her through eyes screened by the varp.Did you see any Indigens?she asked him.He reached up and slid the varp onto the top of his head: a polite gesture.I planned my route to avoid a certain RIZ, he said.Registered Indigen Zone, a place listed by name in the Treaty as a district where Soonerspeople who had illegally gone to the surface ahead of schedulewere grandfathered in under the politely evasive term Indigens and allowed to live subject to certain restrictions.I saw it from a distance.They did not see me.Of course not, Kath Two said, suppressing a smile.Does that answer your question?Beled asked, knowing that it didnt.I think I saw one not in a RIZ, Kath Two said.This piqued Beleds attention.Establishing a settlement or No, Kath Two said firmly.Id have mentioned that.I think he, or she, was in scope.Meaning, conducting activities, such as hunting and gathering, within the scope of Second Treaty.Most likely fishing.But at least two hundred kilometers from the nearest RIZ.A long way to carry a dead fish, Beled remarked.Yeah, Kath Two said, and felt her face warm slightly.Obvious as it seemed now that Beled had pointed it out, shed missed that detail.Did you investigate further?Beled asked.Unable, Kath Two said.I saw this person from my glider, on my way out.It is not mandatory to explain every last thing in your report, Beled pointed out.To leave a loose end, under those circumstances, is acceptable.It will give some other surveyor a challenging and welcome task to shoulder.An idea came to Kath Two.What if we were shouldering it?Explain.Does it seem to you as though there was an unusual concentration of Survey activity in that one zone?Unusual, Beled allowed, after thinking about it for a few moments.Not without precedent.Makes me wonder, Kath Two said, if some previous surveyor saw what I saw, and triggered a wave of missions in the same area.In that case, Beled pointed out, Survey would have informed us of what it was they were sending us to look for.That was so sensible, and Beled said it with such simple conviction, that Kath Two nodded and declined to press it any further.But she was thinking, Unless it is something they dont want us to know.The conversation with Beled had been useful in that it had given her a way to proceed, which was simply to type up the Indigen sighting as a loose end, and thus drop it into the lap of whoever read the report.She went to work on that general plan, trying to clarify the fleeting memory in her minds eye, to sort out objective observations, made in the moment, from judgments and suppositions shed added later.Which was tricky, since the latter were supposed to be part of her job.A while later Rhys was awakened by an alarm hed set on his wrist.He made a sleepy flight to the toilet and back, looking at her in the classic style of the extrovert who wants you to drop whatever youre doing so that you can have a conversation with him.After exchanging a few words with Beled, he settled in to work on his own report, and the cabin was quiet for a while.Later the two men broke out some rations and had a snack, talking of this and that.Kath Two was snapped out of her work reverie by a mild shift in their tone of voice.Now they were talking about something important.Not in an urgent or concerned way.A glance at the display told her what it was: they were nearing the ring, which meant that they were about to lance through the twenty kilometer wide gap between two space habitats.There was no reason that this should be a problem, but it was the sort of feat that focused ones attention and brought a discernible edge to ones voice.She reached up and found the lever on her varp that activated an opaque screen over the lenses: essentially, a blindfold.Her view of the cabin was now blocked.The only things she could see were those being projected into her eyes by the varp.At the same time she activated an application that gave her the ability to see the flivvers surroundings as if she were floating adrift in space.The same service could have been provided by a bubble of glass on the flivvers hull, but it wouldnt have been as good.It would have exposed the users head to cosmic radiation, and the contrasty light would have made it difficult to see certain things.The varp, on the other hand, played games with the lights dynamic range so that bright things were less so while dim things were bright enough to see; it gave everything a luminous warm quality that did not exist in reality.It was so far superior to looking at the world directly that many space suits eschewed transparencies altogether and just encased the wearers head in a radiation shielded dome with a varp on the inside.She was now looking at an enhanced view of the universe from their current location, which was just inside, but rapidly approaching, the habitat ring.The ring was spinning past them.It was a little like being on the inside of a carousel watching the horses wheel by, except that instead of horses, these were space habitats as much as thirty kilometers across, and they were moving at three thousand meters per second.The task was to shoot between two of them without getting hit.By the standards of orbital mechanics it was no great feat, but it looked shockingly dangerous, and as such it was great fun to watch.As Kath Two looked straight ahead, the habitats seemed to be whizzing across their path like the teeth of a buzz saw.But through an apparent miracle the flivver found a gap between two of them.Whip dock in three, announced a synthesized voice, and Kath Twos hands moved around to check the straps holding her into her seat.An immense bullwhip was burgeoning toward them.Its general dimensions were about those of an exceptionally long Old Earth freight train, but instead of boxcars it was made up of many flynks coupled nose to tail into a chain.If Rhyss earlier preparations had gone according to planand Kath Two would have heard about it, were that not the casethen, several hours ago, the hundreds of flynks that lived in this whip station had begun to assemble themselves into a chain.When it had reached the desired lengthwhich was a function of the specific mission to be performedthe chain had joined itself nose to tail into an endless loop and gone into motion, driven by a simple linear motor in the whip station.It had formed an elongated oval known as an Aitken loop and then devoted some time to tweaking its shape and dialing in its exact velocity.Flynks were simple beasts, consisting mostly of structure: solid aluminum cast into certain shapes.Each flynk had a knuckle amidships, enabling it to bend freely in both directionsin mechanical engineering terms, it was just a heavy duty universal joint.Fore and aft it had couplers that enabled it to form a strong, rigid connection with other flynks.Somewhere in all of that structure were a few grams of silicon that made it smart, and lines for carrying power and information down the length of the chain.A few moments ago, word had gone out to one of the flynks that it should decouple from the one behind it.This had happened just as it was emerging from the whip station.At the instant the coupler had disconnected, the system had stopped being an Aitken loop and started being a giant bullwhip.The nikshta very old mispronunciation of Knickstelle, referring to the U shaped bend at the apex of the loophad begun to propagate away from the whip station, towing the free end of the whip behind it, accelerating as it went, and rapidly building to thousands of meters per second of velocity.This was the thing Kath Two saw in the VR: the elbow in the whip, coming right at them.The free end was concealed behind it, but she knew that in a few moments it would come whipping around in a huge final burst of acceleration.All the energy was directed backward from the point of view of the bored crew members who were presumably monitoring all of this in the station at the handle end of the whip.They were moving a lot faster than the flivver.In order to make physical contact with the approaching craft, they had to reach back.And reach wasnt really the right term; they had to punch backward with explosive suddenness to match the flivvers much lower velocity.This was the kind of task that bullwhips were made for.Still, she couldnt help but flinch as the final few flynks snapped around toward them.The perspective on the VR was almost sickening.The eye was confused by the fact that the whip as a whole was moving away from them so rapidly, and yet its uncoiling tip was coming right at them.Any failure in the calculations and it would have either hurtled away from them, leaving them alone and adrift, or else smashed into them at hypersonic closing velocity and destroyed them as surely as a bolide strike during the Epic.Instead of which the two velocities matched perfectly and the last flynk in the chain was, just for a moment, right there in front of them, much like the hanger she had docked with earlier.Coupling, said the voice, unnecessarily since she could hear the mechanical connection being made and then feel the acceleration as the flivver was slapped sideways and then jerked forward by the momentum of the whip.Brace for stabilization.A polite way of saying that the situation in the whip was a little chaotic in the aftermath of the snap around.In general they were now being pulled forward with tremendous force, being brought up to a speed to match that of the whip station and all the other objects in the habitat ring.But the physics of the whip led to some side to side oscillation, some surges and lapses in the acceleration that could be dampened but not removed by the tiny adjustments of the flynks.Hebel has toggled, the voice confirmed.Hebel, like Knickstelle, was a term from the German; it was a lever at the base of the whip, anchored to the whip station and capable of flipping freely from one side to the other.It was, in effect, the arm that held the handle and cracked the whip, and shortly after the completion of the first crackthe one that had culminated in successful dockingit had snapped around to the other side of the station and initiated a second crack in the opposite direction.A new niksht had been formed, just at the place where the whip was attached to the hebel, and was beginning to accelerate forward, accelerating the flivver to the velocity it would need to accomplish the rest of the mission.The process lasted for about three minutes.The visual cues in her headset gave her mind the context: the buzz saw whirling past them seemed to slow down.Of course it was still moving at the same speed; in truth the flivver was speeding up to match its pace.But, from her point of view, the habitat ring stopped looking like a whirling dervish and began to resolve itself into a series of discrete objects, still rushing past them, but more and more slowly until the whole ring seemed to grind to a halt.And at that moment, something especially huge drifted into view: the Eye, dead in their path.Decoupling, the voice announced, and not a moment too soon, since the acceleration had become difficult to tolerate.Had they not broken their connection to the tip of the whip, the gee forces would have rendered them unconscious, then killed them, and finally ripped the flivver to shreds.Flynks were built to survive forces that humans and ordinary spacecraft could not.But the geometry and the timing of the niksht had been programmed so that it would bring them to their desired velocity and release them into their new trajectory just before the crisis that, in an Old Earth bullwhip, would have been signaled by the sharp bang of a sonic boom.Weightlessness returned, unless you counted a bit of corrective jostling from the flivvers thrusters.Kath Twos vision cleared and she swallowed a few times, trying to settle her stomach.The funny thing was that the entire procedure, from Kath Twos landing her glider in the hanger, to the bolo release, to the just concluded interaction with the whip, would have looked graceful, even gentle, when viewed from a distance.In order to understand the sheer intensity of the acceleration and the jostling, you had to live through it.Trying to think about something other than her stomach, she took a good look at the Eye.Right now it was encircling Akureyri, a big (population 1.1 million), newish (eighty four years old) habitat constructed in the style known informally as the double barrel, historically known as the ONeill Island Three type.It was two large cylinders, parallel to each other, rotating in opposite directions.Each was enshrouded in complexes of mirrors and other infrastructure.The mirrors were aimed at the sun, whose light was bounced through windowed strips on the cylinder walls to illuminate the landscapes within.But it was about six in the evening local time, and so those mirrors were gradually being feathered to simulate twilight.By using the varp to zoom in, Kath Two could have peered through the windows to see the farms, forests, waterways, and habitations inside Akureyri, but she knew generally what it would look like, so she remained zoomed out for now.Which she had to, if she was going to take in the Eye.Akureyri, big as it was, was dwarfed by the construct surrounding it.Of this, the most eye catching part was the Manhattan on a roller coaster spectacle of the Great Chain, whipping around at terrific speed, completing a full circuit every five minutes.But that wasnt where they were going.As the Eye became larger and larger in her view, its whirling iris drifted to one side, and it became clear that the flivvers tiny corrective burns had aimed them toward one of those inhabited bits contained within its massive, pitted iron frame: a ring of four score docking ports encircled by a large, glowing yellow letter Q that was universally recognizable as the logo and the badge of Quarantine.At a glance, two thirds of the ports in the Q were already occupied by other ships, mostly flivvers of various types plus a couple of liners.The ports were individually numbered with glowing digits, and annotated, in the mixture of Latin and Cyrillic used throughout the ring, as to their purposes: TRANZIT IMMIGRAON MILITARY CURVEY CPE A ring of green lights surrounding a vacant portnumber 65began to flash.The systems that were controlling the flivver already knew where to go, so this was solely for the benefit of human beings, as well as serving as a backup plan in the rare event that a vehicle needed to be piloted by hand.Kath Two had seen enough dockings in her time, so she peeled off the varp and held it in her lap through the ensuing series of nudges and jerks, which terminated with the opening of the airlock door.A yellow striped tube stretched away into the part of Quarantine set aside for people who, like them, were returning from the surface of Earth.A few meters in, they were confronted by a one way door, constructed so that only one person at a time could pass through it.Hanging on a rack nearby were a number of hard bracelets, color coded to indicate that they were intended for Survey personnel, also striped with machine readable glyphs.Kath Two selected one and ratcheted it around her wrist.After a moment, a red diode began to blink on its back and digits began to count time.She waved it at the door, which unlocked itself and allowed her to pass into the tube beyond.This part of the Q consisted essentially of plumbing: a snarl of human sized pipes that drained people away from incoming ships and let them pool in separate reservoirs until they had passed muster.Kath Two, Rhys, and Beled would be inspected visually for invasive species and pathogens, their clothes and equipment sterilized.There would be mandatory showers and scrubbings.Stool and blood samples would be taken and tested.Because they were Survey, however, little interest would be shown in their backgrounds, their politics, their emotional stability, their motivations.Survey personnel had already been vetted for that sort of thing.Depending on how busy the lab facilities were, it could take anywhere from six to twenty four hours.THE SUSPICION, FOLLOWED BY THE CERTAINTY, THAT KATH TWO WAS being detained crept up on her.After a few hours, she was given clearance to move freely about the common areas of the Qs no mans land: eateries, shops, lounges, and recreational facilities strung around a torus with about half a gee of simulated gravity.This meant that she had passed all the biological tests.But the bracelet continued to blink red.The digits counted up to a day, then a day and a half.She shifted her sleep schedule to Eye time and began to experience jet lag.The Q was pretty crowdedperhaps that figured into the delay.The Eye had, in the last couple of weeks, swept westward across the oldest, most densely populated regions of the Greenwich segment, headed for the Cape Verde boneyard and the Rio segment beyond.At such a location, close to a boneyard where the habitats were big and new, the Q would expect to see a large volume of in transit passengers: emigrants from older and more crowded places bound for big new habitats like Akureyri.It took decades to fully populate one of those things; their population was ramped up gradually as new housing was constructed and the life supporting ecosystem was cultivated and tuned.In a short while the Eye would reach the Cape Verde boneyard and the census in this place would drop to near zero: just a few workers going to jobs on new habitats, and some patient long range travelers.But for now the facilities in the no mans land were operating at capacity and there were queues for food and drink, especially at places that catered to families.For people often emigrated when they had small children who they thought would benefit from being planted in a clean new place where they could run around.So Kath Two told herself, for a while, that the delay was purely bureaucratic in nature, a result of too many emigrants and not enough Q staff on hand.But on the second day she noticed Beled in the recreation center, operating a resistance training device at some insane power level only usable by young male Teklans.Later, after he had showered, she caught up with him in a bar and he mentioned that he had seen Rhys headed for the exit with his bracelet flashing green.When was this?she asked.Yesterday, Beled said.Eight hours and twenty minutes after we docked.A few hours later, Kath Two and Beled vacated their single rooms and moved into a slightly larger double.They began sleeping together without having sex, which was a fairly common behavior pattern for Moiran/Teklan couples who scarcely knew each other.When Beled got an erection, which was fairly often, he would go into the tiny en suite bathroom and masturbate.This way of dealing with it was sufficiently common that for him to have behaved in any other way would have been noteworthy.She knew that she could rely on him to show impeccable discipline, and he knew that this was her expectation, and so it could go on indefinitely until one of them signaled a change.Unable to sleep, not as proficient as Beled at masturbation, she heaved his massive arm off her chest, a project akin to dragging an unconscious ten year old boy to the other side of the bed, and slipped out, looking for a place to kill time until she felt drowsy.At the cafeteria, waiting in line for chocolate, she found herself standing next to a small, lithe Julian woman in her sixties.The woman had been reading a book, or pretending to.As the wait stretched on she seemed to lose interest.She closed the book, stifled a yawn, and fixed her gaze on Kath Two.Back from the surface?This was obvious from the color of Kath Twos wristband.But Kath Two understood that the woman was just trying to strike up a conversation.Yes.Home for you?the woman asked, referring to the Eye.Im sort of between homes at the moment.Survey duty makes it hard to settle down.Ah, taking a little R & R on the Great Chain.Good for you.Kath Two understood perfectly well that this woman was a Quarantine agent.This was how the Q operated: not by interrogating you in a windowless room but by striking up a casual conversation.The purpose of these common areas was to supply a range of venues and opportunities.It was important not to be seen as dissimulating, so Kath Two said: I expect some R & R might happen, but really Im bound for Stromness.Ah, visiting a friend at university?Was it telling the truth to call Doc a friend?More of a mentor.A teacher, she said.Well, Ive heard Stromness is lovely.Never been.Many, perhaps most, who were probed in this way never even realized that they were talking to a Quarantine agent.That was because most people passed through the Q rarely, if at all; and when they did, they tended to be jumbled together with large groups of travelers in settings where this sort of conversation might easily be mistaken for idle chitchat.Kath Two was a sufficiently experienced traveler to know exactly what was going on.And the other woman knew that she knew.They would carry on with the charade anyway.Kath Two resisted the temptation to make trouble by asking the Julian where she had come from and where she was going.The woman would no doubt have some plausible story cued up.Obliging her to rattle it off would only waste time.As the queue crept forward, they came in view of a display panel above the counter, showing a scene from the Epic.The time code in the corner was A+3.139, placing it about a year and a half into the Big Ride.The footage was from an arkletnot Enduranceso this was most likely from the Swarm.There was simulated gravity, so the arklet had to be part of a bolo.Kath Two didnt recognize any of the people at first.They were, of course, all rootstock humans, clearly recognizable as not belonging to any of the seven current human races, but close enough that she could still feel what they were feeling.They spoke, like everyone else in the Epic, in the archaic accents of five thousand years ago.No Eves were currently in the frame.The only Eves in the Swarm, of course, had been Julia and Ada.So this was probably what they called sidestory, which was to say, video from the Epic that, while it didnt capture the words or the deeds of any of the Eves, was still deemed important enough to have been incorporated into the canon and to show up on playlists in locations like this caf.Kath Two had a vague sense that she had seen it before, many years ago, perhaps in school.She had lost track of days and time zones, but she was fairly sure that today was Julsday, and so any Epic scenes being broadcast in a place like this were most likely commemorative of something that Eve Julia had said or done.Happy Eve Day, she said, as a polite reflex, to the Julian standing next to her.Good day to you, the woman returned, which confirmed that today was in fact Julsday.Kath Two watched the scene long enough to get the gist of it.She was growingly certain that she remembered these people and their situation.The Seven Fat and Seven Thin was a bolo that had consisted of two heptads.One of them had experienced a breakdown in food production because of a contagious blight that had started in one of its arklets and eventually spread to the other six.The result was seven arklets full of starving people, connected by a long cable to seven arklets in which there was plenty to eat.They had worked out a system of sending spacewalkers up their respective cables to the center point where the two paws were latched together.There, care packages from the Seven Fat would be handed over to spacewalkers from the Seven Thin, who would descend back to the afflicted heptad and distribute the food.But seven arklets could not produce food for fourteen.All went hungry, and people in the Seven Thin began to die.The problem was exacerbated by the fact that this bolo had become separated from the main Swarm.The particular scene now being broadcast was a video conference between the starvelings of the Seven Thin and the only slightly better fed occupants of the Seven Fat, made more wrenching by the fact that family members and old friends had found themselves separated by that cable.Kath Two was sure she remembered it now.In a few minutes, they would establish radio contact with the White Arklet and bring Eve Julia into the conversation to ask for her advice.She would make a little speech about what they must do.The story would end with the Seven Thin cutting themselves loose from the bolo.They timed it in such a way that the Seven Fat would be flung back in the direction of the main swarm, ensuring their at least temporary survival, while the Seven Thin went hurtling away in the opposite direction.In effect, the doomed ones used themselves as propellant to save the others.The tale was made more complicated, and more poignant, by other details that Kath Two would be subjected to if she stood here watching it long enough.The Seven Thin heptad was one of the few that contained part of the Human Genetic Archive, and so its sacrifice had been part of the seemingly inexorable series of mishaps that had led to the Council of the Seven Eves and the creation of the new human races.And their decision to sacrifice themselves had not been unanimous; it had been preceded by a mutiny, and hand to hand fighting from one arklet to the next as a minority of the starvelings had attempted to save themselves by donning space suits and ascending the cable.The man who had fought his way to the control panel and mashed the button that had severed the bolo was named Julius Mwangi.There was a habitat named after him at thirty eight degrees, zero minutes east, hovering over his birthplace in Kenya.The zero minutes part being significant, since habitats lying on meridians were traditionally named after heroes of the Epic.All of that came back to Kath Twos mind during the time it took the caf workers to make her coffee.For, since it had become obvious that she was being interrogated, she thought it best to change her order from chocolate to something with a little more caffeine.This is on me, she said to the Quarantine agent, since it was traditional to do small favors for strangers on their Eve Day.Had this been Moirsday, someone else might have paid for her coffee.Oh, no, I couldnt, the woman said.Which was probably true on a literal level; she could not accept a favor from someone she was interrogating.But if you would allow me to sit with you ...Of course, Kath Two said, and waited while the womans coffee was made.The screen above the counter had cut to a different part of the Epic, consisting of a conversation that had taken place aboard Endurance shortly before the Final Burn, in which Dinah and Ivy had talked each other into believing that Julia wasnt as bad as all that.Kath Two had always found it a little cloying.People quoted lines from it all the time.It had served as the basis for political movements and parties that had sought to build stronger alliances between the Julians and other races.As such, its timing was fortuitous.Had Kath Two been of a Julian turn of mind, shed have wondered whether the whole thing had been staged, the playlists timing rigged by someone behind the scenes at Quarantine so that she would see it just before sitting down to coffee with this woman.Because that was how Julians were.It was the choice that Eve Julia had made during the Council of the Seven Eves.Her strain, living in relative isolation in their segment of the ring, had intensified it through the selective breeding process known as Caricaturization.Julians had developed huge eyes, sleek ears, and small mouths as part of that; it was the single easiest way to identify one from across the room.The woman saluted before sitting down.Julians saluted with their left hands, kept off to the side of the face so that the hand never passed through the eyeline.Ariane, she said.A common Julian name, derived from the rockets launched from Kourou, which Eve Julia had defended by nuking the Venezuelans.Ariane Casablancova.Meaning that she was the daughter of a woman named Casablanca, after the White House.Kath Two saluted back.Kath Amalthova Two.For Kath Twos mother had been named after the asteroid that had sheltered Moira and her lab through the Big Ride.Ariane sat down across from her, huge eyes fixed impassively on Kath Twos face.Look, Kath Two said, Im no good at this.I dont belong to any kupol and I dont want to join.Just ask me what is on your mind.Just wondering if you saw anything interesting on the surface.My whole point in going there is to see interesting things.I hardly see anything that is not interesting.Ariane just sat expectantly.I filed a report, Kath Two said.And discussed its contents with Beled Tomov?Yes.But not with Rhys Alaskov.Rhys was asleep when Beled and I were talking.You slept quite a bit as well, Ariane remarked.Ten hours on the flivver.I had been flying a glider all day.With frequent naps.Every time a Moiran sleeps in a little bit, Kath Two said, it doesnt mean that we are going epi.Sometimes we are just tired, is all.Time will tell.Now you are journeying to have a face to face conversation with your mentor, Ariane said.Or so you think.What does that mean?Dr.Hu is not on Stromness.You would know as much if you had coordinated with him.But you didnt.Instead you made an impulsive plan, spur of the moment, to visit a place with which you have good associations.Somethings troubling you.You are aware that you might be starting to go epi.You wont discuss it with Doc until you are face to face with him, in a place where you feel safe.It must be something you observed on the surface.Something unexpected.Telling Ariane Casablancova to read Kath Twos report wouldnt help.Probably she had already perused it several times.She wanted to hear the story fresh.I might have seen a human, Kath Two said.Might?It was a glimpse.From a distance.Not another surveyoror else you wouldnt see anything remarkable in it.Surveyors wear bright clothes, for visibility.Beled didnt.When he was passing near the RIZ, no, of course not.Im speaking in general.Go on.This person was wearing the opposite.Sort of like Like what?You ever see pre Zero videos with hunters?They used to wear clothes that would make them less visible.Camouflage, Ariane said.Yeah.I think this person was in camouflage.Not a surveyor, then.Somilitary, perhaps?Kath Two asked.But the only purpose of military is to fight other military.And Im pretty sure theres no other military down there.Unless theres been some kind of infraction.But if thered been an infraction, Id have been warned of it before I was dropped.Hell, theyd have sent a Thor after me.Did it occur to you that it might be a fresh infraction?Which you were the first to notice?The question kind of hung there.Arianes implication was clear.If Kath Two had witnessed anything of the sort, she ought to have reported it immediately instead of sleeping for ten hours and then making a harebrained effort to find Doc in a place where he wasnt.No, she said.Thats not what this was.How do you know?I was making passes over the lake for a long time.I was clearly visible.Anyone who was there for no good reason would have simply hidden in the trees until I was gone.Thats not what this person did.They were down near the shore in a place where they could get a clear view of what I was doing.Like Like what?Ariane asked.Like they were gawking.After a long silence, Ariane repeated the word, Gawking.Yeah.Until this point, Kath Two had felt uncomfortable under Arianes gaze, but now she looked directly into the great penetrating eyes for a while.When this person moved, Ariane said, did you get any sense as to posture and gait?I dont think it was a Neoander, Kath Two said, shaking her head.That I would have reported.Ariane blinked and said, The simplest explanation is, of course ...An Indigen.Which is the possibility I discussed with Beled.She was feeling a little on the defensive now.But what would one be doing there?So far from the nearest RIZ.It is a mystery.Yes.That explains why you broke profile, Ariane said, nodding.I dont even know what broke profile means to you people.Did you ever get the sense that you were being watched?Followed?Ariane Casablancova had the damnable habit of asking good questions.You have to assume, when youre down there, that That you are not going unnoticed by local megafauna.Of course.Over time, hiking solo, trying to be aware of that, it can make you sort of, I dont know She didnt want to use the word paranoid around a Julian, since it was a racially charged word.Ariane seemed to sense this, and found it ever so slightly amusing.She leaned forward slightly, trying to help Kath Two over the sticky place.You develop a heightened awareness.Perhaps, to be safe, you interpret the sounds of the wilderness In the most conservative possible way, yeah.Like, the morning of my departure I was awakened by patches of light moving around on my tent.I thought for a minute that it might be caused by the movement of a large animal, passing between me and the sun.Then I emerged from the tent and saw that it had just been my imagination, that the light was shining between tree branches that were moving in the wind.Interesting!That heightened awareness of things, over a long enough span of time, does seem just like the sort of stimulus that could trigger an epigenetic shift in a Moiran, Ariane said.The thought had occurred to me.You didnt mention it in your report.This was the first time Ariane had come out and admitted that shed read the report, and so it pulled Kath Two up short.She was distracted by a large Teklan entering the caf with a green bracelet on his wrist.But it wasnt Beled.Just another surveyor, recently arrived, perhaps part of the same dragnet.Obviously Beled had filed a very complete report, including his conversation with Kath Two on the flivver.From another type of person she might have found this an irritating indiscretion, but for a Teklan it was to be expected.I didnt mention it in my report, Kath Two said, because in my judgment it was only my imagination, not a genuine, reportable Survey event.If you dont object to my going all juju This was a self deprecating term for Julian style cognition.Go ahead.Perhaps your initial impression was correct, and it was, in fact, caused by a large animala humanpassing between you and the sun.A mistake committed by someone who was watching you furtively.And when heIll call him a henoticed his shadow on your tent, he realized hed blundered, and withdrew down the slope into the woods, and watched you from there.It is entirely possible, Kath Two said.Out of politeness she refrained from adding that it was the kind of thing that could only have been spun from a Julian mind.How has your sleep been since then?Very sporadic and jet laggy, which is why Im here.I think it is possible that I might have started to go epi on the last day, but now that Im back in civilization my system is confused, and the shift is being aborted.Here, Kath Two might have reached up to feel her own face had she been sitting across the table from a Moiran friend.Do I look different?But Ariane would have no way of knowing the answer.Kath Two added, Ive been sleeping with Beled.I think that is helping pull me back.Very well.I hope your adjustmentwhether or not it includes becoming Kath Amalthova Threeis a smooth one.Am I free to leave?Its not my decision.Your status remains indefinite.Afraid Ill blab about it?Its not for me to be afraid about such things.My personal advice?Dont blab about it.But you know your rights.You cant be detained just because you think you might have seen a camouflaged gawker in the middle of nowhere.Ariane seemed to consider her next move before adding, Otherwise youd see a lot more Survey people bottled up in this caf.ARIANE WAS RIGHT ABOUT DOC.HE HAD LEFT HIS HOME IN THE misty campus of Stromnessa habitat in the predominantly Ivyn part of the ring, consisting entirely of universityand was en route to Cradle.Along the way he was spending a bit of time on the Great Chain.So when Kath Two finally took the obvious step of getting in touch with him directly, he responded within a few minutes and told her where he could be found.At about the same time, the diode on Kath Twos wristband turned green, informing her that she was free to leave.She went to the room shed been sharing with Beled to find that he had already departed.She gathered up her sterilized possessions and went to the exit, where the robot that was the door inspected her wristband.Apparently it liked what it saw, because it unlocked itself and allowed her to pass through.At the same moment the wristband sprang free and went dark.On her way out she tossed it into a bin.Half an hours floating along Eye passageways took her to the On Ramp, where she piled onto a capsule along with two dozen other visitors, strapped herself in, and was fired like a bullet down a gun barrel whose muzzle, at just the right moment, synched up with an arrival platform on the Great Chain.One gee of simulated gravity took effect as they were swept up into the rotation of the circular city.Attendants, stationed near the capsules exit door, helped the new arrivals onto the platform and looked each one in the eye to make sure they were all right.People who werent accustomed to sudden shifts in gravity were apt to suffer from dizzy spells or worse.Most of the attendants were Camites.This was a considered choice, ratified by many centuries of practice.Even the most hot blooded Dinan would be willing to admit to one of these unassuming people that he was feeling woozy.The elaborate Dinan code of chivalry obliged them to show special politeness to Camites, whom they identified as weak and childlike.Kath Two walked with only minor unsteadiness toward the top of a moving stairway that would take her down to the mass transit level.The ceiling above was high and arched, like a grand Old Earth train station, and its nickel iron fretworks were atwitter with birds, a whole society of them going about its internecine trends and controversies while keeping an eye on the human traffic below.Specialized siwis, wrapped around the struts and girders like pythons around tree branches, moved along at a rate too gradual for the birds to notice, cleaning off their shit.The birds were all the same species, called the grizzled crow: a small corvid, half of whose feathers were devoid of pigment, giving it a salt and pepper appearance.This feature had been added by its designers simply as a visual flag so that they could be easily distinguished from rootstock crows.They moved in wheeling gray cyclones through the vaulted space overhead, but they were also comfortable shooting up and down the angled shafts that connected it to the transit level below.As Kath Two walked along the platform, a single one of those birds peeled away from a spiraling and squawking murder and dove toward her.As it hied in closer she became more and more certain that it was homing in on her face.It pulled up just short of colliding with her and, lacking a place to perch, hovered before her in ungainly style, treading air and slipping backward to match her pace.The grove in the temperate rain forest, it said, or as near as a crow could come to pronouncing those words, and then beat air and took off, rising toward the rafters but then banking hard down the slanted tube that would take it back into the transit.Nor was it the only grizzled crow that was completing such an errand; similar encounters were happening all around her.Perhaps a score of the birds were perched on the safety railing that surrounded the entrance to the moving stair, muttering things that they had heard from humans.One of them, who perhaps had listened to a couple making love, was producing a crows approximation of an orgasmic moan.Three of them were singing a popular song in unison.One was barking like a dog.A few were trying to cadge food from people who were carrying snacks.One of them just kept repeating meet me at the train station at dot sixteen, another Ill be wearing a red scarf.At the bottom of the moving stair the crows were flying in and out of snug little rookeries that had been built for them at the ends of the tube cars, so that they wouldnt foul the seats.Ten minutes on one of those cars took Kath Two to Aldebrandi Gardens.This was a series of six consecutive blocks that had been constructed as botanical preserves.Each consisted of a rectangular slab of ecosystem covered by a lofty arched glass roof under which simulated Earth landforms had been built.The temperature and humidity of each had been tuned to simulate a different part of Old Earth.Plants and other organisms, sequenced from digital records, had been cultivated here, and supplemented later with birds, insects, and small animals.Creatures fostered and studied here had later been disseminated to factories in other parts of the ring where theyd been propagated in vast numbers and used to seed New Earth.Starting at the hot end, Kath Two walked through a Southeast Asian jungle so humid that moisture condensed on her face before she could even begin to perspire.No sky was visible beneath its triple canopy, but when she stepped through the next airlock into Chihuahuan desert, she was treated to a direct view up through its ceiling into space, and blasted with sunlight bounced in by a robotic mirror mounted outside.Hanging up there in the center of the Great Chain was a little habitat called Surtsey.For during Kath Twos stay in Quarantine, the Eye had moved on from Akureyri, passed the even larger habitat of Sean Probst at twenty degrees west, and was now entering a sort of boundary zone on the edge of the Cape Verde boneyard.She knew nothing of Surtsey, but it looked like a placeholder habitat, a sort of construction shed that would be used as the basis for something planned a minute or two west of here.Her skin and hair dried out instantly under the sun, and by the time she reached the end of the block, she almost wished shed stayed below in the tunnels, where she neednt have worried about cactus spines and rattlesnakes.The next ecosystem was Fynbos, the characteristic environment of the Cape of Good Hope, cooler but no less sunny, a riot of scrappy flowering plants, a favorite of picnickers and birdwatchers from elsewhere in the Great Chain.It was a little too crowded for her taste, and so she marched straight down its length, trying not to be distracted by its many small charms, and entered the next block.This was almost more aquarium than terrarium, being a simulation of Old Earth Louisiana bayou.A plank walkway snaked among its moss covered trees, carrying her over teeming reptile infested waters to the airlock at its far end, where she stopped to pull a jacket out of her knapsack and don a pair of gloves.Eight hundred year old Douglas firs filled the next block from end to end.This one had been engineered to simulate the temperate rain forest of pre Zero British Columbia, so its roof had been equipped with filters that damped the sun down to a steady silver glow that seemed to come from all directions.The lack of shadows made it seem brighter, in its way, than the unobstructed sunlight in the Chihuahuan biome.Ferns, moss, and epiphytes grew on fallen logs so thickly that they seemed to have been sprayed from a hose.A skein of faint paths ran through it.Kath Two followed one of them to the Kupol Grove: a relatively open space near the center, ringed by particularly enormous trees, where she found Doc, four of his students, his aide, and his robot sitting on moss covered rocks and logs.Dr.Hu Noah and most of his students were Ivyn.In Docs case it was difficult to tell, since extreme old age tended to obscure racial differences.Hed lost his hair long ago, and his skin was blotchy from years spent down on the surface doing research in unfiltered sunlight.Limp skin dangled from his sharp cheekbones like wet laundry from the edge of a rock, and eventually joined into a system of wattles mostly concealed by a scarf wrapped around his neck.That, and other touches meant to keep him comfortable, had been seen to by his nurse, a stocky Camite wearing a knapsack full of medical supplies.Curled at Docs feet like a sleeping dog was a grabb with a display panel in its back showing live readouts of his vital signs, which it was monitoring through a bundle of wireless connections.A pole projected vertically from its back to about the level of Docs waist, where it forked to a pair of handlebars.It was a smart cane.When he grabbed the handlebars it would help him stand up.It would then steady his locomotion even on the roughest terrain, adding its six legs to his two.Docs students ranged in age from twenty to seventy.Kath Two had never met any of them before.There was nothing unusual in that; the TerReForm was the largest project ever undertaken by the human race, and 99 percent of it still lay in the future.She recognized the oldest ones face from pictures in scientific journals.She felt awkward.Walking into the clearing and making herself known to these people had required a kind of courage.There was a class system within TerReForm.Doc was at its apex.Survey personnel were not so much at its bottom as on its wild fringes.Not so much looked down upon as looked at askance, seen as not entirely serious.But they were polite.All except Doc greeted her with the Ivyn variant of the salute, an understated gesture that incorporated a suggestion of a bow.Doc held both of his hands out so that she could take them carefully in hers.He squeezed with surprising strength and she squeezed back.Then suddenly they were alone.Whether by prearrangement or because the other Ivyns had sensed something, they all withdrew.Even the nurse stepped away and contented herself with a stroll around the clearing, holding her hand up from time to time to check Docs readouts on a palm sized device.Youre coming to Cradle with me, he announced.There is need of a team.A new research project?she asked.Docs eyes closed for a moment in disagreement, then sprang open, gazing at her directly.A Seven, he corrected himself.Hmm.And Im to be One of us, yes.Doc said this as if it were obvious.But it wasnt, not to Kath Two.A Sevena group consisting of one person from each racewas usually assembled for some ceremonial purpose, like dedicating a new habitat or signing a treaty.Not Kath Twos thing at all.And even if it had been, she was confused by the suggestion that she was to be in the same Seven as Doc.Because usually, when a Seven was being assembled, some effort was made to have all the members be of like status.And this was decidedly not the case between her and Doc.The gap in age, fame, and eminence was almost too wide to measure.What could possibly make Kath Two special enough to deserve such an honor?Her confusion lasted for only a few moments before she saw it, so obvious: it was something to do with what she had seen on the surface.She saw faint amusement around Docs eyes as he watched her figuring it all out.This turned to a mildly apprehensive look as he perceived that Kath Two was getting ready to blurt something.And that alone caused her to stifle it.She said nothing.They would talk of it only when Doc felt it was time.Youve never been to Cradle before, he said.Thats correct.Well, it should be a new kind of adventure for you then.Ill try not to look like a tourist.Look like whatever you please, he said.Well be too busy to worry much about such things.When do we Twelve hours, give or take, he said, and looked over to the Camite.Is that about right, Memmie?Memmie nodded.Cabins have been booked on the elevator departing at twenty two thirty.Kath Two hadnt met Memmie before, but had heard about this person of indeterminate gender who kept Doc alive and looked after many of his affairs.Memmie was short for Remembrance, a common Camite name.At the moment Memmie seemed to be presenting as female, with a saronglike wrap around the waist of a coverall that was otherwise utilitarian in the extreme, appearing to consist entirely of cargo pockets.Some neck jewelry and a turbanlike head covering completed the ensemble.Her use of the passive voiceCabins have been bookedwas racially typical.Memmie, of course, had done the booking, made the other arrangements, and looked after the significant fund transfers needed to book a number of elevator cabins on short notice.But getting her to say that this had been her doing would have been like extracting teeth from her jaw.Some saw it as a becoming habit of humility; others saw it as irritatingly passive aggressive.Kath Two had no opinion.She had a few free hours on the Great Chain and needed to make the most of them.See you there, she said.I shall look forward to it, Doc answered.KATH TWO DESCENDED TO THE TRANSIT LEVEL AT THE END OF THE block and took the tube around the ring to a district of midrise blocks full of stores, markets, kupols, restaurants, and theaters, and spent the day drifting around, looking at things, buying little except for small items of clothing and toiletries she imagined she might need on the next leg of her journey.Square meter for square meter, this was the finest shopping district in the human universe, drawing its stock from every habitat visited by the Eye, attracting the sophisticated and well heeled natives of the Great Chain as well as tourists from whichever habitats were currently in reach.She was feeling a kind of vague ambient pressureenhanced, no doubt, by the advertising that walled her in on all sidesto buy clothes, or try on jewelry, or get a hairstyle that would make her fit in better on Cradle.That was a place for people more important than Kath Two: brisk, poised paragons in uniforms or smart outfits, speed walking down corridors in murmuring clusters, exchanging glances across lobbies.Kath One had been much more susceptible to those kinds of social influences and would have been emptying her bank account at this moment, trying to silence the little voice in her head telling her she wasnt pretty or stylish enough.But Kath One had died at the age of thirteen and been replaced by Kath Two, whose brain had a rather different set of emotional responses.It wasnt that she was unafraid.Everyone was afraid of something.Kath Two was afraid that she would make the wrong choices, and make a fool and a spectacle of herself, if she tried to dress up to Cradles standards.Better to lurk, observe, and merge, as she did when flying in a glider.On her way back down to the tube, she happened to pass by a bookstall, where she picked up a paper copy of one of her favorite history books and downloaded a whole series of novels set on Old Earth.The paper copy was an extravagance, something she would add to her little library the next time she made it to one of her caches.For like a lot of young Moirans, Kath Two didnt even try to establish a fixed home.With a home came a social circle, and perhaps a family.All of which was fine for the people of the other races.But until a Moiran took a set, such permanent arrangements were unwise, placing husband, children, coworkers, and friends at risk of waking up one day to find that their wife, mother, colleague, or pal had effectively died and been replaced by someone else.So rather than renting apartments, young Moirans opted for storage caches in places they were wont to visit.Sometimes it was a shelf in a friends closet, sometimes a locker in a Survey or military base, sometimes a commercial niche in a big city with a robot doorkeeper that would ID you.Abandoned caches were legion, their contents forever being sold at auction.Kath Two was the sort of person whose caches were apt to be crammed with paper books.For her, the electronic books were an insurance policy of sorts.The four day elevator ride might be nothing more than a prelude to further journeys, some of which might take her to places with little to no bandwidth, and nothing was worse than getting stuck in a situation like that with nothing to read.Elsewhere on the Great Chain was a block long historical museum, stacked by era, with one floor for each millennium, beginning with the pre Zero world on the ground floor and proceeding upward.Of course, very few physical artifacts remained from pre Zero, so that floor consisted mostly of pictures and reconstructed environments.But the Arkies had been allowed to bring a few possessions into space with them, and some of those had survived the Epic and the ensuing five thousand years.So it was possible to look at actual smartphones and tablets and laptops that had been manufactured on Old Earth.They did not work anymore, but their technical capabilities were described on little placards.And they were impressive compared to what Kath Two and other modern people carried around in their pockets.This ran contrary to most peoples intuition, since in other areas the achievements of the modern worldthe habitat ring, the Eye, and all the restwere so vastly greater than what the people of Old Earth had ever accomplished.It boiled down to Amistics.In the decades before Zero, the Old Earthers had focused their intelligence on the small and the soft, not the big and the hard, and built a civilization that was puny and crumbling where physical infrastructure was concerned, but astonishingly sophisticated when it came to networked communications and software.The density with which theyd been able to pack transistors onto chips still had not been matched by any fabrication plant now in existence.Their devices could hold more data than anything you could buy today.Their ability to communicate through all sorts of wireless schemes was only now being matchedand that only in densely populated, affluent places like the Great Chain.There was no telling, of course, what was going on in the Red zone between the turnpikes.Signals intelligence shining out into space from their part of the habitat ring suggested that the Adans were at least as advanced, in their use of mobile communications, as people here.Because they were also quite good at encryption, there was no way of telling what they were saying to one another.But Blue, for its part, had made a conscious decision not to repeat what was known as Tavs Mistake.It was unfair, of course, for billions of people to focus blame on one representative of his culture who had died in a bad way five thousand years ago.The Epic, however, tended to have this effect on peoples thinking.In the same way that certain people of Old Earth, raised on the Bible, would have referred to masturbation as the Sin of Onan, those of the modern world tended to classify personal virtues and failings in terms of well known historical figures from the era of the Cloud Ark, the Big Ride, and the first generations on Cleft.Fair or not, Tavistock Prowse would forever be saddled with blame for having allowed his use of high frequency social media tools to get the better of his higher faculties.The actions that he had taken at the beginning of the White Sky, when he had fired off a scathing blog post about the loss of the Human Genetic Archive, and his highly critical and alarmist coverage of the Ymir expedition, had been analyzed to death by subsequent historians.Tav had not realized, or perhaps hadnt considered the implications of the fact, that while writing those blog posts he was being watched and recorded from three different camera angles.This had later made it possible for historians to graph his blink rate, track the wanderings of his eyes around the screen of his laptop, look over his shoulder at the windows that had been open on his screen while he was blogging, and draw up pie charts showing how he had divided his time between playing games, texting friends, browsing Spacebook, watching pornography, eating, drinking, and actually writing his blog.The statistics tended not to paint a very flattering picture.The fact that the blog posts in question had (according to further such analyses) played a seminal role in the Break, and the departure of the Swarm, only focused more obloquy upon the poor man.Anyone who bothered to learn the history of the developed world in the years just before Zero understood perfectly well that Tavistock Prowse had been squarely in the middle of the normal range, as far as his social media habits and attention span had been concerned.But nevertheless, Blues called it Tavs Mistake.They didnt want to make it again.Any efforts made by modern consumer goods manufacturers to produce the kinds of devices and apps that had disordered the brain of Tav were met with the same instinctive pushback as Victorian clergy might have directed against the inventor of a masturbation machine.To the extent that Blues engineers could build electronics of comparable sophistication to those that Tav had used, they tended to put them into devices such as robots.Clefts initial population had been eight humans and hundreds of robots (thousands, if nats were counted as individuals).Both numbers had expanded since then.Only in the last century had the human population pulled even with that of non nat robots.The end result, for a young woman in a bookstall above a tube station on the Great Chain, was that she was dwelling in habitats, and being moved around by machines, far beyond the capabilities of Old Earth.She was being served and looked after by robots that were smarter and more robust than their ancestorsthe Grabbs and so on that Eve Dinah had programmed on Izzy.And yet the information storage capacity of her tablet, and its ability to connect, were still limited enough that it made sense for her to download books over a cable while that was easy, and to make room for them in the tablets storage chips by deleting things she had already read.That sorted, she rode transit to the Off Ramp, where she climbed into a capsule, facing backward, and felt deceleration push her back into her couch as it was flung off the Great Chain into a tube lined with electromagnetic decelerators.Back now in the zero gee environment of the Eyes nonrotating frame, she began to navigate its internal companionways, pushing herself along lighted tubes marked with the icon of Cradle: a pair of mountains enclosed within a semicircular dome.This led her, within a few minutes, to a transit station where she and two random strangers climbed into a four person bubble that presently went into motion and began to whoosh at greater and greater speed down a long and perfectly straight tube.They were traveling from the rim of the great Eyes iris out to its inner vertex, the one closest to Earth, a distance of some eighty kilometers, and so hand over handing their way down a shaft wasnt an option.Kath Two, who had been awake now for something like sixteen hours, felt herself dozing off.She jerked awake near the end of the trip, convinced that she had heard her name being spoken.The pod had a video screen on its front bulkhead, and one of the other passengers, to pass the time, had begun playing back a segment of the Epic that must have taken place around twenty years after Zero.This could be guessed from the visible signs of aging on the faces of the surviving Eves, and from the fact that the first generation of their offspring were adolescents.This segment of the Epic told the story of how a personal rift between Eve Dinah and Eve Tekla had been mediated and settled by some of the youngsters, led by Catherine Dinova.It was frequently pointed to as one of the first moments when the children of the Eves had begun to think and take action for themselves.Lines of dialogue from it were quoted frequently in modern day discussions.Kath Two wondered, as she always did, whether the people of the Epic would have said and done some of what they had, had they known that, five thousand years later, billions of people would be watching them on video screens, citing them as examples, and quoting them from memory.Over the first few decades on Cleft, the cameras had died one by one.Depending on how you felt about ubiquitous surveillance, the result had either been a new Dark Age and an incalculable loss to history, or a liberation from digital tyranny.Either way, it signaled the end of the Epic: the painstakingly recorded account of everything that the people of the Cloud Ark had done from Zero onward.After that it had all been oral history for about a thousand years, since there had been no paper to write on and no ink to write on it with.Memory devices were scarce and jury rigged.Every single chip had been used for critical functions such as robots and life support.A tone sounded, warning the passengers of deceleration, and the pod eased to a stop in the terminal.Even after it had come to rest, however, they experienced a mild sense of gravity.It was too faint to be perceived other than as an annoying tendency for objects not otherwise constrained to drift downward, where down in this part of the Eye meant toward the Earth.To prevent that drift from getting out of hand, some floors of lightweight decking had been constructed.But the gravity was still so faint that you could fly around by pushing off against anything solid.Kath Two collected her bag, strapped it to her back, and glided out into the terminal.The other travelers from her pod seemed to know where they were going and so she followed them down through staggered gaps in those decks.This part of the Eye was bare bones in an almost literal sense; it was where the massive structural limbs that held the whole thing together converged to a sharp point, aimed forever at Earth.The metal was honeycombed with tunnels and cavities engineered for various purposes.The carbon cables that held Cradle suspended above Earths atmosphere some thirty six thousand kilometers below diverged here and ran taut through long sheltered passageways all the way to the other end of the Eye, where they came together again and emerged to connect with the Big Rock beyond.The passageways and chambers used by humans were tiny by comparison.Set into the very point of the Eye was a glass dome, half a dozen meters in diameter.From it you could look straight down the bore of the tetherwhich was actually a tubular array of sixteen smaller tendonsand see the Earth.From this distance, the planet looked about as big as a persons face seen from across a small table.An Old Earther, seeing it from here, might think at first that nothing had ever changed.It still had the same general look: blue oceans, white icecaps, green and brown continents partly obscured by swirling white vortices of weather.Those continents stood in roughly the same places as the old ones, for not even the Hard Rain could make much of a dent in a tectonic plate.But the landforms had been radically resculpted, with many inland seas, and deep indentations in coastlines, created by large impacts.New island chains, frequently arc shaped, had been created by ejecta and by volcanic activity.The Eye was always above the equator; currently it hovered over a spot about halfway between Africa and South America, whose coasts echoed each others shape in a way that made their tectonic history obvious even to nonscientists.The low lying terrain along both coastlines had huge bites taken out of it, frequently with rocky islands jutting out in the centers of the bites: central peaks of big impact craters.Archipelagoes reached out into the Atlantic but trailed off well short of joining the two continents.The geography of New Earth, though beautiful to look at, made little impression on Kath Two, since she had been studying it her whole life and had spent years tromping around on it.For now, her attention was captured by the giant machines in which the view was framed.Surrounding her, and just visible in her peripheral vision, was another of those ubiquitous tori, spinning around to provide simulated gravity for the staff who lived here with their families, looking after the tether and the elevator terminal.Inward of that were the sixteen orifices where the tethers primary cables were routed into the frame of the Eye.Each of those cables, though it looked solid from a distance, was actually made of sixteen more cables, and so on and so forth down to a few fractal iterations.All of these ran parallel between the Eye and Cradle.Webbing them together was a network of smaller diagonal tendons, arranged so that if one cable broke, neighboring ones would take the force until a robot could be sent out to repair it.Cables broke all the time, because theyd been hit by bolides or simply because they had aged out, and so if you squinted your eyes and looked closely enough at the tether, you could see that it was alive with robots.Some of these were the size of buildings, and clambered up and down the largest cables simply to act as mother ships for swarms of smaller robots that would actually effect the repairs.This had been going on, to a greater or lesser extent, for many centuries.This end of the cable had beanstalked downward from the Eye while the other had grown in the opposite direction, reaching out away from the habitat ring and from Earth, acting as a counterbalance.Cradle was much too small to be picked out at this distance.Even if it had been large enough to see, her view of it would have been blocked by the elevator, which was on its final approach, and expected to reach the terminal in about half an hour.It had a general resemblance to an Old Earth wagon wheel, with sixteen spokes reaching inward from its rim to a hotel sized spherical hub where the people were.Watching it approach produced the mildly alarming illusion that it was going to come crashing through the dome.In that case, two domes would have been destroyed in the collision, since the hub was capped by a dome similar to this one where passengers could relax on couches and gaze up at the view of the approaching Eye and the habitat ring spreading out to either side of it.But of course it slowed down and stopped short of contact.Through the glass, now just a stones throw away, she could see the new arrivals unbuckling their seat belts, gathering their things, and floating toward the exits.Most of them were wearing military uniforms, or else the dark, well designed clothing that she associated with comersants and politicos.Not really her crowd.But Doc had invited her, which was all the credentials anyone really needed.Through the flimsy internal partitions she could hear several dozen arrivals making their way to Quarantine.These were eventually bound either for the Great Chain or the much smaller torus that encircled this end of the tether.Through the dome she could see housekeeping robots, and a few human staff, making their sweep through the hubs lounge.After a few minutes, a green light came on above a door, and she joined a flow of a few dozen departing passengers.Within minutes she was ensconced in a small private cabin in the elevators hub, where she would spend the four day journey to the tethers opposite terminus.A chime warned her when the elevator began to accelerate downward, but it moved at a speed that was extremely modest by the normal standards of space travel, so she felt no need to strap in.She climbed into her bed and slept.THE ELEVATOR WAS A HOLLOW CYLINDER TEN STORIES HIGH, WITH A glass dome at each end, one aimed up at the Eye and the other aimed down at Earth.The floors beneath those domes were made of glass, so that the light shone through from end to end.The outer walls were windowless and heavily shielded against cosmic radiation, but on the inside, the cabins and lounges had windows onto the atrium.Or at least the more expensive cabins did; Kath Twos was at the periphery, hard up against the outer wall, with no windows other than a tiny porthole onto a ring shaped corridor.Which was fine with her.At the beginning of the journey they were in near weightlessness, but as the days went on, gravity would increase, reaching one normal gee at Cradle.She could tell when she woke up that she had not slept for long, since gravity was still quite faint, perhaps comparable to what had once existed on the moon.She wandered up and down the atrium looking for a place where she could sit and read her book.Several bars and restaurants fronted on it, but these were not places for Kath Two, as she could tell just from the look of the people and the prices quoted on the menus.Comfy looking chairs and couches were distributed around the glass floor of the atrium, and a coffee bar stood along one edge, so she ended up there.After an hour or so, Beled Tomov turned up and sat in her general vicinity but made no move to interrupt her reading.When she came to a good stopping place, she looked up and happened to notice Ariane Casablancova sitting on the opposite side of the atrium, working on a tablet.So they had five of the Seven: Doc, Memmie, Ariane, Beled, and Kath Two.The only two missing were the Dinan and, somewhat more problematically, the Adan.Kath Two and Beled ran into Doc and Memmie later when they wordlessly agreed to go to the least expensive of the eateries and get some food.Somewhat uncharacteristically, Doc was not surrounded by students, scholars, and TerReForm bigwigs.He was just sitting at one end of the room carefully eating soup.Memmie was at his elbow, reaching in frequently to tuck his napkin back into his collar.Neither of them reacted when Kath Two and Beled took seats at the same table, but after a few minutes Doc said, Lieutenant Tomov, it is good to see you again.Greetings, and the two of them exchanged salutes in their respective racial styles.Lieutenant, obviously, was a military and not a Survey rank, and so this confirmed the unsurprising fact that Beleds relationship to Survey was, at best, ambiguous.Much more interesting was the fact that he and Doc had already met.I hope that this assignment will not prove an inconvenience, Doc continued.All duty is inconvenient to a greater or lesser degree, or it would not be duty.I was thinking more of the advancement of your career, Lieutenant.In your future dossier, this will stand out as a highly anomalous episode.Depending on who is reading that dossier, it might help you or hurt you.I dont concern myself with such matters, Beled returned.Some would call that unwise, but I tend not to favor the company of such.You, on the other hand, will do nicely.May I ask why I was so honored?Docs eyes moved briefly to Kath Two.Kath here will be worried that its because she shared an indiscretion with you.Drew you into it.Or perhaps she is a little bit exasperated with you for having passed it on in your report.Kath Two shook her head no, but did not wish to interrupt Doc.Beled, however, seemed to take it in.Doc continued.None of that really counted.You are a known quantity, now, not only to me but also to Kath Two and to Ariane, which is somewhat useful.But even without all of that, you would have been a fine choice.Not everything must be for a reason.Never mind what our Julian friends say.He had noticed Ariane Casablancova approaching them, somewhat tentatively, with a tray of food.He made an almost subliminal gesture with his eyes toward Memmie, who stood up and fetched an extra chair from an adjoining table.Ariane joined them.Kath Two felt vaguely uncomfortable.A day earlier this woman had held and wielded power over her, had known things about her that would normally have been private matters.What was she to Kath Two now?Presumably an equal member of the Seven.Ariane had, of course, worked this all out ahead of time, and prepared for it.Kath Two and Beled, she said, our first meetings were in a formal bureaucratic setting that now leads to some awkward feelings.I look forward to reacquainting myself with both of you as a colleague.Noted, said Beled.Thank you, said Kath Two.But if anything she felt even more awkward now.Arianes little speech had not been delivered warmly.More like she was ticking her way down a checklist.In that vein, she now turned her searchlight eyes toward the other two.Dr.Hu.Remembrance.Doc, Doc said, and Memmie.It is good to make your acquaintances in person.These formal and somewhat chilly conversational gambits led nowhere, and so after an awkward silence Ariane tucked into her meal.Doc, Kath Two said, may we know what the hell we are doing?What is this Seven for?It looks like a Five to me, Doc said puckishly, somewhat breaking the tension.For Memmie, Ariane, and Beled had all aimed sharp looks at Kath Two, startled by the informal way in which she had just spoken to her old professor.Doc, who clearly didnt care, continued: When we are Sevenwhich will be in a few days, on Cradlethen I will explain it once, to everyone, at the same time.Fair enough, Kath Two said.What should we be doing in the meantime?All of the things you will look back on fondly later when you have not been able to do them for a long time.It was a lovely thought.Kath Two tried to be duly appreciative of the generous sentiment behind it during the remainder of the journey.But nothing of the sort really happened.She read more than she had intended to of the books she had acquired on the Great Chain.At meals, and in the recreation center, she placed herself in Beleds eye line, just in case he was in the mood.But things were different now.Their time together in the Q had been an ideal setup for a relationship of a casual and temporary nature.It had never gone beyond sleeping in the same bed, but it might have.The knowledge that they would probably never see each other again had made it easy to shack up for a couple of nights and enjoy each others company in a way that would have posed too many complications had they been working together.Now they were working together.Beled had wisely pulled back.She understood, and considered a certain amount of sexual frustration an acceptable price to pay for being prudent.She had two meals with Ariane, and in her spare time she made desultory attempts to learn more about the Julian from network searches.Kath Two assumed that all such search activity was being monitored and logged by someonepossibly someone who was in touch with Ariane through whatever agency Ariane worked for.As time went by, Kath Two was less and less certain that that was actually Quarantine.Or perhaps another way of saying it was that Quarantines public facethe people who talked to you when you were traveling between space habitatswas only one avatar of something that had to be much bigger and more complicated.In the same way that Survey and military were different things, and yet drawing a sharp line between them could be difficult, so it was with police and Quarantine.And once you broadened the scope to include police, you were talking about other things besides routine law and order work.At some level, intelligence and counterintelligence were under that umbrella.Kath Two had no way of guessing where Ariane fit into that system.Searching the network too avidly for personal details about Ariane Casablancova would have been noticed, and would have been a bad idea.Not searching at all would almost have been more suspicious.So Kath Two searched a little, and found less.Low level Q officers might be mentioned on the network from time to time, as the result of a police report or a public relations initiative, but there was nothing of the sort for Arianeassuming that this was even her real name.A compulsion for privacy was hardly unusual for a Julian living and working in Blue.The Julian part of the ring, centered on the Tokomaru habitat, was the least populous of the eight segments.Ninety five percent of it lay on the Red side of the turnpike.Only a tiny sprinkling of habitats projected east of Kiribati into the Blue zone, and in those the Julians had been diluted by the more numerous and aggressive Teklans, whose segment lay just on the far side of the Hawaii boneyard.Thus the Julians had maintained enough of a presence in Blue that they could live and work in it without being seen as aliens, or immigrants.Many of them were dukhos, playing approximately the same role in modern society as priests had done pre Zero.The destruction of Old Earth and the reduction of the human population to eight had done for the idea that there was a God, at least in any sense remotely similar to how most pre Zero believers had conceived of Him.Thousands of years had passed before anyone, even in the most remote outposts of human settlement, had dared to suggest that religion, in anything like its traditional sense, might be or ought to be revived.In its place a new set of thoughtways had grown up under the general heading of dukh, a Russian word referring to the human spirit.Dukh based institutions had developed under the general term of kupol, a word that harked back to the glass bubble that had served as a kind of interfaith chapel and meditation room on Endurance.Modern day kupols all traced their origins back to that structure, which Dubois Harris had called the Woo Woo Pod.When people nowadays watched scenes from the Epic that took place in it, they were in the backs of their minds thinking of their local kupols and the people who staffed them.A professional member of a kupols staff was generally called a dukho, a truncation of the Russian word dukhobor, meaning one who wrestled with spiritual matters.Kupols, like churches of old, were supported by contributions from their members.Some, as on the Great Chain, were richly endowed, magnificent buildings.Others, like the one in the Q, were just quiet rooms where people could go to think or to seek help from what amounted to social workers.Dukhos tended to trace their lineage back to Luisa, who had played a similar role during the Epic, and some of the better educated ones drew explicit connections between their kupols and the Ethical Culture Society, where Luisa had gone to school in New York.But Luisa, of course, had not produced a race.The dukho profession had ended up being dominated by Julians.The Julian habitat of Astrakhan, which hovered anomalously in the middle of the Dinan segment, had become a sort of hothouse for the production of dukhos of various denominations.Kath Two was able to establish that Ariane had originated from there, but little else.It was fine.There were ample reasons for Ariane to keep to herself and lead a quiet life.MOST OF THE GIANT NICKEL IRON MOON CORE FRAGMENT NAMED Cleft had been melted down and reshaped into what was now the Eye.The engineers had not been able to bring themselves, however, to destroy the part of it immediately surrounding the place where Endurance had come to rest at the end of the Big Ride, and where the bodies of Doob, Zeke Petersen, and other heroes of the Epic had been interred directly into iron catacombs.That patch of the asteroidthe deep, shielded declivity where the first several generations of the new human races had lived out their entire liveshad come to be known as Cradle.Everyone had, of course, seen the chapter from the Epic where Doob had gone out on his last space walk with Eve Dinah, looked up at the walls of iron rising from the valley floor, and foreseen that one day a ceiling of glass would be built over the top, turning the Vale of the Eves into a huge greenhouse where children would be able to float about unencumbered by space suits, eating fresh greens from terraced gardens.It was probably the biggest tearjerker in the whole Epic, and a perennial favorite.All of Doobs predictions had, of course, come true.Cradle had ended up supporting a population of several thousand, until later generations had been obliged to push outward.Cradles main defect had been a lack of simulated gravity, which had obliged those early generations to construct what amounted to glorified merry go rounds on which children could take turns being centrifuged in order to foster bone growth.Subsequent habitatsspinning tori mounted to the walls of the clefthad actually been more crowded and confined than Izzy itself, and many generations had lived cramped lives in them with only occasional opportunities for R & R in Cradles sunny open volumes.In time they had learned to make bigger and better habitats, and Cradle had been abandoned for many centuries, an occasional destination for historians or curiosity seekers.The construction of the Eye had, in effect, cut Cradle and its immediate surroundings loose from Cleft, and it had drifted in a boneyard for a while until the decision had been made to give it a new purpose.The original greenhouse, which was a wreck by that point, had been replaced by a new, bigger, retractable cover.The underside had been planed flat.The canyon walls had been terraced back, making them less steep, and not incidentally creating valuable, buildable real estate.A nickel iron yoke had been arched over the whole thing so that it could be attached to the bottom end of the thirty six thousand kilometer tether that dangled from the Eye.The icon in the transit stationtwo hills enclosed in a bubblewas a simplified depiction of what Cradle actually looked like.Its total inhabitable footprint was a circular zone about two thousand meters in diameter, which put it on about the same scale as downtown Boston or the City of London.This was cleaved by the Vale of the Eves, whose walls had once been nearly vertical.Now this was true only of the bottom most ten meters or so: a slot that snaked through the bottom of the town like a gully.It became a rust brown river when there was heavy rain, and so they had maintained an island in the middle of the stream, exactly on the site where Endurance had touched down.Once, it had been possible to go there and touch the little nubs of steel where Eve Dinah had welded the ship into place.These, however, had since been protected under glass domes so that they would not rust, or get worn away by tourists fingers.The ship itself was long gone, of course; the survivors had begun dismantling it almost as soon as they had arrived, and what little they hadnt used was radioactive waste, long since shipped away to carefully tended locations in boneyards.It was therefore a city constructed on two dizzyingly steep hills that faced each other across a crevasse.A kilometer long bridge, celebrated for its grace, arched across the gulf between the hills, a plunging wedge of air flocculent with grizzled crows.It was a city of compounds.Some of these dated back to the early days of its construction, when the bubble had not yet been completed and there had been a need to make smaller inflatable domes over certain areas.Others had been built in imitation of those first ones.Neither the compoundswhich, for structural reasons, tended to be circularnor the overall topography lent themselves to a grid street pattern.Consequently the map was a chaos of switchbacks and meanders and streets that turned suddenly into stairways or tunnels.Limitations on building height led people to dig down into the underlying metal, rather than building upward, and so most of the citys square footage was hidden.The buildings were like icebergs, larger below than above.Above grade, stone was a popular building material.Older and less prestigious buildings used the synthetic rock known as moonstone, made from pieces of Earths former satellite.Newer and nicer buildings were made from marble, granite, or other rock quarried from the surface of the Earth itself.For the one resource that the shattered surface of Earth had been able to produce in abundance, even before it had an atmosphere, had been rocks.The city thus presented a hard face to pedestrians in its narrow streets.Those granted access to compounds would, however, find themselves in fragrant gardens under the shade of trees.Since Cradle was confined to the equator, green things grew there so luxuriantly that they had to be kept in check by hordes of little grabbs with pruning bill hands.Atop each of the hills was a park.Rising above one of those parks was a roundish, domed building called the Capitol.Rising above the other was a squarish, pillared colonnade called the Change, short for Exchange.At the time Kath Two and the other passengers arrived, Cradle was dangling two thousand meters above the waters of the Atlantic Ocean, being dragged due west toward where the equator cut across the reshaped coastline of South America.This movement reflected the fact that, thirty six thousand kilometers above it, the Eye was traversing the habitat ring westward, or CASFON (Clockwise As Seen From Over the North pole).Being nothing more than a weight on the end of a long string, Cradle always followed the movements of the Eye.The citys dome was open, with its baffles raised to reduce the windblast.It was balmy and humid.This was almost always true on the equator, but altitude and the brisk movement of the air made it pleasant enough.The smell of that air, redolent of salt and iodine and marine life, was proof irrefutable that Kath Two was back in the atmosphere of New Earth.It was an artificial atmosphere.The human races had bombarded the parched and dead surface of the planet with comet cores for hundreds of years just to bring the sea level up to where they wanted it.Then they had infected that water with organisms genetically engineered to produce the balance of gases needed to support lifeand, having done that, to commit suicide, so that their biomass could be used as nutrients for the next wave of atmosphere building creatures.According to their measurements, the result was a nearly perfect reproduction of Old Earths atmosphere.No one who breathed it after a lifetime spent in habitats needed scientific data to back that up.Its smell penetrated to some ancient part of the brain, triggering instincts that must go all the way back to hominid ancestors living on the shores of Africa millions of years ago.As she knew from having traveled to Earth many times, it was a kind of intoxicant.It was the best drug in the universe.It made people want to be on Earth more than anything.It was the reason that Cradlewhich was bathed in that air, being dragged through it all the time on the end of its thirty six thousand kilometer stringwas the most exclusive community in existence.And it was the reason that Red and Blue had twice gone to war over the right to live on the surface.Cradle was hung from the end of the tether by a sort of bucket handle that arched high above the middle of the city.The bucket handle was hollow, accommodating a surprisingly ramshackle elevator system that took Kath Two and some other passengers down to a platform embedded in the citys bedrock, or bedmetal, along its northern limb.From there a ramp took them up into the streets of the city itself.The tops of the walls all around the exit were white with crow shit.Hundreds of birds were perched where they could view the faces of those emerging into the light and swoop down to deliver messages to ones they had recognized.Other new arrivals stretched their hands out to offer little snacks.A well dressed Ivyn man, bustling along ahead of Kath Two, quickly attracted a grizzled crow by that strategy.With his other hand he held out a little tablet that, as Kath Two knew, must be showing someones photograph.Coffee at the Change, dot seventeen, the man said.The crow gulped the snack down in a move that looked almost like vomiting in reverse, then flapped away screaming the same words into the ether.Other grizzled crows, not hungry or not currently on errands, were keeping up a raucous murmur that, if you listened to it, might give you clues as to what was going on in the equities market or the political world.At first the new arrivals moved together in a pack, visibly distinct from the ordinary foot traffic of the place, but within a few hundred meters this had dispersed, and Kath Two found herself alone, no different from anyone else.She knew the general layout from schoolbooks.She had arrived on the north sideChange Hill.Perhaps a native would have known as much just from the attire of the people, the way they walked.These were comersants, working by day in subterranean offices, ascending to the surface for meals, recreation, and other means of enjoying their wealth.Commerce was, of course, spread all about the habitat ring, and the old centers of Greenwich, Rio, Baghdad, et al.had financial hubs that rivaled, and in some ways eclipsed, Change Hill.But nothing could ever compete with this place for prestige.The wealthiest and most powerful financiers, the up and coming traders in places like Greenwich, no matter how well they were doing for themselves, were forever haunted by the thought that they might be missing something on Cradle.Because so much of that activity was taking place below the surface, the streetscape of Change Hill was deceptively quiet, a little like an old Spanish city during siesta.Soon lost, and resigned to the fact that doing so would make her look like a tourist, Kath Two took the piece of paper out of her pocket and reminded herself of the address.She already knew it was on the south side and that she would either have to cross the bridgewhich was clearly visible, arcing high above the cityor descend all the way to the floor of the vale and cross the gully at its bottom.The latter tempted her, but she knew that she would want to spend a lot of time there, looking at the place where Endurance had touched down and where Eve Dinah had walked with Dubois Harris.That was best saved for later.So she climbed, winding her way through the streets, which were paved with a stone whose reddish brown color hid the rust stains that streaked down from every exposed bit of bedmetal.She cut across the park beside the Change, where young traders in good clothes, out on snack breaks, were sitting on benches prodding their tablets, or sprawled in clusters on the grass laughing, or playing lawn sports with colored balls.The bridges northern end met the parks edge.From far below, the bridge had looked slender and graceful, belying what she now understood was its real bulk.Here it broadened to form a massive connection with Change Hill.Even at its apogee, however, it was broad enough for twenty people to walk abreast.After turning around one last time to admire the marble columns of the Change and to hear the roar of voices within, she faced south and began to ascend.In the early going the bridge was a stairway, but as the arch gradually flattened with height, it turned into a ramp, faced in white marble, broken with occasional landings.She had been informed that the real reason for these was to prevent wheeled objects from going fully out of control.If so that purpose had been artfully concealed by turning them into little sculpture gardens where bridge climbers could pause for refreshment beneath rose covered bowers.While not immune to such temptations, Kath Two was at bottom a serious walker who did not like to stop once she had gotten going.She was thinking, reviewing in her mind the journey on the elevator, which had been largely uneventful.This, as she had gradually realized, was a part of its charm and of its exclusivity.It was possible to reach Cradle quickly, if you had enough money to charter, or authority to commandeer, the right vehicles.Most people used the elevator, though.Thus Cradle was separated from the rest of the human world not so much by distance as by time.Spending that much time was a sort of luxury, afforded only to a few.Of course, passengers worked en routethis explained all of those expensive restaurants and bars around the atrium, with their private meeting rooms.But Kath Two hadnt had any real work to do.She had gone for long hours without talking to another human at all, and had done a lot of reading and watching of entertainment on screens.She had slept normally, confirming that any epigenetic shift that might have gotten started last week had been aborted.All of this just made her want to reach the meeting place so that she could at least have an explanation from Doc, meet the missing Dinan and Adan, and get started on whatever it was the Seven was supposed to be doing.She maintained a brisk pace to the top of the arch but there permitted herself a few minutes pause.At the apex, the walkway broadened into a scenic overlook affectionately known as Hurricane Heights.The wind was so powerful here that it made her eyes water.She turned her back to it and toddled carefully over to the eastern railing, on the lee side.She blinked her vision clear and allowed herself a few minutes gawking down into the compounds and the streets and the Vale.The sun was setting behind her.Since they were on the equator it would set quickly.The Vale was already in shadow, but the stone walls of the compounds and the fronts of the buildings were emanating a magical pink gold glow.Lights were coming on in windows along purple shaded streets.It was a real place.Not like the artificial environments of the habitat ring.Some of the larger habitats came close to possessing this qualitythe sense that you were in something close to a real planetary environment.But it was always dispelled as soon as you looked up and saw the opposite side of the habitat hanging a few kilometers above your head.Here, you could look up and see endless sky, the stars coming out, the gleaming necklace of the habitat ring rising perpendicularly from the eastern horizon.The thing that made it real was the air, the sheer quantity of it, the endless variety of its movements and its smells.She wished she had a glider so that she could go dancing in it.ACCORDING TO A LEGEND THAT WAS ALMOST CERTAINLY INCORRECT, the overlook where Kath Two was standingthe center of the bridgewas the location where Eve Dinahs demolition charge had exploded after she had made her choice and tossed it into space.The compromise that Dinah had forced by placing that bomb against the window of the Banana had seemed elegant and straightforward for about as long as it had taken for the bomb to go off.In one sense, the gaming of the system had begun even before it was thought of, when Eve Julia had pointed out that she would have few babies and Eve Ada had prophesied that she would have many.It had not taken long for the other Eves to make similar calculations.As Arkies, picked in the Casting of Lots, Camila and Ada were younger than the others, with two to three decades of fertility ahead of them.If they decided to become baby factories, and if they were lucky, each of them could conceivably bear as many as twenty children before menopause.Dinah, Ivy, Moira, and Tekla, all in their early thirties, might bear a few each.Roughly speaking, therefore, those four had as much combined childbearing power, if you wanted to think about it that way, as the younger pair of Camila and Ada.Julia, as she had pointed out, would be lucky to bear one child before menopause.And she had not needed Doob to explain the exponential math.The Julians were going to be swamped.They were going to be mere curiosities.People in the distant future, coming home from work, would exclaim to their partners, Youll never guess what I saw todayan honest to god Julian!Those were the mathematical rudiments of the new Great Game, and the roots of much of what had happened since then.The preponderance of later historical scholarship suggested that most of the Eves didnt know that they were playing a game until they were a few years into it.Ada, based on what she had said in her Curse, might have been the exception to that rule.But decisions made about ones children were the most personal decisions that one could make, and no mother of sound mind would have admitted to herself, at the time, that she was playing a sort of game vis  vis the other mothers.In a way it would have been simpler had they gone about it more cold bloodedly.Consciously or not, the Seven Eves sorted themselves into Four, Two, and One.The Four were Dinah, Ivy, Tekla, and Moira.The Two were Camila and Ada.Arithmetic suggested that the descendants of the Four would be about as numerous as those of the Two.Existing friendships and affinities already linked the Four and created an unspoken compact, not articulated until they were long dead, to the effect that their children would embody complementary qualities.Dinans, in a sense, did not have to be complete humans as long as Ivyns were around to do some of the things they werent as good at.This was a blunt way of saying it, which was why it went unsaid for a long time, but hundreds of years later the descendants of the Four could look back and see that it had always been so.By that time it was so deeply ingrained in their DNA and their cultures that there was no going back.The Two, by contrast, had no natural affinity with each other, and no existing relationship.Camila and Ada had not met until shortly before the Council of the Seven Eves.All that they sharedand it wasnt much to go onwas an aversion to Julia.Both of them had, at one point or another, fallen under Julias spell only to be disappointed by her.In Camilas case the seduction had happened during a White House dinner.For her part, Ada had been talked by Julia into joining the Swarm, only to end up leading the rebel faction that had deposed and mutilated her.Given the way that had all turned out, it was of course unlikely that Camila, or anyone of sound mind, would consciously align herself with Ada.And yet the mathematics of the Four and the Two created a kind of gravity, invisibly drawing her that way.The breach that had opened between Camila and Dinah during the Council of the Seven Eves would not be forgotten.Considered more calmly, Camilas words had a persuasive power that couldnt be denied.It simply was the case that their descendants would be living bottled up in confined spaces for many generations to come.As Luisa had demonstrated through her research, and as the people of the Cloud Ark had just finished proving in spectacular fashion, it wasnt a good way for normal, unaltered humans to live.If the survival of the human race depended on rewiring their brains to make them better at such a lifestyle, then perhaps they had best get on with it.In a way, that decision had been taken out of their hands by Camila, who had made her choice clear, and only needed to work out the details with Moira.She had, in effect, made the first clear move in the great genetic game.And contrary to her own stated principles it was, in a way, the most aggressive move possible: she had let them know that her descendantswho were likely to be quite numerouswould get along just fine in the conditions they would all be facing for the first ten, twenty, or hundred generations.The other six were left to follow her lead or to react against it.Dinah, Ivy, and Tekla in essence reacted against it, with Moira eventually making another choice; but the historical fact was that Moiras descendants had, more often than not, been part of the bloc of the Four.Ada had played the game more overtly.This had basically consisted of waiting the others out to see what they would do, and then making countermoves.The other Eves decided early, and stuck with those decisions.All of Dinahs childrenshe ended up having five of themwere recognizably of a type.The same was true of Ivys three, and Teklas six.Julia only got to choose once.Camilas sixteen offspring varied from one to the next, as she tinkered with her decisions based on behaviors she was observing among her first children.But she had never wavered from the general template that she had laid out during the Council of the Seven Eves.Adas seven children, however, were all different.Exactly what she was thinking was known only to Moira, the Keeper of Secrets, the Mother of Races.For the other Eves told Moira what they wanted in confidence, and she took those confidences to her grave.But it was plain enoughand in any event, it became the accepted version of historythat the first five children of Ada had been conceived as reactions to what other Evesall except Moirawere doing.Adas stance toward the others had been well articulated in the Curse.She knew that the other six Eves would always loathe her personally and that this feeling would inevitably be transferred to her offspring.Human nature being what it was, Dinan children, thousands of years from now, would be throwing rocks at Adan children on playgrounds and making jokes about cannibalism.They would never be assimilated into the society descended from the Four.Therefore, to the extent that Dinah was making choices about the virtues that her offspring would embody, and thereby making a move in the game, Ada sought a countermove.Which might consist of conceiving a child that would be like Dinahs, except more so.Or of inventing an anti Dinan, a type of human uniquely suited to exploiting the weaknesses in the Dinan type.Thus the first five children of Ada.She had, however, been unable to employ the same strategy vis  vis Moira, for the basic reason that Moira knew exactly what Ada was doing, down to the specific DNA base pairs that had been altered in her ova.If this were a game, then Eve Moira always had the last move.The failures of her first eight pregnancies had only deepened the mystery.Since she had never articulated her choice, no one really knew what she had done, which made Moirans an enigmatic race, not only to the other races, but to themselves.But it was plainly the case that Moirans were the only race capable of going epi.Kath Twos genome, like that of every other life form, was fixed.A copy of it lived in every cell in her body.But which of those genes were being expressed at a given time, and which were lying dormant, was changeable to a degree far beyond what humans were normally capable of.It would have amounted to a kind of superpower, had there been a way to control it.But, certain hoary old legends to the contrary, there wasnt.Kath Two never knew when she might fall asleep for a week and wake up a different person named Kath Three.Sometimes the results were brilliant.Rarely they were fatal.Sometimes they were inconvenient, or downright embarrassing.Most of the latter cases had something to do with what happened, like it or not, when a Moiran fell in love.In any case, this was the choice that Eve Moira had made and the gift she had conferred on her daughter, Cantabrigia.And it was assumed that she had done so because she believed that this degree of plasticity would somehow bring the world back into balance against the choices that Ada had been making.Julia, the One, looked to make the best of a bad situation by endowing her offspring with qualities that would make them useful and important in spite of much smaller numbers.She had already expressed, during the Council of the Seven Eves, the idea that there was real value in the ability to envision possible futures.And she had linked it to leadership, or, failing that, to the ability to give useful advice to leaders.When that trait ran out of control and sought dark paths it led to depression, paranoia, and other forms of mental illness.The challenge then was to find a way of combining that trait with a more positive mentality.Julias researchand she did a lot of researchtherefore tended to center on the history of sages, seers, ecstatics, shamans, artists, depressives, and paranoiacs throughout history, and the extent to which those traits could be localized to specific base pairs in their genomes and fostered by acculturation.Historians had come along much later and developed their own vocabulary for telling the story of the succeeding five thousand years.The first pregnancies were called Gestations.Not counting the numerous miscarriages, there had been thirty nine of them, distributed among the Seven Eves, before Camila, the last to stop bearing children, had finally gone through menopause.From these, thirty five viable girls had resulted.Thirty two had gone on to have children of their own.By then, Eve Moira had figured out how to synthesize Y chromosomes, and so some of the second generation had been male.The result, therefore, had been thirty two Strains.Each of the seven new races had embodied more than one Strain.The Strains were recognizably different and yet clearly classifiable as belonging to one race or another, somewhat as East Africans differed from West Africans but still looked like Africans to Europeans.Correction was the name given to the phase that had begun after the first round of Gestations, when Eve Moira had fixed errors that had led to several nonviable infants.In a sense, Correction went on continuously all through the first round of Gestations and began to taper off as the daughters of the Eves began to produce second generation children.It faded into a next stage, Stabilization, which lasted through the following ten generations or so as Y chromosomes were patched up, lingering genetic mistakes were fixed, and members of different Strains began to interbreed to produce hybrids within their own racial groups.During this time the lessons of the black footed ferret were put to use as various techniques were employed to increase heterozygosity.In truth a vast library of human genetic sequences was available in digital form, and once they had survived the first few generations in Cradle, and trained hundreds of bright young people to be genetic engineers, they could, in theory, have resequenced the original human race from scratch.This was the sort of thing Eve Moira had done by synthesizing the first artificial Y chromosome.But it was not what they collectively chose to do.That choice was altogether cultural, not scientific.Decisions had been made in the Council of the Seven Eves.Races had been founded that were, by then, several generations old.They had begun to develop their own distinctive cultures.To undo those decisions by reverting to the rootstock human race was viewed almost as a kind of auto genocide.The competition that had developed among the different races rendered it unthinkable.So the genetic records of rootstock humanity were put to work adding a healthy degree of heterozygosity back into the existing races, rather than trying to go backward.Thus Stabilization, which had continued until about the twelfth generation, by which point even the Julian race had grown large enough to go on propagating through normal means without the need for lab based adjustments.Stabilization had blended into Propagation, the next phase generally recognized by historians, which was fairly self explanatory: the descendants of the Seven Eves had continued to have sex with each other and make more babies.This had occupied much of the first half of the First Millennium and led to a condition of overcrowding so severe that it had made obligatory the formation of separate colonies away from Cradle.For there were other places, perhaps not quite so favored as Cleft, but still well suited for the building of new habitats.They had reached the point, by then, of being able to construct new machines for moving about in space.It was time.Or so insisted the descendants of the Four, who sensed that conditions had become inimical to them in the crowded precincts of Cradle.Camila had been frank about her strategy of making new humans well suited to life in confined spaces.She had succeeded in doing so.And once the early habitats of Cradle had grown crowded, her strategy had begun to look like a good one.Whether it was purely an expression of their own racial mythologies or a biological necessity, the Four had reached out and pioneered new habitats, at first in other locations on Cleft, later on other fragments of Peach Pit.The descendants of Ada had done likewise, sometimes cohabiting with the Four, more often going it alone.It wasnt so much that Ada had done things that couldnt be undone as that she had said things that couldnt be unsaid.In that sense her Curse had real effect.An individual Adan of the Second Millennium was the product of a mixed race culture that was more than a thousand years old.He or she had grown up with persons of all races, loving some and hating others, getting on well, perhaps, with certain Teklans and Moirans while getting into fights with certain Adans.In terms of his or her own personal experiences, there was no reason to stick together with others of the same race.But each race did have an ineradicable narrative, by now encoded into a culture that had become ancient.The narrative of the Adans was that their Eve had spawned not just one race but a race of races, a mosaic, as proof that her children could do all that those of the other Eves could, and more.And if you were a descendant of Ada, clearly endowed with genetic markers that she had chosen for that purpose, then the inexorable force of that narrative would drive you toward colonies populated largely or purely by other Adans.As the Adans were less numerous than the descendants of the Four, their Second Millennium colonies had tended to be smaller and more Spartan, leading to a symbiotic relationship with the Camites, who tended to thrive in such environments.Adans built colonies but Camites made them work.In any case, the formation of new colonies and habitats during the Second Millennium had led to a phase that the historians called Isolation: the formation of racially pure populations.Isolation led to Caricaturization: selective breeding, pursued consciously in some cases and unconsciously in others, that had the effect over many generations of intensifying racial differences.The example cited most often was a gradual change in eye color among Moirans.Eve Moiras eyes had been hazel: relatively light in color by the standards of black people, but not all that unusual.By the end of the Second Millennium, many Moirans had eyes so pale in color as to appear golden in strong light.On the walls of the Great Chains fashion stores, blown up to ten times life size, Moiran fashion models still gazed at you through shockingly yellow, catlike eyes.Because pale eyes had been a distinctive characteristic of Eve Moira, it had become thought of as beautiful and desirable, and Moirans with pale eyes had found it easier to mate and reproduce, intensifying the trait over time, to the point of caricature.Kath Two herself, no model, was frequently complimented on the lightness of her eyes, which were closer to green than yellow.But modern, appearance conscious Moirans were frequently startled when they saw photographs of their Eve with her eyes that were merely greenish brown.The shift in Moiran eye color was obvious and easily documented, but the same thing, mutatis mutandis, had happened with scores of other phenotypes among all the races.Selective mating had the power to wreak impressive changes over time, without any artificial meddling.In some cases, though, racial isolates had acquired genetic labs of their own.These had been used for many purposes, usually considered benign.In some cases, they had been used for Enhancement, which meant deliberate genetic manipulation for the purpose of rendering racial characteristics more pronouncedthe artificial acceleration of what was happening naturally in the way of Caricaturization.Sometimes this led to freaks, monsters, and disasters.But often it worked.And when its results mated within isolated groups, those isolates became more and more pronounced embodiments of their races.The end result of all this tended to be nonviable populations clearly identifiable as inbred.So, as often as Isolation, Caricaturization, and Enhancement had taken root and run their courses, they had led either to extinction of colonies or to an ameliorative process called Cosmopolitanization, wherein formerly isolated groups had remerged with their long lost cousins of the same race and bred back in the direction of healthy and sustainable hybridized strains.Not surprisingly, Cosmopolitanization had flourished as the habitat ring had been formed during the most recent millennium, suddenly creating a vast amount of new living space far more appealing than the cramped, dark tori in which people had been living for the last four thousand years.The isolates, some of whom hadnt been heard from for centuries, some of whom could not even speak Anglisky (as the Russian inflected English, now shared by essentially all humans, was called), emerged from their holes and recombined with their extended families in a population explosion the likes of which had not been seen since Old Earths twentieth century.Most of the population of most of the races had thus converged on a set of renormalized racial profiles, while preserving a few extreme tribal isolate strains, variously treasured, feared, or persecuted by others of the same race.Or at least that was how it was in Blue.Red had exhibited the same general trends among its Adan mosaic, its hundreds of millions of Camites, and the roughly 80 percent of Julians who had decided to throw in their lot with Red.The current state of affairs between the turnpikes could only be speculated at, since no communication, other than stray signals intelligence and a propaganda channel that most people ignored, had been received from that part of the habitat ring for almost two hundred years.FOR A FEW MINUTES THE LAST LIGHT OF THE SUN HAD BEEN STRIKING spires, statues, and carved stonework on the fronts of some fantastic old kupols mounted to the seemingly vertical cliff before her: the flank of Capitol Hill.But then suddenly it was near dark.Kath Two turned, accepting the windblast on her right side, and descended the south limb of the bridge.As much as she loved the power of the air, she felt herself scurrying the last few steps to get down into the shelter of the buildings.Capitol Hill was higher than Change Hill and so, rather than debouching into a park, as it did on its north end, the bridge here stabbed into the flank of the slope.Kath Two was plunged directly into a snarl of streets that were but indifferently illuminated by light spilling from occasional doorways and lamps that the owners of some compounds had decided to mount along the tops of their walls.The streetscape of Bordeaux draped over the topography of Rio de Janeiro was how the city had been described by its designer, a Julian/Moiran breed who had been born more than four thousand years after both of those cities had been annihilated.She had a device in her pocket that knew her exact latlong.Those numbers were, of course, useless in a city that was being dragged through the air on the end of a rope.Her reluctance to pull the thing out and look at it, however, went deeper than that.Being here had plunged her into a sort of reverie none the less compelling for being obviously the product of fantasy: namely, that she was walking around in a city on Old Earth.She didnt want to spoil it until she was well and truly lost.So she let her feet take her through the red stone streets, trying to go uphill as much as she went downhill, using the towers of great old kupols as landmarks, when unsure of herself circling back toward the abutment of the bridge.For she had been told that the meeting place was not far from the bridge.She might have asked for directions, but the temperature had dropped, the glittering arc of the habitat ring had been obscured by high clouds, and it had begun to rain, a hissing curtain of small, warm drops.Pedestrians had all disappeared into wherever it was they knew to go.Shed been warned that Capitol Hill was deserted after dark; this seemed doubly true when a storm was brewing.Several times she had passed by the front of the same building, or seen it from down the length of a street.For it stood at a place where several ways angled together into a cramped asterisk of wet cobblestones, and so sudden views of it kept jumping into her peripheral vision as she ambled along the nearby alleys.That intersection was there because of a house sized block of stone that jutted from the hillside and forced all the nearby streets to stretch around it.The stone, as she could guess, was a crumb of the moons mantle that had become embedded in its iron core.It might have been in there for a billion years, or it might have been a loose bolide that had slammed into red hot Peach Pit shortly after Zero and gotten stuck in the congealing metal.Cleft and its siblings had many of those.They were usually treated as impurities in the melt.This one had been left in situ, presenting a rugged gray face to the streets that wrapped around it.Atop it, ten meters above street level, someone had constructed a round stone tower.Fanning out behind, like a ships hull behind its jutting prow, was a triangular building that she could guess had a nice compound in its center.The third or fourth time Kath Two saw this tower it was from a distance of perhaps a hundred meters.She was gazing at it straight down one of those narrow streets.On its upper story it had a row of arched windows, looking out in all directions.Warm light was shining out of those windows, and she could see people sitting at tables, drinking and talking and eating and reading.All of those activities sounded good to her, and she entertained a hope that it might be some kind of public housenot a private club.The entrance was not obvious, but she found it around to the right side, where a mousehole had been cut into the metal matrix in which the rock was embedded.The tunnel angled upward and curled around, becoming a spiral stair partly obstructed by rusticles the size of small trees.Actual candles burned in niches.One turn of the helix took her out of the metal and into the stone; two took her to an arch topped door of real wood, unmarked except for a wrought metal door knocker in the shape of a bird with a heavy curved beak.Hand forged feathers of black iron and palladium made it grizzled.Through the door she could feel warmth and hear conversation.She reached for the knocker, unsure yet whether the place was meant to be public or private.Then suddenly she was conscious of the scrap of paper in her hand.She stretched it out under the light of the nearest candle.THE CROWS NEST SOUTH CRADLE She pushed the door open and entered.The first thing that came into her view was a semicircular bar of old copper, a row of tap handles, a window behind looking into a busy kitchen.Music came out of a back room, not so loud as to interfere with conversation, but enough to make her nod her head slightly with its beat.She didnt recognize the style, but she knew the type: something that had been cooked up by people isolated in a mining colony or an early habitat, people who knew how to dance.Tending bar was a healthy looking Dinan man in his forties.He seemed not to know that he was quite handsome.He was polishing a glass while scanning a piece of paper with handwritten numbers on ita bar tab.Standing there alone, facing outward at the sweep of windows with its astonishing view of Cradle, he looked like the captain of an Old Earth ship.A few moments after she had enteredneither so soon as to make her feel conspicuous nor so late as to make her feel neglectedhe looked up at her and raised his eyebrows slightly.Or perhaps eyebrow was better since, as she now saw, one side of his face had taken serious damage.What are you drinking, Kath Amalthova Two?THE ORIGINAL NATS HAD BEEN DEVELOPED IN THE WORKSHOPS OF Arjuna Expeditions in Seattle and launched into space shortly before Zero, where they had crawled around on the surface of Amalthea under the eye of Eve Dinah.Later, during the first two years of the Epic, the original design had been modified to work on, and in, ice.Every child knew the story of how such nats had been used, first to bring Ymir to rendezvous with Izzy, then to merge those two objects into Endurance.As such, nats resonated more strongly in Blue culture than in Red, but they were used on both sides of the turnpikes.Or to be more precise, both cultures used a vast family tree of species and subspecies of nat, all descended from the first Arjuna model and all sharing, to a greater or lesser degree, the code base originally created by programmers like Larz Hoedemaeker and Eve Dinah.The number of different uses to which nats, and swarms thereof, had been put over the millennia was uncountable.They were as ubiquitous and as various as hammers and knives had been pre Zero.Like hammers and knives, they could be used for constructive or destructive purposes.In the latter category was a whole taxonomy of nats designed to be projected at high speed out of gunlike devices.Most of these were designed to fold up into a compact form, like a dart or bullet, so that they could be accommodated in magazines, bandoliers, and the like, and fed into the breeches of firing mechanisms.Only a single gun, in the sense of a traditional pre Zero firearm, had survived the Hard Rain and found its way to Cleft.This was, of course, the revolver that Julia had removed from Pete Starlings shoulder holster and secreted on her person until the moment when she had attempted to shoot Tekla with it.Camila had interceded, probably saving Teklas life, and suffered burns that had left her scarred and in pain for the remainder of her days.Later, the same weapon had fallen into the hands of Ada.She had issued it to a member of her band who had fired the Last Bullet from the Last Gun to kill Steve Lake.The weapon was now in the collection of the historical museum on the Great Chain.Whether and how it was put on public display was a reliable barometer of the state of Red Blue relations.Since the metalworking technology needed to make new guns had also been destroyed, and since many generations had passed on Cleft before anyone had even conceived a need for gunlike objects, the entire armaments industry, when it had finally gotten rebooted, had done so from a clean slate.The results owed more to Tasers, several of which had made their way to Cleft, than to traditional firearms.The latter had been designed to project a dumb lump of metal at high speed and been optimized over time to deliver high rates of fire.But spraying dumb lumps of metal around the cramped interior of a space habitat was not a good fit for any use that could be conceived of by the engineers who, hundreds of years after the arrival on Cleft, began to think once again about how to make projectile weapons.During the intervening centuries, violence had generally been a matter of grappling, punching, and the use of hand weapons such as metal rods, with really dangerous stuff like knives and swords used only in a few cases by people who had gone well off the political or psychological rails.The first new projectile weapons were made specifically for use against those.The maximum range was perhaps ten meters, so the projectiles didnt have to travel with high velocity.They had to be smart in the sense that if they missed the targetif they struck anything that was not a human beingthey should become as nondestructive as possible.This generally meant that they would deploy what amounted to tiny drag chutes and slow themselves down as quickly as possible, while preparing to fragment against, as opposed to penetrating, whatever they hit.On the other hand, any projectile fortunate enough to reach its target should try to do something useful, which generally meant incapacitating, injuring, or killing it.Clearly, all of these decisions were well above the pay grade of dumb lumps of metal and so nats were used instead.These were not as dense as lead, so they had a low ballistic coefficient and could not travel very far.Again, however, in the context of a space habitat this was a good thing.After a sort of dark age during which the Cleft colony had lacked the resources needed to advance the art of robotics, and contented themselves with fixing, and making copies of, the original models, new engineering resources had begun going into this branch of technology.The bolder programmers were daring to meddle with code files that had last been checked in by Eve Dinah.Mechanical engineers were figuring out how to reboot ancient CAD software and examine the digital blueprints created by Larz.Their initial efforts were fairly simple, such as making a nat that would automatically throw out a drag chute after it had traveled a certain distance without hitting anything.More effort went into the projectors than the projectiles.Police and military users tended to be Teklans, whose Anglisky contained more Russian loan words than that of other races, and borrowed many characters from the Cyrillic alphabet.Katapult was their preferred term for the device that threw the projectile nats.They shortened it to various affectionate terms such as kat and katya.The second half of the word, pult, seemed to have a connection to pulya, pronounced with a long U as in pool, which was the Russian word for bullet.After a brief, awkward phase of trying to combine the term nat with pulya in various ways, meaning something like bullet robot, they had just settled for pulya, which was sufficiently precise in a universe that no longer included any actual old school bullets.Other words from the antediluvian gun world made it through unchanged, such as shoot and shot, but officers giving the command to shoot tended now to say pul, recalling what skeet and trap shooters had once called out when they wanted a clay pigeon to be thrown.Use of the term pulya without any modification tended to irritate knowledgeable interlocutors in exactly the same way as pre Zero gun nuts had reacted to laypersons who used the word bullet.This reflected the fact that pulyas came in an even vaster range of sizes and types than old school ammo.There were only so many things that could be done with a lump of lead.A far wider range of options lay open to the pulya engineer.An alternative term, ambot, was also used.This was all context dependent.Grunts, who tended to see these things as necessary burdens to be hauled around in bulk, loaded into kats, unjammed from firing mechanisms, etc., tended to use pulya, but once the projectile had actually been fired and begun to execute its program, it tended to be called an ambot.When speaking of bulk supplies, people would say botmo in the same way that ammo had been used on Old Earth.The sort of person who needed to be shot at by the authorities because he or she was committing violence, or threatening to, with edged weapons, was unlikely to submit meekly to advances in the technologies used to enforce civil order.Directly they began to develop countermeasures, which, of course, then needed to be surmounted by the engineers in turn.If an ambot, for example, could be fooled into believing that it had missed its target or struck something that was not a human, it could be rendered nearly harmless.Camouflage changed its purpose from fooling the human eye to fooling the electronic brains of ambots.Armor was no longer made to stop extremely fast pieces of lead.Its purpose now was to protect the wearer from the invasive strivings of ambots.Warriors became living, moving fortresses under siege of multiple ambots that often used swarm tactics to find a way inside before their batteries ran down.The old tactical calculus of projectile warfare changed in other ways too.Katapults and botmo that had been captured by the enemy, or that had simply fallen to the floor and been picked up, could be rendered inert and useless by digital means.Some of them would try to find their way back to their masters, and so battle zones in which a lot of botmo had been expended tended to look as though they were infested by army ants as spent ambots attempted to swarm back toward the combatants who had fired them.In any event, the authorities had enjoyed a monopoly over the production and use of such weapons until sometime in the Second Millennium, when the number of widely separated habitats, and resulting political fragmentation, led to a situation in which the civil authorities from Habitat A might actually have cause to shoot at those of Habitat B.  The number of different types of katapults and ambots, and of the defensive measures used against them, exploded.No complete catalog of types had existed for thousands of years.Here and there one might stumble across a museum display in which a few dozen or even a few hundred types of ambots had been rendered inert and mounted to a wall with explanatory plaques beneath them explaining in what millennium they had been invented, by whom, and in which habitat they had been used to prosecute this or that disturbance.But everyone knew implicitly that such displays only included samples that had at random made their way into a particular collectors drawer.Disturbance was used a lot more often than war, even for relatively large events such as the conflicts that had occurred over the last few centuries between Red and Blue.Because space habitats were so vulnerable, prosecuting an actual war in the sense of a twentieth century, Old Earth total war was unthinkable.Nuclear weapons had not been reinvented because there was no need for them.A rock thrown across the ring at a space habitat would kill as many people as a hydrogen bomb.The same strategic calculus therefore applied as on Old Earth during and after the Cold War, namely that on no account would Red and Blue risk actual, open war with each other but that many small conflicts could happen in places where they might be passed off, by the majority of the news reading populace, as too minor to worry about.The only two conflicts that were denoted, in retrospect, as wars were ones that had taken place the old fashioned way, on the surface of the planet: the War on the Rocks, 48784895, and the War in the Woods, 49804985.When Kath Two walked into the Crows Nest and was greeted by the Dinan with the damaged face, it was 5003, so about twenty years after the high water mark of the War in the Woods.The Dinan looked to be about forty years old.The scars on his face had been there for a long time.One of those, she said, nodding at a nearby tap handle adorned with a handwritten label identifying it as cider.Coming right up, he said.Since I have you at a disadvantage, my names Ty Lake.Short for Tycho or ...Tyuratam.Bit of a mouthful.His accent was that of an Indigen.So, from this brief exchange she was able to surmise quite a bit about his history.His parents had probably been Sooners, which was to say, people who had been so eager to escape from the settled life of space habitats that they had found ways of getting down to the surface of New Earth just as soon as the TerReForm had rendered it marginally inhabitable.Doing so was a violation of First Treaty, which had ended the War on the Rocks a few decades earlier, and so it was discouraged.Comings and goings from the bigger and older habitats of the ring were easily monitored by the authorities, and so Sooners tended to depart from liminal zones on the edges of boneyards and near the two turnpikes.On the Blue side, Dinans were strongly overrepresented among Sooners.Teklans tended to be the coplike authorities given responsibility for chasing them down and breaking up their human smuggling rings, leading to stereotypical depictions in popular culture of Dinans as charismatic pirates and Teklans as humorless straight arrows.Or at least that had been the case until the Sooners transgressions had led to the War in the Woods, in which the predominantly Teklan armed forces had been obliged to rescue many Dinan adventurers.Depictions nowadays were a little more nuanced and made the older ones seem campy.Thus Kath Two could reasonably guess that Tys parents had been Sooners and had established themselves on the surface long enough to have at least one native born son.The connection back to boneyards meant that Sooners tended to be people with a certain amount of skill in making things, and so many of the early Sooner communities had been soundly constructed on an engineering level even if their political culture had been a little on the rough and ready side.Ty, presumably, had grown up in that environment and found himself, in his late teens or early twenties, embroiled in the War in the Woods.Some ambot of some typeno point in worrying about the detailshad found its way through his armor (assuming he was even wearing any) and done damage to his face.This was the sort of thing ambots tended to be good at.In combat it was frequently more useful to disable than to kill, and so ambots fought like chimpanzees, aiming for the face, the hands, and the genitals.Faces were easy to recognize and hard to spoof, so those were a favored target.Ty might have suffered these injuries in many different circumstances, e. g. , a Red on Blue raid between two rival Sooner communities, but there was something about his posture and his manners that suggested a connection to the military, and so she guessed he had been officially recruited to fight for the Blue side, and suffered his injury in a straight up battle between organized military formations.He obviously ran this place.This was clear from the way he was treated by staff and customers alike.In and of itself it wasnt unusual for a retired veteran to open a bar.That was so normal as to border on stereotype.It was a little less easy to explain how such a person could end up in control of this particular bit of real estate, which was probably worth more than some entire space habitats.The brand name on the tap handle, combined with the fact that it was handwritten, both implied that this beverage had been produced from apples plucked from trees growing in the soil of New Earth.Under the terms of Second Treaty, which had terminated the War in the Woods, the only people allowed to live on the surface and do things like tend orchards were the descendants of Sooners, now renamed Indigens.The fact of this ciders being on tap here proved, or else was a very well crafted marketing campaign intended to create the impression, that Ty Lake maintained close connections with at least one Indigen community and that he was importing its produce directly from its Registered Indigen Zone, or RIZ.This made it a desirable luxury good, since most food was produced, far more cheaply and reliably, in habitats.Drinking beverages or eating food produced in a RIZ was for wealthy connoisseurs.Perhaps to allay any concerns Kath Two might be having on that score, Ty said, On the house, as he set the glass on its coaster.That is kind of you, Kath Two said, as her eye strayed to the black slate above the bar and noticed a shocking figure quoted in the way of price.On the contrary, Ty said.Normal courtesy for a fellow member of my Seven.So, Tyuratam Lake was their Dinan.It made sense, if the Seven was going to be doing anything on the surface, anything that might involve a RIZ.Youre a bit early, Ty said.Some of the others are here.He tossed his head back.This looked like one of those bars that went on forever, rambling into annexes and back rooms in a way that no architect would countenance, unless they were a very sly architect indeed.So, she inferred he was making reference to some kind of back room or snuggery that she would never be able to find on her own.Came up the back way, he added.Theres a back way?Theres always a back way.Doc?Showed up half an hour ago.For the most important living architect of the TerReForm to walk into the front door of a crowded bar on Capitol Hill would be to create all manner of unnecessary distractions.Doc would be recognized.People would want to demonstrate how important they were by walking up to him and introducing, or reintroducing, themselves.It would become tiresome and it would wear him out.People would talk about it, perhaps even to the point of fouling up whatever mission the Seven was being organized for.Of course Doc had used the back way.Anyone else?she asked.Besides the nurse?Just the big fella.So Beled had arrived too.Or so she guessed until several minutes later, when Beled walked in through the same door that Kath Two had used.He looked around the place in a manner that made it obvious he had never been here before.Quickly he picked out Kath Twos face.He did not react, but moved toward her directly.Kath Two had taken the last available bar stool, but Beled cut through the crowd, which was easy for him since people tended to get out of his way, and stood behind her, close enough that she could feel his warmth on her back.He ordered a popular brand of inexpensive beer from another member of the staff: a breed, probably Camite/Julian, female, somewhat exotic.Ty had drifted away and resumed whatever hed been doing with the bar tab.Kath Two checked her timepiece and guessed that Ty was getting ready to clock out so that he could take them back to the room where they would have the meeting.As the woman behind the bar handed the beer from her tiny hand into Beleds huge mitt, Kath Two pivoted toward him, tinked her glass against his, and said, To the Seven.Beled was busy for a moment thanking the barmaid in somewhat over formal style, but then nodded and joined Kath Two in a drink.Kath Two explained what she knew of Tyuratam Lake and Beled spent the next several minutes appraising the Dinan from a distance, drawing who knew what conclusions.Presently Ty finished his paperwork and slipped around the corner of the bar, catching Kath Twos eye as he did so.She could see that for him to extract himself from the society of the Crows Nest was no insignificant thing, since many knew him and wanted to say hello.But he seemed to have learned a sort of posture and gait that made him look too busy to brook interruption.Kath Two found it hard to keep up with Tys meandering course through the various rooms and corridors, and ended up allowing Beled to step in front of her so that he could break trail.Because Beled was much taller and wider than she was, this made it difficult for her to see what was ahead of them.But at length she became conscious of being in a long down sloping corridor with a stone floor, and stone walls paneled over with wood to make them seem warmer.Various doors led off of it, but one stood at the end, and this Ty opened for them.She saw warm light spilling out, glancing off the polished rock between Beleds legs and the wood paneling around his shoulders.Welcome to the Bolt Hole, Ty said.Kath Two followed Beled into the room and then collided with his backside, bouncing off him and taking a step back.He had come to a dead stop upon entering and dropped into a slight crouch, one foot ahead of the other and pointed straight ahead.Sidling around him, Kath Two followed his gaze, and his toes azimuth, across the room.The Bolt Hole was a cozy little place with an oval table just big enough for seven.Doc was seated nearest the door, flanked by Memmie and by his robot.Across from him was Ariane Casablancova.Seated at the far end of the table, facing the door, was the man that Ty must have meant when he had spoken of the big fella.Because of his position behind the table, all that was visible were his head, shoulders, and arms.The arms seemed long and quite heavily constructed.What really drew attention, though, was the architecture of the big fellas skull.His head looked like the head that a normal persons head would develop into if they kept growing beyond adulthood into some more pronounced phase of development.Thick reddish brown eyebrows did little to conceal a prominent ridge of bone above the eyes.When Kath Two first saw him he was draining a pint glass, which looked even smaller in his hand than it had in Beleds; but when he set it down to expose the lower half of his clean shaven face, she saw the set of his jaw, and the size of his teeth, and understood that the seventh member of the Seven was not just any Adan but a Neoander.EVE ADA HAD FOUNDED SEVEN STRAINS OVER THE COURSE OF THIRTEEN separate pregnancies.The failure rate had been so high because the alterations she had demanded from Eve Moira had been so extreme.She had been willing to accept some unsuccessful pregnancies, given that she saw herself as having plenty of time until menopause compared to all the other Eves save Camila.And Camila she did not see as a competitor, given that Camila wanted to raise a race of people who were not inclined to compete with anyone.The Eves, confined to a small volume of inhabitable space on Cleft for the remainder of their lives, were impoverished in many ways.Of information, however, they had an inexhaustible wealth.Essentially every document that had ever been digitized was available to them, at least until such time as the memory chips on which it was all archived began to fail: a decay that had begun on a small scale but that would take decades to have any serious effect.Ada began to research human genetics.To the extent that her genome was the final expression of a long historical processa dense and cryptic encoding of everything that her ancestors had learned by managing to survive long enough to reproducethis meant learning about the history of human evolution as well.Her genome, like that of all the other Arkies, had been sequenced and evaluated before she had left Earth.A copy of the report had been provided to her.It contained information as to what parts of the world her ancestors had come from.Much of this was what you would expect for an Italian woman, but there were details she hadnt known, such as some genetic connections to Northern African Jews, to an isolated tribe in the Caucasus, and to the Nordic peoples.Based on certain genetic markers it was also clear that, like many Europeans, she was part Neanderthal.Later analysis, by historical scholars, of the bread crumb trails left by Ada in computer logs suggested that she had spent almost as much time studying the genomes of the Four, whom she saw as her direct competitors, as her own.And of the Four, she spent as much time learning about Moiras genome as Dinahs, Teklas, and Ivys combined.This was because Moira was of African descent, and Ada had become fascinated by the idea that Africans carried more genetic diversity within their genomes than non Africans, as a simple result of the fact that humanity had originated on that continent and spread outward.Non African races had been founded by isolated groups of adventurers.Breeding among themselves, they had created gene pools that were necessarily limited to what they had brought with them: only a subset of what was to be found in Africa.This idea had been used to explain, for example, why Africa contained both the tallest and the most diminutive people in the world, and why so many top athletes were African.It wasnt because they were naturally better athletes but because the bell shaped curve of random genetic variation was wider.For every African who was a great athlete there was presumably another who was miserably uncoordinated, but no one paid any notice to the latter.Whether or not this was a valid theory, the fact was that Ada swallowed it hook, line, and sinker and used it to inform her genetic strategy in the Great Game.And to the extent that the Four bothered to develop counterstrategies, they had to take it into account.The very existence of Moirans, as a race, was a result.Rather than try to follow all of Adas machinations in detail, base pair for base pair, Eve Moira had chosen to tinker with those aspects of the genome that controlled epigenetics, making her children into Swiss Army knives.Tekla had been an easier target, where Ada was concerned, since she had stated so forthrightly what she considered desirable in a future race.It was easy enough to see that the children of Tekla were going to be strong, disciplined, formidable fighters.And one did not have to be a military genius to understand that fighting, for the foreseeable futureseveral millennia of being bottled up in space colonieswas going to be up close and personal.To the extent that violence was going to be an ongoing factor in human history, it was going to be a style of violence that relied on size, strength, and toughness.If history was any guide, those best at violence might end up ruling over everyone else.Ada was not about to see her children dominated by the sons and daughters of Tekla.She might simply have done what Tekla did, and created versions of herself modified for certain traits associated with athleticism.Instead, having become fascinated by the odd detail in her genetic report, she had embarked on a program to reawaken the Neanderthal DNA that, or so she imagined, had been slumbering in her and her ancestors nuclei for tens of thousands of years.It was a somewhat insane idea, and in any case she didnt have enough Neanderthal in her to make it feasible, but she did produce a race of people with vaguely Neanderthal like features, and in later centuries the processes of Caricaturization, Isolation, and Enhancementwhich had affected all the races to some extenthad wrought especially pronounced changes on this subrace.Gene sequences taken from the toe of an actual Neanderthal skeleton, found on Old Earth and sequenced before Zero, were put to use.Old Earth paleontology journals had been data mined for stats on bone length and muscle attachment so that those could be hard coded into the Neoander wetware.The man sitting at the end of the table was the artificial product of breeding and of genetic engineering, but, had he been sent back in time to prehistoric Europe, he would have been indistinguishable, at least in his outward appearance, from genuine Neanderthals.The creation of the new race had happened incrementally, over centuries.By the time Neoanders existed it was too late to bother with the trifling ethical question of whether it was really a good thing to have created them.During their slow differentiation from the other races they had developed a history and a culture of their own, of which they were as proud as any other ethnic group.Not surprisingly, much of that history was about their relationship with Teklans, which was, as foreordained, largely combative.At its most simple minded and stupidly reductionist bones, the Teklan side of the story was that Neoanders were dangerous ape men brought into existence by a crazy Eve as a curse upon the other six races.The Neoander side had it that Teklans were what Hitler would have produced if hed had genetic engineering labs, and that it was a damned good thing that Eve Ada had had the foresight to produce a countervailing force of earthy, warm, but immensely strong and dangerous protectors.Much of this combative relationship had become irrelevant as the tactical landscape had become dominated by katapults and ambots, and physical strength had become less important to the outcome of fights.But the old primordial animus remained, and explained why Beleds immediate response, upon entering a room that contained a Neoander, was to make himself ready for hand to hand combat.Doc chose to ignore this.If he even notices, Kath Two thought, but she was pretty sure Doc noticed everything.Beled, Kath, I do not believe you have met Langobard.It was a fairly common Adan name.Bard for short, Langobard offered.Langobard, may I present Beled Tomov and Kath Amalthova Two.Bard rose to his full height, which was not all that impressive, while performing the Adan version of the salute, which was done with both hands.He then reached out across a seemingly impossible distance with his right, offering to shake.Beled was still reluctant to move, and so Kath Two stepped forward and extended her hand.She had never made physical contact before with a Neoander.Even in Red they had become somewhat scarce, as many of the existing population had moved down to New Earth to become Indigens.In Blue they were rarely seen at all.Langobard took her hand with elaborate delicacy, swallowing it up in a meat paw with fingers the size of baby arms, and giving it the gentlest of squeezes.He was clean shaven and carefully groomed, wearing a good suit of clothes that actually fitprompting her to wonder where such a person would find a tailor.He had a slightly bemused look on his face, as if he knew what she was thinking.Charmed, he said, with a little nod that only emphasized the size and mass of his head.And after she had nodded back, he released her hand, no worse for wear, and stretched it out toward Beled.Lieutenant Tomov?Pleasure to meet you.Whats it going to be?Punch in the face?Handshake?Or a big warm hug?He swung his hand back while extending the other arm, displaying a wingspan much greater than his height, as though offering to embrace Beled across the table.This, at least, broke the tension enough that Beled finally collected himself into a less minatory posture, saluted, and extended his hand in return.The Teklans hand gripped the Neoanders just a few centimeters away from Kath Twos face.She could hear the knuckles cracking as they tested each others strength.Standing on the far side of this spectacle was Ty, watching it with an expression that was not all that easy to read, given that the damaged side of his face was toward her.But she thought she detected a certain level of wry amusement, perhaps a little dampened by awe.Ty caught Kath Two looking, then shook his head and snorted.I hope I didnt overdress, Bard remarked, after he and Beled had finally let go of each other without incident.I sometimes overcompensate when I come to Cradle.Is that often?Ty asked.Kath Two understood that Bards remark had been a conversational gambit and not just a bald assertion.Ty, with the social reflexes of a Dinan bartender, had recognized it as such and was already following up.Its actually surprising that you and I have never crossed paths before, Bard said, addressing Ty but watching Kath Two out of the corner of his eye.Only after she had sat down in one of the available chairs did he resume his seat.He picked up the empty glass.I noted on your drinks list that you cellar some surface produce.Thank you for the beer, by the way.Youre most welcome, Ty said.I have spent most of my life on the surface, Bard explained, where some members of my clan grow grapes.We produce wine.Our primary market is restaurants in Cradle, though we do ship a few cases up to private cellars on the Great Chain.Well then, thats one explanation for our not having met, Ty said.Kath Two interpreted this to mean The Crows Nest generally doesnt stock such high end wine, but Bard got a sly look on his face and, after a moment, returned, Did you have another possible explanation in mind, Ty?Where is your clans vineyard?Beled demanded.Then, in a belated attempt to soften it, he added, If you dont mind.Oh, its not a secret, Bard said.Antimer.Just near the line of demarcation.She didnt know much about the place but she could visualize it: a crescent shaped archipelago in the middle latitudes between the Aleutians and Hawaii.It was the rim of a huge impact crater.Some of the islands were fairly large.The largest of them straddled the antimeridian180 degrees east or west of Greenwichwhich was the origin of the name.But most of the archipelago lay to the east of there, stretching all the way across the longitude of 166 degrees, 30 minutes west.That was the location of one of the two turnpikes that the Adans had built across the ring.It was as far west as the Eye could travel, and so it served as a border between Red and Blue.Since it was in the middle of the Pacific, which, notwithstanding the best efforts of the Hard Rain, was still largely an empty expanse of water, there wasnt much of a land border.166 Thirty did cross through Beringia: the union of Alaska with the easternmost part of Siberia.A land border did, therefore, exist in that place as well as in the somewhat more climatically benign part of Antimer lying a few thousand kilometers due south.This was the line of demarcation that Bard had alluded to, carefully omitting mention of on which side of it the vineyard was actually located.The border was fuzzy.There was no need to bother with strict enforcement on a world so thinly populated.The much longer land border at ninety degrees east, above Dhaka, wandered all over the place as it rambled north across the broadest part of Asia, squirming this way and that to circumvent craters, Himalayas, and other complications.The general picture that Bard had therefore conveyed, in just a few words, was something like this.His clanwhatever that meantof Neoanders had gone down to the surface as soon as it had become livable.They might have been Sooners (which was what Kath Two had been assuming of Tyuratam Lake) but, given their race, it was more probable that they had been military, sent down to Antimerwhich was a fairly inviting piece of real estateto secure it.For most of the Antimer chain lay on the Red side of the line of demarcation and constituted a valuable possession.But it had this troublesome extension onto the other side where Blue could, if it chose, establish a beachhead.From there, military incursions might be made westward in the event that the treaty failed.All of these things had come to pass during the War in the Woods.During the treaty negotiations that had concluded it, Red had made efforts to claim all of Antimer for itselfeffectively defining a little eastward excursion in the Line of Demarcation that would rid it of this particular thorn in its side.No agreement had been reached on that item, so it remained in dispute.Had more people been living there, there might have been a demilitarized zone, a no mans land, and all the other apparatus of disputed Cold War boundaries.As it was, things were just fuzzy.A tacit agreement was in place not to stir up trouble.But on both sides it was heavily populated with military settlements, and/or Survey installations, just to keep an eye on things.The obvious explanation for a lot of Neoanders living there was that theyd been sent down as a military force and brought their families with them.Upon the expiration of their term of service, they had declined the invitation to return to whatever crowded space habitat had been their place of origin and had dispersed into the countryside, which was said to be a very nice place to live.This was technically illegal but Red authorities had probably looked the other way, figuring that seeding the place with Neoanders could only strengthen their hold on it.Their Neanderthal heritage had been fabricated out of whole cloth, yet it was taken more or less seriously by everyoneit was a sort of consensual historical hallucination.Ada and some of her more bloody minded descendants might have hoped it would instill fear of, or at least respect for, the fighting prowess of this subrace.Some Neoanders reveled in that.Many of them, however, preferred a revisionist view of Neanderthal history that painted them as highly intelligent (their brains were larger than those of modern humans), artistically gifted, and essentially peaceful proto Europeans.Neoanders of a more intellectual bent held seminars about it.More practical minded ones tried to live it.There was no better place to live it, Kath Two had to admit, than Antimer, which had a temperate European style climate.And so it was entirely plausible that a group of Neoanders who had been sent down by Red as shock troops would, within a generation or two, end up running vineyards in that fuzzily defined border zone near the line of demarcation and, once the vines had reached maturity, trying to sell wine on the ring.The early market would be high end connoisseurs and restaurants and so they would need a member of the clan who cleaned up well, had good manners, and knew how to wear clothes, to establish commercial contacts in places like Cradle.This entire picture, or something close to it, was summoned up in the minds of Kath Two and, presumably, Ty and Beled and the others as soon as the words were spoken.But Tys remarkThats one explanation for our not having metand Bards nonanswerDid you have another possible explanation in mind?were still lodged there awkwardly.Was Ty meaning to question Bards story?The look on Arianes face, as she regarded the Neoander, was not what you would call warm.But of course the Julian would be suspicious, would look for other explanations than what lay on the surface.Ty seemed to have noticed this too; his eyes were jumping back and forth between Ariane and Bard.Bard looked up at Ty and smiled, his huge upper lip pulling back to expose the row of yellowish enamel boulders planted in his upper jaw.Ill bet that as our Seven spends time together, Tyuratam and I will have all sorts of opportunities to tell colorful stories about what our families have gotten up to during their decades on the surface.Which didnt answer the question.But it was charming, and it deflected the issue by making the point that Tyuratam Lakes background, should he choose to discuss it with them, was likely to be at least as complicated as that of Langobard.Perhaps a bit of guilt tripping there too, implicitly asking them why they were so curious about the Neoander when other members of the Seven might be worthy of some scrutiny too.Ariane sat back in her chair and pretended to look at her fingernails.She was not the least bit satisfied.Trying for a minute to think like a Julian, Kath Two imagined how it must look to her: a creature selectively bred by crazy people to be capable of killing with his bare hands, who at the same time was extraordinarily crafty in his social interactions.I am what I am, Ty said.And what is that?Ariane asked.A bartender.Always happy to make new acquaintances.He nodded at Bard.Or to provide guests with drinks.Anyone thirsty?No one admitted to being thirsty.For beverages, I meant, Ty added.Im sure we are all thirsty for knowledge.Doc liked that.Knowledge in general, Tyuratam?Oh, Id be living on Stromness if I were a knowledge in general man, Ty said.A collector of facts.No, I take a more utilitarian stance.Meaning that you would like to know why we are here, Doc said.Ty seemed to find the question overly blunt, and raised the ridge of scar tissue that had once been a honey colored eyebrow.If youd enjoy saying something about it, Id enjoy listening, he admitted.If not, well, Im willing to come along for the rideup to a point.Doc now looked across the table toward Ariane, in a way that made tumblers click inside of Kath Twos head.He was handing control of the meeting to Ariane.It might be going too far to say that she was in charge, but she was probably in communication with whoever was.Most of our operations will be on the surface, she said.You might have inferred as much from the fact that we have gone out of our way to involve Indigensshe glanced at Ty and Bardand Survey personnel.She nodded at Kath Two and at Beled.The last gesture elicited another one of those sardonic snorts from Typointing out, apparently, just how implausible it was that a man fitting the profile of Lieutenant Tomov could possibly be taken seriously as a member of Survey.Ariane gave Ty a cool look, as if to say Dont start, then continued: And I need hardly belabor the longstanding connection with the surface embodied by Doc and Memmie.Conspicuously absent from the list, now, was Ariane herself, but if she was aware of the omission, she didnt show it.Everyone was left to make what guesses and assumptions they might about how her careerwhatever it might bewas connected with the surface.Discretion is important, Ariane continued, which is why we will tend to operate out of Cradle and use atmospheric or surface transportation.Meaning airplanes and things that crawled on the surface of New Earth as opposed to rocket ships, bolos, and Aitken Kucharski devices like giant whips.Whenever possible, we will enter and exit Cradle on footvia the subterranean passages that are afforded by sockets.Whens the next Kath Two started to ask.Cayambe, Ariane said.Two days from now.We are going to travel from Cayambe to Beringia on the surface?Kath Two asked.Ty and Bard both looked at her curiously.I havent said anything about Beringia, Ariane pointed out.But its obviously where were going, Kath Two said.Its where Beled and Iand a lot of other peoplewere sent on Survey.Its where I saw what I saw, and told Beled about it.This whole thing was precipitated by that, wasnt it?It has been brewing for longer.Years, Ariane said.But youre not wrong.Tys from that part of the worldI can tell by his accent.Bard is from south of there, on Antimer, Kath Two went on.We will head north from the Cayambe Socket, yes, Ariane said.North a hell of a long way, Ty pointed out.We are not prevented from using air transport, Ariane reminded him.If we can get a big enough glider, Kath Two put in, the mountain wave will take us right up the Andes, the Sierras, and the Cascades in a day or two.I am fairly confident, Ariane said, that we can get a big enough glider.THE UNDERSURFACE OF CRADLE, ONLY VISIBLE TO PEOPLE STANDING on the groundmore specifically, on the equatorlooking up at it, was flat and generally egg shaped, elongated in the direction of its east west movement.On closer inspection its mostly smooth surface was interrupted from place to place by small hatches, carefully engineered protrusions, orifices, and other details.These were distributed around that otherwise featureless surface in a way that suggested orderly minds at work, addressing complications posed by the asymmetries of the city above.In several places along the equator of New Earth, ground had been cleared and flattened, and reinforced concrete pads laid.These had the same size and shape as Cradles undersurface, and were equipped with their own hatches and orifices matching those on Cradle.Cradle could be neatly set down into one of these sockets whenever the Eye happened to be directly overhead.There it might reside for hours or days, taking on or discharging supplies, and otherwise communing with the surroundings.But it never stayed for long, since it had to follow the movements of the Eye, which always had urgent business elsewhere on the ring.At such times, a traveler who knew nothing of orbiting tethers and the like, emerging from the woods or cresting some nearby hill, and coming into view of Cradle, would perceive it as a normal, which was to say stationary, city.The bucket handle arching high over its top was a heavy hint that something was a bit odd about it.Other than that, however, it would look, in that context, like a somewhat isolated hill fort.Some of the more well established sockets had begun to accumulate suburbs: ring shaped towns that would come to life whenever Cradle was in residence.Most of them had the feel, and shared the purposes, of military bases, scientific installations, and frontier outposts.It had always been envisioned that many such would be built in time, creating a ring around the equator to match the habitat ring far above it, and that once New Earth was opened for general settlement they would grow into important cities.To visit one now, centuries before its glorious peak, was something of an acquired tastea little like walking around a building site after foundations have been laid and a few walls framed.Builders, dreamers, and people of imagination enjoyed such places; others saw nothing.Cayambe and Kenya had been the first two sockets, built in the most likely sites on South America and Africa respectively.Each numbered around ten thousand souls.Cayambes namesake was a volcano at the intersection of the Andes and the equator, in what had once been the country of Ecuador.
