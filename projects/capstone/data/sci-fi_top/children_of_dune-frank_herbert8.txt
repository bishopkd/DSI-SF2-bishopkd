= = = = = =   Natural selection has been described as an environment selectively screening for those who will have progeny.Where humans are concerned, though, this is an extremely limiting viewpoint.Reproduction by sex tends toward experiment and innovation.It raises many questions, including the ancient one about whether environment is a selective agent after the variation occurs, or whether environment plays a pre selective role in determining the variations which it screens.Dune did not realty answer those questions: it merely raised new questions which Leto and the Sisterhood may attempt to answer over the next five hundred generations.The Dune Catastrophe, After Harq al Ada   The bare brown rocks of the Shield Wall loomed in the distance, visible to Ghanima as the embodiment of that apparition which threatened her future.She stood at the edge of the roof garden atop the Keep, the setting sun at her back.The sun held a deep orange glow from intervening dust clouds, a color as rich as the rim of a worm's mouth.She sighed, thinking: Alia...Alia...Is your fate to be my fate?The inner lives had grown increasingly clamorous of late.There was something about female conditioning in a Fremen society   perhaps it was a real sexual difference, but whatever   the female was more susceptible to that inner tide.Her grandmother had warned about it as they'd schemed, drawing on the accumulated wisdom of the Bene Gesserit but awakening that wisdom's threats within Ghanima."Abomination;" the Lady Jessica had said, "our term for the pre born, has a long history of bitter experiences behind it.The way of it seems to be that the inner lives divide.They split into the benign and the malignant.The benign remain tractable, useful.The malignant appear to unite in one powerful psyche, trying to take over the living flesh and its consciousness.The process is known to take considerable time, but its signs are well known. ""Why did you abandon Alia?"Ghanima asked."I fled in terror of what I'd created," Jessica said, her voice low."I gave up.And my burden now is that...perhaps I gave up too soon. ""What do you mean?""I cannot explain yet, but...maybe...no!I'll not give you false hopes.Ghafla, the abominable distraction, has a long history in human mythology.It was called many things, but chiefly it was called possession.That's what it seems to be.You lose your way in the malignancy and it takes possession of you. ""Leto...feared the spice," Ghanima said, finding that she could talk about him quietly.The terrible price demanded of them!"And wisely," Jessica had said.She would say no more.But Ghanima had risked an explosion of her inner memories, peering past an odd blurred veil and futilely expanding on the Bene Gesserit fears.To explain what had befallen Alia did not ease it one bit.The Bene Gesserit accumulation of experience had pointed to a possible way out of the trap, though, and when Ghanima ventured the inner sharing, she first called upon the Mohalata, a partnership of the benign which might protect her.She recalled that sharing as she stood in the sunset glow at the edge of the Keep's roof garden.Immediately she felt the memory presence of her mother.Chani stood there, an apparition between Ghanima and the distant cliffs."Enter here and you will eat the fruit of the Zaqquum, the food of hell!"Chani said."Bar this door, my daughter; it is your only safety. "The inner clamor lifted itself around the vision and Ghanima fled, sinking her consciousness into the Sisterhood's Credo, reacting out of desperation more than trust.Quickly she recited the Credo, moving her lips, letting her voice rise to a whisper:  "Religion is the emulation of the adult by the child.Religion is the encystment of past beliefs: mythology, which is guesswork, the hidden assumptions of trust in the universe, those pronouncements which men have made in search of personal power, all of it mingled with shreds of enlightenment.And always the ultimate unspoken commandment is 'Thou shall not question!'But we question.We break that commandment as a matter of course.The work to which we have set ourselves is the liberating of the imagination, the harnessing of imagination to humankind's deepest sense of creativity. "Slowly a sense of order returned to Ghanima's thoughts.She felt her body trembling, though, and knew how fragile was this peace she had attained   and that blurring veil remained in her mind."Leb Kamai," she whispered."Heart of my enemy, you shall not be my heart. "And she called up a memory of Farad'n's features, the saturnine young face with its heavy brows and firm mouth.Hate will make me strong, she thought.In hate, I can resist Alia's fate.But the trembling fragility of her position remained, and all she could think about was how much Farad'n resembled his uncle, the late Shaddam IV."Here you are!"It was Irulan coming up from Ghanima's right, striding along the parapet with movements reminiscent of a man.Turning, Ghanima thought: And she's Shaddam's daughter."Why will you persist in sneaking out alone?"Irulan demanded, stopping in front of Ghanima and towering over her with a scowling face.Ghanima refrained from saying that she was not alone, that guards had seen her emerge onto the roof.Irulan's anger went to the fact that they were in the open here and that a distant weapon might find them."You're not wearing a stillsuit," Ghanima said."Did you know that in the old days someone caught outside the sietch without a stillsuit was automatically killed.To waste water was to endanger the tribe. ""Water!Water!"Irulan snapped."I want to know why you endanger yourself this way.Come back inside.You make trouble for all of us. ""What danger is there now?"Ghanima asked."Stilgar has purged the traitors.Alia's guards are everywhere. "Irulan peered upward at the darkening sky.Stars were already visible against a grey blue backdrop.She returned her attention to Ghanima."I won't argue.I was sent to tell you we have word from Farad'n.He accepts, but for some reason he wishes to delay the ceremony. ""How long?""We don't know yet.It's being negotiated.But Duncan is being sent home. ""And my grandmother?""She chooses to stay on Salusa for the time being. ""Who can blame her?"Ghanima asked."That silly fight with Alia!""Don't try to gull me, Irulan!That was no silly fight.I've heard the stories. ""The Sisterhood's fears  "  "Are real," Ghanima said."Well, you've delivered your message.Will you use this opportunity to have another try at dissuading me?""I've given up. ""You should know better than to try lying to me," Ghanima said."Very well!I'll keep trying to dissuade you.This course is madness. "And Irulan wondered why she let Ghanima become so irritating.A Bene Gesserit didn't need to be irritated at anything.She said: "I'm concerned by the extreme danger to you.You know that.Ghani, Ghani...you're Paul's daughter.How can you  "  "Because I'm his daughter," Ghanima said."We Atreides go back to Agamemnon and we know what's in our blood.Never forget that, childless wife of my father.We Atreides have a bloody history and we're not through with the blood. "Distracted, Irulan asked: "Who's Agamemnon?""How sparse your vaunted Bene Gesserit education proves itself," Ghanima said."I keep forgetting that you foreshorten history.But my memories go back to... "She broke off; best not to arouse those shades from their fragile sleep."Whatever you remember," Irulan said, "you must know how dangerous this course is to  "  "I'll kill him," Ghanima said."He owes me a life. ""And I'll prevent it if I can. ""We already know this.You won't get the opportunity.Alia is sending you south to one of the new towns until after it's done. "Irulan shook her head in dismay."Ghani, I took my oath that I'd guard you against any danger.I'll do it with my own life if necessary.If you think I'm going to languish in some brickwalled djedida while you... ""There's always the Huanui," Ghanima said, speaking softly."We have the deathstill as an alternative.I'm sure you couldn't interfere from there. "Irulan paled, put a hand to her mouth, forgetting for a moment all of her training.It was a measure of how much care she had invested in Ghanima, this almost complete abandonment of everything except animal fear.She spoke out of that shattering emotion, allowing it to tremble on her lips."Ghani, I don't fear for myself.I'd throw myself into the worm's mouth for you.Yes, I'm what you call me, the childless wife of your father, but you're the child I never had.I beg you... "Tears glistened at the corners of her eyes.Ghanima fought down a tightness in her throat, said: "There is another difference between us.You were never Fremen.I'm nothing else.This is a chasm which divides us.Alia knows.Whatever else she may be, she knows this. ""You can't tell what Alia knows," Irulan said, speaking bitterly."If I didn't know her for Atreides, I'd swear she has set herself to destroy her own Family. "And how do you know she's still Atreides?Ghanima thought, wondering at this blindness in Irulan.This was a Bene Gesserit, and who knew better than they the history of Abomination?She would not let herself even think about it, let alone believe it.Alia must have worked some witchery on this poor woman.Ghanima said: "I owe you a water debt.For that, I'll guard your life.But your cousin's forfeit.Say no more of that. "Irulan stilled the trembling of her lips, wiped her eyes."I did love your father," she whispered."I didn't even know it until he was dead. ""Perhaps he isn't dead," Ghanima said."This Preacher... ""Ghani!Sometimes I don't understand you.Would Paul attack his own family?"Ghanima shrugged, looked out at the darkening sky."He might find amusement in such a  "  "How can you speak so lightly of this  "  "To keep away the dark depths," Ghanima said."I don't taunt you.The gods know I don't.But I'm just my father's daughter.I'm every person who's contributed seed to the Atreides.You won't think of Abomination, but I can't think of anything else.I'm the pre born.I know what's within me. ""That foolish old superstition about  "  "Don't!"Ghanima reached a hand toward Irulan's mouth."I'm every Bene Gesserit of their damnable breeding program up to and including my grandmother.And I'm very much more. "She tore at her left palm, drawing blood with a fingernail."This is a young body, but its experiences...Oh, gods.Irulan!My experiences!No!"She put out her hand once more as Irulan moved closer."I know all of those futures which my father explored.I've the wisdom of so many lifetimes, and all the ignorance, too...all the frailties.If you'd help me, Irulan, first learn who I am. "Instinctively Irulan bent and gathered Ghanima into her arms, holding her close, cheek against cheek.Don't let me have to kill this woman.Ghanima thought.Don't let that happen.As this thought swept through her, the whole desert passed into night.= = = = = =   One small bird has called thee From a beak streaked crimson.It cried once over Sietch Tabr And thou went forth unto Funeral Plain.Lament for Leto II   Leto awoke to the tinkle of water rings in a woman's hair.He looked to the open doorway of his cell and saw Sabiha sitting there.In the half immersed awareness of the spice he saw her outlined by all that his vision revealed about her.She was two years past the age when most Fremen women were wed or at least betrothed.Therefore her family was saving her for something...or someone.She was nubile...obviously.His vision shrouded eyes saw her as a creature out of humankind's Terranic past: dark hair and pale skin, deep sockets which gave her blue in blue eyes a greenish cast.She possessed a small nose and a wide mouth above a sharp chin.And she was a living signal to him that the Bene Gesserit plan was known   or suspected   here in Jacurutu.So they hoped to revive Pharaonic Imperialism through him, did they?Then what was their design to force him into marrying his sister?Surely Sabiha could not prevent that.His captors knew the plan, though.And how had they learned it?They'd not shared its vision.They'd not gone with him where life became a moving membrane in other dimensions.The reflexive and circular subjectivity of the visions which revealed Sabiha were his and his alone.Again the water rings tinkled in Sabiha's hair and the sound stirred up his visions.He knew where he had been and what he had learned.Nothing could erase that.He was not riding a great Maker palanquin now, the tinkle of water rings among the passengers a rhythm for their passage songs.No...He was here in the cell of Jacurutu, embarked on that most dangerous of all journeys: away from and back to the Ahl as sunna wal jamas, from the real world of the senses and back to that world.What was she doing there with the water rings tinkling in her hair?Oh, yes.She was mixing more of the brew which they thought held him captive: food laced with spice essence to keep him half in and half out of the real universe until either he died or his grandmother's plan succeeded.And every time he thought he'd won, they sent him back.The Lady Jessica was right, of course   that old witch!But what a thing to do.The total recall of all those lives within him was of no use at all until he could organize the data and remember it at will.Those lives had been the raw stuff of anarchy.One or all of them could have overwhelmed him.The spice and its peculiar setting here in Jacurutu had been a desperate gamble.Now Gurney waits for the sign and I refuse to give it to him.How long will his patience last?He stared out at Sabiha.She'd thrown her hood back and revealed the tribal tattoos at her temples.Leto did not recognize the tattoos at first, then remembered where he was.Yes, Jacurutu still lived.Leto did not know whether to be thankful toward his grandmother or hate her.She wanted him to have conscious level instincts.But instincts were only racial memories of how to handle crises.His direct memories of those other lives told him far more than that.He had it all organized now, and could see the peril of revealing himself to Gurney.No way of keeping the revelation from Namri.And Namri was another problem.Sabiha entered the cell with a bowl in her hands.He admired the way the light from outside made rainbow circles at the edges of her hair.Gently she raised his head and began feeding him from the bowl.It was only then he realized how weak he was.He allowed her to feed him while his mind went roving, recalling the session with Gurney and Namri.They believed him!Namri more than Gurney, but even Gurney could not deny what his senses had already reported to him about the planet.Sabiha wiped his mouth with a hem of her robe.Ahhh, Sabiha, he thought, recalling that other vision which filled his heart with pain.Many nights have I dreamed beside the open water, hearing the winds pass overhead.Many nights my flesh lay beside the snake's den and I dreamed of Sabiha in the summer heat.I saw her storing spice bread baked on red hot sheets of plasteel.I saw the clear water in the qanat, gentle and shining, but a storm wind ran through my heart.She sips coffee and eats.Her teeth shine in the shadows.I see her braiding my water rings into her hair.The amber fragrance of her bosom strikes through to my innermost senses.She torments me and oppresses me by her very existence.The pressure of his multi memories exploded the time frozen englobement which he had tried to resist.He felt twining bodies, the sounds of sex, rhythms laced in every sensory impression: lips, breathing, moist breaths, tongues.Somewhere in his vision there were helix shapes, coal colored, and he felt the beat of those shapes as they turned within him.A voice pleaded in his skull: "Please, please, please, please... "There was an adult beefswelling in his loins and he felt his mouth open, holding, clinging to the girder shape of ecstasy.Then a sigh, a lingering groundswelling sweetness, a collapse.Oh, how sweet to let that come into existence!"Sabiha," he whispered."Oh, my Sabiha. "When her charge had clearly gone deeply into the trance after his food, Sabiha took the bowl and left, pausing at the doorway to speak to Namri."He called my name again. ""Go back and stay with him," Namri said."I must find Halleck and discuss this with him. "Sabiha deposited the bowl beside the doorway and returned to the cell.She sat on the edge of the cot, staring at Leto's shadowed face.Presently he opened his eyes and put a hand out, touching her cheek.He began to talk to her then, telling her about the vision in which she had lived.She covered his hand with her own as he spoke.How sweet he was...how very swee   She sank onto the cot, cushioned by his hand, unconscious before he pulled the hand away.Leto sat up, feeling the depths of his weakness.The spice and its visions had drained him.He searched through his cells for every spare spark of energy, climbed from the cot without disturbing Sabiha.He had to go, but he knew he'd not get far.Slowly he sealed his stillsuit, drew the robe around him, slipped through the passage to the outer shaft.There were a few people about, busy at their own affairs.They knew him, but he was not their responsibility.Namri and Halleck would know what he was doing; Sabiha could not be far away.He found the kind of side passage he needed and walked boldly down it.Behind him Sabiha slept peacefully until Halleck roused her.She sat up, rubbed her eyes, saw the empty cot, saw her uncle standing behind Halleck, the anger on their faces.Namri answered the expression on her face: "Yes, he's gone. ""How could you let him escape?"Halleck raged."How is this possible?""He was seen going toward the lower exit," Namri said, his voice oddly calm.Sabiha cowered in front of them, remembering."How?"Halleck demanded."I don't know.I don't know. ""It's night and he's weak," Namri said."He won't get far. "Halleck whirled on him."You want the boy to die!""It wouldn't displease me. "Again Halleck confronted Sabiha."Tell me what happened. ""He touched my cheek.He kept talking about his vision...us together. "She looked down at the empty cot."He made me sleep.He put some magic on me. "Halleck glanced at Namri."Could he be hiding inside somewhere?""Nowhere inside.He'd be found, seen.He was headed for the exit.He's out there. ""Magic," Sabiha muttered."No magic," Namri said."He hypnotized her.Almost did it to me, you remember?Said I was his friend. ""He's very weak," Halleck said."Only in his body," Namri said."He won't go far, though.I disabled the heel pumps of his stillsuit.He'll die with no water if we don't find him. "Halleck almost turned and struck Namri, but held himself in rigid control.Jessica had warned him that Namri might have to kill the lad.Gods below!What a pass they'd come to, Atreides against Atreides.He said: "Is it possible he just wandered away in the spice trance?""What difference does it make?"Namri asked."If he escapes us he must die. ""We'll start searching at first light," Halleck said."Did he take a Fremkit?""There're always a few beside the doorseal," Namri said."He'd've been a fool not to take one.Somehow he has never struck me as a fool. ""Then send a message to our friends," Halleck said."Tell them what's happened. ""No messages this night," Namri said."There's a storm coming.The tribes have been tracking it for three days now.It'll be here by midnight.Already communication's blanked out.The satellites signed off this sector two hours ago. "A deep sigh shook Halleck.The boy would die out there for sure if the sandblast storm caught him.It would eat the flesh from his bones and sliver the bones to fragments.The contrived false death would become real.He slapped a fist into an open palm.The storm could trap them in the sietch.They couldn't even mount a search.And storm static had already isolated the sietch."Distrans," he said, thinking they might imprint a message onto a bat's voice and dispatch it with the alarm.Namri shook his head."Bats won't fly in a storm.Come on, man.They're more sensitive than we are.They'll cower in the cliffs until it's past.Best to wait for the satellites to pick us up again.Then we can try to find his remains. ""Not if he took a Fremkit and hid in the sand," Sabiha said.Cursing under his breath, Halleck whirled away from them, strode out into the sietch.= = = = = =   Peace demands solutions, but we never reach living solutions; we only work toward them.A fixed solution is, by definition, a dead solution.The trouble with peace is that it tends to punish mistakes instead of rewarding brilliance.The Words of My Father: an account of Muad'Dib reconstructed by Harq al Ada   "She's training him?She's training Farad'n?"Alia glared at Duncan Idaho with a deliberate mix of anger and incredulity.The Guild heighliner had swung into orbit around Arrakis at noon local.An hour later the lighter had put Idaho down at Arrakeen, unannounced, but all casual and open.Within minutes a 'thopter had deposited him atop the Keep.Warned of his impending arrival, Alia had greeted him there, coldly formal before her guards, but now they stood in her quarters beneath the north rim.He had just delivered his report, truthfully, precisely, emphasizing each datum in mentat fashion."She has taken leave of her senses," Alia said.He treated the statement as a mentat problem."All the indicators are that she remains well balanced, sane.I should say her sanity index was  "  "Stop that!"Alia snapped."What can she be thinking of?"Idaho, who knew that his own emotional balance depended now upon retreat into mentat coldness, said: "I compute she is thinking of her granddaughter's betrothal. "His features remained carefully bland, a mask for the raging grief which threatened to engulf him.There was no Alia here.Alia was dead.For a time he'd maintained a myth Alia before his senses, someone he'd manufactured out of his own needs, but a mentat could carry on such self deception for only a limited time.This creature in human guise was possessed; a demon psyche drove her.His steely eyes with their myriad facets available at will reproduced upon his vision centers a multiplicity of myth Alias.But when he combined them into a single image, no Alia remained.Her features moved to other demands.She was a shell within which outrages had been committed."Where's Ghanima?"he asked.She waved the question aside."I've sent her with Irulan to stay in Stilgar's keeping. "Neutral territory, he thought.There's been another negotiation with rebellious tribes.She's losing ground and doesn't know it...or does she?Is there another reason?Has Stilgar gone over to her?"The betrothal," Alia mused."What are conditions in the Corrino House?""Salusa swarms with outrine relatives, all working upon Farad'n, hoping for a share in his return to power. ""And she's training him in the Bene Gesserit... ""Is it not fitting for Ghanima's husband?"Alia smiled to herself, thinking of Ghanima's adamant rage.Let Farad'n be trained.Jessica was training a corpse.It would all work out."I must consider this at length," she said."You're very quiet, Duncan. ""I await your questions. ""I see.You know, I was very angry with you.Taking her to Farad'n!""You commanded me to make it real. ""I was forced to put out the report that you'd both been taken captive," she said."I obeyed your orders. ""You're so literal at times, Duncan.You almost frighten me.But if you hadn't, well... ""The Lady Jessica's out of harm's way," he said."And for Ghanima's sake we should be grateful that  "  "Exceedingly grateful," she agreed.And she thought: He's no longer trustworthy.He has that damnable Atreides loyalty.I must make an excuse to send him away...and have him eliminated.An accident, of course.She touched his cheek.Idaho forced himself to respond to the caress, taking her hand and kissing it."Duncan, Duncan, how sad it is," she said."But I cannot keep you here with me.Too much is happening and I've so few I can completely trust. "He released her hand, waited."I was forced to send Ghanima to Tabr," she said."Things are in deep unrest here.Raiders from the Broken Lands breached the qanats at Kagga Basin and spilled all of their waters into the sands.Arrakeen was on short rations.The Basin's alive with sandtrout yet, reaping the water harvest.They're being dealt with, of course, but we're spread very thin. "He'd already noted how few amazons of Alia's guard were to be seen in the Keep.And he thought: The Maquis of the Inner Desert will keep on probing her defenses.Doesn't she know that?"Tabr is still neutral territory," she said."Negotiations are continuing there right now.Javid's there with a delegation from the Priesthood.But I'd like you at Tabr to watch them, especially Irulan. ""She is Corrino," he agreed.But he saw in her eyes that she was rejecting him.How transparent this Alia creature had become!She waved a hand."Go now, Duncan, before I soften and keep you here beside me.I've missed you so... ""And I've missed you," he said, allowing all of his grief to flow into his voice.She stared at him, startled by the sadness.Then: "For my sake, Duncan. "And she thought: Too bad, Duncan.She said: "Zia will take you to Tabr.We need the 'thopter back here. "Her pet amazon, he thought: I must be careful of that one."I understand," he said, once more taking her hand and kissing it.He stared at the dear flesh which once had been his Alia's.He could not bring himself to look at her face as he left.Someone else stared back at him from her eyes.As he mounted to the Keep's roof pad, Idaho probed a growing sense of unanswered questions.The meeting with Alia had been extremely trying for the mentat part of him which kept reading data signs.He waited beside the 'thopter with one of the Keep's amazons, stared grimly southward.Imagination took his gaze beyond the Shield Wall to Sietch Tabr.Why does Zia take me to Tabr?Returning a 'thopter is a menial task.What is the delay?Is Zia getting special instructions?Idaho glanced at the watchful guard, mounted to the pilot's position in the 'thopter.He leaned out, said: "Tell Alia I'll send the 'thopter back immediately with one of Stilgar's men. "Before the guard could protest he closed the door and started the 'thopter.He could see her standing there indecisively.Who could question Alia's consort?He had the 'thopter airborne before she could make up her mind what to do.Now, alone in the 'thopter, he allowed his grief to spend itself in great wracking sobs.Alia was gone.They had parted forever.Tears flowed from his Tleilaxu eyes and he whispered: "Let all the waters of Dune flow into the sand.They will not match my tears. "This was a non mentat excess, though, and he recognized it as such, forcing himself to sober assessment of present necessities.The 'thopter demanded his attention.The reactions of flying brought him some relief, and he had himself once more in hand.Ghanima with Stilgar again.And Irulan.Why had Zia been designated to accompany him?He made it a mentat problem and the answer chilled him.I was to have a fatal accident.= = = = = =   This rocky shrine to the skull of a ruler grants no prayers.It has become the grave of lamentations.Only the wind hears the voice of this place.The cries of night creatures and the passing wonder of two moons, all say his day has ended.No more supplicants come.The visitors have gone from the feast.How bare the pathway down this mountain.Lines at the Shrine of an Atreides Duke, Anon.The thing had the deceptive appearance of simplicity to Leto: avoiding the vision, do that which has not been seen.He knew the trap in his thought, how the casual threads of a locked future twisted themselves together until they held you fast, but he had a new grip on those threads.Nowhere had he seen himself running from Jacurutu.The thread to Sabiha must be cut first.He crouched now in the last daylight at the eastern edge of the rock which protected Jacurutu.His Fremkit had produced energy tablets and food.He waited now for strength.To the west lay Lake Azrak, the gypsum plain where once there'd been open water in the days before the worm.Unseen to the east lay the Bene Sherk, a scattering of new settlements encroaching upon the open bled.To the south lay the Tanzerouft, the Land of Terror: thirty eight hundred kilometers of wasteland broken only by patches of grass locked dunes and windtraps to water them   the work of the ecological transformation remaking the landscape of Arrakis.They were serviced by airborne teams and no one stayed for long.I will go south, he told himself.Gurney will expect me to do that.This was not the moment to do the completely unexpected.It would be dark soon and he could leave this temporary hiding place.He stared at the southern skyline.There was a whistling of dun sky along that horizon, rolling there like smoke, a burning line of undulant dust   a storm.He watched the high center of the storm rising up out of the Great Flat like a questing worm.For a full minute he watched the center, saw that it did not move to the right or the left.The old Fremen saying leaped into his mind: When the center does not move, you are in its path.That storm changed matters.For a moment he stared back westward the direction of Tabr, feeling the deceptive grey tan peace of the desert evening, seeing the white gypsum pan edged by wind rounded pebbles, the desolate emptiness with its unreal surface of glaring white reflecting dust clouds.Nowhere in any vision had he seen himself surviving the grey serpent of a mother storm or buried too deeply in sand to survive.There was only that vision of rolling in wind...but that might come later.And a storm was out there, winding across many degrees of latitude, whipping its world into submission.It could be risked.There were old stories, always heard from a friend of a friend, that one could lock an exhausted worm on the surface by propping a Maker hook beneath one of its wide rings and, having immobilized it, ride out a storm in the leeward shadow.There was a line between audacity and abandoned recklessness which tempted him.That storm would not come before midnight at the earliest.There was time.How many threads could be cut here?All, including the final one?Gurney will expect me to go south, but not into a storm.He stared down to the south, seeking a pathway, saw the fluent ebony brushstroke of a deep gorge curving through Jacurutu's rock.He saw sand curls in the bowels of the gorge, chimera sand.It uttered its haughty runnels onto the plain as though it were water.The gritty taste of thirst whispered in his mouth as he shouldered his Fremkit and let himself down onto the path which led into the canyon.It was still light enough that he might be seen, but he knew he was gambling with time.As he reached the canyon's lip, the quick night of the central desert fell upon him.He was left with the parched glissando of moonglow to light his way toward the Tanzerouft.He felt his heartbeat quicken with all of the fears which his wealth of memories provided.He sensed that he might be going down into Huanui naa, as Fremen fears labeled the greatest storms: the Earth's Deathstill.But whatever came, it would be visionless.Every step left farther behind him the spice induced dhyana, that spreading awareness of his intuitive creative nature with its unfolding to the motionless chain of causality.For every hundred steps he took now, there must be at least one step aside, beyond words and into communion with his newly grasped internal reality.One way or another, father, I'm coming to you.There were birds invisible in the rocks around him, making themselves known by small sounds.Fremen wise, he listened for their echoes to guide his way where he could not see.Often as he passed crannies he marked the baleful green of eyes, creatures crouched in hiding because they knew a storm approached.He emerged from the gorge onto the desert.Living sand moved and breathed beneath him, telling of deep actions and latent fumaroles.He looked back and up to the moon touched lava caps on Jacurutu's buttes.The whole structure was metamorphic, mostly pressure formed.Arrakis still had something to say in its own future.He planted his thumper to call a worm and, when it began beating against the sand, took his position to watch and listen.Unconsciously his right hand went to the Atreides hawk ring concealed in a knotted fold of his dishsasha.Gurney had found it, but had left it.What had he thought, seeing Paul's ring?Father, expect me soon.The worm came from the south.It angled in to avoid the rocks, not as large a worm as he'd hoped, but that could not be remedied.He gauged its passage, planted his hooks, and went up the scaled side with a quick scrambling as it swept over the thumper in a swishing dust spray.The worm turned easily under the pressure of his hooks.The wind of its passage began to whip his robe.He bent his gaze on the southern stars, dim through dust, and pointed the worm that way.Right into the storm.As First Moon rose, Leto gauged the storm height and put off his estimate of its arrival.Not before daylight.It was spreading out, gathering more energy for a great leap.There'd be plenty of work for the ecological transformation teams.It was as though the planet fought them with a conscious fury out here, the fury increasing as the transformation took in more land.All night he pressed the worm southward, sensing the reserves of its energy in the movements transmitted through his feet.Occasionally he let the beast fall off to the west which it was forever trying to do, moved by the invisible boundaries of its territory or by a deep seated awareness of the coming storm.Worms buried themselves to escape the sandblast winds, but this one would not sink beneath the desert while Maker hooks held any of its rings open.At midnight the worm was showing many signs of exhaustion.He moved back along its great ridges and worked the flail, allowing it to slow down but continuing to drive it southward.The storm arrived just after daybreak.First there was the beady stretched out immobility of the desert dawn pressing dunes one into another.Next, the advancing dust caused him to seal his face flaps.In the thickening dust the desert became a dun picture without lines.Then sand needles began cutting his cheeks, stinging his lids.He felt the coarse grit on his tongue and knew the moment of decision had come.Should he risk the old stories by immobilizing the almost exhausted worm?He took only a heartbeat to discard this choice, worked his way back to the worm's tail, slacked off his hooks.Barely moving now, the worm began to burrow.But the excesses of the creature's heat transfer system still churned up a cyclone oven behind him in the quickening storm.Fremen children learned the dangers of this position near the worm's tail with their earliest stories.Worms were oxygen factories; fire burned wildly in their passage, fed by the lavish exhalations from the chemical adaptations to friction within them.Sand began to whip around his feet.Leto loosed his hooks and leaped wide to avoid the furnace at the tail.Everything depended now on getting beneath the sand where the worm had loosened it.Grasping the static compaction tool in his left hand, he burrowed into a dune's slipface, knowing the worm was too tired to turn back and swallow him in its great white orange mouth.As he burrowed with his left hand, his right hand worked the stilltent from his Fremkit and he readied it for inflation.It was all done in less than a minute: he had the tent into a hard walled sand pocket on the lee face of a dune.He inflated the tent and crawled into it.Before sealing the sphincter, he reached out with the compaction tool, reversed its action.The slipface came sliding down over the tent.Only a few sand grains entered as he sealed the opening.Now he had to work even more quickly.No sandsnorkel would reach up there to keep him supplied with breathing air.This was a great storm, the kind few survived.It would cover this place with tons of sand.Only the tender bubble of the stilltent with its compacted outer shell would protect him.Leto stretched flat on his back, folded his hands over his breast and sent himself into a dormancy trance where his lungs would move only once an hour.In this he committed himself to the unknown.The storm would pass and, if it did not expose his fragile pocket, he might emerge...or he might enter the Madinat as salam, the Abode of Peace.Whatever happened, he knew he had to break the threads, one by one, leaving him at last only the Golden Path.It was that, or he could not return to the caliphate of his father's heirs.No more would he live the lie of that Desposyni, that terrible caliphate, chanting to the demiurge of his father.No more would he keep silent when a priest mouthed offensive nonsense: "His crysknife will dissolve demons!"With this commitment, Leto's awareness slipped into the web of timeless dao.= = = = = =   There exist obvious higher order influences in any planetary system.This is often demonstrated by introducing terraform life onto newly discovered planets.In all such cases, the life in similar zones develops striking similarities of adaptive form.This form signifies much more than shape; it connotes a survival organization and a relationship of such organizations.The human quest for this interdependent order and our niche within it represents a profound necessity.The quest can, however, be perverted into a conservative grip on sameness.This has always proved deadly for the entire system.The Dune Catastrophe, After Harq al Ada   "My son didn't really see the future; he saw the process of creation and its relationship to the myths in which men sleep," Jessica said.She spoke swiftly but without appearing to rush the matter.She knew the hidden observers would find a way to interrupt as soon as they recognized what she was doing.Farad'n sat on the floor outlined in a shaft of afternoon sunlight which slanted through the window behind him.Jessica could just see the top of a tree in the courtyard garden when she glanced across from her position standing against the far wall.It was a new Farad'n she saw: more slender, more sinewy.The months of training had worked their inevitable magic on him.His eyes glittered when he stared at her."He saw the shapes which existing forces would create unless they were diverted," Jessica said."Rather than turn against his fellow men, he turned against himself.He refused to accept only that which comforted him because that was moral cowardice. "Farad'n had learned to listen silently testing, probing, holding his questions until he had shaped them into a cutting edge.She had been talking about the Bene Gesserit view of molecular memory expressed as ritual and had, quite naturally, diverged to the Sisterhood's way of analyzing Paul Muad'Dib.Farad'n saw a shadow play in her words and actions, however, a projection of unconscious forms at variance with the surface intent of her statements."Of all our observations, this is the most crucial," she'd said."Life is a mask through which the universe expresses itself.We assume that all of humankind and its supportive life forms represent a natural community and that the fate of all life is at stake in the fate of the individual.Thus, when it comes to that ultimate self examination, the amor fati, we stop playing god and revert to teaching.In the crunch, we select individuals and we set them as free as we're able. "He saw now where she had to be going and knowing its effect upon those who watched through the spy eyes, refrained from casting an apprehensive glance at the door.Only a trained eye could have detected his momentary imbalance, but Jessica saw it and smiled.A smile, after all, could mean anything."This is a sort of graduation ceremony," she said."I'm very pleased with you, Farad'n.Will you stand, please. "He obeyed, blocking off her view of the treetop through the window behind him.Jessica held her arms stiffly at her side, said: "I am charged to say this to you.'I stand in the sacred human presence.As I do now, so should you stand someday.I pray to your presence that this be so.The future remains uncertain and so it should, for it is the canvas upon which we paint our desires.Thus always the human condition faces a beautifully empty canvas.We possess only this moment in which to dedicate ourselves continuously to the sacred presence which we share and create. '"  As Jessica finished speaking, Tyekanik came through the door on her left, moving with a false casualness which the scowl on his face belied."My Lord," he said.But it already was too late.Jessica's words and all of the preparation which had gone before had done their work.Farad'n no longer was Corrino.He was now Bene Gesserit.= = = = = =   What you of the CHOAM directorate seem unable to understand is that you seldom find real loyalties in commerce.When did you last hear of a clerk giving his life for the company?Perhaps your deficiency rests in the false assumption that you can order men to think and cooperate.This has been a failure of everything from religions to general staffs throughout history.General staffs have a long record of destroying their own nations.As to religions, I recommend a rereading of Thomas Aquinas.As to you of CHOAM, what nonsense you believe!Men must want to do things out of their own innermost drives.People, not commercial organizations or chains of command, are what make great civilizations work.Every civilization depends upon the quality of the individuals it produces.If you over organize humans, over legalize them, suppress their urge to greatness   they cannot work and their civilization collapses.A letter to CHOAM, Attributed to The Preacher   Leto came out of the trance with a softness of transition which did not define one condition as separate from another.One level of awareness simply moved into the other.He knew where he was.A restoration of energy surged through him, but he sensed another message from the stale deadliness of the oxygen depleted air within the stilltent.If he refused to move, he knew he would remain caught in the timeless web, the eternal now where all events coexisted.This prospect enticed him.He saw Time as a convention shaped by the collective mind of all sentience.Time and Space were categories imposed on the universe by his Mind.He had but to break free of the multiplicity where prescient visions lured him.Bold selection could change provisional futures.What boldness did this moment require?The trance state lured him.Leto felt that he had come from the alam al mythal into the universe of reality only to find them identical.He wanted to maintain the Rihani magic of this revelation, but survival demanded decisions of him.His relentless taste for life sent its signals along his nerves.Abruptly he reached out his right hand to where he had left the sand compaction tool.He gripped it, rolled onto his stomach, and breached the tent's sphincter.A pool of sand drifted across his hand.Working in darkness, goaded by the stale air, he worked swiftly, tunneling upward at a steep angle.Six times his body lengths he went before he broke out into darkness and clean air.He slipped out onto the moonlight windface of a long curving dune, found himself about a third of the way from the dune's top.It was Second Moon above him.It moved swiftly across him, departing beyond the dune, and the stars were laid out above him like bright rocks beside a path.Leto searched for the constellation of The Wanderer, found it, and let his gaze follow the outstretched arm to the brilliant glittering of Foum al Hout, the polar star of the south.There's your damned universe for you!he thought.Seen close up it was a hustling place like the sand all around him, a place of change, of uniqueness piled upon uniqueness.Seen from a distance, only the patterns lay revealed and those patterns tempted one to belief in absolutes.In absolutes, we may lose our way.This made him think of the familiar warning from a Fremen ditty: "Who loses his way in the Tanzerouft loses his life. "The patterns could guide and they could trap.One had to remember that patterns change.He took a deep breath, stirred himself into action.Sliding back down his passage, he collapsed the tent, brought it out and repacked the Fremkit.A wine glow began to develop along the eastern horizon.He shouldered the pack, climbed to the dunecrest and stood there in the chill predawn air until the rising sun felt warm on his right cheek.He stained his eyepits then to reduce reflection, knowing that he must woo this desert now rather than fight her.When he had put the stain back into the pack he sipped from one of his catchtubes, drew in a sputtering of drops and then air.Dropping to the sand, he began going over his stillsuit, coming at last to the heel pumps.They had been cut cleverly with a needle knife.He slipped out of the suit and repaired it, but the damage had been done.At least half of his body's water was gone.Were it not for the stilltent's catch...He mused on this as he donned the suit, thinking how odd it was that he'd not anticipated this.Here was an obvious danger of visionless future.Leto squatted on the dunetop then, pressed himself against the loneliness of this place.He let his gaze wander, fishing in the sand for a whistling vent, any irregularity of the dunes which might indicate spice or worm activity.But the storm had stamped its uniformity upon the land.Presently he removed a thumper from the kit, armed it, and sent it rotating to call Shai Hulud from his depths.He then moved off to wait.The worm was a long time coming.He heard it before he saw it, turned eastward where the earthshaking susurration made the air tremble, waited for the first glimpse of orange from the mouth rising out of the sand.The worm lifted itself from the depths in a gigantic hissing of dust which obscured its flanks.The curving grey wall swept past Leto and he planted his hooks, went up the side in easy steps.He turned the worm southward in a great curving track as he climbed.Under his goading hooks, the worm picked up speed.Wind whipped his robe against him.He felt himself to be goaded as the worm was goaded, an intense current of creation in his loins.Each planet has its own period and each life likewise, he reminded himself.The worm was a type Fremen called a "growler. "It frequently dug in its foreplates while the tail was driving.This produced rumbling sounds and caused part of its body to rise clear of the sand in a moving hump.It was a fast worm, though, and when they picked up a following wind the furnace exhalation of his tail sent a hot breeze across him.It was filled with acrid odors carried on the freshet of oxygen.As the worm sped southward, Leto allowed his mind to run free.He tried to think of this passage as a new ceremony for his life, one which kept him from considering the price he'd have to pay for his Golden Path.Like the Fremen of old, he knew he'd have to adopt many new ceremonies to keep his personality from dividing into its memory parts, to keep the ravening hunters of his soul forever at bay.Contradictory images, never to be unified, must now be encysted in a living tension, a polarizing force which drove him from within.Always newness, he thought.I must always find the new threads out of my vision.In the early afternoon his attention was caught by a protuberance ahead and slightly to the right of his course.Slowly the protuberance became a narrow butte, an upthrust rock precisely where he'd expected it.Now Namri...Now Sabiha, let us see how your brethren take to my presence, he thought.This was a most delicate thread ahead of him, dangerous more for its lures than its open threats.The butte was a long time changing dimensions.And it appeared for a while that it approached him instead of him approaching it.The worm, tiring now, kept veering left.Leto slid down the immense slope to set his hooks anew and keep the giant on a straight course.A soft sharpness of melange came to his nostrils, the signal of a rich vein.They passed the leprous blotches of violet sand where a spiceblow had erupted and he held the worm firmly until they were well past the vein.The breeze, redolent with the gingery odor of cinnamon, pursued them for a time until Leto rolled the worm onto its new course, headed directly toward the rising butte.Abruptly colors blinked far out on the southern bled: the unwary rainbow flashing of a man made artifact in that immensity.He brought up his binoculars, focused the oil lenses, and saw in the distance the outbanking wings of a spice scout glittering in the sunlight.Beneath it a big harvester was shedding its wings like a chrysalis before lumbering off.When Leto lowered the binoculars the harvester dwindled to a speck, and he felt himself overcome by the hadhdhab, the immense omnipresence of the desert, it told him how those spice hunters would see him, a dark object between desert and sky, which was the Fremen symbol for man.They'd see him, of course, and they'd be cautious.They'd wait.Fremen were always suspicious of one another in the desert until they recognized the newcomer or saw for certain that he posed no threat.Even within the fine patina of Imperial civilization and its sophisticated rules they remained half tamed savages, aware always that a crysknife dissolved at the death of its owner.That's what can save us, Leto thought.That wildness.In the distance the spice scout banked right, then left, a signal to the ground.He imagined the occupants scanning the desert behind him for sign that he might be more than a single rider on a single worm.Leto rolled the worm to the left, held it until it had reversed its course, dropped down the flank, and leaped clear.The worm, released from his goading, sulked on the surface for a few breaths, then sank its front third and lay there recuperating, a sure sign that it had been ridden too long.He turned away from the worm; it would stay there now.The scout was circling its crawler, still giving wing signals.They were smuggler paid renegades for certain, wary of electronic communications.The hunters would be on spice out there.That was the message of the crawler's presence.The scout circled once more, dipped its wings, came out of the circle and headed directly toward him.He recognized it for a type of light 'thopter his grandfather had introduced on Arrakis.The craft circled once above him, went out along the dune where he stood, and banked to land against the breeze.It came down within ten meters of him, stirring up a scattering of dust.The door on his side cracked enough to emit a single figure in a heavy Fremen robe with a spear symbol at the right breast.The Fremen approached slowly, giving each of them time to study the other.The man was tall with the total indigo of spice eyes.The stillsuit mask concealed the lower half of his face and the hood had been drawn down to protect his brows.The movement of the robe revealed a hand beneath it holding a maula pistol.The man stopped two paces from Leto, looked down at him with a puzzled crinkling around the eyes."Good fortune to us all," Leto said.The man peered all around, scanning the emptiness, then returned his attention to Leto."What do you here, child?"he demanded.His voice was muffled by the stillsuit mask."Are you trying to be the cork in a wormhole?"Again Leto used traditional Fremen formula: "The desert is my home. ""Wenn?"the man demanded.Which way do you go?"I travel south from Jacurutu. "An abrupt laugh erupted from the man."Well, Batigh!You are the strangest thing I've ever seen in the Tanzerouft. ""I'm not your Little Melon," Leto said, responding to Batigh.That was a label with dire overtones.The Little Melon on the desert's edge offered its water to any finder."We'll not drink you, Batigh," the man said."I am Muriz.I am the arifa of this taif. "He indicated with a head motion the distant spice crawler.Leto noted how the man called himself the Judge of his group and referred to the others as taif, a band or company.They were not ichwan, not a band of brothers.Paid renegades for sure.Here lay the thread he required.When Leto remained silent, Muriz asked: "Do you have a name?""Batigh will do. "A chuckle shook Muriz."You've not told me what you do here?""I seek the footprints of a worm," Leto said, using the religious phrase which said he was on hajj for his own umma, his personal revelation."One so young?"Muriz asked.He shook his head."I don't know what to do with you.You have seen us. ""What have I seen?"Leto asked."I speak of Jacurutu and you make no response. ""Riddle games," Muriz said."What is that, then?"He nodded toward the distant butte.Leto spoke from his vision: "Only Shuloch. "Muriz stiffened and Leto felt his own pulse quicken.A long silence ensued and Leto could see the man debating and discarding various responses.Shuloch!In the quiet story time after a sietch meal, stories of the Shuloch caravanserie were often repeated.Listeners always assumed that Shuloch was a myth, a place for interesting things to happen and only for the sake of the story.Leto recalled a Shuloch story: A waif was found at the desert's edge and brought into the sietch.At first the waif refused to respond to his saviors, then when he spoke no one could understand his words.As days passed he continued unresponsive, refused to dress himself or cooperate in any way.Every time he was left alone he made odd motions with his hands.All the specialists in the sietch were called in to study this waif but arrived at no answer.Then a very old woman passed the doorway, saw the moving hands, and laughed."He only imitates his father who rolls the spice fibers into rope," she explained."It's the way they still do it at Shuloch.He's just trying to feel less lonely. "And the moral: "In the old ways of Shuloch there is security and a sense of belonging to the golden thread of life".As Muriz remained silent, Leto said: "I'm the waif from Shuloch who knows only to move his hands. "In the quick movement of the man's head, Leto saw that Muriz knew the story.Muriz responded slowly, voice low and filled with menace."Are you human?""Human as yourself," Leto said."You speak most strangely for a child.I remind you that I am a judge who can respond to the taqwa. "Ah, yes, Leto thought.In the mouth of such a judge, the taqwa carried immediate threat.Taqwa was the fear invoked by the presence of a demon, a very real belief among older Fremen.The arifa knew the ways to slay a demon and was always chosen "because he has the wisdom to be ruthless without being cruel, to know when kindness is in fact the way to greater cruelty. "But this thing had come to the point which Leto sought, and he said: "I can submit to the Mashhad. ""I'll be the judge of any Spiritual Test," Muriz said."Do you accept this?""Bi lal kaifa," Leto said.Without qualification.A sly look came over Muriz's face.He said: "I don't know why I permit this.Best you were slain out of hand, but you're a small Batigh and I had a son who is dead.Come, we will go to Shuloch and I'll convene the Isnad for a decision about you. "Leto, noting how the man's every mannerism betrayed deadly decision, wondered how anyone could be fooled by this.He said: "I know Shuloch is the Ahl as sunna wal jamas. ""What does a child know of the real world?"Muriz asked, motioning for Leto to precede him to the 'thopter.Leto obeyed, but listened carefully to the sound of the Fremen's footsteps."The surest way to keep a secret is to make people believe they already know the answer," Leto said."People don't ask questions then.It was clever of you who were cast out of Jacurutu.Who'd believe Shuloch, the story myth place, is real?And how convenient for the smugglers or anyone else who desires access to Dune. "Muriz's footsteps stopped.Leto turned with his back against the 'thopter's side, the wing on his left.Muriz stood half a pace away with his maula pistol drawn and pointed directly at Leto."So you're not a child," Muriz said."A cursed midget come to spy on us!I thought you spoke too wisely for a child, but you spoke too much too soon. ""Not enough," Leto said."I'm Leto, the child of Paul Muad'Dib.If you slay me, you and your people will sink into the sand.If you spare me, I'll lead you to greatness. ""Don't play games with me, midget," Muriz snarled."Leto is at the real Jacurutu from whence you say... "He broke off.The gun hand dropped slightly as a puzzled frown made his eyes squint.It was the hesitation Leto had expected, He made every muscle indication of a move to the left which, deflecting his body no more than a millimeter, brought the Fremen's gun swinging wildly against the wing edge.The maula pistol flew from his hand and, before he could recover, Leto was beside him with Muriz's own crysknife pressed against the man's back."The tip's poisoned," Leto said."Tell your friend in the 'thopter that he's to remain exactly where he is without moving at all.Otherwise I'll be forced to kill you. "Muriz, nursing his injured hand, shook his head at the figure in the 'thopter, said: "My companion Behaleth has heard you.He will be as unmoving as the rock. "Knowing he had very little time until the two worked out a plan of action or their friends came to investigate, Leto spoke swiftly: "You need me, Muriz.Without me, the worms and their spice will vanish from Dune. "He felt the Fremen stiffen."But how do you know of Shuloch?"Muriz asked."I know they said nothing at Jacurutu. ""So you admit I'm Leto Atreides?""Who else could you be?But how do you  "  "Because you are here," Leto said."Shuloch exists, therefore the rest is utter simplicity.You are the Cast Out who escaped when Jacurutu was destroyed.I saw you signal with your wings, therefore you use no device which could be overheard at a distance.You collect spice, therefore you trade.You could only trade with the smugglers.You are a smuggler, yet you are Fremen.You must be of Shuloch. ""Why did you tempt me to slay you out of hand?""Because you would've slain me anyway when we'd returned to Shuloch. "A violent rigidity came over Muriz's body."Careful, Muriz," Leto cautioned."I know about you.It was in your history that you took the water of unwary travelers.By now this would be common ritual with you.How else could you silence the ones who chanced upon you?How else keep your secret?Batigh!You'd seduce me with gentle epithets and kindly words.Why waste any of my water upon the sand?And if I were missed as were many of the others   well, the Tanzerouft got me. "Muriz made the Horns of the Worm sign with his right hand to ward off the Rihani which Leto's words called up.And Leto, knowing how older Fremen distrusted mentats or anything which smacked of them by a show of extended logic, suppressed a smile."Manri spoke of us at Jacurutu," Muriz said."I will have his water when  "  "You'll have nothing but empty sand if you continue playing the fool," Leto said."What will you do, Muriz, when all of Dune has become green grass, trees, and open water?""It will never happen!""It is happening before your eves. "Leto heard Muriz's teeth grinding in rage and frustration.Presently the man grated: "How would you prevent this?""I know the entire plan of the transformation," Leto said."I know every weakness in it, every strength.Without me, Shai Hulud will vanish forever. "A sly note returning to his voice, Muriz asked: "Well, why dispute it here?We're at a standoff.You have your knife.You could kill me, but Behaleth would shoot you. ""Not before I recovered your pistol," Leto said."Then I'd have your 'thopter.Yes, I can fly it. "A scowl creased Muriz's forehead beneath the hood."What if you're not who you say?""Will my father not identify me?"Leto asked."Ahhhh," Muriz said."There's how you learned, eh?But... "He broke off, shook his head."My own son guides him.He says you two have never...How could... ""So you don't believe Muad'Dib reads the future," Leto said."Of course we believe!But he says of himself that... "Again Muriz broke off."And you thought him unaware of your distrust," Leto said."I came to this exact place in this exact time to meet you, Muriz.I know all about you because I've seen you...and your son.I know how secure you believe yourselves, how you sneer at Muad'Dib, how you plot to save your little patch of desert.But your little patch of desert is doomed without me, Muriz.Lost forever.It has gone too far here on Dune.My father has almost run out of vision, and you can only turn to me. ""That blind... "Muriz stopped, swallowed."He'll return soon from Arrakeen," Leto said, "and then we shall see how blind he is.How far have you gone from the old Fremen ways, Muriz?""What?""He is Wadquiyas with you.Your people found him alone in the desert and brought him to Shuloch.What a rich discovery he was!Richer than a spice vein.Wadquiyas!He has lived with you; his water mingled with your tribe's water.He's part of your Spirit River. "Leto pressed the knife hard against Muriz's robe."Careful, Muriz. "Leto lifted his left hand, released the Fremen's face flap, dropped it.Knowing what Leto planned, Muriz said: "Where would you go if you killed us both?""Back to Jacurutu. "Leto pressed the fleshy part of his own thumb against Muriz's mouth."Bite and drink, Muriz.That or die. "Muriz hesitated, then bit viciously into Leto's flesh.Leto watched the man's throat, saw the swallowing convulsion, withdrew the knife and returned it."Wadquiyas," Leto said."I must offend the tribe before you can take my water. "Muriz nodded."Your pistol is over there. "Leto gestured with his chin."You trust me now?"Muriz asked."How else can I live with the Cast Out?"Again Leto saw the sly look in Muriz's eyes, but this time it was a measuring thing, a weighing of economics.The man turned away with an abruptness which told of secret decisions, recovered his maula pistol and returned to the wing step."Come," he said."We tarry too long in a worm's lair. "= = = = = =   The future of prescience cannot always be locked into the rules of the past.The threads of existence tangle according to many unknown laws.Prescient future insists on its own rules.It will not conform to the ordering of the Zensunni nor to the ordering of science.Prescience builds a relative integrity.It demands the work of this instant, always warning that you cannot weave every thread into the fabric of the past.Kalima: The Words of Muad'Dib, The Shuloch Commentary   Muriz brought the ornithopter in over Shuloch with a practiced ease.Leto, seated beside him, felt the armed presence of Behaleth behind them.Everything went on trust now and the narrow thread of his vision to which he clung.If that failed, Allahu akbahr.Sometimes one had to submit to a greater order.The butte of Shuloch was impressive in this desert.Its unmarked presence here spoke of many bribes and many deaths, of many friends in high places.Leto could see at Shuloch's heart a cliff walled pan with interfringing blind canyons leading down into it.A thick growth of shadescale and salt bushes lined the lower edges of these canyons with an inner ring of fan palms, indicating the water riches of this place.Crude buildings of greenbush and spice fiber had been built out from the fan palms.The buildings were green buttons scattered on the sand.There would live the cast out of the Cast Out, those who could go no lower except into death.Muriz landed in the pan near the base of one of the canyons.A single structure stood on the sand directly ahead of the 'thopter: a thatch of desert vines and bejato leaves, all lined with heat fused spice fabric.It was the living replica of the first crude stilltents and it spoke of degradation for some who lived in Shuloch.Leto knew the place would leak moisture and would be full of night biters from the nearby growth.So this was how his father lived.And poor Sabiha.Here would be her punishment.At Muriz's order Leto let himself out of the 'thopter, jumped down to the sand, and strode toward the hut.He could see many people working farther toward the canyon among the palms.They looked tattered, poor, and the fact that they barely glanced at him or at the 'thopter said much of the oppression here.Leto could see the rock lip of a qanat beyond the workers, and there was no mistaking the sense of moisture in this air: open water.Passing the hut, Leto saw it was as crude as he'd expected.He pressed on to the qanat, peered down and saw the swirl of predator fish in the dark flow.The workers, avoiding his eyes, went on with clearing sand away from the line of rock openings.Muriz came up behind Leto, said: "You stand on the boundary between fish and worm.Each of these canyons has its worm.This qanat has been opened and we will remove the fish presently to attract sandtrout. ""Of course," Leto said."Holding pens.You sell sandtrout and worms off planet. ""It was Muad'Dib's suggestion!""I know.But none of your worms or sandtrout survive for long away from Dune. ""Not yet," Muriz said."But someday... ""Not in ten thousand years," Leto said.And he turned to watch the turmoil on Muriz's face.Questions flowed there like the water in the qanat.Could this son of Muad'Dib really read the future?Some still believed Muad'Dib had done it, but...How could a thing such as this be judged?Presently Muriz turned away, led them back to the hut.He opened the crude doorseal, motioned for Leto to enter.There was a spice oil lamp burning against the far wall and a small figure squatted beneath it, back to the door.The burning oil gave off a heavy fragrance of cinnamon."They've sent down a new captive to care for Muad'Dib's sietch," Muriz sneered."If she serves well, she may keep her water for a time."He confronted Leto."Some think it evil to take such water.Those lace shirt Fremen now make rubbish heaps in their new towns!Rubbish heaps!When has Dune ever before seen rubbish heaps!When we get such as this one  " He gestured toward the figure by the lamp.  "they're usually half wild with fear, lost to their own kind and never accepted by true Fremen.Do you understand me, Leto Batigh?""I understand you. "The crouching figure had not moved."You speak of leading us," Muriz said."Fremen are led by men who've been blooded.What could you lead us in?""Kralizec," Leto said, keeping his attention on the crouched figure.Muriz glared at him, brows contracted over his indigo eyes.Kralizec?That wasn't merely war or revolution; that was the Typhoon Struggle.It was a word from the furthermost Fremen legends: the battle at the end of the universe.Kralizec?The tall Fremen swallowed convulsively.This sprat was as unpredictable as a city dandy!Muriz turned to the squatting figure."Woman!Liban wahid!"he commanded.Bring us the spicedrink!"She hesitated."Do as he says, Sabiha," Leto said.She jumped to her feet, whirling.She stared at him, unable to take her gaze from his face."You know this one?"Muriz asked."She is Namri's niece.She offended Jacurutu and they have sent her to you. ""Namri?But... ""Liban wahid," Leto said.She rushed past them, tore herself through the doorseal and they heard the sound of her running feet."She will not go far," Muriz said.He touched a finger to the side of his nose."A kin of Namri, eh.Interesting.What did she do to offend?""She allowed me to escape. "Leto turned then and followed Sabiha.He found her standing at the edge of the qanat.Leto moved up beside her and looked down at the water.There were birds in the nearby fan palms and he heard their calls, their wings.The workers made scraping sounds as they moved sand.Still he did as Sabiha did, looking down, deep into the water and its reflections.The corners of his eyes saw blue parakeets in the palm fronds.One flew across the qanat and he saw it reflected in a silver swirl of fish, all run together as though birds and predators swam in the same firmament.Sabiha cleared her throat."You hate me," Leto said."You shamed me.You shamed me before my people.They held an Isnad and sent me here to lose my water.All because of you!"Muriz laughed from close behind them."And now you see, Leto Batigh, that our Spirit River has many tributaries. ""But my water flows in your veins," Leto said, turning."That is no tributary.Sabiha is the fate of my vision and I follow her.I fled across the desert to find my future here in Shuloch. ""You and... "He pointed at Sabiha, threw his head back in laughter."It will not be as either of you might believe," Leto said."Remember this, Muriz.I have found the footprints of my worm. "He felt tears swimming in his eyes then."He gives water to the dead," Sabiha whispered.Even Muriz stared at him in awe.Fremen never cried unless it was the most profound gift of the soul.Almost embarrassed, Muriz closed his mouthseal, pulled his djeballa hood low over his brows.Leto peered beyond the man, said: "Here in Shuloch they still pray for dew at the desert's edge.Go, Muriz, and pray for Kralizec.I promise you it will come. "= = = = = =   Fremen speech implies great concision, a precise sense of expression.It is immersed in the illusion of absolutes.Its assumptions are a fertile ground for absolutist religions.Furthermore, Fremen are fond of moralizing.They confront the terrifying instability of all things with institutionalized statements.They say: "We know there is no summa of all attainable knowledge; that is the preserve of God.But whatever men can learn, men can contain. "Out of this knife edged approach to the universe they carve a fantastic belief in signs and omens and in their own destiny.This is an origin of their Kralizec legend: the war at the end of the universe.Bene Gesserit Private Reports/folio 800881   "They have him securely in a safe place," Namri said, smiling across the square stone room at Gurney Halleck."You may report this to your friends. ""Where is this safe place?"Halleck asked.He didn't like Namri's tone, felt constrained by Jessica's orders.Damn the witch!Her explanations made no sense except the warning about what could happen if Leto failed to master his terrible memories."It's a safe place," Namri said."That's all I'm permitted to tell you. ""How do you know this?""I've had a distrans.Sabiha is with him. ""Sabiha!She'll just let him  "  "Not this time. ""Are you going to kill him?""That's no longer up to me. "Halleck grimaced.Distrans.What was the range of those damned cave bats?He'd often seen them flitting across the desert with hidden messages imprinted upon their squeaking calls.But how far would they go on this hellhole planet?"I must see him for myself," Halleck said."That's not permitted. "Halleck took a deep breath to quiet himself.He had spent two days and two nights waiting for search reports.Now it was another morning and he felt his role dissolving around him, leaving him naked.He had never liked command anyway.Command always waited while others did the interesting and dangerous things."Why isn't it permitted?"he asked.The smugglers who'd arranged this safe sietch had left too many questions unanswered and he wanted no more of the same from Namri."Some believe you saw too much when you saw this sietch," Namri said.Halleck heard the menace, relaxed into the easy stance of the trained fighter, hand near but not on his knife.He longed for a shield, but that had been ruled out by its effect on the worms, its short life in the presence of storm generated static charges."This secrecy isn't part of our agreement," Halleck said."If I'd killed him, would that have been part of our agreement?"Again Halleck felt the jockeying of unseen forces about which the Lady Jessica hadn't warned him.This damned plan of hers!Maybe it was right not to trust the Bene Gesserit.Immediately, he felt disloyal.She'd explained the problem, and he'd come into her plan with the expectation that it, like all plans, would need adjustments later.This wasn't any Bene Gesserit; this was Jessica of the Atreides who'd never been other than friend and supporter to him.Without her, he knew he'd have been adrift in a universe more dangerous than the one he now inhabited."You can't answer my question," Namri said."You were to kill him only if he showed himself to be...possessed," Halleck said."Abomination. "Namri put his fist beside his right ear."Your Lady knew we had tests for such.Wise of her to leave that judgment in my hands. "Halleck compressed his lips in frustration."You heard the Reverend Mother's words to me," Namri said."We Fremen understand such women but you off worlders never understand them.Fremen women often send their sons to death. "Halleck spoke past still lips."Are you telling me you've killed him?""He lives.He is in a safe place.He'll continue to receive the spice. ""But I'm to escort him back to his grandmother if he survives," Halleck said.Namri merely shrugged.Halleck understood that this was all the answer he'd get.Damn!He couldn't go back to Jessica with such unanswered questions!He shook his head."Why question what you cannot change?"Namri asked."You're being well paid. "Halleck scowled at the man.Fremen!They believed all foreigners were influenced primarily by money.But Namri was speaking more than Fremen prejudice.Other forces were at work here and that was obvious to one who'd been trained in observation by a Bene Gesserit.This whole thing had the smell of a feint within a feint within a feint...Shifting to the insultingly familiar form, Halleck said: "The Lady Jessica will be wrathful.She could send cohorts against  "  "Zanadiq!"Namri cursed."You office messenger!You stand outside the Mohalata!I take pleasure in possessing your water for the Noble People!"Halleck rested a hand on his knife, readied his left sleeve where he'd prepared a small surprise for attackers."I see no water spilled here," he said."Perhaps you're blinded by your pride. ""You live because I wished you to learn before dying that your Lady Jessica will not send cohorts against anyone.You are not to be lured quietly into the Huanui, off world scum.I am of the Noble People, and you  "  "And I'm just a servant of the Atreides," Halleck said, voice mild."We're the scum who lifted the Harkonnen yoke from your smelly neck. "Namri showed white teeth in a grimace."Your Lady is prisoner on Salusa Secundus.The notes you thought were from her came from her daughter!"By extreme effort, Halleck managed to keep his voice even."No matter.Alia will... "Namri drew his crysknife."What do you know of the Womb of Heaven?I am her servant, you male whore.I do her bidding when I take your water!"And he lunged across the room with foolhardy directness.Halleck, not allowing himself to be tricked by such seeming clumsiness, flicked up the left arm of his robe, releasing the extra length of heavy fabric he'd had sewn there, letting that take Namri's knife.In the same movement, Halleck swept the folds of cloth over Namri's head, came in under and through the cloth with his own knife aimed directly for the face.He felt the point bite home as Namri's body hit him with a hard surface of metal armor beneath the robe.The Fremen emitted one outraged squeal, jerked backward, and fell.He lay there, blood gushing from his mouth as his eyes glared at Halleck then slowly dulled.Halleck blew air through his lips.How could that fool Namri have expected anyone to miss the presence of armor beneath a robe?Halleck addressed the corpse as he recovered the trick sleeve, wiped his knife and sheathed it."How did you think we Atreides servants were trained, fool?"He took a deep breath thinking: Well now.Whose feint am I?There'd been the ring of truth in Namri's words.Jessica a prisoner of the Corrinos and Alia working her own devious schemes.Jessica herself had warned of many contingencies with Alia as enemy, but had not predicted herself as prisoner.He had his orders to obey, though.First there was the necessity of getting away from this place.Luckily one robed Fremen looked much like another.He rolled Namri's body into a corner, threw cushions over it, moved a rug to cover the blood.When it was done, Halleck adjusted the nose and mouth tubes of his stillsuit, brought up the mask as one would in preparing for the desert, pulled the hood of his robe forward and went out into the long passage.The innocent move without care, he thought, setting his pace at an easy saunter.He felt curiously free, as though he'd moved out of danger, not into it.I never did like her plan for the boy, he thought.And I'll tell her so if I see her.If.Because if Namri spoke the truth, the most dangerous alternate plan went into effect.Alia wouldn't let him live long if she caught him, but there was always Stilgar   a good Fremen with a good Fremen's superstitions.Jessica had explained it: "There's a very thin layer of civilized behavior over Stilgar's original nature.And here's how you take that layer off him... "= = = = = =   The spirit of Muad'Dib is more than words, more than the letter of the Law which arises in his name.Muad'Dib must always be that inner outrage against the complacently powerful, against the charlatans and the dogmatic fanatics.It is that inner outrage which must have its say because Muad'Dib taught us one thing above all others: that humans can endure only in a fraternity of social justice.The Fedaykin Compact   Leto sat with his back against the wall of the hut, his attention on Sabiha, watching the threads of his vision unroll.She had prepared the coffee and set it aside.Now she squatted across from him stirring his evening meal.It was a gruel redolent with melange.Her hands moved quickly with the ladle and liquid indigo stained the sides of his bowl.She bent her thin face over the bowl, blending in the concentrate.The crude membrane which made a stilltent of the hut had been patched with lighter material directly behind her, and this formed a grey halo against which her shadow danced in the flickering light of the cooking flame and the single lamp.That lamp intrigued Leto.These people of Shuloch were profligate with spice oil: a lamp, not a glowglobe.They kept slave outcasts within their walls in the fashion told by the most ancient Fremen traditions.Yet they employed ornithopters and the latest spice harvesters.They were a crude mixture of ancient and modern.Sabiha pushed the bowl of gruel toward him, extinguished the cooking flame.Leto ignored the bowl."I will be punished if you do not eat this," she said.He stared at her, thinking: If I kill her, that'll shatter one vision.If I tell her Muriz's plans, that'll shatter another vision.If I wait here for my father, this vision thread will become a mighty rope.His mind sorted the threads.Some held a sweetness which haunted him.One future with Sabiha carried alluring reality within his prescient awareness.It threatened to block out all others until he followed it out to its ending agonies."Why do you stare at me that way?"she asked.Still he did not answer.She pushed the bowl closer to him.Leto tried to swallow in a dry throat.The impulse to kill Sabiha welled in him.He found himself trembling with it.How easy it would be to shatter one vision and let the wildness run free!"Muriz commands this," she said, touching the bowls.Yes, Muriz commanded it.Superstition conquered everything.Muriz wanted a vision cast for him to read.He was an ancient savage asking the witch doctor to throw the ox bones and interpret their sprawl.Muriz had taken his captive's stillsuit "as a simple precaution. "There'd been a sly jibe at Namri and Sabiha in that comment.Only fools let a prisoner escape.Muriz had a deep emotional problem, though: the Spirit River.The captive's water flowed in Muriz's veins.Muriz sought a sign that would permit him to hold a threat of death over Leto.Like father, like son, Leto thought."The spice will only give you visions," Sabiha said.The long silences made her uneasy."I've had visions in the orgy many times.They don't mean anything. "That's it!he thought, his body locking itself into a stillness which left his skin cold and clammy.The Bene Gesserit training took over his consciousness, a pinpoint illumination which fanned out beyond him to throw the blazoning light of vision upon Sabiha and all of her Cast Out fellows.The ancient Bene Gesserit learning was explicit:  "Languages build up to reflect specializations in a way of life.Each specialization may be recognized by its words, by its assumptions and sentence structures.Look for stoppages.Specializations represent places where life is being stopped, where the movement is dammed up and frozen. "He saw Sabiha then as a vision maker in her own right, and every other human carried the same power.Yet she was disdainful of her spice orgy visions.They caused disquiet and, therefore, must be put aside, forgotten deliberately.Her people prayed to Shai Hulud because the worm dominated many of their visions.They prayed for dew at the desert's edge because moisture limited their lives.Yet they wallowed in spice wealth and lured sandtrout to open qanats.Sabiha fed him prescient visions with a casual callousness, yet within her words he saw the illuminated signals: she depended upon absolutes, sought finite limits, and all because she couldn't handle the rigors of terrible decisions which touched her own flesh.She clung to her one eyed vision of the universe, englobing and time freezing as it might be, because the alternatives terrified her.In contrast, Leto felt the pure movement of himself.He was a membrane collecting infinite dimensions and, because he saw those dimensions, he could make the terrible decisions.As my father did."You must eat this!"Sabiha said, her voice petulant.Leto saw the whole pattern of the visions now and knew the thread he must follow.My skin is not my own.He stood, pulling his robe around him.It felt strange against his flesh with no stillsuit protecting his body.His feet were bare upon the fused spice fabric of the floor, feeling the sand tracked in there."What're you doing?"Sabiha demanded."The air is bad in here.I'm going outside. ""You can't escape," she said."Every canyon has its worm.If you go beyond the qanat, the worms will sense you by your moisture.These captive worms are very alert   not like the ones in the desert at all.Besides  " how gloating her voice became! "you've no stillsuit. ""Then why do you worry?"he asked, wondering if he might yet provoke a real reaction from her."Because you've not eaten. ""And you'll be punished. "
