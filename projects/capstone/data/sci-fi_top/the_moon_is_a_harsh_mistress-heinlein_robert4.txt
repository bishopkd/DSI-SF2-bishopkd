"Okay, we'll get to it later.Now back up and go over this stuff slowly  and, Mike, as you read out, store again, without erasing, under Bastille Day and tag it 'Fink File. 'Okay?""Programmed and running. ""Do that with anything new he puts in, too. "Prime prize was list of names by warrens, some two hundred, each keyed with a code Mike identified with those blind pay accounts.Mike read out Hong Kong Luna list and was hardly started when Wyoh gasped, "Stop, Mike!I've got to write these down!"I said, "Hey!No writing!What's huhu?""That woman, Sylvia Chiang, is comrade secretary back home!But   But that means the Warden has our whole organization!""No, dear Wyoming," Prof corrected."It means we have his organization. ""But  "  "I see what Prof means," I told her."Our organization is just us three and Mike.Which Warden doesn't know.But now we know his organization.So shush and let Mike read.But don't write; you have this list  from Mike  anytime you phone him.Mike, note that Chiang woman is organization secretary, former organization, in Kongville. ""Noted. "Wyoh boiled over as she heard names of undercover finks in her town but limited herself to noting facts about ones she knew.Not all were "comrades" but enough that she stayed riled up.Novy Leningrad names didn't mean much to us; Prof recognized three, Wyoh one.When came Luna City Prof noted over half as being "comrades. "I recognized several, not as fake subversives but as acquaintances.Not friends   Don't know what it would do to me to find someone I trusted on boss fink's payroll.But would shake me.It shook Wyoh.When Mike finished she said, "I've got to get home!Never in my life have I helped eliminate anyone but I am going to enjoy putting the black on these spies!"Prof said quietly, "No one will be eliminated, dear Wyoming. ""What?Professor, can't you take it?Though I've never killed anyone, I've always known it might have to be done. "He shook head."Killing is not the way to handle a spy, not when he doesn't know that you know that he is a spy. "She blinked."I must be dense. ""No, dear lady.Instead you have a charming honesty....weakness you must guard against.The thing to do with a spy is to let him breathe, encyst him with loyal comrades, and feed him harmless information to please his employers.These creatures will be taken into our organization.Don't be shocked; they will be in very special cells.'Cages' is a better word.But it would be the greatest waste to eliminate them  not only would each spy be replaced with someone new but also killing these traitors would tell the Warden that we have penetrated his secrets.Mike amigo mio, there should be in that file a dossier on me.Will you see?"Were long notes on Prof, and I was embarrassed as they added up to "harmless old fool. "He was tagged as a subversive  that was why he had been sent to The Rock  as a member of underground group in Luna City.But was described as a "troublemaker" in organization, one who rarely agreed with others.Prof dimpled and looked pleased."I must consider trying to sell out and get myself placed on the Warden's payroll. "Wyoh did not think this funny, especially when he made clear was not joke, merely unsure tactic was practical."Revolutions must be financed, dear lady, and one way is for a revolutionary to become a police spy.It is probable that some of those prima facie traitors are actually on our side. ""I wouldn't trust them!""Ah, yes, that is the rub with double agents, to be certain where their loyalties  if any  lie.Do you wish your own dossier?Or would you rather hear it in private?"Wyoh's record showed no surprises.Warden's finks had tabbed her years back.But I was surprised that I had a record, too  routine check made when I was cleared to work in Authority Complex.Was classed as "non political" and someone had added "not too bright" which was both unkind and true or why would I get mixed up in Revolution?Prof had Mike stop read out (hours more), leaned back and looked thoughtful."One thing is clear," he said."The Warden knew plenty about Wyoming and myself long ago.But you, Manuel, are not on his black list. ""After last night?""Ah, so.Mike, do you have anything In that file entered in the last twenty four hours?"Nothing.Prof said, "Wyoming is right that we cannot stay here forever.Manuel, how many names did you recognize?Six, was it?Did you see any of them last night?""No.But might have seen me. ""More likely they missed you in the crowd.I did not spot you until I came down front and I've known you since you were a boy.But it is most unlikely that Wyoming traveled from Hong Kong and spoke at the meeting without her activity being known to the Warden. "He looked at Wyoh."Dear lady, could you bring yourself to play the nominal role of an old man's folly?""I suppose so.How, Professor?""Manuel is probably in the clear.I am not but from my dossier it seems unlikely that the Authority's finks will bother to pick me up.You they may wish to question or even to hold; you are rated as dangerous.It would be wise for you to stay out of sight.This room   I'm thinking of renting it for a period  weeks or even years.You could hide in it  if you do not mind the obvious construction that would be placed on your staying here. "Wyoh chuckled."Why, you darling!Do you think I care what anyone thinks?I'd be delighted to play the role of your bundle baby  and don't be too sure I'd be just playing. ""Never tease an old dog," he said mildly."He might still have one bite.I may occupy that couch most nights.Manuel, I intend to resume my usual ways  and so should you.While I feel that it will take a busy cossack to arrest me, I will sleep sounder in this hideaway.But in addition to being a hideout this room is good for cell meetings; it has a phone. "Mike said, "Professor, may I offer a suggestion?""Certainly, amigo, we want your thoughts. ""I conclude that the hazards increase with each meeting of our executive cell.But meetings need not be corporal; you can meet  and I can join you if I am welcome  by phone. ""You are always welcome, Comrade Mike; we need you.However  " Prof looked worried.I said, "Prof, don't worry about anybody listening in. "I explained how to place a "Sherlock" call."Phones are safe if Mike supervises call.Reminds me   You haven't been told how to reach Mike.How, Mike?Prof use my number?"Between them, they settled on MYSTERIOUS.Prof and Mike shared childlike joy in intrigue for own sake.I suspect Prof enjoyed being rebel long before he worked out his political philosophy, while Mike  how could human freedom matter to him?Revolution was a game  a game that gave him companionship and chance to show off talents.Mike was as conceited a machine as you are ever likely to meet."But we still need this room," Prof said, reached into pouch, hauled out thick wad of bills.I blinked."Prof, robbed a bank?""Not recently.Perhaps again in the future of the Cause requires it.A rental period of one lunar should do as a starter.Will you arrange it, Manuel?The management might be surprised to hear my voice; I came in through a delivery door. "I called manager, bargained for dated key, four weeks.He asked nine hundred Hong Kong.I offered nine hundred Authority.He wanted to know how many would use room?I asked if was policy of Raffles to snoop affairs of guests?We settled at HK$475; I sent up bills, he sent down two dated keys.I gave one to Wyoh, one to Prof, kept one day key, knowing they would not reset lock unless we failed to pay at end of lunar.(Earthside I ran into insolent practice of requiring hotel guest to sign chop  even show identification!)I asked, "What next?Food?""I'm not hungry, Mannie. ""Manuel, you asked us to wait while Mike settled your questions.Let's get back to the basic problem: how we are to cope when we find ourselves facing Terra, David facing Goliath. ""Oh.Been hoping that would go away.Mike?You really have ideas?""I said I did, Man," he answered plaintively."We can throw rocks. ""Bog's sake!No time for jokes. ""But, Man," he protested, "we can throw rocks at Terra.We will. "8   Took time to get through my skull that Mike was serious, and scheme might work.Then took longer to show Wyoh and Prof how second part was true.Yet both parts should have been obvious.Mike reasoned so: What is "war"?One book defined war as use of force to achieve political result.And "force" is action of one body on another applied by means of energy.In war this is done by "weapons"  Luna had none.But weapons, when Mike examined them as class, turned out to be engines for manipulating energy  and energy Luna has plenty.Solar flux alone is good for around one kilowatt per square meter of surface at Lunar noon; sunpower, though cyclic, is effectively unlimited.Hydrogen fusion power is almost as unlimited and cheaper, once ice is mined, magnetic pinchbottle set up.Luna has energy  how to use?But Luna also has energy of position; she sits at top of gravity well eleven kilometers per second deep and kept from falling in by curb only two and a half km/s high.Mike knew that curb; daily he tossed grain freighters over it, let them slide downhill to Terra.Mike had computed what would happen if a freighter grossing 100 tonnes (or same mass of rock) falls to Terra, unbraked.Kinetic energy as it hits is 6.25 x 10^12 joules  over six trillion joules.This converts in split second to heat.Explosion, big one!Should have been obvious.Look at Luna: What you see?Thousands on thousands of craters  places where Somebody got playful throwing rocks.Wyoh said, "Joules don't mean much to me.How does that compare with H bombs?""Uh  " I started to round off in head.Mike's "head" works faster; he answered, "The concussion of a hundred tonne mass on Terra approaches the yield of a two kilotonne atomic bomb. ""'Kilo' is a thousand," Wyoh murmured, "and 'mega' is a million   Why, that's only one fifty thousandth as much as a hundred megatonne bomb.Wasn't that the size Sovunion used?""Wyoh, honey," I said gently, "that's not how it works.Turn it around.A two kilotonne yield is equivalent to exploding two million kilograms of trinitrotoluol...and a kilo of TNT is quite an explosion   Ask any drillman.Two million kilos will wipe out good sized town.Check, Mike?""Yes, Man.But, Wyoh my only female friend, there is another aspect.Multi megatonne fusion bombs are inefficient.The explosion takes place in too small a space; most of it is wasted.While a hundred megatonne bomb is rated as having fifty thousand times the yield of a two kilotonne bomb, its destructive effect is only about thirteen hundred times as great as that of a two kilotonne explosion. ""But it seems to me that thirteen hundred times is still quite a lot  if they are going to use bombs on us that much bigger. ""True, Wyoh my female friend...but Luna has many rocks. ""Oh.Yes, so we have. ""Comrades," said Prof, "this is outside my competence  in my younger or bomb throwing days my experience was limited to something of the order of the one kilogram chemical explosion of which you spoke, Manuel.But I assume that you two know what you are talking about. ""We do," Mike agreed."So I accept your figures.To bring it down to a scale that I can understand this plan requires that we capture the catapult.No?""Yes," Mike and I chorused."Not impossible.Then we must hold it and keep it operative.Mike, have you considered how your catapult can be protected against, let us say, one small H tipped torpedo?"Discussion went on and on.We stopped to eat  stopped business under Prof's rule.Instead Mike told jokes, each produced a that reminds me from Prof.By time we left Raffles Hotel evening of 14th May '75 we had  Mike had, with help from Prof  outlined plan of Revolution, including major options at critical points.When came time to go, me to home and Prof to evening class (if not arrested), then home for bath and clothes and necessities in case he returned that night, became clear Wyoh did not want to be alone in strange hotel  Wyoh was stout when bets were down, between times soft and vulnerable.So I called Mum on a Sherlock and told her was bringing house guest home.Mum ran her job with style; any spouse could bring guest home for meal or year, and our second generation was almost as free but must ask.Don't know how other families work; we have customs firmed by a century; they suit us.So Mum didn't ask name, age, sex, marital condition; was my right and she too proud to ask.All she said was: "That's nice, dear.Have you two had dinner?It's Tuesday, you know. ""Tuesday" was to remind me that our family had eaten early because Greg preaches Tuesday evenings.But if guest had not eaten, dinner would be served  concession to guest, not to me, as with exception of Grandpaw we ate when was on table or scrounged standing up in pantry.I assured her we had eaten and would make tall effort to be there before she needed to leave.Despite Loonie mixture of Muslims, Jews, Christians, Buddhists, and ninety nine other flavors, I suppose Sunday is commonest day for church.But Greg belongs to sect which had calculated that sundown Tuesday to sundown Wednesday, local time Garden of Eden (zone minus two, Terra) was the Sabbath.So we ate early in Terran north hemisphere summer months.Mum always went to hear Greg preach, so was not considerate to place duty on her that would clash.All of us went occasionally; I managed several times a year because terribly fond of Greg, who taught me one trade and helped me switch to another when I had to and would gladly have made it his arm rather than mine.But Mum always went  ritual not religion, for she admitted to me one night in pillow talk that she had no religion with a brand on it, then cautioned me not to tell Greg.I exacted same caution from her.I don't know Who is cranking; I'm pleased He doesn't stop.But Greg was Mum's "boy husband," opted when she was very young, first wedding after her own  very sentimental about him, would deny fiercely if accused of loving him more than other husbands, yet took his faith when he was ordained and never missed a Tuesday.She said, "Is it possible that your guest would wish to attend church?"I said would see but anyhow we would rush, and said goodbye.Then banged on bathroom door and said, "Hurry with skin, Wyoh; we're short on minutes. ""One minute!"she called out.She's ungirlish girl; she appeared in one minute."How do I look?"she asked."Prof, will I pass?""Dear Wyoming, I am amazed.You were beautiful before, you are beautiful now  but utterly unrecognizable.You're safe  and I am relieved. "Then we waited for Prof to transform into old derelict; he would be it to his back corridor, then reappear as well known teacher in front of class, to have witnesses in case a yellow boy was waiting to grab him.It left a moment; I told Wyoh about Greg.She said, "Mannie, how good is this makeup?Would it pass in church?How bright are the lights?""No brighter than here.Good job, you'll get by.But do you want to go to church?Nobody pushing. "She thought."It would please your moth  I mean, 'your senior wife,' would it not?"I answered slowly, "Wyoh, religion is your pidgin.But since you ask...yes, nothing would start you better in Davis Family than going to church with Mum.I'll go if you do. ""I'll go.I thought your last name was 'O'Kelly'?""Is.Tack 'Davis' on with hyphen if want to be formal.Davis is First Husband, dead fifty years.Is family name and all our wives are 'Gospazha Davis' hyphened with every male name in Davis line plus her family name.In practice Mum is only 'Gospazha Davis'  can call her that  and others use first name and add Davis if they write a cheque or something.Except that Ludmilla is 'Davis Davis' because proud of double membership, birth and option. ""I see.Then if a man is 'John Davis,' he's a son, but if he has some other last name he's your co husband.But a girl would be 'Jenny Davis' either way, wouldn't she?How do I tell?By her age?No, that wouldn't help.I'm confused!And I thought clan marriages were complex.Or polyandries  though mine wasn't; at least my husbands had the same last name. ""No trouble.When you hear a woman about forty address a fifteen year old as 'Mama Milla," you'll know which is wife and which is daughter  not even that complex as we don't have daughters home past husband high; they get opted.But might be visiting.Your husbands were named 'Knott'?""Oh, no, 'Fedoseev, Choy Lin and Choy Mu. 'I took back my born name. "Out came Prof, cackled senilely (looked even worse than earlier!), we left by three exits, made rendezvous in main corridor, open formation.Wyoh and I did not walk together, as I might be nabbed; on other hand she did not know Luna City, a warren so complex even nativeborn get lost  so I led and she had to keep me in sight.Prof trailed to make sure she didn't lose me.If I was picked up, Wyoh would find public phone, report to Mike, then return to hotel and wait for Prof.But I felt sure that any yellow jacket who arrested me would get a caress from number seven arm.No huhu.Up to level five and crosstown by Carver Causeway, up to level three and stop at Tube Station West to pick up arms and tool kit  but not p suit; would not have been in character, I stored it there.One yellow uniform at station, showed no interest in me.South by well lighted corridors until necessary to go outward to reach private easement lock thirteen to co op pressure tunnel serving Davis Tunnels and a dozen other farms.I suppose Prof dropped off there but I never looked back.I delayed locking through our door until Wyoh caught up, then soon was saying, "Mum, allow me to present Wyma Beth Johnson. "Mum took her in arms, kissed cheek, said, "So glad you could come, Wyma dear!Our house is yours!"See why I love our old biddy?Could have quick frosted Wyoh with same words  but was real and Wyoh knew.Hadn't warned Wyoh about switch in names, thought of it en route.Some of our kids were small and while they grew up despising Warden, no sense in risking prattle about "Wyoming Knott, who's visiting us"  that name was listed in "Special File Zebra. "So I missed warning her, was new to conspiracy.But Wyoh caught cue and never bobbled.Greg was in preaching clothes and would have to leave in minutes.Mum did not hurry, took Wyoh down line of husbands  Grandpaw, Greg, Hans  then up line of wives  Ludmilla, Lenore, Sidris, Anna  with stately grace, then started on our kids.I said, "Mum?Excuse me, want to change arms. "Her eyebrows went up a millimeter, meaning: "We'll speak of this but not in front of children"  so I added: "Know it's late, Greg's sneaking look at watch.And Wyma and I are going to church.So 'scuse, please. "She relaxed."Certainly, dear. "As she turned away I saw her arm go around Wyoh's waist, so I relaxed.I changed arms, replacing number seven with social arm.But was excuse to duck into phone cupboard and punch "MYCROFTXXX. ""Mike, we're home.But about to go to church.Don't think you can listen there, so I'll check in later.Heard from Prof?""Not yet, Man.Which church is it?I may have some circuit. ""Pillar of Fire Repentance Tabernacle  "  "No reference. ""Slow to my speed, pal.Meets in West Three Community Hall.That's south of Station on Ring about number  . ""I have it.There's a pickup inside for channels and a phone in the corridor outside; I'll keep an ear on both. ""I don't expect trouble, Mike. ""It's what Professor said to do.He is reporting now.Do you wish to speak to him?""No time.'Bye!"That set pattern: Always keep touch with Mike, let him know where you are, where you plan to be; Mike would listen if he had nerve ends there.Discovery I made that morning, that Mike could listen at dead phone, suggested it  discovery bothered me; don't believe in magic.But on thinking I realized a phone could be switched on by central switching system without human intervention  if switching system had volition.Mike had bolshoyeh volition.How Mike knew a phone was outside that hall is hard to say, since "space" could not mean to him what means to us.But he carried in storage a "map"  structured relations  of Luna City's engineering, and could almost always fit what we said to what he knew as "Luna City"; hardly ever got lost.So from day cabal started we kept touch with Mike and each other through his widespread nervous system.Won't mention again unless necessary.Mum and Greg and Wyoh were waiting at outer door, Mum chomping but smiling.I saw she had lent Wyoh a stole; Mum was as easy about skin as any Loonie, nothing newchummish  but church was another matter.We made it, although Greg went straight to platform and we to seats.I settled in warm, mindless state, going through motions.But Wyoh did really listen to Greg's sermon and either knew our hymn book or was accomplished sight reader.When we got home, young ones were in bed and most adults; Hans and Sidris were up and Sidris served cocoasoy and cookies, then all turned in.Mum assigned Wyoh a room in tunnel most of our kids lived in, one which had had two smaller boys last time I noticed.Did not ask how she had reshuffled, was clear she was giving my guest best we had, or would have put Wyoh with one of older girls.I slept with Mum that night, partly because our senior wife is good for nerves  and nerve racking things had happened  and partly so she would know I was not sneaking to Wyoh's room after things were quiet.My workshop, where I slept when slept alone; was just one bend from Wyoh's door.Mum was telling me, plain as print: "Go ahead, dear.Don't tell me if you wish to be mean about it.Sneak behind my back. "Which neither of us admitted.We visited as we got ready for bed, chatted after light out, then I turned over.Instead of saying goodnight Mum said, "Manuel?Why does your sweet little guest make herself up as an Afro?I would think that her natural coloration would be more becoming.Not that she isn't perfectly charming the way she chooses to be. "So rolled over and faced her, and explained  sounded thin, so filled in.And found self telling all  except one point: Mike.I included Mike  but not as computer  instead as a man Mum was not likely to meet, for security reasons.But telling Mum  taking her into my subcell, should say, to become leader of own cell in turn  taking Mum into conspiracy was not case of husband who can't keep from blurting everything to his wife.At most was hasty  but was best time if she was to be told.Mum was smart.Also able executive; running big family without baring teeth requires that.Was respected among farm families and throughout Luna City; she had been up longer than 90 percent.She could help.And would be indispensable inside family.Without her help Wyoh and I would find it sticky to use phone together (hard to explain), keep kids from noticing (impossible!)but with Mum's help would be no problems inside household.She listened, sighed, said, "It sounds dangerous, dear. ""Is," I said."Look, Mimi, if you don't want to tackle, say so then forget what I've told. ""Manuel!Don't even say that.You are my husband, dear; I took you for better, for worse...and your wish is my command. "(My word, what a lie!But Mimi believed it. )"I would not let you go into danger alone," she went on, "and besides  "  "What, Mimi?""I think every Loonie dreams of the day when we will be free.All but some poor spineless rats.I've never talked about it; there seemed to be no point and it's necessary to look up, not down, lift one's burden and go ahead.But I thank dear Bog that I have been permitted to live to see the time come, if indeed it has.Explain more about it.I am to find three others, is it?Three who can be trusted. ""Don't hurry.Move slowly.Be sure. ""Sidris can be trusted.She holds her tongue, that one. ""Don't think you should pick from family.Need to spread out.Don't rush. ""I shan't.We'll talk before I do anything.And Manuel, if you want my opinion  " She stopped."Always want your opinion, Mimi. ""Don't mention this to Grandpaw.He's forgetful these days and sometimes talkative.Now sleep, dear, and don't dream. "9   Followed a long time during which would have been possible to forget anything as unlikely as revolution had not details taken so much time.Our first purpose was not to be noticed.Long distance purpose was to make things as much worse as possible.Yes, worse.Never was a time, even at last, when all Loonies wanted to throw off Authority, wanted it bad enough to revolt.All Loonies despised Warden and cheated Authority.Didn't mean they were ready to fight and die.If you had mentioned "patriotism" to a Loonie, he would have stared  or thought you were talking about his homeland.Were transported Frenchmen whose hearts belonged to "La Belle Patrie," ex Germans loyal to Vaterland, Russkis who still loved Holy Mother Russia.But Luna?Luna was "The Rock," place of exile, not thing to love.We were as non political a people as history ever produced.I know, I was as numb to politics as any until circumstances pitched me into it.Wyoming was in it because she hated Authority for a personal reason, Prof because he despised all authority in a detached intellectual fashion, Mike because he was a bored and lonely machine and was for him "only game in town. "You could not have accused us of patriotism.I came closest because I was third generation with total lack of affection for any place on Terra, had been there, disliked it and despised earthworms.Made me more "patriotic" than most!Average Loonie was interested in beer, betting, women, and work, in that order."Women" might be second place but first was unlikely, much as women were cherished.Loonies had learned there never were enough women to go around.Slow learners died, as even most possessive male can't stay alert every minute.As Prof says, a society adapts to fact, or doesn't survive.Loonies adapted to harsh facts  or failed and died.But "patriotism" was not necessary to survival.Like old Chinee saying that "Fish aren't aware of water," I was not aware of any of this until I first went to Terra and even then did not realize what a blank spot was in Loonies under storage location marked "patriotism" until I took part in effort to stir them up.Wyoh and her comrades had tried to push "patriotism" button and got nowhere  years of work, a few thousand members, less than 1 percent and of that microscopic number almost 10 percent had been paid spies of boss fink!Prof set us straight: Easier to get people to hate than to get them to love.Luckily, Security Chief Alvarez gave us a hand.Those nine dead finks were replaced with ninety, for Authority was goaded into something it did reluctantly, namely spend money on us, and one folly led to another.Warden's bodyguard had never been large even in earliest days Prison guards in historical meaning were unnecessary and that had been one attraction of penal colony system  cheap.Warden and his deputy had to be protected and visiting vips, but prison itself needed no guards.They even stopped guarding ships after became clear was not necessary, and in May 2075, bodyguard was down to its cheapest numbers, all of them new chum transportees.But loss of nine in one night scared somebody.We knew it scared Alvarez; he filed copies of his demands for help in Zebra file and Mike read them.A lag who had been a police officer on Terra before his conviction and then a bodyguard all his years in Luna, Alvarez was probably most frightened and loneliest man in The Rock.He demanded more and tougher help, threatened to resign civil service job if he didn't get it   just a threat, which Authority would have known if it had really known Luna.If Alvarez had showed up in any warren as unarmed civilian, he would have stayed breathing only as long as not recognized.He got his additional guards.We never found out who ordered that raid.Mort the Wart had never shown such tendencies, had been King Log throughout tenure.Perhaps Alvarez, having only recently succeeded to boss fink spot, wanted to make face  may have had ambition to be Warden.But likeliest theory is that Warden's reports on "subversive activities" caused Authority Earthside to order a cleanup.One thumb fingered mistake led to another.New bodyguards, instead of picked from new transportees, were elite convict troops, Federated Nations crack Peace Dragoons.Were mean and tough, did not want to go to Luna, and soon realized that "temporary police duty" was one way trip.Hated Luna and Loonies, and saw us as cause of it all.Once Alvarez got them, he posted a twenty four hour watch at every interwarren tube station and instituted passports and passport control.Would have been illegal had there been laws in Luna, since 95 percent of us were theoretically free, either born free, or sentence completed.Percentage was higher in cities as undischarged transportees lived in barrack warrens at Complex and came into town only two days per lunar they had off work.If then, as they had no money, but you sometimes saw them wandering around, hoping somebody would buy a drink.But passport system was not "illegal" as Warden's regulations were only written law.Was announced in papers, we were given week to get passports, and at eight hundred one morning was put in effect.Some Loonies hardly ever traveled; some traveled on business; some commuted from outlying warrens or even from Luna City to Novylen or other way.Good little boys filled out applications, paid fees, were photographed, got passes; I was good little boy on Prof's advice, paid for passport and added it to pass I carried to work in Complex.Few good little boys!Loonies did not believe it.Passports?Whoever heard of such a thing?Was a trooper at Tube Station South that morning dressed in bodyguard yellow rather than regimentals and looking like he hated it, and us.I was not going anywhere; I hung back and watched.Novylen capsule was announced; crowd of thirty odd headed for gate.Gospodin Yellow Jacket demanded passport of first to reach it.Loonie stopped to argue.Second one pushed past; guard turned and yelled  three or four more shoved past.Guard reached for sidearm; somebody grabbed his elbow, gun went off  not a laser, a slug gun, noisy.Slug hit decking and went whee whee hoo off somewhere.I faded back.One man hurt  that guard.When first press of passengers had gone down ramp, he was on deck, not moving.Nobody paid attention; they walked around or stepped over  except one woman carrying a baby, who stopped, kicked him carefully in face, then went down ramp.He may have been dead already, didn't wait to see.Understand body stayed there till relief arrived.Next day was a half squad in that spot.Capsule for Novylen left empty.It settled down.Those who had to travel got passports, diehards quit traveling.Guard at a tube gate became two men, one looked at passports while other stood back with gun drawn.One who checked passports did not try hard, which was well as most were counterfeit and early ones were crude.But before long, authentic paper was stolen and counterfeits were as dinkum as official ones  more expensive but Loonies preferred free enterprise passports.Our organization did not make counterfeits; we merely encouraged it  and knew who had them and who did not; Mike's records listed officially issued ones.This helped separate sheep from goats in files we were building  also stored in Mike but in "Bastille" location  as we figured a man with counterfeit passport was halfway to joining us.Word was passed down cells in our growing organization never to recruit anybody with a valid passport.If recruiter was not certain, just query upwards and answer came back.But guards' troubles were not over.Does not help a guard's dignity nor add to peace of mind to have children stand in front of him, or behind out of eye which was worse, and ape every move he makes  or run back and forth screaming obscenities, jeering, making finger motions that are universal.At least guards took them as insults.One guard back handed a small boy, cost him some teeth.Result: two guards dead, one Loonie dead.After that, guards ignored children.We didn't have to work this up; we merely encouraged it.You wouldn't think that a sweet old lady like my senior wife would encourage children to misbehave.But she did.Other things get single men a long way from home upset  and one we did start.These Peace Dragoons had been sent to The Rock without a comfort detachment.Some of our fems were extremely beautiful and some started loitering around stations, dressed in less than usual  which could approach zero  and wearing more than usual amount of perfume, scents with range and striking power.They did not speak to yellow jackets nor look at them; they simply crossed their line of sight, undulating as only a Loonie gal can.(A female on Terra can't walk that way; she's tied down by six times too much weight. )Such of course produces a male gallery, from men down to lads not yet pubescent  happy whistles and cheers for her beauty, nasty laughs at yellow boy.First girls to take this duty were slot machine types but volunteers sprang up so fast that Prof decided we need not spend money.He was correct: even Ludmilla, shy as a kitten, wanted to try it and did not only because Mum told her not to.But Lenore, ten years older and prettiest of our family, did try it and Mum did not scold.She came back pink and excited and pleased with herself and anxious to tease enemy again.Her own idea; Lenore did not then know that revolution was brewing.During this time I rarely saw Prof and never in public; we kept touch by phone.At first a bottleneck was that our farm had just one phone for twenty five people, many of them youngsters who would tie up a phone for hours unless coerced.Mimi was strict; our kids were allowed one out going call per day and max of ninety seconds on a call, with rising scale of punishment  tempered by her warmth in granting exceptions.But grants were accompanied by "Mum's Phone Lecture": "When I first came to Luna there were no private phones.You children don't know how soft... "We were one of last prosperous families to install a phone; it was new in household when I was opted.We were prosperous because we never bought anything farm could produce.Mum disliked phone because rates to Luna City Co op Comm Company were passed on in large measure to Authority.She never could understand why I could not ("Since you know all about such things, Manuel dear") steal phone service as easily as we liberated power.That a phone instrument was part of a switching system into which it must fit was no interest to her.Steal it I did, eventually.Problem with illicit phone is how to receive incoming calls.Since phone is not listed, even if you tell persons from whom you want calls, switching system itself does not have you listed; is no signal that can tell it to connect other party with you.Once Mike joined conspiracy, switching was no problem.I had in workshop most of what I needed; bought some items and liberated others.Drilled a tiny hole from workshop to phone cupboard and another to Wyoh's room  virgin rock a meter thick but a laser drill collimated to a thin pencil cuts rapidly.I unshipped listed phone, made a wireless coupling to line in its recess and concealed it.All else needed were binaural receptors and a speaker in Wyoh's room, concealed, and same in mine, and a circuit to raise frequency above audio to have silence on Davis phone line, and its converse to restore audio incoming.Only problem was to do this without being seen, and Mum generaled that.All else was Mike's problem.Used no switching arrangements; from then on used MYCROFTXXX only when calling from some other phone.Mike listened at all times in workshop and in Wyoh's room; if he heard my voice or hers say "Mike," he answered, but not to other voices.Voice patterns were as distinctive to him as fingerprints; he never made mistakes.Minor flourishes  soundprooflng Wyoh's door such as workshop door already had, switching to suppress my instrument or hers, signals to tell me she was alone in her room and door locked, and vice versa.All added up to safe means whereby Wyob and I could talk with Mike or with each other, or could set up talk talk of Mike, Wyoh, Prof, and self.Mike would call Prof wherever he was; Prof would talk or call back from a more private phone.Or might be Wyoh or myself had to be found.We all were careful to stay checked in with Mike.My bootleg phone, though it had no way to punch a call, could be used to call any number in Luna  speak to Mike, ask for a Sherlock to anybody  not tell him number, Mike had all listings and could look up a number faster than I could.We were beginning to see unlimited possibilities in a phoneswitching system alive and on our side.I got from Mike and gave Mum still another null number to call Mike if she needed to reach me.She grew chummy with Mike while continuing to think he was a man.This spread through our family.One day as I returned home Sidris said, "Mannie darling, your friend with the nice voice called.Mike Holmes.Wants you to call back. ""Thanks, hon.Will. ""When are you going to invite him to dinner, Man?I think he's nice. "I told her Gospodin Holmes had bad breath, was covered with rank hair, and hated women.She used a rude word, Mum not being in earshot."You're afraid to let me see him.Afraid I'll opt out for him. "I patted her and told her that was why.I told Mike and Prof about it.Mike flirted even more with my womenfolk after that; Prof was thoughtful.I began to learn techniques of conspiracy and to appreciate Prof's feeling that revolution could be an art.Did not forget (nor ever doubt) Mike's prediction that Luna was only seven years from disaster.But did not think about it, thought about fascinating, finicky details.Prof had emphasized that stickiest problems in conspiracy are communications and security, and had pointed out that they conflict  easier are communications, greater is risk to security; if security is tight, organization can be paralyzed by safety precautions.He had explained that cell system was a compromise.I accepted cell system since was necessary to limit losses from spies.Even Wyoh admitted that organization without compartmentation could not work after she learned how rotten with spies old underground had been.But I did not like clogged communications of cell system; like Terran dinosaurs of old, took too long to send message from head to tail, or back.So talked with Mike.We discarded many linked channels I had suggested to Prof.We retained cells but based security and communication on marvelous possibilities of our dinkum thinkum.Communications:            We set up a ternary tree of "party" names:  Chairman, Gospodin Adam Selene (Mike)  Executive cell: Bork (me), Betty (Wyoh), Bill (Prof)  Bork's cell: Cassie (Mum), Colin, Chang  Betty's cell: Calvin (Greg), Cecilia (Sidris), Clayton  Bill's cell: Cornwall (Finn Nielsen), Carolyn, Cotter    and so on.At seventh link George supervises Herbert, Henry, and Hallie.By time you reach that level you need 2,187 names with "H"  but turn it over to savvy computer who finds or invents them.Each recruit is given a party name and an emergency phone number.This number, instead of chasing through many links, connects with "Adam Selene," Mike.Security: Based on double principle; no human being can be trusted with anything  but Mike could be trusted with everything.Grim first half is beyond dispute.With drugs and other unsavory methods any man can be broken.Only defense is suicide, which may be impossible.Oh, are "hollow tooth" methods, classic and novel, some nearly infallible  Prof saw to it that Wyoh and myself were equipped.Never knew what he gave her as a final friend and since I never had to use mine, is no point in messy details.Nor am I sure I would ever suicide; am not stuff of martyrs.But Mike could never need to suicide, could not be drugged, did not feel pain.He carried everything concerning us in a separate memory bank under a locked signal programmed only to our three voices, and, since flesh is weak, we added a signal under which any of us could lock out other two in emergency.In my opinion as best computerman in Luna, Mike could not remove this lock once it was set up.Best of all, nobody would ask master computer for this file because nobody knew it existed, did not suspect Mike as Mike existed.How secure can you be?Only risk was that this awakened machine was whimsical.Mike was always showing unforeseen potentials; conceivable he could figure way to get around block  if he wanted to.But would never want to.He was loyal to me, first and oldest friend; he liked Prof; I think he loved Wyoh.No, no, sex meant nothing.But Wyoh is lovable and they hit it off from start.I trusted Mike.In this life you have to bet; on that bet I would give any odds.So we based security on trusting Mike with everything while each of us knew only what he had to know.Take that tree of names and numbers.I knew only party names of my cellmates and of three directly under me; was all I needed.Mike set up party names, assigned phone number to each, kept roster of real names versus party names.Let's say party member "Daniel" (whom I would not know, being a "D" two levels below me) recruits Fritz Schultz.Daniel reports fact but not name upwards; Adam Selene calls Daniel, assigns for Schultz party name "Embrook," then phones Schultz at number received from Daniel, gives Schultz his name Embrook and emergency phone number, this number being different for each recruit.Not even Embrook's cell leader would know Embrook's emergency number.What you do not know you cannot spill, not under drugs nor torture, nor anything.Not even from carelessness.Now let's suppose I need to reach Comrade Embrook.I don't know who he is; he may live in Hong Kong or be shopkeeper nearest my home.Instead of passing message down, hoping it will reach him, I call Mike.Mike connects me with Embrook at once, in a Sherlock, withoul giving me his number.Or suppose I need to speak to comrade who is preparing cartoon we are about to distribute in every taproom in Luna.I don't know who he is.But I need to talk to him; something has come up.I call Mike; Mike knows everything  and again I am quickly connected  and this comrade knows it's okay as Adam Selene arranged call."Comrade Bork speaking"  and he doesn't know me but initial "B" tells him that I am vip indeed  "we have to change so and so.Tell your cell leader and have him check, but get on with it. "Minor flourishes  some comrades did not have phones; some could be reached only at certain hours; some outlying warrens did not have phone service.No matter, Mike knew everything  and rest of us did not know anything that could endanger any but that handful whom each knew face to face.After we decided that Mike should talk voice to voice to any comrade under some circumstances, it was necessary to give him more voices and dress him up, make him three dimensions, create "Adam Selene, Chairman of the Provisional Committee of Free Luna. "Mike's need for more voices lay in fact that he had just one voder vocoder, whereas his brain could handle a dozen conversations, or a hundred (don't know how many)  like a chess master playing fifty opponents, only more so.This would cause a bottleneck as organization grew and Adam Selene was phoned oftener, and could be crucial if we lasted long enough to go into action.Besides giving him more voices I wanted to silence one he had.One of those so called computermen might walk into machines room while we were phoning Mike; bound to cause even his dim wit to wonder if he found master machine apparently talking to itself.Voder vocoder is very old device.Human voice is buzzes and hisses mixed various ways; true even of a coloratura soprano.A vocoder analyzes buzzes and hisses into patterns, one a computer (or trained eye) can read.A voder is a little box which can buzz and hiss and has controls to vary these elements to match those patterns.A human can "play" a voder, producing artificial speech; a properly programmed computer can do it as fast, as easily, as clearly as you can speak.But voices on a phone wire are not sound waves but electrical signals; Mike did not need audio part of voder vocoder to talk by phone.Sound waves were needed only by human at other end; no need for speech sounds inside Mike's room at Authority Complex.so I planned to remove them, and thereby any danger that somebody might notice.First I worked at home, using number three arm most of time.Result was very small box which sandwiched twenty voder vocoder circuits minus audio side.Then I called Mike and told him to "get ill" in way that would annoy Warden.Then I waited.We had done this "get ill" trick before.I went back to work once we learned that I was clear, which was Thursday that same week when Alvarez read into Zebra file an account of shambles at Stilyagi Hall.His version listed about one hundred people (out of perhaps three hundred); list included Shorty Mkrum, Wyoh, Prof, and Finn Nielsen but not me  apparently I was missed by his finks.It told how nine police officers, each deputized by Warden to preserve peace, had been shot down in cold blood.Also named three of our dead.An add on a week later stated that "the notorious agente provocateuse Wyoming Knott of Hong Kong in Luna, whose incendiary speech on Monday 13 May had incited the riot that cost the lives of nine brave officers, had not been apprehended in Luna City and had not returned to her usual haunts in Hong Kong in Luna, and was now believed to have died in the massacre she herself set off. "This add on admitted what earlier report failed to mention, i. e. , bodies were missing and exact number of dead was not known.This P. S.  settled two things: Wyoh could not go home nor back to being a blonde.Since I had not been spotted I resumed my public ways, took care of customers that week, bookkeeping machines and retrieval files at Carnegie Library, and spent time having Mike read out Zebra file and other special files, doing so in Room L of Raffles as I did not yet have my own phone.During that week Mike niggled at me like an impatient child (which he was), wanting to know when I was coming over to pick up more jokes.Failing that, he wanted to tell them by phone.I got annoyed and had to remind myself that from Mike's viewpoint analyzing jokes was just as important as freeing Luna  and you don't break promises to a child.Besides that.I got itchy wondering whether I could go inside Complex without being nabbed.We knew Prof was not clear, was sleeping in Raffles on that account.Yet they knew he had been at meeting and knew where he was, daily  but no attempt was made to pick him up.When we learned that attempt had been made to pick up Wyoh, I grew itchier.Was I clear?Or were they waiting to nab me quietly?Had to know.So I called Mike and told him to have a tummyache.He did so, I was called in  no trouble.Aside from showing passport at station, then to a new guard at Complex, all was usual.I chatted with Mike, picked up one thousand jokes (with understanding that we would report a hundred at a time every three or four days, no faster), told him to get well, and went back to L City, stopping on way out to bill Chief Engineer for working time, travel and tool time, materials, special service, anything I could load in.Thereafter saw Mike about once a month.Was safe, never went there except when they called me for malfunction beyond ability of their staff  and I was always able to "repair" it, sometimes quickly, sometimes after a full day and many tests.Was careful to leave tool marks on cover plates, and had before and after print outs of test runs to show what had been wrong, how I analyzed it, what I had done.Mike always worked perfectly after one of my visits; I was indispensable.So, after I prepared his new voder vocoder add on, didn't hesitate to tell him to get "ill. "Call came in thirty minutes.Mike had thought up a dandy; his "illness" was wild oscillations in conditioning Warden's residence.He was running its heat up, then down, on an eleven minute cycle, while oscillating its air pressure on a short cycle, ca.2c/s, enough to make a man dreadfully nervy and perhaps cause earache.Conditioning a single residence should not go through a master computer!In Davis Tunnels we handled home and farm with idiot controls, feedbacks for each cubic with alarms so that somebody could climb out of bed and control by hand until trouble could be found.If cows got chilly, did not hurt corn; if lights failed over wheat, vegetables were okay.That Mike could raise hell with Warden's residence and nobody could figure out what to do shows silliness of piling everything into one computer.Mike was happy joyed.This was humor he really scanned.I enjoyed it, too, told him to go ahead, have fun  spread out tools, got out little black box.And computerman of the watch comes banging and ringing at door.I took my time answering and carried number five arm in right hand with short wing bare; this makes some people sick and upsets almost everybody."What in hell do you want, choom?"I inquired."Listen," he says, "Warden is raising hell!Haven't you found trouble?""My compliments to Warden and tell him I will override by hand to restore his precious comfort as soon as I locate faulty circuit  if not slowed up by silly questions.Are you going to stand with door open blowing dust into machines while I have cover plates off?If you do  since you're in charge  when dust puts machine on sputter, you can repair it.I won't leave a warm bed to help.You can tell that to your bloody Warden, too. ""Watch your language, cobber. ""Watch yours, convict.Are you going to close that door?Or shall I walk out and go back to L City?"And raised number five like a club.He closed door.Had no interest in insulting poor sod.Was one small bit of policy to make everybody as unhappy as possible.He was finding working for Warden difficult; I wanted to make it unbearable."Shall I step it up?"Mike inquired."Um, hold it so for ten minutes, then stop abruptly.Then jog it for an hour, say with air pressure.Erratic but hard.Know what a sonic boom is?""Certainly.It is a  "  "Don't define.After you drop major effect, rattle his air ducts every few minutes with nearest to a boom system will produce.Then give him something to remember.Mmm...Mike, can you make his W. C.  run backwards?""I surely can!All of them?""How many does he have?""Six. ""Well...program to give them all a push, enough to soak his rugs.But if you can spot one nearest his bedroom, fountain it clear to ceiling.Can?""Program set up!""Good.Now for your present, ducky. "There was room in voder audio box to hide it and I spent forty minutes with number three, getting it just so.We trial checked through voder vocoder, then I told him to call Wyoh and check each circuit.For ten minutes was silence, which I spent putting tool markers on a cover plate which should have been removed had been anything wrong, putting tools away, putting number six arm on, rolling up one thousand jokes waiting in print out.I had found no need to cut out audio of voder; Mike had thought of it before I had and always chopped off any time door was touched.Since his reflexes were better than mine by a factor of at least a thousand, I forgot it.At last he said, "All twenty circuits okay.I can switch circuits in the middle of a word and Wyoh can't detect discontinuity.And I called Prof and said Hello and talked to Mum on your home phone, all three at the same time. ""We're in business.What excuse you give Mum?""I asked her to have you call me, Adam Selene that is.Then we chatted.She's a charming conversationalist.We discussed Greg's sermon of last Tuesday. ""Huh?How?""I told her I had listened to it, Man, and quoted a poetic part. ""Oh, Mike!""It's okay, Man.I let her think that I sat in back, then slipped out during the closing hymn.She's not nosy; she knows that I don't want to be seen. "Mum is nosiest female in Luna."Guess it's okay.But don't do it again.Um   Do do it again.You go to  you monitor   meetings and lectures and concerts and stuff. ""Unless some busybody switches me off by hand!Man, I can't control those spot pickups the way I do a phone. ""Too simple a switch.Brute muscle rather than solid state flipflop. ""That's barbaric.And unfair. ""Mike, almost everything is unfair.What can't be cured  "  "  must be endured.That's a funny once, Man. ""Sorry.Let's change it: What can't be cured should be tossed out and something better put in.Which we'll do.What chances last time you calculated?""Approximately one in nine, Man. ""Getting worse?""Man, they'll get worse for months.We haven't reached the crisis. ""With Yankees in cellar, too.Oh, well.Back to other matter.From now on, when you talk to anyone, if he's been to a lecture or whatever, you were there, too  and prove it, by recalling something. ""Noted.Why, Man?""Have you read 'The Scarlet Pimpernel'?May be in public library. ""Yes.Shall I read it back?""No, no!You're our Scarlet Pinipernel, our John Galt, our Swamp Fox, our man of mystery.You go everywhere, know everything, slip in and out of town without passport.You're always there, yet nobody catches sight of you. "His lights rippled, he gave a subdued chuckle."That's fun, Man.Funny once, funny twice, maybe funny always. ""Funny always.How long ago did you stop gymkhana at Warden's?""Forty three minutes ago except erratic booms. ""Bet his teeth ache!Give him fifteen minutes more.Then I'll report job completed. ""Noted.Wyoh sent you a message, Man.She said to remind you of Billy's birthday party. ""Oh, my word!Stop everything, I'm leaving.'Bye!"I hurried out.Billy's mother is Anna.Probably her last  and right well she's done by us, eight kids, three still home.I try to be as careful as Mum never to show favoritism...but Billy is quite a boy and I taught him to read.Possible he looks like me.Stopped at Chief Engineer's office to leave bill and demanded to see him.Was let in and he was in belligerent mood; Warden had been riding him."Hold it," I told him."My son's birthday and shan't be late.But must show you something. "Took an envelope from kit, dumped item on desk: corpse of house fly which I had charred with a hot wire and fetched.We do not tolerate flies in Davis Tunnels but sometimes one wanders in from city as locks are opened.This wound up in my workshop just when I needed it."See that?Guess where I found it. "On that faked evidence I built a lecture on care of fine machines, talked about doors opened, complained about man on watch."Dust can ruin a computer.Insects are unpardonable!Yet your watchstanders wander in and out as if tube station.Today both doors held open  while this idiot yammered.If I find more evidence that cover plates have been removed by hoof handed choom who attracts flies  well, it's your plant, Chief.Got more than I can handle, been doing your chores because I like fine machines.Can't stand to see them abused!Good bye. ""Hold on.I want to tell you something. ""Sorry, got to go.Take it or leave it, I'm no vermin exterminator; I'm a computerman. "Nothing frustrates a man so much as not letting him get in his say.With luck and help from Warden, Chief Engineer would have ulcers by Christmas.Was late anyhow and made humble apology to Billy.Alvarez had thought up new wrinkle, close search on leaving Complex.I endured it with never a nasty word for Dragoons who searched me; wanted to get home.But those thousand jokes bothered them."What's this?"one demanded."Computer paper," I said."Test runs. "His mate joined him.Don't think they could read.They wanted to confiscate, so I demanded they call Chief Engineer.They let me go.I felt not displeased; more and more such and guards were daily more hated.Decision to make Mike more a person arose from need to have any Party member phone him on occasion; my advice about concerts and plays was simply a side effect.Mike's voice over phone had odd quality I had not noticed during time I had visited him only at Complex.When you speak to a man by phone there is background noise.And you hear him breathe, hear heartbeats, body motions even though rarely conscious of these.Besides that, even if he speaks under a hush hood, noises get through, enough to "fill space," make him a body with surroundings.With Mike was none of this.By then Mike's voice was "human" in timbre and quality, recognizable.He was baritone, had North American accent with Aussie overtones; as "Michelle" he (she?)had a light soprano with French flavor.Mike's personality grew also.When first I introduced him to Wyoh and Prof he sounded like a pedantic child; in short weeks he flowered until I visualized a man about own age.His voice when he first woke was blurred and harsh, hardly understandable.Now it was clear and choice of words and phrasing was consistent  colloquial to me, scholarly to Prof, gallant to Wyoh, variation one expects of mature adults.But background was dead.Thick silence.So we filled it.Mike needed only hints.He did not make his breathing noisy, ordinarily you would not notice.But he would stick in touches."Sorry, Mannie, you caught me bathing when the phone sounded"  and let one hear hurried breathing.Or "I was eating  had to swallow. "He used such even on me, once he undertook to "be a human body. "We all put "Adam Selene" together, talking it over at Raffles.How old was he?What did he look like?Married?Where did he live?What work?What interests?We decided that Adam was about forty, healthy, vigorous, well educated, interested in all arts and sciences and very well grounded in history, a match chess player but  little time to play.He was married in commonest type, a troika in which he was senior husband  four children.Wife and junior husband not in politics, so far as we knew.He was ruggedly handsome with wavy iron gray hair and was mixed race, second generation one side, third on other.Was wealthy by Loonie standards, with interests in Novylen and Kongville as well as L City.He kept offices in Luna City, outer office with a dozen people plus private office staffed by male deputy and female secretary.Wyoh wanted to know was he bundling with secretary?I told her to switch off, was private.Wyoh said indignantly that she was not being snoopy  weren't we trying to create a rounded character?We decided that offices were in Old Dome, third ramp, southside, heart of financial district.If you know L City.you recall that in Old Dome some offices have windows since they can look out over floor of Dome; I wanted this for sound effects.We drew a floor plan and had that office existed, it would have been between Aetna Luna and Greenberg & Co.I used pouch recorder to pick up sounds at spot; Mike added to it by listening at phones there.Thereafter when you called Adam Selene, background was not dead.If "Ursula," his secretary, took call, it was: "Selene Associates.Luna shall be free!"Then she might say, "Will you hold?Gospodin Selene is on another call" whereupon you might hear sound of W. C. , followed by running water and know that she had told little white lie.Or Adam might answer: "Adam Selene here.Free Luna.One second while I shut off the video. "Or deputy might answer: "This is Albert Ginwallah, Adam Selene's confidential assistant.Free Luna.If it's a Party matter  as I assume it is; that was your Party name you gave  please don't hesitate; I handle such things for the Chairman. "Last was a trap, as every comrade was instructed to speak only to Adam Selene.No attempt was made to discipline one who took bait; instead his cell captain was warned that his comrade must not be trusted with anything vital.We got echoes."Free Luna!"or "Luna shall be free!"took hold among youngsters, then among solid citizens.First time I heard it in a business call I almost swallowed teeth.Then called Mike and asked if this person was Party member?Was not.So I recommended that Mike trace down Party tree and see if somebody could recruit him.Most interesting echo was in File Zebra."Adam Selene" appeared in boss fink's security file less than a lunar after we created him, with notation that this was a cover name for a leader in a new underground.Alvarez's spies did a job on Adam Selene.Over course of months his File Zebra dossier built up: Male, 34 45, offices south face of Old Dome, usually there 0900 1800 Gr.except Saturday but calls are relayed at other hours, home inside urban pressure as travel time never exceeds seventeen minutes.Children in household.Activities include stock brokerage, farming interests.Attends theater, concerts, etc.Probably member Luna City Chess Club and Luna Assoc, d'Echecs.Plays ricochet and other heavy sports lunch hour, probably Luna City Athletic Club.Gourmet but watches weight.Remarkable memory plus mathematical ability.Executive type, able to reach decisions quickly.One fink was convinced that he had talked to Adam between acts at revival of Hamlet by Civic Players; Alvarez noted description  and matched our picture all but wavy hair!But thing that drove Alvarez crackers was that phone numbers for Adam were reported and every time they turned out wrong numbers.(Not nulls; we had run out and Mike was using any number not in use and switching numbers anytime new subscribers were assigned ones we had been using. )Alvarez tried to trace "Selene Associates" using a one wrong digit assumption  this we learned because Mike was keeping an ear on Alvarez's office phone and heard order.Mike used knowledge to play a Mikish prank: Subordinate who made one changed digit calls invariably reached Warden's private residence.So Alvarez was called in and chewed by Warden.Couldn't scold Mike but did warn him it would alert any smart person to fact that somebody was playing tricks with computer.Mike answered that they were not that smart.Main result of Alvarez's efforts was that each time he got a number for Adam we located a spy  a new spy, as those we had spotted earlier were never given phone numbers; instead they were recruited into a tail chasing organization where they could inform on each other.But with Alvarez's help we spotted each new spy almost at once.I think Alvarez became unhappy over spies he was able to hire; two disappeared and our organization, then over six thousand, was never able to find them.Eliminated, I suppose, or died under questioning.Selene Associates was not only phony company we set up.LuNoHoCo was much larger, just as phony, and not at all dummy; it had main offices in Hong Kong, branches in Novy Leningrad and Luna City, eventually employed hundreds of people most of whom were not Party members, and was our most difficult operation.Mike's master plan listed a weary number of problems which had to be solved.One was finance.Another was how to protect catapult from space attack.Prof considered robbing banks to solve first, gave it up reluctantly.But eventually we did rob banks, firms, and Authority itself.Mike thought of it.Mike and Prof worked it out.At first was not clear to Mike why we needed money.He knew as little about pressure that keeps humans scratching as he knew about sex; Mike handled millions of dollars and could not see any problem.He started by offering to issue an Authority cheque for whatever dollars we wanted.Prof shied in horror.He then explained to Mike hazard in trying to cash a cheque for, let us say, AS$l0,000,000 drawn on Authority.So they undertook to do it, but retail, in many names and places all over Luna.Every bank, firm, shop, agency including Authority, for which Mike did accounting, was tapped for Party funds.Was a pyramided swindle based on fact, unknown to me but known to Prof and latent in Mike's immense knowledge, that most money is simply bookkeeping.Example  multiply by hundreds of many types: My family son Sergei, eighteen and a Party member, is asked to start account at Commonwealth Shared Risk.He makes deposits and withdrawals.Small errors are made each time; he is credited with more than he deposits, is debited with less than he withdraws.A few months later he takes job out of town and transfers account to Tycho Under Mutual; transferred funds are three times already inflated amount.Most of this he soon draws out in cash and passes to his cell leader.Mike knows amount Sergei should hand over, but (since they do not know that Adam Selene and bank's computer bookeeper are one and same) they have each been instructed to report transaction to Adam  keep them honest though scheme was not.Multiply this theft of about HK$3,000 by hundreds somewhat like it.I can't describe jiggery pokery Mike used to balance his books while keeping thousands of thefts from showing.But bear in mind that an auditor must assume that machines are honest.He will make test runs to check that machines are working correctly  but will not occur to him that tests prove nothing because machine itself is dishonest.Mike's thefts were never large enough to disturb economy; like half liter of blood, amount was too small to hurt donor.I can't make up mind who lost, money was swapped around so many ways.But scheme troubled me; I was brought up to be honest, except with Authority.Prof claimed that what was taking place was a mild inflation offset by fact that we plowed money back in  but I should remember that Mike had records and all could be restored after Revolution, with ease since we would no longer be bled in much larger amounts by Authority.I told conscience to go to sleep.Was pipsqueak compared to swindles by every government throughout history in financing every war  and is not revolution a war?This money, after passing through many hands (augmented by Mike each time), wound up as senior financing of LuNoHo Company.Was a mixed company, mutual and stock; "gentleman adventurer" guarantors who backed stock put up that stolen money in own names.Won't discuss bookkeeping this firm used.Since Mike ran everything, was not corrupted by any tinge of honesty.Nevertheless its shares were traded in Hong Kong Luna Exchange and listed in Zurich, London, and New York.Wall Street Journal called it "an attractive high risk high gain investment with novel growth potential. "LuNoHoCo was an engineering and exploitation firm, engaged in many ventures, mostly legitimate.But prime purpbse was to build a second catapult, secretly.Operation could not be secret.You can't buy or build a hydrogen fusion power plant for such and not have it noticed.(Sunpower was rejected for obvious reasons. )Parts were ordered from Pittsburgh, standard UnivCalif equipment, and we happily paid their royalties to get top quality.Can't build a stator for a kilometers long induction field without having it noticed, either.But most important you cannot do major construction hiring many people and not have it show.Sure, catapults are mostly vacuum; stator rings aren't even close together at ejection end.But Authority's 3 g catapult was almost one hundred kilometers long.It was not only an astrogation landmark, on every Luna jump chart, but was so big it could be photographed or seen by eye from Terra with not large telescope.It showed up beautifully on a radar screen.We were building a shorter catapult, a 10 g job, but even that was thirty kilometers long, too big to hide.So we hid it by Purloined Letter method.I used to question Mike's endless reading of fiction, wondering what notions he was getting.But turned out he got a better feeling for human life from stories than he had been able to garner from facts; fiction gave him a gestalt of life, one taken for granted by a human; he lives it.Besides this "humanizing" effect, Mike's substitute for experience, he got ideas from "not true data" as he called fiction.How to hide a catapult he got from Edgar Allan Poe.We hid it in literal sense, too; this catapult had to be underground, so that it would not show to eye or radar.But had to be hidden in more subtle sense; selenographic location had to be secret.How can this be, with a monster that big, worked on by so many people?Put it this way: Suppose you live in Novylen; know where Luna City is?Why, on east edge of Mare Crisium; everybody knows that.So?What latitude and longitude?Huh?Look it up in a reference book!So?If you don't know where any better than that, how did you find it last week?No huhu, cobber; I took tube, changed at Torricelli, slept rest of way; finding it was capsule's worry.See?You don't know where Luna City is!You simply get out when capsule pulls in at Tube Station South.That's how we hid catapult.Is in Mare Undarum area, "everybody knows that. "But where it is and where we said it was differ by amount greater or less than one hundred kilometers in direction north, south, east, or west, or some combination.Today you can look up its location in reference books  and find same wrong answer.Location of that catapult is still most closely guarded secret in Luna.Can't be seen from space, by eye or radar.Is underground save for ejection and that is a big black shapeless hole like ten thousand others and high up an uninviting mountain with no place for a jump rocket to put down.Nevertheless many people were there, during and after construction.Even Warden visited and my co husband Greg showed him around.Warden went by mail rocket, commandeered for day, and his Cyborg was given coordinates and a radar beacon to home on  a spot in fact not far from site.But from there, it was necessary to travel by rolligon and our lorries were not like passenger buses from Endsville to Beluthihatchie in old days; they were cargo carriers, no ports for sightseeing and a ride so rough that human cargo had to be strapped down.Warden wanted to ride up in cab but  sorry, Gospodin!just space for wrangler and his helper and took both to keep her steady.Three hours later he did not care about anything but getting home.He stayed one hour and was not interested in talk about purpose of all this drilling and value of resources uncovered.Less important people, workmen and others, traveled by interconnecting ice exploration bores, still easier way to get lost.If anybody carried an inertial pathfinder in his luggage, he could have located site  but security was tight.One did so and had accident with p suit; his effects were returned to L City and his pathfinder read what it should  i. e. , what we wanted it to read, for I made hurried trip out with number three arm along.You can reseal one without a trace if you do it in nitrogen atmosphere  I wore an oxygen mask at slight overpressure.No huhu.We entertained vips from Earth, some high in Authority.They traveled easier underground route; I suppose Warden had warned them.But even on that route is one thirty kilometer stretch by rolligon.We had one visitor from Earth who looked like trouble, a Dr.Dorian, physicist and engineer.Lorry tipped over  silly driver tried shortcut  they were not in line of sight for anything and their beacon was smashed.Poor Dr.Dorian spent seventy two hours in an unsealed pumice igloo and had to be returned to L City ill from hypoxia and overdose of radiation despite efforts on his behalf by two Party members driving him.Might have been safe to let him see; he might not have spotted doubletalk and would not have spotted error in location.Few people look at stars when p suited even when Sun doesn't make it futile; still fewer can read stars  and nobody can locate himself on surface without help unless he has instruments, knows how to use them and has tables and something to give a time tick.Put at crudest level, minimum would be octant, tables, and good watch.Our visitors were even encouraged to go out on surface but if one had carried an octant or modern equivalent, might have had accident.We did not make accidents for spies.We let them stay, worked them hard, and Mike read their reports.One reported that he was certain that we had found uranium ore, something unknown in Luna at that time.Project Centerbore being many years later.Next spy came out with kit of radiation counters.We made it easy for him to sneak them through bore.By March '76 catapult was almost ready, lacking only installation of stator segments.Power plant was in and a co ax had been strung underground with a line of sight link for that thirty kilometers.Crew was down to skeleton size, mostly Party members.But we kept one spy so that Alvarez could have regular reports  didn't want him to worry; it tended to make him suspicious.Instead we worried him in warrens.10   Were changes in those eleven months.Wyoh was baptized into Greg's church, Prof's health became so shaky that he dropped teaching, Mike took up writing poetry.Yankees finished in cellar.Wouldn't have minded paying Prof if they had been nosed out, but from pennant to cellar in one season  I quit watching them on video.Prof's illness was phony.He was in perfect shape for age, exercising in hotel room three hours each day, and sleeping in three hundred kilograms of lead pajamas.And so was I, and so was Wyoh, who hated it.I don't think she ever cheated and spent night in comfort though can't say for sure; I was not dossing with her.She had become a fixture in Davis family.Took her one day to go from "Gospazha Davis" to "Gospazha Mum," one more to reach "Mum" and now it might be "Mimi Mum" with arm around Mum's waist.When Zebra File showed she couldn't go back to Hong Kong, Sidris had taken Wyoh into her beauty shop after hours and done a job which left skin same dark shade but would not scrub off.Sidris also did a hairdo on Wyoh that left it black and looking as if unsuccessfully unkinked.Plus minor touches  opaque nail enamel, plastic inserts for cheeks and nostrils and of course she wore her dark eyed contact lenses.When Sidris got through, Wyoh could have gone bundling without fretting about her disguise; was a perfect "colored" with ancestry to match  Tamil, a touch of Angola, German.I called her "Wyma" rather than "Wyoh. "She was gorgeous.When she undulated down a corridor, boys followed in swarms.She started to learn farming from Greg but Mum put stop to that.While she was big and smart and willing, our farm is mostly a male operation  and Greg and Hans were not only male members of our family distracted; she cost more farming man hours than her industry equaled.So Wyoh went back to housework, then Sidris took her into beauty shop as helper.Prof played ponies with two accounts, betting one by Mike's "leading apprentice" system, other by his own "scientific" system.By July '75 he admitted that he knew nothing about horses and went solely to Mike's system, increasing bets and spreading them among many bookies.His winnings paid Party's expenses while Mike built swindle that financed catapult.But Prof lost interest in a sure thing and merely placed bets as Mike designated.He stopped reading pony journals  sad, something dies when an old horseplayer quits.Ludmilla had a girl which they say is lucky in a first and which delighted me  every family needs a girl baby.Wyoh surprised our women by being expert in midwifery  and surprised them again that she knew nothing about baby care.Our two oldest sons found marriages at last and Teddy, thirteen, was opted out.Greg hired two lads from neighbor farms and, after six months of working and eating with us, both were opted in  not rushing things, we had known them and their families for years.It restored balance we had lacked since Ludmilla's opting and put stop to snide remarks from mothers of bachelors who had not found marriages   not that Mum wasn't capable of snubbing anyone she did not consider up to Davis standards.Wyoh recruited Sidris; Sidris started own cell by recruiting her other assistant and Bon Ton Beaute Shoppe became hotbed of subversion.We started using our smallest kids for deliveries and other jobs a child can do  they can stake out or trail a person through corridors better than an adult, and are not suspected.Sidris grabbed this notion and expanded it through women recruited in beauty parlor.Soon she had so many kids on tap that we could keep all of Alvarez's spies under surveillance.With Mike able to listen at any phone and a child spotting it whenever a spy left home or place of work or wherever  with enough kids on call so that one could phone while another held down a new stakeout  we could keep a spy under tight observation and keep him from seeing anything we didn't want him to see.Shortly we were getting reports spies phoned in without waiting for Zebra File; it did a sod no good to phone from a taproom instead of home; with Baker Street Irregulars on job Mike was listening before he finished punching number.These kids located Alvarez's deputy spy boss in L City.We knew he had one because these finks did not report to Alvarez by phone, nor did it seem possible that Alvarez could have recruited them as none of them worked in Complex and Alvarez came inside Luna City only when an Earthside vip was so important as to rate a bodyguard commanded by Alvarez in person.His deputy turned out to be two people  an old lag who ran a candy, news, and bookie counter in Old Dome and his son who was on civil service in Complex.Son carried reports in, so Mike had not been able to hear them.We let them alone.But from then on we had fink field reports half a day sooner than Alvarez.This advantage  all due to kids as young as five or six  saved lives of seven comrades.All glory to Baker Street Irregulars!Don't remember who named them but think it was Mike  I was merely a Sherlock Homes fan whereas he really did think he was Sherlock Holmes's brother Mycroft...nor would I swear he was not; "reality" is a slippery notion.Kids did not call themselves that; they had their own play gangs with own names.Nor were they burdened with secrets which could endanger them; Sidris left it to mothers to explain why they were being asked to do these jobs save that they were never to be told real reason.Kids will do anything mysterious and fun; look how many of their games are based on outsmarting.Bon Ton salon was a clearinghouse of gossip  women get news faster than Daily Lunatic.I encouraged Wyoh to report to Mike each night, not try to thin gossip down to what seemed significant because was no telling what might be significant once Mike got through associating it with a million other facts.Beauty parlor was also place to start rumors.Party had grown slowly at first, then rapidly as powers of three began to be felt and also because Peace Dragoons were nastier than older bodyguard.As numbers increased we shifted to high speed on agitprop, black propaganda rumors, open subversion, provocateur activities, and sabotage.Finn Nielsen handled agitprop when it was simpler as well as dangerous job of continuing to front for and put cover up activity into older, spyridden underground.But now a large chunk of agitprop and related work was given to Sidris.
