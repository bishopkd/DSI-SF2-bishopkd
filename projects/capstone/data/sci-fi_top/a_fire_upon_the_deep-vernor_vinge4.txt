We would be stronger than the attacking fleet, but we're rotting from the inside Relay is dying. "His voice sharpened, clattering, "but Vrinimi will not die, and a contract is a contract!Tell the Riders, we will pay them somehow, someday.We require plead they fly the mission we contracted.Ravna?""Yes.They hear. ""Then go!"And the voice was gone.Blueshell said, "OOB will be here in two hundred seconds. "Pham Nuwen had calmed, and his breathing was easier.As the two Riders chittered back and forth, Ravna looked around  and suddenly realized that all the death and destruction had been reports from afar.The beach and the sky were almost as placid as ever.The last of the sun's rays had left the waves.The foam was a dim band in the low green light.Here and there, yellow lights glowed in the trees and the farther towers.Yet the alarum had clearly spread.She could hear datasets coming on.Some of the beach fires guttered out, and the figures around them ran into the trees or drifted upwards, headed for farther offices.Now starships floated up from their berths across the sea, falling higher and higher till they glittered in the departed sunlight.It was Relay's last moment of peace.A patch of glowing dark spread across the sky.She gasped at light so twisted it should have gone unseen.It shone more in the back of her head than in her eyes.Afterwards she couldn't think what made it objectively different from blackness."There's another!"said Blueshell.This one was near the Decks' horizon, a blot of darkness perhaps a degree across.The edges were an indistinct bleeding of black into black."What is it?"Ravna was no war freak, but she'd read her share of adventure stories.She knew about antimatter bombs and relativistic KE slugs.From a distance such weapons were bright spots of light, sometimes an orchestrated flickering.Or closer: a world wrecker would glow incandescent across the curve of a planet, splashing the globe itself like a drop of water, but slow, slow.Those were the images her reading had prepared her for.What she saw now was more like a defect in her eyesight than a vision of war.Powers only knew what the Skroderiders saw, but: "Your main transceivers vaping out, I think," said Blueshell."Those are light years out!There's no way we could see  " Another splotch appeared, not even in her field of view.The color floated, placeless.Pham Nuwen spasmed again, but weakly.She had no trouble holding him still, but blood dribbled from his mouth.The back of his shirt was wet with something that stank of decay."OOB will be here in one hundred seconds.Plenty of time, there's plenty of time. "Blueshell rolled back and forth around them, talking reassurance that just showed how nervous he was."Yes, my lady, light years out.And years from now, the flash of their going will light the sky for anyone still alive here.But only a fraction of the vape out is making light.The rest is an ultrawave surge so great that ordinary matter is affected Optic nerves tickled by the overflow So much that your own nervous system becomes a receiver. "He spun around."But don't worry.We're tough and quick.We've squeezed through close spots before. "There was something absurd about a creature with no short term memory bragging up its lightning reflexes.She hoped his skrode was up to this.Greenstalk's voice buzzed painfully loud."Look!"The surf line was drawing back, further than she had ever seen it."The sea is falling!"shouted Greenstalk.Water's edge had pulled back a hundred meters, two hundred.The green limned horizon was dipping."Ship's still fifty seconds out.We'll fly to meet it.Come, Ravna!"Ravna's own courage died cold that second.Grondr had said the Docks would fall!The near sky was crowded now as dozens of people raced for safety.A hundred meters away the sand itself was shifting, an avalanche tilting toward the abyss.She remembered something Old One had said, and suddenly she knew the fliers were making a terrible mistake.The thought cut through her terror."No!Just head for higher ground. "The night was silent no more.A bell like moaning came from the sea.The sound spread.The sunset breeze grew to a gale that twisted the trees toward the water, sending branches and sand sweeping past them.Ravna was still on her knees, her hands pressing down on Pham's limp arms.No breath, no pulse.The eyes stared sightlessly.Old One's gift to her.Damn all the Powers!She grabbed Pham Nuwen under the shoulders and rolled him onto her back.She gagged, almost lost her grip.Underneath his shirt she felt cavities where there should be solid flesh.Something wet and rank dripped around her sides.She struggled up from her knees, half carrying and half dragging the body.Blueshell was shouting, " take hours to roll anywhere. "He drifted off the ground, driving his agrav against the wind.Skrode and Rider twisted drunkenly for an instant and then he was slammed back to the ground, tumbled willy nilly toward the wind's destination, the moaning hole that had been the sea.Greenstalk raced to his seaward side, blocking his progress toward destruction.Blueshell righted himself and the two rolled back toward Ravna.The Rider's voice was faint in the wind: " agrav failing!"And with it the very structure of the Docks.They walked and wheeled their way back from the sucking sea."Find a place to land the OOB. "The tree line was a jagged range of hills now.The landscape changed before their eyes and under her feet.The groaning sound was everywhere, some places so loud it buzzed through Ravna's shoes.They avoided sagging terrain, the sink holes that opened on all sides.The night was dark no more.Whether it was emergency lighting or a side effect of the agrav failure, blue glowed along the holes.Through those holes they saw the cloud decked night of Groundside a thousand kilometers below.The space between was not empty.There were shimmering phantoms: billions of tonnes of water and earth and hundreds of dying fliers.Vrinimi Org was paying the price for building their Docks on agrav instead of inertial orbit.Somehow the three were making progress.Pham Nuwen was almost too heavy to carry/drag; she staggered left and right almost as much as she moved forward.Yet he was lighter that she would have guessed.And that was terrifying in its own way: was even the high ground failing?Most of the agravs died by failure, but some suffered destructive runaway: clumps of trees and earth ripped free from the tops of hillocks and accelerated upwards.The wind shifted back and forth, up and down but it was thinner now, the noise remote.The artificial atmosphere that clothed the Docks would soon be gone.Ravna's pocket pressure suit worked for a few minutes, but now it was fading.In a few minutes it would be as dead as her agravs as dead as she would be.She wondered vaguely how the Blight had managed this.Like the Old One, she would likely die without ever knowing.She saw torch flares; there were ships.Most had boosted for inertial orbits or gone directly into ultradrive, but a few hung over the disintegrating landscape.Blueshell and Greenstalk led the way.The two used their third axles in ways Ravna had never guessed at, lifting and pushing to clamber up slopes that she could scarcely negotiate with Pham's weight dragging from her back.They were on a hilltop, but not for long.This had been part of the office forest.Now the trees stuck out in different directions, like hair on a mangy dog.She felt the ground throbbing beneath her feet.What next?The Skroderiders rolled from one side of the peak to another.They would be rescued here or nowhere.She went to her knees, resting most of Pham's weight on the ground.From here you could see a long ways.The Docks looked like a slowly flapping flag, and every immense whip of the fabric broke fragments loose.As long as some consensus remained among the agrav units, it still had planar aspect.That was disappearing.There were sink holes all around their little knob of forest.On the horizon, Ravna saw the far edge of the Docks detach itself and turn slowly sideways: a hundred kilometers long, ten wide, it swept down on would be rescue ships.Blueshell brushed against her left side, Greenstalk against her right.Ravna twisted, laying some of Pham's weight on the skrode hulls.If all four merged their pressure suits, there would be a few more moments of consciousness."The OOB: I'm flying it down!"he said.Something was coming down.A ship's torch lit the ground blue white, with shadows stark and shifting.It's not a healthy thing to be around a rocket drive hovering in a near one gee field.An hour earlier the maneuver would have been impossible, or a capital offense if accomplished.Now it didn't matter if the torch punched through the Docks or fried a cargo from halfway across the galaxy.Still where could Blueshell land the thing?They were surrounded by sinkholes and moving cliffs.She closed her eyes as the burning light drifted down before them and then dimmed.Blueshell's shout was thin in their shared atmosphere."Let's go together!"She held tight to the Riders, and they crawled/wheeled down from their little hill.The Out of Band II was hovering in the middle of a sinkhole.Its torch was hidden from view, but the glare off the sides of the hole put the ship in sharp silhouette, turned its ultradrive spines into feathery white arcs.A giant moth with glowing wings and just out of reach.If their suits held, they could make it to the edge of the hole.Then what?The spines kept the ship from getting closer than a hundred meters.An able bodied (and crazy) human might try to grab a spine and crawl down it.But Skroderiders had their own brand of insanity: Just as the light  the reflected light  became too much to bear the torch winked out.The OOB fell through the hole.This didn't stop the Riders' advance."Faster!"said Blueshell.And now she guessed what they planned.Quickly for such an awkward jumble of limbs and wheels, they moved up to the edge of the darkened hole.Ravna felt the dirt giving way beneath her feet, and then they were falling.The Decks were hundreds  in places, thousands  of meters thick.They fell past them now, past dim eerie flickers of internal destruction.Then they were through, still falling.For a moment the feeling of wild panic was gone.After all this was simply free fall, a commonplace, and a damnsight more peaceful than the disintegrating Docks.Now it was easy to hold onto the Riders and Pham Nuwen, and even their commensal atmosphere seemed a little thicker than before.There was something to be said for hard vacuum and free fall.Except for an occasional rogue agrav, everything was coming down at the same acceleration, ruins peacefully settling.And four or five minutes from now they would hit Groundside's atmosphere, still falling almost straight downwards Entry velocity only three or four kilometers per second.Would they burn up?Maybe.Flashes pricked bright above the cloud decks.The junk around them was mostly dark, just shadows against the sky show above.But the wreckage directly below was large and regular the OOB, bow on!The ship was falling with them.Every few seconds a trim jet fired, a faint reddish glow.The ship was closing with them.If it had a nose hatch, they would land right on it.Its docking lights flicked on, bright upon them.Ten meters separation.Five.There was a hatch, and open!She could see a very ordinary airlock within  Whatever hit them was big.Ravna saw a vague expanse of plastic rising over her shoulder.The rogue was slowly turning, and it scarcely brushed them  but that was enough.Pham Nuwen was jarred from her grasp.His body was lost in shadow, then suddenly bright lit as the ship's spotlight tracked after him.Simultaneously the air gusted out of Ravna's lungs.They were down to three pocket pressure fields now, failing fields; it was not enough.Ravna could feel consciousness slipping away, her vision tunneling.So close.The Riders unlatched from each other.She grabbed at the skrode hulls and they drifted, strung out, over the ship's lock.Blueshell's skrode jerked against her as the he made fast to the hatch.The jolt twisted her around, whipping Greenstalk upwards.Things were getting dreamy now.Where was panic when you needed it?Hold tight, hold tight, hold tight, sang the little voice, all that was left of consciousness.Bump, jerk.The Riders pushed and pulled at her.Or maybe it was the ship jerking all of them around.They were puppets, dancing off a single string.Deep in the tunnel of her vision, a Rider grabbed at the tumbling figure of Pham Nuwen.Ravna wasn't aware of losing consciousness, but the next she knew she was breathing air and choking on vomit  and was inside the airlock.Solid green walls closed in comfortingly on all sides.Pham Nuwen lay on the far wall, strapped into a first aid canister.His face had a bluish cast.She pushed awkwardly across the lock toward Pham Nuwen's wall.The place was a confused jumble, unlike the passenger and sporting ships she'd been on before.Besides, this was a Rider design.Stickem patches were scattered around the walls; Greenstalk had mounted her skrode on one cluster.They were accelerating, maybe a twentieth of a gee."We're still going down?""Yes.If we hover or rise, we'll crash," into all the junk that still rains from above."Blueshell is trying to fly us out. "They were falling with the rest, but trying to drift out from under  before they hit Groundside.There was an occasional rattle/ping against the hull.Sometimes the acceleration ceased, or shifted in a new direction.Blueshell was actively avoiding the big pieces.Not with complete success.There was long, rasping sound that ended with a bang, and the room turned slowly around her."Brrap!Just lost an ultradrive spine," came Blueshell's voice."Two others already damaged.Please strap down, my lady. "They touched atmosphere a hundred seconds later.The sound was a barely perceptible humming beyond the hull.It was the sound of death for a ship like this.It could no more aerobrake than a dog could jump over the moon.The noise came louder.Blueshell was actually diving, trying to get deep enough to shed the junk that surrounded the ship.Two more spines broke.Then came a long surge of main axis acceleration.Out of Band II arced out of the Docks' death shadow, drove out and out, into inertial orbit.Ravna looked over Blueshell's fronds at the outside windows.They had just passed Groundside's terminator, and were flying an inertial orbit.They were in free fall again, but this trajectory curved back on itself without whacking into big hard things  like Groundside.Ravna didn't know much more about space travel than you'd expect of a frequent passenger and an adventure fan.But it was obvious that Blueshell had pulled off a near miracle.When she tried to thank him, the Rider rolled back and forth across the stick patches, buzzing faintly to himself.Embarrassed?or just Riderly inattentive?Greenstalk spoke, sounding a little shy, a little proud: "Far trading is our life, you know.If we are cautious, life will be mostly safe and placid, but there will be close passages.Blueshell practices all the time, programming his skrode with every wit he can imagine.He is a master. "In everyday life, indecision seemed to dominate the Riders.But in a crunch, they didn't hesitate to bet everything.She wondered how of that was the skrode overriding its rider?"Grump," said Blueshell."I have simply postponed the close passage.I broke several of our drive spines.What if they do not self repair?What do we do then?Everything around Groundside is destroyed.There is junk everywhere out to a hundred radii.Not dense like around the Docks, but of much higher velocity. "You can't inject billions of tonnes of wreckage into buckshot orbits and expect safe navigation."And any second, the Perversion's creatures will be here, eating whoever survives. ""Urk. "Greenstalk's tendrils froze in comical disarray.She chittered to herself for a second."You're right I forgot.I thought we had found an open space, but"  Open space all right, but in a shooting gallery.Ravna looked back at the command deck windows.They were on the dayside now, perhaps five hundred kilometers above Groundside's principal ocean.The space above the hazy blue horizon was free of flash and glow."I don't see any fighting," Ravna said hopefully."Sorry. "Blueshell switched the windows to a more significant view.Most of it was navigation and ultratrace information, meaningless to Ravna.Her eye caught on a medstat: Pham Nuwen was breathing again.The ship's surgeon thought it could save him.But there was also a communication status window; on it, the attack was dreadfully clear.The local net had broken into hundreds of screaming fragments.There were only automatic voices from the planetary surface, and they were calling for medical aid.Grondr had been down there.Somehow she suspected that not even his Marketing ops people had survived.Whatever hit Groundside was even deadlier than the failures at the Docks.In near planetary space, there were a few survivors in ships and fragments of habitats, most on doomed trajectories.Without massive and coordinated help, they would be dead in minutes  hours at the outside.The directors of Vrinimi Org were gone, destroyed before they ever figured out quite what had happened.Go, Grondr had said, go.Out system, there was fighting.Ravna saw message traffic from Vrinimi defense units.Even without control or coordination, some still opposed the Perversion's fleet.The light from their battles would arrive well after the defeat, well after the enemy arrived here in person.How long do we have?Minutes?"Brrap.Look at those traces," said Blueshell."The Perversion has almost four thousand vessels.They are bypassing the defenders. ""But now there is scarcely anyone left out there," said Greenstalk."I hope they're not all dead. ""Not all.I see several thousand ships departing, everyone with the means and any sense. "Blueshell rolled back and forth."Alas!We have the good sense but look at this repair report. "One window spread large, filled with colored patterns that meant less than zip to Ravna."Two spines still broken, unrepairable.Three partially repaired.If they don't heal, we'll be stuck here.This is unacceptable!"His voder voice buzzed up shrilly.Greenstalk drove close to him, and they rattled their fronds at each other.Several minutes passed.When Blueshell spoke Samnorsk again, his voice was quieter."One spine repaired.Maybe, maybe, maybe" He opened a natural view.The OOB was coasting across Groundside's south pole, back into night.Their orbit should take them over the worst of the Docks junk, but the ride was a constant jigging as the ship avoided other debris.The cries of battle horror from out system dwindled.The Vrinimi Organization was one vast, twitching corpse and very soon its killer would come snuffling."Two repaired. "Blueshell became very quiet "Three!Three are repaired!Fifteen seconds to recalibrate and we can jump!"It seemed longer but then all the windows changed to a natural view.Groundside and its sun were gone.Stars and dark stretched all around.Three hours later and Relay was a hundred and fifty light years behind them.The OOB had caught up with the main body of fleeing ships.What with the archives and the tourism, there had been an extraordinary number of interstellar ships at Relay: ten thousand vehicles were spread across the light years around them.But stars were rare this far off the galactic plane and they were at least a hundred hours flying time from the nearest refuge.For Ravna, it was the start of a new battle.She glared across the deck at Blueshell.The Skroderider dithered, its fronds twisting on themselves in a way she had not seen before."See here, my lady Bergsndot, High Point is a lovely civilization, with some bipedal participants.It is safe.It is nearby.You could adapt. "He paused.Reading my expression is he?"But  but if that is not acceptable, we will take you further.Give us a chance to contract the proper cargo, and  and we'll take you all the way back to Sjandra Kei.How about that?""No.You already have a contract, Blueshell.With Vrinimi Organization.The three of us  " and whatever has become of Pham Nuwen " are going to the Bottom of the Beyond. ""I am shaking my head in disbelief!We received a preliminary retainer, true.But now that Vrinimi Org is dead, there is no one to make good on the rest of the agreement.Hence we are free of it also. ""Vrinimi is not dead.You heard Grondr 'Kalir.The Org had  has  branch offices all across the Beyond.The obligation stands. ""On a technicality.We both know that those branches could never make the final payment. "Ravna didn't have a good answer to that."You have an obligation," she said, but without the proper forcefulness.She had never been good at bluster."My lady, are you truly speaking from Org ethics, or from simple humanity?""I " In fact, Ravna had never completely understood Org ethics.That was one reason why she had intended to return to Sjandra Kei after her 'prenticeship, and one reason the Org had dealt cautiously with the human race."It doesn't matter which I speak from!There is a contract.You were happy to honor it when things looked safe.Well, things turned deadly  but that possibility was part of the deal. "Ravna glanced at Greenstalk.She had been silent so far, not even rustling at her mate.Her fronds were tightly held against her central stalk.Maybe  "Listen, there are other reasons besides contract obligation.The Perversion is more powerful than anyone thought.It killed a Power today.And it's operating in the Middle Beyond The Riders have a long history, Blueshell, longer than most races' entire existence.The Perversion may be strong enough to put an end to all of that. "Greenstalk rolled toward her and opened slightly."You  you really think we might find something on that ship at the Bottom, something that could harm a Power among Powers?"Ravna paused."Yes.And Old One himself thought so, just before he died. "Blueshell wrapped even tighter around himself, twisting.In anguish?"My Lady, we are traders.We have lived long and traveled far and survived by minding our own business.No matter what romantics may think, traders do not go on quests.What you ask is impossible, mere Beyonders seeking to subvert a Power. "Yet that was a risk you signed for.But Ravna didn't say it aloud.Perhaps Greenstalk did: her fronds rustled, and Blueshell scrinched even more.Greenstalk was silent for a second, then she did something funny with her axles, bumping free of the stickem.Her wheels spun on nothing as she floated through a slow arc, till she was upside down, her fronds reaching down to brush Blueshell's.They rattled back and forth for almost five minutes.Blueshell slowly untwisted, the fronds relaxing and patting back at his mate.Finally he said."Very well One quest.But mark you!Never another. "Spring came wet and cold, and excruciatingly slow.It had been raining the last eight days.How Johanna wished for something else, even the dark of winter back again.She slogged across mud that had been moss.It was midday; the gloomy light would last another three hours.Scarbutt claimed that without the overcast, they would be seeing a bit of direct sunlight nowadays.Sometimes she wondered if she would ever see the sun again.The castle's great yard was on a hillside.Mud and sullen snow spread down the hill, piled against the wooden buildings.Last summer there had been a glorious view from here.And in the winter, the aurora had spilled green and blue across the snow, glinted on the frozen harbor, and outlined the far hills against the sky.Now: The rain was a close mist; she couldn't even see the city beyond the walls.The clouds were a low and ragged ceiling above her head.She knew there were guards on the stone walls of the castle curtain, but today they must be huddled behind watch slits.Not a single animal, not a single pack was visible.The Tines' world was an empty place compared to Straum  but not like the High Lab either.High Lab was a airless rock orbiting a red dwarf.The Tines' world was alive, moving; sometimes it looked as beautiful and friendly as a holiday resort on Straum.Indeed, Johanna realized that it was kindlier than most worlds the human race had settled  certainly a gentler world than Nyjora, and perhaps as nice as Old Earth.Johanna had reached her bungalow.She paused for a second under its outcurving walls and looked across the courtyard.Yes, it looked a little like medieval Nyjora.But the stories from the Age of Princesses hadn't conveyed the implacable power in such a world: The rain went on for as far as she could see.Without decent technology, even a cold rain could be a deadly thing.So could the wind.And the sea was not something for an afternoon's fun sailing; she thought of surging hillocks of coldness, puckered with rain going on and on.Even the forests around the town were threatening.It was easy to wander into them, but there were no radio finders, no refresh stalls disguised as tree trunks.Once lost, you would simply die.Nyjoran fairy tales had a special meaning for her now: no great imagination was needed to invent the elementals of wind and rain and sea.This was the pretech experience, that even if you had no enemies the world itself could kill you.And she did have plenty of enemies.Johanna pulled open the tiny door and went inside.A pack of Tines was sitting around the fire.It scrambled to its feet and helped Johanna out of her rainjacket.She didn't shrink from the fine toothed muzzles anymore.This was one of her usual helpers; she could almost think of the jaws as hands, deftly pulling the oilskin jacket down her arms and hanging it near the fire.Johanna chucked her boots and pants, and accepted the quilted wrap that the pack "handed" her."Dinner.Now," she said to the pack."Okay. "Johanna settled on a pillow by the fire pit.In fact the Tines were more primitive than the humans on Nyjora: The Tines' world was not a fallen colony.They didn't even have legend to guide them.Sanitation was a sometime thing.Before Woodcarver, Tinish doctors bled their patients/victims She knew now that she was living in the Tines' equivalent of a luxury apartment.The deep polished wood was not a normal thing.The designs painted on the pillars and walls were the result of many hours' labor.Johanna rested her chin on her hands and stared into the flames.She was vaguely aware of the pack prancing around the pit, hanging pots over the fire.This one spoke very little Samnorsk; it wasn't in on Woodcarver's dataset project.Many weeks ago, Scarbutt had asked to move in here  what better way to speed the learning process?Johanna shivered at the memory.She knew the scarred one was just a single member, that the pack that killed Dad had itself died.Johanna understood, but every time she saw "Peregrine", she saw her father's murderer sitting fat and happy, thinking to hide itself behind its three smaller fellows.Johanna smiled into the flames, remembering the whack she had landed on Scarbutt when he made the suggestion.She'd lost control, but it had been worth it.No one else suggested that "friends" should share this house with her.Most evenings they left her alone.And some nights Dad and Mom seemed so near, maybe just outside, waiting for her to notice.Even though she had seen them die, something inside her refused to let them go.Cooking smells slipped past the familiar daydream.Tonight it was meat and beans, with something like onions.Surprise.The stuff smelled good; if there had been any variety, she would have enjoyed it.But Johanna hadn't seen fresh fruit in sixty days.Salted meat and veggies were the only winter fare.If Jefri were here, he'd throw a fit.It was months past since the word came from Woodcarver's spies up north: Jefri had died in the ambush Johanna was getting over it, she really was.And in some ways, being all alone made things simpler.The pack put a plate of meat and beans before her, along with a kind of knife.Oh, well.Johanna grabbed the crooked hilt (bent sideways to be held by Tinish jaws) and dug in.She was almost finished when there was a polite scratching at the door.Her servant gobbled something.The visitor replied, then said in rather good Samnorsk (and a voice that was eerily like her own), "Hello there, my name is Scriber.I would like a small talk, okay?"One of the servant's turned to look at her; the rest were watching the door.Scriber was the one she thought of as Pompous Clown.He'd been with Scarbutt at the ambush, but he was such a fool that she scarcely felt threatened by him."Okay," she said, starting toward the door.Her servant (guard) grabbed crossbows in its jaws, and all five members snaked up the staircase to the loft; there wasn't space for more than one pack down here.The cold and wet blew into the room along with her visitor.Johanna retreated to the other side of the fire while Scriber took off his rain slickers.The pack members shook themselves the way dogs do, a noisy, amusing sight  and you didn't want to be near when it happened.Finally Scriber sauntered over to the fire pit.Under the slickers he wore jackets with the usual stirrups and the open spaces behind the shoulders and at the haunches.But Scriber's appeared to be padded above the shoulders to make his members look heavier than they really were.One of him sniffed at her plate, while the other heads looked this way and that but never directly at her.Johanna looked down at the pack.She still had trouble talking to more than one face; usually she picked on whichever was looking back at her."Well?What did you come to talk about?"One of the heads finally looked at her.It licked its lips."Okay.Yes.I thought to see how do you do?I mean" gobble.Her servant answered from upstairs, probably reporting what kind of mood she was in.Scriber straightened up.Four of his six heads looked at Johanna.His other two members paced back and forth, as if contemplating something important."Look here.You are the only human I know, but I have always been a big student of character.I know you are not happy here  "  Pompous Clown was also master of the obvious.   "and I understand.But we do the best to help you.We are not the bad people who killed your parents and brother. "Johanna put a hand on the low ceiling and leaned forward.You're all thugs; you just happen to have the same enemies I do."I know that, and I am cooperating.You'd still be playing the dataset's kindermode if it weren't for me.I've shown you the reading courses; if you guys have any brains, you'll have gunpowder by summer. "The Oliphaunt was an heirloom toy, a huggable favorite thing she should have outgrown years ago.But there was history in it  stories of the queens and princesses of the Dark Ages, and how they had struggled to triumph over the jungles, to rebuild the cities and then the spaceships.Half hidden on obscure reference paths there were also hard numbers, the history of technology.Gunpowder was one of the easiest things.When the weather cleared up, there would be some prospecting expeditions; Woodcarver had known about sulfur, but didn't have quantities in town.Making cannon would be harder.But then "Then your enemies will be killed.Your people are getting what they want from me.So what's your complaint?""Complaint?"Pompous Clown's heads bobbed up and down in alternation.Such distributed gestures seemed to be the equivalent of facial expressions, though Johanna hadn't figured many of them out.This one might mean embarrassment."I have no complaint.You are helping us, I know.But, but  " Three of his members were pacing around now."It's just that I see more than most people, perhaps a little like Woodcarver did in oldendays.I am a  I've seen your word for it  a 'dilettante'.You know, a person who studies all things and who is talented at everything.I am only thirty years old, but I have read almost every book in the world, and  " the heads bowed, perhaps in shyness? "I'm even planning to write one, perhaps the true story of your adventure. "Johanna found herself smiling.Most often she saw the Tines as barbarian strangers, inhuman in spirit as well as form.But if she closed her eyes, she could almost imagine that Scriber was a fellow Straumer.Mom had a few friends just as brainless and innocently self convinced as this one, men and women with a hundred grandiose projects that would never ever amount to anything.Back on Straum, they had been boring perils that she avoided.Now well, Scriber's foolishness was almost like being back home again."You're here to study me for your book?"More alternating nods."Well, yes.And also, I wanted to talk to you about my other plans.I've always been something of an inventor, you see.I know that doesn't mean much now.It seems that everything that can be invented is already in Dataset.I've seen many of my best ideas there. "He sighed, or made the sound of a sigh.Now he was imitating one of the pop science voices in the dataset.Sound was the easiest thing for the Tines; it could be darn confusing."In any case, I was just wondering how to improve some of those ideas  " four of Scriber's members bellied down on the bench by the fire pit; it looked like he was settling in for a long conversation.His other two walked around the pit to give her a stack of paper threaded with brass hoops.While one on the other side of the fire continued to talk, the two carefully turned the pages and pointed at where she should look.Well, he did have plenty of ideas: Tethered birds to hoist flying boats, giant lenses that would concentrate the sun's light on enemies and set them afire.From some of the pictures, it appeared he thought the atmosphere extended beyond the moon.Scriber explained each idea in numbing detail, pointing at the drawings and patting her hands enthusiastically."So you see the possibilities?My unique slant combined with the proven inventions in Dataset.Who knows where it could lead?"Johanna giggled, overcome by the vision of Scriber's giant birds hauling kilometer wide lenses to the moon.He seemed to take the sound for approval."Yes!It's brilliant, okay?My latest idea, I never would have thought it except for Dataset.This 'radio', it projects sound very far and fast, okay?Why not combine it with the power of our Tinish thoughts?A pack could think as one even spread across hundreds of, um, kilometers. "Now that almost made sense!But if gunpowder took months to make  even given the exact formula  how many decades would it be before the packs had radio?Scriber was an immense fountain of half baked ideas.She let his words wash over her for more than an hour.It was insanity, but less alien than most of what she had endured this last year.Finally he seemed to run down; there were longer pauses and he asked her opinion more often.Finally he said, "Well, that was certainly fun, okay?""Unh, yes, fascinating. ""I knew you would like it.You're just like my people, I really think.You're not all angry, not all the time"  "Just what do you mean by that?"Johanna pushed a soft muzzle away and stood.The dogthing rocked back on its haunches to look up at her."I, well you have much to hate, I know.But you seem so angry at us all the time, and we're the ones who are trying to help you!After the day work you stay here, you don't want to talk with people  though now I see that was our fault.You wanted us to come here but were too proud to say it.I have these insights into character, you see.My friend, the one you call Scarbutt: he is truly a nice fellow.I know I can tell you that honestly, and that as my new friend you will believe.He would very much like to come to visit you, too urk. "Johanna walked slowly around the fire pit, forcing the two members to back away from her.All of Scriber was looking up at her now, the necks arching around one another, the eyes wide."I'm not like you.I don't need your talk, or your stupid ideas. "She threw Scriber's notebook into the pit.Scriber leaped to the fire's edge, desperately reached for the burning notes.He pulled most of them back and clutched them to his chests.Johanna kept walking toward him, kicking at his legs.Scriber retreated, backing and sprawling."Stupid, dirty, butchers.I'm not like you. "She slapped her hand on a ceiling beam."Humans don't like to live like animals.We don't adopt killers.You tell Scarbutt, you tell him.If he ever comes by for a friendly chat, I I'll smash in his head; I'll smash in all of them!"Scriber was backed into the wall now.His heads turned wildly this way and that.He was making plenty of noise.Some of it was Samnorsk, but too high pitched to understand.One of his mouths found the door pole.He pushed open the door, and all six members raced into the twilight, their rain slickers forgotten.Johanna knelt and stuck her head through the doorway.The air was a wind driven mist.In an instant, her face was so cold and wet that she couldn't feel the tears.Scriber was six shadows in the darkening grayness, shadows that raced down the hillside, sometimes tumbling in their haste.In a second he was gone.There was nothing but the vague forms of nearby cabins, and the yellow light that spilled out around her from the fire.Strange.Right after the ambush, she had felt terror.The Tines had been unstoppable killers.Then, on the boat, when she smashed Scarbutt it had been so wonderful: the whole pack collapsed, and suddenly she knew that she could fight back, that she could break their bones.She didn't have to be at their mercy Tonight she had learned something more.Even without touching them, she could hurt them.Some of them, anyway.Her dislike alone had undone Pompous Clown.Johanna backed into the smoky warmth and shut the door.She should feel triumph.Scriber Jaqueramaphan didn't tell anyone about his meeting with the Two Legs.Of course, Vendacious's guard had overheard everything.The fellow might not speak much Samnorsk, but he had surely gotten the drift of the argument.People would hear about it eventually.He moped around the castle for a few days, spent a number of hours hunched over the remains of his notebook, trying to recreate the diagrams.It would be a a while before he attended any more sessions with Dataset, especially when Johanna was around.Scriber knew he seemed brash to the outside world, but in fact it had taken a lot of courage to walk in on Johanna like that.He knew his ideas had genius, but all his life unimaginative people had been telling him otherwise.In most ways Scriber was a very fortunate person.He had been born a fission pack in Rangathir, at the eastern edge of the Republic.His parent had been a wealthy merchant.Jaqueramaphan had some of his parent's traits, but the dull patience necessary for day to day business work had been lost to him.His sibling pack more than retained that faculty; the family business grew, and  in the first years  his sib didn't begrudge Scriber his share of the wealth.From his earliest days, Scriber had been an intellectual.He read everything: natural history, biography, brood kenning.In the end he had the largest library in Rangathir, more than two hundred books.Even then Scriber had tremendous ideas, insights which  if properly executed  would have made them the wealthiest merchants in all the eastern provinces.Alas, bad luck and his sib's lack of imagination had doomed his early ideas.In the end, his sib bought out the business, and Jaqueramaphan moved to the Capital.It was all for the best.By this time Scriber had fleshed himself out to six members; he needed to see more of the world.Besides there were five thousand books in the library there, the experience of all history and all the world!His own notebooks became a library in themselves.Yet still the packs at the university had no time for him.His outline for a summation of natural history was rejected by all the stationers, though he paid to have small parts of it published.It was clear that success in the world of action was necessary before his ideas could get the attention they deserved, hence his spy mission; Parliament itself would thank him when he returned with the secrets of Flenser's Hidden Island.That was almost a year ago.What had happened since  with the flying house and Johanna and Dataset  went beyond his wildest dreams (and Scriber granted that those dreams were already pretty extreme).The library in Dataset contained millions of books.With Johanna to help him polish his ideas, they would sweep Flenserism from the face of the world.They would regain her flying house.Not even the sky would be a limit.So to have her throw it all back at him it made him wonder about himself.Maybe she was just mad at him for trying to explain Peregrine.She would like Peregrine if she let herself; he was sure of it.But then again   maybe his ideas just weren't that good, at least by comparison with humans'.That thought left him pretty low.But he finished redrawing the diagrams, and even got some new ideas.Maybe he should get some more silkpaper.Peregrine stopped by and persuaded him to go into town.Jaqueramaphan had made up a dozen explanations why he wasn't participating in the sessions with Johanna anymore.He tried out two or three as he and Peregrine descended Castle Street toward the harbor.After a minute or two, his friend turned a head back."It's okay, Scriber.When you feel like it, we'd like to have you back. "Scriber had always been a very good judge of attitude; in particular, he could tell when he was being patronized.He must have scowled a little, because Peregrine went on."I mean it.Even Woodcarver has been asking about you.She likes your ideas. "Comforting lies or not, Scriber brightened."Really?"The Woodcarver of today was a sad case, but the Woodcarver of the history books was one of Jaqueramaphan's great heroes."No one's mad at me?""Well, Vendacious is a bit peeved.Being responsible for the Two Legs' safety makes him very nervous.But you only tried something we've all wanted to do. ""Yeah. "Even if there had been no Dataset, even if Johanna Olsndot had not come from the stars, she would still be the most fascinating creature in the world: a pack equivalent mind in a single body.You could walk right up to her, you could touch her, without the least confusion.It was frightening at first, but all of them quickly felt the attraction.For packs, closeness had always meant mindlessness  whether for sex or battle.Imagine being able to sit by the fire with a friend and carry on an intelligent conversation!Woodcarver had a theory that the Two Legs' civilization might be innately more effective than any Packish one, that collaboration was so easy for humans that they learned and built much faster than packs could.The only problem with that theory was Johanna Olsndot.If Johanna was a normal human, it is was a surprise that the race could cooperate on anything.Sometimes she was friendly  usually in the sessions with Woodcarver.She seemed to realize that Woodcarver was frail and failing.More often she was patronizing, sarcastic, and seemed to think the best they could do for her insulting And sometimes she was like last night."How goes it with Dataset?"he asked after a moment.Peregrine shrugged."About like before.Both Woodcarver and I can read Samnorsk pretty well now.Johanna has taught us  me via Woodcarver, I should say  how to use most of Dataset's powers.There's so much there that will change the world.But for now we have to concentrate on making gunpowder and cannons.It's that, the actual doing, that's going slow. "Scriber nodded knowingly.That had been the central problem in his life too."Anyway, if we can do all that by midsummer, maybe we can face Flenser's army and recapture the flying house before next winter. "Peregrine made a grin that stretched from face to face."And then, my friend, Johanna can call her people for rescue and we'll have all our lives to study the outsiders.I may pilgrimage to worlds around other stars. "It was an idea they had talked of before.Peregrine had thought of it even before Scriber.They turned off Castle Street onto Edgerow.Scriber was feeling more enthusiastic about visiting the stationer's; there must be some way he could help.He looked around with an interest that had been lacking the last few days.Woodcarvers was a fair sized city, almost as big as Rangathir  maybe twenty thousand packs lived within its walls and in the homes immediately around.This day was a bit colder than the last few, but it wasn't raining.A cold, clean wind swept the market street, carrying faint smells of mildew and sewage, of spices and fresh sawn wood.Dark clouds hung low, misting the hills around the harbor.Spring was definitely in the air.Scriber kicked playfully at the slush along the curb.Peregrine led them to a side street.The place was jammed, strangers getting as close as seven or eight yards.The stalls at the stationer's were even worse.The felt dividers weren't that thick, and there seemed to be more interest in literature at Woodcarvers than any place Scriber had ever been.He could hardly hear himself think as he haggled with the stationer.The merchant sat on a raised platform with thick padding; he wasn't much bothered by the racket.Scriber kept his heads close together, concentrating on the prices and the product.From his past life, he was pretty good at this sort of thing.Eventually he got his paper, and at a decent price."Let's go back on Packweal," he said.That was the long way, through the center of the market.When he was in a good mood, Scriber rather liked crowds; he was a great student of people.Woodcarvers was not as cosmopolitan as some cities by the Long Lakes, but there were traders from all over.He saw several packs wearing the bonnets of a tropic collective.At one intersection a redjackets from East Home was chatting cozily with a labormaster.When packs came this close, and in these numbers, the world seemed to teeter on the edge of a choir.Each person hung near to himself, trying to keep his own thoughts intact.It was hard to walk without stumbling over your own feet.And sometimes the background thought sounds would surge, a moment where several packs would somehow synchronize.Your consciousness wavered and for an instant you were one with many, a superpack that might be a god.Jaqueramaphan shivered.That was the essential attraction of the Tropics.The crowds there were mobs, vast group minds as stupid as they were ecstatic.If the stories were true, some of the southern cities were nonstop orgies.They had roamed the marketplace almost an hour when it hit him.Scriber shook his heads abruptly.He turned and walked in lockstep off Packweal, and up a side street.Peregrine followed, "Is the crowd too much?"he asked."I just had an idea," said Scriber.That wasn't unusual in a close crowd, but this was a very interesting idea He said nothing more for several minutes.The side street climbed steeply, then jinked back and forth across Castle Hill.The upslope side was lined with burghers' homes.On the harbor side, they were looking out over the steep tile roofs of houses on the next switchback down.These were large homes, elegant with rosemaling.Only a few had shops on the street.Scriber slowed down and spread out enough that he wasn't stepping on himself.He saw now that he'd been quite wrong in trying to contribute creative expertise to Johanna.There was simply too much invention in Dataset.But they still needed him, Johanna most of all.The problem was, they didn't know it yet.Finally he said to Peregrine, "Haven't you wondered that the Flenserists haven't attacked the city?You and I embarrassed the Lords of Hidden Island more than ever in their history.We hold the keys to their total defeat. "Johanna and Dataset.Peregrine hesitated."Hmm.I assumed their army wasn't up to it.I should think if they were, they'd have knocked over Woodcarvers long before. ""Perhaps, but at great cost.Now the cost is worth it. "He gave Peregrine a serious look."No, I think there's another reason They have the flying house, but they have no idea how to use it.They want Johanna back alive  almost as much as they want to kill all of us. "Peregrine made a bitter sound."If Steel hadn't been so eager to massacre everything on two legs, he could have had all sorts of help. ""True, and the Flenserists must know that.I'll bet they've always had spies among the townspeople here, but now more than ever.Did you see all the East Home packs?"East Home was a hotbed of Flenser sentiment.Even before the Movement, they had been a hard folk, routinely sacrificing pups that didn't meet their brood standards."One anyway.Talking to a labormaster. ""Right.Who knows what's coming in disguised as special purpose packs?I'd bet my life they're planning to kidnap Johanna.If they guess what we're planning with her, they may just try to kill her.Don't you see?We must alert Woodcarver and Vendacious, organize the people to watch for spies. ""You noticed all this on one walk through Packweal?"There was wonder or disbelief in his voice, Scriber couldn't tell which."Well, um, no.The inspiration wasn't anything so direct.But it stands to reason, don't you think?"They walked in silence for several minutes.Up here the wind was stronger, and the view more spectacular.Where there wasn't the sea, forest spread endless gray and green.Everything was very peaceful because this was a game of stealth.Fortunately Scriber had a talent for such games.After all, hadn't it been the very Political Police of the Republic who commissioned him to survey Hidden Island?It had taken him several tendays of patient persuasion, but in the end they had been enthusiastic.Anything you can discover we would be most happy to review.Those were their exact words.Peregrine waffled around the road, seemingly very taken aback by Scriber's suggestion.Finally he said, "I think there is something you should know, something that must remain an absolute secret. ""Upon my soul!Peregrine, I do not blab secrets. "Scriber was a little hurt  at the lack of trust, and also that the other might have discovered something he had not.The second should not bother him.He had guessed that Peregrine and Woodcarver were into each other.No telling what she might have confided, or what might have leaked across."Okay You've tripped onto something that should not be noised about.You know Vendacious is in charge of Woodcarvers security?""Of course. "That was implicit in the office of Lord Chamberlain."And considering the number of outsiders wandering around, I can't say he's doing a very good job. ""In fact, he's doing a marvelously effective job.Vendacious has agents right at the top at Hidden Island  one step removed from Lord Steel himself. "Scriber felt his eyes widening."Yes, you understand what that means.Through Vendacious, Woodcarver knows for a certainty everything their high council plans.With clever misinformation, we can lead the Flenserists around like froghens at a thinning.Next to Johanna herself, this may be Woodcarver's greatest advantage. ""I  " I had no idea."So the incompetent local security is just a cover. ""Not exactly.It's supposed to look solid and intelligent, but with just enough exploitable weakness so the Movement will postpone a frontal attack in favor of espionage. "He smiled."I think Vendacious will be very taken aback to hear your critique. "Scriber gave a weak laugh.He was flattered and boggled at the same time.Vendacious must count as the greatest spymaster of the age  yet he, Scriber Jaqueramaphan, had almost seen through him.Scriber was mostly quiet the rest of the way back to the castle, but his mind was racing.Peregrine was more right than he knew; secrecy was vital.Unnecessary discussion  even between old friends  must be avoided.Yes!He would offer his services to Vendacious.His new role might keep him in the background, but it was where he could make the greatest contribution.And eventually even Johanna would see how helpful he could be.Down the well of the night.Even when Ravna wasn't looking out the windows, that was the image in her mind.Relay was far off the galactic disk.The OOB was descending toward that disk  and ever deeper into slowness.But they had escaped.The OOB was crippled, but they had left Relay at almost fifty light years per hour.Each hour they were lower in the Beyond and the computation time for the microjumps increased, and their pseudovelocity declined.Nevertheless, they were making progress.They were deep into the Middle of the Beyond now.And there was no sign of pursuit, thank goodness.Whatever had brought the Blight to Relay, it had not been specific knowledge of the OOB.Hope.Ravna felt it growing in her.The ship's medical automation claimed that Pham Nuwen could be saved, that there was brain activity.The terrible wounds in his back had been Old One's implants, organic machinery that had made Pham close linked to Relay's local network  and thence to the Power above.And when that Power died somehow the gear in Pham became a putrescent ruin.So Pham the person should still exist.Pray he still exists.The surgeon thought it would be three days before his back was healed enough to attempt resuscitation.In the meantime Ravna was learning more about the apocalypse that had swept over her.Every twenty hours, Greenstalk and Blueshell jigged the ship sideways a few light years, into some major trunk line of the Known Net to soak up the News.It was a common practice on any voyage of more than a few days; an easy way for merchants and travelers to keep track of events that might affect their success at voyage's end.According to the News (that is, according to the vast majority of the opinions expressed), the fall of Relay was complete.Oh, Grondr.Oh Egravan and Sarale.Are you dead or owned now?Parts of the Known Net were temporarily out of contact; some of the extra galactic links might not be replaced for years.For the first time in millennia, a Power was known to have been murdered.There were tens of thousands of claims about the motive for the attack and tens of thousands of predictions about what would happen next.Ravna had the ship filter the avalanche, trying to distill the essence of the speculations.The one coming from Straumli Realm itself made as much sense as any: the Perversion's thralls gloated solemnly about the new era, the marriage of a Transcendent being with races of the Beyond.If Relay could be destroyed  if a Power could be murdered  then nothing could stop the spread of victory.Some senders thought that Relay was the ancestral target of whatever had perverted Straumli Realm.Maybe the attack was just the tail end of some long ago war, a misbegotten tragedy for the descendants of forgotten races.If so, then the thralls at Straumli Realm might just wither away and the original human culture there reappear.A number of items suggested that the attack had been aimed at stealing Relay's archives, but only one or two claimed that the Blight sought to recover an artifact, or prevent the Relayers from recovering one.Those assertions came from chronic theorizers, the sort of civilizations that get surcharged by newsgroup automation.Nevertheless, Ravna looked through those messages carefully.None of them suggested an artifact in the Low Beyond; if anything, they claimed the Blight was searching for something in the High Beyond or Low Transcend.There was network traffic coming out of the Blight.The high protocol messages were ignored by all but the suicidal, and no one was getting paid to forward any of it.Yet horror and curiosity spread some of the messages far.There was the Blighter "video": almost four hundred seconds of pan sensual data with no compression.That incredibly expensive message might be the most forwarded hog in all Net history.Blueshell held the OOB on the trunk path for nearly two days to receive the whole thing.The Perversion's thralls all appeared to be human.About half the news items coming out of the Realm were video evocations, though none this long; all showed human speakers.Ravna watched the big one again and again: She even recognized the speaker.Ovn Nilsndot had been Straumli Realm's champion trael runner.He had no title now, and probably no name.Nilsndot spoke from an office that might have been a garden.If Ravna stepped to the side of the image, she could see over his shoulder to ground level.The city there looked like the Straumli Main of record.Years ago, Ravna and her sister had dreamed about that city, the heart of mankind's adventure into the Transcend.The central square had been a replica of the Field of Princesses on Nyjora, and the immigration advertising claimed that no matter how far the Straumers went, the fountain in the Field would always flow, would always show their loyalty to humankind's beginnings.There was no fountain now, and Ravna felt deadness behind Nilsndot's gaze."This one speaks as the Power that Helps," said the erstwhile hero."I want all to see what I can do for even a third rate civilization.Look upon my Helping" The viewpoint swung skywards.It was sunset, and the ranked agrav structures hung against the light, megameter upon megameter.It was a more grandiose use of the agrav material than Ravna had ever seen, even on the Docks.Certainly no world in the Middle Beyond could ever afford to import the material in such quantities."What you see above me is just the work barracks for the construction that I will soon begin in the Straumli system.When complete, five star systems will be a single habitat, their planets and excess stellar mass distributed to support life and technology as never before seen at these depths  and as rarely seen in the Transcend itself. "The view returned to Nilsndot, a single human, mouthpiece for a god."Some of you may rebel against idea of dedicating yourselves to me.In the long run it does not matter.The symbiosis of my Power with the hands of races in the Beyond is more than any can resist.But I speak now to diminish your fear.What you see in Straumli Realm is as much a joy as a wonder.Never again will races in the Beyond be left behind by transcendence.Those who join me  and all will join eventually  will be part of the Power.You will have access to imports from across the Top and Lower Transcend.You will reproduce beyond the limits your own technology could sustain.You will absorb all that oppose me.You will bring the new stability. "The third or fourth time she watched the item, Ravna tried to ignore the words, concentrate on Nilsndot's expression, comparing it to speeches she had in her personal dataset.There was a difference; it wasn't her imagination.The creature she watched was soul dead.Somehow, the Blight didn't care that that was obvious maybe it wasn't obvious except to human viewers, and they were a vanishingly small fraction of the audience.The viewpoint closed in on Nilsndot's ordinary dark face, his ordinary violet eyes:  "Some of you may wonder how all this is possible, and why billions of years of anarchy have passed without such help from a Power.The answer is   complex.Like many sensible developments, this one has a high threshold.On one side of that threshold, the development appears impossibly unlikely; on the other, inevitable.The symbiosis of the Helping depends on efficient, high bandwidth communication between myself and the beings I Help.Creatures such as the one now speaking my words must respond as quickly and faithfully as a hand or a mouth.Their eyes and ears must report across light years.This has been hard to achieve  especially since the system must essentially be in place before it can function.But, now that the symbiosis exists, progress will come much faster.Almost any race can be modified to receive Help. "Almost any race can be modified.The words came from a familiar face, and in Ravna's birth language but the origin was monstrously far away.There was plenty of analysis.A whole news group had been formed: Threat of the Blight was spawned from Threats Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group, and Close Coupled Automation.These days it was busier than any five other groups.In this part of the galaxy, a significant fraction of all message traffic belonged to the new group.More bits were sent analyzing poor Ovn Nilsndot's mouthing than had been in the original.Judging from the flames and contradictions, the signal to noise ratio was very low:   Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Acquileron Triskweline, SjK units  From: Khurvark University [Claimed to be

Distribution:  War Trackers Interest Group, Threat of the Blight  Date: 8.68 days since Fall of Relay  Text of message:  Khurvark University thinks the Blight is a fraud because elements of the former regime have survived on Straum.There is another explanation.Suppose the Blight is indeed a Power, and that its claims of effective symbiosis are generally true.That means that the creature being "Helped" is no more than a remotely controlled device, his brain simply a local processor supporting the communication.Would you want to be helped like that?My question isn't completely rhetorical; the readership is wide enough that there may be some of you who would answer "yes".However, the vast majority of naturally evolved, sentient beings would be revolted by the notion.Surely the Blight knows this.My guess is that the Blight is not a fraud  but that the notion of surviving culture in Straumli Realm is.Subtly, the Blight wanted to convey the impression that only some are directly enslaved, that cultures as a whole will survive.Combine that with Blight's claim that not all races can be teleoperated.We're left with the subtext that immense riches are available to races that associate themselves with this Power, yet the biological and intellectual imperatives of these races will still be satisfied.So, the question remains.Just how complete is the Blight's control over conquered races?I don't know.There may not be any self aware minds left in the Blight's Beyond, only billions of teleoperated devices.One thing is clear: The Blight needs something from us that it cannot yet take.And so it went.Tens of thousands of messages, hundreds of points of view.It was not called the Net of a Million Lies for nothing.Ravna talked with Blueshell and Greenstalk about it every day, trying to put it together, trying to decide which interpretation to believe.The Riders knew humans well, but even they weren't sure of the deadness in Ovn Nilsndot's face.And Greenstalk knew humans well enough to see that there was no answer that would comfort Ravna.She rolled back and forth in front of the News window, finally reached a frond out to touch the human."Perhaps Sir Pham can say, once he is well. "Blueshell was bustling, clinical."If you're right, that means that somehow the Blight doesn't care what humans and those close to humans know.In a way that makes sense, but" His voder buzzed absentmindedly for a moment."I mistrust this message.Four hundred seconds of broad band, so rich that it gives full sense imagery for many different races.That's an enormous amount of information, and no compression whatsoever Maybe it's sweetened bait, forwarded by us poor Beyonders back to our every nest. "That suspicion had been in the News too.But there were no obvious patterns in the message, and nothing that talked to network automation.Such subtle poison might work at the Top of the Beyond, but not down here.And that left a simpler explanation, one that would make perfect sense even on Nyjora or Old Earth: the video masked a message to agents already in place.Vendacious was well known to the people of Woodcarvers  but for mostly the wrong reasons.He was about a century old, the fusion offspring of Woodcarver on two of his strategists.In his early decades, Vendacious had managed the city's wood mills.Along the way he devised some clever improvements on the waterwheel.Vendacious had had his own romantic entanglements  mostly with politicians and speech makers.More and more, his replacement members inclined him toward public life.For the last thirty years he had been one of the strongest voices on Woodcarvers Council; for the last ten, Lord Chamberlain.In both roles, he had stood for the guilds and for fair trade.There were rumors that if Woodcarver should ever abdicate or wholly die, Vendacious would be the next Lord of Council.Many thought that might be the best that could be made of such a disaster  though Vendacious's pompous speeches were already the bane of the Council.That was the public's view of Vendacious.Anyone who understood the ways of security would also guess that the chamberlain managed Woodcarver's spies.No doubt he had dozens of informants in the mills and on the docks.But now Scriber knew that even that was just a cover.Imagine  having agents in the Flenser inner circle, knowing the Flenser plans, their fears, their weaknesses, and being able to manipulate them!Vendacious was simply incredible.Ruefully, Scriber must acknowledge the other's stark genius.And yet this knowledge did not guarantee victory.Not all the Flenser schemes could be directly managed from the top.Some of the enemy's low level operations might proceed unknown and quite successfully and it would only take a single arrow to totally kill Johanna Olsndot.Here was where Scriber Jaqueramaphan could prove his value.He asked to move into the castle curtain, on the third floor.No problem getting permission; his new quarters were smaller, the walls rudely quilted.A single arrow loop gave an uninspired view across the castle grounds.For Scriber's new purpose, the room was perfect.Over the next few days, he took to lurking in the promenades.The main walls were laced with tunnels, fifteen inches wide by thirty tall.Scriber could get almost anywhere in the curtain without being seen from outside.He padded single file from one tunnel to the next, emerging for a few moments on a rampart to flit from merlon to embrasure to merlon, a head poking out here, a head poking out there.Of course he ran into guards, but Jaqueramaphan was cleared to be in the walls and he had studied the guards' routine.They knew he was around, but Scriber was confident they had no idea of the extent of his effort.It was hard, cold work, but worth the effort.Scriber's great goal in life was to do something spectacular and valuable.The problem was, most of his ideas were so deep that other packs  even people he respected immensely  didn't understand.That had been the problem with Johanna.Well, after a few more days he could go to Vendacious and then  As he peeked around corners and through arrow slots, two of Scriber's members huddled down, taking notes.After ten days, he had enough to impress even Vendacious.Vendacious's official residence was surrounded by rooms for assistants and guards.It was not the place to make a secret offer.Besides, Scriber had had bad luck with the direct approach before.You could wait days for an appointment, and the more patient you were, the more you followed the rules, the more the bureaucrats considered you a nonentity.But Vendacious was sometimes alone.There was this turret on the old wall, on the forest side of the castle Late on the eleventh day of his investigation, Scriber stationed himself on that turret and waited.An hour passed.The wind eased.Heavy fog washed in from the harbor.It oozed up the old wall like slow moving sea foam.Everything became very, very quiet  the way it always does in a thick fog.Scriber nosed moodily around the turret platform; it really was decrepit.The mortar crumbled under his claws.It felt like you could pull some of the stones right out of the wall.Damn.Maybe Vendacious was going to break the pattern and not come up here today.But Scriber waited another half hour and his patience paid off.He heard the click of steel on the spiral stairs.There was no sound of thought; it was just too foggy for that.A minute passed.The trapdoor popped up and a head stuck through.Even in the fog, Vendacious's surprise was a fierce hiss."Peace, sir!It is only I, loyal Jaqueramaphan. "The head came further out."What would a loyal citizen be doing up here?""Why, I am here to see you," Scriber said, laughing, "at this, your secret office.Come on up, sir.With this fog, there is enough room for both of us. "One after another, Vendacious's members hoisted themselves through the trapdoor.Some barely made it, their knives and jewelry catching on the door frame; Vendacious was not the slimmest of packs.The security chief ranged himself along the far side of the turret, a posture that bespoke suspicion.He was nothing like the pompous, patronizing pack of their public encounters.Scriber grinned to himself.He certainly had the other's attention."Well?"Vendacious said in a flat voice."Sir.I wish to offer my services.I believe that my very presence here shows I can be of value to Woodcarver's security.Who but a talented professional could have determined that you use this place as your secret den?"Vendacious seemed to untense a little.He smiled wryly."Who indeed?I come here precisely because this part of the old wall can't be seen from anywhere in the castle.Here I can commune with the hills, and be free of bureaucratic trivia. "Jaqueramaphan nodded."I understand, sir.But you are wrong in one detail. "He pointed past the security chief."You can't see it through all this fog, but on the harbor side of the castle there is a single spot that has a line of sight on your turret. ""So?Who could see much from  ah, the eye tools you brought from the Republic!""Exactly. "Scriber reached into a pocket and brought out a telescope."Even from across the yard, I could recognize you. "The eye tools could have made Scriber famous.Woodcarver and Scrupilo had been enchanted by them.Unfortunately, honesty had required to him to admit that he bought the devices from an inventor in Rangathir.Never mind that it was he who recognized the value of the invention, that it was he who used it to help rescue Johanna.When they discovered that he did not know quite how the lenses worked, they had accepted his gift of one and turned to their own glass makers.Oh well, he was still the best eye tool user in this part of the world."It's not just you I've been watching, my lord.That's been the smallest part of my investigation.Over the last ten days I've spent many hours on the castle walks. "Vendacious's lips quirked."Indeed. ""I daresay not many noticed me, and I was very careful that no one saw me using the eye tool.In any case," he pulled his book from another pocket, "I've compiled extensive notes.I know who goes where and when during almost all the hours of light.You can imagine the power of my technique during the summer!"He set the book on the floor and slid it toward Vendacious.After a moment, the other reached a member forward and dragged it toward himself.He didn't seem very enthusiastic."Please understand, sir.I know that you tell Woodcarver what goes on in the highest Flenser councils.Without your sources we would be helpless against those lords, but  "  "Who told you such things?"Scriber gulped.Brazen it out.He grinned weakly."No one had to tell me.I'm a professional, like yourself; and I know how to keep a secret.But think: there may be others of my ability within the castle, and some might be traitors.You might never hear of them from your high placed sources.Think of the damage they could do.You need my help.With my approach, you can keep track of everyone.I would be happy to train a corps of investigators.We could even operate in the city, watching from the market towers. "The security chief sidled around the parapet; he kicked idly at stones in the rotted mortar."The idea has its attractions.Mind you, I think we have all Flenser's agents identified; we feed them well with lies.It's interesting to hear the lies come back from our sources up there. "He laughed shortly, and glanced over the parapet, thinking."But you're right.If we are missing anyone with access to the Two legs or Dataset it could be disastrous. "He turned more heads at Scriber."You've got a deal.I can get you four or five people to, ah, train in your methods. "Scriber couldn't control his expression; he almost bounced in enthusiasm, all eyes on Vendacious."You won't regret this, sir!"Vendacious shrugged."Probably not.Now, how many others have you told about your investigation?We'll want to bring them in, swear them to secrecy. "Scriber drew himself up."My Lord!I told you that I am a professional.I have kept this completely to myself, waiting for this conversation. "Vendacious smiled and relaxed to an almost genial posture."Excellent.Then we can begin. "Maybe it was Vendacious's voice  a trifle too loud  or maybe it was some small sound behind him.Whatever the reason, Scriber turned a head from the other and saw swift shadows coming over the forest side of the parapet.Too late he heard the attacker's mind noise.Arrows hissed, and fire burned through his Phan's throat.He gagged, but kept himself together and raced around the turret toward Vendacious."Help me!"The scream was a waste of speech.Scriber knew, even before the other drew his knives and backed away.Vendacious stood clear as his assassin jumped into Scriber's midst.Rational thought dimmed in a frenzy of noise and slashing pain.Tell Peregrine!Tell Johanna!The butchering continued for timeless instants and then  Part of him was drowning in sticky red.Part of him was blinded.Jaquerama's thought came in ragged fragments.At least one of him was dead: Phan lay beheaded in a spreading pool of blood.It steamed in the cold air.Pain and cold and drowning, choking tell Johanna.The assassin and his boss had retreated from him.Vendacious.Security chief.Traitor in chief.Tell Johanna.They stood quietly watching him bleed to death.Too prissy to mess their thoughts with his.They'd wait.They'd wait till his mind noise dimmed, then finish the job.Quiet.So quiet.The killers' distant thoughts.Sounds of gagging, moaning.No one would ever know  Almost all gone.Ja stared dumbly at the two strange packs.One came toward him, steel claws on its feet, blades in its mouth.No!Ja jumped up, slipping and skidding on the wet.The pack lunged, but Ja was already standing on the parapet.He leaped backwards and fell and fell   and shattered on rocks far below.Ja pulled himself away from the wall.There was pain across his back, then numbness.Where am I?Where am I?Fog everywhere.High above him there were muttering voices.Memories of knives and tines floated in his small mind, all jumbled.Tell Johanna!He remembered something from before.A hidden trail through deep brush.If he went that way far enough, he would find Johanna.Ja dragged himself slowly up the path.Something was wrong with his rear legs; he couldn't feel them.Tell Johanna.Johanna coughed; things just seemed to go from bad to worse around here.She'd had a sore throat and sniffles the last three days.She didn't know whether to be frightened or not.Diseases were an everyday thing in medieval times.Yeah, and lots of people died of them, too!She wiped her nose and tried to concentrate on what Woodcarver was saying."Scrupilo has already made some gunpowder.It works just as Dataset predicted.Unfortunately, he nearly lost a member trying to use it in a wooden cannon.If we can't make cannon, I'm afraid  "  A week ago, Woodcarver wouldn't have been welcome here; all their meetings had been down in the castle halls.But then Johanna got sick  it was a "cold", she was sure  and hadn't felt like running around out of doors.Besides, Scriber's visit had kind of shamed her.Some of the packs were decent enough.She had decided to try and get along with Woodcarver  and Pompous Clown too, if he'd ever come around again.As long as creatures like Scarbutt stayed out of her way Johanna leaned a little closer to the fire and waved away Woodcarver's objections; sometimes this pack seemed like her eldest grandmother."Assume we can make them.We have lots of time till summer.Tell Scrupilo to study the dataset more carefully, and quit trying shortcuts.The question is, how to use them to rescue my star ship. "Woodcarver brightened.The drooler broke off wiping its muzzle to join the others in a head bob."I've talked about this with Peregr  with several people, especially Vendacious.Ordinarily, getting an army to Hidden Island would be a terrible problem.Going by sea is fast, but there are some deadly choke points along way.Going through the forest is slow, and the other side would have plenty of warning.But great good luck: Vendacious has found some safe trails.We may be able to sneak  "  Someone was scratching at the door.Woodcarver cocked a pair of heads."That's strange," she said."Why?"Johanna asked absently.She hiked the quilt around her shoulders and stood.Two of Woodcarver went with her to the door.Johanna opened the door and looked into the fog.Suddenly Woodcarver was talking loudly, all gobble.Their visitor had retreated.Something was strange, and for an instant she couldn't figure what it was.This was the first time she had seen a dogthing all by itself.The point barely registered when most of Woodcarver spilled past her, out the doorway.Then Johanna's servant, up in the loft, began screaming.The sound jabbed pain through Johanna's ears.The lone Tine twisted awkwardly on its rear and tried to drag itself away, but Woodcarver had it surrounded.She shouted something and the screeching in the loft stopped.There was the thump of paws on wooden stairs, and the servant bounded into the open, its crossbows cocked.From down the hill, she heard the rattle of weapons as guards raced toward them.Johanna ran to Woodcarver, ready to add her fists to any defense.But the pack was nuzzling the stranger, licking its neck.After a moment, Woodcarver caught the Tine by its jacket."Help me carry him inside, Johanna please. "The girl lifted the Tine's flanks.The fur was damp with mist and sticky with blood.Then they were through the doorway and laying the member on a pillow by the fire.The creature was making that breathy whistling, the sound of ultimate pain.It looked up at her, its eyes so wide she could see the white all around.For an instant she thought it was terrified of her, but when she stepped back, it just made the sound louder and stretched its neck toward her.She knelt beside the pillow.It lay its muzzle on her hand."W what is it?"She looked back along its body, past the padded jacket.The Tine's haunches were twisted at an odd angle, one legged dangling near the fire."Don't you know  " began Woodcarver."This is part of Jaqueramaphan. "She pushed a nose under the dangling leg, and raised it onto the pillow.There was loud talk between the guards and Johanna's servant.Through the door she saw members holding torches; they rested their forepaws on their fellows shoulders, and held the lights high.No one tried to come in; there'd be no room.Johanna looked back at the injured Tine.Scriber?Then she recognized the jacket.The creature looked back at her, still wheezing its pain."Can't you get a doctor!"Woodcarver was all around her.She answered, "I am a doctor, Johanna. "She nodded at the dataset and continued softly, "At least, what passes for one here. "Johanna wiped blood from the creature's neck.More kept oozing."Well, can you save him?""This fragment maybe, but  " One of Woodcarver went to the door and talked to the packs beyond."My people are searching for the rest of him I think he is mostly murdered, Johanna.If there were others well, even fragments stick together. ""Has he said anything?"It was another voice, speaking Samnorsk.Scarbutt.His big ugly snout was stuck through the doorway."No," said Woodcarver."And his mind noise is a complete jumble. ""Let me listen to him," said Scarbutt."You stay back, you!"Johanna's voice was a scream; the creature in her arms twitched."Johanna!This is Scriber's friend.Let him help. "As the Scarbutt pack sidled into the room, Woodcarver climbed into the loft, giving him room.Johanna eased her arm from under the injured Tine and moved aside, ending up at the doorway herself.There were lots more packs outside than she had imagined, and they were standing closer than she had ever seen.Their torches glowed like soft fluorescents in the foggy dark.Her gaze snapped back to the fire pit."I'm watching you!"Scarbutt's members clustered around the pillow.The big one lay its head next to the injured Tine's.For a moment the Tine continued its breathy whistling.Scarbutt gobbled at it.The reply was a steady warbling, almost beautiful.From up in the loft, Woodcarver said something.She and Scarbutt talked back and forth."Well?"said Johanna."Ja  the fragment  is not a 'talker'," came Woodcarver's voice."Worse," said Scarbutt."For now at least, I can't match his mind sounds.I'm not getting sense or image from him; I can't tell who murdered Scriber. "Johanna stepped back into the room, and walked slowly to the pillow.Scarbutt moved aside, but did not leave the wounded Tine.She knelt between two of him and petted the long, bloodied neck."Will Ja"  she spoke the sound as best she could  "live?"Scarbutt ran three noses down the length of the body.They pressed gently at the wounds.Ja twisted and whistled except when Scarbutt pressed his haunches."I don't know.Most of this blood is just splatter, probably from the other members.But his spine is broken.Even if the fragment lives, he'll have only two usable legs. "Johanna thought for a moment, trying to see things from a Tinish perspective.She didn't like the view.It might not make sense, but to her, this "Ja" was still Scriber  at least in potential.To Scarbutt, the creature was a fragment, an organ from a fresh corpse.A damaged one at that.She looked at Scarbutt, at the big, killer member."So what does your kind do with such garbage?"Three of his heads turned toward her, and she could see his hackles rise.His synthetic voice became high pitched and staccato."Scriber was a good friend.We could build a two wheel cart for Ja's rear; he'd be able to move around some.The hard part will be finding a pack for him.You know we're looking for other fragments; we may be able to patch something up.If not well, I have only four members.I will try to adopt him. "As he spoke one head patted the wounded member."I'm not sure it will work.Scriber was not a loose souled person, not in any way a pilgrim.And right now, I don't match him at all. "Johanna slumped back.Scarbutt wasn't responsible for everything that went wrong in the universe."Woodcarver has excellent brood kenners.Maybe some other match can be found.But understand it's hard for adult members to remerge, especially non talkers.Single fragments like Ja often die of their own accord; they just stop eating.Or sometimes Go down to the harbor sometime, look at the workers.You'll see some big packs there but with the minds of idiots.They can't hold together; the smallest problem and they run in all directions.That's how the unlucky repacks end" Scarbutt's voice traded back and forth between two of his members, and dribbled into silence.All his heads turned to Ja.The member had closed his eyes.Sleeping?He was still breathing, but it sounded kind of burbly.Johanna looked across the room at the trapdoor to the loft.Woodcarver had stuck a single head down through the hole.The upside down face looked back at Johanna.Another time, her appearance would have been comical."Unless a miracle happens, Scriber died today.Understand that, Johanna.But if the fragment lives, even a short time, we'll likely find the murderer. ""How, if he can't communicate?""Yes, but he can still show us.I've ordered Vendacious's men to confine the staff to quarters.When Ja is calmer, we'll march every pack in the castle past him.The fragment certainly remembers what happened to Scriber, and wants to tell us.If any of the killers are our own people, he'll see them. ""And he'll make a fuss. "Just like a dog."Right.So the main thing is to provide him with security right now and hope our doctors can save him. "They found the rest of Scriber a couple of hours later, on a turret of the old wall.Vendacious said it looked like one or two packs had come out of the forest and climbed the turret, perhaps in an attempt to see onto the grounds.It had all the markings of an incompetent, first time probe: nothing of value could be seen from that turret, even on a clear day.But for Scriber it had been fatally bad luck.Apparently he had surprised the intruders.Five of his members had been variously arrowed, hacked, decapitated.The sixth  Ja  had broken his back on the sloping stonework at the base of the wall.Johanna walked out to the turret the next day.Even from the ground she could see brownish stains on the parapet.She was glad she couldn't go to the top.Ja died during the night, though not from any further enemy action; he was under Vendacious's protection the whole time.Johanna went the next few days without saying much.At night she cried a little.God damn their "doctoring".A broken back they could diagnose, but hidden injuries, internal bleeding  of such they were completely ignorant.Apparently, Woodcarver was famous for her theory that the heart pumped the blood around the body.Give her another thousand years and maybe she could do better than a butcher!For a while she hated them all: Scarbutt for all the old reasons, Woodcarver for her ignorance, Vendacious for letting Flenserists get so close to the castle and Johanna Olsndot for rejecting Scriber when he had tried to be a friend.What would Scriber say now?He had wanted her to trust them.He said that Scarbutt and the others were good people.One night, about a week later, she came close to making peace with herself.She was lying on her pallet, the quilt heavy and warm upon her.The designs painted on the walls glimmered dim in the emberlight.All right, Scriber.For you I will trust them.Pham Nuwen remembered almost nothing of the first days after dying, after the pain of the Old One's ending.Ghostly figures, anonymous words.Someone said he'd been kept alive in the ship's surgeon.He remembered none of it.Why they kept the body breathing was a mystery and an affront.Eventually the animal reflexes had revived.The body began breathing of its own accord.The eyes opened.No brain damage, Greenstalk(?)said, a full recovery.The husk that had been a living being spoke no contradiction.What was left of Pham Nuwen spent a lot of time on the OOB's bridge.From before, the ship reminded him of a fat sowbug.The bugs had been common in the straw laid across the floor of the Great Hall of this father's castle on Canberra.The little kids had played with them.The critters didn't have real legs, just a dozen feathery spines sticking out from a chitinous thorax.No matter how you tumbled them, those spines/antennas would twitch the bug around and it would scuttle on its way, unmindful that it might be upside down from before.Yes, the OOB's ultradrive spines looked a lot like a sowbug's, though not as articulate.And the body itself was fat and sleek, slightly narrowed in the middle.So Pham Nuwen had ended inside of a sowbug.How fitting for a dead man.And now he sat on the bridge.The woman brought him here often; she seemed to know it should fascinate him.The walls were displays, better than he had ever seen in merchantman days.When the windows looked out the ship's exterior cameras, the view was as good as from any crystal canopy bridge in the Qeng Ho fleet.It was like something out of the crudest fantasy  or a graphics simulation.If he sat long enough, he could actually see the stars move in the sky.The ship was doing about ten hyperjumps per second: jump, recompute and jump again.In this part of The Beyond they could go a thousandth of a light year on each jump  farther, but then the recompute time would be substantially worse.At ten per second that added up to more than thirty light years per hour.The jumps themselves were imperceptible to human senses, and between the jumps the were in free fall, carrying the same intrinsic velocity they'd had on departing Relay.So there was none of the doppler shifting of relativistic flight; the stars were as pure as seen from some desert sky, or in low speed transit.Without any fuss, they simply slid across the sky, the closer ones the faster.In half an hour he went farther than he had in half a century with the Qeng Ho.Greenstalk drifted onto the bridge one day, began changing the windows.As usual she spoke to Pham as she did so, chatting almost as if there were a real person here to listen:  "See.The center window is an ultrawave map of the region directly behind us. "Greenstalk waved a tendril over the controls.The multicolored pictures appeared on the other walls."Similarly for the other five points of direction. "The words were noise in Pham's ears, understood but of no interest.The Rider paused, then continued with something like the futile persistence of the Ravna woman."When ships make a jump when they reenter, there's a kind of an ultrawave splash.I'm checking if we're being followed. "Colors on the windows all around, even in front of Pham's eyes.There were smooth gradations, no bright spots, no linear features."I know, I know," she said, making up both sides of the conversation."The ship's analyzers are still massaging the data.But if anyone's pacing us closer than one hundred light years, we'll see them.And if they're farther than that  well, then they probably can't detect us. "It doesn't matter.Pham almost shut the question out of his mind.But there were no stars to look at; he stared at the glowing colors and actually thought about the problem.Thought.A joke: no one Down Here ever really thought about anything.Perhaps ten thousand starships had escaped the Fall of Relay.Most likely, the Enemy had not cataloged those departures.The attack on Relay had been a minor adjunct to the murder of Old One.Most likely, the OOB had escaped unnoticed.Why should the Enemy care where the last of Old One's memories might be hiding?Why should it care about where their little ship might be bound?A tremor passed through his body; animal reflex, surely.Panic was slowly rising in Ravna Bergsndot, every day a little stronger.It was not any particular disaster, just the slow dying of hope.She tried to be near Pham Nuwen part of every day, to talk to him, to hold his hand.He never responded, not even  except perhaps by accident  to look at her.Greenstalk tried too.Alien though Greenstalk was, the Pham of before had seemed truly attracted to the Riders.He was off all medical support now, but he might as well have been a vegetable.And all the while their descent was slowing, always a little worse than what Blueshell had predicted.And when she turned to the News in some ways that was the most horrifying of all.The "death race" theory was getting popular.More and more, there were folk who seemed to think that the human race was spreading the Blight:   Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Baeloresk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Alliance for the Defense [Claimed cooperative of five polyspecific empires in the Beyond below Straumli Realm.No record of existence before the Fall of the Realm. ]Subject: Blighter Video thread  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, War Trackers Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group Date: 17.95 days since Fall of Relay Text of message:  So far we've processed half a million messages about this creature's video, and read a goodly fraction of them.Most of you are missing the point.The principle of the "Helper's" operation is clear.This is a Transcendent Power using ultralight communication to operate through a race in the Beyond.It would be fairly easy to do in the Transcend  there are a number of stories about thralls of Powers there.But for such communication to be effective within the Beyond, truly extensive design changes must be made in the minds of the controlled race.It could not have happened naturally, and it can not be quickly done to new races  no matter what the Blight says.We've watched the Homo Sapiens interest group since the first appearance of the Blight.Where is this "Earth" the humans claim to be from?"Half way around the galaxy," they say, and deep in the Slow Zone.Even their proximate origin, Nyjora, is conveniently in the Slowness.We see an alternative theory: Sometime, maybe further back than the last consistent archives, there was a battle between Powers.The blueprint for this "human race" was written, complete with communication interfaces.Long after the original contestants and their stories had vanished, this race happened to get in position where it could Transcend.And that Transcending was tailor made, too, re establishing the Power that had set the trap to begin with.We're not sure of the details, but a scenario such as this is inevitable.What we must do is also clear.Straumli Realm is at the heart of the Blight, obviously beyond all attack.But there are other human colonies.We ask the Net to help in identifying all of them.We ourselves are not a large civilization, but we would be happy to coordinate the information gathering, and the military action that is required to prevent the Blight's spread in the Middle Beyond.For nearly seventeen weeks, we've been calling for action.Had you listened in the beginning, a concerted strike might have been sufficient to destroy the Straumli Realm.Isn't the Fall of Relay enough to wake you up?Friends, if we act together we still have a chance.Death to vermin.The bastards even played on humanity's foundling nature.Foundling races were rare, but scarcely unknown.Now these Death to Vermin creatures were turning the Miracle of Nyjora into something deadly evil.Death to Vermin were the only ones to call for pogroms, but even respected posters were saying things that indirectly might support such action:   Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Triskweline, SjK units  From: Sandor Arbitration Intelligence at the Zoo [A known military corporation of the High Beyond.If this is a masquerade, somebody is living dangerously. ]Subject: Blighter Video thread, Hanse subthread  Key phrases: limits on the Blight; the Blight is searching something  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, Close coupled Automation Interest Group, War Trackers Interest Group  Date: 11.94 days since Fall of Relay  Text of message:  The Blight admits that it is a Power that tele operates sophonts in the Beyond.But consider how difficult it is to have a close coupled automation with time lags of more than a few milliseconds.The Known Net is a perfect illustration of this: Lags range between five milliseconds for systems that are a couple of light years apart  to (at least) several hundred seconds when messages must pass through intermediate nodes.This, combined with the low bandwidth available across interstellar distances, makes the Known Net a loose forum for the exchange of information and lies.And these restrictions are inherent in the nature of the Beyond, part of the same restrictions that make it impossible for the Powers to exist down here.We conclude that even the Blight can't attain close coupled control except in the High Beyond.At the Top, the Blight's sophont agents are literally its limbs.In the Middle Beyond, we believe mental "possession" is possible but that considerable preprocessing must be done in the controlled mind.Furthermore, considerable external equipment (the bulky items characteristic of those depths) is needed to support the communication.Direct, millisecond by millisecond, control is normally impractical in the Middle Beyond.Combat at this level would involve hierarchical control.Long term operations would also use intimidation, fraud, and traitors.These are the threats that you of the Middle and Low Beyond should recognize.These are the Blight's tools in the Middle and Low Beyond, and what you should guard against for the immediate future.We don't see imperial takeovers; there's no profit [sustenance] in it.Even the destruction of Relay was probably just a byplay to the murder it was simultaneously committing in the Transcend.The greatest tragedies will continue to be at the Top and in the Low Transcend.But we know that the Blight is searching for something; it has attacked at great distances where major archives were the target.Beware of traitors and spies.Even some of humanity's supporters sent a chill through Ravna:   Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Triskweline, SjK units  From: Hanse  Subject: Blighter Video thread, Alliance for the Defense subthread  Key phrases: Death Race Theory  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, War Trackers Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group  Date: 18.29 days since Fall of Relay  Text of message:  I have obtained specimens from the human worlds in our volume.Detailed analysis is available in the Homo sapiens interest group archive.My conclusions: previous (but less intensive) analysis of human phys/psych is correct.The race has no built in structures to support remote control.Experiments with living subjects showed no special inclination toward submission.I found little or no evidence of artificial optimization.(There was evidence of DNA surgery to improve disease resistance: drift timing dated the hackwork at two thousand years Before Present.The blood of Straumli Realm subjects carried an optigens, Thirault [a cheap medical recipe that can be tailored across a wide mammalian range]. )This race  as represented by our specimens  looks like something that arrived from the Slow Zone quite recently, probably from a single origin world.Has anyone done such retesting on more distant human worlds?Crypto: 0  As received by: OOB shipboard ad hoc  Language path: Baeloresk Triskweline, SjK units  From: Alliance for the Defense [Claimed cooperative of five polyspecific empires in the Beyond below Straumli Realm.No record of existence before the Fall of the Realm. ]Subject: Blighter Video thread, Hanse 1  Distribution:  Threat of the Blight, War Trackers Interest Group, Homo Sapiens Interest Group  Date: 19.43 days since Fall of Relay  Text of message:  Who is this "Hanse?"It makes objective, tough sounding noises about testing human specimens, but it keeps its own nature secret.Don't be fooled by humans telling you about themselves!In fact, we have no way of testing the creatures that dwell in Straumli Realm; their protector will see to that.Death to vermin.And there was a little boy trapped at the bottom of the well.Some days, no communication was possible.Other days, when the OOB antenna swarm was tuned in exactly the right direction and when the vagaries of the zone favored it  then Ravna could hear his ship.Even then the signal was so faint, so distorted, that the effective transmission rate was just a few bits per second.Jefri and his problems might be only the smallest footnote to the story of the Blight (less than that, since no one knew of him), but to Ravna Bergsndot these conversations were the only bright thing in her life just now.The kid was very lonely, but less so now, she thought.She learned about his friend Amdi, about the stern Tyrathect and the heroic Mr.Steel and the proud Tines.Ravna smiled to herself, at herself.The walls of her cabin displayed a flat mural of jungle.Deep in the drippy murk lay regular shadows  a castle built in the roots of a giant mangrove tree.The mural was a famous one; the original had been an analog work from three thousand years ago.It showed life at an even further remove, during the Dark Ages on Nyjora.She and Lynne had spent much of their childhood imagining that they were transported to such a time.Little Jefri was trapped in the real thing.Woodcarver's butchers were no interstellar threat, but they were a deadly horror to those around them.Thank goodness Jefri had not seen the killing.This was a real medieval world.A tough and unforgiving place, even if Jefri had fallen in with fair minded people.And the Nyjoran comparison was only vaguely appropriate.These Tines were pack minds; even old Grondr 'Kalir had been surprised at that.All through Jefri's mail, Ravna could see the panic among Steel's people:   Mister Steel asked me again if theres any way we can make our ship to fly even a little.I dont know.We almost crashed, I think.We need guns.That would save us, at least till you get here.They have bows and arrows just like in Nyjoran days, but no guns.Hes asking me, can you teach us to make guns?Woodcarver's raiders would return, and this time in enough force to overrun Steel's little kingdom.Back when they thought OOB's flight would be only thirty or forty days, that had not seemed great a risk, but now Ravna might arrive to find Woodcarver's murdering complete.Oh Pham, dear Pham.If you ever really were, please come back now.Pham Nuwen of medieval Canberra.Pham Nuwen, trader from the Slowness What would someone such as you make of this?Hmm.Ravna knew that  under his bluster  Blueshell was at least as much a worrier as she.Worse, he was a nitpicker.The next time Ravna asked him about their progress, he retreated into technicalities.Finally Ravna broke in, "Look.The kid is sitting on something that just might blow the Blight sky high, and all he has are bows and arrows.How the long will it be till we get down there, Blueshell?"Blueshell rolled nervously back and forth across the ceiling.The Skroderiders had reaction jets; they could maneuver in free fall more adroitly than most humans.Instead they used stick patches, and rolled around on the walls.In a way, it was kind of cute.Just now, it was irritating.At least they could talk; she glanced across the bridge to where Pham Nuwen sat facing the bridge's main display.As usual, all his attention was fixed on the slowly moving stars.He was unshaven, his reddish beard bright on his skin; his long hair floated snarled and uncombed.Physically he was cured of his injuries.Ship's surgeon had even replaced the muscle mass that Old One's communication equipment had usurped.Pham could dress and feed himself now, but he still lived in a private dreamworld.The two riders twittered at each other.It was Greenstalk who finally answered her question: "Truly, we're not sure how long.The quality of the Beyond changes as we descend.Each jump is taking us a fraction longer than the one before. ""I know that.We're moving toward the Slow Zone.But the ship is designed for that; it should be an easy matter to extrapolate the slowing. "Blueshell extended a tendril from ceiling to floor.He diddled with the matte corrugations for a second and then his voder made a sound of human embarrassment."Ordinarily you would be correct, my lady Ravna.But this is a special case For one thing, it appears that the zones themselves are in flux. ""What?""It's not that unheard of.Small shifts are going on all the time.That's a major purpose for bottom lugger ships: to track the changes.We're having the bad luck to run through the middle of the uncertainty. "Actually, Ravna had known that interface turbulence was high at the Bottom below here.She just didn't think of it in grandiose terms like "zone shifting"; she also hadn't realized it was serious enough to affect them yet."Okay.How bad can it get then?How much can it slow us?""Oh my. "Blueshell rolled to the far wall; he was standing on starry sky now."It would be nice to be a Low Skroderider.So many problems my high calling brings me.I wish I could be deep in surf right now, thinking on olden memories. "Of other days in the surf.Greenstalk carried on for him: "It's not 'the tide, how high can it rise?'It's 'this storm, how bad can it get?'Right now it is worse than anything in this region during the last thousand years.However, we have been following the local news; most agree that the storm has peaked.If our other problem gets no worse, we should arrive in about one hundred and twenty days. "Our other problem.Ravna drifted to the center of the bridge and strapped onto a saddle."You're talking about the damage we took getting out of Relay.The ultradrive spines, right?How are they holding up?""Quite well, apparently.We've not tried to jump faster than eighty percent of design max.On the other hand, we lack good diagnostics.It's conceivable that serious degradation might happen rather suddenly. ""Conceivable, but unlikely," put in Greenstalk.Ravna nodded.Considering all their other problems, there was no point in contemplating possibilities beyond their control.Back on Relay, this had looked like a thirty or forty day trip.Now the boy in the well might have to be brave for a long time yet, no matter how much she wished otherwise.Hmm.Time for Plan B then.Time for what someone like Pham Nuwen might suggest.She pushed off the floor and settled by Greenstalk."Okay, so the best we can plan on is one hundred and twenty days.If the Zone surge gets worse or if we have to get repairs" Get repairs where?That might be only a delay, not an impossibility.The rebuilt OOB was supposed to be to repairable even in the Low Beyond."Maybe even two hundred days. "She glanced at Blueshell, but he didn't interrupt with his usual amendments and qualifications."You've both read the messages we're getting from the boy.He says the locals are going to be overrun, probably in less than one hundred days.Somehow, we have to help him before we actually arrive there. "Greenstalk rattled her fronds in a way Ravna took for puzzlement.She looked across the deck at Pham, and raised her voice a trifle.Hey you, you should be an expert on this!"You Skroderiders may not recognize it, but this is a problem that's been seen a million times in the Slow Zone: civilizations are separated by years  centuries  of travel time.They fall into dark ages.They become just as primitive as the pack creatures, these 'Tines'.Then they get visited from outside.In a short time, they have technology back again. "Pham's head did not turn; he just looked out across the starscape.The Skroderiders rattled at each other, then:  "But how can that help us?Doesn't rebuilding a civilization take dozens of years?""And besides, there's nothing to rebuild on the Tines' world.According to the child, this is a race without antecedents.How long does it take to found a civilization?"Ravna waved a hand at the objections.Don't stop me, I'm on a roll."That's not the point.We are in communication with them.We have a good general library on board.Original inventors don't know where they're going; they're groping in the dark.Even the archaeologist/engineers of Nyjora had to reinvent much.But we know everything about making airplanes and such; we know hundreds of ways of going at it. "Now faced with necessity, Ravna was suddenly sure they could do it."We can study all the development paths, eliminate the dead ends.Even more, we can find the quickest way to go from medieval to specific inventions, things that can beat whatever barbarians are attacking Jefri's friends. "Ravna's speech tumbled to a stop.She stared, grinning, first at Greenstalk and then at Blueshell.But a silent Skroderider is one of the universe's more impassive audiences.It was hard even to tell if they were looking at her.After a moment Greenstalk said, "Yes, I see.And rediscovery being so common in the Slow Zone, most of this may already be worked out in the ship's library. "That's when it happened: Pham turned from the window.He looked across the deck at Ravna and the Riders.For the first time since Relay, he spoke.Even more, the words weren't nonsense, though it took her a moment to understand."Guns and radios," he said."Ah yes. "She looked back at him.Think of something to make him say more."Why those in particular?"Pham Nuwen shrugged."It worked on Canberra. "Then damn Blueshell started talking, something about doing a library search.Pham stared at them for moment, his face expressionless.He turned back to watch the stars, and the moment was lost."Pham?"He heard Ravna's voice just behind him.She had stayed on the bridge after the Riders left, departing on whatever meaningless preparations their meeting had ordained.He didn't reply, and after a moment she drifted around and blocked his view of the stars.Almost automatically, he found himself focussing on her face."Thank you for talking to us We need you more than ever. "He could still see lots of stars.They were all around her, slowly moving.Ravna cocked her head, the way she did when she meant friendly puzzlement."We can help"  He didn't answer.What had make him speak just now?Then: "You can't help the dead," he said, vaguely surprised at his own speaking.Like eye focussing, the speech must be a reflex."You're not dead.You're as alive as I am. "Then words tumbled from him; more than in all the days since Relay."True.The illusion of self awareness.Happy automatons, running on trivial programs.I'll bet you never guess.From the inside, how can you?From the outside, from Old One's view  " He looked away from her, dizzy with a doubled vision.Ravna drifted closer till her face was just centimeters from his.She floated free, except for one foot tucked into the floor."Dear Pham, you are wrong.You've been at the Bottom, and at the Top, but never in between 'The illusion of self awareness'?That's a commonplace of any practical philosophy in the Beyond.It has some beautiful consequences, and some scary ones.All you know are the scary ones.Think: the illusion must apply just as surely to the Powers. ""No.He could make devices like you and I. ""Being dead is a choice, Pham. "She reached out to pass her hand down his shoulder and arm.He had a typical 0 gee change of perspective; "down" seemed to rotate sideways, and he was looking up at her.Suddenly he was aware of his splotchy beard, his tangled hair floating all about.He looked up at Ravna, remembering everything he'd thought about her.Back on Relay she'd seemed bright; maybe not smarter than he, but as smart as most competitors of the Qeng Ho.But there were other memories, how Old One had seen her.As usual, His memories were overwhelming; about this one woman, there was more insight than from all Pham's life experience.As usual, it was mostly unintelligible.Even His emotions were hard to interpret.But He had thought of Ravna a little like a favored dog.Old One could see right through her.Ravna Bergsndot was a little manipulative; He had been pleased/amused(?)by that fact.But behind her talk and argument, He'd seen a great deal of "goodness" might be the human word.Old One had wished her well.In the end, He had even tried to help.Insight flitted past him, too fast to catch.Ravna was talking again:  "What happened to you is terrible enough, Pham, but it's happened to others.I've read of cases.Even the Powers are not immortal.Sometimes they fight among themselves, and someone gets killed.Sometimes, one commits suicide.There's a star system, Gods' Doom it's called in the story: A million years ago, it was in the Transcend.It was visited by a party of the Powers.There was a Zone surge.Suddenly the system was twenty light years deep in the Beyond.That's about the biggest surge there is firm record of.The Powers at Gods' Doom didn't have a chance.They all died, some to rot and rusted ruin others to the level of mere human minds. ""W what became of those?"She hesitated, took one of his hands between hers."You can look it up.The point is, it happens.To the victims, it's the end of the world.But from our side, the human side Well, the human Pham Nuwen was lucky; Greenstalk says the failure of Old One's connections didn't do gross organic damage.Maybe there's subtle damage; sometimes the remnants just destroy themselves, whatever is left. "Pham felt tears leaking from his eyes.And knew that part of the deadness inside had been grief for His own death."Subtle damage!"He shook his head and the tears drifted into the air."My head is stuffed with Him, with His memories. "Memories?They towered over everything else.Yet he could not understand them.He could not understand the details.He could not even understand the emotions, except as inane simplifications  joy, laughter, wonder, fear and icy steel determination.Now, he was lost in those memories, wandering like an idiot in a cathedral.Not understanding, cowering before icons.She pivoted around their clasped hands.After a moment, her knee bumped gently against his."You're still human, you still have your own  ", her own voice broke as she saw the look in his eyes."My own memories?"Scattered amid the unintelligible he would stumble on them: himself at five years, sitting on the straw in the great hall, alert for the appearance of any adult; royals were not supposed to play in the filth.Ten years later, making love to Cindi for the first time.A year after that, seeing his first flying machine, the orbital ferry that landed on his father's parade field.The decades aspace."Yes, the Qeng Ho.Pham Nuwen, the great Trader of the Slowness.
