We kissed, believing we wouldnt die.EzCal were silent.Elsewhere, out of my sight, hundreds of thousands of Ariekei stared at each other, high but coming lucid for the first time in a long time.Hosts!we heard from the barriers.There were only a few minutes before they began to gather, to clear away their dead.For one moment, simultaneously in every quarter, every Ariekes listening and their revivifying rooms stiffened again, in an aftershock of feeling.I saw it on the cam, later.It happened when, without looking at each other, according to I dont know what impulse, Cal and Ez leaned forward and with flawless timing, spoke the staccato Cut and Turn Language word that meant yes.Part Seven  THE LANGUAGELESS    20  I WAS A TRADER AGAIN.I went with others in corvids to the country.Business.Now in this reign of EzCal, god drug II, we could leave again.MayBel was our speaker on this trip.They could say that name: .In the weeks since Id flown out last, the landscape had raggedly changed.By the jut of rocks there were skeletons, where biorigging had come to die.The meadows were torn up by the tracks of stampeding machines, the new routes of refugees into the city in search of the god drug voice, and later refugees out, in that exodus we still didnt understand.The city had been depleted, by more than the numbers of dead.We came down where there were farmlands worked, newly, differently from before.A society was starting.It wasnt strong.The farmers were addicts again, of a new drug, but it was better than being the mindless starvelings they had been.We had no choice but to be dealers.We went with our datchips beyond the reach of the speakers.We found Ariekei who still thought EzRa was the ruler and voice of Embassytown, and had unaccountably been silent these past days.Despite MayBels articulacy it wasnt clear they understood what had changed, until with eager giftwing fingers, they played the files, and heard the voice of EzCal.I want more of the other one, a farmer said.It tried to remember the way we used to trade: the haggling Terre had taught the Ariekei when our predecessors first arrived.Clumsily it offered us more of the medical rigging it had grown if we would give it another of EzRas chips.We explained that we had none.Another, though, preferred the newcomer.It indicated several of its chewing beasts, which would defecate fuel and components: it would give us more than ever before, if we would give it more of this new EzCal.Were those Ariekei who preferred EzCal more measured?Was there a calm, a focus to them, contrasting with a febrile air to those who still hankered for EzRa?Certainly, after ecstasy and before withdrawal, the composure between the Ariekeis necessary fixes seemed easier for us than they had been before.This EzCal version of Language left the Ariekei clearer headed, a little more like the Hosts we had grown up with.We tried to intervene, to shape what structures were emerging.We tried to re establish conduits for our necessaries.I imagined Scile dead in all the landscapes I passedin the city, huddled where his aeoli had failed; in the first downs beyond.We overflew desolate remnants of farms, vats dedicated by old agreements to the production of our foods: nutrient rich pabulum; crops in Terre air bubbles; food animals and sheets of meatcloth.Fallen and falling, there were parts though that were restorable.Our crews did what they could, coaxed airglands to fill chambers, restarted traumatised birth pens.We found local Ariekene keepers, and with snips of EzCals speechifying we restored them to mindfulness and gave them delight, coaxed them back to the farmsteads to help us.They cured the buildings, fixed the cityward flow of what we needed.Cells of food jostled like corpuscles on their way to Embassytown.With those peristalses of imports, we might have more or less ignored the city, now that its inhabitants werent attacking us anymore.We could have just broadcast the god drugs announcements to its convalescing boroughs to make its inhabitants pliant.We didnt, of course.Most of us felt concern, even responsibility, for the biopolis.Nonetheless, we werent expecting what turned out to be the vigorous interventions of EzCal.Really, of Cal.Cal, and with him the other half of the god drug, didnt merely broadcast or make careful forays into the streets, to find a new Ariekei government: EzCal paraded.The committee could have tried to stop them.Ez was our prisoner.When sometimes he triedalways obviouslyto make his own plans, to turn a situation to an advantage, he was cackhanded.At first, mostly, he did as we told him; then he did what Cal told him.Cal disturbed me: his fever of importance.What we said was he was ours, that we decided what he did, and Ez with him, and it was true for a few days, until hed remembered the minutiae of ruling.No, lets not go slowly, he said to us after thatto me, in fact, after Id said that the city was still dangerous, and that with the systems wed put in place we maybe didnt need to deal too closely with it yet.Oh yes we do, he said.EzCals recitations were quite different from EzRas.Cal put a transmitter in front of the Embassy, where he could be seen when he Languaged.He would turn up early for the broadcasts and wait, arms folded or on his hips, looking at the square, and to our surprise, it wasnt only him who did so: Ez would be there, too.He barely spoke except during these performances, in Language, and if he did, his mumbles and monosyllables made you think he was barely with you.But he never made Cal wait.Cal wouldnt look at Ez except as he had to.It was easy to see he hated him.He found a way, though, to make himself into this new thing, using Ez as a tool.All you who listen to me, ez/cal said.It was the third Utuday in ez the third monthling of October.I didnt look at the feeds but I know what Id have seen if I had: clutches of Ariekei throughout the city ringing the speakers and clinging to each other.I wasnt aware I was listening to EzCals words until I reacted with shock to a promise Id not known I was translating.I will come and walk among you tomorrow, EzCal said.I swear I heard noises from the city when they did.Faintly, over the membranous walls.That reaction was a revolution of a kind.Id never seen any Ariekes understand or pay attention to the specifics of what EzRa had saidtheir voice had been nothing but intoxicant.Where listeners had liked one banal or idiotic phrase over another, it was as abstract and meaningless a preference as that for a favourite colour.This was not the same.Some in the city, even tripping on EzCals voice, had understood the content of those words.I wished Bren had been there with me when that happened.What in hell are you doing?I went and said to Cal.At first he didnt seem to notice me.Then his expression went from bewilderment to irritation to uninterest in less than a second.He walked away, and Ez followed him, and Ezs guards followed them both.LIKE THE KING in a story, EzCal climbed up the barricades and down again into what had been our streets, and into a mass of hundreds of waiting Ariekei.They were motionless and silent.They moved out of EzCals way with little hoof steps.EzCals retinue of nervous men and women scrambled down the plastone set rubbish and rubble behind them.No path was cleared for us; we had to weave very tentatively between the Hosts.There were plenty of us, viziers insisting that they were indispensable, I, MagDa and others from the committee after them and trying to issue orders or just watching, collating.I had a sense I couldnt quite articulate that of course Cal, EzCal, had known that their words wouldnt only fulfil and fuel Ariekei cravings, but would communicate specifics.The effortlessness of it.EzRas audience had fugued as much at agricultural reports as at the narratives Ez had seemed or pretended to think caught them up.Now the stories Ez told had real audiences, but they werent his stories anymore.The Ariekei kept their fanwings flared, listening hard.Cal walked as if he and Ez would keep on to the edge of historic Embassytown and into the city.They had no aeoli, so this was pure theatre.Ez kept up with him.Listeners, EzCal said.They were amplified by tiny point microphones on their clothes.Cal hadnt been looking at Ez, Id have put money on it, but they spoke together.EzCal waited so long I might have expected the hold of their voice on the assembled to ebb.It had only been a single word, not even a clause, with the grammar that seemed particularly succulent to the Ariekei.But they waited.Listeners, EzCal said.Do you understand me?The Ariekei told them yes.Raise your giftwings, EzCal said, and the Ariekei did.Shake them, they said, and again, immediately, the Ariekei did.Id never seen anything like this.None of the watching Terre looked anything but stunned.If Ez was excited or surprised he showed no sign of it at all.He just looked out at all these addict obedient.Raise your giftwings to listen, EzCal said.Listen.They said the city was ill, that it must be healed, that there was very much to do, that there were plenty of hearers in the city who were still dangerous or endangered, or both, but that things would be better now.To the Ariekei, these political platitudes, in this voice, might be revelations.They listened, and they were transported.I didnt see any pleasure in Cals expression.The grim strain of his face, the muscles clenchingit looked to me as if he had no choice but to do and be this, now.Listen, EzCal said, and the Ariekei listened harder.The walls strained.The windows sighed.WHEN THEY REGREW the city the Ariekei changed it.In this rebooted version the houses segmented into smaller dwellings and were interspersed with pillars like sweating trees.Of course there were still towers, still factories and hangars for the nurturing of young and of biorigging, to process the new chemicals the Ariekei and their buildings emitted when they listened to EzCal.But the housescape we overlooked took on a more higgledy piggledy aspect.The streets seemed steeper than they had been, and more various: the chitin gables, the conquistador helmet curves newly intricate.The old halls were still there, and that architecture revived enough by EzCals voice to fail to die, but not quite to rise.The tracts of decayed city between new village like neighbourhoods were dangerous.The prowling grounds of animals and of Ariekei so far gone theyd never fully woken.They would crowd isolated loudhailers during announcements and gain enough from EzCals voice to give them aggressive need, but not enough to give them mind.Well clear them out, when we can, Cal said.In the meantime the city was scattered fiefdoms, with each of which we tried to establish protocols.I found out something of their specificsthat ones run by a little coalition of the not very dependent; that ones too risky to go into right now; the Ariekes running that place there, around the minaret, it was a functionary before the fallfrom Bren.Bren learnt them from YlSib.MagDa wont push you on it, Bren said to me.But...Bren saw the expression on my face.You can see whats going on, he said finally.Theyre not running things now, theyre not in a position to close the infirmary...You think they would if they could?I dont know and just now I dont care.Cal certainly wont.You saw what happened when EzCal spoke.If MagDa needs to know anything you know, please tell them.We need them clued in.Theyre smart, they must know the sort of source youre getting information from, but they wont ask.They have plans, Im sure.Theyve been spending time in Southels lab.Have you seen them talking to her?It wasnt as part of an official group, committee business, that I went back into the city, when I did.I went with Bren, to meet his friends again: YlSib, that secret rogue Ambassador.OUR AIR SHAPING was weak enough now that we had to wear aeoli within what had recently been Embassytown streets.So far as we could Bren and I were careful to avoid vespcams, though I knew if we were seen wed only be a rumour among many.We stationed ourselves in the ruins.From a balcony in an apartment where children had lived (I trod over the debris of toys) we saw EzCal go again among crowds of Ariekei that listened and obeyed their instructions.Next time theyre going to head into the city, said Sib.I hadnt heard YlSib enter.So...Sib pointed out of the window at EzCal.Language works differently with this one.We should have called them OgMa, not EzCal Bren said.We looked at him for an explanation.A god, he said, who did sort of the same thing.YlSib wore biorigged pistols.Bren and I had cruder weapons.YlSib moved with vastly more facility than the halting citynauts with whom Id made earlier forays.They didnt hesitate on the way to where brickwork in ruins became biology.The air changed on our way.The way the currents went over me wasnt like the wind in Embassytown.We were in a place full of new sounds.Small fauna claimed areas.Ariekei in the streets didnt stop for us, though some raised eye corals and stared.There were pools overhung by bladderwrackish polyps that dripped reactions into the liquid.I wondered if they were foundations, deliberate town planning.I looked down an avenue of marrowy trees to Embassytown.An Ariekes near us startled me, asked repeatedly in Language what we were doing.I raised my weapon but YlSib were speaking.Im, they said.These are and then they said something yl that wasnt our names.They are coming with me.Im going home., YlSib said, and they put stress in their formulation by making it a personal.I, homegoer, was what they said, so I wondered if going home was a powerful thing to the Ariekei too.They know us, said Yl.These days some are too gone to remember, but if we meet any who can speak, we should be alright.Although, Sib said, I guess there might be new allegiances.Some of them might have......reasons to not let us pass.In fact some Language we heard on that journey made little sense.Phrases spoken by wrecks of speakers out of nostalgia for meaning.YlSib led us finally to a shredded clearing.I gasped.There was a man waiting for us.He leaned below a column of metal that recurved over his head very like a streetlamp.He looked transplanted from an old flat image of a Terre town.They nodded, muttered to Yl and Sib and Bren.They made sure I couldnt hear them.The man reminded me of no one.He was nondescript and dark skinned, in old clothes, an aeoli of a kind I didnt recognise breathing into him.There was nothing I could have said about him.He left with YlSib and Bren came back to me.Who the fuck is that?I said.Is he cleaved?No, said Bren.He shrugged.I dont think so.Maybe his brothers dead by now, but I dont think so.They just didnt like each other very much.Of course I knew this counterworld of exiles existed now, of misbehaving cleaved, Staff unstaffed, bad Ambassadors; but to see its doings astounded me.How had they kept going during the days of collapse, before god drug II?Do you speak to any of the similes still?Bren said.Jesus, I said.Why?Not really.I saw Darius at a bar, ages ago.We were both embarrassed.I mean Embassytowns too small for me not to run into them sometimes, but its not as if we talk.Do you know what theyre doing?I dont think theres a they, Bren.Its all...disbanded.After what happened.Maybe some of them still meet...But that scene was ruined ages ago.After Hasser.Can you imagine now?No one cares about them anymore, including their speakers.Language...I laughed.It isnt what it used to be.YlSib returned, scraping decaying city stuff off their clothes.Thats true, Bren said.But its not true that no one cares anymore.You dont know where were going: your companys been requested.What?I had not thought that this infiltration was about me, that I was a task to be fulfilled.YlSib led me to a basement analogue and ushered me in, into the biolit presence of Ariekei.Avice Benner Cho, YlSib said.They spoke my names perfectly simultaneously, at the same pitch, so though it was two voices it sounded to me like one.The room smelt of Ariekei.There were several.They were making noises, speech and mutterings of thought.One approached me out of the half dark and spoke a greeting.YlSib told me its name.I looked at its fanwing.Christ, I said.Weve met.It had been a close companion of Surl Tesh echer, , surl the best liar in Ariekei history.It was the Ariekes Id once called Spanish Dancer.Does it remember...?Of course it remembers, Avice, Bren said.Why do you think youre here?BREN AND YLSIB gave to the gathered Ariekei a clutch of datchips.They took them quickly, their limbs and digits betraying agitation.Do EzCal know youre recording them?I said.I hope not, Bren said.Youve seen?Theyre trying to do what Ez did when he was part of EzRamake sure we cant build up a stock of recordings to make them redundant.But you have.These are just their public recitations, he said.They cant stop people tapping those, and why would they?They think because its been said, because its out there, the Hostsve heard it, and its lost its thing.I looked one by one around the other Ariekei there.There were other patterns on other fanwings I thought I had seen before.Some of these were in Surl Tesh echers group as well, I said.I looked at Bren.They were its friends.Yes, Bren said.What they can do is lie, Bren said.Not that any of thems anything like as virtuoso as Surl Tesh echer was.It was...He shrugged.A harbinger.On the edge of something.Your husband was right, YlSib said.To stop it.In his terms he was right.It was changing everything.There was a silence.This lot have had to carry on without it since.Its slow.They do what they can.Every Ariekes took a datchip, each to a different part of the room.Each in similar elegant motion draped its fanwing over it.Their membranes spread.They withdrew, hunched into sculptures, made the room a drug house.With the volume very low, they ran the sounds.Responded instantly as I watched, trembling, judders of bio ecstasy.I could see lights of speakers through taut fanwing skin, hear the muffled chirruping of audio: the soul of EzCal, or its spurious fabricated semblance.How the hell can those recordings still work?I whispered.Theyve already been heard.Not by them, Bren said.They wait.Bloody willpower.They fold up their wings when they know EzCals going to speak.They were already doing it with EzRa.They make themselves hold out.Theyre trying to go longer and longer without.It was hard to imagine that the shuddering figures represented a resistance to the reign of god drug.Still.They can take these now because they didnt take them before, Yl said.One by slow one the Ariekei rose.They looked at me.A strange reminiscence.We seemed to pick up where wed left off.Spanish Dancer came up to me: its companions circled me.They said the succession of sounds in Language that were me.I had not heard myself spoken for a long time.They said me first as a fact.There was a girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her.Then they began to deploy me as a simile.We now, Spanish Dancer said, when we take what is given in god drugs voice, we are like the girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her.The others responded.SURL TESH ECHER was more than just the best liar, you know, Bren said.It was sort of a vanguard.It was never just about performing lies.Why would they be so interested in you, if that was all, Avice?How do lying and similes intersect?What other things in this world, one of the Ariekei was saying, are like the girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her?Its been hard, Bren said.They were all scattered by the war.The war of not enough drug.The war of Ez killed Ra.The war of the walking dead.Now theyve tracked each other down, theyre going to keep going.They didnt worship Surl Tesh echer.But it was sort of a figurehead.Prophet, Yl or Sib said.Why cant you tell MagDa, and even Cal...I said, then trailed off because of course the group in this room was a conspiracy.Striving to limit the power of the god drug.Cal would try to sabotage it.I wished I didnt believe that.Bren nodded, watching me think.Yeah, said Bren.Now, MagDa are different.But theres only so much theyll risk.They want to get out, now, and they can only see one way to do it, and thats hanging on.They wont risk anything else.They might even scupper it.Scupper what?What are you trying to do?Not me, Bren said.All of you.You, you, I said to YlSib, these Hosts.What are you plural trying to do?MagDas way wont work, Bren said.Just to stave things off.Thats why they wont take on Cal.Its not enough to try to keep everything going until the ship gets here.We have to change things.While he spoke, the Ariekei moved around me like flotsam in a current, and they said the phrase I was and tried to make it into new things, to think of new things they could insist that it, I, my past, was like.EzCals not the only one we have to be careful of, Bren said.You have to keep this quiet.I remembered the parting of Ariekei when Hasser had come and killed .Youre worried about other Ariekei, I said.These speakers were dangerous before, Bren said.Scile was right about them, and so were their...He shrugged and shook his head so I would know whatever phrase he used was inexact.Ruling clique.And I dont know where they are now, yet, but I bet EzCal have an idea.Or Cal does.Theyve done business before.Why do you think hes so keen to get into the city?Id thought Cals eagerness was newly visionary fervour.But back then, there in the Festival of Lies, Cal, and Pear Tree, looking at me.Jesus Pharos.Scile had watched too.A conspirator then, Scile would approve of EzCal now.Their priorities, like CalVins before them, were power and survival; Sciles were always the city and its stasis.Those had overlapped once, but history had left Scile behind.Hence his hopeless walk.Cal might already have found his friends again, Bren said.This lot...He indicated the room.They were a threat once.You saw.Now...He laughed.Well, everythings changed.But they might still be a threat.Different: but maybe even more.Cal might not know this group still exists.If he ever knew.But the Ariekei he worked with before do.So if he finds them, this lot here had better keep very quiet.So we have to, as well.How are they a threat?I said.I never understood.Why are they doing this?Whatever it is theyre doing.Bren struggled.Its hard to explain.I dont know how to say.You dont know, I said.He bobbed his head in a half yes half  no.Hows your Language, Avice?said one of YlSib.They spoke to Spanish Dancer and it answered.I could follow some, and when I shook my head Yl or Sib would translate a few clauses.Its not good that we are this.We wish to be other than this.Were like the girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given her because we imbibe what is given to us by EzCal.There was a long silence.We want instead to be like the girl who was hurt in darkness and ate what was given to her in that we want to be...and then there was silence again, and Spanish Dancer shook its limbs.It tried to use your simile twice, contradictorily, Sib said.But it couldnt quite manage.Now, Spanish Dancer went on, its worse.We didnt expect this.It was a bad thing when we were made intoxicated and helpless by the god drugs words, lost ourselves, but now its different and worse.Now when the god drug speaks we obey.Yes, it said that with modulations that meant nothing to me, but no matter how alien the Ariekene mental map, sense of self, I thought that must be truly terrible.Id seen the crowds respond instantly to EzCals instructions, choiceless about it.We want to decide what to hear, how to live, what to say, what to speak, how to mean, what to obey.We want Language to put to our use.They resented their new druggy craving and their newer inability to disobey.This conclave could hardly be unique in that.But it dovetailed with what they had always wanted to achieve: their longtime striving for lies, to make Language mean what they wanted.That older desire seemed to make them execrate their new condition even more than other conscious Ariekei.We promised to bring you here, Bren said.Said it like a Host.He smiled at the childs oath.They were adamant they had to see you.I better get you back before youre missed, then YlSib will have to go on.Other drops.These people arent the only ones trying to find a different way.What a dangerous circuit, through rebel cells in the collapsed, regrowing city.Id always stressed, as Id had it stressed to me, how incommensurable Terre and Ariekene thinking were.But I thought about who it was had told me that, those many times.Staff, and Ambassadors with a monopoly on comprehension.It was giddying to feel suddenly that I was allowed and able to make any sense of Ariekene actions.What I saw there was dissent, and I understood it.I saw only these liars, these fervent attempters to change their speech.Bren and YlSib might go from them to others trying to eradicate all their cravings and live Languageless; from there perhaps to those fighting to disobey EzCals casual orders; then to others who were maybe searching for chemical cures.I wasnt even really participant on this trip, the first visit, though I was present and Bren trusted me.He hadnt brought me out of camaraderieI was there because I was a simile, and these dissidents wanted me for strategic purposes, as another group might request a piece of ware, or a chemical, or explosives.Embassytown in its crisis was throwing up fervour.Give me three days, I thought, and Id find people who believed that EzCal, or Ez, or Cal, was the messiah, or the devil, or both; that the Ambassadors were angels; or devils; that the Ariekei were; that the only hope was to leave the planet as fast we could; that we must never leave.So with the Ariekei, I thought, and felt hopeful and depressed at once.Language was incapable of formulating the uncertainties of monsters and gods common elsewhere, and I was abruptly convinced that these gatherings were the Ariekene cargo cults.Was I at a Ghost Dance?Bren and YlSib were patronising the far fetched, millennial and desperate.I watched Spanish Dancer struggle to express me, to make me mean things Id never meant before, try to force similes into new shapes.We are like the girl who was hurt in the dark and ate what was given to her because we...because like her we are...we are hurt...It circled me and stared at me, and tried to say ways it was like me.Why wont MagDas plan work?I said.I know, I know, but...just say to me once why we cant just keep going until the ship.Bren, Sib and Yl looked at each other, to see who would speak.Youve seen how EzCals acting.It was Sib.You think its safe for us to carry on like this?And, among other things, Bren said, sounding, if Im honest, disappointed, even if it did work, you saw what happened to the Ariekei when EzRa ended, without their...dose.So what about when the relief gets here?When we leave?He indicated Spanish Dancer.What happens then, to them?21  ANOTHER OF OUR FLYERS disappeared.It had been doing rounds of farmsteads close to the city, as per EzCals orders, asking forinsisting onwhat we needed: it wouldnt be hard for us to dismantle the speakers if what we required wasnt forthcoming, and the Ariekene farmers knew that.The coms broke off and werent re established.We released vespcams.Squads were subduing the last independent zones on isolated floors of the Embassy, where squatter chiefs and their groups had refused amnesty.I was out at a barricade, a mass of broken furniture, odds and sods of houses, unneeded machines; but coagulated here, unusually, not with plastone but a quick setting polymer, a resin poured all over and set hard as brick and glass clear.The detritus was visible, like rubbish floating in water, frozen in a moment.We werent at war anymore, and machines were cutting a V trench walkway through the barrier, an excised wedge with perfect flat faces through the tough transparency and the crap within.The passs edges were randomly punctuated with sectioned debris.I was with Simmon.We were watching the gusting staticky visions of vespcams on his handscreen.Whats that?I said.It was the lost corvid.It was dead.The ground around it was scorched.There were heaps that might be human bodies.WE CAME FAST and armed over the wild, over paths made by Ariekei and their animals and zelles, perhaps by wild outsider humans, exiles from Embassytown, in outland farms.We hadnt established contact with all of them.I was surprised by a brief and strong sense of loss for floaking, of all things.I tried to tell myself that this, what I was doing, was heir to that tough going with the flow, but I was hardly taken in.The airship was spread across the ground.We descended into a terrible aftermath.Eventually we went to work.The closest thing we had to a specialist took samples from what might be bite marks or burn marks on all the corpses.They were everywhere.Oh God, said our investigator.There was Lo, of Ambassador LoGan.His chest was caved and cauterised.Thats not a crash injury.Thats not a crash injury.Vizier Jaques was there, and the edge of his wound, his missing arm, was neither shorn clear nor burned, but a rip from which hed bled out.Hed died in excruciation, it looked like, scrabbling for his flung away limb.The microbes the group had brought inside them had started the job of decay, and the Ariekene landscape in which they worked made for chemical oddness, so the rot wasnt like rot in Embassytown.Everyone was dead.The expedition had included a rare Kedis functionary.A mature hermale I hadnt known.Oh Jesus, its Gorrin, someone said.The Kedis are going to be...We went slowly from body to body, putting off each as long as we could.The wind was cold as we picked through the remnants of our friends.We tried to gather them: some fell apart; others we wrapped to take home.Look.We were trying to reconstruct what had happened, following the scraped earth, reading it, it and the dead become hieroglyphs.This was brought down.A hot toothed missile had burst into the flyers side.There are no predators like that...someone started to say.But it came down slow enough for them to get out.That was me.They came out and then they were...they were hit outside.We found remnants of biorigging eggs, from a recent barter trip, smears of yolk and foetal machines.The crew had been returning.The aeoli we wore made our own voices loud in our ears, as if each of us was alone.Carrying our dead we flew with carronades ready, looking for the ranch where our compatriots had been.It was announced by smoke.Outlying dwellings were ruined, the nurseries mostly gone.There was one hutch that seemed still just alive, and in distress, but we had no idea how to provide it a coup de grace, and could only try to ignore its pain.There were no Ariekene dead.The kraal was empty.Dust coloured animals ran away, and our arrival sent up rag paper scavengers, flocks that moved like thinking smoke.Someone fired and we all dived for the floor shouting.The gun howled: it was of one of Embassytowns treasures, an old banshee tech gun cobbled into a form humans could use.The officer had shot it at nothinga movement, a scuttling of tiny fauna.Ariekene young had been abandoned, and floated in a broth of dead.There were bodies of their elders.Hoofprints were everywhere.We set cams to follow what we thought might be trails.Body thick arteries emerged from the farm, entangled in the earth and the tube that went over the rockscape toward the city.The pipeline was burst.The matter of it was spewed by a sabotage blast, the ground a quag of dirt and amniotic fluids.Whats this?In a hollow were organic discards.Frameworks like splayed fish ribs; skin in webbing between tines; a nest of intricate bones.These were remnants of fanwings.We gathered the little trophies.Behind us we heard the distress call of a last building left alive.Wed put speakers in the farms with which wed made contact, and the ongoing supplies of EzCals voice should have guaranteed us what we needed, but wed had trouble before.Now we knew why.We sent crews and cams along the supply pipes, and found other ruptures.We lost another flight, and then the officers we sent to find it.EzCal went to the centre of the city to broadcast.Their journey there from Embassytown was as extreme in its pomp as we could do, then.There was pressure on those of us in the committee, still ostensibly Ez and Cals organisers, Ezs jailers, indeed, to attend and wear smart clothes.Wyatt came with us.His reward for birthing EzCal was that he was freed, kept under watch but made committee.He was expert in crisis politics, and he wasnt a Bremen agent anymore, or not just then.Whatever happened later wed deal with later.If he could get away with a goddamn canopy, he would, I said quietly to MagDa.The god drug walked in the city, Ez looking down and unsmiling, Cal, his head still shaved in the style he now maintained, his stitches gone but new tattoos mimicking them on his scarred scalp, looking up, occasionally glancing at Ez with energy and hate.Theyd have us carrying them on our fucking shoulders.MagDa didnt smile.We were in the middle of that daily promenade from Embassytown, behind EzCal, surrounded by Ariekei who followed their instructions and shouted sort of cheers.Mag and Da were stricken.Wait, I wanted to say to them.Its alright.There are others.There are people and Ariekei looking for ways out.I wouldnt betray Bren, and I knew he was right: there was too much risk that MagDa might be unnerved by these plans.I dont know...said MagDa to me.I dont even know what well do.When the ship comes.We have to guard our resources, Cal said, after their performance, looking at footage of ruined farms.EzCal insisted that the rations of Embassytowners be reduced.They ordered squads of constables to the nearest plantations, and to those that provided our most needed pabulum.The attacks were becoming more frequent.Each group of officers that went out was accompanied, as they had to be for communication with those they were sent to protect, by an Ambassador.Itll be fine, PorSha said to me, preparing.Its not the first time.Were used to it.We had to go out to haggle, before, didnt we?Out of the city.Its the same.It wasnt the same.Before, with Embassytown and the world collapsing, they, and all the better Ambassadors, had kept us alive with their desultory trades.This time they followed orders.I had originally thought that Cal would do as little as he could when he became part of god drug II.I was used to being wrong.EZCAL DID FIND Pear Tree, the erstwhile leader of that once powerful Ariekene faction.Perhaps Cal had his own investigators.Not all the city dwelling Embassytowner exiles would share Yl and Sibs perspective: they might have enemies, of whom some were perhaps agents for EzCal.What had happened was that during one of their speakings in the city plaza EzCal had been suddenly in the middle of a small group of Ariekei retracting and extruding their eyes and staring.EzCal hadnt been afraid.One of the group had been Pear Tree.It accompanied EzCal on their following performance, walking with them all the way from a meeting in Embassytown.There were other Ariekei with them, some closer to EzCal than any humans, Staff, committee or Ambassador.My memory was unreliable, but watching the tridsI played hookey from my accompanying dutiesI suspected at least two others might have been among those that had stood aside to let Hasser murder .I held my breath: I was on a side in a secret war.That time, EzCal didnt speak for a while.They rationed their words.When they did, they announced that Pear Treewas chief of this township.That this area was chosen from all the scattered remnant parts of the city, to be EzCals node, and that its regent there was .EzCal couldnt speak except as the god drug, and the words they said were always compulsions.This wasnt like a momentary order to raise gift wings: it was a ruling, and when EzCal finished speaking, the Ariekei who had heard them remained ruled by .The Ariekei were very quiet, and then did not complain.For all I knew  might already have been head of whatever clutch of streets it frequented.EzCal might have changed nothingexcept that by saying it, they changed it.There was now a collaboration, an allegiance, between Embassytown and this new heart of the city.I had just seen the tasks of Bren, YlSib and their comrades, get harder.I think I had been avoiding thinking about what Cal, EzCal, really was, and were.Whether it was design, buffoonery or luck that underlay our new politics, I was not safe.ARIEKI FROM the new township EzCal had inaugurated left the city with PorSha, KelSey and the constables.These were now joint operations.KelSey came back, but PorSha did not.We had receivers and cams around all the farm grounds.They flagged us when anything beyond their expectation algorithms occurred, which is how it was that all of us in the committee were buzzed instantly, and the footage relayed direct to our rooms, at the next attack.Corvids headed out.They wouldnt arrive in time, but we had to act, even pointlessly.I was with Bren.We scrolled as fast as we could back and forth through chaotic images.Scenes of tending, of interaction with farmhands.PorSha, a pair of tall diffident women, communicating necessities to the Ariekei.Convulsions as the tube passed goods that would be shat out in Embassytown.Snatches of conversation in Anglo Ubiq.The time counter skipped.This datspace was fritzing.We need Ehrsul, Bren said.Do you ever...?I shook my head.A constable was standing with mud across her.She stared anxiously not at us but over our shoulders, attempting to report.Sergeant Tracer at..., she said.There were violent noises.She watched something off screen.Under attack, she said.Groups of...hundreds, fucking hundreds...Her transmission ended, the picture spasmed and was replaced by a view rapidly diminishing as the cam flew up.Tracer was lying on her back, among human dead.She tugged off her aeoli mask, an unthinking spasm of dying fingers.Images strobed.A great company of Ariekei, moving quite unlike the farmhands.They galloped, they swung giftwings, they trailed blood, liquid drizzled from weapons, a spray of dust.None of them spokethey shouted wordlessly, voicing only attack meanings, without Language.They beheaded a minor Staff man Id once known a bit.I held my mouth closed.One kicked him down, gripped him with its giftwing, another swung a blade worked out of some coralline stuff.They had biorigged weapons they turned on the farm walls.One Ariekes shot our women and men with a carbine, wielding the Terre weapon with surprising precision.We saw them murder Terre without weapons at all, send jags of their own bone into human innards, or yank masks away, suffocating our people in alien wind.Bren sped up the footage.He brought us up to live shots.Carnage was ongoing.The officers were vastly outnumbered.They were trying to reach the corvid, and were taken down.PorSha was shouting Language to the attackers.Wait, wait, no more of these actions, they said.Please, we ask you not to do this We lost that cam, and when it came back PorSha were dead.Bren cursed.All the speakers we had placed in the farmland started suddenly to shout, in EzCals voice.The god drug had found each other, here in Embassytown, and were yelling down the line.Stop!they said, and things stilled.I leaned towards the crude picture.The carnage, all the motionless Ariekei.Jesus, I said at the numbers.I held up my hands.Bren said, What are they doing?Stand still, the god drug shouted across the kilometres.Come forward, stand in front of the dead Ambassador.For seconds there was no motion.Then an Ariekes stepped out of the crowd, took careful hoof steps into the cams view.The others watched it.Its back, its extended fanwing, stretched open, listening to the voice from the speaker, turning into and out of the light as it listened to EzCals voice.There were no other fanwings in the crowd of killers.Thats a farmer, its said.Its not one of them.A large Ariekes slapped two of its companions with its giftwing and pointed at the enthralled on comer.It arced its back to display a wound.EzCal continued to speak.They saw the buildings hearing, and that one, I said.Thats why they stopped.Not because they had to.One by one at first, then countless at a time, the murder squad of Ariekei arched their backs.I saw the quivering of scores of fanwing stubs.I heard Bren whisper, God.The Ariekei displayed their wounds.Some made wordless sounds Im certain were of triumph.They know we can see them, I said.Following speechless giftwing jabbed instructions from their larger comrade, self mutilated Ariekei stood either side of the entranced farmhand, and held it.It didnt even notice.Stop what you are doing, release your grips, we heard EzCal say.Their Language petered out.The farmer raised and opened its giftwing repeatedly, obeying the instruction not intended for it.Those it was intended for ignored it, did not hear it, kept hold of their quarry.The big Ariekes tugged the biorigging farmers fanwing.I winced.It twisted.Its victim screamed doubly and tried and failed to get away.Its tormentors giftwing moved like a human hand uprooting a plant.The fanwing wrenched free: roots of gristle and muscle parted and with a burst of blood came finally away, pulling fibres out of the quivering back, trailing them.Fanwings are at least as sensitive as human eyes.The traumatised Ariekes opened its mouth and fell, stupefied with pain.It was dragged away.The deafener held up its grotesque dripping bouquet.It made a loud wordless noise.Triumph or rage.EzCal were speaking again, I realised.They issued orders and were ignored.22  THAT WAS THE START of open war.We called it the First Farm Massacre though it was the only one we then knew ofa horrible perspicacity.It took us days to understand what was coming.That final mutilation, by one Ariekes of another, was a recruitment.If the victim survived the shock and pain, it was made another soldier, on the enemy side.How does it receive orders?I said, but no one could answer me.Perhaps there were no orders, only rage stripped of language.Can they think?If they cant speak, can they think?Language for Ariekei was speech and thought at once.Wasnt it?We didnt know whether to roll back our presence from the outlying farms or bolster it, so we tried both.More visceral pipelines blew.The pictures were the same in different settings: in a copse of trees like organs; in a dustbowl; in scree; each time a burst of flesh and a litter of ruined cargo.Our stores depleted.Infrastructure wasnt the only thing attacked.After the Farm Massacre the fanwingless swept into an encampment defended by other, hearing, Ariekei: this became the Cliff Edge Incident.We had troops there with them equipped with rare out tech, and they were able to shoot several of the attackers.But half our officers were killed by the time the marauders suddenly left, galvanised by some signal we couldnt understand.Perhaps by an empathy to tides we couldnt sense, like birds circling and become one organism.We didnt become inured to the footage.EzCal called the committee together, and brought , Pear Tree, with them.EzCal told us they were making changes in the way the city was administered, as if that might help.Cal talked about making allegiances against bandits.I tried to listen, to understand the shape of politics now.From Brens scorn I knew that where there wasnt anarchy or secret renegacy in the city, there were strange comprador authorities like that of .We had to witness absurd joint patrols.Under EzCals orders, our constables policed outlands beyond the city accompanied by Ariekei dragooned into militia.An Ambassador had to be present, of course, to transmit instructions, on what EzCal stressed was god drug authority.They took weapon training: career bureaucrats attempted to transform themselves.The missions disaggregated, failed, as orders relayed by disorientated Ambassadors were interpreted differently by Ariekei and Terre.The Ariekei were not even resentful, so far as I could seeand I knew now that there was such a thing as Ariekene resentmentonly bewildered.The first three such patrols achieved nothing and the fourth was attacked.When we reached the site the rescue squad found our Terre people dead and their Ariekei colleagues mostly gone, inducted no doubt by brute surgery into the rebels.The joint patrols were ended.WHAT IF THEY dont want to fight?Even after theyve had their fanwing taken?Or what if they want to fight the ones that took their fanwing?I, traitor, was at the secret liars club in the city, again, so Spanish Dancers comrades could consider me.They contemplated urgently.As urgently as Bren had brought me back through the city.Spanish Dancer itself wasnt there.A fanwing isnt just an ear, Yl said.She and Sib looked at me.It hears, yes.Its the minds main doorway.More important than sight.Their physiologys nothing like ours.If theyve got no fanwing, they hear no sounds at all.And with no sound, they cant hear their own speech.Which means an Ariekes cant speak.So it cant speak Language.Perhaps there was no sense of truth left for them, or thought.Those rebels must be a fractured community, without speech, if they were a community at all.Language, for the Ariekei, was truth: without it, what were they?An unsociety of psychopaths.So even if they didnt want to be part of the rebellion, I said, with their fanwings taken, theyre...Insane.Or something like it.Maybe some dont take part.Maybe they drift.Get lost.Maybe they die.But theyre not what they were.Its no surprise that most of them join....The bandits.YlSib smiled without humour at EzCals absurd terminology.They cant all have been press ganged, I said.The key cadre of that army was surely those that had deafened themselves.That despairing, literally maddening act of revolt had perhaps been performed independently, risen up in hundreds of Ariekei; perhaps a gathering had agreed together, and in a mass act of self inflicted agony, between EzRas meaningless pronouncementsbecause we realised these dissidents had been attacking us, if in more disorganised fashion, before the reign of god drug IIhad made themselves an organising core.There might be a room somewhere littered with rotting fanwings, the birthplace of this millennial mass.Each trapped in itself.God knew how many of them, a strike force of the lonely and lost.How did they move together?How did they coordinate their assaults?I thought again that they must be gusted by instinct and some deep grammar of chaos: they could not plan.Maybe each strike wasnt a careful raid but just a sharp edge of the random.I remembered, though, what had looked like interactions among the self deafened during the First Farm Massacre, and was perturbed.Theyve started coming into the city in squads, Sib said.It wasnt a city, just tribes of junkies and thralls where a city had been.What they used to do was kill the other Ariekei.If youve broken free from something like god drug......maybe they thought those who didnt were disgusting.But they werent killing them now: they were recruiting.YlSib made simultaneous plucking motions, twisting imagined fanwings from their anchorings.I shuddered and turned it into a headshake, and told them I wanted to see Spanish Dancer, as if it was a friend.I wanted to understand it, to make sense of its strategy for emancipation.YlSib were pleased.They took me to the grotto under eaves fringed like fingers where the Ariekes lived.For quite a long time, we all sat silently.A HAMLET OF houses in the suburbs, gently regrowing, were taken suddenly down with biorigged weapons of serious power, crossbred from existing strains.Informer Ariekei working with the god drug told us that something terrible was coming.All who live in the city and all who live in Embassytown must stand against these attackers, EzCal said, with  beside them.No matter how assiduously the compelled Ariekei tried to obey them, those words were too nebulous to mean much.EzCal never spoke an intoxicating order making all Ariekei obey : they must have been afraid of unintended consequence.I wanted to return, as often and for as long as I could, to the liars in the city straining to meet s challenge.I was trying to learn how to get therethe route and strategies for the routebut still could only go when YlSib and Bren came with me.After that dramatic attack on the remains of the city, Spanish Dancer and the other gathered Ariekei were distressed (I recognised it).One of their number had left them.YlSib listened.They argued with it.It told them...It said it was ashamed.Bad enough when the first god drug had pushed them into trips: so much worse now they could see their tripping selves made to obey.It...oh.It plucked itself.No, I said.It wasnt just, I thought, the loss of theirwhat, friend?to self savagery, of mind as well as body, so it could not hear nor speak again, that must hurt them.They wanted to be a hope, against the revolutionary suicide of those that tore out their social mind with their fanwings, became nihilist revenge.Were there ranks among the Languageless?Were those that made themselves an aristocracy above those attack recruited?I looked at Spanish Dancers many dark point eyes, which had seen its companion tear its fanwing like trash, after their years of work, their project that had started long before this end of the world.BY OUR BARRICADE gates, in rump street markets, quickly tolerated, an economy of recycled necessities, people began to talk again about the relief.When it would come, where we would go, and what life would be like for Embassytowners exiled to Bremen.Our now wild cameras inhabited the plains.Many broke down or their signals degraded.But some still got footage to us.Some were a long way into country not punctuated even by farms, beyond the transport ducts.I heard rumours of certain footage before I saw it.I scorned the idea that it existed but was being kept from mewasnt I committee?But though it failed, I discovered that there had been an effort to do just that.I shouldnt have been shocked.An internal split, a craven and conniving column reporting direct to the god drug.There wasnt even any reasoning.Secrecy was just a bureaucrats reflex.There was no way they could contain these files: a day after the first stories about them started circulating, the rest of us got to see them.A group of us uploaded them to committee datspace.Bren was agitated.I was taken aback by his impatience, that he so obviously had no idea if the whispers about what we were to see were true.I was so used to him knowing things he didnt tell me.I teased him about it, in a rather brittle manner.We watched the cams memories.Plenty of kilometres away but hardly in another country.The viewpoint swept through narrows: I swayed to avoid overhangs the recorder had ducked days before.Some fool at the back said something like Why are we watching this?Through a nook in rock the cam went to a valley of pumice coloured earth, burred birdlike suddenly tree  then tower high over the slope, focused where a river had been.We gasped.Someone swore.There was an army.It marched in our direction.There were not hundreds of Ariekei but thousands, thousands.I heard myself say Jesus, Jesus Christ.We knew now why the city seemed depleted.Pharotekton, I said.The microphones were crappy but we heard the noise of the march, the percussion of hard feet walking not in time.The amputee Ariekei shouted.They must not even know, not even hear their own constant catcalls.Machines among them walked at the wordless correction of keepers.The Ariekei carried weapons.This was the only army on this world and it was marching on us.The cam went close, and we saw thousands of stumps of thousands of fanwings.Every Ariekes there was a soldier, not obeying orders but trapped beyond society in soundless solipsism, unable to talk, hear, think, but still moving together in that mystery fashion, sharing purpose without speaking it.They couldnt have a unified intent but we knew they did, and what it was, and that we were it.23  AS WELL AS THE Languageless and the SM, for self mutilated, at first we called the incoming army the Deaf.Embassytowns human deaf objected hard to that; they were right and we were ashamed.Then someone named the attackers according to an antique language.It meant that same word, deaf, but rendered the Surdae any insult seemed diluted; particularly because, fast bastardised or misunderstood, the term became the Surd and then misprisioned into the Absurd.Hosts, coming to kill us for sins wed committed, if at all, without intent.Above all it was their discipline that was absurd, impossible, the way without words groups would peel off from the main slow body, coordinated into snatch squads that tore through strange country and took apart our rangers, or recruited new Ariekei troops by ripping their flesh.Eventually and abruptly transmissions to us ended, cams batted out of the air by breakdown, wind or the sudden irritation of the enemy.We sent more of course.Plans began.As our spies gusted out to search, we were breaching old agreements and habits of isolation.The cams showed us the coast, the gently toxic sea.We had a country, on which the city sat, in which was Embassytown.We werent used to seeing that.Id used cartographic ware in the immer, but not these charts.We had a continent.It would have been hard for me to trace the outlines of Embassytown, harder to draw the city, and I wouldnt even have recognised the shape of the landmass on which we were such a tiny point.Now we needed them it wasnt hard to break those taboos and pull up maps.Theyd never been forbidden, as Id seen in the out in some unsubtle theocracies: only inappropriate, and old politenesses were dead.Our cams uploaded directions so we could trace the Absurd.Their few, their first, the pioneers had also learnt the specific violence to make unspeaking comrades of their victims.How had it been?They had spread out of the depleting city, claiming farmers, on past any urban gutwork into the wandergrounds of nomads, claiming the nomads, the gatherer hunters of unneeded or escaped technology, building.Someone might one day write the history of that trek, the recruiting crusade.There were more than all those stolen and violently cured rural addicts.I imagined these crazy figures emerging from wilderness like prophets; those distant Ariekei already alarmed or enraged at what they heard of their cousins in the city reduced to zombie ecstatics or the craven desperate, might, even if far off enough to have avoided the affliction, not have needed coercion to join the Absurd.Perhaps thered been a while before the army went in with regular, remorseless violence, and instead thered been debates about endeafening among the not yet recruited, in some settlements.Articulate, last ever uses of speech to argue for its eradication.I made Bren come with me into the city.It was easy to leave, though our borders were supposed to be controlled.Routes in and out werent hard to learn.Theyll be here within two weeks, I said.He nodded.You see theyre all in prime instar?Bren said.Theyre not protecting the old or looking after the young.The young, though, might soon enough be grateful to them.Even uncared for, a few in each Ariekene litter must survive, and when they emerged to their adult form, woke into Language, they would find a city purged of us.Without god drug.The Absurd would martyr themselves to that future.Theyd put themselves beyond the reach of any compromise or agreement.We stuck to the safer sub regions of the city.I found my waymy own, this time, leading Brento where Spanish Dancer and its friends practised lying, and I tried to help them find new ways to speak me.WE'RE FORMING an army, Cal said.We were as disdainful as we could be at that.Gather many of you in the square and be ready to fight, EzCal broadcast to the Ariekei.They told them to put forward soldiers.They demanded  volunteers.was the biggest aggregate of units with a name, and meant anything more than the largest exact number for which terminology existed, , 3072.   translated usually as countless.EzCal were demanding as large a force as the Ariekei could give.Cal waved his hand.Beside him, Ez was like a ventriloquists doll, existing only when he spoke, or was spoken through.Wyatt watched Ez like an anxious relative.I wondered how many Ariekene soldiers the god drug would get, and whether the process of building that force would be violent.The natives in all the little villages left in the city, islands between zones of the deadly mindless, would try to obey, in various ways.They knew the Absurd were coming.The locals ruled or ruled or whatever by , those over which EzCal had given , aegis, would surely provide most of the soldiers....one main force of Ariekei to guard the city, stationed at all the weak points we have, and therell be a couple of...well, of special squads prepared, Cal said, at the committee meeting.I couldnt listen to this, these desperations disguised as strategy.I couldnt look at anyone else in the room.There was nothing we had that could hold off the oncoming army.When we were dismissed I got my stuff together slowly, and after a moment realised it was only I, Ez and Cal left in the room.I dont know how that happened.I wouldnt rush.I couldnt look at them.I was their enemy, and I had secrets that were mutinous.Cal slouched, looking tired.He looked shrunken, far off by the wall.A moments illusion and the chair seemed to dwarf him like a throne would a boy king.Ez stood like a surly courtier.They must be waiting to practise their necessary proclamations.Do you miss my brother, Avice?Cal said.Do I. ..?Vin?I. ..Yes.It was some way true.Sometimes I do.Do you?Cal watched me from under his brow.Yes.I was angry with him.Before he died.He paused.I was angry with him before that, then worse after.Of course.But I miss him.I tried to work out if I could glean any advantage on any axis by keeping him talking, but I could think of nothing to say.Please, he said angrily, not to me.Ez looked up.Ill...Ez said, and walked out.It was the first word Id heard him say for himself, for many days.Cal didnt watch him go.Vin missed you, he said.Did he?Whatever had happened to Cal, whatever hed become, I was sure that he saw me as I saw him through a window of memories that included mornings, evenings together, nudity, of fucking, sometimes beautifully.What could I do but remember the last looks Vin had given me?Id seen that need that could perhaps have been given another name, and that perhaps Cal resented.Because he thought his brothers affections were a zero sum, and that Id stolen from him?Because he didnt have it to give himself?I, to my utmost shock, choked and had to close my eyes.A great big diffuse grief, not just for Vin, but some for him.I thought about the months Id spent as CalVins lover.I tried to recall a time when both of them had moved with me at once.I could not.Had they both touched me at once, ever, or had it always been one, then some languid time later, as Id imagined, assumed, the other?I looked at Cal.Had he merely tolerated his doppels desires, all that time?I thought, Have you and I even been together?Waking without him.I dont get used to it.He spoke rapidly.Im not supposed to.Truth is there are times its not bad.The silence isnt always unwelcome.I looked away from his awful smile.Truth is, Avice, I cant tell you if I miss him.Thats not true, I can tell you and I do, but it isnt as clean a feeling as that.To have to say everything, like I door did...Well, its bad and its good and its bad.Ive been to the retirement homes where cleaved are.Normal ones, not like Bren, making trouble.I dont know, is that me now?He jerked his head at the door through which Ez had left.That bastard, eh?It can be ugly how things go.I was going to say...I dont know what I was going to say.Im doing what I have to.What is it youre doing, Cal?Why dyou have to?I said that though Id not intended to respond, or involve myself in whatever this was.We tried this once before, Cal; you made armies and it was a disaster...Avice, please.He shook his head, and hesitated, as if he was trying very hard to think how to communicate something.
