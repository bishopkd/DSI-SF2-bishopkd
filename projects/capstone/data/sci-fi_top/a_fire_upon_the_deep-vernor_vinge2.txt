The redhead smiled."Call me Pham.Sure, I feel like an over stuffed bag.My sleep time is full of little voices.I've learned an awful lot without experiencing anything.Worse, I've been a target for all this 'education'.It's a perfect setup if Vrinimi wants to trick me.That's why I'm learning to use the local library.And that's why I insisted they find someone like you. "He saw the surprise on her face."Ha!You didn't know that.See, talking to a real person gives me a chance to see things that aren't all planned ahead.Also, I've always been a pretty good judge of human nature; I think I can read you pretty well. "His grin showed he understood just how irritating he was being.Ravna looked up at the green petals of the beachtrees.Maybe this boob deserved what he was getting into."So you have great experience dealing with people?""Given the limitations of the Slowness, I've been around, Ravna.I've been around.I know I don't look it, but I'm sixty seven years old subjective.I thank your Organization for a fine job of thawing me out. "He tipped a non existent hat in her direction."My last voyage was more than a thousand years objective.I was Programmer at Arms on a Qeng Ho longshot  " His eyes abruptly widened, and he said something unintelligible.For a moment he almost looked vulnerable.Ravna reached a hand toward him."Memory?"Pham Nuwen nodded."Damn.This is something I don't thank you people for. "Pham Nuwen had been frozen in the aftermath of violent death, not as a planned suspension.It was a near miracle that Vrinimi Org had been able to bring him back at all  at least with Middle Beyond technology.But memory was the hardest thing.The chemical basis of memory does not survive chaotic freezing well.The problem was enough to shrink even Pham Nuwen's ego by a size or two.Ravna took pity on him."It's not likely that anything is completely lost.You just have to find a different angle on some things. "" Yes.I've been coached about that.Start with other memories; work sideways toward what you can't remember straight on.Well it beats being dead. "Some of his jauntiness returned, but subdued to a really quite charming level.They talked for long while as the redhead worked around the points he couldn't "remember straight on".And gradually Ravna came to feel something she had never expected in connection with a Slow Zoner: awe.In one lifetime, Pham Nuwen had accomplished virtually everything that was possible for a being in the Slowness.All her life she had pitied the civilizations trapped down there.They could never know the glory; they might never know the truth.Yet by luck and skill and sheer strength of will, this fellow had leaped barrier after barrier.Had Grondr known the truth when he pictured the redhead with sword and slug gun?For Pham Nuwen really was a barbarian.He had been born on a fallen colony world  Canberra he called it.The place sounded much like medieval Nyjora, though not matriarchal.He'd been the youngest child of a king.He'd grown up with swords and poison and intrigue, living in stone castles by a cold, cold sea.No doubt this littlest prince would have ended up murdered  or king of all  if life had continued in the medieval way.But when he was thirteen years old everything changed.A world that had only legends of aircraft and radio was confronted by interstellar traders.In a year of trading, Canberra's feudal politics was turned on its head."Qeng Ho had invested three ships in the expedition to Canberra.They were pissed, thought we'd be at a higher level of technology.We couldn't resupply them, so two stayed behind, probably turned my poor world inside out.I left with the third  a crazy hostage deal my father thought he was putting over on them.I was lucky they didn't space me. "Qeng Ho consisted of several hundred ramscoop ships operating in a volume hundreds of light years across.Their vessels could reach almost a third of the speed of light.They were mostly traders, occasionally rescuers, even more rarely conquerors.When Pham Nuwen last knew them, they had settled thirty worlds and were almost three thousand years old.It was as extravagant a civilization as can ever exist in the Slowness And of course, until Pham Nuwen was revived, no one in the Beyond had ever heard of it.Qeng Ho was like a million other doomed civilizations, buried thousands of light years in the Slowness.Only by luck would they ever penetrate into the Beyond, where faster than light travel was possible.But for a thirteen year old boy born to swords and chain mail, the Qeng Ho was more change than most living beings ever experience.In a matter of weeks, he went from medieval lordling to starship cabin boy."At first they didn't know what to do with me.Figured on popping me into cold storage and dumping me at the next stop.What can you make of a kid who thinks there's one world and it's flat, who has spent his whole life learning to whack about with a sword?"He stopped abruptly, as he did every few minutes, when the stream of recollection ran into damaged territory.Then his glance flicked out at Ravna, and his smile was as cocky as ever."I was one mean animal.I don't think civilized people realize what it's like to grow up with your own aunts and uncles scheming to murder you, and you training to get them first.In civilization I met bigger villains  guys who'd fry a whole planet and call it 'reconciliation'  but for sheer up close treachery, you can't beat my childhood. "To hear Pham Nuwen tell it, only dumb luck saved the crew from his scheming.In the years that followed, he learned to fit in, learned civilized skills.Properly tamed, he could be an ideal ship master of the Qeng Ho.And for many years he was.The Qeng Ho volume contained a couple of other races, and a number of human colonized worlds.At 0.3c, Pham spent decades in coldsleep getting from star to star, then a year or two at each port trying to make a profit with products and information that might be lethally out of date.The reputation of the Qeng Ho was some protection."Politics may come and go, but Greed goes on forever" was the fleet's motto, and they had lasted longer than most of their customers.Even religious fanatics grew a little cautious when they thought about Qeng Ho retribution.But more often it was the skill and deviousness of the shipmaster that saved the day.And few were a match for the little boy in Pham Nuwen."I was almost the perfect skipper.Almost.I always wanted to see what was beyond the space we had good records on.Every time I got really rich, so rich I could launch my own subfleet  I'd take some crazy chance and lose everything.I was the yo yo of the Fleet.One run I'd be captain of five, the next I'd be pulling maintenance programming on some damn container ship.Given how time stretches out with sublight commerce, there were whole generations who thought I was a legendary genius  and others who used my name as a synonym for goofball. "He paused and his eyes widened in pleased surprise."Ha!I remember what I was doing there at the end.I was in the 'goofball' part of my cycle, but it didn't matter.There was this captain of twenty who was even crazier than I Can't remember her name.Her?Couldn't have been; I'd never serve under a fem captain. "He was almost talking to himself."Anyway, this guy was willing to bet everything on the sort of thing normal folks would argue about over beer.He called his ship the, um, it translates as something like 'wild witless bird'  that gives you the idea about him.He figured there must be some really high tech civilizations somewhere in the universe.The problem was to find them.In a strange way, he had almost guessed about the Zones.Only problem was, he wasn't crazy enough; he got one little thing wrong.Can you guess what?"Ravna nodded.Considering where Pham's wreck was found, it was obvious."Yeah.I'll bet it's an idea older than spaceflight: the 'elder races' must be toward the galactic core, where stars are closer and there are black hole exotica for power.He was taking his entire fleet of twenty.They'd keep going till they found somebody or had to stop and colonize.This captain figured success was unlikely in our lifetime.But with proper planning we could end up in a close packed region where it would be easy to found a new Qeng Ho  and it would proceed even further."Anyway, I was lucky to get aboard even as a programmer; this captain knew all the wrong things about me. "The expedition lasted a thousand years, penetrating two hundred and fifty light years galactic inward.The Qeng Ho volume was closer to the Bottom of the Slowness than Old Earth, and they were proceeding inwards from there.Even so, it was plain bad luck that they encountered the edge of the Deeps after only two hundred and fifty light years.One after another, the Wild Witless Bird lost contact with the other ships.Sometimes it happened without warning, other times there was evidence of computer failure or gross incompetence.The survivors saw a pattern, guessed that common components were failing.Of course, no one connected the problems with the region of space they were entering."We backed down from ram speeds, found a solar system with a semi habitable planet.We'd lost track of everybody else Just what we did then isn't real clear to me. "He gave a dry laugh."We must have been right at the edge, staggering around at about IQ 60.I remember fooling with the life support system.That's probably what actually killed us. "For a moment he looked sad and bewildered.He shrugged."And then I woke up in the tender clutches of Vrinimi Org, here where faster than light travel is possible and I can see the edge of Heaven itself. "Ravna didn't say anything for a moment.She looked across her beach into the surf.They'd been talking a long time.The sun was peeking under the tree petals, its light shifting across her office.Did Grondr realize what he had here?Almost anything from the Slow Zone had collector's value.People fresh from the Slowness were even more valuable.But Pham Nuwen might be unique.He had personally experienced more than had some whole civilizations, and ventured into the Deeps to boot.She understood now why he looked to the Transcend and called it "Heaven".It wasn't entirely naivete, nor a failure in the Organization's education programs.Pham Nuwen had already been through two transforming experiences, from pre tech to star traveler, and star traveler to Beyonder.Each was a jump almost beyond imagination.Now he saw that another step was possible, and was perfectly willing to sell himself to take it.So why should I risk my job to change his mind?But her mouth was living a life of its own."Why not postpone the Transcend, Pham?Take some time to understand what is here in the Beyond.You'd be welcome in almost any civilization.And on human worlds you'd be the wonder of the age. "A glimpse of non Nyjoran humanity.The local newsgroups at Sjandra Kei had thought Ravna radically ambitious to take a 'prenticeship twenty thousand light years away.Coming back from it, she would have her pick of Full Academician jobs on any of a dozen worlds.That was nothing compared to Pham Nuwen; there were folks so rich they might give him a world if he would just stay."You could name your price. "The redhead's lazy smile broadened."Ah, but you see, I've already named my price, and I think Vrinimi can meet it. "I really wish I could do something about that smile, thought Ravna.Pham Nuwen's ticket to the Transcend was based on a Power's sudden interest in the Straumli perversion.This innocent's ego might end up smeared across a million death cubes, running a million million simulations of human nature.Grondr called less than five minutes after Pham Nuwen's departure.Ravna knew the Org would be eavesdropping, and she'd already told Grondr her misgivings about this "selling" of a sophont.Nevertheless, she was a bit nervous to see him."When is he actually going to leave for the Transcend?"Grondr rubbed at his freckles.He didn't seem angry."Not for ten or twenty days.The Power that's negotiating for him is more interested in looking at our archives and watching what's passing through Relay.Also despite the human's enthusiasm for going, he's really quite cautious. ""Oh?""Yes.He's insisting on a library budget, and permission to roam anywhere in the system.He's been chatting with random employees all over the Docks.He was especially insistent about talking to you. "Grondr's mouth parts clicked in a smile."Feel free to speak your mind to him.Basically, he's tasting around for hidden poison.Hearing the worst from you should make him trust us. "She was coming to understand Grondr's confidence.Damn but Pham Nuwen had a thick head."Yes sir.He's asked me to show him around the Foreign Quarter tonight. "As you well know."Fine.I wish the rest of the deal were going as smoothly. "Grondr turned so that only peripheral freckles were looking in her direction.He was surrounded by status displays of the Org's communication and database operations.From what she could see, things were remarkably busy."Maybe I should not bring this up, but it's just possible you can help Business is very brisk. "Grondr did not seem pleased to report the good news."We have nine civilizations from the Top of the Beyond that are bidding for wide band data feeds.That we could handle.But this Power that sent a ship here"  Ravna interrupted almost without thinking, a breach that would have horrified her a few days earlier."Just who is it, by the way?Any chance we're entertaining the Straumli Perversion?"The thought of that taking the redhead was a chill."Not unless all the Powers are fooled, too.Marketing calls our current visitor 'Old One'. "He smiled."That's something of a joke, but true even so.We've known it for eleven years. "No one really knew how long Transcendent beings lived, but it was a rare Power that stayed communicative for more than five or ten years.They lost interest, or grew into something different  or really did die.There were a million explanations, thousands that were allegedly from the Powers first hand.Ravna guessed that the true explanation was the simplest one: intelligence is the handmaiden of flexibility and change.Dumb animals can change only as fast as natural evolution.Human equivalent races, once on their technological run up, hit the limits of their zone in a matter of a few thousand years.In the Transcend, superhumanity can happen so fast that its creators are destroyed.It wasn't surprising then that the Powers themselves were evanescent.So calling an eleven year Power "Old One" was almost reasonable."We believe that Old One is a variant on the Type 73 pattern.Such are rarely malicious  and we know from whom it Transcended.Just now it's causing us major discomfort, though.For twenty days it has been monopolizing an enormous and increasing percentage of Relay bandwidth.Since its ship arrived, it's been all over the archive and our local nets.We've asked Old One to send noncritical data by starship, but it refuses.This afternoon was the worst yet.Almost five percent of Relay's capacity was bound up in its service.And the creature is sending almost as much downlink as it is receiving uplink. "That was weird, but, "It's still paying for the business, isn't it?If Old One can pay top price, why do you care?""Ravna, we hope our Organization will be around for many years after the Old One is gone.There is nothing it could offer us that would be good through all that time. "Ravna nodded.Actually, there were certain "magic" automations that might work down here, but their long term effectiveness would be dubious.This was a commercial situation, not some exercise in an Applied Theology course."Old One can easily top any bid from the Middle Beyond.But if we give it all the services it demands, we'll be effectively nonfunctional to the rest of our customers  and they are the people we must depend on in the future. "His image was replaced by an archive access report.Ravna was very familiar with the format, and Grondr's complaint really hit home.The Known Net was a vast thing, a hierarchical anarchy that linked hundreds of millions of worlds.Yet even the main trunks had bandwidths like something out of Earth's dawn age; a wrist dataset could do better on a local net.That's why bulk access to the Archive was mostly local  to media freighters visiting the Relay system.But now during the last hundred hours, remote access to the Archive, both by volume and by count, had been higher than local!And ninety percent of those accesses were from a single account  Old One's.Grondr's voice continued from behind the graphics."We've got one backbone transceiver dedicated to this Power right now Frankly, we can't tolerate this for more than a few days; the ultimate expense is just too great. "Grondr's face was back on the display."Anyway, I think you can see that the deal for the barbarian is really the least of our problems.The last twenty days have brought more income than the last two years  far more than we can verify and absorb.We're endangered by our own success. "He made an ironic smile frown.They talked a few minutes about Pham Nuwen, and then Grondr rang off.Afterwards, Ravna took a walk along her beach.The sun was well down toward the aft horizon, and the sand was just pleasantly warm against her feet; the Docks went round the planet once every twenty hours, circling the pole at about forty degrees north latitude.She walked close to the surf, where the sand was flat and wet.The mist off the sea was moist against her skin.The blue sky just above the white tops shaded quickly to indigo and black.Specks of silver moved up there, agrav floaters bringing starships into the Docks.The whole thing was so fabulously, unnecessarily expensive.Ravna was by turns grossed out and bedazzled.Yet after two years at Relay, she was beginning to see the point.Vrinimi Org wanted the Beyond to know that it had the resources to handle whatever communication and archive demands might be made on it.And they wanted the Beyond to suspect that there were hidden gifts from the Transcend here, things that might make it more than a little dangerous to invaders.She stared into the spray, feeling it bead on her lashes.So Grondr had the big problem right now: how do you tell a Power to take a walk?All Ravna Bergsndot had to worry about was one overconfident twit who seemed hell bent on destroying himself.She turned and paralleled the water.Every third wave it surged over her ankles.She sighed.Pham Nuwen was beyond doubt a twit but what an awesome one.Intellectually, she had always known that there was no difference in the possible intelligence of Beyonders and the primitives of the Slowness.Most automation worked better in the Beyond; ultralight communication was possible.But you had to go to the Transcend to build truly superhuman minds.So it shouldn't be surprising that Pham Nuwen was capable.Very capable.He had picked up Triskweline with incredible ease.She had little doubt that he was the master skipper he claimed.And to be a trader in the Slowness, to risk centuries between the stars for a destination that might have fallen from civilization or become deadly hostile to outsiders that took courage that was hard to imagine.She could understand how he might think going to the Transcend was just another challenge.He'd had less than twenty days to absorb a whole new universe.That simply wasn't enough time to understand that the rules change when the players are more than human.Well, he still had a few days of grace.She would change his mind.And after talking to Grondr just now, she wouldn't feel especially guilty about doing it.The Foreign Quarter was actually about a third of the Docks.It abutted the no atmosphere periphery  where ships actually docked  and extended inwards to a section of the central sea.Vrinimi Org had convinced a significant number of races that this was a wonder of the Middle Beyond.In addition to freight traffic there were tourists  some of the wealthiest beings in the Beyond.Pham Nuwen had carte blanche to these amusements.Ravna took him through the more spectacular ones, including an agrav hop over the Docks.The barbarian was more impressed by their pocket space suits than by the Docks."I've seen structures bigger than that down in the Slowness. "Not hovering in a planetary gravity well, you haven't.Pham Nuwen seemed to mellow as the evening progressed.At least his comments became more perceptive, less edged.He wanted to see how real traders lived in the Beyond, and Ravna showed him the bourses and the traders' Local.They ended up in The Wandering Company just after Docks midnight.This was not Organization territory, but it was one of Ravna's favorite places, a private dive that attracted traders from the Top to the Bottom.She wondered how the decor would appeal to Pham Nuwen.The place was modeled as a meeting lodge on some world of the Slow Zone.A three meter model ramscoop hung in the air over the main service floor.Blue green drive fields glowed from the ship's every corner and flange, and spread faintly among patrons sitting below.To Ravna the walls and floors were heavy timber, rough cut.People like Egravan saw stone walls and narrow tunnels  the sort of broodery his race had maintained on new conquests of long ago.The trickery was optical  not some mental smudging  and about the best that could be done in the Middle Beyond.Ravna and Pham walked between widely spaced tables.The owners weren't as successful with sound as with vision: the music was faint and changed from table to table.Smells changed too, and were a little bit harder to take.Air management was working hard to keep everyone healthy, if not completely comfortable.Tonight the place was crowded.At the far end of the service floor, the special atmosphere nooks were occupied: low pressure, high pressure, high NOx, aquaria.Some customers were vague blurs within turbid atmospheres.In some ways it might have been a port bar at Sjandra Kei.Yet this was Relay.It attracted High Beyonders who would never come to backwaters like Sjandra Kei.Most of the High Ones didn't look very strange; civilizations at the Top were most often just colonies from below.But the headbands she saw here were not jewelry.Mind computer links aren't efficient in the Middle Beyond, but most of the High Beyonders would not give them up.Ravna started toward a group of banded tripods and their machines.Let Pham Nuwen talk with creatures who teetered on the edge of transsapience.Surprisingly, he touched her arm, drawing her back."Let's walk around a little more. "He was looking all around the hall, as if searching for a familiar face."Let's find some other humans first. "When holes showed in Pham Nuwen's cram education, they were gapingly wide.Ravna tried to keep her face serious."Other humans?We're all there is at Relay, Pham. ""But the friends you've been telling me about Egravan, Sarale?"Ravna just shook her head.For a moment the barbarian looked vulnerable.Pham Nuwen had spent his life crawling at sublight between human colonized star systems.She knew that in all that life he had seen only three non human races.Now he was lost in a sea of alienness.She kept her sympathy to herself; this one insight might affect the guy more than all her arguing.But the instant passed, and he was smiling again."Even more an adventure. "They left the main floor and walked past special atmosphere nooks."Lord, but Qeng Ho would love this. "No humans anywhere, and The Wandering Company was the homiest meeting place she knew; many Org customers met only on the Net.She felt her own homesickness welling up.On the second floor, a signet flag caught her eye.She'd known something like it back at Sjandra Kei.She drew Pham Nuwen across the floor, and started up the timbered stairs.Out of the background murmur, she heard a high pitched twittering.It wasn't Triskweline, but the words made sense!By the Powers, it was Samnorsk: "I do believe it's a Homo Sap!Over here, my lady. "She followed the sound to the table with the signet flag."May we sit with you?"she asked, savoring the familiar language."Please do. "The twitterer looked like a small ornamental tree sitting in a six wheeled cart.The cart was marked with cosmetic stripes and tassels; its 150 by 120 centimeter topside was covered with a cargo scarf in the same pattern as the signet flag.The creature was a Greater Skroderider.Its race traded through much of the Middle Beyond, including Sjandra Kei.The Skroderider's high pitched voice came from its voder.But speaking Samnorsk, it sounded homier than anything she'd heard in a long time.Even granting the mental peculiarities of Skroderiders, she felt a surge of affectionate nostalgia, as if she had run into a old classmate in a far city."My name is  " the sound was the rustling of fronds, "but you can easier call me Blueshell.It's nice to see a familiar face, hahaha. "Blueshell spoke the laughter as words.Pham Nuwen had sat down with Ravna, but he understood not a word of Samnorsk and so the great reunion was lost on him.The Rider switched to Triskweline and introduced his four companions: another Skroderider, and three humanoids who seemed to like the shadows.None of the humanoids spoke Samnorsk, but no one was more than one translator hop from Triskweline.The Skroderiders were owners/operators of a small interstellar freighter, the Out of Band II.The humanoids were certificants for part of the starship's current cargo."My mate and I have been in the business almost two hundred years.We have happy feelings for your race, my lady.Our first runs were between Sjandra Kei and Forste Utgrep.Your people are good customers and we scarcely ever have a shipment rot" He wheeled his skrode back from the table and then drove forward  the equivalent of a small bow.All was not sweetness and light, however.One of the humanoids spoke.The sounds could almost have come from a human throat, though they made no sense.A moment passed as the house translator processed his words.Then the broach on his jacket spoke in clear Triskweline: "Blueshell states you are Homo sapiens.Know that you have our animosity.We are bankrupt, near stranded here by your race's evil creation.The Straumli Perversion. "The words sounded emotionless, but Ravna could see the creature's tense posture, its fingers twisting at a drink bulb.Considering his attitude, it probably wouldn't help to point out that though she was human, Sjandra Kei was thousands of light years from Straum."You came here from the Realm?"she asked the Skroderider.Blueshell didn't answer immediately.That's the way it was with his race; he was probably trying to remember who she was and what they were all talking about.Then: "Yes, yes.Please do excuse my certificants' hostility.Our main cargo is a one time cryptographic pad.The source is Commercial Security at Sjandra Kei; the destination is the certificants' High colony.It was the usual arrangement: We're carrying a one third xor of the pad.Independent shippers are carrying the others.At the destination, the three parts would be xor'd together.The result could supply a dozen worlds' crypto needs on the Net for  "  Downstairs there was a commotion.Someone was smoking something a bit too strong for the air scrubbers.Ravna caught a whiff, enough to shimmer her vision.It had knocked out several patrons on the main level.Management was counseling the offending customer.Blueshell made an abrupt noise.He backed his skrode from the table and rolled to the railing."Don't want to be caught unawares.Some people can be so abrupt" When nothing more came of the incident, he returned."Uh, where was I?"He was silent a moment, consulting the short term memory built into his skrode."Yes, yes We would become relatively rich if our plans work out.Unfortunately, we stopped on Straum to drop off some bulk data. "He pivoted on his rear four wheels."Surely that was safe?Straum is more than a hundred light years from their lab in the Transcend.Yet  "  One of the certificants interrupted with loud gabble.The house translator kicked in a moment later: "Yes.It should have been safe.We saw no violence.Ship's recorders show that our safeness was not breached.Yet now there are rumors.Net groups claim that Straumli Realm is owned by perversion.Absurdity.Yet these rumors have crossed the Net to our destination.Our cargo is not trusted, so our cargo is ruined: now it is only a few grams of data medium carrying random  " In the middle of the flat voiced translation, the humanoid lunged out of the shadows.Ravna had a glimpse of a jaw edged with razor sharp gums.He threw his drink bulb at the table in front of her.Pham Nuwen's hand flashed out, snatching the drink before it hit  before she had quite realized what was happening.The redhead came slowly to his feet.From the shadows, the two other humanoids came to their feet and moved toward their friend.Pham Nuwen didn't say a word.He set the bulb carefully down and leaned just slightly toward the other, his hands relaxed yet bladelike.Cheap fiction talks about "looks of deadly menace".Ravna had never expected to see the real thing.But the humanoids saw it too.They tugged their friend gently back from the table.The loudmouth did not resist, but once beyond Pham's reach he erupted in a barrage of squeals and hisses that left the house translator speechless.He made a sharp gesture with three fingers, and shut up.The three swept silently down the stairs and away.Pham Nuwen sat down, his gray eyes calm and untroubled.Maybe he did have something to be arrogant about!Ravna looked across at the two Skroderiders."I'm sorry your cargo lost value. "Most of Ravna's past contacts had been with Lesser Skroderiders, whose reflexes were only slightly augmented beyond their sessile heritage.Had these two even noticed the interruption?But Blueshell answered immediately, "Do not apologize.Ever since our arrival, those three have been complaining.Contract partners or not, I'm very tired of them. "He lapsed into potted plant mode.After a moment, the other Rider  Greenstalk, was it?spoke."Besides, our commercial situation may not be a complete failure.I am sure the other thirds of the shipment went nowhere near Straumli Realm. "That was the usual procedure anyway: each part of the shipment was carried by a different company, each taking a very different path.If the other thirds could be certified, the crew of the Out of Band might not come away empty handed."In  in fact, there may be a way we can get full certification.True, we were at Straumli Main, but  "  "How long ago did you leave?""Six hundred and fifty hours ago.About two hundred hours after they dropped off the Net. "It suddenly dawned on Ravna that she was talking to something like eyewitnesses.After thirty days, the Threats news was still dominated by the events at Straum.The consensus was that a Class Two perversion had been created  even Vrinimi Org believed that.Yet it was still mainly guesswork And here she was talking to beings who had actually been there."You don't think the Straumers created a perversion?"It was Blueshell who replied."Sigh," he said."Our certificants deny it, but I see a problem of conscience here.We did witness strangeness on Straum Have you ever encountered artificial immune systems?The ones that work in the Middle Beyond are more trouble than they're worth, so perhaps not.I noticed a real change in certain officers of the Crypto Authority right after the Straumli victory.It was as if they were suddenly part of a poorly calibrated automation, as if they were somebody's, um, fingers No one can doubt they were playing in the Transcend.They found something up there; a lost archive.But that is not the point. "He stopped talking for a long moment; Ravna almost thought he was finished."You see, just before leaving Straumli Main, we  "  But now Pham Nuwen was talking too."That's something I've been wondering about.Everybody talks as though this Straumli Realm was doomed the moment they began research in the Transcend.Look.I've played with bugged software and strange weapons.I know you can get killed that way.But it looks like the Straumers were careful to put their lab far away.They were building something that could go very wrong, but apparently it was a previously tried experiment  like just about everything Up Here.They could stop the work any time it deviated from the records, right up to the end.So how could they screw up so bad?"The question stopped the Skroderider in its tracks.You didn't need a doctorate in Applied Theology to know the answer.Even the damn Straumers should have known the answer.But given Pham Nuwen's background, it was a reasonable question.Ravna kept her mouth shut.The Skroderider's very alienness might be more convincing to Pham than another lecture from her.Blueshell dithered for a moment, no doubt using his skrode to help assemble his arguments.When he finally spoke, he didn't seem irritated by the interruption."I hear several misconceptions, My Lady Pham. "He seemed to use the old Nyjoran honorific pretty indiscriminately."Have you been into the archive at Relay?"Pham said yes.Ravna guessed he'd never been past the beginners' front end."Then you know that an archive is a fundamentally vaster thing than the database on a conventional local net.For practical purposes the big ones can't even be duplicated.The major archives go back millions of years, have been maintained by hundreds of different races  most now extinct or Transcended into Powers.Even the archive at Relay is a jumble, so huge that indexing systems are laid on top of indexing systems.Only in the Transcend could such a mass be well organized and even then only the Powers could understand it. ""So?""There are thousands of archives in the Beyond  tens of thousands if you count the ones that have fallen into disrepair or dropped off the Net.Along with unending trivia, they contain important secrets and important lies.There are traps and snares. "Millions of races played with the advice that filtered unsolicited across the Net.Tens of thousands had been burned thereby.Sometimes the damage was relatively minor, good inventions that weren't quite right for the target environment.Sometimes it was malicious, viruses that would jam a local net so thoroughly that a civilization must restart from scratch.Where Are They Now and Threats carried stories of worse tragedies: planets kneedeep in replicant goo, races turned brainless by badly programmed immune systems.Pham Nuwen was wearing his skeptical expression."Just test the stuff at a safe remove.Be prepared for local disasters. "That would have brought most explanations to a stop.Ravna had to admire the Skroderider: he paused, retreated to still more elementary terms."True, simple caution can prevent many disasters.And if your lab is in the Middle or Low Beyond, such caution is all that is really needed  no matter how sophisticated the threat.But we all understand the nature of the Zones" Ravna had virtually no feel for Rider body language, but she would have sworn that Blueshell was watching the barbarian expectantly, trying to gauge the depth of Pham's ignorance.The human nodded impatiently.Blueshell continued, "In the Transcend, truly sophisticated equipment can operate, devices substantially smarter than anyone down here.Of course, almost any economic or military competition can be won by the side with superior computing resources.Such can be had at the Top of the Beyond and in the Transcend.Races are always migrating there, hoping to build their utopias.But what do you do when your new creations may be smarter than you are?It happens that there are limitless possibilities for disaster, even if an existing Power does not cause harm.So there are unnumbered recipes for safely taking advantage of the Transcend.Of course they can't be effectively examined except in the Transcend.And run on devices of their own description, the recipes themselves become sentient. "Understanding was beginning to glimmer across Pham Nuwen's face.Ravna leaned forward, caught the redhead's attention."There are complex things in the archives.None of them is sentient, but some have the potential, if only some naive young race will believe their promises.We think that's what happened to Straumli Realm.They were tricked by documentation that claimed miracles, tricked into building a transcendent being, a Power  but one that victimizes sophonts in the Beyond. "She didn't mention how rare such perversion was.The Powers were variously malevolent, playful, indifferent  but virtually all of them had better uses for their time than exterminating cockroaches in the wild.Pham Nuwen rubbed his jaw thoughtfully."Okay, I guess I see.But I get the feeling this is common knowledge.If it's this deadly, how did the Straumli bunch get taken in?""Bad luck and criminal incompetence," the words popped out of her with surprising force.She hadn't realized she was so bent by the Straumli thing; somewhere inside, her old feelings for Straumli Realm were still alive."Look.Operations in the High Beyond and in the Transcend are dangerous.Civilizations up there don't last long, but there will always be people who try.Very few of the threats are actively evil.What happened to the Straumers They ran across this recipe advertising wondrous treasure.Quite possibly it had been lying around for millions of years, a little too risky for other folks to try.You're right, the Straumers knew the dangers. "But it was a classic situation of balancing risks and choosing wrong.Perhaps a third of Applied Theology was about how to dance near the flame without getting incinerated.No one knew the details of the Straumli debacle, but she could guess them from a hundred similar cases:  "So they set up a base in the Transcend at this lost archive  if that's what it was.They began implementing the schemes they found.You can be sure they spent most of their time watching it for signs of deception.No doubt the recipe was a series of more or less intelligible steps with a clear takeoff point.The early stages would involve computers and programs more effective than anything in the Beyond  but apparently well behaved. "" Yeah.Even in the Slowness, a big program can be full of surprises. "Ravna nodded."And some of these would be near or beyond human complexity.Of course, the Straumers would know this and try to isolate their creations.But given a malign and clever design it should be no surprise if the devices leaked onto the lab's local net and distorted the information there.From then on, the Straumer's wouldn't have a chance.The most cautious staffers would be framed as incompetent.Phantom threats would be detected, emergency responses demanded.More sophisticated devices would be built, and with fewer safeguards.Conceivably, the humans were killed or rewritten before the Perversion even achieved transsapience. "There was a long silence.Pham Nuwen looked almost chastened.Yeah.There's a lot you don't know, Buddy.Think on what Old One might have planned for you.Blueshell bent a tendril to taste a brown concoction that smelled like seaweed."Well told, My Lady Ravna.But there is one difference in the present situation.It may be good fortune, and very important You see, just before leaving Straumli Main, we attended a beach party among the Lesser Riders.They had been little affected by events to that point; many hadn't even noticed the destruction of independence at Straum.With luck, they may be the last enslaved. "His squeaky voice lowered an octave, trailing into silence."Where was I?Yes, the party.There was one fellow there, a bit more lively than the average.Somewhere years past, he had bonded with a traveler in a Straumli news service.Now he was acting as a clandestine data drop, so humble that he wasn't even listed in that service's own net  "Anyway, the researchers at the Straumli lab  a few of them at least  were not so incautious as you say.They suspected a perverse runaway, and were determined to sabotage it. "This was news, but  "Doesn't look like they had much success, does it?""I am nodding agreement.They did not prevent it, but they did plan to escape the laboratory planet with two starships.And they did get word of their attempt into channels that ended with my acquaintance at the beach party.And here is the important part: At least one of these ships was to carry away some final elements of the Perversion's recipe  before they were incorporated into the design. ""Surely there were backups  " began Pham Nuwen.Ravna waved him silent.There had been enough grade school explanations for one night.This was incredible.She'd been following the news about Straumli Realm as much as anyone.The Realm was the first High daughter colony of Sjandra Kei; it was horrifying to see it destroyed.But nowhere in Threats had there been even a rumor of this: the Perversion not whole?"If this is true, then the Straumers may have a chance.It all depends on the missing parts of the design document. ""Just so.And of course the humans realized this too.They planned to head straight for the Bottom of the Beyond, rendezvous there with their accomplices from Straum. "Which  considering the ultimate magnitude of the disaster  would never happen.Ravna leaned back, oblivious of Pham Nuwen for the first time in many hours.Most likely both ships had been destroyed by now.If not  well, the Straumers had been at least half smart, heading for the Bottom.If they had what Blueshell thought, the Perversion would be very interested in finding them.It was no wonder Blueshell and Greenstalk hadn't announced this on the news groups."So you know where they were going to rendezvous?"she said softly."Approximately. "Greenstalk burred something at him."Not in ourselves," he said."The coordinates are in the safeness at our ship.But there is more.The Straumers had a backup plan if the rendezvous failed.They intended to signal Relay with their ship's ultrawave. ""Now wait.Just how big is this ship?"Ravna was no physical layer engineer, but she knew that Relay's backbone transceivers were actually swarms of antenna elements scattered across several light years, each element ten thousand kilometers across.Blueshell rolled forward and back, a quick gesture of agitation."We don't know, but it's nothing exceptional.Unless you're looking precisely at it with a large antenna, you'd never detect it from here. "Greenstalk added, "We think that was part of their plan, though it is desperation on top of desperation.Since we came to Relay, we've been talking to the Org  "  "Discreetly!Quietly!"Blueshell put in abruptly."Yes.We've asked the Organization to listen for this ship.I'm afraid we haven't talked to the right people.No one seems to put much credence in us.After all, the story is ultimately from a Lesser Rider," Yeah.What could they know that was under a hundred years old?"What we're asking would normally be a great expense, and apparently prices are especially high right now. "Ravna tried to curb her enthusiasm.If she had read this in a newsgroup, it would've been just one more interesting rumor.Why should she boggle just because she was getting it face to face?By the Powers, what irony.Hundreds of customers from the Top and the Transcend  even Old One  were saturating Relay's resources with their curiosity about the Straumli debacle.What if the answer had been sitting in front of them, suppressed by the very eagerness of their investigation?"Just who have you been talking to?Never mind, never mind. "Maybe she should just go to Grondr 'Kalir with the story."I think you should know that I am a  " very minor! "employee of the Vrinimi Organization.I may be able to help. "She had expected some surprise at this sudden good luck.Instead there was a pause.Apparently Blueshell had lost his place in the conversation.Finally Greenstalk spoke."I am blushing You see, we knew that.Blueshell looked you up in the employees' directory; you are the only human in the Org.You're not in Customer Contact, but we thought that if we chanced upon you, so to speak, you might give us a kindly hearing. "Blueshell's tendrils rustled together sharply.Irritation?Or had he finally caught up to the conversation?"Yes.Well, since we are all being so frank, I suppose we should confess that this might even benefit us.If the refugee ship can prove that the Perversion is not a full Class Two, then perhaps we can convince our buyers that our cargo has not been compromised.If they only knew, my certificant friends would be groveling at your feet, my lady Ravna. "They stayed at The Wandering Company until well past midnight.Business picked up at the circadian peak of some of the new arrivals.Floor and table shows were raucous all around.Pham's eyes flickered this way and that, taking it all in.But above all he seemed fascinated by Blueshell and Greenstalk.The two were starkly nonhuman, in some ways even strange as aliens go.Skroderiders were one of the very few races that had achieved long term stability in the Beyond.Speciation had long ago occurred, varieties heading outward or becoming extinct.And still there were some who matched their ancient skrodes, a unique balance of outlook and machine interface that was more than a billion years old.But Blueshell and Greenstalk were also traders with much of the outlook that Pham Nuwen had known in the Slowness.And though Pham acted as ignorant as ever, there was new diplomacy in him.Or maybe the awesomeness of the Beyond was finally getting through his thick skull.He couldn't have asked for better drinking buddies.As a race, the Skroderiders preferred lazy reminiscence to almost any activity.Once delivered of their critical message, the two were quite content to talk of their life in the Beyond, to explain things in whatever detail the barbarian could wish.The razor jawed certificants stayed well lost.Ravna got a mild buzz on, and watched the three talk shop.She smiled to herself.In a way, she was the outsider now, the person who had never done.Blueshell and Greenstalk had been all over, and some of their stories sounded wild even to her.Ravna had a theory (not that widely accepted, actually) that where beings have a common fluency, little else matters.Two of these three might be mistaken for potted trees on hotcarts, and the third was unlike any human in her life.Their fluency was in an artificial language, and two of the "voices" were squawky raspings.Yet after a few minutes' listening, their personalities seemed to float in her mind's eye, more interesting than many of her school chums, but not that different.The two Skroderiders were mates.She hadn't thought that could count for much; among Riders, sex amounted to scarcely more than being next door neighbors at the right time of year.Yet there was deep affection here.Greenstalk especially seemed a loving personality.She (he?)was shy yet stubborn, with a kind of honesty that might be a major handicap in a trader.Blueshell made up for that failing.He (she?)could be glib and talkative, quite capable of maneuvering things his way.Underneath, Ravna glimpsed a compulsive personality, uncomfortable with his own sneakiness, ultimately grateful when Greenstalk reined him in.And what of Pham Nuwen?Yes, what's the inner being you see there?In an odd way, he was more of a mystery.The arrogant boob of this afternoon seemed to be mostly invisible tonight.Maybe it had been a cover for insecurity.The fellow had been born in a male dominated culture, virtually the opposite of the matriarchy that all Beyonder humanity descended from.Underneath the arrogance, a very nice person might be living.Then there was the way he had faced down razor jaw.And the way he was drawing out the Skroderiders.It occurred to Ravna that after a lifetime of reading romantic fiction, she had run into her first hero.It was after 02:30 when they left The Wandering Company.The sun would be rising across the bow horizon in less than five hours.The two Skroderiders came outside to see them off.Blueshell had switched back to Samnorsk to regale Ravna with a story of his last visit to Sjandra Kei  and remind her to ask about the refugee ship.The Skroderiders dwindled beneath them as Ravna and Pham rose into the thinning air and headed toward the residential towers.The two humans didn't say anything for a couple of minutes.It was even possible that Pham Nuwen was impressed by the view.They were passing over gaps in the brightly lit Docks, places where they could see through the parks and concourses to the surface of Groundside a thousand kilometers below.The clouds there were whorls of dark on dark.Ravna's residence was at the outer edge of the Docks.Here the air fountains were of no use; her apartment tower rose into frank vacuum.They glided down to her balcony, trading their suits' atmosphere for the apartment's.Ravna's mouth was leading a life of its own, explaining how the residence was what she'd been assigned when she worked at the archive, that it is was nothing compared to her new office.Pham Nuwen nodded, quiet faced.There were none of the smart remarks of their earlier tours.She babbled on, and then they were inside and She shut up, and they just looked at each other.In a way, she'd wanted this clown ever since Grondr's silly animation.But it wasn't till this evening at The Wandering Company that she'd felt right about bringing him home with her."Well, I, uh  " So.Ravna, the ravening princess.Where is your glib tongue now?She settled for reaching out, putting her hand on his.Pham Nuwen smiled back, shy too, by the Powers!"I think you have a nice place," he said."I've decorated it Techno Primitive.Being stuck at the edge of the Docks has its points: The natural view isn't messed up by city lights.Here, I'll show you. "She doused the lights and pulled the curtains aside.The window was a natural transparency, looking out from the edge of the Docks.The view tonight should be terrific.On the ride from The Company, the sky had been awfully dark.The in system factories must be off line or hidden behind Groundside.Even ship traffic seemed sparse.She went back to stand by Pham.The window was a vague rectangle across her vision."You have to wait a minute for your eyes to adjust.There's no amplification at all. "The curve of Groundside was clear now, clouds with occasional pricks of light.She slipped her arm across his back, and after a moment felt his across her shoulders.She'd guessed right: tonight, the Galaxy owned the sky.It was a sight that Vrinimi old hands happily ignored.For Ravna, it was the most beautiful thing about Relay.Without enhancement, the light was faint.Twenty thousand light years is a long, long way.At first there was just a suggestion of mist, and an occasional star.As her eyes adapted, the mist took shape, curving arcs, some places brighter, some dimmer.A minute more and there were knots in the mist there were streaks of utter black that separated the curving arms complexity on complexity, twisting toward the pale hub that was the Core.Maelstrom.Whirlpool.Frozen, still, across half the sky.She heard Pham's breath catch in his throat.He said something, sing song syllables that could not have been Trisk, and certainly not Samnorsk."All my life I lived in a tiny clump of that.And I thought I was a master of space.I never dreamed to stand and see the whole blessed thing at once. "His hand tightened on her shoulder, then gentled, stroking her neck."And no matter how long we watch, will we see any sign of the Zones?"She shook her head slowly."But they're easily imagined. "She gestured with her free hand.In the large, the Zones of Thought followed the mass distribution of the Galaxy: The Mindless Depths extending down to the soft glow of the galactic Core.Farther out, the Great Slowness, where humankind had been born, where ultralight could not exist and civilizations lived and died unknowing and unknown.And the Beyond, the stars about four fifths out from the center, extending well off plane to include places like Relay.The Known Net had existed in some form for billions of years in the Beyond.It was not a civilization; few civilizations lasted longer than a million years.But the records of the past were quite complete.Sometimes they were intelligible.More often, reading them involved translations of translations of translations, passed down from one defunct race to another with no one to corroborate  worse than any multihop net message could ever be.Yet some things were quite clear: There had always been the Zones of Thought, though perhaps they were slightly inward moved now.There had always been wars and peace, and races upwelling from the Great Slowness, and thousands of little empires.There had always been races moving into the Transcend, to become the Powers or their prey."And the Transcend?"Pham said."Is that just the far dark?"The dark between the galaxies.Ravna laughed softly."It includes all that but see the outer reaches of the spirals.They're in the Transcend. "Most everything farther than forty thousand light years from the galactic center was.Pham Nuwen was silent for a long moment.She felt a tiny shiver pass through him."After talking to the wheelies, I  I think I understand more of what you were warning me about.There's a lot of things I don't know, things that could kill me or worse. "Common sense triumphs at last."True," she said quietly."But it's not just you, or the brief time you've been here.You could study your whole life, and not know.How long must a fish study to understand human motivation?It's not a good analogy, but it's the only safe one; we are like dumb animals to the Powers of the Transcend.Think of all the different things people do to animals  ingenious, sadistic, charitable, genocidal  each has a million elaborations in the Transcend.The Zones are a natural protection; without them, human equivalent intelligence would probably not exist. "She waved at the misty star swarms."The Beyond and below are like a deep of ocean, and we the creatures that swim in the abyss.We're so far down that the beings on the surface  superior though they are  can't effectively reach us.Oh, they fish, and they sometimes blight the upper levels with poisons we don't even understand.But the abyss remains a relatively safe place. "She paused.There was more to the analogy."And just as with an ocean, there is a constant drift of flotsam from the top.There are things that can only be made at the Top, that need close to sentient factories  but which can still work down here.Blueshell mentioned some of those when he was talking to you: the agrav fabrics, the sapient devices.Such things are the greatest physical wealth of the Beyond, since we can't make them.And getting them is a deadly risky endeavor. "Pham turned toward her, away from window and the stars."So there are always 'fish' edging close to the surface. "For an instant she thought she had lost him, that he was caught by the romance of the Transcendent deathwish."Little fish risking everything for a piece of godhood and not knowing heaven from hell, even when they find it. "She felt him shiver and then his arms were around her.She tilted her head up and found his lips waiting.It had been two years since Ravna Bergsndot left Sjandra Kei.In some ways the time had gone fast.Just now her body was telling her what a long, long time it had really been.Every touch was so vivid, waking desires carefully suppressed.Suddenly her skin was tingling all over.It took marvelous restraint to undress without tearing anything.Ravna was out of practice.And of course she had nothing recent to compare to But Pham Nuwen was very, very good.Crypto: 0  As received by: Transceiver Relay01 at Relay  Language path: Acquileron Triskweline, SjK:Relay units  From: Net Administrator for Transceiver Windsong at Debley Down  Subject: Complaints about Relay, a suggestion  Summary: It's getting worse; try us instead  Key phrases: communications problems, Relay unreliability, Transcend  Distribution:  Communication Costs Special Interest Group, Motley Hatch Administration Group, Transceiver Relay01 at Relay, Transceiver Not for Long at Shortstop,  Follow ups to: Windsong Expansion Interest Group  Date: 07:21:21 Docks Time, 36/09 of Org year 52089  Text of message:  During the last five hundred hours, Comm Costs shows 9,834 transceiver layer congestion complaints against the Vrinimi operation at Relay.Each of these complaints involves services to tens of thousand of planets.Vrinimi has promised again and again that the congestion is a purely temporary increase of Transcendent usage.As Relay's chief competitor in this region, we of Windsong have benefited modestly from the overflow; however, until now we thought it inappropriate to propose a coordinated response to the problem.The events of the last seven hours compel us to change this policy.Those reading this item already know about the incident; most of you are the victims of it.Beginning at [00:00:27 Docks Time], Vrinimi Org began taking transceivers off line, an unscheduled outage.R01 went out at 00:00:27, R02 at 02:50:32, R03 and R04 at 03:12:01.Vrinimi stated that a Transcendent customer was urgently requesting bandwidth.(R00 had been previously dedicated to that Power's use. )The customer required use of both up and down link bandwidth.By the Org's own admission, the unscheduled usage exceeded sixty percent of their entire capacity.Note that the excesses of the preceding five hundred hours  excesses which caused entirely justified complaint  were never more than five percent of Org capacity.Friends, we of Windsong are in the long haul communication business.We know how difficult it is to maintain transceiver elements that mass as much as a planet.We know that hard contract commitments simply cannot be made by suppliers in our line of work.But at the same time, the behavior of Vrinimi Org is unacceptable.It's true that in the last three hours the Org has returned R01 through R04 to general service, and promised to pass on the Power's surpayment to all those who were "inconvenienced".But only Vrinimi knows how large these surpayments really are.And no one (not even Vrinimi!)knows whether this is the end of the outages.What is to Vrinimi a sudden, incredible cash glut, is to the rest of you an unaccountable disaster.Therefore Windsong at Debley Down is considering a major  and permanent  expansion of our service: the construction of five additional backbone transceivers.Obviously this will be immensely expensive.Transceivers are never cheap, and Debley Down does not have quite the geometry enjoyed by Relay.We expect the cost must be amortized over many decades of good business.We can't undertake it without clear customer commitment.In order to determine this demand, and to ensure that we build what is really needed, we are creating a temporary newsgroup, Windsong Expansion Interest Group, moderated and archived at Windsong.Send/Receive charges to transceiver layer customers on this group will be only ten percent our usual.We urge you, our transceiver layer customers, to use this service to talk to each other, to decide what you can safely expect from Vrinimi Org in the future and how you feel about our proposals.We are waiting to hear from you.Afterwards, Ravna slept well.It was halfway through the morning when she drifted back toward wakefulness.The ring of her phone was monotonously insistent, loud enough to reach through the most pleasant dreams.She opened her eyes, disoriented and happy.She was lying with her arms wrapped tightly around a large pillow.Damn.He'd already left.She lay back for a second, remembering.These last two years she had been lonely; till last night she hadn't realized how lonely.Happiness so unexpected, so intense   what a strange thing.The phone just kept ringing.Finally she rolled out of bed and walked unsteadily across the room; there should be limits to this Techno Primitive nonsense."Yes?"It was a Skroderider.Greenstalk?"I'm sorry to bother you, Ravna, but  are you all right?"The Rider interrupted herself.Ravna suddenly realized that she might be looking a little strange: sappy smile spread from ear to ear, hair sticking out in all directions.She rubbed her hand across her mouth, cutting back laughter."Yes, I'm fine. "Fine!"What's up?""We want to thank you for your help.We had never dreamed that you were so highly placed.We'd been trying for hundreds of hours to persuade the Org to listen for the refugees.But less than an hour after talking to you, we were told the survey is being undertaken immediately. ""Um. "Say what?"That's wonderful, but I'm not sure I  who's paying for it, anyway?""I don't know, but it is expensive.We were told they're dedicating a backbone transceiver to the search.If there's anyone transmitting, we should know in a matter of hours. "They chatted for a few more minutes, Ravna gradually becoming more coherent as she parceled the various aspects of the last ten hours into business and pleasure.She had half expected the Org to bug her at The Wandering Company.Maybe Grondr just heard the story there  and gave it full credit.But just yesterday, he'd been wimping about transceiver saturation.Either way, this was good news  perhaps extraordinarily good.If the Riders' wild story were true, the Straumli Perversion might be less than Transcendent.And if the refugee ships had some clues on how to bring it down, Straumli Realm might even be saved.After Greenstalk rang off, Ravna wandered about the apartment, getting herself in shape, playing the various possibilities against each other.Her actions became more purposeful, almost up to their usual speed.There were a lot of things she wanted to check into.Then the phone was ringing again.This time she previewed the caller.Oops!It was Grondr Vrinimikalir.She combed her hand back through her hair; it still looked like crap, and this phone was not up to deception.Suddenly she noticed that Grondr didn't look so hot either.His facial chitin was smudged, even across some of his freckles.She accepted the call."Ah!"His voice actually squeaked, then returned to its normal level."Thank you for answering.I would have called earlier, except things have been very chaotic. "Just where had his cool distance gone?"I just want you to know that the Org had nothing to do with this.We were totally taken in until just a couple of hours ago. "He launched into a disjointed description of massive demand swamping the Org's resources.As he rambled, Ravna punched up a summary of recent Relay business.By the Powers that Be: Sixty percent diversion?Excerpts from Comm Costs: She scanned quickly down the item from Windsong.The gasbags were as pompous as ever, but their offer to replace Relay was probably for real.It was just the sort of thing Grondr had been afraid might happen.   "Old One just kept asking for more and more.When we finally figured things out, and confronted him Well, we came close to threatening violence.We have the resources to destroy his emissary vessel.No telling what his revenge might be, but we told Old One his demands were already destroying us.Thank the Powers, he just seemed amused; he backed off.He's restricted to a single transceiver now, and that's on a signal search that has nothing to do with us. "Hmm.One mystery solved.Old One must have been snooping around The Wandering Company and overheard the Skroderiders' story."Maybe things will be okay, then.But it's important to be just as tough if Old One tries to abuse us again. "The words were already out of her mouth before she considered who she was giving advice to.Grondr didn't seem to notice.If anything, he was the one scrambling to agree: "Yes, yes.I'll tell you, if Old One were any ordinary customer, we'd blacklist him forever for this deception But then if he were ordinary, he could never have fooled us. "Grondr wiped pudgy white fingers across his face."No mere Beyonder could have altered our record of the dredge expedition.Not even one from the Top could have broken into the junkyard and manipulated the remains without our even suspecting. "Dredge?Remains?Ravna began to see that she and Grondr were not talking about the same thing."Just what did Old One do?""The details?We're pretty sure of them now.Since the Fall of Straum, Old One has been very interested in humans.Unfortunately, there were no willing ones available here.It began manipulating us, rewriting our junkyard records.We've recovered a clean backup from a branch office: The dredge really did encounter the wreck of a human ship; there were human body parts in it  but nothing that we could have revived.Old One must have mixed and matched what it found there.Perhaps it fabricated memories by extrapolating from human cultural data in the archives.With hindsight, we can match its early requests with the invasion of our junkyard. "Grondr rattled on, but Ravna wasn't listening.Her eyes stared blindly through the phone's display.We are little fish in the abyss, protected by the deep from the fishers above.But even if they can't live down here, the clever fisherfolk still have their lures and deadly tricks.And so Pham  "Pham Nuwen is just a robot, then," she said softly."Not precisely.He is human, and with his fake memories he can operate autonomously.But when Old One buys full bandwidth, the creature is fully an emissary device. "The hand and eye of a Power.Grondr's mouthparts clattered in abject embarrassment."Ravna, we don't know all that happened last night; there was no reason to have you under close surveillance.But Old One assures us that its need for direct investigation is over.In any case, we'll never give him the bandwidth to try again. "Ravna barely nodded.Her face suddenly felt cold.She had never felt such anger and such fright at the same time.She stood in a wave of dizziness and walked away from the phone, ignoring Grondr's worried cries.The stories from grad school came tumbling through her mind, and the myths of a dozen human religions.Consequences, consequences.Some of them she could defend against; others were past repair.And from somewhere in the back of her mind, an incredibly silly thought crawled out from under the horror and the rage.For eight hours she had been face to face with a Power.It was the sort of experience that made a chapter in textbooks, the sort of thing that was always far away and misreported.And it was the sort of thing no one in all of Sjandra Kei could come near to claiming.Until now.Johanna was in the boat for a long time.The sun never set, though now it was low behind her, now it was high in front, now all was cloudy and rain plinked off the tarp covering her blankets.She spent the hours in an agonized haze.Things happened that could only have been dreams.There were creatures pulling at her clothes, blood sticking everywhere.Gentle hands and rat snouts dressed her wounds, and forced chill water down her throat.When she thrashed around, Mom rearranged her blankets and comforted her with the strangest sounds.For hours, someone warm lay beside her.Sometimes it was Jefri; more often it was a large dog, a dog that purred.The rain passed.The sun was on the left side of the boat, but hidden behind a cold, snapping shadow.More and more, the pain became divisible.Part of it was in her chest and shoulder; that stabbed through her whenever the boat wobbled.Part of it was in her gut, an emptiness that was not quite nausea she was so hungry, so thirsty.More and more, she was remembering, not dreaming.There were nightmares that would never go away.They had really happened.They were happening now.The sun peeked in and out of the tumble of clouds.It slid slowly lower across the sky till it was almost behind the boat.She tried to remember what Daddy had been saying just before everything went bad.They were in this planet's arctic, in the summer.So the sun's low point must be north, and their twin hulled boat was sailing roughly southwards.Wherever they were going, it was minute by minute farther from the spacecraft and any hope of finding Jefri.Sometimes the water was like open sea, the hills distant or hidden by low clouds.Sometimes they passed through narrows, and swept close to walls of naked rock.She'd had no idea a sailboat could move so fast or be so dangerous.Four of the rat creatures worked desperately to keep them off the rocks.They bounded nimbly from mast platform to railing, sometimes standing on each other's shoulders to extend their reach.The twin hulled boat tilted and groaned in water that was suddenly rough.Then they'd be through and the hills would be at a peaceful distance, sliding slowly past.For a long while, she pretended delirium.She moaned, she twisted.She watched.The boat hulls were long and narrow, almost like canoes.The sail was mounted between them.The shadow in her dreams had been that sail, snapping in the cold, clean wind.The sky was an avalanche of grays, light and dark.There were birds up there.They dipped past the mast, circled again and again.There was twittering and hissing all around her.But the sound did not come from the birds.It was the monsters.She watched them through lowered lashes.These were the same kind that killed Mom and Dad.They even wore the same funny clothes, gray green jackets studded with stirrups and pockets.Dogs or wolves she had thought before.That didn't really describe them.Sure, they had four slender legs and pointy little ears.But with their long necks and occasionally pinkish eyes, they might as well be huge rats.And the longer she watched them, the more horrible they seemed.A still image could never convey that horror; you had to see them in action.She watched four of them  the ones on her side of the boat  play with her dataset.The Pink Oliphaunt was tied in a net bag near the rear of the boat.Now the beasts wanted to look it over.At first it looked like a circus act, the creatures' heads darting this way and that.But every move was so precise, so coordinated with all the others.They had no hands, but they could untie knots, each holding a piece of twine in its mouth and maneuvering its necks around others.At the same time, one's claws held the loose netting tight against the railing.It was like watching puppets run off the same control.In seconds they had it out of the bag.Dogs would have let it slide to the bottom of the hull, then pushed it around with their noses.Not these things: two put it onto on a cross bench, while a third steadied it with its paw.They poked around the edges, concentrating on the plush flanges and floppy ears.They pushed and nuzzled, but with clear purpose.They were trying to open it.Two heads showed over the railing on the other hull.They made the gobbling, hissing sounds that were a cross between a bird call and someone throwing up.One of those on her side glanced back and made similar sounds.The other three continued to play with the dataset's latches.Finally they pulled the big, floppy ears simultaneously: the dataset popped open, and the top window went into Johanna's startup routine  an anim of herself saying "Shame on you, Jefri.Stay out of my things!"The four creatures went rigid, their eyes suddenly wide.Johanna's four turned the set so the others could see.One held it down while another peered at the top window, and a third fumbled with the key window.The guys in the other hull went nuts, but none of them tried to get any closer.The random prodding of the four abruptly cut off her startup greeting.One of them glanced at the guys in the other hull; another two watched Johanna.She continued to lie with her eyes almost closed."Shame on you, Jefri.Stay out my things!"Johanna's voice came again, but from one of the animals.It was a perfect playback.Then a girl's voice was moaning, crying, "Mom, Daddy".It was her own voice again, but more frightened and childish than she ever wanted it to sound.They seemed to be waiting for the dataset to respond.When nothing happened, one of them went back to pushing its nose against the windows.Everything valuable, and all the dangerous programs, were passworded.Insults and squawking emerged from the box, all the little surprises she had planted for her snooping little brother.Oh Jefri, will I ever see you again?The sounds and vids kept the monsters amused for several minutes.Eventually their random fiddlings convinced the dataset that somebody really young had opened up the box, and it shifted into kindermode.The creatures knew she was watching.Of the four fooling with her Oliphaunt, one  not always the same one  was always watching her.They were playing games with her, pretending they didn't know she was pretending.Johanna opened her eyes wide and glared at the creature."Damn you!"She looked in the other direction.And screamed.The mob in the other hull were clumped together.Their heads rose on sinuous necks from the pile.In the low sunlight, their eyes glinted red.A pack of rats or snakes, silently staring at her, and for heaven knew how long.The heads leaned forward at her cry, and she heard the scream again.Behind her, her own voice shouted "Damn you!"Somewhere else, she was calling for "Mom" and "Daddy".Johanna screamed again, and they just echoed it back.She swallowed her terror and kept silent.The monsters kept it up for a half minute, the mimicking, the mixing of things she must have said in her sleep.When they saw they couldn't terrorize her that way any more, the voices stopped being human.The gobbling went back and forth, as if the two groups were negotiating or something.Finally the four on her side closed her dataset and tied it into the net bag.The six unwrapped themselves from each other.Three jumped to the outboard side of the hull.They gripped the edge tight in their claws and leaned into the wind.For once they almost did look like dogs  big ones sitting at a car window, sniffing at the airstream.The long necks swept forward and back.Every few seconds, one of them would dip its head out of sight, into the water.Drinking?Fishing?Fishing.A head flipped up, tossing something small and green into the boat.The other three animals nosed about, grabbing it.She had a glimpse of tiny legs and a shiny carapace.One of the rats held it at the tip of its mouth, while the other two pulled it apart.It was all done with their uncanny precision.The pack seemed like a single creature, and each neck a heavy tentacle that ended in a pair of jaws.Her gut twisted at the thought, but there was nothing to barf up.The fishing expedition went on another quarter hour.They got at least seven of the green things.But they weren't eating them; not all of them, anyway.The dismembered leavings collected in a small wood bowl.More gobbling between the two sides.One of the six grabbed the bowl's edge in its mouth and crawled across the mast platform.The four on Johanna's side huddled together as if frightened of the visitor.Only after the bowl was set down and the intruder had returned to its side, did the four in Johanna's hull poke their heads up again.One of the rats picked up the bowl.It and another walked toward her.Johanna swallowed.What torture was this?Her stomach twisted again she was so hungry.She looked at the bowl again and realized that they were trying to feed her.The sun had just come out from under northern clouds.The low light was like some bright fall afternoon, just after rain: dark sky above, yet everything close by bright and glistening.The creatures' fur was deep and plush.One held the bowl towards her, while the other stuck its snout in and withdrew something slick and green.It held the tidbit delicately, just with the tips of its long mouth.It turned and thrust the green thing toward her.Johanna shrank back, "No!"The creature paused.For a moment she thought it was going to echo her.Then it dropped the lump back into the bowl.The first animal set it on the bench beside her.It looked up at her for an instant, then released the jaw wide flange at the edge of the bowl.She had a glimpse of fine, pointy teeth.Johanna stared into the bowl, nausea fighting with hunger.Finally she worked a hand out of her blanket and reached into it.Heads perked up around her, and there was an exchange of gobble comments between the two sides of the boat.Her fingers closed on something soft and cold.She lifted it into the sunlight.The body was gray green, its sides glistening in the light.The guys in the other hull had torn off the little legs and chopped away the head.What remained was only two or three centimeters long.It looked like filleted shellfish.Once she had liked such food.But that had been cooked.She almost dropped the thing when she felt it quiver in her hand.She brought it close to her mouth, touched it with her tongue.Salty.On Straum, most shellfish would make you very sick if you ate them raw.How could she know, all alone without parents or a local commnet?She felt tears coming.She said a bad word, stuffed the green thing into her mouth, and tried to chew.Blandness, with the texture of suet and gristle.She gagged, spat it out and tried to eat another.Altogether she got parts of two down.Maybe that was for the best; she'd wait and see how much she barfed up.She lay back and saw several pairs of eyes watching.The gobbling with the other side of the boat picked up.Then one of them sidled toward her, carrying a leather bag with a spigot.A canteen.This creature was the biggest of all.The leader?It moved its head close to hers, putting the spout of the canteen near her mouth.The big one seemed sly, more cautious about approaching her than the others.Johanna's eyes traveled back along its flanks.Beyond the edge of its jacket, the pelt on its rear was mostly white and scored deep with a Y shaped scar.This is the one that killed Dad.Johanna's attack was not planned; perhaps that's why it worked so well.She lunged past the canteen and swung her free arm around the thing's neck.She rolled over the animal, pinning it against the hull.By itself, it was smaller than she, and not strong enough to push her off.She felt its claws raking through the blankets but somehow never quite cutting her.She put all her weight on the creature's spine, grabbed it where throat met jaw, and began slamming its head against the wood.Then the others were on her, muzzles poking under her, jaws grabbing at her sleeve.She felt rows of needle teeth just poking through the fabric.Their bodies buzzed with a sound from her dreams, a sound that went straight through her clothes and rattled her bones.They pulled her hand from the other's throat, twisting her; she felt the arrowhead tearing her inside.But there was still one thing she could do: Johanna push off with her feet, butting her head against the base of the other's jaw, smashing the top of its head into the hull.The bodies around her convulsed, and she was flipped onto her back.Pain was the only thing she could feel now.Neither rage nor fear could move her.Yet part of her was still aware of the four.She had hurt them.She had hurt them all.Three wandered drunkenly, making whistling sounds that for once seemed to come from their mouths.The one with the scarred butt lay on its side, twitching.She had punched a star shaped wound in the top of its head.Blood dripped down past its eyes.Red tears.Minutes passed and the whistling stopped.The four creatures huddled together and the familiar hissing resumed.The bleeding from her chest had started again.They stared at each other for a while.She smiled at her enemies.They could be hurt.She could hurt them.She felt better than she had since the landing.Before the Flenser Movement, Woodcarvers had been the most famous city state west of the Icefangs.Its founder went back six centuries.In those days, things had been harder in the north; snow covered even the lowlands through most of the year.The Woodcarver had started alone, a single pack in a little cabin on an inland bay.The pack was a hunter and a thinker as much as an artist.There had been no settlements for a hundred miles around.Only a dozen of the carver's early statues ever left his cabin, yet those statues had been his first fame.Three were still in existence.There was a city by the Long Lakes named for the one in its museum.With fame had come apprentices.One cabin became ten, scattered across Woodcarver's fjord.A century or two passed, and of course the Woodcarver slowly changed.He feared the change, the feeling that his soul was slipping away.He tried to keep hold of himself; almost everyone does to one extent or another.In the worst case, the pack falls into perversion, perhaps becomes soul hollow.For Woodcarver, the quest was itself the change.He studied how each member fits within the soul.He studied pups and their raising, and how you might guess the contributions of a new one.He learned to shape the soul by training the members.Of course little of this was new.It was the base of most religions, and every town had romance advisors and brood kenners.Such knowledge, whether valid or not, is important to any culture.What Woodcarver did was to look at it all again, without traditional bias.He gently experimented on himself and on the other artists in his little colony.He watched the results, using them to design new experiments.He was guided by what he saw rather than by what he wanted to believe.By the various standards of his age, what he did was heresy or perversion or simple insanity.In the early years, King Woodcarver was hated almost as much as Flenser was three centuries later.But the far north was still going through its time of heavy winters.The nations of the south could not easily send armies as far as Woodcarvers.Once when they did, they were thoroughly defeated.And wisely, Woodcarver never attempted to subvert the south.Not directly.But his settlement grew and grew, and its fame for art and furniture was small beside its other reputations.Old of heart traveled to the town, and came back not just younger, but smarter and happier.Ideas radiated from the town: weaving machines, gearboxes and windmills, factory postures.Something new had happened in this place.It wasn't the inventions.It was the people that Woodcarver had midwifed, and the outlook he had created.Wickwrackscar and Jaqueramaphan arrived at Woodcarvers late in the afternoon.It had rained most of the day, but now the clouds had blown away and the sky was that bright cloudless blue that was all the more beautiful after a stretch of cloudy days.Woodcarver's Domain was paradise to Peregrine's eyes.He was tired of the packless wilderness.He was tired of worrying about the alien.Twinhulls paced them suspiciously for the last few miles.The boats were armed, and Peregrine and Scriber were coming from very much the wrong direction.But they were all alone, clearly harmless.Long callers hooted, relaying their story ahead.By the time they reached the harbor they were heroes, two packs who had stolen (unspecified) treasure from the villains of the north.They sailed around a breakwater that hadn't existed on Peregrine's last trip, and tied in at the moorage.The pier was crowded with soldiers and wagons.Townspeople were all over the road leading up to the city walls.This was as close to a mob scene as you could get and still have room for sober thought.Scriber bounced out of the boat and pranced about in obvious delight at the cheers from the hillside."Quickly!We must speak with the Woodcarver. "Wickwrackscar picked up the canvas bag that held the alien's picture box, and climbed carefully out of the boat.He was dizzy from the beating the alien had given him.Scar's fore tympanum had been cut in the attack.For a moment he lost track of himself.The pier was very strange  stone at first glance, but walled with a spongy black material he hadn't seen since the Southseas; it should be brittle here Where am I?I should be happy about something, some victory.He paused to regroup.After a moment both the pain and his thoughts sharpened; he would be like this for days yet, at least.Get help for the alien.Get it ashore.King Woodcarver's Lord Chamberlain was a mostly overweight dandy; Peregrine had not expected to see such at Woodcarvers.But the fellow became instantly cooperative when he saw the alien.He brought a doctor down to look at the Two Legs (and incidentally, at Peregrine).The alien had gained strength in the last two days, but there had been no more violence.They got it ashore without much trouble.It stared at Peregrine out of its flat face, a look he knew was impotent rage.He touched Scar's head thoughtfully the Two Legs was just waiting for the best opportunity to do more damage.Minutes later, the travelers were in kherhog drawn carriages, rolling up the cobblestone street toward the city walls.Soldiers cleared the way through the crowd.Scriber Jaqueramaphan waved this way and that, the handsome hero.By now Peregrine knew the shy insecurity that lurked within Scriber.This might be the high point of his whole life till now.Even if he wanted it, Wickwrackscar could not be so expansive.With one of Scar's tympana hurt, wild gestures made him lose track of his thoughts.He hunkered down on the carriage seats and looked out in all directions:  But for the shape of the outer harbor, the place was not at all what he remembered from fifty years ago.In most parts of the world, not much changed in fifty years.A pilgrim returning after such an interval might even be bored by the sameness.But this it was almost scary.The huge breakwater was new.There were twice as many piers, and multiboats with flags he had never seen on this side of the world.The road had been here before, but narrow, with only a third as many turnoffs.Before, the town walls had been more to keep the kherhogs and froghens in than any invaders out.Now they were ten feet high, the black stone extending as far as Peregrine could see And there had been scarcely any soldiers last time; now they were everywhere.That was not a good change.He felt a sinking in the pit of Scar's stomach; soldiers and fighting were not good.They rode through the city gates and past a market maze that spread across acres.The alleys were only fifty feet wide, narrow where bolts of cloth, furniture displays, and crates of fresh fruit encroached.Smells of fruit and spice and varnish hung in the air.The place was so crowded that the haggling was almost an orgy, and dizzy Peregrine almost blacked out.Then they were on a narrower street that zigzagged through ranks of half timbered buildings.Beyond the roofs loomed heavy fortifications.Ten minutes later they were in the castle yard.They dismounted and the Lord Chamberlain had the Two Legs moved to a litter."Woodcarver, he'll see us now?"said Scriber.The bureaucrat laughed."She.Woodcarver changed gender more than ten years ago. "Peregrine's heads twisted about in surprise.Precisely what would that mean?Most packs change with time, but he had never heard of Woodcarver being anything but "he".He almost missed what the Lord Chamberlain said next."Even better.Her whole council must see what you've brought.Come inside. "He waved the guards away.They walked down a hall almost wide enough for two packs to pass abreast.The chamberlain led, followed by the travelers and the doctor with the alien's litter.The walls were high, padded with silver crusted quilting.It was far grander than before and again, unsettling.There was scarcely any statuary, and what there was dated from centuries before.But there were pictures.He stumbled when he saw the first, and behind him he heard Scriber gasp.Peregrine had seen art all around the world: The mobs of the tropics preferred abstract murals, smudges of psychotic color.The Southseas islanders had never invented perspective; in their watercolors, distant objects simply floated in the upper half of the picture.In the Long Lakes Republic, representationism was currently favored, especially multiptychs that gave a whole pack view.But Peregrine had never seen the likes of these.The pictures were mosaics, each tile a ceramic square about a quarter inch on a side.There was no color, just four shades of gray.From a few feet away, the graininess was lost, and they were the most perfect landscapes Peregrine had ever seen.All were views from hilltops around Woodcarvers.Except for the lack of color, they might have been windows.The bottom of each picture was bounded by a rectangular frame, but the tops were irregular; the mosaics simply broke off at the horizon.The hall's quilted wall stood where the pictures should have shown sky."Here now, fellow!I thought you wanted to see Woodcarver. "The remark was directed at Scriber.Jaqueramaphan was strung out along the landscapes, one of him sitting in front of a different picture all down the hall.He turned a head to look at the chamberlain.His voice sounded dazed."Soul's end!It's like being God, as if I have one member on each hilltop and can see everything at once. "But he scrambled to his feet and trotted to catch up.The hall opened on one of the largest indoor meeting rooms Peregrine had ever seen."This is as big as anything in the Republic," Scriber said with apparent admiration, looking up at the three levels of balconies.They stood alone with the alien at the bottom."Hmf. "Besides the chamberlain and the doctor, there were already five other packs in the room.More showed up as they watched.Most were dressed like nobles of the Republic, all jewels and furs.A few wore the plain jackets he remembered from his last trip.Sigh.Woodcarver's little settlement had grown into a city and now a nation state.Peregrine wondered if he  she  had any real power now.He trained one head precisely on Scriber and Hightalked at him."Don't say anything about the picture box just yet. "Jaqueramaphan looked puzzled and conspiratorial all at once.He High Talked back, "Yes yes.A bargaining card?""Something like that. "Peregrine's eyes swept back and forth across the balconies.Most packs entered with an air of harried self importance.He smiled to himself.One glance into the pit was enough to shatter their smugness.The air above him was filled with buzzing talk.None of the packs looked like Woodcarver.But then, she'd have few of her members from before; he could only recognize her by manner and bearing.It shouldn't matter.He had carried some friendships far longer than any member's lifespan.But with others the friend had changed in a decade, its viewpoints altering, affection turning to animosity.He'd been counting on Woodcarver being the same.Now  There was a brief sound of trumpets, almost like a call to order.The pubic doors of a lower balcony slid open and a fivesome entered.Peregrine felt a twitchy thrill of horror.This was Woodcarver, but so misarranged.One member was so old it had to be helped by the rest.Two were scarcely more than puppies, and one of those a constant drooler.The largest member was white eyed blind.It was the sort of thing you might see in a waterfront slum, or in the last generation of incest.She looked down at Peregrine, and smiled almost as if she recognized him.When she spoke, it was with the blind one.The voice was clear and firm."Please carry on, Vendacious. "The chamberlain nodded."As you wish, Your Majesty. "He pointed into the pit, at the alien."That is the reason for this hasty meeting. ""We can see monsters at the circus, Vendacious. "The voice came from an overdressed pack on the top balcony.To judge from the shouting that came from all sides, this was a minority view.One pack on a lower balcony jumped over the railing and tried to shoo the doctor away from the alien's litter.The chamberlain raised a head for silence, and glared down at the fellow who had jumped into the pit."If you please, Scrupilo, be patient.Everyone will get a chance to look. ""Scrupilo" made some grumbling hisses, but backed off."Good. "Vendacious turned all his attention on Peregrine and Scriber."Your boat has outrun any news from the north, my friends.No one but I knows anything of your story  and what I have is guard codes hooted across the bay.You say this creature flew down from the sky?"An invitation to speechify.Peregrine let Scriber Jaqueramaphan do the talking.Scriber loved it.He told the story of the flying house, of the ambush and the murders, and the rescue.He showed them his eye tools and announced himself as a secret agent of the Long Lakes Republic.Now what real spy would do that?Every pack on the council had eyes on the alien, some fearful, some  like Scrupilo  crazily curious.Woodcarver watched with only a couple of heads.The rest might have been asleep.She looked as tired as Peregrine felt.He rested his own heads on his paws.The pain in Scar was a pulsing beat; it would be easy enough to set the member asleep, but then he'd understand very little of what was being said.Hey!maybe that wasn't such a bad idea.Scar drifted off and the pain receded.The talk went on for some minutes more, not making a whole lot of sense to the threesome that was Wickwrack.He understood the tones of voice though.Scrupilo  the pack on the floor  complained several times, impatiently.Vendacious said something, agreeing with him.The doctor retreated, and Scrupilo advanced on Wickwrack's alien.Peregrine pulled himself to full wakefulness."Be careful.The creature is not friendly. "Scrupilo snapped back, "Your friend has already warned me once. "He circled the litter, staring at the alien's brown, furless face.The alien stared back, impassive.Scrupilo reached forward cautiously and drew back the alien's quilt.Still no response."See?"said Scrupilo."It knows I mean no harm. "Peregrine said nothing to correct him."It really walks on those rear paws alone?"said one of the other advisors."Can you imagine it, towering over us?One little bump would knock it down. "Laughter.Peregrine remembered how mantis like the alien had seemed when upright.These fellows hadn't seen it move.Scrupilo wrinkled a nose."The thing is filthy. "He was all around her, a posture that Peregrine knew upset the Two Legs."That arrow shaft must be removed, you know.Most of the bleeding has stopped, but if we expect the creature to live for long, it needs medical attention. "He looked disdainfully at Scriber and Peregrine, as if they were to blame for not performing surgery aboard the twinhull.Something caught his eye and his tone abruptly changed: "By the Pack of Packs!Look at its forepaws. "He loosened the ropes about the creature's front legs."Two paws like that would be as good as five pairs of lips.Think what a pack of these creatures could do!"He moved close to the five tentacled paw."Be  " careful, Peregrine started to say.The alien abruptly bunched its tentacles into a club.Its foreleg flicked out at an impossible angle, ramming its paw into Scrupilo's head.The blow couldn't have been too strong, but it was precisely placed on the tympanum."Ow!Yow!Wow.Wow. "Scrupilo danced back.The alien was shouting, too.It was all mouth noise, thin and low pitched.The eldritch sound brought up every head, even Woodcarver's.Peregrine had heard it many times by now.There was no doubt in his mind  this was the aliens' interpack speech.After a few seconds, the sound changed to a regular hacking that gradually faded.For a long moment no one spoke.Then part of Woodcarver got to her feet.She looked at Scrupilo."Are you all right?"It was the first time she had spoken since the beginning of the meeting.Scrupilo was licking his forehead."Yes.It smarts is all. ""Your curiosity will kill you some day. "The other huffed indignantly, but also seemed flattered by the prediction.Queen Woodcarver looked at her councillors."I see an important question here.Scrupilo thinks one alien member would be as agile as an entire pack of us.Is that so?"She pointed the question at Peregrine rather than Scriber."Yes, Your Majesty.If those ropes had been tied within its reach, it could easily have unknotted them. "He knew where this was going; he'd had three days to get there himself."And the noises it makes sound like coordinated speech to me. "There was a swell of talk as the others caught on.An articulate member can often make semi sensible speech, but usually at the expense of dexterity."Yes A creature like nothing on our world, whose boat flew down from the top of heaven.I wonder at the mind of such a pack, if a single member is almost as smart as all of one of us?"Her blind one looked around as it made the words, almost as if it could see.Two others wiped at her drooler's muzzle.She was not an inspiring sight.Scrupilo poked a head up."I hear not a hint of thought sound from this one.There is no fore tympanum. "He pointed at the torn clothing around the creature's wound."And I see no sign of shoulder tympana.Perhaps it is pack smart even as a singleton and perhaps that's all the aliens ever are. "Peregrine smiled to himself; this Scrupilo was a prickly twit, but not one who held with tradition.For centuries, academics had debated the difference between people and animals.Some animals had larger brains; some had paws or lips more agile than a member's.In the savannahs of Easterlee, there were creatures that even looked like people and ran in groups, but without much depth of thought.Leaving aside wolf nests and whales, only people were packs.It was the coordination of thought between members that made them superior.Scrupilo's theory was a heresy.Jaqueramaphan said, "But we did hear thought sounds, loud ones, during the ambush.Perhaps this one is like our unweaned, unable to think  "  "And yet still almost as smart as a pack," Woodcarver finished somberly."If these people are not smarter than we, then we might learn their devices.No matter how magnificent they are, we could eventually be their equals.But if this member is just one of a superpack" For a moment there was no talk, just the muted underedge of her councillors' thoughts.If the aliens were superpacks, and if their envoy had been murdered  then there might not be anything they could do to save themselves."So.Our first priority should be to save this creature, to befriend it and learn its true nature. "Her heads lowered, and she seemed lost within herself  or perhaps just tired.Abruptly, she turned several heads toward her chamberlain."Move the creature to the lodge by mine. "Vendacious started with surprise."Surely not, Your Majesty!We've seen that it is hostile.And it needs medical attention. "Woodcarver smiled and her voice turned silky.Peregrine remembered that tone from before."Do you forget that I know surgery?Do you forget that I am the Woodcarver?"Vendacious licked his lips and looked at the other advisors.After a second he said, "No, Your Majesty.It will be as you wish. "And Peregrine felt like cheering.Perhaps Woodcarver did still run things.Peregrine was sitting back to back on the steps of his quarters when Woodcarver came to see him next day.She came alone, and wearing the simple green jackets he remembered from his last visit.He didn't bow or go out to meet her.She looked at him coolly for a moment, and sat down just a few yards away."How is the Two Legs?"he asked."I took out the arrow and sewed the wound shut.I think it will survive.My advisors were pleased: the creature didn't act like a reasoning being.It fought even after it was tied down, as though it had no concept of surgery How is your head?""All right, as long as I don't move around. "The rest of him  Scar  lay behind the doorway in the dark interior of the lodge."The tympanum is healing straight, I think.I'll be fine in a few days. ""Good. "A wrecked tympanum could mean continuing mental problems, or the need for a new member and the pain of finding a use for the singleton that was sent into silence."I remember you, pilgrim.All the members are different, but you really are the Peregrine of before.You had some great stories.I enjoyed your visit. ""And I enjoyed meeting the great Woodcarver.That is the reason I returned. "She cocked a head wryly."The great Woodcarver of before, not the wreck of now?"He shrugged."What happened?"She didn't answer immediately.For a moment, they sat and looked across the city.It was cloudy this afternoon, with rain coming.The breeze off the channel was a cool stinging on his lips and eyes.Woodcarver shivered, and puffed her fur out a bit.Finally she said, "I held my soul six hundred years  and that's counting by foreclaws.I should think it's obvious what has become of me. ""The perversion never hurt you before. "Peregrine was not normally so blunt.Something about her brought out the frankness in him."Yes, the average incest degrades to my state in a few centuries, and is an idiot long before then.My methods were much cleverer.I knew who to breed with whom, which puppies to keep and which to put on others.So it was always my flesh bearing my memories, and my soul remained pure.But I didn't understand enough  or perhaps I tried the impossible.The choices got harder and harder, till I was left with choosing between brains and physical defect. "She wiped away the drool, and all but the blind one looked out across her city."These are the best days of summer, you know.Life is a green madness just now, trying to squeeze the last bit of warmth from the season. "And the green did seem to be everywhere it could be: featherleaf down the hillside and in the town, ferns all over the near hillsides, and heather struggling toward the gray crowns of the mountains across the channel."I love this place. "He never expected to be comforting the Woodcarver of Woodcarvers."You made a miracle here.I've heard of it all the way on the other side of the world And I'll bet that half the packs around here are related to you. ""Y yes, I've been successful beyond a rake's wildest dreams.I've had no shortage of lovers, even if I couldn't use the pups myself.Sometimes I think my get has been my greatest experiment.Scrupilo and Vendacious are mostly my offspring but so is Flenser. "Huh!Peregrine hadn't known that last."The last few decades, I'd more or less accepted my fate.I couldn't outwit eternity; sometime soon I would let my soul slip free.I let the council take over more and more; how could I claim the domain after I was no longer me?I went back to art  you saw those monochrome mosaics. ""Yes!They're beautiful. ""I'll show you my picture loom sometime.The procedure is tedious but almost automatic.It was a nice project for the last years of my soul.But now  you and your alien have changed everything.Damn it!If only this had happened a hundred years ago.What I would have done with it!We've been playing with your 'picture box', you know.The pictures are finer than any in our world.They are a bit like my mosaics  the way the sun is like a glowbug.Millions of colored dots go to make each picture, the tiles so small you can't see them without one of Scriber's eye tools.I've worked for years to make a few dozen mosaics.The picture box can make unnumbered thousands, so fast they seem to move.Your aliens make my life less than an unweaned pup's scratching in its cradle. "The queen of the Woodcarvers was softly crying, but her voice was angry."And now the whole world is going to change, but too late for such wreckage as I!"Almost without conscious thought, Peregrine extended one of his members toward the Woodcarver.He walked unseemly close: eight yards, five.Their thoughts were suddenly fuzzy with interference, but he could feel her calming.She laughed blearily."Thank you Strange that you should be sympathetic.The greatest problem of my life is nothing to a pilgrim."You were hurting. "It was all he could think to say."But you pilgrims change and change and change  " She eased one of herself close to him; they were almost touching, and it was even harder to think.Peregrine spoke slowly, concentrating on every word, hoping he wouldn't forget his point."But I do keep something of a soul.The parts that remain a pilgrim must have a certain outlook. "Sometimes great insight comes in the noise of battle or intimacy.This was such at time."And  and I think the world itself is due for a change of soul now that we have Two Legs dropping from the sky.What better time for Woodcarver to give up the old?"She smiled, and the confusion became louder, but a pleasant thing."I   hadn't thought of it that way.Now is the time to change"  Peregrine walked into her midst.The two packs stood for a moment, necking, thoughts blending into sweet chaos.Their last clear recollection was of stumbling up the steps and into his lodge.Late that afternoon, Woodcarver brought the picture box to Scrupilo's laboratory.When she arrived Scrupilo and Vendacious were already present.Scriber Jaqueramaphan was there too, but standing farther from the others than courtesy might demand.She had interrupted some kind of argument.A few days before, such squabbling would have just depressed her.Now  she dragged her limper into the room and looked at the others through her drooler's eyes  and smiled.Woodcarver felt the best she had in years.She had made her decision and acted on it, and now there were new adventures to be had.Scriber brightened at her entrance."Did you check on Peregrine?How is he?""He is fine, fine, just fine. "Oops, no need to show them how fine he really is!"I mean, there'll be a full recovery. ""Your Majesty, I'm very grateful to you and your doctors.Wickwrackscar is a good pack, and I I mean, even a pilgrim can't change members every day, like suits of clothes. "Woodcarver waved an offhand acknowledgment.She walked to the middle of the room, and set the alien's picture box on the table there.It looked like nothing so much as a big pink pillow  with floppy ears and a weird animal design sewed in its cover.After playing with it for a day and a half, she was getting pretty good at opening the thing up.As always, the Two Legs's face appeared, making mouth noises.As always, Woodcarver felt an instant of awe at seeing the moving mosaic.A million colored "tiles" had to flip and shift in absolute synchrony to create the illusion.Yet it happened exactly the same each time.She turned the screen so Scrupilo and Vendacious could see.Jaqueramaphan edged toward the others, and craned a pair of heads to look."You still think the box is an animal?"he said to Vendacious."Perhaps you could feed it sweets and it would tell us its secrets, eh?"Woodcarver smiled to herself.Scriber was no pilgrim; pilgrims depend on goodwill too much to go around giving the needle to the powerful.Vendacious just ignored him.All his eyes were on her."Your Majesty, please do not take offense.I  we of the Council  must ask you again.This picture box is too important to be left in the mouths of a single pack, even one so great as you.Please.Leave it to the rest of us, at least when you sleep. ""No offense taken.If you insist, you may participate in my investigations.Beyond that, I will not go. "She gave him an innocent look.Vendacious was a superb spymaster, a mediocre administrator, and an incompetent scientist.A century ago she would have the likes of him out tending the crops, if he chose to stay at all.A century ago there had been no need for spymasters and one administrator had been enough.How things had changed.She absentmindedly nuzzled the picture box; perhaps things would change again.Scrupilo took Scriber's question seriously."I see three possibilities, sir.First, that it is magic. "Vendacious winced away from him."Indeed, the box may be so far beyond our understanding, that it is magic.But that is the one heresy the Woodcarver has never accepted, and so I courteously omit it. "He flicked a sardonic smile at Woodcarver."Second, that it is an animal.A few on the Council thought so when Scriber first made it talk.But it looks like a stuffed pillow, even down to the amusing figure stitched on its side.More importantly, it responds to stimuli with perfect repeatability.That is something I do recognize.That is the behavior of a machine. ""That's your third possibility?"said Scriber."But to be a machine means to have moving parts, and except for  "  Woodcarver shrugged a tail at them.Scrupilo could go on like this for hours, and she saw that Scriber was the same type."I say, let's learn more and then speculate. "She tapped the corner of the box, just as Scriber had in his original demonstration.The alien's face vanished from the picture, replaced by a dizzying pattern of color.There was a splatter of sound, then nothing but the mid pitch hum the box always made when the top was open.They knew the box could hear low pitched sounds, and it could feel through the square pad on its base.But that pad was itself a kind of picture screen: certain commands transformed the grid of touch spots into entirely new shapes.The first time they did that, the box refused any further commands.Vendacious had been sure they had "killed the little alien".But they had closed the box and reopened it  and it was back to its original behavior.Woodcarver was almost certain that nothing they could do by talking to it or touching it would hurt the thing.Woodcarver retried the known signals in the usual order.The results were spectacular, and identical to before.But change that order in any way and the effects would be different.She wasn't sure if she agreed with Scrupilo: The box behaved with the repeatability of a machine yet the variety of its responses was much more like an animal's.Behind her, Scriber and Scrupilo edged members across the floor.Their heads were stuck high in the air as they strained for a clear look at the screen.The buzz of their thoughts came louder and louder.Woodcarver tried to remember what she'd been planning next.Finally, the noise was just too much."Will you two please back off!I can't hear myself think. "This isn't a choir, you know."Sorry this okay?"They moved back about fifteen feet.Woodcarver nodded.The two members were less than twenty feet from each other.Scrupilo and Scriber must be really eager to see the screen.Vendacious had kept a proper distance, and a look of alert enthusiasm."I have a suggestion," said Scriber.His voice was slurred from the effort of concentrating over Scrupilo's thoughts."When you touch the four/three square and say  " he made the alien sounds; they were all very easy to do " the screen shows a collection of pictures.They seem to match the squares.I think we we are being given choices. "Hm."The box could end up training us. "If this is a machine, we need some new definitions.  "Very well, let's play with it. "Three hours passed.Toward the end, even Vendacious had moved a member nearer the screen; the noise in the room verged on mindless chaos.And everybody had suggestions; "say that", "press this", "last time it said that, we did thus and so".There were intricate colored designs, sprinkled with things that must have been written language.Tiny, two legged figures scampered across the screen, shifting the symbols, opening little windows Scriber Jaqueramaphan's idea was quite right.The first pictures were choices.But some of those led to further pictures of choices.The options spread out  tree like, Scriber said.He wasn't quite right; sometimes they came back to an earlier point; it was a metaphorical network of streets.Four times they ended in cul de sacs, and had to shut the box and begin again.Vendacious was madly drawing maps of the paths.That would help; there were places they would want to see again.But even he realized there were unnumbered other paths, places that blind exploration would never find.And Woodcarver would have given a good part of her soul for the pictures she had already seen.There were starscapes.There were moons that shone blue and green, or banded orange.There were moving pictures of alien cities, of thousands of aliens so close that they were actually touching.If they ran in packs, those packs were bigger than anything in the world, even in the tropics And maybe the question was irrelevant; the cities were beyond anything she ever imagined.Finally Jaqueramaphan backed off.He huddled together.There was a shiver in his voice."T there's a whole universe in there.We could follow it forever, and never know"  She looked at the other two.For once, Vendacious had lost his smugness.There were ink stains on all his lips.The writing benches around him were littered with dozens of sketches, some clearer than others.He dropped the pen, and gasped."I say we take what we have and study it. "He began gathering the sketches, piling them into a neat stack."Tomorrow, after a good sleep, our heads will be clear and  "  Scrupilo dropped back and stretched.His eyes had excited red rims."Fine.But leave the sketches, friend Vendacious. "He jabbed at the drawings."See that one and that?It's clear that our blundering gets us plenty of empty results.Sometimes the picture box just locks us out, but much more often we get that picture: No options, just a couple of aliens dancing in a forest and making rhythm sounds.Then if we say  " and he repeated part of the sequence, " we get that picture of piles of sticks.The first with one, the second with two, and so on. "Woodcarver saw it too."Yes.And a figure comes out and points to each of the piles and says a short noise by each. "She and Scrupilo stared at each other, seeing the same gleam in each others' eyes.The excitement of learning, of finding order where there had seemed only chaos.It had been a hundred years since she last felt this way."Whatever this thing is it's trying to teach us the Two Legs' language. "In the days that followed, Johanna Olsndot had lots of time to think.The pain in her chest and shoulder gradually eased; if she moved carefully, it was only a pulsing soreness.They had taken the arrow out and sewed the wound closed.She had feared the worst when they had tied her down, when she saw the knives in their mouths and the steel on their claws.Then they began cutting; she had not known there could be such pain.She still shuddered with remembered agony.But she didn't have nightmares about it, the way she did about  Mother and Dad were dead; she had seen them die with her own eyes.And Jefri?Jefri might still be alive.Sometimes Johanna could go a whole afternoon full of hope.She had seen the coldsleepers burning on the ground below the ship, but those inside might have survived.Then she would remember the indiscriminate way the attackers had flamed and slashed, killing everything around the ship.She was a prisoner.But for now, the murderers wanted her well.The guards were not armed  beyond their teeth and tines.They kept well away from her when they could.They knew she could hurt them.They kept her inside a big dark cabin.When she was alone she paced the floor.The dogthings were barbarians.The surgery without anesthetics was probably not even intended as torture.She hadn't seen any aircraft, or any sign of electricity.The toilet was a slot carved in a marble slab.The hole went so deep you could scarcely hear the plop hit bottom.But it still smelled bad.These creatures were as backward as people in the darkest ages on Nyjora.They had never had technology, or they had thoroughly forgotten it.Johanna almost smiled.Mom had liked novels about shipwrecks and heroines marooned on lost colonies.The big deal was usually to reinvent technology and repair the spacecraft.Mom was had been so into the history of science; she loved the details of those stories.Well, Johanna was living it now.But with important differences.She wanted rescue, but she also wanted revenge.These creatures were nothing like human.In fact, she couldn't remember reading of anything quite like them.She'd have looked for them in her dataset, except they had taken that.Ha.Let them play with it.They'd quickly run into her booby traps and find themselves totally locked out.At first there were only blankets to keep warm.Then they'd given her clothes cut like her jump suit but made of puffy quilting.They were warm and sturdy, the stitching neater than anything she imagined a nonmachine could do.Now she could comfortably walk around outside.The garden beyond her cabin was the best thing about the place.It was about a hundred meters square, and followed the slope of a hillside.There were lots of flowers, and trees with long, feathery leaves.Flagstoned walks curved back and forth through mossy turf.It was a peaceful place if she let it be, a little like their backyard on Straum.
