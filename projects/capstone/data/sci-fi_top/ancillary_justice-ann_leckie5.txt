There arent any.She raised one eyebrow, and then another, disbelieving.Not on the stations, I amended.You cant get too far down that road with the station AI watching you all the time.On a planet, thats different, its too big for that.Even then, once you get to the point where youre not functioning, youre reeducated and usually sent away somewhere else.So as not to embarrass.For a new start.New surroundings, new assignment.And if you arrived from somewhere very far away to take some job nearly anyone could have filled, everyone knew why that was, though no one would be so gauche as to say it within your hearing.It bothers you, that the Radchaai dont have the freedom to destroy their lives, or other citizens lives.I wouldnt have put it that way.No, of course not.She leaned against the doorframe, folded her arms.For someone who wants a favoran incredibly, unspeakably huge and dangerous favor at thatyoure unexpectedly adversarial.One handed, I gestured.It is as it is.But then, dealing with him makes you angry.She tilted her head in Seivardens general direction.Understandably, I think.The words Im so glad you approve rose to my lips, but I didnt say them.I wanted, after all, an incredibly, unspeakably huge and dangerous favor.All the money in the box, I said, instead.Enough for you to buy land, or rooms on a station, or hell, even a station.A very small one.Her lips quirked in amusement.And you wouldnt have it anymore.Its dangerous even to have seen it, but its worse to actually have it.And you, she pointed out, straightening, dropping her arms, voice now unamused, will bring it directly to the attention of the Lord of the Radch.Who will then be able to trace it back to me.That will always be a danger, I agreed.I would not even pretend that once I fell into Mianaais control she would not be able to extract any information from me she wished, no matter what I wanted to reveal or conceal.But it has been a danger since the moment you laid eyes on it, and will continue to be for as long as you live, whether you give it to me or not.Strigan sighed.Thats true.Unfortunately enough.And truth to tell, I want very badly to go home.Foolish beyond belief.But it wasnt my concern, my concern was getting that gun.I said nothing.Neither did Strigan.Instead, she put on her outer coat and gloves and went out the two doors, and I sat down to eat my breakfast, trying very hard not to guess where she had gone, or whether I had any reason at all to be hopeful.She returned fifteen minutes later with a wide, flat black box.Strigan set the box on the table.It seemed like one solid block, but she lifted off a thick layer of black, revealing more black beneath.Strigan stood, waiting, the lid in her hands, watching me.I reached out and touched a spot on the black, with one finger, gently.Brown spread from where I touched, pooling out into the shape of a gun, now exactly the color of my skin.I lifted my finger and black flooded back.Reached out, lifted off another layer of black, beneath which it finally began to look like a box, with actual things in it, if a disturbingly light suckingly black box, filled with ammunition.Strigan reached out and touched the upper surface of the layer of black I still held.Gray spread from her fingers into a thick strap curled alongside where the gun lay.I wasnt sure what that was.Do you know?Its armor.Officers and human troops used externally worn armor units, instead of the sort that was installed in ones body.Like mine.But a thousand years ago everyones had been implanted.Its never tripped a single alarm, never shown up in any scan Ive been through.That was what I wanted.The ability to walk onto any Radchaai station without alerting anyone to the fact I was armed.The ability to carry a weapon into the very presence of Anaander Mianaai without anyone realizing it.Most Anaanders had no need for armor; being able to shoot through it was just an extra.Strigan asked, How does it do that?How does it hide itself?I dont know.I replaced the layer I was holding, and then the very top.How many of the bastard do you think you can kill?I looked up, away from the box, from the gun, the unlikely goal of nearly twenty years efforts, in front of me, real and solid.In my grasp.I wanted to say, As many as I can reach, before they take me down.But realistically I could only expect to meet one, a single body out of thousands.Then again, realistically I could never have expected to find this gun.That depends, I said.If youre going to make a desperate, hopeless act of defiance you should make it a good one.I gestured my agreement.I plan to ask for an audience.Will you get one?Probably.Any citizen can ask for one, and will almost certainly receive it.I wouldnt be going as a citizen  Strigan scoffed.How are you going to pass as non Radchaai?I will walk onto the docks of a provincial palace with no gloves, or the wrong ones, announce my foreign origin, and speak with an accent.Nothing more will be required.She blinked.Frowned.Not really.I assure you.As a noncitizen my chances of obtaining an audience will depend on my reasons for asking.I hadnt thought that part all the way through yet.It would depend on what I found when I got there.Some things cant be planned too far in advance.And what are you going to do about She waved an ungloved hand toward unconscious Seivarden.I had avoided asking myself that question.Avoided, from the moment I found her, thinking more than one step ahead when it came to what I was going to do about Seivarden.Watch him, she said.He might have reached the point where hes ready to give up the kef for good, but I dont think he has.Why not?He hasnt asked me for help.It was my turn to raise a skeptical eyebrow.If he asked, would you help?Id do what I could.Though of course, hed need to address the problems that led him to use in the first place, if it was going to work long term.Which I dont see any sign of him doing.Privately I agreed, but I didnt say anything.He could have asked for help anytime, Strigan continued.Hes been wandering around for, what, at least five years?Any doctor could have helped him, if hed wanted it.But that would mean admitting he had a problem, wouldnt it?And I dont see that happening anytime soon.It would be best if shif he went back to the Radch.Radch medics could solve all her problems.And would not trouble themselves with whether or not Seivarden had asked for their help, or wanted it in any way.He wont go back to the Radch unless he admits he has a problem.I gestured, not my concern.He can go where he likes.But youre feeding him, and no doubt youll pay his fare up the ribbon, and to whatever system you take ship for next.Hell stay with you as long as its to his advantage, as long as theres food and shelter.And hell steal anything he thinks will get him another hit of kef.Seivarden wasnt as strong as she had once been, or as clear, mentally.Do you think hell find that easy?No, admitted Strigan, but hell be very determined.Yes.Strigan shook her head, as though to clear it.What am I doing?You wont listen to me.Im listening.But she clearly didnt believe me.Its none of my concern, I know.Just She pointed to the black box.Just kill as many of Mianaai as you can.And dont send him after me.Youre leaving?Of course she was, there was no need to answer such a foolish question, and she didnt bother.Instead she went back into her room, saying nothing else, and closed the door.I opened my pack, took out the money and set it on the table, slid the black box into its place.Touched it in the pattern that would make it disappear, nothing but folded shirts, a few packets of dried food.Then I went over to where Seivarden lay, and prodded her with one booted foot.Wake up.She started, sitting suddenly, and flung her back against the nearby bench, breathing hard.Wake up, I said again.Were leaving.12   Except for those hours when communications had been cut off, I had never really lost the sense of being part of Justice of Toren.My kilometers of white walled corridor, my captain, the decade commanders, each decades lieutenants, each ones smallest gesture, each breath, was visible to me.I had never lost the knowledge of my ancillaries, twenty bodied One Amaat, One Toren, One Etrepa, One Bo, and Two Esk, hands and feet for serving those officers, voices to speak to them.My thousands of ancillaries in frozen suspension.Never lost the view of Shisurna itself, all blue and white, old boundaries and divisions erased by distance.From that perspective events in Ors were nothing, invisible, completely insignificant.In the approaching shuttle I felt the distance decrease, felt more forcefully the sensation of being the ship.One Esk became even more what it had always beenone small part of myself.My attention was no longer commanded by things apart from the rest of the ship.Two Esk had taken One Esks place while One Esk was on the planet.Two Esk prepared tea in the Esk decade room for its lieutenantsmy lieutenants.It scrubbed the white walled corridor outside Esks baths, mended uniforms torn on leave.Two of my lieutenants sat over a game board in the decade room, placing counters around, swift and quiet, three others watching.The lieutenants of the Amaat, Toren, Etrepa, and Bo decades, the decade commanders, Hundred Captain Rubran, administrative officers, and medics, talked, slept, bathed, according to their schedules and inclinations.Each decade held twenty lieutenants and its decade commander, but Esk was now my lowest occupied deck.Below Esk, from Var downhalf of my decade deckswas cold and empty, though the holds were still full.The emptiness and silence of those spaces where officers had once lived had disturbed me at first, but I was used to it by now.On the shuttle, in front of One Esk, Lieutenant Awn sat silent, jaw clenched.She was in some respects more physically comfortable than she had ever been in Orsthe temperature, twenty degrees C, was more suitable for her uniform jacket and trousers.And the stink of swamp water had been replaced by the more familiar and more easily tolerable smell of recycled air.But the tiny spaceswhich when she had first come to Justice of Toren had excited pride in her assignment and anticipation of what the future might holdnow seemed to trap and confine her.She was tense and unhappy.Esk Decade Commander Tiaund sat in her tiny office.It held only two chairs and a desk close against one wall, barely more than a shelf, and space for perhaps two more people to stand.Lieutenant Awn has returned, I said to her, and to Hundred Captain Rubran on the command deck.The shuttle docked with a thunk.Captain Rubran frowned.She had been surprised and dismayed at the news of Lieutenant Awns sudden return.The order had come directly from Anaander Mianaai, who was not to be questioned.Along with it had come orders not to ask what had happened.In her office on the Esk deck, Commander Tiaund sighed, closed her eyes, and said, Tea.She sat silent till Two Esk brought her a cup and a flask, poured, and set both at the commanders elbow.Shell see me at her earliest convenience.One Esks attention was mostly on Lieutenant Awn, threading her way through the lift and the narrow white corridors that would take her to the Esk decade, to her own quarters.I read relief when she found those corridors empty except for Two Esk.Commander Tiaund will see you at your earliest convenience, I said to Lieutenant Awn, transmitting directly to her.She acknowledged with a brief twitch of her fingers as she entered the Esk corridors.Two Esk vacated the deck, filing down the corridor to the hold and its waiting suspension pods, and One Esk took up whatever tasks Two Esk had been doing, and also followed Lieutenant Awn.Above, on Medical, a tech medic began to lay out what she needed to replace One Esks missing segment.At the door of her own small quartersthe same that more than a thousand years before had belonged to Lieutenant SeivardenLieutenant Awn turned to say something to the segment that followed her, and then stopped.What?she asked after an instant.Somethings wrong, what is it?Please excuse me, Lieutenant, I said.In the next few minutes the tech medic will connect a new segment.I might be unresponsive for a short while.Unresponsive, she said, feeling momentarily overwhelmed for some reason I couldnt quite understand.And then guilty, and angry.She stood before the unopened door of her quarters, took two breaths, and then turned and went back down the corridor toward the lift.A new segments nervous system has to be more or less functional for the hookup.Theyd tried it in the past with dead bodies, and failed.The same with fully sedated bodiesthe connection was never made properly.Sometimes the new segment is given a tranquilizer, but sometimes the tech medic prefers to thaw the new body out and tie it down quickly, without any sedation at all.This eliminates the chancy step of sedating just the right amount, but it always makes for an uncomfortable hookup.This particular tech medic didnt care much about my comfort.She wasnt obliged to care, of course.Lieutenant Awn entered the lift that would bring her to Medical just as the tech medic triggered the release on the suspension pod that held the body.The lid swung up, and for a hundredth of a second the body lay still and icy within its pool of fluid.The tech medic rolled the body out of the pod onto a neighboring table, the fluid sliding and sheeting off it, and in the same moment it awoke, convulsive, choking and gagging.The preserving medium slides out of throat and lungs easily on its own, but the first few times the experience is a discomfiting one.Lieutenant Awn exited the lift, strode down the corridor toward Medical with One Esk Eighteen close behind her.The tech medic went swiftly to work, and suddenly I was on the table (I was walking behind Lieutenant Awn, I was taking up the mending Two Esk had set down on its way to the holds, I was laying myself down on my small, close bunks, I was wiping a counter in the decade room) and I could see and hear but I had no control of the new body and its terror raised the heart rates of all One Esks segments.The new segments mouth opened and it screamed and in the background it heard laughter.I flailed, the binding came loose and I rolled off the table, fell a meter and a half to the floor with a painful thud.Dont dont dont, I thought at the body, but it wasnt listening.It was sick, it was terrified, it was dying.It pushed itself up and crawled, dizzy, where it didnt care so long as it got away.Then hands under my arms (elsewhere One Esk was motionless) urging me up, and Lieutenant Awn.Help, I croaked, not in Radchaai.Damn medic pulled out a body without a decent voice.Help me.Its all right.Lieutenant Awn shifted her grip, put her arms around the new segment, pulled me in closer.It was shivering, still cold from suspension, and from terror.Its all right.Itll be all right.The segment gasped and sobbed for what seemed forever and I thought maybe it was going to throw up until the connection clicked home and I had control of it.I stopped the sobbing.There, said Lieutenant Awn.Horrified.Sick to her stomach.Much better.I saw that she was newly angry, or perhaps this was another edge of the distress Id seen since the temple.Dont injure my unit, Lieutenant Awn said curtly, and I realized that though she was still looking at me, she was talking to the tech medic.I didnt, Lieutenant, answered the tech medic, with a trace of scorn in her voice.Theyd had this conversation at greater and more acrimonious length, during the annexation.The medic had said, Its not like its human.Its been in the hold a thousand years, its nothing but a part of the ship.Lieutenant Awn had complained to Commander Tiaund, who hadnt understood Lieutenant Awns anger, and said so, but thereafter I hadnt dealt with that particular medic.If youre so squeamish, the medic continued, maybe youre in the wrong place.Lieutenant Awn turned, angry, and left the room without saying anything further.I turned and walked back to the table with some trepidation.The segment was already resisting, and I knew that this tech medic wouldnt care if it hurt when she put in my armor, and the rest of my implants.Things were always a bit clumsy while I got used to a new segmentit would occasionally drop things, or fire off disorienting impulses, random jolts of fear or nausea.Things always seemed off kilter for a bit.But after a week or two it would usually settle down.Most of the time, anyway.Sometimes a segment simply would not function properly, and then it would have to be removed and replaced.They screen the bodies, of course, but its not perfect.The voice wasnt the sort I preferred, and it didnt know any interesting songs.Not ones I didnt already know, anyway.I still cant shake the slight, and definitely irrational, suspicion that the tech medic chose that particular body just to annoy me.After a quick bath, in which I assisted, and a change into a clean uniform, Lieutenant Awn presented herself to Commander Tiaund.Awn.The decade commander waved Lieutenant Awn to the opposite chair.Im glad to have you back, of course.Thank you, sir, said Lieutenant Awn, sitting.I didnt expect to see you so soon.I was sure youd be downside for a while longer.Lieutenant Awn didnt answer.Commander Tiaund waited for five seconds in silence, and then said, I would ask what happened, but Im ordered not to.Lieutenant Awn opened her mouth, took a breath to speak, stopped.Surprised.I had said nothing to her about the orders not to ask what had happened.Corresponding orders to Lieutenant Awn not to tell anyone had not come.A test, I suspected, which I was quite confident Lieutenant Awn would pass.Bad?asked Commander Tiaund.Wanting very much to know more, pushing her luck asking even that much.Yes, sir.Lieutenant Awn looked down at her gloved hands, resting in her lap.Very.Your fault?Everything on my watch is my responsibility, isnt it, sir?Yes, Commander Tiaund acknowledged.But Im having trouble imagining you doing anything improper.The word was weighted in Radchaai, part of a triad of justice, propriety, and benefit.Using it, Commander Tiaund implied more than just that she expected Lieutenant Awn to follow regulations or etiquette.Implied she suspected some injustice was behind events.Though she could certainly not say so plainlyshe possessed none of the facts of the matter and surely did not wish to give anyone the impression she did.And if Lieutenant Awn were to be punished for some breach, she wouldnt want to have publicly taken Lieutenant Awns part no matter what her private opinion.Commander Tiaund sighed, perhaps out of frustrated curiosity.Well, she continued, with feigned cheerfulness.Now youve got plenty of time to catch up on gym time.And youre way behind on renewing your marksmanship certification.Lieutenant Awn forced a humorless smile.There had been no gym in Ors, nor anyplace remotely resembling a firing range.Yes, sir.And Lieutenant, please dont go up to Medical unless you really need to.I could see Lieutenant Awn wanted to protest, to complain.But that, too, would have been a repeat of an earlier conversation.Yes, sir.Dismissed.By the time Lieutenant Awn finally entered her quarters, it was nearly time for suppera formal meal, eaten in the decade room in the company of the other Esk lieutenants.Lieutenant Awn pled exhaustionno lie, as it happened: she had barely slept six hours since shed left Ors nearly three days before.She sat on her bunk, slumped and staring, until I entered, eased off her boots, and took her coat.All right, she said then, closed her eyes and swiveled her legs up onto the bunk.I get the hint.She was asleep five seconds after she laid her head down.The next morning eighteen of my twenty Esk lieutenants stood in the decade room, drinking tea and waiting for breakfast.By custom they couldnt sit without the senior most lieutenant.The Esk decade rooms walls were white, with a blue and yellow border painted just under the ceiling.On one wall, opposite a long counter, were secured various trophies of past annexationsscraps of two flags, red and black and green; a pink clay roof tile with a raised design of leaves molded into it; an ancient sidearm (unloaded) and its elegantly styled holster; a jeweled Ghaonish mask.An entire window from a Valskaayan temple, colored glass arranged to form a picture of a woman holding a broom in one hand, three small animals at her feet.I remembered taking it out of the wall myself and carrying it back here.Every decade room on the ship had a window from that same building.The temples vestments and equipment had been thrown into the street, or found their way to other decade rooms on other ships.It was normal practice to absorb any religion the Radch ran across, to fit its gods into an already blindingly complex genealogy, or to say merely that the supreme, creator deity was Amaat under another name and let the rest sort themselves out.Some quirk of Valskaayan religion made this difficult for them, and the result had been destructive.Among the recent changes in Radch policy, Anaander Mianaai had legalized the practice of Valskaays insistently separate religion, and the governor of Valskaay had given the building back.There had been talk of returning the windows, since we had still at that time been in orbit around Valskaay itself, but ultimately they were replaced with copies.Not long after, the decades below Esk were emptied and closed, but the windows still hung on the walls of the empty, dark decade rooms.Lieutenant Issaaia entered, walked straight to the icon of Toren in its corner niche, and lit the incense waiting in the red bowl at the icons feet.Six officers frowned, and two made a very quiet, surprised murmur.Only Lieutenant Dariet spoke.Is Awn not coming to breakfast?Lieutenant Issaaia turned toward Lieutenant Dariet, showed an expression of surprise that did not, so far as I could tell, mirror her actual feelings, and said, Amaats grace!I completely forgot Awn was back.At the back of the group, safely shielded from Lieutenant Issaaias view, one very junior lieutenant cast a look at another very junior lieutenant.Its been so very quiet, Lieutenant Issaaia continued.Its difficult to believe she is back.Silence and cold ashes, quoted the junior lieutenant who had received the others meaningful glance, more daring than her companion.The poem quoted was an elegy for someone whose funeral offerings had been deliberately neglected.I saw Lieutenant Issaaia react with an instant of ambivalencethe next line spoke of food offerings not made for the dead, and the junior lieutenant conceivably might have been criticizing Lieutenant Awn for not coming to supper the night before, or breakfast on time this morning.It really is One Esk, said another lieutenant, concealing her smirk at the very junior lieutenants cleverness, looking closely at the segments that were at the moment laying out plates of fish and fruit on the counter.Maybe Awn broke it of its bad habits.I hope so.Why so quiet, One?asked Lieutenant Dariet.Oh, dont get it started, groaned another lieutenant.Its too early for all that noise.If it was Awn, good for her, said Lieutenant Issaaia.A little late though.Like now, said a lieutenant at Lieutenant Issaaias elbow.Give me food while yet I live.Another quote, another reference to funeral offerings and a rebuttal in case the junior lieutenant had intended insult in the wrong direction.Is she coming or not?If she isnt coming she should say so.At that moment Lieutenant Awn was in the bath, and I was attending her.I could have told the lieutenants that Lieutenant Awn would be there soon, but I said nothing, only noted the level and temperature of the tea in the black glass bowls various lieutenants held, and continued to lay out breakfast plates.Near my own weapons storage, I cleaned my twenty guns, so I could stow them, along with their ammunition.In each of my lieutenants quarters I stripped the linen from their beds.The officers of Amaat, Toren, Etrepa, and Bo were all well into breakfast, chattering, lively.The captain ate with the decade commanders, a quieter, more sober conversation.One of my shuttles approached me, four Bo lieutenants returning from leave, strapped into their seats, unconscious.They would be unhappy when they woke.Ship, said Lieutenant Dariet, will Lieutenant Awn be joining us for breakfast?Yes, Lieutenant, I said, with One Esk Sixs voice.In the bath I poured water over Lieutenant Awn, who stood, eyes closed, on the grating over the drain.Her breathing was even, but her heart rate was slightly elevated, and she showed other signs of stress.I was fairly sure her tardiness was deliberate, designed to give her the bath to herself.Not because she couldnt handle Lieutenant Issaaiashe certainly could.But because she was still distressed from the past days events.When?asked Lieutenant Issaaia, frowning just slightly.About five minutes, Lieutenant.A chorus of groans went up.Now, Lieutenants, Lieutenant Issaaia admonished.She is our senior.And we should all have patience with her right now.Such a sudden return, when we all thought the Divine would never agree to her leaving Ors.Found out she wasnt such a good choice, eh?sneered the lieutenant at Lieutenant Issaaias elbow.She was close to Lieutenant Issaaia in more than one sense.None of them knew what had happened, and couldnt ask.And I, of course, had said nothing.Not likely, said Lieutenant Dariet, her voice a shade louder than usual.She was angry.Not after five years.I took the tea flask, turned from the counter, went over to where Lieutenant Dariet stood, and poured eleven milliliters of tea into the nearly full bowl she held.You like Lieutenant Awn, of course, said Lieutenant Issaaia.We all do.But she doesnt have breeding.She wasnt born for this.She works so very hard at what comes naturally to us.I would hardly be surprised if five years was all she could take without cracking.She looked at the empty bowl in her gloved hand.I need more tea.You think youd have done a better job, in Awns place, observed Lieutenant Dariet.I dont trouble myself with hypotheticals, answered Lieutenant Issaaia.The facts are what they are.Theres a reason Awn was senior Esk lieutenant long before any of us got here.Obviously Awn has some ability or shed never have done as well as she has, but shes reached her limit.A quiet murmur of agreement.Her parents are cooks, Lieutenant Issaaia continued.Im sure theyre excellent at what they do.Im sure she would manage a kitchen admirably.Three lieutenants snickered.Lieutenant Dariet said, her voice tight and edged, Really?Finally dressed, uniform as perfect as I could make it, Lieutenant Awn stepped out of the dressing room, into the corridor, five steps away from the decade room.Lieutenant Issaaia noticed Lieutenant Dariets mood with a familiar ambivalence.Lieutenant Issaaia was senior, but Lieutenant Dariets house was older, wealthier than Lieutenant Issaaias, and Lieutenant Dariets branch of that house were direct clients to a prominent branch of Mianaai itself.Theoretically that didnt matter here.Theoretically.All the data I had received from Lieutenant Issaaia that morning had had an underlying taste of resentment, which grew momentarily stronger.Managing a kitchen is a perfectly respectable job, said Lieutenant Issaaia.But I can only imagine how difficult it must be, to be bred to be a servant and instead of taking an assignment that truly suits, to be thrust into a position of such authority.Not everyone is cut out to be an officer.The door opened, and Lieutenant Awn stepped in just as the last sentence left Lieutenant Issaaias mouth.Silence engulfed the decade room.Lieutenant Issaaia looked calm and unconcerned, but felt abashed.She had clearly not intendedwould never have daredto say such things openly to Lieutenant Awn.Only Lieutenant Dariet spoke.Good morning, Lieutenant.Lieutenant Awn didnt answer, didnt even look at her, but went to the corner of the room where the decade shrine sat, with its small figure of Toren and bowl of burning incense.Lieutenant Awn made her obeisance to the figure and then looked at the bowl with a slight frown.As before, her muscles were tense, her heart rate elevated, and I knew she guessed at the content or at least the drift of the conversation before she had entered, knew who it was who wasnt cut out to be an officer.She turned.Good morning, Lieutenants.I apologize for having kept you waiting.And launched without any other preamble into the morning prayer.The flower of justice is peace The others joined, and when they were finished Lieutenant Awn went to her place at the head of the table, sat.Before the others had time to settle themselves, I had tea and breakfast in front of her.I served the others, and Lieutenant Awn took a sip of her tea and began to eat.Lieutenant Dariet picked up her utensil.Its good to have you back.Her voice was just slightly edged, only barely managing to conceal her anger.Thank you, said Lieutenant Awn, and took another bite of fish.I still need tea, said Lieutenant Issaaia.The rest of the table was tense and hushed, watching.The quiet is nice, but perhaps theres been a decline in efficiency.Lieutenant Awn chewed, swallowed, took another drink of tea.Pardon?Youve managed to silence One Esk, explained Lieutenant Issaaia, but She raised her empty bowl.At that moment I was behind her with the flask, and poured, filling the bowl.Lieutenant Awn raised one gloved hand, gesturing toward the mootness of Lieutenant Issaaias point.I havent silenced One Esk.She looked at the segment with the flask and frowned.Not intentionally, anyway.Go ahead and sing if you want, One Esk.A dozen lieutenants groaned.Lieutenant Issaaia smiled insincerely.Lieutenant Dariet stopped, a bite of fish halfway to her mouth.I like the singing.Its nice.And its a distinction.Its embarrassing is what it is, said the lieutenant close to Lieutenant Issaaia.I dont find it embarrassing, said Lieutenant Awn, a bit stiffly.Of course not, said Lieutenant Issaaia, malice concealed in the ambiguity of her words.Why so quiet, then, One?Ive been busy, Lieutenant, I answered.And I havent wanted to disturb Lieutenant Awn.Your singing doesnt disturb me, One, said Lieutenant Awn.Im sorry you thought it did.Please, sing if you want.Lieutenant Issaaia raised an eyebrow.An apology?And a please?Thats a bit much.Courtesy, said Lieutenant Dariet, her voice uncharacteristically prim, is always proper, and always beneficial.Lieutenant Issaaia smirked.Thank you, Mother.Lieutenant Awn said nothing.Four and a half hours after breakfast, the shuttle bearing those four Second Bo lieutenants home from their leave docked.Theyd been drinking for three days, and had continued right up to the moment they left Shisurna Station.The first of them through the lock staggered slightly, and then closed her eyes.Medic, she breathed.They expect you, I said through the segment of One Bo Id placed there.Do you need help onto the lift?The lieutenant made a feeble attempt to wave my offer away, and moved off slowly down the corridor, one shoulder against the wall for support.I boarded the shuttle, kicking off past the boundary of my artificially generated gravitythe shuttle was too small to have its own.Two of the officers, still drunk themselves, were trying to wake the fourth, passed out cold in her seat.The pilotthe most junior of the Bo officerssat stiff and apprehensive.I thought at first her discomfort was due to the reek of spilled arrack and vomitthankfully the former had apparently been spilled onto the lieutenants themselves, on Shisurna Station, and nearly all of the latter had gone into the appropriate receptaclesbut then I looked (One Bo looked) toward the stern and saw three Anaander Mianaais sitting silent and impassive in the rear seats.Not there, to me.She would have boarded at Shisurna Station, quietly.Told the pilot to say nothing to me.The others had, I suspected, been too intoxicated to notice her.I thought of her asking me, on the planet, when she had last visited me.Of my inexplicable and reflexive lie.The real last time had been a good deal like this.My lord, I said when all the Bo lieutenants were out of earshot.Ill notify the hundred captain.No, said one Anaander.Your Var deck is empty.Yes, my lord, I acknowledged.Ill stay there while Im on board.Nothing further, no why or how long.Or when I could tell the captain what I was doing.I was obliged to obey Anaander Mianaai, even over my own captain, but I rarely had an order from one without the knowledge of the other.It was uncomfortable.I sent segments of One Esk to retrieve One Var from the hold, started one section of Var deck warming.The three Anaander Mianaais declined my offer of assistance with their luggage, carried their things down to Var.This had happened before, at Valskaay.My lower decks had been mostly empty, because many of my troops had been out of the hold and working.She had stayed on the Esk deck that time.What had she wanted then, what had she done?To my dismay I found my thoughts slipping around the answer, which remained vague, invisible.That wasnt right.It wasnt right at all.Between the Esk and Var decks was direct access to my brain.What had she done, at Valskaay, that I couldnt remember, and what was she preparing to do now?13   Further south the snow and ice became impermanent, though it was still cold by non Nilt standards.Nilters regard the equatorial region as a sort of tropical paradise, where grain can actually grow, where the temperature can easily exceed eight or nine degrees C.  Most of Nilts large cities are on or near the equatorial ring.The same is true of the planets one claim to any sort of famethe glass bridges.These are approximately five meter wide ribbons of black hanging in gentle catenaries across trenches nearly as wide as they are deepdimensions measured in kilometers.No cables, no piers, no trusses.Just the arc of black attached to each cliff face.Fantastic arrangements of colored glass coils and rods hang from the bottoms of the bridges, sometimes projecting sideways.The bridges themselves are, according to all observations, also made of glass, though glass could never possibly withstand the sort of stress these bridges doeven their own weight should be too much for them, suspended as they are with nothing for support.There are no rails or handholds, just the drop, and at the bottom, kilometers down, a cluster of thick walled tubes, each one just a meter and a half wide, empty and smooth walled.These are made of the same material as the bridges.No one knows what the bridges and the tubes beneath them were for, or who built them.They were here when humans first colonized Nilt.Theories abound, each one less likely than the one before.Inter dimensional beings feature prominently in many of themthese either created or shaped humanity for its own purposes, or left a message for humans to decipher for obscure reasons of their own.Or they were evil, bent on destruction of all life.The bridges were, somehow, part of their plan.Another whole subfield claims the bridges were built by humanssome ancient, long lost, fantastically advanced civilization that either died out (slowly, pathetically; or spectacularly as the result of some catastrophic mistake) or moved on to a higher level of existence.Advocates of this sort of theory often make the additional claim that Nilt is, in reality, the birthplace of humans.Nearly everywhere Ive been, popular wisdom has it that the location of humanitys original planet is unknown, mysterious.In fact it isnt, as anyone who troubles to read on the subject will discover, but it is very, very, very far away from nearly anywhere, and not a tremendously interesting place.Or at the very least, not nearly as interesting as the enchanting idea that your people are not newcomers to their homes but in fact only recolonized the place they had belonged from the beginning of time.One meets this claim anywhere one finds a remotely human habitable planet.The bridge outside Therrod wasnt much of a tourist attraction.Most of the jewel bright arabesques of glass had shattered over thousands of years, leaving it nearly plain.And Therrod is still too far north for non Nilters to endure comfortably.Offworld visitors generally confine themselves to the better preserved bridges on the equator, buy a bov hair blanket guaranteed hand spun and handwoven by masters of the craft in the unbearably cold reaches of the world (though these are almost certainly turned out on machines, by the dozen, a few kilometers from the gift shop), choke down a few fetid swallows of fermented milk, and return home to regale their friends and associates with tales of their adventure.All this I learned within a few minutes of knowing I would need to visit Nilt to achieve my aim.Therrod sat on a broad river, chunks of green and white ice bobbing and crashing in its current, the first boats of the season already moored at the docks.On the opposite side of the city, the dark slash of the bridges huge trough made a definitive stop to the straggling edge of houses.The southern edge of the city was flier parks, then a wide complex of blue and yellow painted buildings that was, by the look of it, a medical facility, one that must have been the largest of its kind in the area.It was surrounded by squares of lodgings and food shops, and swaths of houses, bright pink, orange, yellow, red, in stripes and zigzags and crosshatches.We had flown half the day.I might have flown all night, I was capable of it, though it would have been unpleasant.But I saw no need for haste.I set down in the first empty space I found, told Seivarden curtly to get out, and did so myself.I shouldered my pack, paid the parking fee, disabled the flier as I had at Strigans, and set off toward the city, not looking to see if Seivarden followed.I had set down near the medical facility.The lodgings surrounding it were some of them luxurious, but many were smaller and less comfortable than the one Id rented in the village where Id found Seivarden, though a bit more expensive.Bright coated southerners came and went, speaking a language I didnt understand.Others spoke the one I knew, and fortunately this was the same language the signs used.I chose lodgingroomier, at least, than the suspension pod size holes that were the cheapest availableand took Seivarden off to the first clean looking and moderately priced food shop I could find.When we entered, Seivarden eyed the shelves of bottles on the far wall.They have arrack.Itll be incredibly expensive, I said, and probably not very good.They dont make it here.Have a beer instead.She had been showing some signs of stress, and wincing slightly at the profusion of bright colors, so I expected some sort of irritable outburst, but instead she merely gestured acquiescence.Then she wrinkled her nose, slight disgust.What do they make beer out of here?Grain.It grows nearer the equator.Its not as cold there.We found seats on the benches that lined three rows of long tables, and a waiter brought us beer, and bowls of something she told us was the house specialty, Extra beautiful eating, yes, she said, in a badly mangled approximation of Radchaai, and it was in fact quite good, and turned out to have actual vegetables in it, a good proportion of thinly sliced cabbage among whatever the rest of it was.The smaller lumps appeared to be meatprobably bov.Seivarden cut one of the larger lumps in two with her spoon, revealing plain white.Probably cheese, I said.She grimaced.Why cant these people eat real food?Dont they know better?Cheese is real food.So is cabbage.But this sauce  Tastes good.I took another spoonful.This whole place smells funny, she complained.Just eat.She looked dubiously at her bowl, scooped a spoonful, sniffed it.It cant possibly smell worse than that fermented milk drink, I said.She actually half smiled.No.I took another spoonful, pondering the implications of this better behavior.I wasnt sure what it meant, about her state of mind, about her intentions, about who or what she thought I was.Maybe Strigan had been right, and Seivarden had decided the most profitable course, for now, was to not alienate the person who was feeding her, and that would change as soon as her options changed.A high voice called out from another table.Hello!I turnedthe girl with the Tiktik set waved to me from where she sat with her mother.For an instant I was surprised, but we were near the medical center, where I knew they had brought their injured relative, and they had come from the same direction we had, and so they had likely parked on the same side of town.I smiled and nodded, and she got up and came to where we were sitting.Your friend is better!she said, brightly.Thats good.What are you eating?I dont know, I admitted.The waiter said it was the house specialty.Oh, thats very good, I had it yesterday.When did you get here?Its so hot its like summer already, I cant imagine what its like further north.Clearly shed had time to recover her more usual spirits since the accident that had brought her to Strigans house.Seivarden, spoon in hand, watched her, bemused.Weve been here an hour, I said.Were only stopping for the night, on our way to the ribbon.Were here until Uncles legs are better.Which will probably be another week.She frowned, counting days.A little longer.Were sleeping in our flier, which is terribly uncomfortable, but Mama says the price for lodging here is outright theft.She sat down on the end of the bench, next to me.Ive never been in space, whats it like?Its very coldeven you would find it cold.She thought that was funny, gave a little laugh.And of course theres no air and hardly any gravity so everything just floats.She frowned at me, mock rebuke.You know what I mean.I glanced over to where her mother sat, stolid, eating.Unconcerned.Its really not very exciting.The girl made a gesture of indifference.Oh!You like music.Theres a singer at a place down the street tonight.She used the word I had used mistakenly, not the one she had corrected me with, in Strigans house.We didnt go to hear her last night because they charge.And besides shes my cousin.Or shes in the next lineage over from mine, and shes my mothers cousins daughters aunt, thats close enough anyway.I heard her at the last ingather, shes very good.Ill be sure to go.Where is it?She gave me the name of the place, and then said she had to finish her supper.I watched her go back to her mother, who only looked up, briefly, and gave a curt nod, which I returned.The place the girl had named was only a few doors down, a long, low ceilinged building, its back wall all shutters, open just now on a walled yard, where Nilters sat uncoated in the one degree air, drinking beer, listening silently to a woman playing a bowed, stringed instrument Id never seen before.I quietly ordered beer for myself and Seivarden, and we took seats on the inner side of the shuttersslightly warmer than the yard for the lack of a breeze, and with a wall to put our backs against.A few people turned to look at us, stared a moment, then turned away more or less politely.Seivarden leaned three centimeters in my direction and whispered, Why are we here?To hear the music.She raised an eyebrow.This is music?I turned to look at her directly.She flinched, just slightly.Sorry.Its just She gestured helplessly.Radchaai do have stringed instruments, quite a variety of them, in fact, accrued through several annexations, but playing them in public is considered a slightly risqu act, because one has to play either bare handed, or in gloves so thin as to be nearly pointless.And this musicthe long, slow, uneven phrases that made its rhythms difficult for the Radchaai ear to hear, the harsh, edged tone of the instrumentwas not what Seivarden had been brought up to appreciate.Its so  A woman at a nearby table turned and made a reproving, shushing noise.I gestured conciliation, and turned a cautioning look on Seivarden.For a moment her anger showed in her face and I was sure I would have to take her outside, but she took a breath, and looked at her beer, and drank, and afterward looked steadily ahead in silence.The piece ended, and the audience rapped fists gently on their tables.The string player somehow looked both impassive and gratified, and launched into another, this one noticeably faster and loud enough for Seivarden to safely whisper to me again.How long are we going to be here?A while, I said.Im tired.I want to go back to the room.Do you know where it is?She gestured assent.The woman at the other table eyed us disapprovingly.Go, I whispered, as quietly as I could and still, I hoped, be heard by Seivarden.Seivarden left.Not my concern anymore, I told myself, whether she found her way back to our lodgings (and I congratulated myself on having had the foresight to lock my pack in the facilitys safe for the nighteven without Strigans warning I didnt trust Seivarden with my belongings or my money) or wandered aimlessly through the city, or walked into the river and drownedwhatever she did, it was no concern of mine and nothing I needed to worry about.I had, instead, a jar of sufficiently decent beer and an evening of music, with the promise of a good singer, and songs Id never heard before.I was nearer to my goal than Id ever dared hope to be, and I could, for just this one night, relax.The singer was excellent, though I didnt understand any of the words she sang.She came on late, and by then the place was crowded and noisy, though the audience occasionally fell silent over their beer, listening to the music, and the knocking between pieces grew loud and boisterous.I ordered enough beer to justify my continued presence, but did not drink most of it.Im not human, but my body is, and too much would have dulled my reactions unacceptably.I stayed quite late, and then walked back to our lodgings along the darkened street, here and there a pair or threesome walking, conversing, ignoring me.In the tiny room I found Seivarden asleepmotionless, breathing calm, face and limbs slack.Something indefinably still about her suggested that this was the first Id seen her in real, restful sleep.For the briefest instant I found myself wondering if shed taken kef, but I knew she had no money, didnt know anyone here, and didnt speak any of the languages I had heard so far.I lay down beside her and slept.I woke six hours later, and incredibly, Seivarden still lay beside me, still asleep.I didnt think she had waked while I slept.She might as well get as much rest as she could.I was, after all, in no hurry.I rose and went out.Further toward the medical center the street became noisy and crowded.I bought a bowl of hot, milky porridge from a vendor along the side of the walkway, and continued along where the road curved around the hospital and off toward the center of the town.Buses stopped, let passengers off, picked others up, continued on.In the stream of people, I saw someone I recognized.The girl from Strigans, and her mother.They saw me.The girls eyes widened, and she frowned slightly.Her mothers expression didnt change, but they both swerved to approach me.They had, it seemed, been watching for me.Breq, said the girl, when they had stopped in front of me.Subdued.Uncharacteristically, it seemed.Is your uncle all right?I asked.Yes, Uncle is fine.But clearly something troubled her.Your friend, said her mother, impassive as always.And stopped.Yes?Our flier is parked near yours, the girl said, clearly dreading the communication of bad news.We saw it when we got back from supper last night.Tell me.I didnt enjoy suspense.Her mother actually frowned.Its not there now.I said nothing, waiting for the rest.You must have disabled it, she continued.Your friend took money, and the people who paid him towed the flier away.The lot staff must not have questioned it, they had seen Seivarden with me.She doesnt speak any languages, I protested.They made lots of motions!explained the girl, gesturing widely.Lots of pointing and speaking very slow.I had badly underestimated Seivarden.Of courseshe had survived, going from place to place with no language but Radchaai, and likely no money, but still had managed to nearly overdose on kef.More than once, likely.She could manage herself, even if she managed badly.She was entirely capable of getting what she wanted without help.And she had wanted kef, and she had obtained it.At my expense, but that was of no importance to her.We knew it couldnt be right, said the girl, because you said you were only stopping the night on the way to space, but no one would have listened to us, were just bov herders.And no doubt the sort of person who would buy a flier with no documentation, no proof of ownershipa flier, moreover, that had obviously been deliberately disabled to prevent its being moved by anyone but the ownerit might very well be a good idea to avoid confronting such a person.I would not presume to say, said the girls mother, oblique condemnation, what sort of friend your friend is.Not my friend.Never my friend, now or at any other time.Thank you for telling me.I walked to the lot, and the flier was indeed gone.When I returned to the room, I found Seivarden still sleeping, or at any rate still unconscious.I wondered just how much kef the flier had bought her.I only wondered long enough to retrieve my pack from the lodgings safe, pay for the nightafter this Seivarden would have to fend for herself, which apparently posed very little problem for herand went looking for transport out of town.There was a bus, but the first had left fifteen minutes before I asked after it, and the next would not leave for three hours.A train ran alongside the river, northward once a day, and like the bus it had already left.I didnt want to wait.I wanted to be gone from here.More specifically, I didnt want to chance seeing Seivarden again, even briefly.The temperature here was mostly above freezing and I was entirely capable of walking long distances.The next town worth the name was, according to maps Id seen, only a day away, if I cut across the glass bridge and then straight across the countryside instead of following the road, which curved to avoid the river and the bridges wide chasm.The bridge was several kilometers out of town.The walk would do me good; I had not had enough exercise lately.The bridge itself might be mildly interesting.I set off toward it.When I had walked a little over half a kilometer, past the lodgings and food shops that surrounded the medical center, into what looked like a residential neighborhoodsmaller buildings, groceries, clothes shops, complexes of low, square houses joined by covered passagewaysSeivarden came up behind me.Breq!she gasped, out of breath.Where are you going?I didnt answer, only walked faster.Breq, damn it!I stopped, but did not turn around.Considered speaking.Nothing I thought of saying was remotely temperate, nor would anything I said do any sort of good.Seivarden caught up with me.Why didnt you wake me up?she asked.Answers occurred to me.I refrained from speaking any of them aloud, and instead began walking again.I didnt look back.I didnt care if she followed me or not, hoped, in fact, she wouldnt.I could certainly have no continued sense of responsibility, no fears that without me she would be helpless.She could take care of herself.Breq, damn it!Seivarden called again.And then swore, and I heard her footsteps behind me, and her labored breath again as she caught up.This time I didnt stop, but quickened my pace slightly.After another five kilometers, during which she had intermittently fallen behind and then raced, gasping, to catch up, she said, Aatrs tits, you hold a grudge, dont you.Still I said nothing, and didnt stop.Another hour passed, the town well behind us, and the bridge came in sight, flat black arcing across the drop, spikes and curls of glass below, brilliant red, intense yellow, ultramarine, and jagged stubs of others.The chasm walls were striated, black, green gray, and blue, frosted here and there with ice.Below, the bottom of the chasm was lost in cloud.A sign in five languages proclaimed it to be a protected monument, access permitted only to a certain class of license holderswhat license, to what purpose, was mysterious to me, as I did not recognize all the words on the sign.A low barrier blocked the entrance, nothing I could not easily step over, and there was no one here but me and Seivarden.The bridge itself was five meters wide, like all the others, and while the wind blew strong, it wasnt strong enough to endanger me.I strode forward and stepped over the barrier and out onto the bridge.Had heights troubled me, I might have found it dizzying.Fortunately they did not, and my only discomfort was the feeling of open spaces behind and under me that I could not see unless I turned my attention away from other places.My boots thunked on the black glass, and the whole structure swayed slightly, and shuddered in the wind.A new pattern of vibrations told me Seivarden had followed me.What happened next was largely my own fault.We were halfway across when Seivarden spoke.All right, all right.I get it.Youre angry.I stopped, but did not turn.How much did it get you?I asked, finally, only one of the things I had considered saying.What?Though I hadnt turned, I could see the motion as she leaned over, hands on her knees, could hear her still breathing hard, straining to be heard against the wind.How much kef?I only wanted a little, she said, not quite answering my question.Enough to take the edge off.I need it.And its not like you paid for that flier to begin with.For an instant I thought she had remembered how I had acquired the flier, unlikely as that seemed.But she continued, Youve got enough in that pack to buy ten fliers, and none of its yours, it belongs to the Lord of the Radch, doesnt it?Making me walk like this is just you being pissy.I stood, still facing forward, my coat flattened against me in the wind.Stood trying to understand what her words meant, about who or what she thought I was.Why she thought I had troubled myself about her.I know what you are, she said, as I stood silent.No doubt you wish you could leave me behind, but you cant, can you?Youve got orders to bring me back.What am I?I asked, still without turning.Loud, against the wind.Nobody, thats who.Seivardens voice was scornful.She was standing upright now, just behind my left shoulder.You tested into military, in the aptitudes, and like a million other nobodies these days, you think that makes you somebody.And you practiced the accent and how to hold your utensils, and knelt your way to Special Missions and now Im your special mission, youve got to bring me home in one piece even though youd rather not, wouldnt you?Youve got a problem with me, at a guess your problem is that try all you like, whoever you kneel to, youll never be what I was born to be, and people like you hate that.I turned toward her.Im certain my face was without expression, but when my eyes met hers she flinchedno edge taken off, none at alland took three quick, reflexive steps backward.Over the edge of the bridge.I stepped to the edge, looked down.Seivarden hung six meters below, hands clenched around a complicated swirl of red glass, her eyes wide, mouth open slightly.She looked up at me and said, You were going to hit me!The calculations came easily to me.All my clothes knotted would only reach 5.7 meters.The red glass was connected somewhere under the bridge I couldnt see, no sign of anything she could climb.The colored glass wasnt as strong as the bridge itselfI guessed the red spiral would shatter under Seivardens weight sometime in the next three to seven seconds.Though that was only a guess.Still, any help I might call would certainly arrive too late.Clouds still veiled the bottom reaches of the chasm.Those tubes were just a few centimeters narrower than my outstretched arms, and were themselves very deep.Breq?Seivardens voice was breathy and strained.Can you do something?Not, at least, You have to do something.Do you trust me?I asked.Her eyes widened further, her gasps became a bit more ragged.She didnt trust me, I knew.She was only still with me because she thought I was official, hence inescapable, and she was important enough for the Radch to send someone after herunderestimating her own importance was never one of Seivardens failingsand perhaps because she was tired of running, from the world, from herself.Ready to give up.But I still didnt understand why I was with her.Of all the officers Ive served with, she was never one of my favorites.I trust you, she lied.When I grab you, raise your armor and put your arms around me.Fresh alarm flashed across her face, but there was no more time.I extended my armor under my clothes and stepped off the bridge.The instant my hands touched her shoulders, the red glass shattered, sharp edged fragments flying out and away, glittering briefly.Seivarden closed her eyes, ducked her head, face into my neck, held me tight enough that if I hadnt been armored my breathing would have been impeded.Because of the armor I couldnt feel her panicked breath on my skin, couldnt feel the air rushing past, though I could hear it.But she didnt extend her own armor.If I had been more than just myself, if I had had the numbers I needed, I could have calculated our terminal velocity, and just how long it would take to reach it.Gravity was easy, but the drag of my pack and our heavy coats, whipping up around us, affecting our speed, was beyond me.It would have been much easier to calculate in a vacuum, but we werent falling in a vacuum.But the difference between fifty meters a second and 150 was, at that moment, only large in the abstract.I couldnt see the bottom yet, the target I was hoping to hit was small, and I didnt know how much time wed have to adjust our attitude, if we even could.For the next twenty to forty seconds we had nothing to do but wait, and fall.Armor!I shouted into Seivardens ear.Sold it, she answered.Her voice shook slightly, straining against the rushing air.Her face was still pressed hard against my neck.Suddenly gray.Moisture formed on exposed portions of my armor and blew streaming upward.One point three five seconds later I saw the ground, dark circles packed tight.Bigger, and therefore closer, than I liked.A surge of adrenaline surprised me; I must have gotten too used to falling.I turned my head, trying to look straight down past Seivardens shoulder to what lay directly below us.My armor was made to spread out the force of a bullets impact, bleed some of it away as heat.It was theoretically impenetrable, but I could still be injured or even killed with the application of sufficient force.Id suffered broken bones, lost bodies under an unrelenting hail of bullets.I wasnt sure what the friction of decelerating would do to my armor, or to me; I had some skeletal and muscular augmentation, but whether it would be sufficient for this, I had no idea.I was unable to calculate just exactly how fast we were going, just exactly how much energy needed to be bled away to slow to a survivable speed, how hot it would get inside and outside my armor.And unarmored, Seivarden wouldnt be able to assist.Of course, if I had still been what I once was, it wouldnt matter.This wouldnt have been my only body.I couldnt help thinking I should have let Seivarden fall.Shouldnt have jumped.Falling, I still didnt know why I had done it.But at the moment of choice I had found I couldnt walk away.By then I knew our distance in centimeters.Five seconds, I said, shouted, above the wind.By then it was four.If we were very, very lucky wed fall straight into the tube below us and Id push my hands and feet against the walls.If we were very, very lucky the heat from the friction wouldnt burn unarmored Seivarden too badly.If I was even luckier Id only break my wrists and ankles.All of it struck me as unlikely, but the omens would fall as Amaat intended.Falling didnt bother me.I could fall forever and not be hurt.Its stopping thats the problem.Three seconds, I said.Breq, Seivarden said, a gasping sob.Please.Some answers I would never have.I abandoned what calculations I was still making.I didnt know why I had jumped but at that moment it no longer mattered, at that moment there was nothing else.Whatever you doone seconddont let go.Darkness.No impact.I thrust out my arms, which were immediately forced upward, wrists and one ankle breaking on impact despite my armors reinforcement, tendons and muscles tearing, and we began a tumble sideways.Despite the pain I pulled my arms and legs in and reached and kicked out again, quickly, steadying us the instant after.Something in my right leg broke as I did, but I couldnt afford to worry about it.Centimeter by centimeter we slowed.I could no longer control my hands or feet, could only push against the walls and hope we wouldnt be pushed off balance again, and fall helpless, headfirst, to our deaths.The pain was sharp, blinding, blocking out everything except numbersa distance (estimated) decreasing by centimeters (also estimated); speed (estimated) decreasing; external armor temperature (increasing at my extremities, possible danger of exceeding acceptable parameters, possible resulting injury), but the numbers were near meaningless to me, the pain was louder, more immediate, than anything else.But the numbers were important.A comparison of distance and our rate of deceleration suggested disaster ahead.I tried to take a deep breath, found I was incapable of it, and tried to push harder against the walls.I have no memory of the rest of the descent.I woke, on my back, in pain.My hands and arms, my shoulders.Feet and legs.In front of medirectly abovea circle of gray light.Seivarden, I tried to say, but it came out as a convulsive sigh that echoed just slightly against the walls.Seivarden.The name came out this time, but barely audible, and distorted by my armor.I dropped the armor and tried speaking again, managing this time to engage my voice.Seivarden.I raised my head, just slightly.In the dim light from above I saw that I lay on the ground, knees bent and turned to one side, the right leg at a disturbing angle, my arms straight beside my body.I tried to move a finger, failed.A hand.Failedof course.I tried shifting my right leg, which responded with more pain.There was no one here but me.Nothing here but meI didnt see my pack.At one time, if there had been a Radchaai ship in orbit, I could have contacted it, easy as thought.But if I had been anywhere a Radchaai ship was likely to be, this would never have happened.If I had left Seivarden in the snow, this would never have happened.I had been so close.After twenty years of planning and working, of maneuvering, two steps forward here, a step backward there, slowly, patiently, against all likelihood I had gotten this far.So many times I had made a throw like this, not only my success at hazard, but my life, and each time I had won, or at least not lost in any way that prevented me from trying again.Until now.And for such a stupid reason.Above me clouds hid the unreachable sky, the future I no longer had, the goal I was now incapable of accomplishing.Failed.I closed my eyes against tears not brought on by physical pain.If I failed, it would not be because I had ever, at any time, given up.Seivarden had left somehow.I would find her.I would rest a moment, recollect myself, find the strength to pull out the handheld I kept in my coat and call for help, or discover some other way to leave here, and if it meant I dragged myself out on the bloody, useless remains of my limbs, I would do that, pain or no pain, or I would die trying.14   One of the three Mianaais did not even arrive at the Var deck, but transmitted the code for my central access deck.Invalid access, I thought, receiving it, but stopped the lift on that level and opened the door anyway.That Mianaai made her way to my main console, gestured up records, scanned quickly through a century of log headings.Stopped, frowned, at a point in the list that would have been made in the five years surrounding that last visit, that I had concealed from her.The other two of her stowed their bags in quarters, and went to the newly lit and slowly warming Var decade room.Both of her sat at the table, the silent colored glass Valskaayan saint smiling mildly down.
