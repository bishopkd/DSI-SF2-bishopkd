The respectful convention, however, was either to keep a dead relative in a special ceremonial chamber at home and let them decay until their density would ensure a swift passage into the liquid hydrogen far beneath, or  if time was pressing  to weight the body and consign it to the Depths that way.Hatherence had no family here.There was not even anybody of her own species in all Nasqueron, and so  as, at least, a fellow alien  Fassin had been declared responsible for her remains.Hed agreed a swift dispatch to the Depths was preferable to keeping her body and handing it back to the Shrievalty or any family she might still have in Ulubis system.He wasnt even sure why he felt that way, but he did.There was no particular veneration of the remains of the dead in the way of the Truth, and, as far as he knew, no special meaning amongst oerileithe in having their dead returned from afar, but even if there had been, hed have wanted something like this.For the Dwellers, it was probably just administrative convenience, even tidiness to dispose of her now, like this.For him, it was something more.Fassin looked down at the alien body  thin and dark, something between a manta and a giant starfish  lying in its coffin of meteorite iron.Iron had always been and, sentimentally, ceremonially, still was a semi precious metal for Dwellers.That they were burying Hatherence like this was something of an honour, he supposed.In the fading light, her ragged remains, dark anyway, then burned by the beam which had killed her, looked like scraps of shadow.Fassin felt tears in his real eyes, inside the shock gel inside the little gascraft that was his own tiny life coffin, and knew that some deep, near animal part of him was mourning not so much the fallen Oculan colonel as all the people he knew whom hed lost recently, lost without seeing them one last time, even in death, lost without fully being able to believe that he really had lost them because it had all happened so far away with so much in between them and him to stop him returning to pay any sort of respects to them, lost in his intellect but not his emotions, because even now, some part of him refused to believe he would never see all those lost ones again.I confess, Setstyin said, I have no idea what form of words one ought to use on such occasions, Seer Taak.Do you?Amongst some aHumans there is a saying that we come from and go to nothing, a lack like shadow that throws the sum of life into bright relief.And with the rHumans, something about dust to ashes.Do you think she would have minded being treated as a Dweller?Setstyin asked.No, Fassin said.I dont think she would have minded.I think she would have felt honoured.Here, here, Ysul muttered.Valseir gave a small formal bow.Well, Colonel Hatherence, Setstyin said, with what sounded like a sigh as he looked down at the body lying in the coffin.You ascended to the age and rank of Mercatorial Colonel, which is a very considerable achievement for your kind.We think you lived well and we know you died well.You died with many others but in the end we all die alone.You died more alone than others, amongst people like you but alien to you, and far from your home and family.You fell and were found and now we send you down again, further into those Depths, to join all the revered dead on the surface of rock around the core.He looked at Fassin.Seer Taak, would you like to say anything?Fassin tried to think of something.In the end he just said, I believe Colonel Hatherence was a good person.She was certainly a brave one.I only knew her for less than a hundred days and she was always my military superior, but I came to like her and think of her as a friend.She died trying to protect me.Ill always honour her memory.He signalled that he could think of nothing else.Setstyin roll nodded and indicated the open coffin lid.Fassin went forward and used a manipulator to close the caskets iron hatch, then he lowered a little more and together he and Setstyin took one edge of the bier that the coffin lay on.They raised it, letting the heavy container slide silently off, over the edge of the balcony and down into the next bruise dark layer of clouds, far below.They all floated over the edge and waited until the coffin disappeared, a tiny black speck vanishing into the darkly purple wastes.Great cousin of mine, diving deep, got hit by one of those once, Ysul said thoughtfully.Never knew what hit him.Stone dead.The others were looking at him.He shrugged.Well?Its true.Valseir found Fassin in a gallery, looking out at the deep night stream of gas, rushing quietly in infrared as the Isaut powered its way to who knew where.Fassin.Valseir.Are we free to leave yet?Not that Ive heard.Not yet.They watched the night flow round them together for a while.Fassin had spent time earlier looking at reports on the storm battle, from both sides.The Dwellers had high selectivity visuals which made it look like the Dreadnoughts had won the day, not the Isaut.The little hed got from the Mercatorias nets just gave dark hints that an entire fleet was missing, and included no visuals at all.Unseen was pretty much unheard of.It appeared that everybody had instantly assumed there was some vast cover up going on.Both sides were downplaying like crazy, implying that some terrible misunderstanding had taken place and theyd both suffered appallingly heavy losses, which was, when Fassin thought about it, somewhere between half and three quarters true, and hence closer to reality than might have been expected in the circumstances.So what did happen to this folder?Fassin asked.If there was a folder.There was and is a folder, Fassin, Valseir told him.Iheld on to it for a long time but eventually, twenty one, twenty three years ago, I gave it to my colleague and good friend Leisicrofe.He was departing on a research trip.Has he returned?No.When will he?Should he return, he wont have the data.Where will it be?Wherever he left it.I dont know.How do I find your friend Leisicrofe?Youll have to follow him.That will not be so easy.You will need help.I have Ysul.Hes always arranged  You will need rather more than he can provide.Fassin looked at the old Dweller.Off planet?Is that what you mean?Somewhat, Valseir said, not looking at him, gazing out at the onward surge of night.Then who should I approach for this help?Ive already taken the liberty.You have?Thats very kind.Valseir was silent for a while, then said, None of this is about kindness, Fassin.He turned to look directly at the arrowhead.Nobody in their right mind would ever want to be involved with something as momentous as this.If the slightest part of what youre looking for has any basis in reality, it could change everything for all of us.I am Dweller.My species has made a good, long  if selfish  life for itself, spread everywhere, amongst the stars.We do not appreciate change on the scale we are here talking about.Im not sure that any species would.Some of us will do anything to avoid such change, to keep things just as they are.You have to realise, Fassin; we are not a monoculture, we are not at all perfectly homogenised.We are differentiated in ways that even now, after all your exposure to us, you can scarcely begin to comprehend.There are things within our own worlds almost entirely hidden from most of us, and there are deep and profound differences of opinion between factions amongst us, just as there are between the Quick.Factions, thought Fassin.Valseir went on, Not all of us are quite so studiedly indifferent to events taking place within the greater galaxy as we generally contrive to appear.There are those of us who, without ever wanting to know the full details of your mission, in fact knowing that theyd be unable to square knowledge of its substance with their species loyalty, would help you nevertheless.Others others would kill you instantly if they even began to guess what it was youre looking for.The old Dweller floated over, came close to a kiss whisper as he said,  And believe it or not, Fassin Taak, Drunisine is of the former camp, while your friend Setstyin is of the latter.Fassin pulled away to look at the old Dweller, who added,  Truly.After a few more moments, Fassin asked, When will I be able to follow your friend Leisicrofe?I think youll know one way or the other before the night is out.And if we both dont at least begin to follow Leisicrofe, we may both follow your Colonel Hatherence.Fassin thought this sounded a little melodramatic.Truly?he asked, signalling amusement.Oh, truly, Fassin, Valseir said, signalling nothing.Let me repeat: none of this is about kindness.* * *  Saluus Kehar was not happy.He had his own people in certain places, his own ways of finding things out, his own secure and reliable channels of intelligence quite independent of the media and the official agencies  you didnt become and stay a major military supplier unless you did  and he knew about as well as anybody did what had happened during the disastrous Nasqueron raid, and it was simply unjust to blame him or his firm.For one thing, theyd been betrayed, or their intelligence or signals had been compromised, or at the very least theyd been out thought (by Dwellers!).And because of that failing  which was unquestionably nothing to do with him  theyd been ambushed and out outnumbered.Dozens of those heretofore un fucking heard of super Dreadnought ships had turned up when the incursionary force had been expecting no more than a handful  at most  of the standard ones, the models without the reactive mirror armour, the plasma engines and the wideband lasers.Plus the Dwellers had simply done a very good job of lying over the years  years?Aeons  presenting themselves as hopeless bumblers and technological incompetents when in fact  even if they couldnt build anything very impressive from scratch any more  they still had access to weaponry of serious lethality.The military had fucked up.It didnt matter how good the tool was, how clever the craftsman had been, how well made the weapon was; if the user dropped it, didnt switch it on or just didnt know how to use it properly, all that good work went for nothing.Theyd lost all the ships.All of them.Every single damn one, either on the raid or supporting it from space immediately above.Even a few of the ships not involved at all  those standing guard round Third Fury while the recovery and construction teams worked  had been targeted and annihilated by some sort of charged particle beam weapon, with two craft on the far side of the moon each chased by some type of hyper velocity missile and blown to smithereens as well.Unwilling to accept that theyd made a complete mess of the operation, the military had decided it mustnt be their fault.Kehar Heavy Industries must be to blame.There must, to quote an ancient saying, be something wrong with our bloody ships.The sheer completeness of the catastrophe, and the frustrating lack of detail regarding exactly what had gone wrong, actually made it easier to blame the tool rather than the workman.All the ships had been made gas capable by Saluuss shipyards, all had been lost on their first mission using their new abilities, so  according to that special logic only the military mind seemed to appreciate  it must be a problem with the process of making them capable of working in an atmosphere that was responsible.Never mind that the battlecruiser acting as Command and Control for the whole operation and both the Heavy Armour Battery Monitors had been blasted to atoms just as effortlessly as the ships working in the planets clouds, even though theyd never been gas capabled and were still in space at the time; that little detail somehow got rolled up into greater disaster and conveniently forgotten about in the hysteria.So now theyd lost Fassin and theyd lost their lead to this Dweller List thing.Worse, they had a serious intelligence problem, because, basically, theyd been duped.The old Dweller Valseir must have suspected something or been tipped off.They knew this for the simple reason that the information hed provided  almost the last data that had got relayed back to the top brass on Sepekte before everything went haywire  had proved, when checked later, to be a lie.The Dweller hed told Fassin to look for in Deilte city didnt exist.For the sake of this theyd lost over seventy first rate warships for no gain whatsoever  ships they would seriously miss when the Beyonder Starveling invasion hit home for real  and theyd thoroughly antagonised the Dwellers, whod never been people it was advisable to get on the wrong side of even before theyd suddenly shown they still packed the kind of punch that could humiliate a Mercatorial fleet.As military fuck ups went it was a many faceted gem, a work of genius, a grapeshot, multi stage, cluster warhead, fractal munition regenerative weapon system of a fuck up.In fact it was only that last item on the long list of calamitous consequences  dealing with the Dwellers subsequent actions and signals  that had worked out less badly than it might have.Finally, something positive.Saluus was in a meeting.He hated meetings.They were an entirely vital part of being an industrialist, indeed of being a businessman in any sort of organisation, but he still hated them.Hed learned, partly at his fathers side, to get good at meetings, working people and information before, during and after them, but even when they were short and decided important stuff they felt like a waste of time.And they were rarely short and rarely decided important stuff.This one wasnt even his meeting.Unusually, he wasnt in control.Hed been summoned.Summoned?Hed been brought before them.That caught the mood better.He far preferred conference calls, holo meetings.They tended to be shorter (though not always  if you had one where everybody was somewhere they felt really comfortable, they could go on for ever too) and they were easier to control  easier to dismiss, basically.But there seemed to be this distribution curve of meeting reality: people at the bottom of the organisational pile had lots of real all sat down together meetings  often, Saluus had long suspected, because they had nothing useful to do and so had the time to spare and the need to seem important that meetings could provide.Those in the middle and towards the top had more and more holo meetings because it was just more time efficient and the people they needed to meet with were of similarly high stature with their own time problems and often far away.But then  this was the slightly weird bit  as you got to the very highest levels, the proportion of face to face meetings started to rise again.Maybe because it was a sign of how much youd been able to delegate, maybe because it was a way of imposing your authority on those in the middle and upper middle ranks beneath you, maybe because the things being discussed at high level meetings were so important that you needed the very last nuance of physicality they provided over a holo conference to be sure that you were working with all the relevant information, including whether somebody was sweating or had a nervous tic.This was the sort of stuff a good holo would show up, of course, though equally the sort of stuff a good pre transmission image editing camera would smooth away.In theory somebody in a conference call could be sitting there sweating a river and jumping like theyd been electrocuted, but if they had decent real time image editing facilities they could look the perfect epitome of unruffled cucumber chill.Though there was stuff you could do in reality, too, of course.For his thirteenth birthday, Saluuss father had given his son a surprise party and, later, a surprise present in the shape of a visit to a Finishing Clinic, where, over the course of a long and not entirely pain free month, they fixed his teeth, widened his eyes and altered their colour (Saluus had been womb sculpted for the appearance hed had, but, hey, a father could change his mind).More to the point, they made him much less fidgety, upped his capacity to concentrate and gave him control over his sweat glands, pheromone output and galvanic skin response (the last three not strictly legal, but then the clinic was owned by a subsidiary of Kehar Heavy Industries).All good for giving one an edge in meetings, discussions and even informal get togethers.And usefully applicable to the art of seduction, too, where ones blatant proximity to and control over astounding quantities of cash had somehow failed to have the desired effect.This was a meeting of the Emergency War Cabinet, a high level top brass get together in a klicks deep command bunker complex beneath one of a handful of discreetly well guarded mansions dotted round the outskirts of greater Borquille State.A high level top brass get together minus the Hierchon Ormilla himself, however.He was patently too grand to attend a mere meeting, even of something as important as the Emergency War Cabinet, even when the fate of the System was in even greater jeopardy than it had been before the disastrous decision to go mob handed into the atmosphere of Nasqueron the instant they thought they had a firm lead to the  anyway probably mythical  Dweller List.And why did meetings always make his mind wander, and, specifically, make it wander towards  wander towards?Head straight for  sex?He looked at women he was attending meetings with and found it very hard not to imagine them naked.This happened when they werent especially attractive, but was inevitable and often vivid if they were even slightly good looking.Something about being able to look at them for long periods when they were talking, he suspected.Or just the urge to shuck off the whole civilised thing of being good little officers of the company and get back to being cave people again, humping in the dirt.First Secretary Heuypzlagger was wittering.Saluus was confident that he looked like he was hanging on the First Secretarys every word, and that his short term memory would snick him back in should he need to return his full attention to proceedings if and when anything else of genuine import stumbled into view.But in the meantime, having already gleaned as much as he felt he was likely to regarding the real state of things from the body language and general demeanour of his fellow meeters, he felt free to let his mind wander.He glanced at Colonel Somjomion, who was the only woman at this meeting.She didnt tend to say very much so you didnt get too many opportunities to look straight at her.Not especially attractive (though he was, hed been telling himself recently, starting to appreciate women rather than girls, and see past the more obvious sexual characteristics).There was, certainly, something especially exciting about the idea of undressing a woman in uniform, but hed long since been there and done that and had the screenage to prove it.He thought of his latest lover instead.Saluus thought of her last night, this morning, he thought of her the night theyd first met, first slept together.He quickly got an almost painfully hard erection.Theyd sculpted him to have control over that at the Finishing Clinic as well, but he usually just let things rise and fall of their own accord down there, unless either the presence or the absence was going to be socially embarrassing.Anyway, hed long since accepted that maybe it was a way of getting back at dear old dad, for forcing all this amendment stuff on him in the first place, however useful it had proved.He still hated meetings.Saluus supposed things had gone reasonably well for him in this one so far, considering.Hed had to agree to a full inquiry into the gas capabling of the ships theyd modified as part of the general investigation into what had gone wrong, but  even allowing for the implied insult and the waste of time, just when they didnt need it  that wasnt too terrible.Hed managed to deflect most of the criticism by getting the Navarchy, the Guard and the Shrievalty Ocula representatives to compete for who was least to blame for the whole botched raid thing.That had worked well.Divide and conquer.That wasnt difficult in the current system.In fact it was set up for it.He remembered asking his father about this back when Saluus was still being tutored at home.Why the confusion of agencies?Why the plethora (hed just discovered the word, enjoyed using it) of military and security and other organisations within the Mercatoria?Just look at warships: there were the Guard  they had warships, the Navarchy Military  they had warships, the Ambient Squadrons  they had warships, the Summed Fleet  obviously they had warships, and then there were the Engineers, the Propylaea, the Omnocracy, the Cessorian Lustrals, the Shrievalty, the Shrievalty Ocula and even the Administrata.They all had their own ships, and each even had a few warships as well, for important escort duties.Why so many?Why divide your forces?The same went for security.Everybody seemed to have their own security service too.Wasnt this wasteful?Oh, definitely, his father had said.But theres opportunity in waste.And what some call waste others would call redundancy.But do you really want to know what its all about?Of course he did.Divide and conquer.Even amongst your own.Competition.Also even amongst your own.In fact, especially amongst your own.Keep them all at each others throats, keep them all watching each other, keep them all wondering what the other lot might be up to.Make them compete for your attention and approval.Yes, its wasteful, looked at one way, but its wise, looked at another.This is how the Culmina keep everything under control, young man.This is how they rule us.And it appears to work, dont you think?Hmm?Saluus hadnt been sure at the time.The sheer wastefulness of it all distressed him.He was older and wiser now and more used to the way that things really worked being more important than the way they appeared to (unless you were talking about public perception, of course, when it was the other way round).But they really were facing a mortal and imminent threat here.Was it right to encourage division and enmity between people who and organisations which all needed to pull together if they were to defeat the threat they were faced with?Oh, but fuck it.There would always be competition.Armed services were designed to protect turf, to engage with, to prevail against.Of course theyd compete with each other.And, if that supposedly fucking enormous and ultimately powerful Mercatoria fleet wasnt rushing towards them even now, would not some of the people in Ulubis  maybe quite a lot of the people in Ulubis  be contemplating not resisting the Beyonder Starveling invasion at all?Might they not, instead, be thinking about how they could come to an accommodation with those threatening invasion?Despite all the propaganda theyd been subject to, secret polls and secret police reports indicated that a lot of ordinary people felt they might not be any worse off under the Beyonder\ Starveling forces.Some people in power would feel the same way, especially if they were being told to sacrifice property and wealth and even risk their own lives in what might turn out to be a lost cause.Even some of those round this impressively large round table in this impressively large and cool and subtly lit boardroom resembling meeting chamber might have been tempted to think about ways to cope with the threatened invasion that didnt involve resistance to the last ship and soldier, if it hadnt been for the oncoming Mercatoria Fleet.Saluus supposed they had to assume that the fleet really was on the way.There were other possibilities, and hed thought them all through  and talked them all through with his own advisers and experts  but ultimately they had to be dismissed.Whether the Dweller List existed or not, everybody appeared to be acting as though it did, and that was all that mattered.It was a bit like money: all about trust, about faith.The value lay in what people believed, not in anything intrinsic.Never mind.After covering the latest intelligence and his own.shocking remissness in not making the refitted ships invulnerable to alien hyper weapons, the meeting was finally getting round to something useful.Back to grisly reality.The main thing, Fleet Admiral Brimiaice told them (the quaup commander was keen on Main Things and In The Ends), is that the Dwellers dont seem to want to continue hostilities.After their initial, furious take no prisoners attack and no quarter polishing off of those whod got away, the Dwellers had just as suddenly gone back to their usual show of Shucks us?ineptitude, claiming it had all been a terrible mistake and could they help with the Third Fury rebuild?And thank fuck for that!Guard General Thovin said.If they did, wed have absolutely no chance.Facing the Beyonder Starveling lot and the Dwellers as well!Holy shit!No chance.No chance at all!Thovin was a dumpy barrel of a man, dark and powerful looking.His voice was suitably gruff.Instead, only almost no chance, Shrievalty Colonel Somjomion said with a thin smile.We have every chance, madam!Fleet Admiral Brimiaice thundered, banging the table with one tubular armling.His splendidly uniformed and decorated body, like a well tailored airship the size of a small hippo, rose in the air.We need no defeatist talk here, of all places!We have seventy fewer ships than we had, the Shrievalty colonel reminded them, without drama.We still have the will, Brimiaice said.Thats the important point.And we have plenty of ships.And more being built all the time.He looked at Saluus, who nodded and tried not to let his contempt show.If they work, muttered Clerk Regnant Voriel.The Cessorian seemed to have a personal thing against Saluus.He had no idea why.Now, weve dealt with all that, First Secretary Heuypzlagger said quickly, glancing at Saluus.If there are any problems with the ships construction, Im sure the inquiry will show them up.We have to concentrate now on what else we can do.Saluus was getting bored.Now was as good a time as any.An embassy, he said.He looked round them all.Thats what Id like to suggest.An embassy to the Dwellers of Nasqueron, to secure peace, make sure there are no more misunderstandings between us and them, attempt to involve them in the defence of Ulubis system and, if possible, acquire from them  with their consent, preferably  some of the extremely impressive weaponry they appear to possess, either in physical or theoretical form.Well, Heuypzlagger said, shaking his head.Oh.Now our Acquisitariat friend is a diplomat, Voriel observed, expression poised between sneer and smile.Needing yet more supposedly gas capable ships to protect it, no doubt!Brimiaice protested.Havent we got one already?Thovin asked.Colonel Somjomion just looked at him, eyes narrowed.The meeting only seemed to last for ever.Finally it was over.Saluus met up with his new lover that evening, at the water column house on Murla, where hed first really looked at her in the true light of day and decided, yes, hed be interested.It had been at brunch, with his wife (and her new girlfriend) and Fass and the Segrette Twins, the day after their visit to the Narcateria in Boogeytown.* * *  The RushWing Sheumerith rode high in the clear gas spaces between two high haze layers, flying into the vast unending jet stream of gas as though trying to keep pace with the stars which were sometimes visible, tiny and hard and remote, through the yellow haze and the thin quick amber clouds scudding eternally overhead.The giant aircraft was a single slim scimitar of wing pocked with engine nacelles, articulated like a wave, ten kilometres across, a hundred metres long and ten metres high, a thin filament forever jetting like a swift weather front made visible across the waste of clouds beneath.Dwellers, hundreds of them, hung from it, each anchored like refuelled aircraft by a cable strung out from the wings trailing edge, riding in a little pocket of calm gas produced by simple shells of diamond, open to the rear and which, to the human eye, were shaped like a pair of giant cupped hands.In a long term drug trance, downshifted in time so that the flight seemed twelve or sixty or more times quicker than it really was  the vast continents of clouds racing beneath like foam, the wash of stars wheeling madly above, wisp banks whipping towards and past like rags in a hurricane  the wing hung Dwellers watched the days and nights flicker around them like some stupendous strobe and felt the planet beneath them turn like something reeling out their lives.Fassin Taak left the jetclipper and flew carefully in, matching velocities, then anchored the little gascraft, very slowly, to the underside of the diamond enclosure holding the Sage youth Zosso, a slim, dark, rather battered looking Dweller of two million years or so.Fassin slow timed.The wing, the clouds, the stars, all seemed to pick up speed, rolling racing forward like over cranked screenage.The roar of engines and slipstreaming gas rose and rose in pitch, becoming a high, shrill, faraway keening, then vanishing from hearing altogether.The Dweller above him, seeming to jerk and quiver in his little retaining harness, waited for him to synch before sending,  And what might you be, person?I am a human being, sir.A Seer at the Nasqueron Court,  in a gascraft, an esuit.I am called Fassin Taak, of Sept Bantrabal.And I am Zosso, of nowhere in particular.Of here.Good view, is it not?It is.However, I dare say that that is not why you are here.Youre right.Its not.You wish to ask me something?I am told I need to make passage to somewhere Ive never heard of, to follow a Dweller I need to find.Im told you can help.Im sure I can, if I choose to.Well, that is, if people still take any notice of what a silly old wing hanger says.Who can say?Im not sure that I would listen to somebody as old and out of things as I am if I was a young travelcaptain.Why, I think I should say something like, What, listen to that foolish old?Oh, I beg your pardon, young human.I seem to have distracted myself.Where was it you would like to go?A place that is, apparently, sometimes called Hoestruem.Drunisine himself, alone, had come to the quarters that Fassin shared with the two Dwellers, in the mid morning of the day after the battle in the storm.We have delayed you long enough.You may go.A jetclipper is at your disposal for the next two dozen days.Goodbye.Now there, Ysul had observed, goes a Dweller of few words.Hoestruem?Zosso asked.No, Ive never heard of it either.Night swept over them as he signalled, enveloping.In or near Aopoleyin?Fassin sent.Apparently, he told the old wing hanger, when the Dweller was uncommunicative for a few moments.Somewhere associated with Aopoleyin.All this was on Valseirs advice.Fassin couldnt find any mention of anywhere called Aopoleyin in his databases either.He was starting to wonder if the memory scanning process hed had to undergo before being allowed to leave the Isaut had scrambled some of the gascrafts information storage systems.Ah, Zosso sent.Aopoleyin.That I have heard of.Hmm.Well, in that case, if I were you, Id talk to Quercer Janath.Yes, youll need them.I should think.Tell them I sent you.Oh.And ask for my mantle scarf back.Might do the trick.No guarantees, though.Mind.Quercer and Janath.Your mantle scarf back.The old Dweller rolled a fraction, jerkily, and looked down at Fassin.Ill have you know it was a very good mantle scarf.He rolled back, facing again into the never ending rush of cloud and stars and day and night.I could do with it up here.Its windy.FIVE:  CONDITIONS OF PASSAGE   Where?You want to go where?Hoestruem, near Aopoleyin, Fassin said.We know where Hoestruem is.Were not stupid.Well, Im not.Janath might be.I entirely fulfilled my Creat Minimum Stupidity Allocation by associating with you.Forgive my partner.We were asking for confirmation more out of shock at your unspeakable alienness than anything else.So.You want to go to Hoestruem.Yes, Fassin said.And Zosso sent you.Still banging on about that damn scarf.Useful code, though.Hoestruem.Hoestruem.Doable.Yes, but its more the why of it, not the how.The how is easy.The how is easy.Problem is definitely why.As in bother.As in should we.Well, should we?More rhetorical.Has to be a joint decision.Absolutely.Zosso asks.Zosso does.Do we accommodate?We could just give him back his mantle scarf.Was there ever a scarf?A real scarf?Yes.Now you mention it.Anyway.Beside the point.Always a dangerous place to tarry  Zosso.A travel request.This human gentleman in his gascraft esuit.Ahem, said Ysul.And his friend.Not forgetting his friend.And mentor, Ysul pointed out.Yes, that too.Do we do or do we dont?Is the question.Does we does or dont we not?Yes.No.Select one of the aforementioned.Quite.Precisely.In your own time, Ysul muttered.They were in a spinbar in Eponia, a globular stickycity in the cold chaotic wastes of the North Polar Region.The borrowed jetclipper had done its best impression of a suborb, skipping nearly into space in a series of bounced trajectories, finally slowing, sinking and coming to rest by the tenuous cloudlike structure of the great city, occupying hundreds of cubic kilometres of cold, stale gas just fifteen thousand klicks from the giant planets North Pole.Theyd tracked Quercer Janath down to a spinbar called The Liquid Yawn.Valseir had demurred but Ysul and Fassin had crammed into a crushpod, been accelerated up to speed and then  dizzily  joined the two travelcaptains in their booth.Fassin had never encountered a travelcaptain before.Hed heard of them, and knew that they were almost always found in the equatorial band, but they were elusive, even shy.Hed tried to meet with one many times in the past but there had always been some sort of problem, often at the last moment.The spinbar whirled madly, twisting and looping and rolling at extreme high speed, making the city outside its bubble diamond walls seem to gyrate as though with the express intention of disorientating the outward looking bar going public.The effect was intense and intentional.Dwellers had a superb sense of balance and it took a lot to make them dizzy.Being spun like a maniac was one Dweller idea of fun just because it led to a profound, giddy dislocation with ones surroundings.Taking drugs at the same time just added to the hilarity.Ysul, however, it had seemed to Fassin, looked a little grey around the gills as theyd woven their way through the mostly empty spinbar to the travelcaptains booth.You all right?Perfectly  Bringing back memories of heading through the storm wall in the Poaflias?Not at Well, just a little.Ulp.Perhaps.Quercer Janath, travelcaptains, were one.They looked like one big Dweller, of about Adult age, but there were two individuals in there, one in each discus.Fassin had heard of truetwin Dwellers before, but never met a set.Usually a Dwellers brain was housed just off the central spine in the thickest, central part of one discus; generally the left one.Right brain Dwellers were about fifteen per cent of the total population, though this varied from planet to planet.Very, very occasionally, two brains developed in the one creature, and something like Quercer Janath tended to be the result.The double Dweller wore a shiny set of all overs with transparent and mesh patches over the hub sense organs, and a shaded transparent section over the outer frill of sensory fringe.Youll not be able to see much.Thats if we take you at all.Yes, thats if we do take you in the first.Place.Which is by no means guaranteed.Indeed not.Decision not yet made.Still pending.Absolutely.But.In any event.Youll not be able to see much of anything.Not exactly a sightseeing trip.Or a cruise.Either.And youll have to switch everything off.All non bio systems.At least.If, that is.Big if.We do take you.I think we get the idea, Fassin said.Good.Brilliant.When can we expect a decision?Ysul asked.Hed turned his right sense fringe inward so that he was seeing with only one.This was the Dweller equivalent of a drunk human closing one eye.Made it.Ive made it.You made it?Yep, Ive made it.Its a Yes?Its a Yes.Youll take us?Fassin asked.Are you deaf?Yes.Definitely.Thank you, Fassin said.So where are we going?Ysul asked tetchily.Ah.Ha!Wait.And see.The ship was no joke.Three hundred metres long, it was a polished ebony spike necklaced with drive pods like fat seeds.It lay in a public hangar deep under the stickycity, a semi spherical space a kilometre across bounded by the hexagonal planes of adjacent smaller bubble volumes.Valseir was bidding them farewell here.The trip would begin with what the two travelcaptains described as an intense, fractally spiralled, high acceleration, torque intense manoeuvre complex, and was not for the faint willed.The old Dweller had invoked his seniority to excuse himself the ordeal.More spinning around, Ysul sighed, on hearing what awaited them.My regards to Leisicrofe, Valseir told Fassin.You still have the leaf image, I hope.Fassin took the image leaf with its depiction of sky and clouds out of its storage locker in the little gascraft and showed it to the old Dweller.Ill say hello.Please do.Best of luck.You too.How do I find you when I get back?Leave that to me.If Im not readily available, try where we found Zosso.Or, perhaps at a StormSail regatta.Yes, Ysul said.But next time just dont bring any friends.The black spike ship was called the Velpin.It burst from the vast cloud of the city like a needle shot from a frozen waterfall of foam, disappeared into the gelid rush of gases forever swirling around the planets distant pole and started its bizarre flight, spiralling, rolling, looping, rising and falling and rising again.Locked into a centrally positioned space which doubled as a passenger compartment and hold, restrained by webbing, Fassin and Ysul felt the ship commit to spirals within spirals within spirals, tiny corkscrew motions threaded into a whole ramped course of greater coils, themselves part of a still wider set of ever quicker, tighter loops.Fucking hell, Ysul commented.A faulty screen was set in the far wall, hazed over with static.It made buzzing noises and occasionally flashed with images of ragged, striated clouds whipping past in distorted twists of light and shade.Fassin could see and hear, though both senses were degraded.All the systems in the gascraft had been switched off.Webbed upright, he could see out of the de opaqued plate over his face  hed let some of the shock gel drain away so he could see better.The sound that came through the little arrowhead was at once dulled and high.Ysuls voice sounded like squeaks, barely comprehensible.Fassin and Ysul were stuck to the inner surface of the compartment, pinned there by the ships wild spins.Any idea why they have to do all this fractal spiralling?Fassin had asked when theyd both been secured and Quercer Janath had gone to their command space a single compartment away.Could just be pure mischief, Ysul had said.Fassin looked at Ysul now.Both the Dwellers sense fringes were turned in.The ship accelerated hard, executing a broad curve.The screen flashed black pitted with stars, all revolving frantically, then blanked out.The insane, nested sets of spirals resolved down to a single long axis spin, as though the Velpin was a shell travelling down the barrel of some vast gun.The ship resounded with a high, singing note around them and seemed to settle into something like a cruise.The rate of spin slackened off gradually.Fassin watched as Ysuls sense fringes gradually opened.The screen showed slowly spinning stars for several minutes.Then it blanked out again.The spinning picked up once more and Ysul turned his fringes outside in again.The spin built up until Fassin could feel his whole body being pressed through the shock gel.It was his own coffin, he realised.Of course it was.He was getting tunnel vision now, starting to see the view down that great gun barrel, the view ahead shrunk to a single point far away; way, way in the distance, nothing but darkness and grey beyond darkness on either side, down that never ending tube towards the last defined place they were aiming towards, never coming any closer.Fassin woke up.Still spinning, but the rate was slackening off again.His nose itched and it felt like he needed to pee, even though he knew he didnt.This never happened when the shock gel and gillfluid were doing their jobs.He fell asleep.* * *  Taince Yarabokin woke up.One of her first thoughts as she surfaced slowly to full consciousness was that Saluus Kehar would not have received the message shed prepared for him, that there was still time for more reviewings and re recordings and revisions, that she would be able to spend more time watching and listening to herself on the recording, and reduce herself to tears every time.Still time and a chance to confront him, maybe kill him, if that was both possible and something she felt driven to do at the time (she had no idea  sometimes she wanted to kill him, sometimes she wanted him alive to suffer the shame of knowing that she had released the story to the newsnets, and sometimes she just wanted him to know that she knew what had really happened that long ago night in the ruined ship on the high desert).She checked the time, feeling woozily around in virtual space for information.Still half a year out from Ulubis.She would be awake now until the attack itself, one of the first to be wakened for the final run in, because she represented the closest thing they had to local knowledge.Privately she doubted shed be able to offer much practical help, given that shed last seen Ulubis over two centuries earlier and it might, to put it mildly, have changed somewhat after having been invaded, but she was the best they had.She thought of herself in that respect more as a talisman than anything else, a small symbol of the system that they would be fighting for.If that had been one consideration in her getting a place in the fleet, it didnt bother her.She was confident that she was a good, competent and brave officer and deserved her post on merit alone.The fact that it was her own home system she was riding to the rescue of was just a bonus.The fleet had spread out a little since the battle with the Beyonders in mid voyage, sacrificing the immediate weight of arms it could bring to bear for a net of forward picket craft which would flag any trouble long before the main body of the fleet got to it.Taince had spent most of the intervening years slow asleep in her pod, but  thanks to that relative security provided by the advance ships  shed had some recreational and morale time out of the shock gel as well, walking around almost like a normal human being in the spun gravity of the battleship, feeling odd and strange confronted with such normality, like an alien inhabiting a humans body; clumsy, astonished at tiny things like fingernails and the hairs on an arm, awkward, especially at first, with meeting other off duty humans, and missing the richness of her in pod, wired up virtual existence  with the ability to dip in and out of entire high definition sensoria of data and meaning  like an amputated limb.It would be like that again now, once she had finally come round.Taince wasnt really looking forward to it.When she was stumbling about on two legs she wanted to be back in the pod, synched in, but when she was there she was forever nostalgic for a normal, physical one speed, one reality life.Blue skies and sunlight, a fresh breeze blowing through her hair and green grass and flowers under her bare feet.Long time ago.And maybe never again, who knew?Another of Tainces first thoughts, even when she realised that she was being woken up slowly, without alarms going off, as part of the programmed, pre agreed duty shift system rather than some fateful emergency that might end in her death at any moment, was that she had not yet escaped into death, that it was not yet all over, and any terrors and agonies that might be hers to encounter before the peace of oblivion were still ahead of her.* * *  Hoestruem, Quercer Janath said.Where?Fassin asked.What do you mean, Where??Youre in it.Fassin had recovered from his blackout once theyd turned his little gascrafts systems back on.He still felt disorientated and oddly dirty, a sensation that was only gradually disappearing as the shock gel enveloped him fully again.Ysul had seemed a bit groggy too, wobbly in the air when released from his webbing.Now they were looking at the passenger compartment screen, which Quercer Janath, still dressed in their shiny overalls, had hit with one rim arm and got to work.Fassin looked carefully at the image on the screen but all he could see was a star field.He could not, for now, work out in which direction he was looking.Certainly not a direction he was used to looking in.He didnt recognise anything.In it?he asked, feeling fuzzy, and foolish.Yes, in it.Fassin looked at Ysul, who still looked a little grey about the mantle.The Dweller just shrugged.Well, he said, I certainly give in.Who, what or where the fuck is Hoestruem?A Clouder.A Clouder?Fassin said.This had to be a translation thing, or a simple misunderstanding.Clouders were part of the Cincturia: the beings, devices, semi civs and tech dross that were beyond the Beyonders, way on the outside of everything.Ysul shook himself.You mean a WingClouder or TreeClouder or StickyClouder or  No.None of the above.Just a Clouder.But Fassin said.Aopoleyin, then!Ysul shouted.Lets start with that!Is that where we are?Yes.Indeed.Well, sort of.Depends.Its the nearest place.The nearest system.Eh?Ysul said.The nearest what?Fassin asked, simply not understanding.He peered at the star field.This didnt look right.This didnt look right at all.Not in any way whatsoever, not upside down or mirrored or backside holod or anything.I think Im still confused, Ysul said, rippling his sense mantles to wake himself up.Fassin felt as though he was at the bottom of that gun barrel again, about to be blasted out of it, or already being blown out of it, up the biggest, longest most unspeakably enormous and forever unending gun barrel in all the whole damn universe.How far are we from Nasqueron?he heard himself say.Wait a moment, Ysul said slowly.What do you mean, system?About thirty four kiloyears.Stellar, not gas giant.Apologies for any confusion.Thirty four kiloyears?Fassin said.It felt like he was going to black out again.You mean His voice just trailed off.Thirty four thousand light years, standard.Roughly.Apologies for any confusion.I already said that.Know.Different person, different confusion.They were in another system, another solar system, another part of the galaxy altogether; they had, if they were being told the truth, left Ulubis  system and star  thirty four thousand light years behind.There was a working portal in Ulubis system linked via a wormhole to this distant stellar system neither Fassin nor Ysul had ever heard of.The Clouder being Hoestruem was a light year across.Clouders were  depending who you talked to  sentient, semi sentient, proto sentient, a sentient or just plain not remotely sentient  though that last extreme point of view tended to be held only by those for whom it would be convenient if it were true, such as those who could do useful, profitable things with a big cloud of gas.Providing it wasnt alive.Arguably closer to vast, distributedly smart plants than any sort of animal, they had a composition very similar to the clouds of interstellar gas which they inhabited\were (the distinction was moot).Clouders were part of the Cincturia, the collection of beings, species, machine strains and intelligent detritus that existed  generally  between stellar systems and didnt fit into any other neat category (so they werent the deep space cometarians called the Eclipta, they werent drifting examples of the Brown Dwarf Communitals known as the Plena, and they werent the real exotics, the Non Baryonic Penumbrae, the thirteen way folded Dimensionates or the Flux dwelling Quantarchs).Valseirs friend Leisicrofe was a scholar of the Cincturia.The research trip he was making was a field trip, visiting actual examples of Cincturia  Clouders, Sailpods, Smatter, Toilers and the rest  throughout the galaxy.He had come to visit Hoestruem because it was one of the few Clouders anywhere near a worm hole portal.Only it wasnt a wormhole or a portal that anybody in the Mercatoria or the rest of what called itself the Civilised Galaxy knew anything about.The star Aopoleyin was only a dozen light days away.The Clouder Hoestruem  much larger than the stellar system as measured to its outermost planet  was passing partly through the outer reaches of the system, intent (if that was not too loaded a word) on its slow migration to some far distant part of the great lens.The Dweller Leisicrofe was somewhere here, in his own small craft, or at least had been.The Velpin set out to look for him.How long were we really under?Fassin asked Quercer Janath.They were floating in the Velpins control space, watching the scanners chatter through their sweeps, searching for anything that might be a ship.The progress was slow.The Dwellers had long had an agreement with the Clouders that meant their ships made very slow speed when moving through one.Clouders were resilient, but their individual filaments, the wispy bands and channels of tenuous gas that formed their sensory apparatus and nervous systems, were surpassing delicate, and a ship the size of the Velpin had to move slowly and carefully amongst the strands of Clouder substance to avoid causing damage.The Velpin was broadcasting a signal hail looping a request for Leisicrofe to get in touch, though Quercer Janath was not optimistic this would raise their quarry; these academics were notorious for turning off their comms.The truetwin looked genuinely puzzled.The double creature shook itself, rustling the shiny crinkles of the mirror finish coveralls.How long were you under what?How long were we really unconscious?Fassin asked.Some days.And then some more days.Seriously, Fassin said.And whats this we?Ysul protested.I wasnt unconscious!There.You see?Your friend disagrees.Some days, you said, Fassin quoted.Some days?Ysul said.Some days?We werent unconscious for some days, any days, a single day!He paused.Were we?The process takes some time, requires forbearance, the truetwin Dweller said.Sleep is best.No distractions.How could we possibly keep you amused?And then theres the security aspect.Of course.I was only briefly drowsy!Ysul exclaimed.I shut my eyes for a moment, in contemplation, no more!About twenty six days.We were unconscious for twenty six days?Fassin asked.Standard.Roughly.What?Ysul bellowed.You mean we were kept unconscious?In a manner of speaking, yes.In a manner of speaking!a plainly furious Ysul roared.What we said.And what manner of speaking would that be, you kidnapping piratical wretches?The manner of speaking complete truth.You mean you drugged or zapped us unconscious?Ysul fairly howled.Yes.Very boring otherwise.How dare you?Ysul shrieked.Plus its part of the terms for using the tube.Conditions of Passage, the left side of Quercer Janath intoned.The other side of the truetwin made a whistling noise.Oh, yes!Those Conditions of Passage; theyll get you every time.Cant be helpful with them.Cant use the tube without em.Dont  What?You  Condi  !Ysul spluttered.Ah, Fassin said, signalling to Ysul to let him speak.Yes.Id like to ask you some questions about, ah, tube travel, if you dont mind.Absolutely.Ask away.Make the questions good, though; the answers may well be baloney.Never heard anything so disgraceful in all my Ysul was muttering, drifting over to a set of medium range scanner holo tanks and tapping them as though this would aid the locating of Leisicrofes ship.Fassin had known theyd been under for more than an hour or two.His own physiology, and the amount of cleaning up and housekeeping the shock gel and gillfluid had had to do had told him that.Finding out that it had been twenty six days left him more relieved than anything else.Certainly losing that amount of time when you hadnt been expecting to and hadnt been warned about it was disconcerting and left one feeling sort of retrospectively vulnerable (and would it be the same on any way back?)but at least they hadnt said a year, or twenty six years.Fate alone knew what had happened in Ulubis during that time  and of course, with all his gascrafts systems switched off, Fassin had no way of checking whether this really was the amount of time they had spent unconscious  but it looked like at least one small part of the Dweller List legend was true.There were secret wormholes.There was one, for sure, and Fassin thought it unlikely in the extreme that the one between Ulubis and Aopoleyin was the only one.It was well worth losing a couple of dozen days to find that out.Fassin felt himself try to draw a breath inside the little gascraft.We did come through a wormhole?he asked.Excellent first question!Easily answerable in every sense!Yes.We did.Though we call them Cannula.Where is the Ulubis end  the Nasqueron end  of the worm hole, the Cannula?Where is the Adjutage?Fassin asked.Ah!He knows the terminology.Most impressive.And a very good question in one sense.Couldnt agree more.Phenomenally hopeless in another.Cant tell you.Security.Sure you understand.Of course I understand, Fassin said.Getting a straight answer to that one would have been too good to be true.How long has the wormhole existed?he asked.The truetwin was quiet for a moment, then said,  Dont know.For sure.Billions of years, probably.Possibly.How many others are there like it?Fassin asked.Imean wormholes; Cannula?Ditto.Ditto?Ditto as in  again  dont know.No idea.Well, some.All right, some idea.But cant tell.Conditions of Passage again.Drat those Conditions of Passage.Oh yes, drat.Are there any other wormholes from Ulubis  from anywhere near Ulubis system, say within its Oort radius  to anywhere else?Another good question.Cant tell you.More than our travelcaptaincys worth.This one, to Aopoleyin; does it link up with a Mercatoria wormhole?Does one of their wormholes have a portal, an Adjutage, here too?No.Agree.Straight answer.What a relief.No.And from here, from Aopoleyin, Fassin said.Are there other wormholes?Silence again for a moment.Then, Seems silly, but cant tell you.Like anybodys going to have just one stupid tube to this place.But still.Cant say.And thats official.Fassin signalled resignation.Conditions of Passage?he asked.Catching on.But why me?Fassin asked.Why you?Why you what?Why have I been allowed to travel here, to use the worm hole?You asked.More to the point, Valseir, Zosso and Drunisine asked on your behalf.How could we refuse?So I couldnt just have asked on my own behalf?Fassin said.Oh, you could have asked.Best leave that hanging.Attempt not to insult passengers.Unwritten law.Do you know of any other humans whove been allowed to use Dweller wormholes?No.No, indeed.Not that wed know, necessarily.Any other Seers?Not to our knowledge.Which is admittedly vague.Okay, Fassin said.He could feel his heart thudding in his chest, deep inside the little gascraft.Do you make journeys through the wormhole often?Define often.Let me rephrase: how many times have you used the worm hole in the last ten years standard?Easy question.To sidestep.But  say  a few hundred.Excuse our vagueness.Conditions of Passage.A few hundred?Fassin asked.Good grief, if that was true these guys were running round the galaxy in their hidden worm hole system like subway trains under a city.No more, assuredly.Are there many other ships like ?No, let me rephrase: how many other ships in Nasqueron make regular wormhole journeys?No idea.Havent the haziest.Not even roughly?Would there be dozens, hundreds?The left side of Quercer Janath briefly turned its shiny overalls transparent and flashed a pattern of high amusement over its signal skin.The right side made the whistling noise again.Fassin gave them time for a spoken answer, but it didnt appear.Are there a lot?he asked.Silence a while longer.There are a few.Not a few.Make what you will.Again, vagueness to be excused.Conditions of Passage.Thousands?Fassin asked.No response from the truetwin Dweller.He felt himself gulp.Tens of?No point going pursuing numbers uppage.See last answer given above.He had no idea.There just couldnt be all that many ships, could there?No matter how impressive your stealth tech, surely out of hundreds or thousands of ship movements within a system every year a few had to betray itself on some sort of sensor, now and again.No system was perfect, no technology never failed.Something had to show up.How far out did portals have to be?Fassin wasnt an expert on the physics, but he was fairly certain that you needed relatively flat space, well away from a gravity gradient as steep as that round a gas giant.Could their portals be as near to the planet as a close orbit moon?And Nasqueron?he asked.Would it be a typical sort of Dweller planet in this regard?All Places of Dwelling are special.Nasqueron  Nest of Winds  no less special than any.But yes.Yes.Fassin felt that if hed been standing up in normal gravity asking these questions and getting these answers, hed have had to sit down some time ago.Or just plain fallen over.Have you ever been here before, to Aopoleyin?he asked.Silence.Then, No.Or if yes, cant remember.Fassin got something like Swim, that feeling of intense disconnection when the sheer implicatory outlandishness of a situation suddenly hit home to the unprepared human.And if  when  we go back to Nasqueron, am I free to just tell people where Ive been?If you remember.Then yes.Is there a reason I might not remember?Cannula travel plays strange tricks, Seer Taak.Youd try to remove the memory from my brain?Fassin felt his skin crawl.Human brains are difficult to do that sort of thing to without harming them.Weve heard.Working on assumption nobody will believe you.Dont distress.Might believe me!Ysul said, suddenly turning away from the screens hed busied himself with earlier.Quercer Janath bobbed dramatically, like theyd forgotten he was there.Youre not serious!Not serious!they yelped, nearly together.Ysul snorted and flashed high amusement.Course not.He turned back to the screens, muttering while chuckling, What you take me for.Like life too much anyway.Hang on to my memories, thank you    * * *  The search went on.Fassin tried interrogating the Velpins systems to discover if it carried its own Dweller List, its own map of the unknown wormhole network, or even just the location of the portal theyd entered in Ulubis system to get here.The ships computers  easily accessed, barely shielded  seemed completely free of anything but the most basic star charts.The greater galaxy was mapped down to a scale that showed where all the stars and major planets should be, and that was it.No habs and no traces of megastructures were shown, and only the vaguest indications of Oort and Kuiper bodies and asteroid belts were given.It wasnt like a proper star chart set at all, it was more like a school atlas.The little gascraft had a more detailed star map.Fassin searched the ship electronically as best he could without making it too obvious, but found nothing else more detailed.He supposed the real stuff must be hidden away somewhere, but had an odd, nagging feeling that it wasnt.The Velpin seemed a well built ship  by Dweller standards exceptionally well built  with relatively sophisticated but elegantly simple engines and lots of power, no weapons and some carrying capacity.No more.The rudimentary star data somehow fitted.Fassin tried to work out a way to commandeer the ship, just take it over.Could he hijack the Velpin?Hed spent enough time in the cluttered sphere of the ships command space to see how Quercer Janath controlled the vessel.It didnt look difficult.He had, even, just asked.How do you navigate this thing?Point.Point?Get to the general volume and then point in the right direction.Secret is plenty of power.Delicate finessing of delta V is sign you havent really got enough power.Power is all.You can do a lot by just pointing.If youve got enough power.Though sometimes you have to sort of allow a bit for deflection.Thats a technical term.Fassin couldnt work out how to take the ship over.Dwellers could, if they were determined, go years without experiencing anything a human would recognise as sleep, and Quercer Janath claimed that they could get by without any at all, not even little slow down style snoozes.His gascraft had no weapons apart from the manipulators, he had never trained to use the arrowhead as a close combat device and anyway an Adult Dweller was bigger and probably more powerful  except in top speed  than the little gascraft.Dwellers were, anyway, generally regarded as being very hard to disable and\or kill.He remembered Taince Yarabokin talking about her close combat briefings.The basic advice when confronting a Dweller who meant you harm  if you, as a human, were in a conventional spacesuit, say  was to make sure you had a big gun.There was no known way an unarmed human, even in an armoured suit, could take on a fit young Dweller.If you didnt have a big gun, then Run Away Very Quickly was the best advice.Of all the Mercatorial species, only the Voehn were known to be able to tackle a Dweller unarmed, and even then it wasnt a foregone conclusion.Fassin supposed he could just ram Quercer Janath.Crashing the little gascraft into them nose first might knock them out or disable them, but he wasnt sure there was sufficient room to work up enough speed for such a manoeuvre in any single part of the ship.Hed need to start a few compartments back and come slamming into the command space, hoping for a lucky hit, and that they wouldnt hear him coming and just rote out of the way to leave him to smash into the instruments.He wondered what Hatherence would have done.He wondered if shed have been allowed to come in the first place.Almost certainly not with any weapons.On the other hand there was that standard Dweller casualness about such things.On the other hand, this ship didnt seem that casual.Even if he could get Quercer Janath out of the way, what about Ysul?He didnt think the older Dweller would conspire or even cooperate.Ysul had made it very clear that he was an entirely loyal Dweller who was simply being a good guide and mentor, not some treacherous human lover in league with or harbouring any sympathy for the Mercatoria, an entire power structure and civilisation he professed neither to understand nor care about.And even if Fassin could somehow get control of the ship by himself, tricking both Dwellers  or all three, depending how you looked at it  what then?He still hadnt been able to find any sign of a hidden navigational matrix on the ship.Where was he supposed to go?How did he find the wormhole portal that had brought them here?When he found it, how did he get through, assuming it was in any way guarded or just administered?Mercatorial portals were some of the most intensely monitored and heavily guarded locations in the galaxy.Even allowing for the semi chaotic indifference that Dwellers tended to display regarding such matters, could he really expect to fly unchallenged through one of their portals as though it was just another patch of space?Hed tried to find out more about the whole process of finding and traversing a Dweller wormhole portal  an Adjutage  from Quercer Janath, but they had, to even his surprise, given their conspicuous gift for the technique, comprehensively out vagued themselves on the matter, surpassing their most studiedly unhelpful earlier replies by some margin.Fassin had been allowed out of the ship.Hed floated free of it as it cruised gently through the tenuous, near vacuum body of the Clouder Hoestruem.He wanted to check as best he could that this was not all faked somehow.How, after all, did he really know that he was where Quercer Janath said he was?Theyd told him.Hed seen information displayed on some screen and in or out of some holo displays.It could all be a joke, or a way of setting him up for something.So he had to check.Outside the Velpin, keeping pace with the ship as it slid through the allegedly self aware interstellar cloud, he used the little gascrafts senses to gauge whether he was in some vast artificial environment.As far as Fassin could tell, he wasnt.He genuinely was in a chemical\dust cloud on the edge of a planetary system a quarter of the way round the galaxy from his home and halfway in towards the galactic core.The stars looked completely different.Only the distant galaxies still aligned.If it wasnt really the edge of deep space, it was a brilliant simulation of it.He used up a little of his reaction mass  water, basically  to fly a few kilometres away from the Velpin, and still encountered no wall, no giant screen.So either he was in a truly prodigious VR space, or it was all being done directly, through his brain, or through the gascrafts own collar, somehow uprated to one hundred per cent immersion, beyond check.He thought back to something Valseir had said once: Any theory which causes solipsism to seem just as likely an explanation for the phenomena it seeks to describe ought to be held in the utmost suspicion.Valseir had been talking about the Truth and other religions, but Fassin felt he was in a similar situation here.He had no real choice but to act as though all this was genuine.Even so, he had to keep the idea that it wasnt at the back of his head, just in case.Because if all this was real then he was, maybe, on the brink of the most astounding discovery in all human history, a revelation that could do untold harm or bring inestimable benefits to any combination of the Mercatoria, its adversaries and just about every other space faring species in the galaxy.He remembered confronting the emissarial projection, what seemed like an age ago, back in the Autumn House.Which was more likely: what appeared to be the case, or this all being a lie, a setup, a vast and incomprehensible joke?Discuss.He ran every check he could while he was outside the hull of the Velpin.He was in space.Everything checked out.Or he was in a sim so complete that there was no disgrace in being taken in by it.Back to the Truth again.Hatherence would have appreciated the dilemma.He could, if he really wanted, he supposed, just try and run away.The gascraft would support him indefinitely, it was capable of independent entry into a planetary atmosphere, and if he used almost all his reaction mass he could be in the inner system of this star Aopoleyin in a few years.He could even sleep most of the way and hardly notice the journey.But then what?Hed never heard of the place.It was somewhere in the Khredeil Tops (whatever those were) according to the gascrafts rudimentary star atlas, but it wasnt listed as a human or Mercatorial inhabited system and there was no mention of it having any inhabitants at all.That didnt mean there was nobody there  everywhere seemed to support somebody who called it home  but it meant that hed probably be no further forward trying to get back home.He came back to the ship when Quercer Janath signalled excitedly that theyd found something.It wasnt Leisicrofes ship; it was the delicate ball of gas and chemicals  a lacework ball of cold and dirty string open to the vacuum, held together by just a trace of gravity  that was the Clouders mind.Looking for ?A Dweller.A gas giant Dweller, called Leisicrofe.Image   Image?Told image expect specific image  Ah.I have an image with me.How ?Where, I mean what do I show it to, so you can see it?No describe  Okay.Its an image of white clouds in a blue sky.Accords  So you can tell me?Where Leisicrofe is?Went   When did he go?Measure time how you ?Standard system?Known being Leisicrofe went 7.35 x 10 seconds ago  Fassin did the calculation.About twenty years earlier.He was nestled into the outer regions of the Clouders mind, the little gascraft resting gently between two broad strands of gas a fraction less cold than the surrounding chill of deep space.He was, in effect, delving, stopped right down to talk to something that made a deep, slow timing Dweller look like a speed freak.Clouders thought surpassingly slowly.A signal from outside, from the Velpin.To the Clouder he sent,  Where did Leisicrofe go?Then he clicked up to normal speed.Are you going to be much longer?Ysul asked, sounding irritable.I am rapidly running out of patience with this bilateral monomaniac.Its been ten days, Fassin.Whats happened?Fallen asleep?Im going as fast as I can.Only been a few tens of seconds for me.You could just stay and think at normal speed, you know.Give us all time to mull over whatever this gas brains saying.No need to go doing this show off delving stuff.Less of a conversation that way.This shows respect.You get more out of people if you  Yes yes yes.Well, you just carry on.Ill try and find more games to keep this split personality cretin occupied.You rote off and commune with this space vegetable.Ill do the real hard work.Sorry I came along now.If Ive missed any more good battles while Ive been away His voice faded into the distance.Fassin descended into extreme slow time again.The Clouder still hadnt replied.At least this time there was no insane spiralling.There was the same fuzzy, low reliability screen to distract them as they wafted away from the Clouder and made for the hidden wormhole mouth, and the doors out of the passenger compartment were just as locked, but there was no fierce spinning.Fassin let Quercer Janath take over the gascraft remotely and turn off its systems.He didnt bother to clear any of the shock gel or turn the faceplate clear this time, he just put himself into a trance.It was easy, a lot like preparing to go down into slow time.And it meant he couldnt see or hear Ysul complaining about the ignominy of being zapped unconscious just because they were going on a space journey.They were making for somewhere called Mavirouelo  yet another place Fassin had never heard of.This was where Hoestruem had said that Leisicrofe was going next.The Clouder hadnt known if this was a system, a planet, another Clouder or what.Quercer Janath had gone silent for a moment when they heard the name, and Fassin had sensed them consulting the ships crude galactic atlas.They declared that they knew the place.A planet, in the Ashum system.(Fassin, or at least the gascrafts memory, did know of this place.It was even connected, with its own Mercatorial controlled wormhole, though Fassin suspected they wouldnt be using it. )Total travel time to be expected was a few days.As he slid into unconsciousness, Fassins thoughts were of how beautiful the Clouder had looked.The vast being was like a million great long gauzy scarves of light, a whisper of matter and gravity close to nothingness that massed more than many solar systems, drifting yet purposeful, intent by ancient decision, along a course charted out over millions of years, propelled, dirigible by minute flexings of cold plasmas, by the force of near not there at all magnetic fields, by sigh strength expulsions and drawings in of interstellar material.Cold and dead seeming yet alive and thinking.And beautiful, in the right light.Seen in a fitting wash of wavelengths, there was something endlessly, perfectly sublime about    * * *  Saluus stood on a balcony of ice and metal, looking out at the view, his breath misting in the air before him.The Shrievalty retreat was embedded in and partially sculpted from the frozen waterfall Hoisennir, a four hundred metre high, klick wide cliff of ice marking where the river Doaroe began its long fall from the high semi arctic plateau towards the tundra and plains beyond.A low winter sun provided a grand display of Sepektian clouds and a fuzzy purple red sunset, but nowhere near enough heat to start melting the ice.Sepekte wobbled slowly and not especially significantly.Its arctic and antarctic circles, where the sun alternately never set or never rose during the heights of summer and depths of winter, were less than a thousand kilometres in diameter.Officially classed as a hot\temperate planet by human standards, its winters were longer but less severe than those of Earth and their worst effects were confined to smaller areas than on humanitys original home.But the Hoisennir waterfall was far north and high up in the arctic shield mountains, and the Doaroe spent standard years at a time entirely frozen.The place was called a retreat because it was owned by the Shrievalty, but as far as Saluus was concerned it was just a hotel and conference centre.The view was impressive, though, when there was sufficient daylight actually to see it properly.It had a certain severe appeal, Saluus was prepared to grant.Saluus didnt like being here, all the same.He wasnt keen on places that he couldnt get away from easily  preferably, if the worst came to the worst, by just walking.To get away from here meant an air car or a lift up or down the interior of the frozen fall to the landing ground on the ice of the solidified river above, or down to the vac rail station on the shore of the frozen lake at the foot of the cliff.When hed found out where the conference on the Dweller Embassy was to be held  at fairly short notice, for security reasons  hed made sure to have a parasail packed with his luggage, just so that he had an emergency way out, if it came to it.He knew that almost certainly there wouldnt be any emergency  or if there was it would be something so big and or quick that there would be no getting away from it  but he felt better, safer having the parasail by the balcony window of his bedroom.Most of the other important attendees had suites far inside the fall, to be further away from anything that might come at them from outside, but Saluus had insisted on an outside suite, one with a view, a way out.He hadnt parasailed for decades but hed rather risk his neck that way than cowering at the back of a suite, whimpering, just waiting for death.He sometimes wondered where this obsession with being able to get away came from.It wasnt something hed been born with or picked up as the result of some traumatic experience in childhood, it was just something that had sort of crept slowly up on him all the way through his adult life.One of those things, he supposed.He hadnt bothered wasting any time thinking really deeply about it.All that mattered, Saluus supposed, was that the retreat\hotel was as safe a place to be as anywhere was, these days.The attacks on Ulubis system had gone on, never slackening off for very long, never really reaching any sort of peak.Many of the targets were obvious military ones, often attacked with bombs, missiles and relatively short range weapons.These were usually blamed on the Beyonders.Other targets had cultural or morale value or were just big.These were the kind that were hit from deep space, with high velocity, sometimes near light speed boosted rocks.The number of such attacks had increased even as the weight of assaults by drone craft carrying beam weapons and missiles had decreased.Some of the strategists claimed that all this represented a failure by their enemies to attack when theyd expected to, though it seemed to Saluus that what they called the proof of this relied too much on simulations and shared assumptions.It had all certainly gone on for a long time now.People had worked their way through the various stages of shock, denial, defiance, solidarity, grim determination and who knew what else; nowadays they were just tired of it.They wanted it all to end.They feared how that end might come about, but they were half broken by the erratic bombardment and the ever present uncertainty.Worse  in a way, because news had somehow leaked out of when the invasion by the Starveling Cult had been expected, and it had not yet materialised  people were starting to think that it might not now ever happen.The real conspiracy theorists believed that it had all been a huge military industrial paranoid death fantasy right from the start, that no real threat had ever existed, that most of the attacks were being carried out by the security forces themselves, either as part of an inter service conflict or in a carefully planned series of cynical, deliberately self sacrificial moves that would gain sympathy for the armed forces even as the mass of people lost the few remaining civil liberties they still had; that it was all just an excuse to turn the whole Ulubis system into a semi fascist society, securing power in the hands of the privileged few.Even those of a more moderate turn of mind chafed at the freedoms lost and the restrictions imposed, and had begun asking where exactly was this terrible threat they had been preparing for for the best part of a year?Shouldnt the sky have lit up by now with the invading fleets drives as they decelerated into Ulubis near space?People were starting to question the need for all the sacrifice and hardship and to wonder if too much was being done to counter a threat that so far hadnt materialised and not enough to deal with the ongoing attrition of small scale but still intermittently devastating attacks.The strategists were wondering where the E 5 Discon forces were, too.There had been wild arguments over what the best strategy was: go out to meet the invading fleet or fleets, hoping to gain a slight edge by a degree of surprise  and keeping at least some of the fighting out of the populated reaches of Ulubis system  or sit tight and wait, building up maximum forces where they were in the end most needed?Drone scout ships had already been dispatched in the general direction the invasion was coming from but so far none of them had found anything.A very literal long shot.A giant magnetic rail gun was being constructed in orbit round Giri, the smaller gas giant beyond Nasqueron, built to scatter space in front of the oncoming fleet with debris: a huge blunderbuss supposed to throw a sleet of surveillance machines and a cloud of tiny guided explosive or just kinetic mines before the invading ships, but it was only now getting up to speed, months late, wildly over budget and plagued by problems.At least this latest failure couldnt be laid at the door of Kehar Heavy Industries.Saluuss firm had never been involved in the contract.Theyd been the obvious people to build it but it had been handed over to a consortium of other companies partly just to show that KHI didnt have a monopoly and to give some of the others a shot at a big project.The interim report on the Nasqueron debacle had pretty much cleared KHI, finding nothing worse than occasionally imprecise accounting, the sort of rush resulted corner cutting that was only to be expected in anything like the current emergency.The whole storm battle farce had been a home grown military fuck up in other words, just as Saluus had maintained from the start.Partly as a result, he had become more integrated into the whole planning and strategic superstructure of the Ulubine Mercatoria and even, fairly regularly, the Emergency War Cabinet.This made sense.It also appealed to Saluuss sense of importance, and he was self aware enough to know and accept this.And, of course, it had the additional effect of tying him in tighter to the political hierarchy of the system, identifying him even more strongly with the ruling structures and individuals, giving him more of an incentive to fight to preserve Mercatorial rule.If the bad guys did sweep in and take things over it would be harder now for Saluus to wave his hands and claim to be just a modest shipbuilder, now humbly at the service of the new masters.Still, proximity, access and even a degree of control over such power was something Saluus felt comfortable with and, if the worst did happen, he still wasnt as symbolically part of the old regime as the others in the War Cabinet, and his control of KHI would make him valuable to whoever ran the system.Hed play it by ear.Besides, he had an escape route mapped out.The longer the E 5 Discon invasion took to happen, the shorter would be the time to wait for the Mercatoria counter attack, in which case he might be better off just disappearing while the bad guys settled in and prepared their own defences.(In theory they were supposed to be kept in the dark that the Mercatorial fleet was on its way, but news of that had leaked too and anyway their Beyonder allies would surely have told them. )If it was simpler to hide then Saluus would hide.Hed try to get involved in some guerrilla activity, too, hopefully at a safe remove, so that when the Mercatoria did retake the system he would look like some sort of hero rather than a coward only interested in his own wealth.But keeping out of the way was sometimes the best strategy when things got messy.He had a very fast ship indeed being built in one of the secret yards, a prototype that he fully intended to make sure was never quite ready for active service or even military trial runs.It would be his way out, if he needed it.In all this, amazingly, the woman he had first known as Ko, when shed been with Fassin Taak  her real name, the name she used now, was Liss Alentiore  had been a real help.Hed fallen for her, he supposed.In fact, hed fallen for her to the extent that his wife  despite her own happily indulged and numerous dalliances  had, for the first and only time, shown signs of jealousy.(Liss herself had suggested a way out of this, though it had occurred, at least as a fantasy, to him as well.So now they had a very stimulating little menage a trois going. )More to the point, Liss had proved a trustworthy confidante and reliable source of advice.There had been a few occasions over the last few crowded, sometimes desperate months when Salluus had not known which way to react and hed talked it over with her, either in the semi formality of his office, flier or ship or from pillow to pillow, and shed known what to do, if not immediately then after a night or twos thought.She was canny in a sidelong, catlike way; she knew how people worked, how they thought, which way they would jump, almost tele pathically sometimes.Hed invented a post for Liss in his entourage and made her his personal private secretary.His social and business secretaries had both been quietly piqued, but were smart enough to accept the new face with a degree of feigned generosity and seemingly genuine grace, and without trying to do anything to undermine her.Saluus had a feeling that they had each anyway gauged Liss accurately, and realised that any attack they might try on her would likely rebound on themselves.His own security people had been suspicious of her at first, finding all sorts of insalubrious stuff hinted at in her past, and then a sort of suspicious fuzziness.But ultimately there had been nothing damning, certainly nothing that was worse than what hed got up to when he was her age.Shed been young, wild and shed mixed with dubious types.So had he.So what?Hed quizzed her gently on her past himself and got an impression of hurt and trauma and bad memories.He didnt want to hurt her further by inquiring too deeply.It added to his feeling that, in some almost unbearably gallant way, hed rescued her.Shed been a middling journalist with a technical journal with a past in dance, acting, hostessing and massage work before; hed taken her away from all that.Shed looked much younger than she was when hed met her that night with Fassin  Saluus was a big fan of that whole wise head on young shoulders thing now, hed decided  but she looked even better now, having taken him up on the offer of treatments she could never have had access to until theyd met.She was grateful to him.She never said so straight out  that would have imbalanced too much what they had  but he could see it in her eyes sometimes.Well, he was grateful to her, too.Shed revitalised his private life and proved a significant new asset in his public one.There was, also, just a hint of a feeling that hed taken her away from Fassin, and that was quite a pleasant little sensation all by itself.Saluus had never exactly envied the other man  he didnt really envy anybody, indeed why should he, how could he?but there was a sort of ease to Fassins life that Saluus had always coveted, and so resented.To be part of a big family group like that, surrounded by people all doing the same steady thing, respected for their work intrinsically without constantly having to prove themselves through tender processes and balance sheets and shareholders meetings and staff councils that must have its own sweetness, that must give a sort of academic security, a feeling of justification.And then the fellow had gone and become some sort of hero figure, just by spending five years pickled in shock gel in a miniature gascraft (not even built by KHI) knocking round with a bunch of degenerate Dwellers.Had that fame attracted Liss to Fassin?Had she just traded Fassin in, traded up to Saluus because the opportunity had presented itself?Maybe so.It didnt bother him.Relationships were a market, Sal knew that.Only children and idiot romantics thought otherwise.You judged your own attractiveness  physically, psychologically and in terms of status  then you knew your level and could either raise or lower your sights accordingly, risking rejection but with the possibility of advancement, or settling for a more reliably stable life but never knowing what you might have achieved.Saluus took a deep, cold breath.The sun had disappeared, Ulubis dipping beneath tree coated mountains far to the south west.A few stars started to come out in the darkening purple sky.The broad scatter of orbital habs and factories shone like a handful of thrown, sparkling dust to the south east, gradually stretching out across the sky after the retreating sunset like a distillation of the fading light.Saluus wondered which of those tiny scintillations belonged to him.Not as many as a year ago.Some had been moved away, just to get them out of old orbits where they could be more easily targeted.Two  big dock ships, both of them, and cradling Navarchy vessels at the time  had been destroyed.Wreckage from one had fallen on Fessli City, killing tens of thousands, many more than had died in the initial attack.KHI was being sued for negligence, accused of not moving the dock ships out of the way in time.A war on and everything controlled by the military but there was still room for that sort of shit.He was having words in appropriate ears, to get a blanket War Exemption Order proclaimed.Saluus looked through his own exhaled breath for Nasqueron, but it was far below the horizon and probably all but invisible behind the shield of orbital scatter anyway, even if he had been in the right latitudes to see it.Fassin.In all the preparations for war and invasion, you always had to make time to take account of whatever he might have got up to.Had he died in the storm battle?Reports from Nasqueron were ambiguous.But then reports from Nasqueron were never anything but ambiguous.Hed certainly disappeared, and was probably still on Nasqueron  though in the time between the destruction of the original satellite surveillance network round the planet at the time of the storm battle and the establishment of a new one after the founding of the Dweller Embassy, there had been a window when even quite big craft might have left Nasquerons atmosphere  but who knew?And if Taak was still somewhere in the gas giant, what was he doing?If he was still alive, Saluus didnt envy him at all any more.To have your whole existence, never mind your whole family, wiped out like that maybe Fassin had killed himself.He had been told, apparently, before the whole ghastly mess at the GasClipper race.He knew they were dead.If he wasnt dead too, he was more alone than hed ever been in his life, with nothing much to come back to.Saluus felt sorry for him.His first thought had been that with Fassin so reduced, there would be no danger of Liss going back to him if he ever did reappear.But then hed thought about how people could confound your expectations sometimes, and how women in particular could display a sort of theoretically laudable but harmfully self sacrificial kind of misplaced charity when they saw somebody damaged.Luckily Jaal Tonderon was still alive.Sal and his wife had invited her to stay with them for a while.He wanted to encourage her to be strong for Fassin, if he ever did make it back, and they were all still there.The Dweller Embassy had been a great success.The Dwellers had seemed keen to make up for the misunderstanding in the storm and the Ulubis Mercatoria had been desperate not to fight on two hopeless fronts at once.Another moon, Uerkle, had been designated as the new site for the Seers Shared facility  construction was well under way  and a small fleet of ships had been welcomed into orbit around the gas giant.Seers had started direct delving again  the equipment for remote delving was not yet all in place  and the Dwellers either didnt notice or didnt care that a lot of new so called Seers were really Navarchy, Cessoria and Shrievalty scouts  spies, if you wanted to be blunt about it  searching for Fassin Taak, searching for the also disappeared Dweller called Valseir, searching for any sign of those weapons used against the Mercatorial forces during the battle in the GasClipper storm race and searching too for any hints or traces of the Dweller List and anything remotely associated with it  so far, admittedly, all completely without success.Even these scout craft had to be tagged and traceable and escorted by a Dweller guide, but it was a start.Also in the preparatory  and to date unsuccessful  stages were the negotiations with the Dwellers to forge an alliance or get Mercatorial hands on Dweller weaponry.The Dwellers had shown themselves to possess offensive capabilities  well, strictly speaking, defensive capabilities, but that didnt matter  nobody had credited them with.If they could be brought into an alliance with the rest of Ulubis system, the whole balance of forces between the invaders and the defenders might be turned upside down.Even if the Dwellers only shared some of their military technological know how  or just lent out or hired some of the devices  that might make enough of a difference for Ulubis to resist the invasion on its own without having to wait for the Summed Fleet units to arrive.And if that failed, then there was the delicate matter of how to get the Starveling invasion fleet to attack Nasqueron and so, with luck, dash itself to pieces against whatever hyper weaponry had destroyed the Navarchy forces in the storm battle.So much to think about.Saluus was wearing a jacket but hed come out without gloves and so had put his hands into his pockets to keep them warm.Liss slipped one arm through his, suddenly there at his side, nuzzled up to him, her skin perfume seeming to fill his head.He looked down at her and she pressed closer to him, following his gaze out to the south and the stipple of light from the orbital structures.He felt her shiver.She was dressed in light clothes.He took off his jacket and put it over her shoulders.Hed seen that in screen stories and it still made him feel good to do it.He didnt mind the cold, though it was worse than it had been, and a breeze was starting to blow from above.It was a part katabatic wind, hed been told by somebody: a current of cold air flowing down from the ice locked wastes above, displacing warmer, less dense air below and driving gently but firmly downwards, spilling over the lip of the waterfall like a ghost of the frozen, plunging waters.They stood in silence for a while, then Liss reminded Saluus that he was supposed to meet with Peregal Emoerte for a private talk before dinner that evening.There was still time, though.He felt cold now, close to shivering.He would wait until he did shiver before he went in.He stared up into the near complete darkness directly overhead, watching the spark of a close orbit satellite pass above them.He felt Liss stiffen at his side, and pulled her closer.Whats that?she said after a few more moments.He looked where she was pointing, to the low west, where only the vaguest, dimmest hint of purple near the horizon showed where Ulubis had set.A little above that horizon, in the sky below, beyond and above the thickest strands of reflected orbital light, new lights were flickering to life.They were a sprinkle of bright blue, scattered across a rough circle of sky the size of a large coin held at arms length, and increasing in number with every passing second.The blue points wavered, gradually strengthening.More and more were lighting up, filling the little window of sky with a blue blaze of cold fire, barely twinkling in the chill, still air out over the frozen plains.Saluus felt himself shiver, though not from the cold.He opened his mouth to speak but Liss looked up at him and said,  Thats them, isnt it?Thats the Starveling Cult guys, the E 5 Discon.Thats the invasion fleet, braking.Fraid so, Sal agreed.His ear stud was pinging and the comms in the suite was warbling plaintively.Wed better go in.* * *  Groggy again.Still in the passenger\freight compartment of the Velpin.He brought the little gascrafts systems back up.The wall screen crazed, came clear, showed stars fixed, then swinging, and finally settled on a greeny blue and white planet.Fassins first reaction on seeing it was that the place looked alien, unsuitable for life without an esuit.Then he realised that it looked like glantine or Sepekte; like images of Earth, in fact.Going gas giant native, he told himself.Thinking like a Dweller.It didnt usually happen so quickly.Oh, fuck!Ysul said angrily, staring at the image on the screen.Its not even a proper fucking planet!The waves came booming in like blindness, like stubbornness bundled and given liquid form, an unending slow launching against the ragged fringe of massively sprawled rocks, each long, low rough ridge of water heaving skywards to tumble like some ponderously incompetent somersaulter, rolling up and falling forward, hopeful and hopeless at once, disintegrating, exploding in spray and foam, coming to pieces amongst the fractured bone yard of rock.The waters drained after each assault, rattling boulders, stones and pebbles between the massive jabs and points of granite, sloughing like a watery skin and falling away again, that stony chattering speaking of a slowly aggregated success, the waves  the ocean  rubbing away at the land, breaking up and breaking away, using rock against rock, tumbling it and crashing it and cracking it, abrading over centuries and millennia to a kind of stubborn accomplishment.He watched the waves for some time, admiring their vast mad pounding, reluctantly impressed by such sheer clamorous inces sancy.The salt spray filled his hair and eyes and nose and lungs.He breathed in deeply, feeling joined, feeling linked to and part of this wild, unceasing elemental battle.A low, golden light struck out across the ruffled nap of sea, sunlight swinging slow beneath a great piled series of cloud escarpments to the west, layers of vapour draped over distant peaks and spires of rock disappearing into the long misted curve of north facing shore.Seabirds wheeled across the wind and waves, diving, flapping away, clutching slim fish like wet slices of rainbow.It had felt strange, at first, coming out of the little gascraft.It always did, it always had, but this time seemed different, more intense somehow.This was an alien homeland, a familiar yet utterly different place; closer to what ought to be home, further from what was.Eleven thousand light years away from Ulubis this time, though they had travelled further than the last time to get here.And just twelve days travel.When hed opened the gascrafts hatch and stood, hed staggered and swayed, needed holding up by Ysul.Hed coughed and nearly retched, feeling scrawny and weak and thin and hollowed out, shivering in the strange ultra nakedness of returning to the basic human condition, as slimed and wet and naked as a newborn, and even the retreating tendrils of the gill fluid and shock gel tubes there too, umbilical links to image birth.He felt lighter and heavier at once, blood draining, bones complaining.Then, after a while, being naked  even naked in ordinary clothes  started to feel normal again.Every now and again, though, he shivered.The Velpins pattern follower had done its best to make human wearable clothes, but still the results felt strange and slick and cold.They were on Mavirouelo, a ninety per cent Earthlike not far from the galactic outskirts, though less isolated than Ulubis.A Waterworlder colonised planet, a Sceuri world.Waterworlds were the single most common type of rocky planet in the galaxy, even though you never saw the rock, which was, on average, a metal rock core about the size of Earth buried under five thousand kilometres of pressure ice, finally topped by a hundred klicks of ocean.Such planets provided the next most common planetary environments after the near ubiquitous gas giants themselves, and had given the Mercatoria three of its eight principal species: the Sceuri, the Ifrahile and the Kuskunde.Mavirouelo was not a classic waterworld  it wasnt even as water covered as Earth itself  but it had been colonised by the Sceuri before any native animal  of air, land or sea  had developed sufficiently to claim it as their own, and so had become one of the Sceuri far worlds, an outpost of their own semimperia within the greater commonwealth of the Mercatoria.The Sceuri werent conventional waterworlders, either.They were Cetasails, resembling sea mammals but with backs ridged by spinnaker spines which they could hoist to the wind and so sail as well as swim across their worlds.Ysul, in his esuit, rose out of the sea like a submarine conning tower, frightening the seabirds.He floated up and out and made his way across the turmoil of waves to the low cliff where Fassin stood.The human was suddenly reminded of the time he had stood with Saluus Kehar, watching Hatherence, in her esuit, float out across the chaos of artificial surf surrounding the waterspout house.Fassin!Ysul boomed, floating, dripping and humming, in the air ten metres above him.No sign yet?No sign yet.Ysul held up a mesh basket of glistening, flapping, wriggling stuff.Look what I caught!He brought the basket in front of his forward mantle to look at it.Think Ill take it back to the ship.Ysul flew over Fassin, dropping water and small shells on top of him, then headed inland a couple of hundred metres to the ship section resting on the scrubby ledge of vegetation fringing the jagged ranks of cliffs, pinnacles and mountains beyond.The fifty metre long lander made up the nose section of the Velpin, the rest of which, with Quercer Janath aboard, was still in orbit.Fassin watched the Dweller go, then turned back to the ocean.He was here to meet with a Sceuri who had seen the Dweller Leisicrofe, who had been here until, theyd been told, twelve years ago.They hadnt met a Sceuri yet.The Velpin had been challenged by the planets orbital traffic control and targeted by several military units and so had had to reveal something of its reasons for being there.Looking for some Dweller geezer called Leisicrofe, had been Quercer Janaths exact words.Theyd been told to go into orbit and stay there.Targeting beams never left them.They were regarded as suspicious because their ship looked hole capable and they hadnt come through the local portal.Sceuri, Quercer Janath had told Fassin and Ysul.Suspicious.Paranoid.Theyd spent three days watching the planet revolve beneath them.Ysul had muttered about how flat and boring the storms looked, Fassin had found endless fascination in the great snowflake city structures spread across water and land, and the truetwin passed the time inventorying ship stuff theyd forgotten about and playing noisy image leaf games.They answered questions from planetary traffic control about where theyd come from  Nhouaste, the largest of the systems four gas giant planets, was the answer given  and then a signal had come through.A scholar named Aumapile of Aumapile had had the honour of playing host to the Dweller scholar Leisicrofe and would be flattered to be allowed to extend the same courtesies to these new arrivals.Another step along the way, another step closer, perhaps, to finding the wandering Dweller and the data he carried.If he still lived, if he still had the data, if the data was what it was supposed to be, if Valseir had been telling the truth, if it was not all utterly out of date, without point, overtaken by the seeming certainty that there was a network of secret wormholes accessible only to Dwellers, but they werent sharing it and it might have nothing to do with the Dweller List.Fassin was looking for something that might lead him to what he had already used, twice.He had already been through at least two wormholes, travelled across half the galaxy, and yet he wasnt really any closer to finding the key to this system of trapdoors and secret passages.He could be carried unconscious through them like a fey maiden under the influence of a sleeping draught in some Gothic romance, but he wasnt allowed to know the secret behind it all.He was still trying to think of ways to commandeer the Velpin, but with no real hope of success.There would still be the problem of accessing the hidden wormholes.Just thinking of a way to stay awake while they made these wild transitions would be a start, but he had no idea how to do that either.If he could go back in time to Apsile and the Shared Facility in Third Fury and ask him to build some subset of systems into the gascraft that would keep working when the main ones were shut down, making it look like the machine had entirely stopped functioning when in fact he was still sense connected and aware, maybe it would be possible.But even the Dwellers didnt claim to have time machines, and Fassin didnt have the expertise to undertake such an amendment to the gascrafts systems himself, even if he had had the time and the facilities to do it, neither of which he did have.Maybe he should have gone back to the Mercatoria, acted as a real major in the Ocula would have done and retreated, reported to his superiors, told them what had happened and awaited new or renewed orders.But the Ocula meant nothing to him and never had, and most of what had mattered before to him was also gone now.He might even have tried to get in touch with the Beyonders, but until he had the key to the Dweller List, what was the point in that?And anyway  what if they had been behind the Septs destruction, even at a remove?Just how magnanimous was he prepared to be?What point, indeed, was there in going back at all, perhaps.Seventy days standard had elapsed since Fassin had first gone tumbling into the atmosphere of Nasqueron.It was over two old Earth months since the battle in the storm.Who knew how much longer hed have to keep looking for Leisicrofe, chasing him round the galaxy, perhaps ever coming closer to him, maybe never quite catching up with him?Maybe hed get his precious data and return to find it was all over, the system taken, or utterly laid waste to, every surface like the surface of Third Fury, just slag and heat, destroyed by one side or another or by both, fighting for something that wasnt even there any more.It should still, in theory, be the most important piece of information that a human had ever carried.But somehow, even if the key to the Dweller List did exist, the fact that Dwellers could use this secret network under the noses of the rest of the galaxy  and had been so doing for who alone knew how many billions of years  made it seem much less likely that any scrap of data, any proof size patch of algebra was going to make that much of a difference.And yet, still, despite everything, all he could do, all that he could even think of doing, was to press on and try to find what everybody wanted him to find, and hope that it might do some good somehow.Fassin breathed in, tasting salt.He no longer doubted that this was real, or a virtual environment there was no disgrace in being fooled by.There wasnt even anywhere like this  this coarse, storm sundered coast  anywhere in Ulubis system.And the stars were completely different, again.Something caught Fassins attention.A few kilometres out into the ocean, the water was rising in a great shallow dome, flowing everywhere down from a huge flattened hemisphere of foam streaked darkness rising like a never breaking explosion from the depths, still spreading and still rising and causing a great slow swell of disturbed waves to come pulsing forward, towards the cliffs as the apparition  a double saucer shape two kilometres wide  finally broke free of the sea entirely and came slowly towards the shore, sheets and veils of salt rain falling from beneath it, flattening the shadow bruised surface of the waters.Ysul floated up, nodding forward.Rides here, then.They floated, stood and hovered in a half drained crystal hall within the great saucer ship.Aumapile of Aumapile floated in the water, a fat eel the size of an orca with a great folded fan of sail ridging its back.Fassin stood on a broad ledge, still slick with salty water, while Ysul and the truetwin Quercer Janath  cajoled down eventually, bulked out with a twin skin overall of extreme shininess that doubled as an esuit  hovered in the air above the great pool of water.Fassin found himself thinking about the Autumn House again, and Slovius in his pool.Aumapile of Aumapile  The Aumapile of Aumapile, apparently, according to the servant who had escorted them down a broad water filled tube to the audience chamber, the human and the Dwellers in a bubble of air enclosed by a sphere of diamond  was not merely a justly famous scholar of the Cincturia, it was a vastly rich justly famous scholar of the Cincturia.A high, warbling, seemingly interminable song sounded from an underwater sound system.A Song of Welcoming For Those From Afar, apparently.Song for making you want to go straight back there again, Ysul had asided to Fassin, as theyd accepted reasonable impersonations of something to drink and\or inhale.They talked of Leisicrofe.Their host, speaking through a small hovering speaker sphere, said they had missed him by some years and then Ysul mentioned following him.Oh, the Sceuri said, but you must take me with you.Must?Must?But I know where he went, the Sceuri said, as though this explained everything.Couldnt you just tell us?Ysul asked plaintively.Just point us in the right direction.And well be on our way  The Sceuri wriggled in the great pool, sending water sloshing.It laughed.A soft, tinkling sound from the hovering speaker.Oh, I could, but I always had the feeling my friend Leisicrofe had travelled even more widely than I have, especially into the gases of Nhouaste.I think you may be heading there, as you did not come through the wormhole portal, and he did not depart through it.You see?I have my sources.I know what goes on.You cant fool me.I am not so stupid.You and your little Squanderer friend will be heading back to Nhouaste.Doubt it, the Dweller travelcaptain said, snorting.Fassin was the little Squanderer friend.The Sceuri took great pride in having become a technological, space faring species, given the obstacles theyd had to overcome.A classic water world environment had almost no easily available metals.Any metal bearing ores that a waterworld possessed tended to be locked away under all that ice, deep in the planets inaccessible rocky core.Waterworlders had to do what they could with what fell from the sky in the shape of meteorites, and in this shared a developmental background with gas giant Dwellers.To get into space in the face of such a paucity of readily available raw materials was not easy, and the Sceuri regarded themselves as deserving considerable recognition and respect for such a triumph of intellect over scarcity.Accomplishing the same feat when you came from a rock surface planet was a relatively trivial, expectable, even dismissible trick.The Sceuri called people from such planets Squanderers as a result, though not usually to their face or other appropriate feature.Please make clear, oh great A of A, the other half of Quercer Janath said.Fassin suspected that he already knew what the Sceuri was thinking.The local gas giant, Nhouaste  inhabited by Dwellers, of course  was, like the vast majority of Dweller gas giants, not a world that welcomed Seers or anybody else apart from other Dwellers.Aumapile of Aumapile had probably been told where Leisicrofe was heading next and assumed that as the Dweller had not gone through the Mercatorial wormhole  and assuming he hadnt headed into deep space at STL speeds  he must have gone to look for whatever it was he was looking for in the one place that even being fabulously rich and corruptly well connected couldnt gain you access to, in this system or any other: a Dweller inhabited gas giant.I think the Toilers our mutual friend sought have found a new niche, no longer in space, but in gas, you see?the Sceuri said.Even through the speaker sphere, the creatures voice sounded pleased with itself.Toilers?Ysul said.Known.Benign semi swarm devices, the other half of Quercer Janath announced.Infra sentient.Known for randomly building inscrutable space structures, best guess for purpose of which being as preparatory infrastructure for an invasion that never took place on behalf of a race long gone and thoroughly forgotten.Distribution very wide but very sparse.
