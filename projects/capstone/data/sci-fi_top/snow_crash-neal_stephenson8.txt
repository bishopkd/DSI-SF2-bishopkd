You make your own deal with the other passenger.After that, I never want to see you again.What if I need more consular services?I can always go out and tell people, the man says, that a nigger with swords is out raping Chinese refugees.Hmm.This isn't exactly the best service I've ever had at a Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.This is not a normal situation, the man says.Look out the window, asshole.Not much has apparently changed down at the waterfront.The Orthos have organized their defense in the lobby of the Spectrum 2000: furniture has been overturned, barricades set up.Inside the hotel itself, Hiro presumes furious activity is going on.It's still not clear whom the Orthos are defending themselves against.Making his way through the waterfront area, Hiro doesn't see much: just more Chinese Refus in baggy clothes.It's just that some of them look a lot more alert than others.They have a whole different affect.Most of the Chinese have their eyes on the mud in front of their feet, and their minds on something else.But some of them are just strolling up and down the street, looking all around, alertly, and most of these people happen to be young men wearing bulky jackets.And haircuts that are from a whole other stylistic universe than what the others are sporting.There is evidence of styling gel.The entrance to the rich people's pier is sandbagged, barbwired, and guarded.Hiro approaches slowly, his hands in plain sight, and shows his pass to the head guard, who is the only white person Hiro has seen in Port Sherman.And that gets him onto the pier.Just like that.Like the Hong Kong franchulate, it's empty, quiet, and doesn't stink.It bobs up and down gently on the tide, in a way that Hiro finds relaxing.It's really just a train of rafts, plank platforms built over floating hunks of styrofoam, and if it weren't guarded it would probably end up getting dragged out and lashed onto the Raft.Unlike a normal marina, it's not quiet and isolated.Usually, people moor their boats, lock them up, and leave.Here, at least one person is hanging out on each boat, drinking coffee, keeping their weapons in plain sight, watching Hiro very intently as he strolls up the pier.Every few seconds, the pier thunders with footsteps, and one or two Russians run past Hiro, making for the Kodiak Queen.They are all young men, all sailor/soldier types, and they're diving onto the Kodiak Queen as if it's the last boat out of Hell, being shouted at by officers, running to their stations, frantically attending to their sailor chores.Things are a lot calmer on the Kowloon.It's guarded too, but most of the people appear to be waiters and stewards, wearing snappy uniforms with brass buttons and white gloves.Uniforms that are intended to be used indoors, in pleasant, climate controlled dining rooms.A few crew members are visible from place to place, their black hair slicked back, clad in dark windbreakers to protect them from the cold and spray.Hiro can only see one man on the Kowloon who appears to be a passenger: a tall slender Caucasian in a dark suit, strolling around chatting into a portable telephone.Probably some Industry jerk who wants to go out for a day cruise, look at the Refus on the Raft while he's sitting in a dining room having a gourmet dinner.Hiro's about halfway down the pier when all hell breaks loose on shore, in front of the Spectrum 2000.It starts with a long series of heavy machine gun bursts that don't appear to do much damage, but do clear the street pretty fast.Ninety nine percent of the Refus just evaporate.The others, the young men Hiro noticed, pull interesting high tech weapons out of their jackets and disappear into doorways and buildings.Hiro picks up the pace a little, starts walking backward down the pier, trying to get some of the larger vessels in between him and the action so he doesn't get hit by a stray burst.A fresh breeze comes off the water and down the pier.Passing by the Kowloon, it picks up the smell of bacon frying and coffee brewing, and Hiro can't help but meditate on the fact that his last meal was half of a cheap beer in a Kelley's Tap in a Snooze 'n' Cruise.The scene in front of the Spectrum 2000 has devolved into a generalized roar of unbelievably loud white noise as all the people inside and outside of the hotel fire their weapons back and forth across the street.Something touches his shoulder.Hiro turns to brush it away, sees that he's looking down at a short Chinese waitress who has come down the pier from the Kowloon.Having gotten his attention, she puts her hands back where they were originally, to wit, plastered over her ears.You Hiro Protagonist?she mouths, basically inaudible over the ridiculous noise of the firefight.Hiro nods.She nods back, steps away from him, jerks her head toward the Kowloon.With her hands plastered over her ears this way, it looks like some kind of a folkdance move.Hiro follows her down the pier.Maybe they're going to let him charter the Kowloon after all.She ushers him onto the aluminum gangplank.As he's walking across it, he looks up to one of the higher decks, where a couple of the crew members are hanging out in their dark windbreakers.One of them is leaning against a railing, watching the firefight through binoculars.Another one, an older one, approaches him, leans over to examine his back, slaps him a couple of times between the shoulder blades.The guy drops his binoculars to see who's pounding him on the back.His eyes are not Chinese.The older guy says something to him, gestures at his throat.He's not Chinese, either.The binocular guy nods, reaches up with one hand and presses a lapel switch.The next time he turns around, a word is written across his back in neon green electropigment: MAFIA.The older guy turns away; his windbreaker says the same thing.Hiro turns around in the middle of the gangplank.There are twenty crew members in plain sight all around him.Suddenly, their black windbreakers all say, MAFIA.Suddenly, they are all armed.45  I was planning to get in touch with Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong and file a complaint about their proconsul here in Port Sherman, Hiro jokes.He was very uncooperative this morning when I insisted on renting this boat out from under you.Hiro is sitting in the first class dining room of the Kowloon.On the other side of the white linen tablecloth is the man Hiro had previously pegged as the Industry creep on vacation.He's impeccably dressed in a black suit, and he has a glass eye.He has not bothered to introduce himself, as though he's expecting Hiro to know who he is already.The man does not seem amused by Hiro's story.He seems, rather, nonplussed.So?Don't see any reason to file a complaint now, Hiro says.Why not?Well, because now I understand his reluctance not to displace you guys.How come?You got money, don't you?Yeah, but  Oh!the man with the glass eye says, and allows himself sort of a forced smile.Because we're the Mafia, you're saying.Yeah, Hiro says, feeling his face get hot.Nothing like making a total dickhead out of yourself.Nothing in the world like it, nosireebob.Outside, the gun battle is just a dim roar.This dining room is insulated from noise, water, wind, and hot flying lead by a double layer of remarkably thick glass, and the space between the panes is full of something cool and gelatinous.The roar does not seem as steady as it used to be.Fucking machine guns, the man says.I hate 'em.Maybe one out of a thousand rounds actually hits something worth hitting.And they kill my ears.You want some coffee or something?That'd be great.We got a big buffet coming up soon.Bacon, eggs, fresh fruit you wouldn't believe.The guy that Hiro saw earlier, up on the deck, pounding Binocular Man on the back, sticks his head into the room.Excuse me, boss, but we're moving into, like, the third phase of our plan.Just thought you'd wanna know.Thank you, Livio.Let me know when the Ivans make it to the pier.The guy sips his coffee, notices Hiro looking confused.See, we got a plan, and the plan is divided up into different phases.Yeah, I got that.The first phase was immobilization.Taking out their chopper.Then we had Phase Two, which was making them think we were trying to kill them in the hotel.I think that this phase succeeded wonderfully.Me, too.Thank you.Another important part of this phase was getting your ass in here, which is also done.I'm part of this plan?The man with the glass eye smiles crisply.If you were not part of this plan, you would be dead.So you know I was coming to Port Sherman?You know that chick Y. T. ?The one you have been using to spy on us?Yeah.No point in denying it.Well, we have been using her to spy on you.Why?Why the hell do you care about me?That would be a tangent from our main conversation, which is about all the phases of the plan.Okay.We just finished Phase Two.Now, in Phase Three, which is ongoing, we allow them to think that they are making an incredible, heroic escape, running down the street toward the pier.Phase Four!shouts Livio, the lieutenant.Scusi, the man with the glass eye says, scooting his chair back, folding his napkin back onto the table.He gets up and walks out of the dining room.Hiro follows him above deck.A couple of dozen Russians are all trying to force their way through the gate onto the pier.Only a few of them can get through at once, and so they end up strung out over a couple of hundred feet, all running toward the safety of the Kodiak Queen.But a dozen or so manage to stay together in a clump: a group of soldiers, forming a human shield around a smaller cluster of men in the center.Bigwigs, the man with the glass eye says, shaking his head philosophically.They all run crablike down the pier, bent down as far as they can go, firing the occasional covering burst of machine gun fire back into Port Sherman.The man with the glass eye is squinting against a cool, sudden breeze.He turns to Hiro with a hint of a grin.Check this out, he says, and presses a button on a little black box in his hand.The explosion is like a single drumbeat, coming from everywhere at once.Hiro can feel it coming up out of the water, shaking his feet.There's no big flame or cloud of smoke, but there is a sort of twin geyser effect that shoots out from underneath the Kodiak Queen, sending jets of white, steamy water upward like unfolding wings.The wings collapse in a sudden downpour, and then the Kodiak Queen seems shockingly low in the water.Low and getting lower.All the men who are running down the pier suddenly stop in their tracks.Now, Binocular Man mumbles into his lapel.There are some smaller explosions down on the pier.The entire pier buckles and writhes like a snake in the water.One segment in particular, the segment with the bigwigs on it, is rocking and seesawing violently, smoke rising from both ends.It has been blown loose from the rest of the pier.All of its occupants fall down in the same direction as it jerks sideways and begins to move, yanked out of its place.Hiro can see the tow cable rising up out of the water as it is stretched tight, running a couple of hundred feet to a small open boat with a big motor on it, which is now pulling out of the harbor.There's still a dozen bodyguards on the segment.One of them sizes up the situation, aims his AK 47 across the water at the boat that's towing them, and loses his brains.There's a sniper on the top deck of the Kowloon.All the other bodyguards throw their guns into the water.Time for Phase Five, the man with the glass eye says.A big fucking breakfast.By the time he and Hiro have sat back down in the dining room, the Kowloon has pulled away from the pier and is headed down the fjord, following a course parallel to the smaller boat that is towing the segment.As they eat, they can look out the window, across a few hundred yards of open water, and see the segment keeping pace with them.All the bigwigs and the bodyguards are on their asses now, keeping their centers of gravity low as the segment bucks nastily.When we get farther away from land, the waves get bigger, the man with the glass eye says.I hate that shit.All I want is to hang on to the breakfast long enough to tamp it down with some lunch.Amen, says Livio, heaping some scrambled eggs onto his plate.Are you going to pick those guys up?Hiro says.Or just let them stay out there for a while?Fuck 'em.Let 'em freeze their asses off.Then when we bring them onto this boat, they'll be ready for it.Won't put up too much of a fight.Hey, maybe they'll even talk to us.Everyone seems pretty hungry.For a while, they just dig into breakfast.After a while, the man with the glass eye breaks the ice by announcing how great the food is, and everyone agrees.Hiro figures it's okay to talk now.I was wondering why you guys were interested in me.Hiro figures that this is always a good thing to know in the case of the Mafia.We're all in the same happy gang, the man with the glass eye says.Which gang is that?Lagos's gang.Huh?Well, it's not really his gang.But he's the guy who put it together.The nucleus around which it formed.How and why and what are you talking about?Okay.He shoves his plate away from him, folds up his napkin, puts it on the table.Lagos had all these ideas.Ideas about all kinds of stuff.So I noticed.He had stacks all over the place, on all different topics.Stacks where he would pull together knowledge from all over the fucking map and tie it all together.He had these things stashed here and there around the Metaverse, waiting for the information to become useful.More than one of them?Hiro says.Supposedly.Well, a few years ago, Lagos approached L.  Bob Rife.He did?Yeah.See, Rife has a million programmers working for him.He was paranoid that they were stealing his data.I know that he was bugging their houses and so on.The reason you know that is because you found it in Lagos's stack.And the reason Lagos bothered to look it up is because he was doing market research.Looking for someone who might pay him hard cash for the stuff he dug up in the Babel/Infocalypse stack.He thought, Hiro says, that L.  Bob Rife might have a use for some viruses.Right.See, I don't understand all this shit.But I guess he found an old virus or something that was aimed at the elite thinkers.The technological priesthood, Hiro says.The infocrats.It wiped out the whole infocracy of Sumer.Whatever.That's crazy, Hiro says.That's like if you find out your employees are stealing ballpoint pens, you take them out and kill them.He wouldn't be able to use it without destroying all his programmers' minds.In its original form, the man with the glass eye says.But the whole point is, Lagos wanted to do research on it.Informational warfare research.Bingo.He wanted to isolate this thing and modify it so it could be used to control the programmers without blowing their brains sky high.And did it work?Who knows?Rife stole Lagos's idea.Just took it and ran with it.And after that, Lagos had no idea what Rife did with it.But a couple of years later, he started getting worried about a lot of stuff he was seeing.Like the explosive growth in Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates.And these Russkies who speak in tongues.And the fact that Rife was digging up this old city  Eridu.Yeah.And the radio astronomy thing.Lagos had a lot of stuff he was worried about.So he began to approach people.He approached us.He approached that girl you used to go out with  Juanita.Yeah.Nice girl.And he approached Mr.Lee.So you might say that a few different people have been working on this little project.46  Where'd they go?Hiro says.Everyone's already looking for the float, as though they all noticed at once that it was missing.Finally they see it, a quarter mile behind them, dead in the water.The bigwigs and the bodyguards are standing up now, all looking in the same direction.The speedboat is circling around to retrieve it.They must have figured out a way to detach the tow cable, Hiro says.Not likely, the man with the glass eye says.It was attached to the bottom, under the water.And it's a steel cable, so there's no way they could cut it.Hiro sees another small craft bobbing on the water, about halfway between the Russians and the speedboat that was towing them.It's not obvious, because it's tiny, close to the water, done up in dull natural colors.It's a one man kayak.Carrying a long haired man.Shit, Livio says.Where the hell did he come from?The kayaker looks behind himself for a few moments, reading the waves, then suddenly turns back around and begins to paddle hard, accelerating, glancing back every few strokes.A big wave is coming, and just as it swells up underneath the kayak, he's matching its speed.The kayak stays on top of the wave and shoots forward like a missile, riding the swell, suddenly going twice as fast as anything else on the water.Digging at the wave with one end of his paddle, the kayaker makes a few crude changes in his direction.Then he parks the paddle athwart the kayak, reaches down inside, and hauls out a small dark object, a tube about four feet long, which he hoists up to one shoulder.He and the speedboat shoot past each other going in opposite directions, separated by a gap of only about twenty feet.Then the speedboat blows up.The Kowloon has overshot the site of all this action by a few thousand yards.It's pulling around into as tight a turn as a vessel of this size can handle, trying to throw a one eighty so it can go back and deal with the Russians and, somewhat more problematically, with Raven.Raven is paddling back toward his buddies.He's such an asshole, Livio says.What's he going to do, tow them out to the Raft behind his fucking kayak?This gives me the creeps, the man with the glass eye says.Make sure we got some guys up there with Stingers.They must have a chopper coming or something.No other ships on the radar, says one of the other soldiers, coming in from the bridge.Just us and them.And no choppers either.You know Raven carries a nuke, right?Hiro says.So I heard.But that kayak's not big enough.It's tiny.I can't believe you'd go out to sea in something like that.A mountain is growing out of the sea.A bubble of black water that keeps rising and broadening.Well behind the bobbing raft, a black tower has appeared, jutting vertically out of the water, a pair of wings sprouting from its top.The tower keeps getting taller, the wings getting higher out of the water, as before and aft, the mountain rises and shapes itself.Red stars and a few numbers.But no one has to read the numbers to know it's a submarine.A nuclear missile submarine.Then it stops.So close to the Russians on their little raft that Gurov and friends can practically jump onto it.Raven paddles toward them, cutting through the waves like a glass knife.Fuck me, the man with the glass eye says.He is utterly astounded.Fuck me, fuck me, fuck me.Uncle Enzo's gonna be pissed.You couldn't of known, Livio says.Should we shoot at 'em?Before the man with the glass eye can make a policy decision, the deck gun on the top of the nukesub opens up.The first shell misses them by just a few yards.Okay, we got a rapidly evolving situation.Hiro, you come with me.The crew of the Kowloon has already sized up the situation and placed their bets on the nuclear submarine.They are running up and down the rails, dropping large fiberglass capsules into the water.The capsules break open to reveal bright orange folds, which blossom into life rafts.Once the deck gunners on the nukesub figure out how to hit the Kowloon, the situation begins to evolve even more rapidly.The Kowloon can't decide whether to sink, burn, or simply disintegrate, so it does all three at once.By that time, most of the people who were on it have made their way onto a life raft.They all bob on the water, zip themselves into orange survival suits, and watch the nukesub.Raven is the last person to go belowdecks on the submarine.He spends a minute or two removing some gear from his kayak: a few items in bags, and one eight foot spear with a translucent, leaf shaped head.Before he disappears into the hatch, he turns toward the wreckage of the Kowloon and holds the harpoon up over his head, a gesture of triumph and a promise all at once.Then he's gone.A couple of minutes later, the submarine is gone, too.That guy gives me the creeps, the man with the glass eye says.47  Once it starts coming clear to her, again, that these people are all twisted freaks, she starts to notice other things about them.For example, the whole time, no one ever looks her in the eye.Especially the men.No sex at all in these guys, they've got it pushed so far down inside of them.She can understand why they don't look at the fat babushkas.But she's a fifteen year old American chick, and she is used to getting the occasional look.Not here.Until she looks up from her big vat of fish one day and finds that she is looking into some guy's chest.And when she follows his chest upward to his neck, and his neck all the way up to his face, she sees dark eyes staring right back at her, right over the top of the counter.He's got something written on his forehead: POOR IMPULSE CONTROL.Which is kind of scary.Sexy, too.It gives him a certain measure of romance that none of these other people have.She was expecting the Raft to be dark and dangerous, and instead it's just like working where her mother works.This guy is the first person she's seen around this place who really looks like he belongs on the Raft.And he's got the look down, too.Incredibly rank style.Although he has a long wispy mustache that doesn't do much for his face.Doesn't bring out his features well at all.Do you take the nasty stuff?One fish head or two?she says, dangling the ladle picturesquely.She always talks trash to people because none of them can understand what she's saying.I'll take whatever you're offering, the guy says.In English.Sort of a crisp accent.I'm not offering anything, she says, but if you want to stand there and browse, that's cool.He stands there and browses for a while.Long enough that people farther back in line stand up on tiptoe to see what the problem is.But when they see that the problem is this particular individual, they get down off their toes real fast, hunch down, sort of blend in to the mass of fishy smelling wool.What's for dessert today?the guy asks.Got anything sweet for me?We don't believe in dessert, Y. T.  says.It's a fucking sin, remember?Depends on your cultural orientation.Oh, yeah?What culture are you oriented to?I am an Aleut.Oh, I've never heard of that.That's because we've been fucked over, the big scary Aleut says, worse than any other people in history.Sorry to hear that, Y. T.  says.So, uh, do you want me to serve up some fish, or are you gonna stay hungry?The big Aleut stares at her for a while.Then he jerks his head sideways and says, Come on.Let's get the fuck out of here.What, and skip out on this cool job?He grins ridiculously.I can find you a better job.In this job, do I get to leave my clothes on?Come on.We're going now, he says, those eyes burning into her.She tries to ignore a sudden warm tense feeling down between her legs.She starts following him down the cafeteria line, heading for a gap where she can exit into the dining area.The head babushka bitch comes stomping out from in back, hollers at her in some incomprehensible language.Y. T.  turns to look back.She feels a pair of big hands sliding up her sides, coming up into her armpits, and she pulls her arms to her sides, trying to stop it.But it's no good, the hands come all the way up and keep lifting, keep rising into the air, bringing her with them.The big guy hoists her right up over the counter like she's a three year old and sets her down next to him.Y. T.  turns back around to see the head babushka bitch, but she is frozen in a mixture of surprise, fear, and sexual outrage.But in the end, fear wins out, she averts her eyes, turns away, and goes to replace Y. T.  at vat position number nine.Thanks for the lift, Y. T.  says, her voice wowing and fluttering ridiculously.Uh, didn't you want to eat something?I was thinking of going out anyway, he says.Going out?Where do you go out on the Raft?Come on, I'll show you.He leads her down passageways and up steep steel stairways and out onto the deck.It's getting close to twilight, the control tower of the Enterprise looms hard and black against a deep gray sky that's getting dark and gloomy so fast that it seems darker, now, than it will at midnight.But for now, none of the lights are on and that's all there is, black steel and slate sky.She follows him down the deck of the ship to the stern.From here it's a thirty foot drop to the water, they are looking out across the prosperous, clean white neighborhood of the Russian people, separated from the squalid dark tangle of the Raft per se by a wide canal patrolled by gun toting blackrobes.There's no stairway or rope ladder here, but there is a thick rope hanging from the railing.The big Aleut guy hauls up a chunk of rope and drapes it under one arm and over one leg in a quick motion.Then he throws one arm around Y. T.'s waist, gathering her in the crook of his arm, leans back, and falls off the ship.She absolutely refuses to scream.She feels the rope stop his body, feels his arm squeeze her so tight she chokes for a moment, and then she's hanging there, hanging in the crook of his arm.She's got her arms down to her side, defiant.But just for the hell of it, she leans into him, wraps her arms around his neck, puts her head on his shoulder, and hangs on tight.He rappels them down the rope, and soon they are standing on the sanitized, prosperous Russian version of the Raft.What's your name anyway?she says.Dmitri Ravinoff, he says.Better known as Raven.Oh, shit.The connections between boats are tangled and unpredictable.To get from point A to point B, you have to wander all over the place.But Raven knows where he's going.Occasionally, he reaches out, grabs her hand, but he doesn't yank her around even though she's going a lot slower than he is.Every so often, he looks back at her with a grin, like, I could hurt you, but I won't.They come to a place where the Russian neighborhood is joined to the rest of the Raft by a wide plank bridge guarded by Uzi dudes.Raven ignores them, takes Y. T.'s hand again, and walks right across the bridge with her.Y. T.  hardly has time to think through the implications of this before it hits her, she looks around, sees all these gaunt Asians, staring back at her like she's a five course meal, and realizes: I'm on the Raft.Actually on the Raft.These are Hong Kong Vietnamese, Raven says.Started out in Vietnam, came to Hong Kong as boat people after the war thereso they've been living on sampans for a couple of generations now.Don't be scared, this isn't dangerous for you.I don't think I can find my way back here, Y. T.  says.Relax, he says.I've never lost a girlfriend.Have you ever had a girlfriend?Raven throws back his head and laughs.A lot, in the old days.Not as many in the past few years.Oh, yeah?The old days?Is that when you got your tattoo?Yeah.I'm an alcoholic.Used to get in a lot of trouble.Been sober for eight years.Then how come everyone's scared of you?Raven turns to her, smiles broadly, shrugs.Oh, because I'm an incredibly ruthless, efficient, cold blooded killer, you know.Y. T.  laughs.So does Raven.What's your job?Y. T.  asks.I'm a harpooner, he says.Like in Moby Dick?Y. T.  likes this idea.She read that book in school.Most of the people in her class, even the power tools, thought that the book was totally entrenched.But she liked all the stuff about harpooning.Nah.Compared to me, those Moby Dicksters were faggots.What kind of stuff do you harpoon?You name it.From there on out, she just looks at him.Or at inanimate objects.Because otherwise she wouldn't see anything except thousands of dark eyes staring back at her.In that way, it's a big change from being a slop slinger for the repressed.Part of it is just because she's so different.But part of it is that there's no privacy on the Raft, you make your way around by hopping from one boat to the next.But each boat is home to about three dozen people, so it's like you are constantly walking through people's living rooms.And bathrooms.And bedrooms.Naturally, they look.They tromp across a makeshift platform built on oil drums.A couple of Vietnamese dudes are there arguing or haggling over something, looks like a slab of fish.The one who's turned toward them sees them coming.His eyes flicker across Y. T.  without pausing, fix on Raven, and go wide.He steps back.The guy he's talking to, who has his back to them, turns around and literally jumps into the air, letting out a suppressed grunt.Both of them back well out of Raven's path.And then she figures out something important: These people aren't looking at her.They're not even giving her a second glance.They're all looking at Raven.And it's not just a case of celebrity watching or something like that.All of these Raft dudes, these tough scary homeboys of the sea, are scared shitless of this guy.And she's on a date with him.And it's just started.Suddenly, walking through another Vietnamese living room, Y. T.  has a flashback to the most excruciating conversation she ever had, which was a year ago when her mother tried to give her advice on what to do if a boy got fresh with her.Yeah, Mom, right.I'll keep that in mind.Yeah, I'll be sure to remember that.Y. T.  knew that advice was worthless, and this goes to show she was right.48  There are four men in the life raft: Hiro Protagonist, self employed stringer for the Central Intelligence Corporation, whose practice used to be limited to so called dry operations, meaning that he sat around and soaked up information and then later spat it back into the Library, the CIC database, without ever actually doing anything.Now his practice has become formidably wet.Hiro is armed with two swords and a nine millimeter semiautomatic pistol, known colloquially as a nine, with two ammunition clips, each carrying eleven rounds.Vic, unspecified last name.If there was still such a thing as income tax, then every year when Vic filled out his 1040 form he would put down, as his occupation, sniper.In classic sniper style, Vic is reticent, unobtrusive.He is armed with a long, large caliber rifle with a bulky mechanism mounted on its top, where a telescopic sight might be found if Vic were not at the leading edge of his profession.The exact nature of this device is not obvious, but Hiro presumes that it is an exquisitely precise sensor package with fine crosshairs superimposed on the middle.Vic may safely be presumed to be carrying additional small concealed weapons.Eliot Chung.Eliot used to be the skipper of a boat called the Kowloon.At the moment, he is between jobs.Eliot grew up in Watts, and when he speaks English, he sounds like a black guy.Genetically speaking, he is entirely Chinese.He is fluent in both black and white English as well as Cantonese, Taxilinga, and some Vietnamese, Spanish, and Mandarin.Eliot is armed with a .44 Magnum revolver, which he carried on board the Kowloon just for the halibut, i. e. , he used it execute halibut before passengers hauled them on board.Halibut grow very large and can thrash so violently that they can easily kill the people who hook them; hence it is prudent to fire a number of shells through their heads before taking them on board.This is the only reason Eliot carries a weapon; the other defensive needs of the Kowloon were seen to by crew members who were specialists in that kind of thing.Fisheye.This is the man with the glass eye.He will only identify himself by his nickname.He is armed with a large, fat black suitcase.The suitcase is massively constructed, with built in wheels, and weighs somewhere between three hundred pounds and a metric ton, as Hiro discovers when he tries to move it.Its weight turns the normally flat bottom of the life raft into a puckered cone.The suitcase has a noteworthy attachment: a flexible three inch thick cable or hose or something, a couple of meters long, that emerges from one corner, runs up the sloping floor of the life raft, over the edge, and trails in the water.At the end of this mysterious tentacle is a hunk of metal about the size of a wastebasket, but so finely sculpted into so many narrow fins and vanes that it appears to have a surface area the size of Delaware.Hiro only saw this thing out of the water for a few chaotic moments, when it was being transferred into the life raft.At that time it was glowing red hot.Since then, it has lurked below the surface, light gray, impossible to see clearly because the water around it is forever churning in a full, rolling boil.Fist sized bubbles of steam coalesce amid its fractal tracery of hot vanes and pummel the surface of the ocean, ceaselessly, all day and all night.The powerless life raft, sloshing around the North Pacific, emits a vast, spreading plume of steam like that of an Iron Horse chugging full blast over the Continental Divide.Neither Hiro nor Eliot ever mentions, or even notices, the by now obvious fact that Fisheye is traveling with a small, self contained nuclear power sourcealmost certainly radiothermal isotopes like the ones that power the Rat Thing.As long as Fisheye refuses to notice this fact, it would be rude for them to bring it up.All of the participants are clad in bright orange padded suits that cover their entire bodies.They are the North Pacific version of life vests.They are bulky and awkward, but Eliot Chung likes to say that in northern waters, the only thing a life vest does is make your corpse float.The lifeboat is an inflatable raft about ten feet long that does not come equipped with a motor.It has a tentlike, waterproof canopy that they can zip up all the way around, turning it into a sealed capsule so that the water stays out even in the most violent weather.For a couple of days, a powerful chill wind coming down out off the mountains drives them out of Oregon, out toward the open water.Eliot explains, cheerfully, that this lifeboat was invented back in the old days, when they had navies and coast guards that would come and rescue stranded travelers.All you had to do was float and be orange.Fisheye has a walkie talkie, but it is a short range device.And Hiro's computer is capable of jacking into the net, but in this regard it functions much like a cellular telephone.It doesn't work out in the middle of nowhere.When the weather is extremely rainy, they sit under the canopy.When it's less rainy, they sit above it.They all have ways of passing the time.Hiro dicks around with his computer, naturally.Being stranded on a life raft in the Pacific is a perfect venue for a hacker.Vic reads and rereads a soaked paperback novel that he had in the pocket of his MAFIA windbreaker when the Kowloon got blown out from under them.These days of waiting are much easier for him.As a professional sniper, he knows how to kill time.Eliot looks at things with his binoculars, even though there is very little to look at.He spends a lot of time messing around with the raft, fretting about it in the way that boat captains do.And he does a lot of fishing.They have plenty of stored food on the raft, but the occasional fresh halibut and salmon are nice to eat.Fisheye has taken what appears to be an instruction manual from the heavy black suitcase.It is a miniature three ring binder with pages of laser printed text.The binder is just a cheap unmarked one bought from a stationery store.In these respects, it is perfectly familiar to Hiro: it bears the earmarks of a high tech product that is still under development.All technical devices require documentation of a sort, but this stuff can only be written by the techies who are doing the actual product development, and they absolutely hate it, always put the dox question off to the very last minute.Then they type up some material on a word processor, run it off on the laser printer, send the departmental secretary out for a cheap binder, and that's that.But this only occupies Fisheye for a little while.He spends the rest of the time just staring off at the horizon, as though he's expecting Sicily to heave into view.It doesn't.He is despondent over the failure of his mission, and spends a lot of time mumbling under his breath, trying to find a way to salvage it.If you don't mind my asking, Hiro says, what was your mission anyway?Fisheye thinks this one over for a while.Well it depends on how you look at it.Nominally, my objective is to get a fifteen year old girl back from these assholes.So my tactic was to take a bunch of their bigwigs hostage, then arrange a trade.Who's this fifteen year old girl?Fisheye shrugs.You know her.It's Y. T.   Is that really your whole objective?The important thing is, Hiro, that you have to understand the Mafia way.And the Mafia way is that we pursue larger goals under the guise of personal relationships.So, for example, when you were a pizza guy you didn't deliver pizzas fast because you made more money that way, or because it was some kind of a fucking policy.You did it because you were carrying out a personal covenant between Uncle Enzo and every customer.This is how we avoid the trap of self perpetuating ideology.Ideology is a virus.So getting this chick back is more than just getting a chick back.It's the concrete manifestation of an abstract policy goal.And we like concreteright, Vic?Vic allows himself a judicious sneer and a deep grinding laugh.What's the abstract policy goal in this case?Hiro says.Not my department, Fisheye says.But I think Uncle Enzo is real pissed at L.  Bob Rife.Hiro is messing around in Flatland.He is doing this partly to conserve the computer's batteries; rendering a three dimensional office takes a lot of processors working fulltime, while a simple two dimensional desktop display requires minimal power.But his real reason for being in Flatland is that Hiro Protagonist, last of the freelance hackers, is hacking.And when hackers are hacking, they don't mess around with the superficial world of Metaverses and avatars.They descend below this surface layer and into the netherworld of code and tangled nam shubs that supports it, where everything that you see in the Metaverse, no matter how lifelike and beautiful and three dimensional, reduces to a simple text file: a series of letters on an electronic page.It is a throwback to the days when people programmed computers through primitive teletypes and IBM punch cards.Since then, pretty and user friendly programming tools have been developed.It's possible to program a computer now by sitting at your desk in the Metaverse and manually connecting little preprogrammed units, like Tinkertoys.But a real hacker would never use such techniques, any more than a master auto mechanic would try to fix a car by sliding in behind the steering wheel and watching the idiot lights on the dashboard.Hiro does not know what he is doing, what he is preparing for.That's okay, though.Most of programming is a matter of laying groundwork, building structures of words that seem to have no particular connection to the task at hand.He knows one thing: The Metaverse has now become a place where you can get killed.Or at least have your brain reamed out to the point where you might as well be dead.This is a radical change in the nature of the place.Guns have come to Paradise.It serves them right, he realizes now.They made the place too vulnerable.They figured that the worst thing that could happen was that a virus might get transferred into your computer and force you to ungoggle and reboot your system.Maybe destroy a little data if you were stupid enough not to install any medicine.Therefore, the Metaverse is wide open and undefended, like airports in the days before bombs and metal detectors, like elementary schools in the days before maniacs with assault rifles.Anyone can go in and do anything that they want to.There are no cops.You can't defend yourself, you can't chase the bad people.It's going to take a lot of work to change thata fundamental rebuilding of the whole Metaverse, carried out on a planetwide, corporate level.In the meantime, there may be a role for individuals who know their way around the place.A few hacks can make a lot of difference in this situation.A freelance hacker could get a lot of shit done, years before the giant software factories bestir themselves to deal with the problem.The virus that ate through Da5id's brain was a string of binary information, shone into his face in the form of a bitmapa series of white and black pixels, where white represents zero and black represents one.They put the bitmap onto scrolls and gave the scrolls to avatars who went around the Metaverse looking for victims.The Clint who tried to infect Hiro in The Black Sun got away, but he left his scroll behindhe didn't reckon on having his arms lopped offand Hiro dumped it into the tunnel system below the floor, the place where the Graveyard Daemons live.Later, Hiro had a Daemon take the scroll back to his workshop.And anything that is in Hiro's house is, by definition, stored inside his own computer.He doesn't have to jack into the global network in order to access it.It's not easy working with a piece of data that can kill you.But that's okay.In Reality, people work with dangerous substances all the timeradioactive isotopes and toxic chemicals.You just have to have the right tools: remote manipulator arms, gloves, goggles, leaded glass.And in Flatland, when you need a tool, you just sit down and write it.So Hiro starts by writing a few simple programs that enable him to manipulate the contents of the scroll without ever seeing it.The scroll, like any other visible thing in the Metaverse, is a piece of software.It contains some code that describes what it looks like, so that your computer will know how to draw it, and some routines that govern the way it rolls and unrolls.And it contains, somewhere inside of itself, a resource, a hunk of data, the digital version of the Snow Crash virus.Once the virus has been extracted and isolated, it is easy enough for Hiro to write a new program called SnowScan.SnowScan is a piece of medicine.That is, it is code that protects Hiro's systemboth his hardware and, as Lagos would put it, his biowarefrom the digital Snow Crash virus.Once Hiro has installed it in his system, it will constantly scan the information coming in from outside, looking for data that matches the contents of the scroll.If it notices such information, it will block it.There's other work to do in Flatland.Hiro's good with avatars, so he writes himself an invisible avatarjust because, in the new and more dangerous Metaverse, it might come in handy.This is easy to do poorly and surprisingly tricky to do well.Almost anyone can write an avatar that doesn't look like anything, but it will lead to a lot of problems when it is used.Some Metaverse real estateincluding The Black Sunwants to know how big your avatar is so that it can figure out whether you are colliding with another avatar or some obstacle.If you give it an answer of zeroyou make your avatar infinitely smallyou will either crash that piece of real estate or else make it think that something is very wrong.You will be invisible, but everywhere you go in the Metaverse you will leave a swath of destruction and confusion a mile wide.In other places, invisible avatars are illegal.If your avatar is transparent and reflects no light whatsoeverthe easiest kind to writeit will be recognized instantly as an illegal avatar and alarms will go off.It has to be written in such a way that other people can't see it, but the real estate software doesn't realize that it's invisible.There are about a hundred little tricks like this that Hiro wouldn't know about if he hadn't been programming avatars for people like Vitaly Chernobyl for the last couple of years.To write a really good invisible avatar from scratch would take a long time, but he puts one together in several hours by recycling bits and pieces of old projects left behind in his computer.Which is how hackers usually do it.While he's doing that, he comes across a rather old folder with some transportation software in it.This is left over from the very old days of the Metaverse, before the Monorail existed, when the only way to get around was to walk or to write a piece of ware that simulated a vehicle.In the early days, when the Metaverse was a featureless black ball, this was a trivial job.Later on, when the Street went up and people started building real estate, it became more complicated.On the Street, you can pass through other people's avatars.But you can't pass through walls.You can't enter private property.And you can't pass through other vehicles, or through permanent Street fixtures such as the Ports and the stanchions that support the monorail line.If you try to collide with any of these things, you don't die or get kicked out of the Metaverse; you just come to a complete stop, like a cartoon character running spang into a concrete wall.In other words, once the Metaverse began to fill up with obstacles that you could run into, the job of traveling across it at high speed suddenly became more interesting.Maneuverability became an issue.Size became an issue.Hiro and Da5id and the rest of them began to switch away from the enormous, bizarre vehicles they had favored at firstVictorian houses on tank treads, rolling ocean liners, mile wide crystalline spheres, flaming chariots drawn by dragonsin favor of small maneuverable vehicles.Motorcycles, basically.A Metaverse vehicle can be as fast and nimble as a quark.There's no physics to worry about, no constraints on acceleration, no air resistance.Tires never squeal and brakes never lock up.The one thing that can't be helped is the reaction time of the user.So when they were racing their latest motorcycle software, holding wild rallies through Downtown at Mach 1, they didn't worry about engine capacity.They worried about the user interface, the controls that enabled the rider to transfer his reactions into the machine, to steer, accelerate, or brake as quickly as he could think.Because when you're in a pack of bike racers going through a crowded area at that speed, and you run into something and suddenly slow down to a speed of exactly zero, you can forget about catching up.One mistake and you've lost.Hiro had a pretty good motorcycle.He probably could have had the best one on the Street, simply because his reflexes are unearthly.But he was more preoccupied with sword fighting than motorcycle riding.He opens up the most recent version of his motorcycle software, gets familiar with the controls again.He ascends from Flatland into the three dimensional Metaverse and practices riding his bike around his yard for a while.Beyond the boundaries of his yard is nothing but blackness, because he's not jacked into the net.It is a lost, desolate sensation, kind of like floating on a life raft in the Pacific Ocean.49  Sometimes they see boats in the distance.A couple of these even swing close by to check them out, but none of them seems to be in that rescuing mood.There are few altruists in the vicinity of the Raft, and it must be evident that they don't have much to steal.From time to time, they see an old deep water fishing boat, fifty to a hundred feet long, with half a dozen or so small fast boats clustered around it.When Eliot informs them that these are pirate vessels, Vic and Fisheye prick up their ears.Vic unwraps his rifle from the collection of Hefty bags that he uses to protect it from the salt spray, and detaches the bulky sight so that they can use it as a spyglass.Hiro can't see any reason to pull the sight off the rifle in order to do this, other than the fact that if you don't, it looks like you're drawing a bead on whatever you're looking at.Whenever a pirate vessel comes into view, they all take turns looking at it through the sight, playing with all the different sensor modes: visible, infrared, and so on.Eliot has spent enough time knocking around the Rim that he has become familiar with the colors of the different pirate groups, so by examining them through the sight he can tell who they are: Clint Eastwood and his band parallel them for a few minutes one day, checking them out, and the Magnificent Seven send out one of their small boats to zoom by them and look for potential booty.Hiro's almost hoping they get taken prisoner by the Seven, because they have the nicest looking pirate ship: a former luxury yacht with Exocet launch tubes kludged to the foredeck.But this reconnaissance leads nowhere.The pirates, unschooled in thermodynamics, do not grasp the implications of the eternal plume of steam coming from beneath the life raft.One morning, a big old trawler materializes very close to them, congealing out of nothing as the fog lifts.Hiro has been hearing its engines for a while, but didn't realize how close it was.Who are they?Fisheye says, choking on a cup of the freeze dried coffee he despises so much.He's wrapped up in a space blanket and partly snuggled underneath the boat's waterproof canopy, just his face and hands visible.Eliot scopes them out with the sight.He is not a real demonstrative guy, but it's clear that he is not very happy with what he sees.That is Bruce Lee, he says.How is that significant?Fisheye says.Well, check out the colors, Eliot says.The ship is close enough that everyone can see the flag pretty clearly.It's a red banner with a silver fist in the middle, a pair of nunchuks crossed beneath it, the initials B and L on either side.What about 'em?Fisheye says.Well, the guy who calls himself Bruce Lee, who's like the leader?He got a vest with those colors on the back.So?So, it's not just embroidered or painted, it's actually done in scalps.Patchwork, like.Say what?Hiro says.There's a rumor, just a rumor, man, that he went through the Refu ships looking for people with red or silver hair so he could collect the scalps he needed.Hiro is still absorbing that when Fisheye makes an unexpected decision.I want to talk to this Bruce Lee character, he says.He interests me.Why the hell do you want to talk to this fucking psycho?Eliot says.Yeah, Hiro says.Didn't you see that series on Eye Spy?He's a maniac.Fisheye throws up his hands as if to say the answer is, like Catholic theology, beyond mortal comprehension.This is my decision, he says.Who the fuck are you?Eliot says.President of the fucking boat, Fisheye says.I hereby nominate myself.Is there a second?Yup, Vic says, the first time he has spoken in forty eight hours.All in favor say aye, Fisheye says.Aye, Vic says, bursting into florid eloquence.I win, Fisheye says.So how do we get these Bruce Lee guys to come over here and talk to us?Why should they want to?Eliot says.We got nothing they want except for poontang.Are you saying these guys are homos?Fisheye says, his face shriveling up.Shit, man, Eliot says, you didn't even blink when I told you about the scalps.I knew I didn't like any of this boat shit, Fisheye says.If this makes any difference to you, they're not gay in the sense that we usually think of it, Eliot explains.They're het, but they're pirates.They'll go after anything that's warm and concave.Fisheye makes a snap decision.Okay, you two guys, Hiro and Eliot, you're Chinese.Take off your clothes.What?Do it.I'm the president, remember?You want Vic to do it for you?Eliot and Hiro can't help looking over at Vic, who is just sitting there like a lump.There is something about his extremely blas attitude that inspires fear.Do it or I'll fucking kill you, Fisheye says, finally driving the point home.Eliot and Hiro, bobbing awkwardly on the unsteady floor of the raft, peel off their survival suits and step out of them.Then they pull off the rest of their clothes, exposing smooth bare skin to the air for the first time in a few days.The trawler comes right alongside of them, no more than twenty feet away, and cuts its engines.They are nicely equipped: half a dozen Zodiacs with new outboards, an Exocet type missile, two radars, and a fifty caliber machine gun at each end of the boat, currently unmanned.A couple of speedboats are being towed behind the trawler like dinghys and each of these also has a heavy machine gun.And there is also a thirty six foot motor yacht, following them under its own power.There are a couple of dozen guys in Bruce Lee's pirate band, and they are now lined up along the trawler's railing, grinning, whistling, howling like wolves, and waving unrolled trojans in the air.Don't worry, man, I'm not going to let 'em fuck you, Fisheye says, grinning.What you gonna do, Eliot says, hand them a papal encyclical?I'm sure they'll listen to reason, Fisheye says.These guys aren't scared of the Mafia, if that's what you have in mind, Eliot says.That's just because they don't know us very well.Finally, the leader comes out, Bruce Lee himself, a fortyish guy in a Kevlar vest, an ammo vest stretched over that, a diagonal bandolier, samurai swordHiro would love to take him onnunchuks, and his colors, the patchwork of human scalps.He flashes them a nice grin, has a look at Hiro and Eliot, gives them a highly suggestive, thrusting thumbs up gesture, and then struts up and down the length of the boat one time, swapping high fives with his merry men.Every so often, he picks out one of the pirates at random and gestures at the man's trojan.The pirate puts his condom to his lips and inflates it into a slippery ribbed balloon.Then Bruce Lee inspects it, making sure there are no leaks.Obviously, the man runs a tight ship.Hiro can't help staring at the scalps on Bruce Lee's back.The pirates note his interest and mug for him, pointing to the scalps, nodding, looking back at him with wide, mocking eyes.The colors look much too uniformno change in the red from one to the next.Hiro concludes that Bruce Lee, contrary to his reputation, must have just gone out and gotten scalps of any old color, bleached them, and dyed them.What a wimp.Finally, Bruce Lee works his way back to midship and flashes them another big grin.He has a great, dazzling grin and he knows it; maybe it's those one karat diamonds Krazy Glued to his front teeth.Jammin' boat, he says.Maybe you, me swap, huh?Hahaha.Everyone on the life raft, except for Vic, just smiles a brittle smile.Where you goin'?Key West?Hahaha.Bruce Lee examines Hiro and Eliot for a while, rotates his index finger to indicate that they should spin around and display their business ends.They do.Quanto?Bruce Lee says, and all the pirates get uproarious, most of all Bruce Lee.Hiro can feel his anal sphincter contracting to the size of a pore.He's asking how much we cost, Eliot says.It's a joke, see, because they know they can come over and have our asses for free.Oh, hilarious!Fisheye says.While Hiro and Eliot literally freeze their asses, he's still snuggled up under the canopy, that bastard.Poonmissile, like?Bruce Lee says, pointing to one of the antiship missiles on the deck.Bugs?Motorolas?Poonmissile is a Harpoon antiship missile, real expensive, Eliot says.A bug is a microchip.Motorola would be one brand, like Ford or Chevy.Bruce Lee deals in a lot of electronicsyou know, typical Asian pirate dude.He'd give us a Harpoon missile for you guys?Fisheye says.No!He's being sarcastic, shithead!Eliot says.Tell him we want a boat with an outboard motor, Fisheye says.Want one zode, one kicker, fillerup, Eliot says.Suddenly Bruce Lee gets real serious and actually considers it.Scope clause, chomsayen?Gauge and gag.He'll consider it if they can come and check out the merchandise first, Eliot says.They want to check out how tight we are, and whether we are capable of suppressing our gag reflex.These are all terms from the Raft brothel industry.Ombwas scope like twelves to me, hahaha.Us homeboys look like we have twelve gauge assholes, Eliot says, i. e. , that we are all stretched out and worthless.Fisheye speaks up on his own.No, no, four tens, totally!The entire deck of the pirate ship titters with excitement.No way, Bruce Lee says.These ombwas, Fisheye says, still got cherries up in there!The whole deck erupts in rude, screaming laughter.One of the pirates scrambles up to balance on the railing, gyrates one fist in the air, and hollers: ba ka na zu ma lay ga no ma la aria ma na po no a ab zu ...By that point all the other pirates have stopped laughing, gotten serious looks on their faces, and joined in, bellowing their own private streams of babble, rattling the air with a profound hoarse ululation.Hiro's feet go out from under him as the raft moves suddenly; he can see Eliot falling down next to him.He looks up at Bruce Lee's ship and flinches involuntarily as he sees what looks like a dark wave cresting over the rail, washing over the row of standing pirates, starting at the stern of the trawler and working its way forward.But this is just some kind of optical illusion.It is not really a wave at all.Suddenly, they are fifty feet away from the trawler, not twenty feet.As the laughter on the railing dies away, Hiro hears a new sound: a low whirring noise from the direction of Fisheye, and from the atmosphere around them, a tearing, hissing noise, like the sound just before a thunderbolt strikes, like the sound of sheets being ripped in half.Looking back at Bruce Lee's trawler, he sees that the dark wavelike phenomenon was a wave of blood, as though someone hosed down the deck with a giant severed aorta.But it didn't come from outside.It erupted from the pirates' bodies, one at a time, moving from the stern to the bow.The deck of Bruce Lee's ship is now utterly quiet and motionless except for blood and gelatinized internal organs sliding down the rusted steel and plopping softly into the water.Fisheye is up on his knees now and has torn away the canopy and space blanket that have covered him until this point.In one hand he is holding a long device a couple of inches in diameter, which is the source of the whirring noise.It is a circular bundle of parallel tubes about pencil sized and a couple of feet long, like a miniaturized Gatling gun.It whirs around so quickly that the individual tubes are difficult to make out; when it is operating, it is in fact ghostly and transparent because of this rapid motion, a glittering, translucent cloud jutting out of Fisheye's arm.The device is attached to a wrist thick bundle of black tubes and cables that snake down into the large suitcase, which lies open on the bottom of the raft.The suitcase has a built in color monitor screen with graphics giving information about the status of this weapons system: how much ammo is left, the status of various subsystems.Hiro just gets a quick glimpse at it before all of the ammunition on board Bruce Lee's ship begins to explode.See, I told you they'd listen to Reason, Fisheye says, shutting down the whirling gun.Now Hiro sees a nameplate tacked onto the control panel.Fucking recoil pushed us halfway to China, Fisheye says appreciatively.Did you do that?What just happened?Eliot says.I did it.With Reason.See, it fires these teeny little metal splinters.They go real fastmore energy than a rifle bullet.Depleted uranium.The spinning barrels have now slowed almost to a stop.It looks like there are about two dozen of them.I thought you hated machine guns, Hiro says.I hate this fucking raft even more.Let's go get ourselves something that goes, you know.Something with a motor on it.Because of the fires and small explosions going off on Bruce Lee's pirate ship, it takes them a minute to realize that several people are still alive there, still shooting at them.When Fisheye becomes aware of this, he pulls the trigger again, the barrels whirl themselves up into a transparent cylinder, and the tearing, hissing noise begins again.As he waves the gun back and forth, hosing the target down with a hypersonic shower of depleted uranium, Bruce Lee's entire ship seems to sparkle and glitter, as though Tinkerbell was flying back and forth from stem to stem, sprinkling nuclear fairy dust over it.Bruce Lee's smaller yacht makes the mistake of coming around to see what's going on.Fisheye turns toward it for a moment and its high, protruding bridge slides off into the water.Major structural elements of the trawler are losing their integrity.Enormous popping and wrenching noises are coming from inside as big pieces of Swiss cheesed metal give way, and the superstructure is slowly collapsing down into the hull like a botched souffl.When Fisheye notes this, he ceases fire.Cut it out, boss, Vic says.I'm melting!Fisheye crows.We could have used that trawler, asshole, Eliot says, vindictively yanking his pants back on.I didn't mean to blow it all up.I guess the little bullets just go through everything.Sharp thinking, Fisheye, Hiro says.Well, I'm sorry I took a little action to save our asses.Come on, let's go get one of them little boats before they all burn.They paddle in the direction of the decapitated yacht.By the time they reach it, Bruce Lee's trawler is just a listing, empty steel hull with flames and smoke pouring out of it, spiced by the occasional explosion.The remaining portion of the yacht has many, many tiny little holes in it, and glitters with exploded fragments of fiberglass: a million tiny little glass fibers about a millimeter long.The skipper and a crew member, or rather the stew that they turned into when the bridge was hit by Reason, slid off into the water along with the rest of the debris, leaving behind no evidence of their having been there except for a pair of long parallel streaks trailing off into the water.But there is a Filipino boy down in the galley, the galley so low, unhurt and only dimly aware of what happened.A number of electrical cables have been sawn in half.Eliot digs up a toolbox from belowdecks and spends the next twelve hours patching things together to the point where the engine can be started and the yacht can be steered.Hiro, who has a rudimentary knowledge of electrical stuff, acts as gofer and limp dicked adviser.Did you hear the way the pirates were talking, before Fisheye opened up on them?Hiro asks Eliot while they are working.You mean in pidgin?No.At the very end.The babbling.Yeah.That's a Raft thing.It is?Yeah.One guy will start in and the rest will follow.I think it's just a fad.But it's common on the Raft?Yeah.They all speak different languages, you know, all those different ethnic groups.It's like the fucking Tower of Babel.I think when they make that soundwhen they babble at each otherthey're just imitating what all the other groups sound like.The Filipino kid starts making them some food.Vic and Fisheye sit down in the main cabin belowdecks, eating, going through Chinese magazines, looking at pictures of Asian chicks, and occasionally looking at nautical charts.When Eliot gets the electrical system back up and running, Hiro plugs his personal computer in, to recharge its batteries.By the time the yacht is up and running again, it's dark.To the southwest, a fluctuating column of light is playing back and forth against the low overhanging cloud layer.Is that the Raft over there?Fisheye says, pointing to the light, as all hands converge on Eliot's makeshift control center.It is, Eliot says.They light it up at night so that the fishing boats can find their way back to it.How far away do you think it is?Fisheye says.Eliot shrugs.Twenty miles.And how far to land?I have no idea.Bruce Lee's skipper probably knew, but he's been pureed along with everyone else.You're right, Fisheye says.I should have set it on whip' or chop. 'The Raft usually stays at least a hundred miles offshore, Hiro says, to reduce the danger of snags.How we doing on gas?I dipped the tank, Eliot says, and it looks like we're not doing so well, to tell you the truth.What does that mean, not doing so well?It's not always easy to read the level when you're out to sea, Eliot says.And I don't know how efficient these engines are.But if we're really eighty or a hundred miles offshore, we might not make it.So we go to the Raft, Fisheye says.We go to the Raft and persuade someone it's in his best interests to give us some fuel.Then, back to the mainland.No one really believes it's going to happen this way, least of all Fisheye.And, he continues, while we're thereon the Raftafter we get the fuel and before we go homesome other stuff might happen, too, you know.Life's unpredictable.If you have something in mind, why don't you just spit it out?Hiro says.Okay.Policy decision.The hostage tactic failed.So we go for an extraction.Extraction of what?Of Y. T.   I go along with that, Hiro says, but I have another person I want to extract also, as long as we're extracting.Who?Juanita.Come on, you said yourself she was a nice girl.If she's on the Raft, maybe she's not so nice, Fisheye says.I want to extract her anyway.We're all in this together, right?We're all part of Lagos's gang.Bruce Lee has some people there, Eliot says.Correction.Had.But what I'm saying is, they're going to be pissed.You think they're going to be pissed.I think they're going to be scared shitless, Fisheye says.Now drive the boat, Eliot.Come on, I'm sick of all this fucking water.50  Raven ushers Y. T.  onto a flat assed boat with a canopy on top.It is some kind of a riverboat that has been turned into a Vietnamese/American/Thai/Chinese business establishment, kind of a bar/restaurant/whorehouse/gambling den.It has a few big rooms, where lots of people are letting it all hang out, and a lot of little tiny steel walled rooms down below where God knows what kind of activity is taking place.The main room is packed with lowlife revelry.The smoke ties her bronchial passages into granny knots.The place is equipped with a shattering Third World sound system: pure distortion echoing off painted steel walls at three hundred decibels.A television set bolted onto one wall is showing foreign cartoons, done up in a two color scheme of faded magenta and lime green, in which a ghoulish wolf, kind of like Wile E.  Coyote with rabies, gets repeatedly executed in ways more violent than even Warner Bros.could think up.It's a snuff cartoon.The soundtrack is either turned off completely or else over whelmed by the screeching melody coming out of the speakers.A bunch of erotic dancers are performing at one end of the room.It's impossibly crowded, they'll never get a place to sit.But shortly after Raven comes into the room, half a dozen guys in the corner suddenly stand bolt upright and scatter from a table, snatching up their cigarettes and drinks almost as an afterthought.Raven pushes Y. T.  through the room ahead of him, like she's a figurehead on his kayak, and everywhere they go, people are shoved out of her way by Raven's almost palpable personal force field.Raven bends down and looks under the table, picks a chair up off the floor and looks at the undersideyou can never be too careful about those chair bombssets it down, pushed all the way back into the corner where two steel walls meet, and sits down.He gestures for Y. T.  to do the same, and she does, her back to the action.From here, she can see Raven's face, illuminated mostly by occasional stabs of light filtering through the crowd from the mirrored ball over the erotic dancers, and by the generalized green and magenta haze coming out of the TV set, spiked by the occasional flash when the cartoon wolf makes the mistake of swallowing another hydrogen bomb, or has the misfortune to get hosed down again with a flamethrower.A waiter's there immediately.Raven commences hollering across the table at her.She can't hear him, but maybe he's asking her what she wants.A cheeseburger!she screams back at him.Raven laughs, shakes his head.You see any cows around here?Anything but fish!she screams.Raven talks to the waiter for a while in some variant of Taxilinga.I ordered you some squid, he hollers.That's a mollusk.Great.Raven, the last of the true gentlemen.There is a shouted conversation lasting the better part of an hour.Raven does most of the shouting.Y. T.  just listens, smiles, and nods.Hopefully, he's not saying something like I enjoy really violent, abusive sex acts.She doesn't think he's talking about that at all.He's talking politics.She hears a fragmented history of the Aleuts, a burst here and a burst here, when Raven isn't poking squid into his mouth and the music isn't too loud:  Russians fucked us over ...smallpox had a ninety percent mortality rate ...worked as slaves in their sealing industry ...Seward's folly ...Fucking Nipponese took away my father in forty two, put him in a POW camp for the duration ...Then the Americans fucking nuked us.Can you believe that shit?Raven says.There's a lull in the music; suddenly she can hear complete sentences.The Nipponese say they're the only people who were ever nuked.But every nuclear power has one aboriginal group whose territory they nuked to test their weapons.In America, they nuked the Aleutians.Amchitka.My father, Raven says, grinning proudly, was nuked twice: once at Nagasaki, when he was blinded, and then again in 1972, when the Americans nuked our homeland.Great, Y. T.  thinks.She's got a new boyfriend and he's a mutant.Explains one or two things.I was born a few months later, Raven continues, by way of totally hammering that point home.How did you get hooked up with these Orthos?I got away from our traditions and ended up living in Soldotna, working on oil rigs, Raven says, like Y. T.  is supposed to just know where Soldotna is.That was when I did my drinking and got this, he says, pointing to his tattoo.That's also when I learned how to make love to a womanwhich is the only thing I do better than harpooning.Y. T.  can't help but think that fucking and harpooning are closely related activities in Raven's mind.But as crude as the man is, she can't get around the fact that he's making her uncomfortably horny.I used to work fishing boats too, to make a little extra money.We would come back from a forty eight hour halibut openingthis was back in the old days when they had fishing regulationsand we'd put on our survival suits, stick beers into the pockets, and jump into the water and just float around drinking all night long.And one time we were doing this and I drank until I passed out.And when I woke up, it was the next day, or maybe a couple of days later, I don't know.And I was floating in my survival suit out in the middle of the Cook Inlet, all alone.The other guys on my fishing boat had forgotten about me.Conveniently enough, Y. T.  thinks.Anyway, I floated for a couple of days.Got real thirsty.Ended up washing ashore on Kodiak Island.By this time, I was real sick with the DTs and everything else.But I washed up near a Russian Orthodox church and they found me, took me in, and straightened me out.And that was when I saw that the Western, American lifestyle had come this close to killing me.Here comes the sermon.And I saw that we can only live through faith, living a simple lifestyle.No booze.No television.None of that stuff.So what are we doing in this place?He shrugs.This is an example of the bad places I used to hang out.But if you're going to get decent food on the Raft, you have to come to a place like this.A waiter approaches the table.His eyes are big, his movements tentative.He's not coming to take an order; he's coming to deliver bad news.Sir, you are wanted on the radio.I'm sorry.Who is it?Raven says.The waiter just looks around him like he can't even speak the name in public.It's very important, he says.Raven heaves a big sigh, grabs one last piece of fish and pokes it into his mouth.He stands up, and before Y. T.  can react, gives her a kiss on the cheek.Honey, I got a job to do, or something.Just wait right here for me, okay?Here?Nobody will fuck with you, Raven says, as much for the benefit of the waiter as for Y. T.51  The Raft looks uncannily cheerful from a few miles away.A dozen searchlights, and at least that many lasers, are mounted on the towering superstructure of the Enterprise, waving back and forth against the clouds like a Hollywood premiere.Closer up, it doesn't look so bright and crisp.The vast matted tangle of small boats radiates a murky cloud of yellow light that spoils the contrast.A couple of patches of the Raft are burning.Not a nice cheery bonfire type of thing, but a high burbling flame with black smoke sliding out of it, like you get from a large quantity of gasoline.Gang warfare, maybe, Eliot theorizes.Energy source, Hiro guesses.Entertainment, Fisheye says.They don't have cable on the fucking Raft.Before they really plunge into Hell, Eliot takes the lid off the fuel tank and slides the dipstick into there, checking the fuel supply.He doesn't say anything, but he doesn't look especially happy.Turn off all the lights, Eliot says when it seems they are still miles away.Remember that we have already been sighted by several hundred or even several thousand people who are armed and hungry.Vic is already going around the boat shutting off lights via the simple expedient of a ball peen hammer.Fisheye just stands there and listens intently to Eliot, suddenly respectful.Eliot continues.Take off all the bright orange clothing, even if it means we get cold.From now on, we lay down on the decks, expose ourselves as little as possible, and we don't talk to each other unless necessary.Vic, you stay midships with your rifle and wait for someone to hit us with a spotlight.Anyone hits us with a spotlight from any direction, you shoot it out.That includes flashlights from small boats.Hiro, your job is gunwale patrol.You just keep going around the edges of this yacht, anywhere that a swimmer could climb up over the edge and slip on board, and when that happens, cut his arms off.Also, be on the lookout for any kind of grappling hook type stuff.Fisheye, if any other floating object comes within a hundred feet of us, sink it.If you see Raft people with antennas coming out of their heads, try to kill them first, because they can talk to each other.Antennas coming out of their heads?Hiro says.Yeah.Raft gargoyle types, Eliot says.Who are they?How the fuck should I know?I've just seen 'em a few times, from a distance.Anyway, I'm going to take us straight in toward the center, and once we get close enough, I'll turn to starboard and swing around the Raft counterclockwise, looking for someone who might be willing to sell us fuel.If worse comes to worst and we end up on the Raft itself, we stick together and we hire ourselves a guide, because if we try to move across the Raft without the help of someone who knows the web, we'll get into a bad situation.Like what kind of a bad situation?Fisheye asks.Like hanging on a rotted out slime covered cargo net between two ships rocking different ways, with nothing underneath us except ice water full of plague rats, toxic waste, and killer whales.Any questions?Yeah, Fisheye says.Can I go home now?Good.If Fisheye is scared, so's Hiro.Remember what happened to the pirate named Bruce Lee, Eliot says.He was well armed and powerful.He pulled up alongside a life raft full of Refus one day, looking for some poontang, and he was dead before he knew it.Now there are a lot of people who want to do that to us.Don't they have some kind of cops or something?Vic says.I heard they did.In other words, Vic has killed a lot of time going to Raft movies in Times Square.The people up on the Enterprise operate in kind of a wrath of God mode, Eliot says.They have big guns mounted around the edge of the flight deckbig Gatling guns like Reason except with larger bullets.They were originally put there to shoot down Exocet missiles.They strike with the force of a meteorite.If people act up out on the Raft, they will make the problem go away.But a little murder or riot isn't enough to get their attention.If it's a rocket duel between rival pirate organizations, that's different.Suddenly, they've been nailed with a spotlight so big and powerful they can't look anywhere near it.Then it's dark again, and a gunshot from Vic's rifle is searing and reverberating across the water.Nice shooting, Vic, Fisheye says.It's, like, one of them drug dealer boats, Vic says, looking through his magic sight.Five guys on it.Headed our way.He fires another round.Correction.Four guys on it.Boom.Correction, they're not headed our way anymore.Boom.A fireball erupts from the ocean two hundred feet away.Correction.No boat.Fisheye laughs and actually slaps his thigh.You recording all of this, Hiro?No, Hiro says.Wouldn't come out.Oh.Fisheye seems taken aback, like this changes everything.That's the first wave, Eliot says.Rich pirates looking for easy pickings.But they've got a lot to lose, so they scare easy.Another big yacht type boat is out there, Vic says, but they're turning away now.Above the deep chortling noise of their yacht's big diesel, they can hear the high whine of outboard motors.Second wave, Eliot says.Pirate wannabes.These guys will come in a lot faster, so stay sharp.This thing has millimeter wave on it, Fisheye says.Hiro looks at him; his face is illuminated from below by the glow of Reason's built in screen.I can see these guys like it's fucking daylight.Vic fires several rounds, pops the clip out of his rifle, shoves in a new one.A zodiac zips past, skittering across the wavetops, strafing them with weak flashlight beams.Fisheye fires a couple of short bursts from Reason, blasting clouds of warm steam into the cold night air, but misses them.Save your ammo, Eliot says.Even with Uzis, they can't hit us until they slow down a little bit.And even with radar, you can't hit them.A second zodiac whips past them on the other side, closer than the last one.Vic and Fisheye both hold their fire.They hear it orbiting them, swinging back around the way it came.Those two boats are getting together out there, Vic says.They got two more of them.A total of four.They're talking.We've been reconned, Eliot says, and they're planning their tactics.The next time is for real.A second later, two fantastically loud blasts sound from the rear of the yacht, where Eliot is, accompanied by brief flashes of light.Hiro turns around to see a body collapsing to the deck.It's not Eliot.Eliot is crouching there holding his oversized halibut shooter.Hiro runs back, looks at the dead swimmer in the dim light scattering off the clouds.He's naked except for a thick coating of black grease and a belt with a gun and a knife in it.He's still holding on to the rope that he used to pull himself on board.The rope is attached to a grappling hook that has caught in the jagged, broken fiberglass on one side of the yacht.Third wave is coming a little early, Eliot says, his voice high and shaky.He's trying so hard to sound cool that it has the opposite effect.Hiro, this gun's got three rounds left in it, and I'm saving the last one for you if any more of these motherfuckers get on board.Sorry, Hiro says.He draws the short wakizashi.He would feel better if he could carry his nine in the other hand, but he needs one hand free to steady himself and keep from falling overboard.He makes a quick circuit of the yacht, looking for more grappling hooks, and actually finds one on the other side, hooked into one of the railing stanchions, a taut rope trailing out behind it into the sea.Correction: It's a taut cable.His sword won't cut it.And the tension on the rope is such that he can't get it unhooked from the stanchion.As he's squatting there playing with the grappling hook, a greasy hand rises up out of the water and grabs his wrist.Another hand gropes for Hiro's other hand and grabs the sword instead.Hiro yanks the weapon free, feeling it do damage, and shoves the wakizashi point first into the place between those two hands just as someone is sinking his teeth into Hiro's crotch.But Hiro's crotch is protectedthe motorcycle outfit has a hard plastic cupand so this human shark just gets a mouthful of bullet proof fabric.Then his grip loosens, and he falls into the sea.Hiro releases the grappling hook and drops it in with him.Vic fires three rounds in quick succession, and a fireball illuminates one whole side of the ship.For a moment, they can see everything around them for a distance of a hundred yards, and the effect is like turning on your kitchen lights in the middle of the night and finding your countertops aswarm with rats.At least a dozen small boats are around them.They got Molotov cocktails, Vic says.The people in the boats can see them, too.Tracers fly around them from several directions.Hiro can see muzzle flashes in at least three places.Fisheye opens up once, twice with Reason, just firing short bursts of a few dozen rounds each, and produces one fireball, this one farther away from the yacht.It's been at least five seconds since Hiro moved, so he checks this area for grappling hooks again and resumes his circuit around the edge of the yacht.This time it's clear.The two greaseballs must have been working together.A Molotov cocktail arcs through the sky and impacts on the starboard side of the yacht, where it's not going to do much damage.Inside would be a lot worse.Fisheye uses Reason to hose down the area from which the Molotov was thrown, but now that the side of the boat is all lit up from the flames, they draw more small arms fire.In that light, Hiro can see trickles of blood running down from the area where Vic ensconced himself.On the port side, he sees something long and narrow and low in the water, with the torso of a man rising out of it.The man has long hair that falls down around his shoulders, and he's holding an eight foot pole in one hand.Just as Hiro sees him, he's throwing it.The harpoon darts across twenty feet of open water.The million chipped facets of its glass head refract the light and make it look like a meteor.It takes Fisheye in the back, slices easily through the bulletproof fabric he's wearing under his suit, and comes all the way out the other side of his body.The impact lifts Fisheye into the air and throws him off the boat; he lands face first in the water, already dead.Mental note: Raven's weapons do not show up on radar.Hiro looks back in the direction of Raven, but he's already gone.A couple more greaseballs, side by side, vault over the railing about ten feet forward of Hiro, but for a moment they're dazzled by the flames.Hiro pulls out his nine, aims it their way, and keeps pulling the trigger until both of them have fallen back into the water.He's not sure how many rounds are left in the gun now.There's a coughing, hissing noise, and the flame light gets dim and finally goes out.Eliot nailed it with a fire extinguisher.The yacht jerks out from under Hiro's feet, and he hits the deck with his face and shoulder.Getting up, he realizes that either they've just rammed, or been rammed by, something big.There is a thudding noise, feet running on the deck.Hiro hears some of these feet near him, drops his wakizashi, pulls his katana, whirls at the same time, snapping the long blade into someone's midsection.Meanwhile they're dragging a long knife down his back, but it doesn't penetrate the fabric, just hurts a little.
