But she saw him leaving the scene.She's following him.Why would she want to do that!?I guess you told her to, or something.I didn't think she'd take off after him.Well, she doesn't know that he killed the guy, Squeaky says.She just phoned in a sightinghe's riding his Harley into Chinatown.And he begins running up the embankment.A couple of Enforcers' cars are parked on the shoulder of the highway up there, waiting.Hiro tags along.His legs are in incredible shape from sword fighting, and he manages to catch up to Squeaky by the time he reaches his car.When the driver undoes the electric door locks, Hiro scoots into the back seat as Squeaky is going into the front.Squeaky turns around and gives him a tired look.I'll behave, Hiro says.Just one thing  I know.Don't fuck around with Raven.That's right.Squeaky holds his glare for another second and then turns around, motions the driver to drive.He impatiently rips ten feet of hard copy out of the dashboard printer and begins sifting through it.On this long strip of paper, Hiro glimpses multiple renditions of the important Crip, the guy with the goatee whom Raven was dealing with earlier.On the printout, he is labeled as T Bone Murphy.There's also a picture of Raven.It's an action shot, not a mug shot.It is terrible output.It has been caught through some kind of light amplifying optics that wash out the color and make everything incredibly grainy and low contrast.It looks like some image processing has been done to make it sharper; this also makes it grainier.The license plate is just an oblate blur, overwhelmed by the glow of the taillight.It is heeled over sharply, the sidecar wheel several inches off the ground.But the rider doesn't have any visible neck; his head, or rather the dark splotch that is there, just keeps getting wider until it merges into his shoulders.Definitely Raven.How come you have pictures of T Bone Murphy in there?Hiro says.He's chasing him, Squeaky says.Who's chasing whom?Well, your friend Y. T.  ain't no Edward R.  Murrow.But as far as we can tell from her reports, they've been sighted in the same area, trying to kill each other, Squeaky says.He's speaking with the slow, distant tones of someone who is getting live updates over his headphones.They were doing some kind of a deal earlier, Hiro says.Then I ain't hardly surprised they're trying to kill each other now.Once they get to a certain part of town, following the T Bone and Raven show becomes a matter of connect the ambulances.Every couple of blocks there is a cluster of cops and medics, lights sparkling, radios coughing.All they have to do is go from one to the next.At the first one, there is a dead Crip lying on the pavement.A six foot wide blood slick runs from his body, diagonally down the street to a storm drain.The ambulance people are standing around, smoking and drinking coffee from go cups, waiting for The Enforcers to get finished measuring and photographing so that they can haul the corpse to the morgue.There are no IV lines set up, no bits of medical trash strewn around the area, no open doc boxes; they didn't even try.They proceed around a couple of corners to the next constellation of flashing lights.Here, the ambulance drivers are inflating a cast around the leg of a MetaCop.Run over by the motorcycle, Squeaky says, shaking his head with the traditional Enforcer's disdain for their pathetic junior relations, the MetaCops.Finally, he patches the radio feed into the dashboard so they can all hear it.The motorcyclist's trail is now cold, and it sounds like most of the local cops are dealing with aftermath problems.But a citizen has just called in to complain that a man on a motorcycle, and several other persons, are trashing a field of hops on her block.Three blocks from here, Squeaky says to the driver.Hops?Hiro says.I know the place.Local microbrewery, Squeaky says.They grow their own hops.Contract it out to some urban gardeners.Chinese peasants who do the grunt work for 'em.When they arrive, the first authority figures on the scene, it is obvious why Raven decided to let himself get chased into a hop field: It is great cover.The hops are heavy, flowering vines that grow on trellises lashed together out of long bamboo poles.The trellises are eight feet high; you can't see a thing.They all get out of the car.T Bone?Squeaky hollers.They hear someone yelling in English from the middle of the field.Over here!But he isn't responding to Squeaky.They walk into the hop field.Carefully.There is an enveloping smell, a resiny odor not unlike marijuana, the sharp smell that comes off an expensive beer.Squeaky motions for Hiro to stay behind him.In other circumstances, Hiro would do so.He is half Japanese, and under certain circumstances, totally respectful of authority.This is not one of those circumstances.If Raven comes anywhere near Hiro, Hiro is going to be talking to him with his katana.And if it comes to that, Hiro doesn't want Squeaky anywhere near him, because he could lose a limb on the backswing.Yo, T Bone!Squeaky yells.It's The Enforcers, and we're pissed!Get the fuck out of there, man.Let's go home!T Bone, or Hiro assumes it is T Bone, responds only by firing a short burst from a machine pistol.The muzzle flash lights up the hop vines like a strobe light.Hiro aims one shoulder at the ground, buries himself in soft earth and foliage for a few seconds.Fuck!T Bone says.It is a disappointed fuck, but a fuck with a heavy undertone of overwhelming frustration and not a little fear.Hiro gets up into a conservative squat, looks around.Squeaky and the other Enforcer are nowhere to be seen.Hiro forces his way through one of the trellises and into a row that is closer to the action.The other Enforcerthe driveris in the same row, about ten meters away, his back turned to Hiro.He glances over his shoulder in Hiro's direction, then looks in the other direction and sees someone elseHiro can't quite see who, because The Enforcer is in the way.What the fuck, The Enforcer says.Then he jumps a little, as though startled, and something happens to the back of his jacket.Who is it?Hiro says.The Enforcer doesn't say anything.He is trying to turn back around, but something prevents it.Something is shaking the vines around him.The Enforcer shudders, careens sideways from foot to foot.Got to get loose, he says, speaking loudly to no one in particular.He breaks into a trot, running away from Hiro.The other person who was in the row is gone now.The Enforcer is running in a strange stiff upright gait with his arms down to his sides.His bright green windbreaker isn't hanging correctly.Hiro runs after him.The Enforcer is trotting toward the end of the row, where the lights of the street are visible.The Enforcer exits the field a couple of seconds ahead of him, and, when Hiro gets to the curb, is in the middle of the road, illuminated mostly by flashing blue light from a giant overhead video screen.He is turning around and around with strange little stomping footsteps, not keeping his balance very well.He is saying, Aaah, aaah in a low, calm voice that gurgles as though he badly needs to clear his throat.As The Enforcer revolves, Hiro perceives that he has been impaled on an eight foot long bamboo spear.Half sticks out the front, half out the back.The back half is dark with blood and black fecal clumps, the front half is greenish yellow and clean.The Enforcer can only see the front half and his hands are playing up and down it, trying to verify what his eyes are seeing.Then the back half whacks into a parked car, spraying a narrow fan of head cheese across the waxed and polished trunk lid.The car's alarm goes off.The Enforcer hears the sound and turns around to see what it is.When Hiro last sees him, he is running down the center of the pulsating neon street toward the center of Chinatown, wailing a terrible, random song that clashes with the bleating of the car alarm.Hiro feels even at this moment that something has been torn open in the world and that he is dangling above the gap, staring into a place where he does not want to be.Lost in the biomass.Hiro draws his katana.Squeaky!Hiro hollers.He's throwing spears!He's pretty good at it!Your driver is hit!Got it!Squeaky hollers.Hiro goes back into the closest row.He hears a sound off to the right and uses the katana to cut his way through into that row.This is not a nice place to be at the moment, but it is safer than standing in the street under the plutonic light of the video screen.Down the row is a man.Hiro recognizes him by the strange shape of his head, which just gets wider until it reaches his shoulders.He is holding a freshly cut bamboo pole in one hand, torn from the trellis.Raven strokes one end of it with his other hand, and a chunk falls off.Something flickers in that hand, the blade of a knife apparently.He has just cut off the end of the pole at an acute angle to make it into a spear.He throws it fluidly.The motion is calm and beautiful.The spear disappears because it is coming straight at Hiro.Hiro does not have time to adopt the proper stance, but this is fine since he has already adopted it.Whenever he has a katana in his hands he adopts it automatically, otherwise he fears that he may lose his balance and carelessly lop off one of his extremities.Feet parallel and pointed straight ahead, right foot in front of the left foot, katana held down at groin level like an extension of the phallus.Hiro raises the tip and slaps at the spear with the side of the blade, diverting it just enough; it goes into a slow sideways spin, the point missing Hiro just barely and entangling itself in a vine on Hiro's right.The butt end swings around and gets hung up on the left, tearing out a number of vines as it comes to a stop.It is heavy, and traveling very fast.Raven is gone.Mental note: Whether or not Raven intended to take on a bunch of Crips and Enforcers singlehandedly tonight, he didn't even bother to pack a gun.Another burst of gunfire sounds from several rows over.Hiro has been standing here for rather a long time, thinking about what just happened.He cuts through the next row of vines and heads in the direction of the muzzle flash, running his mouth: Don't shoot this way, T Bone, I'm on your side, man.Motherfucker threw a stick into my chest, man!T Bone complains.When you're wearing armor, getting hit by a spear just isn't such a big deal anymore.Maybe you should just forget it, Hiro says.He is having to cut his way through a lot of rows to reach T Bone, but as long as T Bone keeps talking, Hiro can find him.I'm a Crip.We don't forget nothing.T Bone says.Is that you?No, Hiro says.I'm not there yet.A very brief burst of gunfire, rapidly cut off.Suddenly, no one is talking.Hiro cuts his way into the next row and almost steps on T Bone's hand, which has been amputated at the wrist.Its finger is still tanged in the trigger guard of a MAC 11.The remainder of T Bone is two rows away.Hiro stops and watches through the vines.Raven is one of the largest men Hiro has seen outside of a professional sporting event.T Bone is backing away from him down the row.Raven, moving with long confident strides, catches up with T Bone and swings one hand up into T Bone's body; Hiro doesn't have to see the knife to know it is there.It looks as though T Bone is going to get out of this with nothing worse than a sewn on hand and some rehab work, because you can't stab a person to death that way, not if he is wearing armor.T Bone screams.He is bouncing up and down on Raven's hand.The knife has gone all the way through the bulletproof fabric and now Raven is trying to gut T Bone the same way he did Lagos.But his knifewhatever the hell it iswon't cut through the fabric that way.It is sharp enough to penetratewhich should be impossiblebut not sharp enough to slash.Raven pulls it out, drops to one knee, and swings his knife hand around in a long ellipse between T Bone's thighs.Then he jumps over T Bone's collapsing body and runs.Hiro gets the sense that T Bone is a dead man, so he follows Raven.His intention is not to hunt the man down, but rather to maintain a very clear picture of where he is.He has to cut through a number of rows.He rapidly loses Raven.He considers running as fast as he can in the opposite direction.Then he hears the deep, lung stretching rumble of a motorcycle engine.Hiro runs for the nearest street exit, just hoping to catch a glimpse.He does, though it is a quick one, not a hell of a lot better than the graphic in the cop car.Raven turns to look at Hiro, just as he is blowing out of there.He's right under a streetlight, so Hiro gets a clear look at his face for the first time.He is Asian.He has a wispy mustache that trails down past his chin.Another Crip comes running out into the street half a second after Hiro, as Raven is pulling away.He slows for a moment to take stock of the situation, then charges the motorcycle like a linebacker.He is crying out as he does so, a war cry.Squeaky emerges about the same time as the Crip, starts chasing both of them down the street.Raven seems to be unaware of the Crip running behind him, but in hindsight it seems apparent that he has been watching his approach in the rearview mirror of the motorcycle.As the Crip comes in range, Raven's hand lets go of the throttle for a moment, snaps back as if he is throwing away a piece of litter.His fist strikes the middle of the Crip's face like a frozen ham shot out of a cannon.The Crip's head snaps back, his feet are lifted off the ground, he does most of a backflip and strikes the pavement, hitting first with the nape of his neck, both arms slamming out straight onto the road as he does so.It looks a lot like a controlled fall, though if so, it has to be more reflex than anything.Squeaky decelerates, turns, and kneels down next to the fallen Crip, ignoring Raven.Hiro watches the large, radioactive, spear throwing killer drug lord ride his motorcycle into Chinatown.Which is the same as riding it into China, as far as chasing him down is concerned.He runs up to the Crip, who is lying crucified in the center of the street.The lower half of the Crip's face is pretty hard to make out.His eyes are half open, and he looks quite relaxed.He speaks quietly.He's a fucking Indian or something.Interesting idea.But Hiro still thinks he's Asian.What the fuck did you think you were doing, asshole?Squeaky says.He sounds so pissed that Hiro steps away from him.That fucker ripped us offthe suitcase burned, the Crip mumbles through a mashed jaw.So why didn't you just write it off?Are you crazy, fucking with Raven like that?He ripped us off.Nobody does that and lives.Well, Raven just did, Squeaky says.Finally, he's calming down a little.He rocks back on his heels, looks up at Hiro.T Bone and your driver are not likely to be alive, Hiro says.This guy better not movehe could have a neck fracture.He's lucky I don't fracture his fucking neck, Squeaky says.The ambulance people get there fast enough to slap an inflatable cervical collar around the Crip's neck before he gets ambitious enough to stand up.They haul him away within a few minutes.Hiro goes back into the hops and finds T Bone.T Bone is dead, slumped in a kneeling position against a trellis.The stab wound through his bulletproof vest probably would have been fatal, but Raven wasn't satisfied with that.He went down low and slashed up and down the insides of T Bone's thighs, which are now laid open all the way to the bone.In doing so, he put great length wise rents into both of T Bone's femoral arteries, and his entire blood supply dropped out of him.Like slicing the bottom off a styrofoam cup.20  The Enforcers turn the entire block into a mobile cop headquarters with cars and paddy wagons and satellite links on flatbed trucks.Dudes with white coats are walking up and down through the hop field with Geiger counters.Squeaky is wandering around with his headset, staring into space, carrying on conversations with people who aren't there.A tow truck shows up, towing T Bone's black BMW behind it.Yo, pod.Hiro turns around and looks.It's Y. T.  She's just come out of a Hunan place across the street.She hands Hiro a little white box and a pair of chopsticks.Spicy chicken with black bean sauce, no MSG.You know how to use chopsticks?Hiro shrugs off this insult.I got a double order, Y. T.  continues, cause I figure we got some good intel tonight.Are you aware of what happened here?No.I mean, some people obviously got hurt.But you weren't an eyewitness.No, I couldn't keep up with them.That's good, Hiro says.What did happen?Hiro just shakes his head.The spicy chicken is glistening darkly under the lights; he has never been less hungry in his life.If I had known, I wouldn't have gotten you involved.I just thought it was a surveillance job.What happened?I don't want to get into it.Look.Stay away from Raven, okay?Sure, she says.She says it in the chirpy tone of voice that she uses when she's lying and she wants to make sure you know it.Squeaky hauls open the back door of the BMW and looks into the back seat.Hiro steps a little closer, gets a nasty whiff of cold smoke.It is the smell of burnt plastic.The aluminum briefcase that Raven earlier gave to T Bone is sitting in the middle of the seat.It looks like it has been thrown into a fire; it has black smoke stains splaying out around the locks, and its plastic handle is partially melted.The buttery leather that covers the BMW's seats has burn marks on it.No wonder T Bone was pissed.Squeaky pulls on a pair of latex gloves.He hauls the briefcase out, sets it on the trunk lid, and rips the latches open with a small prybar.Whatever it is, it is complicated and highly designed.The top half of the case has several rows of the small red capped tubes that Hiro saw at the U Stor It.There are five rows with maybe twenty tubes in each row.The bottom half of the case appears to be some kind of miniaturized, old fashioned computer terminal.Most of it is occupied by a keyboard.There is a small liquid crystal display screen that can probably handle about five lines of text at a time.There is a penlike object attached to the case by a cable, maybe three feet long uncoiled.It looks like it might be a light pen or a bar code scanner.Above the keyboard is a lens, set at an angle so that it is aimed at whoever is typing on the keyboard.There are other features whose purpose is not so obvious: a slot, which might be a place to insert a credit or ID card, and a cylindrical socket that is about the size of one of those little tubes.This is Hiro's reconstruction of how the thing looked at one time.When Hiro sees it, it is melted together.Judging from the pattern of smoke marks on the outside of the casewhich appear to be jetting outward from the crack between the top and bottomthe source of the flame was inside, not outside.Squeaky reaches down and unsnaps one of the tubes from the bracket, holds it up in front of the bright lights of Chinatown.It had been transparent but was now smirched by heat and smoke.From a distance, it looks like a simple vial, but stepping up to look at it more closely Hiro can see at least half a dozen tiny individual compartments inside the thing, all connected to each other by capillary tubes.It has a red plastic cap on one end of it.The cap has a black rectangular window, and as Squeaky rotates it, Hiro can see the dark red glint of an inactive LED display inside, like looking at the display on a turned off calculator.Underneath this is a small perforation.It isn't just a simple drilled hole.It is wide at the surface, rapidly narrowing to a nearly invisible pinpoint opening, like the bell of a trumpet.The compartments inside the vial are all partially filled with liquids.Some of them are transparent and some are blackish brown.The brown ones have to be organics of some kind, now reduced by the heat into chicken soup.The transparent ones could be anything.He got out to go into a bar and have a drink, Squeaky mumbles.What an asshole.Who did?T Bone.See, T Bone was, like, the registered owner of this unit.The suitcase.And as soon as he got more than about ten feet away from itfooshit self destructed.Why?Squeaky looks at Hiro like he's stupid.Well, it's not like I work for Central Intelligence or anything.But I would guess that whoever makes this drugthey call it Countdown, or Redcap, or Snow Crashhas a real thing about trade secrets.So if the pusher abandons the suitcase, or loses it, or tries to transfer ownership to someone elsefoosh.You think the Crips are going to catch up with Raven?Not in Chinatown.Shit, Squeaky says, getting pissed again in retrospect, I can't believe that guy.I could have killed him.Raven?No.That Crip.Chasing Raven.He's lucky Raven got to him first, not me.You were chasing the Crip?Yeah, I was chasing the Crip.What, did you think I was trying to catch Raven?Sort of, yeah.I mean, he's the bad guy, right?Definitely.So I'd be chasing Raven if I was a cop and it was my job to catch bad guys.But I'm an Enforcer, and it's my job to enforce order.So I'm doing everything I canand so is every other Enforcer in townto protect Raven.And if you have any ideas about trying to go and find Raven yourself and get revenge for that colleague of yours that he offed, you can forget it.Offed?What colleague?Y. T.  breaks in.She didn't see what happened with Lagos.Hiro is mortified by this idea.Is that why everyone was telling me not to fuck with Raven?They were afraid I was going to attack him?Squeaky eyes the swords.You got the means.Why should anyone protect Raven?Squeaky smiles, as though we have just crossed the border into the realm of kidding around.He's a Sovereign.So declare war on him.It's not a good idea to declare war on a nuclear power.Huh?Christ, Squeaky says, shaking his head, if I had any idea how little you knew about this shit, I never would have let you into my car.I thought you were some kind of a serious CIC wet operations guy.Are you telling me you really didn't know about Raven?Yes, that's what I'm telling you.Okay.I'm gonna tell you this so you don't go out and cause any more trouble.Raven's packing a torpedo warhead that he boosted from an old Soviet nuke sub.It was a torpedo that was designed to take out a carrier battle group with one shot.A nuclear torpedo.You know that funny looking sidecar that Raven has on his Harley?Well, it's a hydrogen bomb, man.Armed and ready.The trigger's hooked up to EEG trodes embedded in his skull.If Raven dies, the bomb goes off.So when Raven comes into town, we do everything in our power to make the man feel welcome.Hiro's just gaping.Y. T.  has to step in on his behalf.Okay, she says.Speaking for my partner and myself, we'll stay away from him.21  Y. T.  reckons she is going to spend all afternoon being a ramp turd.The surf is always up on the Harbor Freeway, which gets her from Downtown into Compton, but the off ramps into that neighborhood are so rarely used that three foot tumbleweeds grow in their potholes.And she's definitely not going to travel into Compton under her own power.She wants to poon something big and fast.She can't use the standard trick of ordering a pizza to her destination and then pooning the delivery boy as he roars past, because none of the pizza chains deliver to this neighborhood.So she'll have to stop at the off ramp and wait hours and hours for a ride.A ramp turd.She does not want to do this delivery at all.But the franchisee wants her to do it bad.Really bad.The amount of money he has offered her is so high, it's stupid.The package must be full of some kind of intense new drug.But that's not as weird as what happens next.She is cruising down the Harbor Freeway, approaching the desired off ramp, having pooned a southbound semi.A quarter mile from the off ramp, a bullet pocked black Oldsmobile cruises past her, right turn signal flashing.He's going to exit.It's too good to be true.She poons the Oldsmobile.As she cruises down the ramp behind this flatulent sedan, she checks out the driver in his rearview mirror.It is the franchisee himself, the one who is paying her a totally stupid amount of money to do this job.By this point, she's more afraid of him than she is of Compton.He must be a psycho.He must be in love with her.This is all a twisted psycho love plot.But it's a little late now.She stays with him, looking for a way out of this burning and rotting neighborhood.They are approaching a big, nasty looking Mafia roadblock.He guns the gas pedal, headed straight for death.She can see the destination franchise ahead.At the last second, he whips the car around and squeals sideways to a halt.He couldn't have been more helpful.She unpoons as he's giving her this last little kick of energy and sails through the checkpoint at a safe and sane speed.The guards keep their guns pointed at the sky, swivel their heads to look at her butt as she rolls past them.The Compton Nova Sicilia franchise is a grisly scene.It is a jamboree of Young Mafia.These youths are even duller than the ones from the all Mormon Deseret Burbclave.The boys are wearing tedious black suits.The girls are encrusted with pointless femininity.Girls can't even be in the Young Mafia; they have to be in the Girls' Auxiliary and serve macaroons on silver plates.Girls is too fine a word for these organisms, too high up the evolutionary scale.They aren't even chicks.She's going way too fast, so she kicks the board around sideways, plants pads, leans into it, skids to a halt, roiling up a wave of dust and grit that dulls the glossy shoes of several Young Mafia who are milling out front, nibbling dinky Italo treats and playing grown up.It condenses on the white lace stockings of the Young Mafia proto chicks.She falls off the board, appearing to catch her balance at the last moment.She stomps on the edge of the plank with one foot, and it bounces four feet into the air, spinning rapidly around its long axis, up into her armpit, where she clamps it tight under one arm.The spokes of the smartwheels all retract so that the wheels are barely larger than their hubs.She slaps the Magna Poon into a handy socket on the bottom of the plank so that her gear is all in one handy package.Y. T. , she says.Young, fast, and female.Where the fuck's Enzo?The boys decide to get all mature on Y. T.  Males of this age are preoccupied with snapping each other's underwear and drinking until they are in a coma.But around a female, they do the mature thing.It is hilarious.One of them steps forward slightly, interposing himself between Y. T.  and the nearest proto chick.Welcome to Nova Sicilia, he says.Can I assist you in some way?Y. T.  sighs deeply.She is a fully independent businessperson, and these people are trying to do a peer thing on her.Delivery for one Enzo?Y'know, I can't wait to get out of this neighborhood.It's a good neighborhood, now, the YoMa says.You should stick around for a few minutes.Maybe you could learn some manners.You should try surfing the Ventura at rush hour.Maybe you could learn your limitations.The YoMa laughs like, okay, if that's how you want it.He gestures toward the door.The man you want to talk to is in there.Whether he wants to talk to you or not, I'm not sure.He fucking asked for me, Y. T.  says.He came across the country to be with us, the guy says, and he seems pretty happy with us.All the other YoMas mumble and nod supportively.Then why are you standing outside?Y. T.  asks, going inside.Inside the franchise, things are startlingly relaxed.Uncle Enzo is in there, looking just like he does in the pictures, except bigger than Y. T.  expected.He is sitting at a desk playing cards with some other guys in funeral garb.He is smoking a cigar and nursing an espresso.Can't get too much stimulation, apparently.There's a whole Uncle Enzo portable support system in here.A traveling espresso machine has been set up on another desk.A cabinet sits next to it, doors open to reveal a big foil bag of Italian Roast Water Process Decaf and a box of Havana cigars.There's also a gargoyle in one corner, patched into a bigger than normal laptop, mumbling to himself.Y. T.  lifts her arm, allows the plank to fall into her hand.She slaps it down on top of an empty desk and approaches Uncle Enzo, unslinging the delivery from her shoulder.Gino, please, Uncle Enzo says, nodding at the delivery.Gino steps forward to take it from her.Need your signature on that, Y. T.  says.For some reason she does not refer to him as pal or bub.She's momentarily distracted by Gino.Suddenly, Uncle Enzo has come rather close to her, caught her right hand in his left hand.Her Kourier gloves have an opening on the back of the hand just big enough for his lips.He plants a kiss on Y. T.'s hand.It's warm and wet.Not slobbery and gross, not antiseptic and dry either.Interesting.The guy has confidence going for him.Christ, he's slick.Nice lips.Sort of firm muscular lips, not gelatinous and blubbery like fifteen year old lips can be.Uncle Enzo has a very faint citrus and aged tobacco smell to him.Fully smelling it would involve standing pretty close to him.He is towering over her, standing at a respectable distance now, glinting at her through crinkly old guy eyes.Seems pretty nice.I can't tell you how much I've been looking forward to meeting you, Y. T. , he says.Hi, she says.Her voice sounds chirpier than she likes it to be.So she adds, What's in that bag that's so fucking valuable, anyway?Absolutely nothing, Uncle Enzo says.His smile is not exactly smug.More embarrassed, like what an awkward way to meet someone.It all has to do with imageering, he says, spreading one hand dismissively.There are not many ways for a man like me to meet with a young girl that do not generate incorrect images in the media.It's stupid.But we pay attention to these things.So, what did you want to meet with me about?Got a delivery for me to make?All the guys in the room laugh.The sound startles Y. T.  a little, reminds her that she is performing in front of a crowd.Her eyes flick away from Uncle Enzo for a moment.Uncle Enzo notices this.His smile gets infinitesimally narrower, and he hesitates for a moment.In that moment, all the other guys in the room stand up and head for the exit.You may not believe me, he says, but I simply wanted to thank you for delivering that pizza a few weeks ago.Why shouldn't I believe you?she asks.She is amazed to hear nice, sweet things coming out of her mouth.So is Uncle Enzo.I'm sure you of all people can come up with a reason.So, she says, you having a nice day with all the Young Mafia?Uncle Enzo gives her a look that says, watch it, child.A second after she gets scared, she starts laughing, because it's a put on, he's just giving her a hard time.He smiles, indicating that it's okay for her to laugh.Y. T.  can't remember when she's been so involved in a conversation.Why can't all people be like Uncle Enzo?Let me see, Uncle Enzo says, looking at the ceiling, scanning his memory banks.I know a few things about you.That you are fifteen years old, you live in a Burbclave in the Valley with your mother.I know a few things about you, too, Y. T.  hazards.Uncle Enzo laughs.Not nearly as much as you think, I promise.Tell me, what does your mother think of your career?Nice of him to use the word career.She's not totally aware of itor doesn't want to know.You're probably wrong, Uncle Enzo says.He says it cheerfully enough, not trying to cut her down or anything.You might be shocked at how well informed she is.This is my experience, anyway.What does your mother do for a living?She works for the Feds.Uncle Enzo finds that richly amusing.And her daughter is delivering pizzas for Nova Sicilia.What does she do for the Feds?Some kind of thing where she can't really tell me in case I blab it.She has to take a lot of polygraph tests.Uncle Enzo seems to understand this very well.Yes, a lot of Fed jobs are that way.There is an opportune silence.It kind of freaks me out, Y. T.  says.The fact that she works for the Feds?The polygraph tests.They put a thing around her armto measure the blood pressure.A sphygmomanometer, Uncle Enzo says crisply.It leaves a bruise around her arm.For some reason, that kind of bothers me.It should bother you.And the house is bugged.So when I'm homeno matter what I'm doingsomeone else is probably listening.Well, I can certainly relate to that, Uncle Enzo says.They both laugh.I'm going to ask you a question that I've always wanted to ask a Kourier, Uncle Enzo says.I always watch you people through the windows of my limousine.In fact, when a Kourier poons me, I always tell Peter, my driver, not to give them a hard time.My question is, you are covered from head to toe in protective padding.So why don't you wear a helmet?The suit's got a cervical airbag that blows up when you fall off the board, so you can bounce on your head.Besides, helmets feel weird.They say it doesn't affect your hearing, but it does.You use your hearing quite a bit in your line of work?Definitely, yeah.Uncle Enzo is nodding.That's what I suspected.We felt the same way, the boys in my unit in Vietnam.I heard you went to Vietnam, but She stops, sensing danger.You thought it was hype.No, I went there.Could have stayed out, if I'd wanted.But I volunteered.You volunteered to go to Vietnam?Uncle Enzo laughs.Yes, I did.The only boy in my family to do so.Why?I thought it would be safer than Brooklyn.Y. T.  laughs.A bad joke, he says.I volunteered because my father didn't want me to.And I wanted to piss him off.Really?Definitely.I spent years and years finding ways to piss him off.Dated black girls.Grew my hair long.Smoked marijuana.But the capstone, my ultimate achievementeven better than having my ear piercedwas volunteering for service in Vietnam.But I had to take extreme measures even then.Y. T.'s eyes dart back and forth between Uncle Enzo's creased and leathery earlobes.In the left one she just barely sees a tiny diamond stud.What do you mean, extreme measures?Everyone knew who I was.Word gets around, you know.If I had volunteered for the regular Army, I would have ended up stateside, filling out formsmaybe even at Fort Hamilton, right there in Bensonhurst.To prevent that, I volunteered for Special Forces, did everything I could to get into a front line unit.He laughs.And it worked.Anyway, I'm rambling like an old man.I was trying to make a point about helmets.Oh, yeah.Our job was to go through the jungle making trouble for some slippery gentlemen carrying guns bigger than they were.Stealthy guys.And we depended on our hearing, toojust like you do.And you know what?We never wore helmets.Same reason.Exactly.Even though they didn't cover the ears, really, they did something to your sense of hearing.I still think I owe my life to going bareheaded.That's really cool.That's really interesting.You'd think they would have solved the problem by now.Yeah, Y. T.  volunteers, some things never change, I guess.Uncle Enzo throws back his head and belly laughs.Usually, Y. T.  finds this kind of thing pretty annoying, but Uncle Enzo just seems like he's having a good time, not putting her down.Y. T.  wants to ask him how he went from the ultimate rebellion to running the family beeswax.She doesn't.But Uncle Enzo senses that it is the next, natural subject of the conversation.Sometimes I wonder who'll come after me, he says.Oh, we have plenty of excellent people in the next generation.But after thatwell, I don't know.I guess all old people feel like the world is coming to an end.You got millions of those Young Mafia types, Y. T.  says.All destined to wear blazers and shuffle papers in suburbia.You don't respect those people very much, Y. T. , because you're young and arrogant.But I don't respect them much either, because I'm old and wise.This is a fairly shocking thing for Uncle Enzo to be saying, but Y. T.  doesn't feel shocked.It just seems like a reasonable statement coming from her reasonable pal, Uncle Enzo.None of them would ever volunteer to go get his legs shot off in the jungle, just to piss off his old man.They lack a certain fiber.They are lifeless and beaten down.That's sad, Y. T.  says.It feels better to say this than to trash them, which was her first inclination.Well, says Uncle Enzo.It is the well that begins the end of a conversation.I was going to send you some roses, but you wouldn't really be interested in that, would you?Oh, I wouldn't mind, she says, sounding pathetically weak to herself.Here's something better, since we are comrades in arms, he says.He loosens his tie and collar, reaches down into his shirt, pulls out an amazingly cheap steel chain with a couple of stamped silver tags dangling from it.These are my old dog tags, he says.Been carrying them around for years, just for the hell of it.I would be amused if you would wear them.Trying to keep her knees steady, she puts the dog tags on.They dangle down onto her coverall.Better put them inside, Uncle Enzo says.She drops them down into the secret place between her breasts.They are still warm from Uncle Enzo.Thanks.It's just for fun, he says, but if you ever get into trouble, and you show those dog tags to whoever it is that's giving you a bad time, then things will probably change very quickly.Thanks, Uncle Enzo.Take care of yourself.Be good to your mother.She loves you.22  As she steps out of the Nova Sicilia franchulate, a guy is waiting for her.He smiles, not without irony, and makes just a hint of a bow, sort of to get her attention.It's pretty ridiculous, but after being with Uncle Enzo for a while, she's definitely into it.So she doesn't laugh in his face or anything, just looks the other way and blows him off.Y. T.  Got a job for ya, he says.I'm busy, she says, got other deliveries to make.You lie like a mattress, he says appreciatively.Y'know that gargoyle in there?He's patched in to the RadiKS computer even as we speak.So we all know for a fact you don't got no jobs to do.Well, I can't take jobs from a customer, Y. T.  says.We're centrally dispatched.You have to go through the 1 800 number.Jeez, what kind of a fucking dickhead do you think I am?the guy says.Y. T.  stops walking, turns, finally looks at the guy.He's tall, lean.Black suit, black hair.And he's got a gnarly looking glass eye.What happened to your eye?she says.Ice pick, Bayonne, 1985, he says.Any other questions?Sorry, man, I was just asking.Now back to business.Because I don't have my head totally up my asshole, like you seem to assume, I am aware that all Kouriers are centrally dispatched through the 1 800 number.Now, we don't like 1 800 numbers and central dispatching.It's just a thing with us.We like to go person to person, the old fashioned way.Like, on my momma's birthday, I don't pick up the phone and dial 1 800 CALL MOM.I go there in person and give her a kiss on the cheek, okay?Now in this case, we want you in particular.How come?Because we just love to deal with difficult little chicks who ask too many fucking questions.So our gargoyle has already patched himself in to the computer that RadiKS uses to dispatch Kouriers.The man with the glass eye turns, rotating his head way, way around like an owl, and nods in the direction of the gargoyle.A second later, Y. T.'s personal phone rings.Fucking pick it up, he says.What?she says into the phone.A computer voice tells her that she is supposed to make a pickup in Griffith Park and deliver it to a Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise in Van Nuys.If you want something delivered from point A to point B, why don't you just drive it down there yourselves?Y. T.  asks.Put it in one of those black Lincoln Town Cars and just get it done.Because in this case, the something doesn't exactly belong to us, and the people at point A and point B, well, we aren't necessarily on the best of terms, mutually speaking.You want me to steal something, Y. T.  says.The man with the glass eye is pained, wounded.No, no, no.Kid, listen.We're the fucking Mafia.We want to steal something, we already know how to do that, okay?We don't need a fifteen year old girl's help to get something stolen.What we are doing here is more of a covert operation.A spy thing.Intel.Yeah.A spy thing, the man says, his tone of voice suggesting that he is trying to humor someone.And the only way to get this operation to work is if we have a Kourier who can cooperate with us a little bit.So all that stuff with Uncle Enzo was fake, Y. T.  says.You're just trying to get all friendly with a Kourier.Oh, ho, listen to this, says the man with the glass eye, genuinely amused.Yeah, like we have to go all the way to the top to impress a fifteen year old.Look, kid, there's a million Kouriers out there we could bribe to do this.We're going with you, again, because you have a personal relationship with our outfit.Well, what do you want me to do?Exactly what you would normally do at this juncture, the man says.Go to Griffith Park and make the pickup.That's it?Yeah.Then make the delivery.But do us a favor and take I 5, okay?That's not the best way to do it  Do it anyway.Okay.Now come on, we'll give you an escort out of this hellhole.Sometimes, if the wind is going the right way, and you get into the pocket of air behind a speeding eighteen wheeler, you don't even have to poon it.The vacuum, like a mighty hoover, sucks you in.You can stay there all day.But if you screw up, you suddenly find yourself alone and powerless in the left lane of a highway with a convoy of semis right behind you: Just as bad, if you give in to its power, it will suck you right into its mudflaps, you will become axle dressing, and no one will ever know.This is called the Magic Hoover Poon.It reminds Y. T.  of the way her life has been since the fateful night of the Hiro Protagonist pizza adventure.Her poon cannot miss as she slingshots her way up the San Diego Freeway.She can get a solid yank off even the lightest, trashiest plastic and aluminum Chinese econobox.People don't fuck with her.She has established her space on the pavement.She is going to get so much business now.She will have to sub a lot of work out to Roadkill.And sometimes, just to make important business arrangements, they will have to check into a motel somewherewhich is exactly what real business people do.Lately, Y. T.  has been trying to teach Roadkill how to give her a massage.But Roadkill can never get past her shoulder blades before he loses it and starts being Mr.Macho.Which anyway is kind of sweet.And anyway, you take what you can get.This is not the most direct route to Griffith Park by a longshot, but this is what the Mafia wants her to do: Take 405 all the way up into the Valley, and then approach from that direction, which is the direction she'd normally come from.They're so paranoid.So professional.LAX goes by on her left.On her right, she gets a glimpse of the U Stor It where that dweeb, her partner, is probably goggled into his computer.She weaves through complex traffic flows around Hughes Airport, which is now a private outpost of Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.Continues past the Santa Monica Airport, which just got bought out by Admiral Bob's Global Security.Cuts through the middle of Fedland, where her mother goes to work every day.Fedland used to be the VA Hospital and a bunch of other Federal buildings; now it has condensed into a kid ney shaped lozenge that wraps around 405.It has a barrier around it, a perimeter fence put up by stringing chain link fabric, concertina wire, heaps of rubble, and Jersey barriers from one building to the next.All of the buildings in Fedland are big and ugly.Human beings mill around their plinths, wearing wool clothing the color of damp granite.They are scrawny and dark underneath the white majesty of the buildings.On the far side of the Fedland barrier, off to the right, she can see UCLA, which is now being jointly run by the Japanese and Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong and a few big American corporations.People say that over there to the left, in Pacific Palisades, is a big building above the ocean where the Central Intelligence Corporation has its West Coast headquarters.Soonlike maybe tomorrowshe'll go up there, find that building, maybe just cruise past it and wave.She has great stuff to tell Hiro now.Great intel on Uncle Enzo.People would pay millions for it.But in her heart, she's already feeling the pangs of conscience.She knows that she cannot kiss and tell on the Mafia.Not because she's afraid of them.Because they trust her.They were nice to her.And who knows, it might turn into something.A better career than she could get with CIC.Not many cars are taking the off ramp into Fedland.Her mother does it every morning, as do a bunch of other Feds.But all Feds go to work early and stay late.It's a loyalty thing with them.The Feds have a fetish for loyaltysince they don't make a lot of money or get a lot of respect, you have to prove you're personally committed and that you don't care about those trappings.Case in point: Y. T.  has been pooned onto the same cab all the way from LAX.It's got an Arab in the back seat.His burnous flutters in the wind from the open window; the air conditioning doesn't work, an L. A.  cabbie doesn't make enough money to buy ChillFreonon the underground market.This is typical: only the Feds would make a visitor take a dirty, un air conditioned cab.Sure enough, the cab pulls onto the ramp marked UNITED STATES.Y. T.  disengages and slaps her poon onto a Valley bound delivery truck.On top of the huge Federal Building, a bunch of Feds with walkie talkies and dark glasses and FEDS windbreakers lurk, aiming long lenses into the windshields of the vehicles coming up Wilshire Boulevard.If this were nighttime, she'd probably see a laser scanner playing over the bar code license plate of the taxi as it veers onto the U. S.  exit.Y. T.'s mom has told her all about these guys.They are the Executive Branch General Operational Command, EBGOC.The FBI, Federal Marshalls, Secret Service, and Special Forces all claim some separate identity still, like the Army, Navy, and Air Force used to, but they're all under the command of EBGOC, they all do the same things, and they are more or less interchangeable.Outside of Fedland, everyone just knows them as the Feds.EBGOC claims the right to go anywhere, anytime, within the original borders of the United States of America, without a warrant or even a good excuse.But they only really feel at home here, in Fedland, staring down the barrel of a telephoto lens, shotgun microphone, or sniper rifle.The longer the better.Down below them, the taxicab with the Arab in the back slows down to sublight speed and winds its way down a twisting slalom course of Jersey barriers with .50 caliber machine gun nests strategically placed here and there.It comes to a stop in front of an STD device, straddling an open pit where EBGOC boys stand with dogs and high powered spotlights to look up its skirt for bombs or NBCI (nuclear biological chemical informational) agents in the undercarriage.Meanwhile, the driver gets out and pops the hood and trunk so that more Feds can inspect them; another Fed leans against the window next to the Arab and grills him through the window.They say that in D. C. , all the museums and the monuments have been concessioned out and turned into a tourist park that now generates about 10 percent of the Government's revenue.The Feds could run the concession themselves and probably keep more of the gross, but that's not the point.It's a philosophical thing.A back to basics thing.Government should govern.It's not in the entertainment industry, is it?Leave entertaining to Industry weirdospeople who majored in tap dancing.Feds aren't like that.Feds are serious people.Poli sci majors.Student council presidents.Debate club chairpersons.The kinds of people who have the grit to wear a dark wool suit and a tightly buttoned collar even when the temperature has greenhoused up to a hundred and ten degrees and the humidity is thick enough to stall a jumbo jet.The kinds of people who feel most at home on the dark side of a one way mirror.23  Sometimes, to prove their manhood, boys of about Y. T.'s age will drive to the eastern end of the Hollywood Hills, into Griffith Park, pick the road of their choosing, and simply drive through it.Making it through there unscathed is a lot like counting coup on a High Plains battlefield; simply having come that close to danger makes you more of a man.By definition, all they ever see are the through streets.If you are driving into Griffith Park for some highjinks and you see a NO OUTLET sign, you know that it is time to shift your dad's Accord into reverse and drive it backward all the way back home, revving the engine way past the end of the tachometer.Naturally, as soon as Y. T.  enters the park, following the road she was told to follow, she sees a NO OUTLET sign.Y. T.'s not the first Kourier to take a job like this, and so she has heard about the place she is going.It is a narrow canyon, accessed only by this one road, and down in the bottom of the canyon a new gang lives.Everyone calls them the Falabalas, because that's how they talk to each other.They have their own language and it sounds like babble.Right now, the important thing is not to think about how stupid this is.Making the right decision is, priority wise, down there along with getting enough niacin and writing a thank you letter to grandma for the nice pearl earrings.The only important thing is not to back down.A row of machine gun nests marks the border of Falabala territory.It seems like overkill to Y. T.  But then she's never been in a conflict with the Mafia, either.She plays it cool, idles toward the barrier at maybe ten miles an hour.This is where she'll freak out and get scared if she's going to.She is holding aloft a color faxed RadiKS document, featuring the cybernetic radish logo, proclaiming that she really is here to pick up an important delivery, honest.It'll never work with these guys.But it does.A big gnarled up coil of razor ribbon is pulled out of her way, just like that, and she glides through without slowing down.And that's when she knows that it's going to be fine.These people are just doing business here, just like anyone else.She doesn't have to skate far into the canyon.Thank God.She goes around a few turns, into kind of an open flat area surrounded by trees, and finds herself in what looks like an open air insane asylum.Or a Moonie festival or something.A couple of dozen people are here.None of them have been taking care of themselves at all.They are all wearing the ragged remains of what used to be pretty decent clothing.Half a dozen of them are kneeling on the pavement with their hands clenched tightly together, mumbling to unseen entities.On the trunk lid of a dead car, they've set up an old junked computer terminal, just a dark monitor screen with a big spider web crack in it, like someone bounced a coffee mug off the glass.A fat man with red suspenders dangling around his knees is sliding his hands up and down the keyboard, whacking the keys randomly, talking out loud in a meaningless babble.A couple of the others stand behind him, peeking over his shoulder and around his body, and sometimes they try to horn in on it, but he shoves them out of the way.There's also a crowd of people clapping their hands, swaying their bodies, and singing The Happy Wanderer.They're really into it, too.Y. T.  hasn't seen such childlike glee on anyone's face since the first time she let Roadkill take her clothes off.But this is a different kind of childlike glee that does not look right on a bunch of thirty something people with dirty hair.And finally, there is a guy that Y. T.  dubs the High Priest.He's wearing a formerly white lab coat, bearing the logo of some company in the Bay Area.He's sacked out in the back of a dead station wagon, but when Y. T.  enters the area he jumps up and runs toward her in a way that she can't help but find a little threatening.But compared to these others, he seems almost like a regular, healthy, fit, demented bush dwelling psychotic.You're here to pick up a suitcase, right?I'm here to pick up something.I don't know what it is, she says.He goes over to one of the dead cars, unlocks the hood, pulls out an aluminum briefcase.It looks exactly like the one that Squeaky took out of the BMW last night.Here's your delivery, he says, striding toward her.She backs away from him instinctively.I understand, I understand, he says.I'm a scary creep.He puts it on the ground, puts his foot on it, gives it a shove.It slides across the pavement to Y. T. , bouncing off the occasional rock.There's no big hurry on this delivery, he says.Would you like to stay and have a drink?We've got Kool Aid.I'd love to, Y. T.  says, but my diabetes is acting up real bad.Well, then you can just stay and be a guest of our community.We have a lot of wonderful things to tell you about.Things that could really change your life.Do you have anything in writing?Something I could take with me?Gee, I'm afraid we don't.Why don't you stay.You seem like a really nice person.Sorry, Jack, but you must be confusing me with a bimbo, Y. T.  says.Thanks for the suitcase.I'm out of here.Y. T.  starts digging at the pavement with one foot, building up speed as fast as she can.On her way out, she passes by a young woman with a shaved head, dressed in the dirty and haggard remains of a Chanel knockoff.As Y. T.  goes by her, she smiles vacantly, sticks out her hand, and waves.Hi, she says.ba ma zu na la amu pa go lu ne me a ba du.Yo, Y. T.  says.A couple of minutes later, she's pooning her way up I 5, headed up into Valley land.She's a little freaked out, her timing is off, she's taking it easy.A tune keeps running through her head: The Happy Wanderer.It's driving her crazy.A large black blur keeps pulling alongside her.It would be a tempting target, so large and ferrous, if it were going a little faster.But she can make better time than this barge, even when she's taking it slow.The driver's side window of the black car rolls down.It's the guy.Jason.He's sticking his whole head out the window to look back at her, driving blind.The wind at fifty miles per hour does not ruffle his firmly gelled razor cut.He smiles.He has an imploring look about him, the same look that Roadkill gets.He points suggestively at his rear quarter panel.What the hell.The last time she pooned this guy, he took her exactly where she was going.Y. T.  detaches from the Acura she's been hitched to for the last half mile, swings it over to Jason's fat Olds.And Jason takes her off the freeway and onto Victory Boulevard, headed for Van Nuys, which is exactly right.But after a couple of miles, he swings the wheel sharply right and screeches into the parking lot of a ghost mall, which is wrong.Right now, nothing's parked in the lot but an eighteen wheeler, motor running, SALDUCCI BROS.MOVING & STORAGE painted on the sides.Come on, Jason says, getting out of his Oldsmobile.You don't want to waste any time.Screw you, asshole, she says, reeling in her poon, looking back toward the boulevard for some promising westbound traffic.Whatever this guy has in mind, it is probably unprofessional.Young lady, says another voice, an older and more arresting sort of voice, it's fine if you don't like Jason.But your pal, Uncle Enzo, needs your help.A door on the back of the semi has opened up.A man in a black suit is standing there.Behind him, the interior of the semi is brightly lit up.Halogen light glares off the man's slick hairdo.Even with this backlighting, she can tell it is the man with the glass eye.What do you want?she says.What I want, he says, looking her up and down, and what I need are different things.Right now I'm working, see, which means that what I want is not important.What I need is for you to get into this truck along with your skateboard and that suitcase.Then he adds, Am I getting through to you?He asks the question almost rhetorically, like he presumes the answer is no.He's for real, Jason says, as though Y. T.  must be hanging on his opinion.Well, there you have it, the man with the glass eye says.Y. T.  is supposed to be on her way to a Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise.If she screws up this delivery, that means she's double crossing God, who may or may not exist, and in any case who is capable of forgiveness.The Mafia definitely exists and hews to a higher standard of obedience.She hands her stuffthe plank and the aluminum caseup to the man with the glass eye, then vaults up into the back of the semi, ignoring his proffered hand.He recoils, holds up his hand, looks at it to see if there's something wrong with it.By the time her feet leave the ground, the truck is already moving.By the time the door is pulled shut behind her, they have already pulled onto the boulevard.Just gotta run a few tests on this delivery of yours, the man with the glass eye says.Ever think of introducing yourself?Y. T.  says.Nah, he says, people always forget names.You can just think of me as that one guy, y'know?Y. T.  is not really listening.She is checking out the inside of the truck.The trailer of this rig consists of a single long skinny room.Y. T.  has just come in through its only entrance.At this end of the room, a couple of Mafia guys are lounging around, the way they always do.Most of the room is taken up by electronics.Big electronics.Going to just do some computer stuff, y'know, he says, handing the briefcase over to a computer guy.Y. T.  knows he's a computer guy because he has long hair in a ponytail and he's wearing jeans and he seems gentle.Hey, if anything happens to that, my ass is grass, Y. T.  says.She's trying to sound tough and brave, but it's a hollow act in these circumstances.The man with the glass eye is, like, shocked.What do you think I am, some kind of incredibly stupid dick head?he says.Shit, that's just what I need, trying to explain to Uncle Enzo how I managed to get his little bunny rabbit shot in the kneecaps.It's a noninvasive procedure, the computer guy says in a placid, liquid voice.The computer guy rotates the case around in his hand a few times, just to get a feel for it.Then he slides it into a large open ended cylinder that is resting on the top of a table.The walls of the cylinder are a couple of inches thick.Frost appears to be growing on this thing.Mystery gases continuously slide off of it, like teaspoons of milk dropped into turbulent water.The gases plunge out across the table and drop to the floor, where they make a little carpet of fog that flows and blooms around their shoes.When the computer guy has it in place, he yanks his hand back from the cold.Then he puts on a pair of computer goggles.That's all there is to it.He just sits there for a few minutes.Y. T.  is not a computer person, but she knows that somewhere behind the cabinets and doors in the back of this truck there is a big computer doing a lot of things right now.It's like a CAT scanner, the man with the glass eye says, using the same hushed tone of voice as a sports caster in a golfing tournament.But it reads everything, you know, he says, rotating his hands impatiently in all encompassing circles.How much does it cost?I don't know.What's it called?Doesn't really have a name yet.Well, who makes it?We made the goddamn thing, the man with the glass eye says.Just, like in the last couple weeks.What for?You're asking too many questions.Look.You're a cute kid.I mean, you're a hell of a chick.You're a knockout.But don't go thinking you're too important at this stage.At this stage.Hmm.24  Hiro is in his 20 by 30 at the U Stor It.He is spending a little time in Reality, as per the suggestion of his partner.The door is open so that ocean breezes and jet exhaust can blow through.All the furniturethe futons, the cargo pallet, the experimental cinderblock furniturehas been pushed up against the walls.He is holding a one meter long piece of heavy rebar with tape wrapped around one end to make a handle.The rebar approximates a katana, but it is very much heavier.He calls it redneck katana.He is in the kendo stance, barefoot.He should be wearing voluminous ankle length culottes and a heavy indigo tunic, which is the traditional uniform, but instead he is wearing jockey shorts.Sweat is running down his smoothly muscled cappuccino back and exploring his cleavage.Blisters the size of green grapes are forming on the ball of his left foot.Hiro's heart and lungs are well developed, and he has been blessed with unusually quick reflexes, but he is not intrinsically strong, the way his father was.Even if he were intrinsically strong, working with the redneck katana would be very difficult.He is full of adrenaline, his nerves are shot, and his mind is cluttered up with free floating anxietyfloating around on an ocean of generalized terror.He is shuffling back and forth down the thirty foot axis of the room.From time to time he will accelerate, raise the redneck katana up over his head until it is pointed backward, then bring it swiftly down, snapping his wrists at the last moment so that it comes to a stop in midair.Then he says, Next!Theoretically.In fact, the redneck katana is difficult to stop once it gets moving.But it's good exercise.His forearms look like bundles of steel cables.Almost.Well, they will soon, anyway.The Nipponese don't go in for this nonsense about follow through.If you strike a man on the top of his head with a katana and do not make any effort to stop the blade, it will divide his skull and probably get hung up in his collarbone or his pelvis, and then you will be out there in the middle of the medieval battlefield with a foot on your late opponent's face, trying to work the blade loose as his best friend comes running up to you with a certain vengeful gleam in his eye.So the plan is to snap the blade to a full stop just after the impact, maybe crease his brain pan an inch or two, then whip it out and look for another samurai, hence: Next!He has been thinking about what happened earlier tonight with Raven, which pretty much rules out sleep, and this is why he is practicing with the redneck katana at three in the morning.He knows he was totally unprepared.The spear just came at him.He slapped at it with the blade.He happened to slap it at the right time, and it missed him.But he did this almost absentmindedly.Maybe that's how great warriors do it.Carelessly, not wracking their minds with the consequences.Maybe he's flattering himself.The sound of a helicopter has been getting louder for some minutes now.Even though Hiro lives right next to the airport, this is unusual.They're not supposed to fly right near LAX, it raises evident safety questions.It doesn't stop getting louder until it is very loud, and at that point, the helicopter is hovering a few feet above the parking lot, right out in front of Hiro and Vitaly's 20 by 30.It's a nice one, a corporate jet chopper, dark green, with subdued markings.Hiro suspects that in brighter light, he would be able to make out the logo of a defense contractor, most likely General Jim's Defense System.A pale faced white man with a very high forehead cum bald spot jumps out of the chopper, looking a lot more athletic than his face and general demeanor would lead you to expect, and jogs across the parking lot directly toward Hiro.This is the kind of guy Hiro remembers from when his dad was in the Armynot the gristly veterans of legends and movies, just sort of regular thirty five year old guys rattling around in bulky uniforms.He's a major.His name, sewn onto his BDUs, is Clem.Hiro Protagonist?The same.Juanita sent me to pick you up.She said you'd recognize the name.I recognize the name.But I don't really work for Juanita.She says you do now.Well, that's nice, Hiro says.So I guess it's kind of urgent?I think that would be a fair assumption, Major Clem says.Can I spare a few minutes?Because I've been working out, and I need to run next door.Major Clem looks next door.The next logo down the strip is THE REST STOP.The situation is fairly static.You could spare five minutes, Major Clem says.Hiro has an account with The Rest Stop.To live at the U Stor It, you sort of have to have an account.So he gets to bypass the front office where the attendant waits by the cash register.He shoves his membership card into a slot, and a computer screen lights up with three choices:    M  F  NURSERY (UNISEX)    Hiro slaps the M button.Then the screen changes to a menu of four choices:    OUR SPECIAL LIMITED FACILITIES  THRIFTY BUT SANITARY  STANDARD FACILITIESJUST LIKE  HOMEMAYBE JUST A LITTLE BETTER  PRIME FACILITIESA GRACIOUS PLACE  FOR THE DISCRIMINATING PATRON  THE LAVATORY GRANDE ROYALE    He has to override a well worn reflex to stop himself from automatically punching SPECIAL LIMITED FACILITIES, which is what he and all the other U Stor It residents always use.Almost impossible to go in there and not come in contact with someone else's bodily fluids.Not a pretty sight.Not at all gracious.Insteadwhat the fuck, Juanita's going to hire him, right?he slams the button for LAVATORY GRANDE ROYALE.Never been here before.It's like something on the top floor of a luxury high rise casino in Atlantic City, where they put semi retarded adults from South Philly after they've blundered into the mega jackpot.It's got everything that a dimwitted pathological gambler would identify with luxury: gold plated fixtures, lots of injection molded pseudomarble, velvet drapes, and a butler.None of the U Stor It residents ever use The Lavatory Grande Royale.The only reason it's here is that this place happens to be across the street from LAX.Singaporean CEOs who want to have a shower and take a nice, leisurely crap, with all the sound effects, without having to hear and smell other travelers doing the same, can come here and put it all on their corporate travel card.The butler is a thirty year old Centroamerican whose eyes look a little funny, like they've been closed for the last several hours.He is just throwing some improbably thick towels over his arm as Hiro bursts in.Gotta get in and out in five minutes, Hiro says.You want shave?the butler says.He paws at his own cheeks suggestively, unable to peg Hiro's ethnic group.Love to.No time.He peels off his jockey shorts, tosses his swords onto the crushed velvet sofa, and steps into the marbleized amphitheatre of the shower stall.Hot water hits him from all directions at once.There's a knob on the wall so you can choose your favorite temperature.Afterward, he'd like to take a dump, read some of those glossy phone book sized magazines next to the high tech shitter, but he's got to get going.He dries himself off with a fresh towel the size of a circus tent, yanks on some loose drawstring slacks and a T shirt, throws some Kongbucks at the butler, and runs out, girding himself with the swords.It's a short flight, mostly because the military pilot is happy to eschew comfort in favor of speed.The chopper takes off at a shallow angle, keeping low so it won't get sucked into any jumbo jets, and as soon as the pilot gets room to maneuver, he whips the tail around, drops the nose, and lets the rotor yank them onward and upward across the basin, toward the sparsely lit mass of the Hollywood Hills.But they stop short of the Hills, and end up on the roof of a hospital.Part of the Mercy chain, which technically makes this Vatican airspace.So far, this has Juanita written all over it.Neurology ward, Major Clem says, delivering this string of nouns like an order.Fifth floor, east wing, room 564.The man in the hospital bed is Da5id.Extremely thick, wide leather straps have been stretched across the head and foot of the bed.Leather cuffs, lined with fluffy sheepskin, are attached to the straps.These cuffs have been fastened around Da5id's wrists and ankles.He's wearing a hospital gown that has mostly fallen off.The worst thing is that his eyes don't always point in the same direction.He's hooked up to an EKG that's charting his heartbeat, and even though Hiro's not a doctor, he can see it's not a regular pattern.It beats too fast, then it doesn't beat at all, then an alarm sounds, then it starts beating again.He has gone completely blank.His eyes are not seeing anything.At first, Hiro thinks that his body is limp and relaxed.Getting closer, he sees that Da5id is taut and shivering, slick with perspiration.We put in a temporary pacemaker, a woman says.Hiro turns.It's a nun who also appears to be a surgeon.How long has he been in convulsions?His ex wife called us in, said she was worried.Juanita.Yes.When the paramedics arrived, he had fallen out of his chair at home and was convulsing on the floor.You can see a bruise, here, where we think his computer fell off the table and hit him in the ribs.So to protect him from further damage, we put him in four points.But for the last half hour he's been like thislike his whole body is in fibrillation.If he stays this way, we'll take the restraints off.Was he wearing goggles?I don't know.I can check for you.But you think this happened while he was goggled into his computer?I really don't know, sir.All I know is, he's got such bad cardiac arrhythmia that we had to implant a temporary pacemaker right there on his office floor.We gave him some seizure medication, which didn't work.Put him on some downers to calm him, which worked slightly.Put his head into various pieces of imaging machinery to find out what the problem was.The jury is still out on that.Well, I'm going to go look at his house, Hiro says.The doctor shrugs.Let me know when he comes out of it, Hiro says.The doctor doesn't say anything to this.For the first time, Hiro realizes that Da5id's condition may not be temporary.As Hiro is stepping out into the hallway, Da5id speaks, e ne em ma ni a gi a gi ni mu ma ma dam e ne em am an ki ga a gi a gi ...Hiro turns around and looks.Da5id has gone limp in the restraints, seems relaxed, half asleep.He is looking at Hiro through half closed eyes.e ne em dam gal nun na a gi agi e ne em u mu un abzu ka a gi a agi ...Da5id's voice is deep and placid, with no trace of stress.The syllables roll off his tongue like drool.As Hiro walks down the hallway he can hear Da5id talking all the way.i ge en i ge en nu ge en nu ge en us sa tur ra lu ra ze em men ...Hiro gets back into the chopper.They cruise up the middle of Beachwood Canyon, headed straight for the Hollywood sign.Da5id's house has been transfigured by light.It's at the end of its own little road, at the summit of a hill.The road has been blocked off by a squat froglike Jeep thing from General Jim's, saturated red and blue light sweeping and pulsing out of it.Another helicopter is above the house, supported on a swirling column of radiance.Soldiers creep up and down the property, carrying hand held searchlights.We took the precaution of securing the area, Major Clem says.At the fringes of all this light, Hiro can see the dead organic colors of the hillside.The soldiers are trying to push it back with their searchlights, trying to burn it away.He is about to bury himself in it, become a single muddy pixel in some airline passenger's window.Plunging into the biomass.Da5id's laptop is on the floor next to the table where he liked to work.It is surrounded by medical debris.In the middle of this, Hiro finds Da5id's goggles, which either fell off when he hit the floor, or were stripped off by the paramedics.Hiro picks up the goggles.As he brings them up toward his eyes, he sees the image: a wall of black and white static.Da5id's computer has snow crashed.He closes his eyes and drops the goggles.You can't get hurt by looking at a bitmap.Or can you?The house is sort of a modernist castle with a high turret on one end.Da5id and Hiro and the rest of the hackers used to go up there with a case of beer and a hibachi and just spend a whole night, eating jumbo shrimp and crab legs and oysters and washing them down with beer.Now it's deserted, of course, just the hibachi, which is rusted and almost buried in gray ash, like an archaeological relic.Hiro has pinched one of Da5id's beers from the fridge, and he sits up here for a while, in what used to be his favorite place, drinking his beer slowly, like he used to, reading stories in the lights.The old central neighborhoods are packed in tight below an eternal, organic haze.In other cities, you breathe industrial contaminants, but in L. A. , you breathe amino acids.The hazy sprawl is ringed and netted with glowing lines, like hot wires in a toaster.At the outlet of the canyon, it comes close enough that the light sharpens and breaks up into stars, arches, glowing letters.Streams of red and white corpuscles throb down highways to the fuzzy logic of intelligent traffic lights.Farther away, spreading across the basin, a million sprightly logos smear into solid arcs, like geometric points merging into curves.To either side of the franchise ghettos, the loglo dwindles across a few shallow layers of development and into a surrounding dimness that is burst here and there by the blaze of a security spotlight in someone's backyard.The franchise and the virus work on the same principle: what thrives in one place will thrive in another.You just have to find a sufficiently virulent business plan, condense it into a three ring binderits DNAxerox it, and embed it in the fertile lining of a well traveled highway, preferably one with a left turn lane.Then the growth will expand until it runs up against its property lines.In olden times, you'd wander down to Mom's Cafe for a bite to eat and a cup of joe, and you would feel right at home.It worked just fine if you never left your home own.But if you went to the next town over, everyone would look up and stare at you when you came in the door, and the Blue Plate Special would be something you didn't recognize.If you did enough traveling, you'd never feel at home anywhere.But when a businessman from New Jersey goes to Dubuque, he knows he can walk into a McDonald's and no one will stare at him.He can order without having to look at the menu, and the food will always taste the same.McDonald's is Home, condensed into a three ring binder and xeroxed.No surprises is the motto of the franchise ghetto, its Good Housekeeping seal, subliminally blazoned on every sign and logo that make up the curves and grids of light that outline the Basin.The people of America, who live in the world's most surprising and terrible country, take comfort in that motto.Follow the loglo outward, to where the growth is enfolded into the valleys and the canyons, and you find the land of the refugees.They have fled from the true America, the America of atomic bombs, scalpings, hip hop, chaos theory, cement overshoes, snake handlers, spree killers, space walks, buffalo jumps, drive bys, cruise missiles; Sherman's March, gridlock, motorcycle gangs, and bungee jumping.They have parallel parked their bimbo boxes in identical computer designed Burbclave street patterns and secreted themselves in symmetrical sheetrock shitholes with vinyl floors and ill fitting woodwork and no sidewalks, vast house farms out in the loglo wilderness, a culture medium for a medium culture.The only ones left in the city are street people, feeding off debris; immigrants, thrown out like shrapnel from the destruction of the Asian powers; young bohos; and the technomedia priesthood of Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong.Young smart people like Da5id and Hiro, who take the risk of living in the city because they like stimulation and they know they can handle it.25  Y. T.  can't really tell where they are.It's clear that they're stuck in traffic.It's not like this is predictable or anything.Y. T.  must get under way now, she announces.No reaction for a sec.Then the hacker guy sits back in his chair, stares out through his goggles, ignoring the 3 D compu display, taking in a nice view of the wall.Okay, he says.Quick as a mongoose, the man with the glass eye darts in, yanks the aluminum case out of the cryogenic cylinder, tosses it to Y. T.  Meantime, one of the lounging around Mafia guys is opening the back door of the truck, giving them all a nice view of a traffic jam on the boulevard.One other thing, the man with the glass eye says, and shoves an envelope into one of Y. T.'s multitudinous pockets.What's that?Y. T.  says.He holds up his hands self protectively.Don't worry, it's just a little something.Now get going.He motions at the guy who's holding her plank.The guy turns out to be fairly hip, because he just throws the plank.It lands at an odd angle on the floor between them.But the spokes have long ago seen the floor coming, calculated all the angles, extended and flexed themselves like the legs and feet of a basketball player coming back to earth from a monster dunk.The plank lands on its feet, banks this way, then that, as it regains its balance, then steers itself right up to Y. T.  and stops beside her.She stands on it, kicks a few times, flies out the back door of the semi, and onto the hood of a Pontiac that was following them much too closely.Its windshield makes a nice surface to bank off of, and she gets her direction neatly reversed by the time she hits the pavement.The owner of the Pontiac is honking self righteously, but there's no way he can chase her down because traffic is totally stopped, Y. T.  is the only thing for miles around that is actually capable of movement.Which is the whole point of Kouriers in the first place.The Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates #1106 is a pretty big one.Its low serial number implies great age.It was built long ago, when land was cheap and lots were big.The parking lot is half full.Usually, all you see at a Reverend Wayne's are old beaters with wacky Spanish expressions nail polished on the rear bumpersthe rides of Centro American evangelicals who have come up north to get decent jobs and escape the relentlessly Catholic style of their homelands.This lot also has a lot of just plain old regular bimbo boxes with license plates from all the Burbclaves.Traffic is moving a little better on this stretch of the boulevard, and so Y. T.  comes into the lot at a pretty good clip, takes one or two orbits around the franchise to work off her speed.A smooth parking lot is hard to resist when you are going fast, and to look at it from a slightly less juvenile point of view, it's a good idea to scope things out, to be familiar with your environment.Y. T.  learns that this parking lot is linked with that of a Chop Shop franchise next door (We turn any vehicle into CASH in minutes!), which in turn flows into the lot of a neighboring strip mall.A dedicated thrasher could probably navigate from L. A.  to New York by coasting from one parking lot into the next.This parking lot makes popping and skittering noises in some areas.Looking down, she sees that behind the franchise, near the dumpster, the asphalt is strewn with small glass vials, like the one that Squeaky was looking at last night.They are scattered about like cigarette butts behind a bar.When the footpads of her wheels pass over these vials, they tiddlywink out from underneath and skitter across the pavement.People are lined up out the door, waiting to get in.Y. T.  jumps the line and goes inside.The front room of the Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates is, of course, like all the others.A row of padded vinyl chairs where worshippers can wait for their number to be called, with a potted plant at each end and a table strewn with primeval magazines.A toy corner where kids can kill time, reenacting imaginary, cosmic battles in injection molded plastic.A counter done up in fake wood so it looks like something from an old church.
