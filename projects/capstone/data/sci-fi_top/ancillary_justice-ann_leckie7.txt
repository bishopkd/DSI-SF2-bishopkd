She felt the ethnic Orsians were unduly favored.By you.Yes, my lord.So youre saying that in the first months of the annexation, Jen Shinnan found some Radchaai official willing to divert crates full of weapons so that five years later she could start trouble between the upper and lower city.To get you in trouble.My lord!Lieutenant Awn lifted her forehead one centimeter off the floor, then halted.I dont know how, I dont know why.I dont know wh She swallowed that last, which I knew would have been a lie.What I know is, it was my job to keep the peace in Ors.That peace was threatened and I acted to She stopped, realizing perhaps that the sentence would be an awkward one to finish.It was my job to protect the citizens in Ors.Which is why you so vehemently protested the execution of the people who endangered the citizens in Ors.Anaander Mianaais tone was dry, and sardonic.They were my responsibility, lord.And as I said at the time, they were under control, we could have held them until reinforcements arrived, very easily.You are the ultimate authority, and of course your orders must be obeyed, but I didnt understand why those people had to die.I still dont understand why they had to die right then.A half second pause.I dont need to understand why.Im here to follow your orders.But I She paused again.Swallowed.My lord, if you suspect anything of me, any wrongdoing or disloyalty, I beg you, have me interrogated when we reach Valskaay.The same drugs used for aptitudes testing and reeducation could be used for interrogation.A skilled interrogator could pry the most secret thoughts from a persons mind.An unskilled one could throw up irrelevancies and confabulations, could damage her subject nearly as badly as an unskilled reeducator.What Lieutenant Awn had asked for was something surrounded by legal obligationsnot least among them the requirement that two witnesses be present, and Lieutenant Awn would have the right to name one of them.I saw nausea and terror in her when Anaander Mianaai didnt answer.My lord, may I speak plainly?By all means, speak plainly, said Anaander Mianaai, dry and bitter.Lieutenant Awn spoke, terrified, face still to the floor.It was you.You diverted the guns, you planned that mob, with Jen Shinnan.But I dont understand why.It cant have been about me, Im nobody.But you do not intend to remain nobody, I think, replied Anaander Mianaai.Your pursuit of Skaaiat Awer tells me as much.My Lieutenant Awn swallowed.I never pursued her.We were friends.She oversaw the next district.Friends, you call that.Lieutenant Awns face heated.And she remembered her accent, and her diction.I am not presumptuous enough to call it more.Miserable.Frightened.Mianaai was silent for three seconds, and then said, Perhaps not.Skaaiat Awer is handsome and charming, and no doubt good in bed.Someone like you would be easily susceptible to her manipulation.I have suspected Awers disloyalty for some time.Lieutenant Awn wanted to speak, I could see the muscles in her throat tense, but no sound came out.I am, yes, speaking of sedition.You say youre loyal.And yet you associate with Skaaiat Awer.Anaander Mianaai gestured and Skaaiats voice sounded in the decade room.I know you, Awn.If youre going to do something that crazy, save it for when itll make a difference.And Lieutenant Awns reply: Like Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One?What difference, asked Anaander Mianaai, would you wish to make?The sort of difference, Lieutenant Awn replied, mouth gone dry, that Mercy of Sarrse soldier made.If she hadnt done what she did, all the business at Ime would still be going on.As she spoke Im sure she realized what it was she was saying.That this was dangerous territory.Her next words made it plain she did know.She died for it, yes.But she revealed all that corruption to you.I had had a week to think about the things Anaander Mianaai had said to me.By now I had worked out how the governor of Ime might have had the accesses that prevented Ime Station from reporting her activities.She could only have gotten those accesses from Anaander Mianaai herself.The only question was, which Anaander Mianaai had enabled it?It was on all the public news channels, Anaander Mianaai observed.I would have preferred it wasnt.Oh, yes, she said, in answer to Lieutenant Awns surprise.That wasnt by my desire.The entire incident has sown doubt where before there was none.Discontent and fear where there had been only confidence in my ability to provide justice and benefit.Rumors I could have dealt with, but reports through approved channels!Broadcast where every Radchaai could see and hear!And without the publicity I might have let the Rrrrrr take the traitors away quietly.Instead I had to negotiate for their return, or else let them stand as an invitation to further mutiny.It caused me a great deal of trouble.Its still causing trouble.I didnt realize, said Lieutenant Awn, panic in her voice.It was on all the public channels.Then realization struck her.I havent I havent said anything about Ors.To anyone.Except Skaaiat Awer, the Lord of the Radch pointed out.Which was hardly justLieutenant Skaaiat had been nearby, close enough to see with her own eyes the evidence that something had happened.No, Mianaai continued, in answer to Lieutenant Awns inarticulate query, it hasnt turned up on public channels.Yet.And I can see that the idea that Skaaiat Awer might be a traitor is distressing to you.I think youre having trouble believing it.Once again, Lieutenant Awn struggled to speak.That is correct, my lord, she finally managed.I can offer you, said Mianaai in reply, the opportunity to prove her innocence.And to better your situation.I can manipulate your assignment so that you can be close to her again.You need only take clientship when Skaaiat offersoh, shell offer, the Lord of the Radch said, seeing, Im sure, Lieutenant Awns despair and doubt at her words.Awer has been collecting people like you.Upstarts from previously unremarkable houses who suddenly find themselves in positions advantageous for business.Take clientship, and observe.And report was left unsaid.The Lord of the Radch was trying to turn her enemys instrument into her own.What would happen if she couldnt do that?But what would happen if she did?No matter what choice Lieutenant Awn made now, she would be acting against Anaander Mianaai, the Lord of the Radch.I had already seen her choice once, when faced with death.She would choose the path that kept her alive.And sheand Icould puzzle out the implications of that path later, would see what the options were when matters were less immediately urgent.In the Esk decade room Lieutenant Dariet asked, alarmed, Ship, whats wrong with One Esk?My lord, said Lieutenant Awn, her voice shaking with fear, face, as ever, to the floor.Do you order me?Stand by, Lieutenant, I said, directly into Lieutenant Dariets ear, because I could not make One Esk speak.Anaander Mianaai laughed, short and sharp.Lieutenant Awns answer had been as bald a refusal as a plain Never would have been.Ordering such a thing would be useless.Interrogate me when we reach Valskaay, Lieutenant Awn said.I demand it.I am loyal.So is Skaaiat Awer, I swear it, but if you doubt her, interrogate her as well.But of course Anaander Mianaai couldnt do that.Any interrogation would have witnesses.Any skilled interrogatorand there would be no point in using an unskilled onewould hardly fail to understand the drift of the questions put to either Lieutenant Awn or Lieutenant Skaaiat.It would be too open a move, spread information this Mianaai didnt want spread.Anaander Mianaai sat silent for four seconds.Impassive.One Var, she said, when those four seconds had passed, shoot Lieutenant Awn.I was not, now, a single fragmentary segment, alone and unsure what I might do if I received that order.I was all of myself.Taken as separate from me, One Esk was fonder of Lieutenant Awn than I was.But One Esk was not separate from me.It was, at the moment, very much part of me.Still, One Esk was only one small part of me.And I had shot officers before.I had even, under orders, shot my own captain.But those executions, distressing and unpleasant as they had been, had clearly been just.The penalty for disobedience is death.Lieutenant Awn had never disobeyed.Far from it.And worse, her death was meant to hide the actions of Anaander Mianaais enemy.The entire purpose of my existence was to oppose Anaander Mianaais enemies.But neither Mianaai was ready to move openly.I must conceal from this Mianaai the fact that she herself had already bound me to the opposing cause, until all was in readiness.I must, for the moment, obey as though I had no other choice, as though I desired nothing else.And in the end, in the great scheme of things, what was Lieutenant Awn, after all?Her parents would grieve, and her sister, and they would likely be ashamed that Lieutenant Awn had disgraced them by disobedience.But they wouldnt question.And if they questioned, it would do no good.Anaander Mianaais secret would be safe.All this I thought in the 1.3 seconds it took for Lieutenant Awn, shocked and terrified, to reflexively raise her head.And in that same time, the segment of One Var said, I am unarmed, my lord.It will take me approximately two minutes to acquire a sidearm.It was betrayal, to Lieutenant Awn, I saw it plainly.But she must have known I had no other choice.This is unjust, she said, head still up.Voice unsteady.Its improper.No benefit will accrue.Who are your fellow conspirators?asked Mianaai, coldly.Name them and I may spare your life.Half lifted up, hands under her shoulders, Lieutenant Awn blinked in complete confusion, bewilderment that was surely as visible to Mianaai as it was to me.Conspirators?I have never conspired with anyone.I have always served you.Above, on the command deck, I said in Captain Rubrans ear, Captain, we have a problem.Serving me, said Anaander Mianaai, is no longer sufficient.No longer sufficiently unambiguous.Which me do you serve?Wh began Lieutenant Awn, and Th And then, I dont understand.What problem?asked Captain Rubran, bowl of tea halfway to her mouth, only mildly alarmed.I am at war with myself, said Mianaai, in the Var decade room.I have been for nearly a thousand years.To Captain Rubran I said, I need One Esk to be sedated.At war, Anaander Mianaai continued on Var deck, over the future of the Radch.Something must have come suddenly clear for Lieutenant Awn.I saw a sharp, pure rage in her.Annexations and ancillaries, and people like me being assigned to the military.I dont understand you, Ship, said Captain Rubran, her voice even but definitely worried now.She set down her tea on the table beside her.Over the treaty with the Presger, said Mianaai, angrily.The rest followed from that.Whether you know it or not, you are the instrument of my enemy.And Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One exposed whatever it was you were doing at Ime, said Lieutenant Awn, her anger still clear and steady.That was you.The system governor was making ancillariesyou needed them for your war with yourself, didnt you.And Im sure thats not all she was doing for you.Is that why that soldier had to die even if it meant extra trouble getting her back from the Rrrrrr?And I  Im still standing by, Ship, said Lieutenant Dariet, in the Esk decade room.But I dont like this.Mercy of Sarrse One Amaat One knew almost nothing, but in the hands of the Rrrrrr, she was a piece that my enemy might use against me.As an officer on a troop carrier, you are nothing, but in a position of even minor planetary authority, with the potential backing of Skaaiat Awer to help you increase your influence, you are a potential danger to me.I could have just maneuvered you out of Ors, out of Awers way.But I wanted more.I wanted a graphic argument against recent decisions and policies.Had that fisherman not found the guns, or not reported them to you, had events that night gone as I wished, I would have made sure the story was on all the public channels.In one gesture I would have secured the loyalty of the Tanmind and removed someone troublesome to me, both minor aims, but I also would have been able to impress on everyone the danger of lowering our guard, of disarming in even a small way.And the danger of placing authority in less than competent hands.She made a short, bitter ha.I admit, I underestimated you.Underestimated your relationship with the Orsians in the lower city.One Var could delay no longer, and walked into the Var decade room, gun in hand.Lieutenant Awn heard it come in, turned her head slightly to watch it.It was my job, to protect the citizens of Ors.I took it seriously.I did it to the best of my ability.I failed, that once.But not because of you.She turned her head, looked straight at Anaander Mianaai, and said, I should have died rather than obey you, in the temple of Ikkt.Even if it wouldnt have done any good.You can fix that now, cant you, said Anaander Mianaai, and gave me the order to fire.I fired.Twenty years later, I would say to Arilesperas Strigan that Radchaai authorities didnt care what a citizen thought, so long as she did as she ought to do.It was quite true.But since that moment, since I saw Lieutenant Awn dead on the floor of my Var decade room, shot by One Var (or, to speak with less self deception, by me) I have wondered what the difference is between the two.I was compelled to obey this Mianaai, in order to lead her to believe that she did indeed compel me.But in that case, she did compel me.Acting for one Mianaai or the other was indistinguishable.And of course, in the end, whatever their differences, they were both the same.Thoughts are ephemeral, they evaporate in the moment they occur, unless they are given action and material form.Wishes and intentions, the same.Meaningless, unless they impel you to one choice or another, some deed or course of action, however insignificant.Thoughts that lead to action can be dangerous.Thoughts that do not, mean less than nothing.Lieutenant Awn lay on the floor of the Var decade room, facedown again, dead.The floor under her would need repair, and cleaning.The urgent issue, the important thing, at that moment, was to get One Esk moving because in approximately half a second no amount of filtering I could do would hide the strength of its reaction and I really needed to tell the captain what had happened and I couldnt remember Mianaais enemyMianaai herselflaying down the orders I knew she had laid on me and why couldnt One Esk see how important it was, we werent ready to move openly yet and Id lost officers before and who was One Esk anyway except me, myself, and Lieutenant Awn was dead and she had said, I should have died rather than obey you.And then One Var swung the gun up and shot Anaander Mianaai point blank in the face.In a room down the corridor, Anaander Mianaai leaped with a cry of rage off the bed shed been lying on.Aatrs tits, she was here before me!In the same moment she transmitted the code that would force One Vars armor down, until she reauthorized its use.It was a command that didnt rely on my obedience, an override neither Anaander would have wanted to do away with.Captain, I said, now we really have a problem.In another room down the same corridor, the third Mianaaithe second, now, I supposeopened one of the cases she had brought with her and pulled out a sidearm, and stepped quickly into the corridor and shot the nearest One Var in the back of the head.The one who had spoken opened her own case, pulled out a sidearm and also a box I recognized from Jen Shinnans house, in the upper city, on Shisurna.Using it would disadvantage her as well as me, but it would disadvantage me badly.In the seconds she took to arm the device I formed intentions, transmitted orders to constituent parts.What problem?asked Captain Rubran, now standing.Afraid.And then I fell to pieces.A familiar sensation.For the smallest fragment of a second I smelled humid air and lake water, thought, Wheres Lieutenant Awn?and then I recovered myself, and the memory of what I had to do.Tea bowls rang and shattered as I dropped what I was holding and ran from the Esk decade room, down the corridor.Other segments, separated from me again as they had been in Ors, muttering, whispering, the only way I could think between all my bodies, opened lockers, handed guns, and the first to be armed forced the lift doors open and began to climb down the shaft.Lieutenants protested, ordered me to stop, to explain.Tried fruitlessly to block my way.Ithat is, almost the entirety of One Eskwould secure the central access deck, prevent Anaander Mianaai from damaging myJustice of Torensbrain.So long as Justice of Toren lived, unconverted to her cause, itIwas a danger to her.IOne Esk Nineteenhad separate orders.Instead of climbing down the shaft to central access I ran the other way, toward the Esk hold and the airlock on its far side.I wasnt, apparently, responding to any of my lieutenants, or even Commander Tiaund, but when Lieutenant Dariet cried, Ship!Have you lost your mind?I answered.The Lord of the Radch shot Lieutenant Awn!cried a segment somewhere in the corridor behind me.Shes been on Var deck all this time.That silenced my officersincluding Lieutenant Darietfor only a second.If thats even true but if it is, the Lord of the Radch wouldnt have shot her for no reason.Behind me the segments of myself that hadnt yet begun their climb down the lift shaft hissed and gasped in frustration and anger.Useless!I heard myself say to Lieutenant Dariet as at the end of the corridor I manually opened the hold door.Youre as bad as Lieutenant Issaaia!At least Lieutenant Awn knew she held her in contempt!An indignant cry, surely Lieutenant Issaaia, and Dariet said, You dont know what youre talking about.Youre not functioning right, Ship!The door slid open, and I could not stop to hear the rest, but plunged into the hold.A deep, steady thunking shook the deck I ran on, a sound just hours ago I thought I would never hear again.Mianaai was opening the Var holds.Any ancillary she thawed would have no memory of recent events, nothing to tell it not to obey this Mianaai.And its armor wouldnt have been disabled.She would take Two Var and Three and Four and as many as she had time to awaken, and try to take either the central access deck or the engines.More likely both.She had, after all, Var and every hold below it.Though the segments would be clumsy and confused.They would have no memory of functioning apart, the way I had, no practice.But numbers were on her side.I had only the segments that had been awake at the moment I fragmented.Above, my officers had access to the upper half of the holds.And they would have no reason not to obey Anaander Mianaai, no reason not to think I had lost my mind.I was, at this moment, explaining matters to Hundred Captain Rubran, but I had no confidence she would believe me, or think me even remotely sane.Around me, the same thunking began that was sounding below my feet.My officers were pulling up Esk segments to thaw.I reached the airlock, threw open the locker beside it, pulled out the pieces of the vacuum suit that would fit this segment.I didnt know how long I could hold central access, or the engines.I didnt know how desperate Anaander Mianaai might be, what damage she might think I could do to her.The engines heat shield was, by design, extremely difficult to breach, but I knew how to do it.And the Lord of the Radch certainly did as well.And whatever happened between here and there, it was a near certainty I would die shortly after I reached Valskaay, if not before.But I would not die without explaining myself.I would have to reach and board a shuttle, and then manually undock, and depart Justice of Torenmyselfat exactly the right time, at exactly the right speed, on exactly the right heading, fly through the wall of my surrounding bubble of normal space at exactly the right moment.If I did all that, I would find myself in a system with a gate, four jumps from Irei Palace, one of Anaander Mianaais provincial headquarters.I could tell her what had happened.The shuttles were docked on this side of the ship.The hatches and the undocking ought to work smoothly, it was all equipment I had tested and maintained myself.Still, I found myself worrying that something would go wrong.At least it was better than thinking about fighting my own officers.Or the heat shields failing.I fastened my helmet.My breath hissed loud in my ears.Faster than it should have.I forced myself to slow my breathing, deepen it.Hyperventilating wouldnt help.I had to move quickly, but not so hastily that I made some fatally foolish mistake.Waiting for the airlock to cycle, I felt my aloneness like an impenetrable wall pressing around me.Usually one bodys off kilter emotion was a minor, easily dismissable thing.Now it was only this one body, nothing beyond to temper my distress.The rest of me was here, all around, but inaccessible.Soon, if things went right, I wouldnt even be near my self, or have any idea when I might rejoin it.And at this moment I could do nothing but wait.And remember the feel of the gun in One Vars handmy hand.I was One Esk, but what was the difference?The recoil as One Var shot Lieutenant Awn.The guilt and helpless anger that had overwhelmed me had receded at that moment, overcome by more urgent necessity, but now I had time to remember.My next three breaths were ragged and sobbing.For a moment I was perversely glad I was hidden from myself.I had to calm myself.Had to clear my mind.I thought of songs I knew.My heart is a fish, I thought, but when I opened my mouth to sing it, my throat closed.I swallowed.Breathed.Thought of another one.Oh, have you gone to the battlefield  Armored and well armed?And shall dreadful events  Force you to drop your weapons?The outer door opened.If Mianaai had not used her device, officers on duty would have seen that the lock had opened, would have notified Captain Rubran, drawing Mianaais attention.But she had used it, and she had no way of knowing what I did.I reached around the doorway for a handhold and pulled myself out.Looking at the inside of a gateway often made humans queasy.It had never bothered me before, but now I was nothing but a single human body I found it did the same to me.Black, but a black that seemed simultaneously an unthinkable depth into which I might fall, was falling, and a suffocating closeness ready to press me into nonexistence.I forced myself to look away.Here, outside, there was no floor, no gravity generator to keep me in place and give me an up and down.I moved from one handhold to the next.What was happening behind me, inside the ship that was no longer my body?It took seventeen minutes to reach a shuttle, operate its emergency hatch, and perform a manual undock.At first I fought the desire to halt, to look behind me, to listen for the sounds of someone coming to stop me, never mind I couldnt have heard anything outside my own helmet.Just maintenance, I told myself.Just maintenance outside the hull.Youve done it hundreds of times.If anyone came I could do nothing.Esk would have failedI would have failed.And my time was limited.I might not be stopped, and still fail.I could not think of any of that.When the moment came, I was ready and away.My view was limited to fore and aft, the only two hardwired cameras on the shuttle.As Justice of Toren receded in the aft view, the rising sense of panic that I had mostly held in check till now overtook me.What was I doing?Where was I going?What could I possibly accomplish alone and single bodied, deaf and blind and cut off?What could be the point of defying Anaander Mianaai, who had made me, who owned me, who was unutterably more powerful than I would ever be?I breathed.I would return to the Radch.I would eventually return to Justice of Toren, even if only for the last moments of my life.My blindness and deafness were irrelevant.There was only the task before me.There was nothing to do but sit in the pilots chair and watch Justice of Toren get smaller, and farther away.Think of another song.According to the chronometer, if I had done everything exactly as I should, Justice of Toren would disappear from my screen in four minutes and thirty two seconds.I watched, counting, trying not to think of anything else.The aft view flashed bright, blue white, and my breath stopped.When the screen cleared I saw nothing but blackand stars.I had exited my self made gate.I had exited more than four minutes too soon.And what had that flash been?I ought only to have seen the ship disappear, the stars suddenly spring into existence.Mianaai had not attempted to take central access, or join forces with the officers on the upper decks.The moment she realized I had already fallen to her enemy, she must have resolved immediately to take the most desperate course available to her.She and what Var ancillaries she had serving her had taken my engines, and breached the heat shield.How I had escaped and not vaporized along with the rest of the ship, I couldnt account for, but there had been that flash, and here I still was.Justice of Toren was gone, and all aboard it.I was not where I was supposed to be, might be unreachably distant from Radch space, or any human worlds at all.All possibility of being reunited with myself was gone.The captain was dead.All my officers were dead.Civil war loomed.I had shot Lieutenant Awn.Nothing would ever be right again.17   Luckily for me, I had come out of gate space on the fringes of a backwater, non Radchaai system, a collection of habitats and mining stations inhabited by heavily modified peoplenot human, by Radchaai standards, people with six or eight limbs (and no guarantee any of them would be legs), vacuum adapted skin and lungs, brains so meshed and crosshatched with implants and wiring it was an open question whether they were anything but conscious machines with a biological interface.It was a mystery to them that anyone would choose the sort of primitive form most humans I knew were born with.But they prized their isolation, and it was a dearly held tenet of their society that, with a few exceptions (most of which they would not actually admit to), one did not ask for anything a person did not volunteer.They viewed me with a combination of puzzlement and mild contempt, and treated me as though I were a child who had wandered into their midst and they might keep half an eye on me until my parents found me, but really I wasnt their responsibility.If any of them guessed my originand surely they did, the shuttle alone was enoughthey didnt say so, and no one pressed me for answers, something they would have found appallingly rude.They were silent, clannish, self contained, but they were also brusquely generous at unpredictable intervals.I would still be there, or dead, if not for that.I spent six months trying to understand how to do anythingnot just how to get my message to the Lord of the Radch, but how to walk and breathe and sleep and eat as myself.As a myself that was only a fragment of what I had been, with no conceivable future beyond eternally wishing for what was gone.Then one day a human ship arrived, and the captain was happy to take me on board in exchange for what little money I had left from scrapping the shuttle, which had been running up docking charges I couldnt pay otherwise.I found out later that a four meter, tentacled eel of a person had paid the balance of my fare without telling me, because, she had told the captain, I didnt belong there and would be healthier elsewhere.Odd people, as I said, and I owe them a great deal, though they would be offended and distressed to think anyone owed them anything.In the nineteen years since then, I had learned eleven languages and 713 songs.I had found ways to conceal what I waseven, I was fairly sure, from the Lord of the Radch herself.I had worked as a cook, a janitor, a pilot.I had settled on a plan of action.I had joined a religious order, and made a great deal of money.In all that time I only killed a dozen people.By the time I woke the next morning, the impulse to tell Seivarden anything had passed, and she seemed to have forgotten her questions.Except one.So where next?She asked it casually, sitting on the bench by my bed, leaning against the wall, as though she were only idly curious about the answer.When she heard, maybe shed decide she liked it better on her own.Omaugh Palace.She frowned, just slightly.That a new one?Not particularly.It had been built seven hundred years ago.But after Garsedd, yes.My right ankle began to tingle and itch, a sure sign the corrective was finished.You left Radchaai space unauthorized.And you sold your armor to do it.Extraordinary circumstances, she said, still leaning back.Ill appeal.Thatll get you a delay, at any rate.Any citizen who wanted to see the Lord of the Radch could apply to do so, though the farther one was from a provincial palace, the more complicated, expensive, and time consuming the journey would be.Sometimes applications were turned down, when the distance was great and the cause was judged hopeless or frivolousand the petitioner was unable to pay her own way.But Anaander Mianaai was the final appeal for nearly any matter, and this case was certainly not routine.And she would be right there on the station.Youll wait months for an audience.Seivarden gestured her lack of concern.What are you going to do there?Try to kill Anaander Mianaai.But I couldnt say that.See the sights.Buy some souvenirs.Maybe try to meet the Lord of the Radch.She lifted an eyebrow.Then she looked at my pack.She knew about the gun, and of course she understood how dangerous it was.She still thought I was an agent of the Radch.Undercover the whole way?And when you hand thatshe shrugged toward my packover to the Lord of the Radch, then what?I dont know.I closed my eyes.I could see no further than arriving at Omaugh Palace, had not even the remotest shadow of an idea of what to do after that, how I might get close enough to Anaander Mianaai to use the gun.No.That wasnt true.The beginning of a plan had this moment suggested itself to me, but it was horribly impractical, relying as it did on Seivardens discretion and support.She had constructed her own idea of what I was doing and why I would return to the Radch playing a foreign tourist.Why I would report directly to Anaander Mianaai instead of a Special Missions officer.I could use that.Im coming with you, Seivarden said, and as though she had guessed my thoughts she added, You can come to my appeal and speak on my behalf.I didnt trust myself to answer.Pins and needles traveled up my right leg, started in my hands, arms, and shoulders, and my left leg.A slight ache began in my right hip.Something hadnt healed quite right.Its not as if I dont already know whats going on, Seivarden said.So when you steal from me, breaking your legs wont be enough.Ill have to kill you.My eyes still closed, I couldnt see her reaction to that.She might well take it as a joke.I wont, she answered.Youll see.I spent several more days in Therrod recovering sufficiently that the doctor would approve my leaving.All that time, and afterward all the way up the ribbon, Seivarden was polite and deferential.It worried me.I had stashed money and belongings at the top of the Nilt ribbon, and would have to retrieve them before we left.Everything was packaged, so I could do that without Seivarden seeing much more than a couple of boxes, but I had no illusions she wouldnt try to open them first chance she got.At least I had money again.And maybe that was the solution to the problem.I took a room on the ribbon station, left Seivarden there with instructions to wait, and went to recover my possessions.When I returned she was sitting on the single bedno linens or blankets, that was conventionally extra herefidgeting.One knee bouncing, rubbing her upper arms with her bare handsI had sold our heavy outer coats, and the gloves, at the foot of the ribbon.She stilled when I came in, and looked expectantly at me, but said nothing.I tossed into her lap a bag that made a tumbling clicking sound as it landed.Seivarden gave it one frowning look, and then turned her gaze to me, not moving to touch the bag or claim it in any way.Whats this?Ten thousand shen, I said.It was the most commonly negotiable currency in this region, in easily transportable (and spent) chits.Ten thousand would buy a lot, here.It would buy passage to another system with enough left over to binge for several weeks.Is that a lot?Yes.Her eyes widened, just slightly, and for half a second I saw calculation in her expression.Time for me to be direct.The room is paid up for the next ten days.After that I gestured at the bag on her lap.That should last you a while.Longer if youre truly serious about staying off kef.But that look, when shed realized she had access to money, made me fairly certain she wasnt.Not really.For six seconds Seivarden looked down at the bag in her lap.No.She picked the bag up gingerly, between her thumb and forefinger, as though it were a dead rat, and dropped it on the floor.Im coming with you.I didnt answer, only looked at her.Silence stretched out.Finally she looked away, crossed her arms.Isnt there any tea?Not the sort youre used to.I dont care.Well.I didnt want to leave her here alone with my money and possessions.Come on, then.We left the room, found a shop on the main corridor that sold things for flavoring hot water.Seivarden sniffed one of the blends on offer.Wrinkled her nose.This is tea?The shops proprietor watched us from the corner of her vision, not wanting to seem to watch us.I told you it wasnt the sort you were used to.You said you didnt care.She thought about that a moment.To my utter surprise, instead of arguing, or complaining further about the unsatisfactory nature of the tea in question, she said, calmly, What do you recommend?I gestured my uncertainty.Im not in the habit of drinking tea.Not in the She stared at me.Oh.Dont they drink tea in the Gerentate?Not the way you people do.And of course tea was for officers.For humans.Ancillaries drank water.Tea was an extra, unnecessary expense.A luxury.So I had never developed the habit.I turned to the proprietor, a Nilter, short and pale and fat, in shirtsleeves though the temperature here was a constant four C and Seivarden and I both still wore our inner coats.Which of these has caffeine in it?She answered, pleasantly enough, and became pleasanter when I bought not only 250 grams each of two kinds of tea but also a flask with two cups, and two bottles, along with water to fill them.Seivarden carried the whole lot back to our lodging, walking alongside me saying nothing.In the room she laid our purchases on the bed, sat down beside them, and picked up the flask, puzzling over the unfamiliar design.I could have showed her how it worked, but decided not to.Instead I opened my newly claimed luggage and dug out a thick golden disk three centimeters larger in diameter than the one I had carried with me, and a small, shallow bowl of hammered gold, eight centimeters in diameter.I closed the trunk, set the bowl on it, and triggered the image in the disk.Seivarden looked up to watch it unfold into a wide, flat flower in mother of pearl, a woman standing in its center.She wore a knee length robe of the same iridescent white, inlaid with gold and silver.In one hand she held a human skull, itself inlaid with jewels, red and blue and yellow, and in the other hand a knife.Thats like the other one, Seivarden said, sounding mildly interested.But it doesnt look so much like you.True, I answered, and sat cross legged before the trunk.Is that a Gerentate god?Its one I met, traveling.Seivarden made a breathy, noncommittal noise.Whats its name?I spoke the long string of syllables, which left Seivarden nonplussed.It means She Who Sprang from the Lily.She is the creator of the universe.This would make her Amaat, in Radchaai terms.Ah, said Seivarden, in a tone I knew meant shed made that equation, made the strange god familiar and brought it safely within her mental framework.And the other one?A saint.What a remarkable thing, that she should resemble you so much.Yes.Although shes not the saint.The head shes holding is.Seivarden blinked, frowned.It was very un Radchaai.Still.Nothing was just a coincidence, not for Radchaai.Such odd chances couldand didsend Radchaai on pilgrimages, motivate them to worship particular gods, change entrenched habits.They were direct messages from Amaat.Im going to pray now, I said.With one hand Seivarden made a gesture of acknowledgment.I unfolded a small knife, pricked my thumb, and bled into the gold bowl.I didnt look to see Seivardens reactionno Radchaai god took blood, and I hadnt troubled to wash my hands first.It was guaranteed to lift Radchaai eyebrows, to register as foreign and even primitive.But Seivarden didnt say anything.She sat silent for thirty one seconds as I intoned the first of the 322 names of the Hundred of White Lily, and then she turned her attention to the flask, and making tea.Seivarden had said shed lasted six months at her last attempt to quit kef.It took seven months to reach a station with a Radchaai consulate.Approaching the first leg of the journey, I had told the purser in Seivardens hearing that I wanted passage for myself and my servant.She hadnt reacted, that I could see.Perhaps she hadnt understood.But I had expected a more or less angry recrimination in private when she discovered her status, and she never mentioned it.And from then on I woke to find tea already made and waiting for me.She also ruined two shirts attempting to launder them, leaving me with one for an entire month until we docked at the next station.The ships captainshe was Ki, tall and covered in ritual scarslet fall in an oblique, circuitous way that she and all her crew thought Id taken Seivarden on as a charity case.Which wasnt far from the truth.I didnt contest it.But Seivarden improved, and three months later, on the next ship, a fellow passenger tried to hire her away from me.Which wasnt to say she had suddenly become a different person, or entirely deferential.Some days she spoke irritably to me, for no reason I could see, or spent hours curled in her bunk, her face to the wall, rising only for her self imposed duties.The first few times I spoke to her when she was in that mood I only received silence in reply, so after that I left her alone.The Radchaai consulate was staffed by the Translators Office, and the consular agents spotless white uniformincluding pristine white glovesargued she either had a servant or spent a good deal of her free time attempting to appear as though she did.The tastefuland expensive lookingjeweled strands wound in her hair, and the names on the memorial pins that glittered everywhere on the white jacket, as well as the faint disdain in her voice when she spoke to me, argued servant.Though likely only onethis was an out of the way posting.As a visiting noncitizen your legal rights are restricted.It was clearly a rote speech.You must deposit at minimum the equivalent of Fingers twitched as she checked the exchange rate.Five hundred shen per week of your visit, per person.If your lodging, food, and any extra purchases, fines, or damages exceed the amount on deposit and you cannot pay the balance, you will be legally obligated to take an assignment until your debt is paid.As a noncitizen your right to appeal any judgment or assignment is limited.Do you still wish to enter Radch space?I do, I said, and laid two million shen chits on the slim desk between us.Her disdain vanished.She sat slightly straighter and offered me tea, gesturing slightly, fingers twitching again as she communicated with someone elseher servant, it turned out, who, with a slightly harried air, brought tea in an elaborately enameled flask, and bowls to match.While the servant poured, I brought out my forged Gerentate credentials and placed those on the desk as well.You must also provide identification for your servant, honored, said the consular agent, now all politeness.My servant is a Radchaai citizen, I answered, smiling slightly.Meaning to take the edge off what was going to be an awkward moment.But shes lost her identification and her travel permits.The consular agent froze, attempting to process that.The honored Breq, said Seivarden, standing behind me, in antique, effortlessly elegant Radchaai, has been generous enough to employ me and pay my passage home.This didnt resolve the consular agents astonished paralysis quite as effectively as Seivarden perhaps had wished.That accent didnt belong on anyones servant, let alone a noncitizens.And she hadnt offered Seivarden a seat, or tea, thinking her too insignificant for such courtesies.Surely you can take genetic information, I suggested.Yes, of course, answered the consular agent, with a sunny smile.Though your visa application will almost certainly come through before Citizen  Seivarden, I supplied.before Citizen Seivardens travel permits are reissued.Depending on where she departed from and where her records are.Of course, I answered, and sipped my tea.Thats only to be expected.As we left, Seivarden said to me, in an undertone, What a snob.Was that real tea?It was.I waited for her to complain about not having had any, but she said nothing more.It was very good.What are you going to do if an arrest order comes through instead of travel permits?She made a gesture of denial.Why should they?Im already asking to come back, they can arrest me when I get there.And Ill appeal.Do you think the consul has that tea shipped from home, or might someone here sell it?Find out, if you like, I said.Im going back to the room to meditate.The consular agents servant outright gave Seivarden half a kilo of tea, likely grateful for the opportunity to make up for her employers unintentional slight earlier.And when my visa came through, so did travel permits for Seivarden, and no arrest order, or any additional comment or information at all.That worried me, if only slightly.But likely Seivarden was rightwhy do anything else?When she stepped off the ship there would be time and opportunity enough to address her legal troubles.Still.It was possible Radch authorities had realized I wasnt actually a citizen of the Gerentate.It was unlikelythe Gerentate was a long, long way from where I was going, and besides, despite fairly friendlyor at least, not openly antagonisticrelations between the Gerentate and the Radch, as a matter of policy the Gerentate didnt supply any information at all about its residentsnot to the Radch.If the Radch askedand they wouldntthe Gerentate would neither confirm nor deny that I was one of its citizens.Had I been departing from the Gerentate for Radchaai space I would have been warned repeatedly that I traveled at my own risk and would receive no assistance if I found myself in difficulties.But the Radchaai officials who dealt with foreign travelers knew this already, and would be prepared to take my identification more or less at face value.Anaander Mianaais thirteen palaces were the capitals of their provinces.Metropolis size stations, each one half ordinary large Radchaai stationwith accompanying station AIand half palace proper.Each palace proper was the residence of Anaander Mianaai, and the seat of provincial administration.Omaugh Palace wouldnt be any sort of quiet backwater.A dozen gates led to its system, and hundreds of ships came and went each day.Seivarden would be one of thousands of citizens seeking audience, or making an appeal in some legal case.A noticeable one, certainlynone of those other citizens were returned from a thousand years in suspension.I spent the months of travel considering just what I wanted to do about that.How to use it.How to counter its disadvantages, or turn them to my favor.And considering just what it was I hoped to accomplish.Its hard for me to know how much of myself I remember.How much I might have known, that I had hidden from myself all my life.Take, for instance, that last order, the instruction IJustice of Toren had given to meOne Esk Nineteen.Get to Irei Palace, find Anaander Mianaai, and tell her whats happened.What did I mean by that?Over and above the obvious, the bare fact Id wanted to get the message to the Lord of the Radch?Why had it been so important?Because it had been.It hadnt been an afterthought, it had been an urgent necessity.At the time it had seemed clear.Of course I needed to get the message out, of course I needed to warn the right Anaander.I would follow my orders.But in the time Id spent recovering from my own death, the time working my way toward Radch space, I had decided I would do something else as well.I would defy the Lord of the Radch.And perhaps my defiance would amount to nothing, a feeble gesture she would barely notice.The truth was, Strigan was right.My desire to kill Anaander Mianaai was unreasonable.Any actual attempt to do such a thing was not sane.Even given a gun that I could carry into the very presence of the Lord of the Radch herself without her knowing until I chose to reveal iteven given that, all I could hope to accomplish was a pitiful cry of defiance, gone as soon as made, easily disregarded.Nothing that could possibly make any difference.But.All that secret maneuvering against herself.Designed, certainly, to avoid open conflict, to avoid damaging the Radch too badly.To avoid, perhaps, too badly fracturing Anaander Mianaais conviction that she was unitary, one person.Once the dilemma had been clearly stated, could she pretend things were otherwise?And if there were now two Anaander Mianaais, might there not also be more?A part, perhaps, that didnt know about the feuding sides of herself?Or told herself she didnt?What would happen if I said straight out the thing the Lord of the Radch had been concealing from herself?Something dire, surely, or she would not have gone to such lengths to hide herself from herself.Once the thing was open and acknowledged, how could she help tearing herself apart?But how could I say anything straight out to Anaander Mianaai?Granted I could reach Omaugh Palace, granted I could leave the ship, step onto the stationif I could do that much then I could stand in the middle of the main concourse and shout my story aloud for everyone to hear.I might begin to do that, but I would never finish.Security would come for me, maybe even soldiers, and that days news would say a traveler had lost her mind on the concourse, but Security had dealt with the situation.Citizens would shake their heads, and mutter about uncivilized foreigners, and then forget all about me.And whichever part of the Lord of the Radch noticed me first could no doubt easily dismiss me as damaged and insaneor at least, convince the various other parts of herself that I was.No, I needed the full attention of Anaander Mianaai, when I said what I had to say.How to get it was a problem I had worried at for nearly twenty years.I knew that it would be harder to ignore someone whose erasure would be noticed.I could visit the station and try to be seen, to become familiar, so that any part of Anaander couldnt just dispose of me without comment.But I didnt think that would be enough to force the Lord of the Radchall of the Lord of the Radchto listen to me.But Seivarden.Captain Seivarden Vendaai, lost a thousand years, found by chance, lost again.Appearing now at Omaugh Palace.Any Radchaai would be curious about that, with a curiosity that carried a religious charge.And Anaander Mianaai was Radchaai.Perhaps the most Radchaai of Radchaai.She couldnt help but notice that I had returned in company with Seivarden.Like any other citizen she would wonder, even if only at the back of her mind, what, if anything, that might mean.And she being who she was, the back of her mind was a substantial thing.Seivarden would ask for an audience.Would be, eventually, granted one.And that audience would have all of Anaanders attention; no part of her would ignore such an event.And surely Seivarden would have the attention of the Lord of the Radch from the moment we stepped off the ship.So, arriving in Seivardens company, would I.  Tremendously risky.I might not have concealed my nature well enough, might be recognized for what I was.But I was determined to try.I sat on the bunk waiting for permission to leave the ship at Omaugh Palace, my pack at my feet, Seivarden leaning negligently against the wall across from me, bored.Somethings bothering you, Seivarden observed, casually.I didnt answer, and she said, You always hum that tune when youre preoccupied.My heart is a fish, hiding in the water grass.I had been thinking of all the ways things could go wrong, starting now, starting the moment I stepped off the ship and confronted the dock inspectors.Or Station Security.Or worse.Thinking of how everything I had done would be for nothing if I was arrested before I could even leave the docks.And I had been thinking about Lieutenant Awn.Im so transparent?I made myself smile, as though I were mildly amused.Not transparent.Not exactly.Just She hesitated.Frowned slightly, as though shed suddenly regretted speaking.You have a few habits Ive noticed, thats all.She sighed.Are the dock inspectors having tea?Or just waiting till weve aged sufficiently?We couldnt leave the ship without the permission of the Inspectors Office.The inspector would have received our credentials when the ship requested permission to dock, and had plenty of time to look over them and decide what to do when we arrived.Still leaning against the bulkhead, Seivarden closed her eyes and began to hum.Wobbling, pitch sinking or rising by turns as she mis sang intervals.But still recognizable.My heart is a fish.Aatrs tits, she swore after a verse and a half, eyes still closed.Now youve got me doing it.The door chime sounded.Enter, I said.Seivarden opened her eyes, sat straight.Suddenly tense.The boredom had been a pose, I suspected.The door slid open to reveal a person in the dark blue jacket, gloves, and trousers of a dock inspector.She was slight, and young, maybe twenty three or  four.She looked familiar, though I couldnt think who it was she reminded me of.The sparser than usual scatter of jewelry and memorial pins might tell me, if I stared closely enough to read names.Which would be rude.Across from me, Seivarden tucked her bare hands behind her back.Honored Breq, the inspector adjunct said, with a slight bow.She seemed unfazed by my own bare hands.Used to dealing with foreigners, I supposed.Citizen Seivarden.Would you please accompany me to the inspector supervisors office?And there should have been no need for us to visit the inspector supervisor herself.This adjunct could pass us onto the station on her own authority.Or order our arrest.We followed her past the lock into the loading bay, past another lock into a corridor busy with peopledock inspectors in dark blue, Station Security in light brown, here and there the darker brown of soldiers, and spots of brighter colora scatter of non uniformed citizens.This corridor opened into a wide room, a dozen gods along the walls to watch over travelers and traders, on one end the entrance to the station proper, and opposite, the doorway into the inspectors office.The adjunct escorted us through the outermost office, where nine blue uniformed minor adjuncts dealt with complaining ship captains, and beyond them were offices for likely a dozen major adjuncts and their crews.Past those and into an inner office, with four chairs and a small table, and a door at the back, closed.I am sorry, cit honored, and citizen, said the adjunct who had led us here, fingers twitching as she communicated with someonelikely the station AI, or the inspector supervisor herself.The inspector supervisor was available, but somethings come up.Im sure it wont be more than a few minutes.Please have a seat.Will you have tea?A reasonably long wait, then.And the courtesy of tea implied this wasnt an arrest.That no one had discovered my credentials were forged.Everyone hereincluding Stationwould assume I was what I said I was, a foreign traveler.And possibly I would have a chance to discover just who this young inspector adjunct reminded me of.Now shed spoken at a bit more length, I noticed a slight accent.Where was she from?Yes, thank you, I said.Seivarden didnt respond to the offer of tea right away.Her arms were folded, her bare hands tucked under her elbows.She likely wanted the tea but was embarrassed about her ungloved hands, couldnt hide them holding a bowl.Or so I thought until she said, I cant understand a word shes saying.Seivardens accent and way of speaking would be familiar to most educated Radchaai, from old entertainments and the way Anaander Mianaais speech was widely emulated by prestigiousor hopefully prestigiousfamilies.I hadnt thought changes in pronunciation and vocabulary had been so extreme.But Id lived through them, and Seivardens ear for language had never been the sharpest.Shes offering tea.Oh.Seivarden looked briefly at her crossed arms.No.I took the tea the adjunct poured from a flask on the table, thanked her, and took a seat.The office had been painted a pale green, the floor tiled with something that had probably been intended to look like wood and might have succeeded if the designer had ever seen anything but imitations of imitations.A niche in the wall behind the young adjunct held an icon of Amaat and a small bowl of bright orange, ruffle petaled flowers.And beside that, a tiny brass copy of the cliffside in the temple of Ikkt.You could buy them, I knew, from vendors in the plaza in front of the Fore Temple water, during pilgrimage season.I looked at the adjunct again.Who was she?Someone I knew?A relative of someone Id met?Youre humming again, Seivarden said in an undertone.Excuse me.I took a sip of tea.Its a habit I have.I apologize.No need, said the adjunct, and took her own seat by the table.This was, fairly clearly, her own office and so she was direct assistant to the inspector supervisoran unusual place for someone so young.I havent heard that song since I was a child.Seivarden blinked, not understanding.If she had, she likely would have smiled.A Radchaai could live nearly two hundred years.This inspector adjunct, probably a legal adult for a decade, was still impossibly young.I used to know someone else who sang all the time, the adjunct continued.I knew her.Had probably bought songs from her.She would have been maybe four, maybe five, when Id left Ors.Maybe slightly older, if she remembered me with any clarity.The inspector supervisor behind that door would be someone who had spent time on Shisurnain Ors itself, most likely.What did I know about the lieutenant who had replaced Lieutenant Awn as administrator there?How likely was it shed resigned her military assignment and taken one as a dock inspector?It wasnt unheard of.Whoever the inspector supervisor was, she had money and influence enough to bring this adjunct here from Ors.I wanted to ask the young woman the name of her patron, but that would be unthinkably rude.Im told, I said, meaning to sound idly curious, and playing up my Gerentate accent just the smallest bit, that the jewelry you Radchaai wear has some sort of significance.Seivarden cast me a puzzled look.The adjunct only smiled.Some of it.Her Orsian accent, now I had identified it, was clear, obvious.This one for instance.She slid one gloved finger under a gold colored dangle pinned near her left shoulder.Its a memorial.May I look closer?I asked, and receiving permission moved my chair near, and bent to read the name engraved in Radchaai on the plain metal, one I didnt recognize.It wasnt likely a memorial for an OrsianI couldnt imagine anyone in the lower city adopting Radchaai funeral practices, or at least not anyone old enough to have died since Id seen them last.Near the memorial, on her collar, sat a small flower pin, each petal enameled with the symbol of an Emanation.A date engraved in the flowers center.This assured young woman had been the tiny, frightened flower bearer when Anaander Mianaai had acted as priest in Lieutenant Awns house twenty years ago.No coincidences, not for Radchaai.I was quite sure now that when we were admitted to the inspector supervisors presence, I would meet Lieutenant Awns replacement in Ors.This inspector adjunct was, perhaps, a client of hers.They make them for funerals, the adjunct was saying, still talking about memorial pins.Family and close friends wear them.And you could tell by the style and expense of the piece just where in Radchaai society the dead person stood, and by implication where the wearer stood.But the adjuncther name, I knew, was Daos Ceitdidnt mention that.I wondered then what Seivarden would makehad madeof changes in fashion since Garsedd, the way such signals had changedor not.People still wore inherited tokens and memorials, testimony to the social connections and values of their ancestors generations back.And mostly that was the same, except generations back was Garsedd.Some tokens that had been insignificant then were prized now, and some that had been priceless were now meaningless.And the color and gemstone significances in vogue for the last hundred or so years wouldnt read at all, for Seivarden.Inspector Adjunct Ceit had three close friends, all three of whom had incomes and positions similar to hers, to judge from the gifts theyd exchanged with her.Two lovers intimate enough to exchange tokens with but not sufficiently so to be considered very serious.No strands of jewels, no braceletsthough of course if she did any work actually inspecting cargo or ship systems such things might have been in her wayand no rings over her gloves.And there, on the other shoulder, where now I could see it plainly and look straight at it without being excessively impolite, was the token I had been looking for.I had mistaken it for something less impressive, had, on first glance, taken the platinum for silver, and its dependent pearl for glass, the sign of a gift from a siblingcurrent fashions misleading me.This was nothing cheap, nothing casual.But it wasnt a token of clientage, though the metal and the pearl suggested a particular house association.An association with a house old enough that Seivarden could have recognized it immediately.Possibly had.Inspector Adjunct Ceit stood.The inspector supervisor is available now, she said.I do apologize for your wait.She opened the inner door and gestured us through.In the innermost office, standing to meet us, twenty years older and a bit heavier than when Id last seen her, was the giver of that pinLieutenantno, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat Awer.18   It was impossible that Lieutenant Skaaiat would recognize me.She bowed, oblivious to the fact that I knew her.It was strange to see her in dark blue, and so much more sober, more grave than when Id known her in Ors.An inspector supervisor in a station as busy as this likely never set foot on the ships her subordinates inspected, but Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat wore almost as little jewelry as her assistant.A long strand of green and blue jewels coiled from shoulder to opposite hip, and a red stone dangled from one ear, but otherwise a similar (though clearly more expensive) scattering of friends, lovers, dead relatives decorated her uniform jacket.One plain gold token hung on the cuff of her right sleeve, just next to the edge of the glove, the placement that of something she intended to be reminded of, as much for herself to see as anyone else.It looked cheap, machine made.Not the sort of thing she would wear.She bowed.Citizen Seivarden.Honored Breq.Please sit.Will you have tea?Still effortlessly elegant, even after twenty years.Your assistant already offered us tea, thank you, Inspector Supervisor, I said.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat looked momentarily at me and then at Seivarden, slightly surprised, I thought.She had been addressing Seivarden primarily, thinking of Seivarden as the principal person between the two of us.I sat.Seivarden hesitated a moment and then sat in the seat beside me, arms still crossed to hide her bare hands.I wanted to meet you myself, citizen, Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat said, when shed taken her own seat.Privilege of office.It isnt every day you meet someone a thousand years old.Seivarden smiled, small and tight.Indeed not, she agreed.And I felt it would be improper for Security to arrest you on the dock.Though Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat gestured, placatory, the pin on her cuff flashing once as she did.You are in some legal difficulty, citizen.Seivarden relaxed, just slightly, shoulders lowering, jaw loosening.Barely detectable, unless you knew her.Skaaiats accent and mildly deferential tone were having an effect.I am, Seivarden acknowledged.I intend to appeal.Theres some question about the matter, then.Stilted.Formal.A query that wasnt a query.But no answer came.I can take you to the palace offices myself and avoid any entanglement with Security.Of course she could.Shed worked this out with Securitys chief already.Id be grateful.Seivarden sounded more like her old self than Id heard her in the last year.Would it be worth asking you to assist me contacting Geirs lord?Geir might conceivably have some responsibility for this last member of the house it had taken over.Hated Geir, which had absorbed its enemyVendaai, Seivardens house.Vendaais relations with Awer hadnt been any better than with Geir, but I supposed the request was a measure of just how desperate and alone Seivarden was.Ah.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat winced, just slightly.Awer and Geir arent as close as they used to be, citizen.About two hundred years ago there was an exchange of heirs.The Geir cousin killed herself.The verb Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat used implied that it hadnt been an approved, Medical mediated suicide but something illicit and messy.And the Awer cousin went mad and ran off to join some cult somewhere.Seivarden made a breathy, amused noise.Typical.Inspector Supervisor Skaaiat raised an eyebrow, but only said, temperately, It left some bad feeling on both sides.So my connections with Geir arent what they could be, and I might or might not be able to be helpful to you.And their responsibilities toward you might be difficult to determine, though you might find that useful in an appeal.
