Roger that.Begin your run.Let us know when we can limp over to one of the stations docks.Roger, Fred replied.Well find you a nice place to land.Fred out.Holden pulled the quick release on his chairs restraints and floated toward the ceiling, his body limp.Okay, Miller.Your turn.Oi, Pampaw, the kid in the crash couch to Millers right said.Popped seal, you and bang, hey?The kids combat armor was gray green, articulated pressure seals at the joints and stripes across the front plates where a knife or flechette round had scraped the finish.Behind the face mask, the kid could have been fifteen.His hand gestures spoke of a childhood spent in vacuum suits, and his speech was pure Belt creole.Yeah, Miller said, raising his arm.Saw some action recently.Ill be fine.Fines fine as fine, the kid said.But you hold to the foca, and neto can pass the air out to you, hey?No one on Mars or Earth would have the first clue what youre saying, Miller thought.Shit, half the people on Ceres would be embarrassed by an accent that thick.No wonder they dont mind killing you.Sounds good to me, Miller said.You go first, and Ill try to keep anyone from shooting you in the back.The kid grinned.Miller had seen thousands like him.Boys in the throes of adolescence, working through the normal teenage drive to take risks and impress girls, but at the same time they lived in the Belt, where one bad call meant dead.Hed seen thousands.Hed arrested hundreds.Hed watched a few dozen picked up in hazmat bags.He leaned forward to look down the long rows of close packed gimbaled crash couches that lined the gut of the Guy Molinari.Millers rough estimate put the count at between ninety and a hundred of them.So by dinner, chances were good hed have seen a couple dozen more die.Whats your name, kid?Diogo.Miller, he said, and gave the kid his hand to shake.The high quality Martian battle armor Miller had taken from the Rocinante let his fingers flex a lot more than the kids.The truth was Miller was in no shape for the assault.He was still getting occasional waves of inexplicable nausea, and his arm ached whenever the medication level in his blood started thinning out.But he knew his way around a gun, and he probably knew more about corridor to corridor fighting than nine tenths of the OPA rock jumpers and ore hogs like Diogo who were about to go in.It would have to be good enough.The ships address system clicked once.This is Fred.Weve had word from air support, and were green for breach in ten minutes.Final checks start now, people.Miller sat back in his couch.The clicking and chattering of a hundred suits of armor, a hundred sidearms, a hundred assault weapons filled the air.Hed been over his own enough times now; he didnt feel the urge to do it again.In a few minutes, the burn would come.The cocktail of high g drugs was kept on the ragged edge, since theyd be going straight from the couches into a firefight.No point having your assault force more doped than necessary.Julie sat on the wall beside him, her hair swirling around her like she was underwater.He imagined the dappled light flashing across her face.Portrait of the young pinnace racer as a mermaid.She smiled at the idea, and Miller smiled back.She would have been here, he knew.Along with Diogo and Fred and all the other OPA militia, patriots of the vacuum, shed have been in a crash couch, wearing borrowed armor, heading into the station to get herself killed for the greater good.Miller knew he wouldnt have.Not before her.So in a sense, hed taken her place.Hed become her.They made it, Julie said, or maybe only thought.If the ground attack was going forward, it meant the Rocinante had survived at least long enough to knock out the defenses.Miller nodded, acknowledging her and letting himself feel a moments pleasure at the idea, and then thrust gravity pushed him into his couch so hard that his consciousness flickered, and the hold around him dimmed.He felt it when the braking burn came, all the crash couches spinning to face the new up.Needles dug into Millers flesh.Something deep and loud happened, the Guy Molinari ringing like a gigantic bell.The breaching charge.The world pulled hard to the left, the couch swinging for the last time as the assault ship matched the stations spin.Someone was shouting at him.Go go go!Miller lifted his assault rifle, tapped the sidearm strapped to his thigh, and joined the press of bodies making for the exit.He missed his hat.The service corridor theyd cut into was narrow and dim.The schematics the Tycho engineers had worked up suggested they wouldnt see any real resistance until they got into the manned parts of the station.That had been a bad guess.Miller staggered in with the other OPA soldiers in time to see an automatic defense laser cut the first rank in half.Team three!Gas it!Fred snapped in all their ears, and half a dozen blooms of thick white anti laser smoke burst into the close air.The next time a defense laser fired, the walls flashed with mad iridescence, and the smoke of burning plastic filled the air, but no one died.Miller pressed forward and up a red metal ramp.A welding charge flared, and a service door swung open.The corridors of Thoth station were wide and roomy, with long swaths of ivy grown in carefully tended spirals, niches every few feet with tastefully lit bonsai.Soft light the pure white of sunlight made the place feel like a spa or a rich mans private residence.The floors were carpet.The HUD in his armor flickered, marking the path the assault was meant to take.Millers heart stepped up to a fast, constant flutter, but his mind seemed to grow perfectly still.At the first intersection, a riot barrier was manned by a dozen men in Protogen security uniforms.The OPA troops hung back, using the curve of the ceiling as cover.What suppressing fire there was came in kneecap low.The grenades were perfectly round, not even a hole where the pin had been pulled.They didnt roll as well on the soft industrial carpet as they would have on stone or tiling, so one of the three went off before it reached the barrier.The concussion was like being hit in the ears with a hammer; the narrow, sealed corridors channeled the blast back at them almost as much as at the enemy.But the riot barrier shattered, and the Protogen security men fell back.As they all rushed forward, Miller heard his new, temporary compatriots whooping with the first taste of victory.The sound was muffled, as if they were a long way away.Maybe his earpieces hadnt dampened the blast as much as they were supposed to.Making the rest of the assault with blown eardrums wouldnt be easy.But then Fred came on, and his voice was clear enough.Do not advance!Hold back!It was almost enough.The OPA ground force hesitated, Freds orders pulling at them like a leash.These werent troops.They werent even cops.They were a Belter irregular militia; discipline and respect for authority werent natural to them.They slowed.They got careful.So rounding the corner, they didnt walk into the trap.The next corridor was long and straight, leading the HUD suggested to a service ramp up toward the control center.It looked empty, but a third of the way to the curve horizon, the carpeting started to fly apart in ragged tufts.One of the boys beside Miller grunted and went down.They are using low shrapnel rounds and bouncing them off the curve, Fred said into all their ears at once.Bank shot ricochet.Stay low, and do exactly as I say.The calm in the Earthers voice had more effect than his shouting had.Miller thought he might have been imagining it, but there also seemed to be a deeper tone.A certainty.The Butcher of Anderson Station doing what he did best, leading his troops against the tactics and strategies hed helped create back when hed been the enemy.Slowly, the OPA forces moved forward, up one level, and then the next, then the next.The air grew hazy with smoke and ablated paneling.The wide corridors opened into broad plazas and squares, as airy as prison yards, with the Protogen forces in the guard towers.The side corridors were locked down, local security trying to channel them into situations where they could be caught in crossfire.It didnt work.The OPA forced open the doors, taking cover in display rich rooms, something between lecture halls and manufacturing complexes.Twice, unarmored civilians, still at their work despite the ongoing assault, attacked them when they entered.The OPA boys mowed them down.Part of Millers mind the part that was still a cop and not a soldier twitched at that.They were civilians.Killing them was, at the very least, bad form.But then Julie whispered in the back of his mind, No one here is innocent, and he had to agree.The operations center was a third of the way up the stations slight gravity well, defended better than anything they had seen so far.Miller and five others, directed by the all knowing voice of Fred, took cover in a narrow service corridor, keeping a steady suppressing fire up the main corridor toward ops, and making sure no Protogen counterattack would go unanswered.Miller checked his assault weapon and was surprised to see how much ammunition was left.Oi, Pampaw, the kid next to him said, and Miller smiled, recognizing Diogos voice behind the face mask.Days the day, passa?Ive seen worse, Miller agreed, then paused.He tried to scratch his injured elbow, but the armor plates kept anything satisfying from happening.Beccas tu?Diogo asked.No, Im fine.Its just this place.I dont get it.It looks like a spa, and its built like a prison.The boys hands shifted in query.Miller shook his fist in response, thinking through the ideas as he spoke.Its all long sight lines and locked down side passages, Miller said.If I was going to build a place like this, Id   The air sang, and Diogo went down, his head snapping back as he fell.Miller yelped and wheeled.Behind them in the side corridor, two figures in Protogen security uniform dove for cover.Something hissed through the air by Millers left ear.Something else bounced off the breastplate of his fancy Martian armor like a hammer blow.He didnt think about raising his assault weapon; it was just there, coughing out return fire like an extension of his will.The other three OPA soldiers turned to help.Get back, Miller barked.Keep your fucking eyes on the main corridor!Im on this.Stupid, Miller told himself, stupid to let them get behind us.Stupid to stop and talk in the middle of a firefight.He should have known better, and now, because hed lost focus, the boy was  Laughing?Diogo sat up, lifted his own assault weapon, and peppered the side corridor with rounds.He got unsteadily to his feet, then whooped like a child whod just gotten off a thrill ride.A wide streak of white goo stretched from his collarbone up across the right side of his face mask.Behind it, Diogo was grinning.Miller shook his head.What the hell are they using crowd suppression rounds for?he said to himself as much as the boy.They think this a riot?Forward teams, Fred said in Millers ear, get ready.Were moving in five.Four.Three.Two.Go!We dont know what were getting into here, Miller thought as he joined the sprint down the corridor, pressing toward the assaults final target.A wide ramp led up to a set of blast doors done in wood grain veneer.Something detonated behind them, but Miller kept his head low and didnt look back.The press of bodies jostling in their ragtag armor grew thicker, and Miller stumbled on something soft.A body in Protogen uniform.Give us some room!a woman at the front shouted.Miller pushed toward her, cutting through the crowd of OPA soldiers with his shoulder and elbow.The woman shouted again as he reached her.Whats the problem?Miller shouted.I cant cut through this bitch with all these dick lickers pushing me, she said, lifting a cutting torch already glowing white at the edge.Miller nodded and slid his assault rifle into the sling on his back.He grabbed two of the nearest shoulders, shook the men until they noticed him, and then locked his elbows with theirs.Just need to give the techs some room, Miller said, and together they waded into their own men, pushing them back.How many battles, all through history, fell apart at moments like this?he wondered.The victory all but delivered until allied forces started tripping over each other.The welder popped to life behind him, the heat pressing at his back like a hand even in armor.At the edge of the crowd, automatic weapons gurgled and choked.Hows it going back there?Miller shouted over his shoulder.The woman didnt answer.Hours seemed to pass, though it couldnt have been more than five minutes.The haze of hot metal and aerosolized plastic filled the air.The welding torch turned off with a pop.Over his shoulder, Miller saw the bulkhead sag and shift.The tech placed a card thin jack into the gap between plates, activated it, and stood back.The station around them groaned as a new set of pressures and strains reshaped the metal.The bulkhead opened.Come on, Miller shouted, then tucked his head and moved through the new passageway, up a carpeted ramp, and into the ops center.A dozen men and women looked up from their stations, eyes wide with fear.Youre under arrest!Miller shouted as the OPA soldiers boiled in around him.Well, no youre not, but shit.Put your hands up and back away from the controls!One of the men tall as a Belter, but built solid as a man in full gravity sighed.He wore a good suit, linen and raw silk, without the lines and folds that spoke of computer tailoring.Do what they say, the linen suit said.He sounded peeved, but not frightened.Millers eyes narrowed.Mr.Dresden?The suit raised a carefully shaped eyebrow, paused, and nodded.Been looking for you, Miller said.* * *   Fred walked into the ops center like he belonged there.With a tighter set of the shoulders and a degrees shift of the spine, the master engineer of Tycho Station was gone, and the general was in his place.He looked over the ops center, sucking in every detail with a flicker of his eyes, then nodded at one of the senior OPA techs.All locked down, sir, the tech said.The stations yours.Miller had almost never been present to witness another mans moment of absolution.It was such a rare thing, and so utterly private that it approached the spiritual.Decades ago, this man younger, fitter, not as much gray in his hair had taken a space station, wading up to his knees in the gore and death of Belters, and Miller saw the barely perceptible relaxation in his jaw, the opening of his chest that meant that burden had lifted.Maybe it wasnt gone, but it was near enough.It was more than most people managed in a lifetime.He wondered what it would feel like if he ever got the chance.Miller?Fred said.I hear youve got someone wed like to talk to.Dresden unfolded from his chair, ignoring the sidearms and assault weapons as if such things didnt apply to him.Colonel Johnson, Dresden said.I should have expected that a man of your caliber would be behind all this.My name is Dresden.He handed Fred a matte black business card.Fred took it as if by reflex but didnt look at it.Youre the one responsible for this?Dresden gave him a chilly smile and looked around before he answered.Id say youre responsible for at least part of it, Dresden said.Youve just killed quite a few people who were simply doing their jobs.But maybe we can dispense with the moral finger pointing and get down to what actually matters?Freds smile reached all the way to his eyes.And what exactly would that be?Negotiating terms, Dresden replied.You are a man of experience.You understand that your victory here puts you in an untenable position.Protogen is one of the most powerful corporations on Earth.The OPA has attacked it, and the longer you try to hold it, the worse the reprisals will be.Is that so?Of course it is, Dresden said, waving Freds tone away with a dismissing hand.Miller shook his head.The man genuinely didnt understand what was going on.Youve taken your hostages.Well, here we are.We can wait until Earth sends a few dozen battleships and negotiate while you look down the barrels, or we can end this now.Youre asking me how much money I want to take my people and just leave, Fred said.If moneys what you want, Dresden said with a shrug.Weapons.Ordinance.Medical supplies.Whatever it is you need to prosecute your little war and get this over with quickly.I know what you did on Eros, Fred said quietly.Dresden chuckled.The sound made Millers flesh crawl.Mr.Johnson, Dresden said.Nobody knows what we did on Eros.And every minute I have to spend playing games with you is one I cant use more productively elsewhere.I will swear this: You are in the best bargaining position right now that you will ever have.There is no incentive for you to draw this out.And youre offering?Dresden spread his hands.Anything you like and amnesty besides.As long as it gets you out of here and lets us return to our work.We both win.Fred laughed.It was mirthless.Let me get this straight, he said.Youll give me all the kingdoms of the Earth if I just bow down and do one act of worship for you?Dresden cocked his head.I dont know the reference.The Rocinante docked with Thoth station on the last gasps from her maneuvering thrusters.Holden felt the stations docking clamps grab the hull with a thud, and then gravity returned at a low one third g.  The close detonation of a plasma warhead had torn off the outer door of the crew airlock and flooded the chamber with superheated gas, effectively welding it shut.That meant theyd be using the cargo airlock at the stern of the ship and spacewalking over to the station.That was fine; they were still in their suits.The Roci had more holes now than the air cycling system could keep up with, and their shipboard O2 supply had been vented into space by the same explosion that killed the airlock.Alex dropped from the cockpit, face hidden by his helmet, his belly unmistakable even in his atmosphere suit.Naomi finished locking her station and powering down the ship, then joined Alex, and the three of them climbed down the crew ladder to the ships aft.Amos was waiting there, buckling an EVA pack onto his suit and charging it with compressed nitrogen from a storage tank.The mechanic had assured Holden that the EVA maneuvering pack had enough thrust to overcome the stations spin and get them back up to an airlock.No one spoke.Holden had expected banter.Hed expected to want to banter.But the damaged Roci seemed to call for silence.Maybe awe.Holden leaned against the cargo bay bulkhead and closed his eyes.The only sounds he could hear were the steady hiss of his air supply and the faint static of the comm.He could smell nothing through his broken and blood clogged nose, and his mouth was filled with a coppery taste.But even so, he couldnt keep a smile off his face.Theyd won.Theyd flown right up to Protogen, taken everything the evil bastards could throw at them, and bloodied their noses.Even now OPA soldiers were storming their station, shooting the people whod helped kill Eros.Holden decided that he was okay with not feeling any remorse for them.The moral complexity of the situation had grown past his ability to process it, so he just relaxed in the warm glow of victory instead.The comm chirped and Amos said, Ready to move.Holden nodded, remembered he was still in his atmosphere suit, and said, Okay.Hook on, everyone.He, Alex, and Naomi pulled tethers from their suits and clamped them to Amos broad waist.Amos cycled the cargo airlock and flew out the door on puffs of gas.They were immediately hurled away from the ship by station spin, but Amos quickly got them under control and flew back up toward Thoths emergency airlock.As Amos flew them past the Roci, Holden studied the outside of the ship and tried to catalog repair requirements.There were a dozen holes in both her bow and aft that corresponded to holes all along the inside of the ship.The gauss cannon rounds the interceptor had fired probably hadnt even slowed appreciably on their path through the Roci.The crew was just lucky none of them had found the reactor and punched a hole in it.There was also a huge dent in the false superstructure that made the ship look like a compressed gas freighter.Holden knew it would match an equally ugly wound in the armored outer hull.The damage hadnt extended to the inner hull, or the ship would have cracked in two.With the damage to the airlock, and the total loss of their oxygen storage tanks and recycling systems, there would be millions of dollars in damage and weeks in dry dock, assuming they could make it to a dry dock somewhere.Maybe the Molinari could give them a tow.Amos flashed the EVA packs yellow warning lights three times, and the stations emergency airlock door cycled open.He flew them inside, where four Belters in combat armor waited.As soon as the airlock finished cycling, Holden pulled his helmet off and touched his nose.It felt twice its normal size and throbbed with every heartbeat.Naomi reached out and held his face still, her thumbs on either side of his nose, her touch surprisingly gentle.She turned his head from side to side, examining the injury, then let go.Itll be crooked without some cosmetic surgery, she said.But you were too pretty before anyway.Itll give your face character.Holden felt a slow grin coming on, but before he could reply, one of the OPA troops started talking.Watched the fight, hermano.You guys really kicked some ass.Thanks, said Alex.Hows it goin in here?The soldier with the most stars on his OPA insignia said, Less resistance than expected, but the Protogen securitys been fighting for every foot of real estate.Even some of the egg heads have been coming at us.Weve had to shoot a few.He pointed at the inner airlock door.Freds heading up to ops.Wants you people up there, pronto.Lead the way, Holden replied, his nose turning it into lee da way.* * *   Hows that leg, Cap?Amos asked as they walked along the station corridor.Holden realized hed forgotten about the limp his gunshot to the calf had left him.Doesnt hurt, but the muscle doesnt flex as much, he replied.Yours?Amos grinned and glanced down at the leg that still limped from the fracture hed suffered on the Donnager months earlier.No biggie, he said.The ones that dont kill you dont count.Holden started to reply, then stopped when the group rounded a corner into a slaughterhouse.They were clearly coming up behind the assault team, because now the corridor floor was littered with bodies, the walls with bullet holes and scorch marks.To his relief, Holden saw a lot more bodies in Protogen security armor than in OPA gear.But there were enough dead Belters on the floor to make his stomach twist.When he passed a dead man in a lab coat, he had to stop himself from spitting on the floor.The security guys had maybe made a bad decision in going to work for the wrong team, but the scientists on this station had killed a million and a half people just to see what would happen.They couldnt be dead enough for Holdens comfort.Something tugged at him, and he paused.Lying next to the dead scientist was what looked like a kitchen knife.Huh, Holden said.He didnt come at you guys with that, did he?Yeah, crazy, no?said one of their escorts.I heard of bringing a knife to a gunfight, but   Ops is up ahead, said the ranking trooper.Generals waiting.* * *   Holden entered the stations ops center and saw Fred, Miller, a bunch of OPA troops, and one stranger in an expensive looking suit.A line of technicians and operations staff in Protogen uniform had their wrists cuffed and were being led away.The room was covered deck to ceiling in screens and monitors, most of which were spooling text data too fast to read.Let me get this straight, Fred was saying.Youll give me all the kingdoms of the Earth if I just bow down and do one act of worship for you?I dont know the reference, the stranger said.Whatever else they were about to say stopped when Miller noticed Holden and tapped Fred on the shoulder.Holden could swear that the detective gave him a warm smile, though on his dour face it was hard to tell.Jim, Fred said, then gestured for him to come closer.He was reading a matte black business card.Meet Antony Dresden, executive VP of bio research for Protogen, and the architect of the Eros project.The asshole in the suit actually reached out like he was going to shake hands.Holden ignored him.Fred, he said.Casualties?Shockingly low.Half their security had non lethals, Miller said.Riot control.Sticky rounds.Like that.Holden nodded and then shook his head and frowned.I saw a lot of Protogen security bodies out there in the corridor.Why have so many guys and then give them weapons that cant repel boarders?Good question, Miller agreed.Dresden chuckled.This is what I mean, Mr.Johnson, Dresden said.He turned to Holden.Jim?Well then, Jim.The fact that you dont understand this stations security needs tells me that you have no idea what youve become involved with.And I think you know that as well as I do.As I was saying to Fred here   Antony, you need to shut the fuck up, Holden said, surprised by the sudden flush of anger.Dresden looked disappointed.The bastard had no right to be comfortable.Condescending.Holden wanted the man terrified, begging for his life, not sneering behind his cultured accent.Amos, if he talks to me again without being told to, break his jaw.My pleasure, Captain, Amos said, and took half a step forward.Dresden smirked at the ham fisted threat but kept his mouth shut.What do we know?Holden asked, aiming the question at Fred.We know the Eros data is coming here, and we know this piece of shit is in charge.Well know more once weve taken the place apart.Holden turned to look at Dresden again, taking in the blue blood European good looks, the gym sculpted physique, the expensive haircut.Even now, surrounded by men with guns, Dresden managed to look like he was in charge.Holden could imagine him glancing down at his watch and wondering how much more of his expensive time this boarding party was going to take.Holden said, I need to ask him something.Fred nodded.You earned it.Why?Holden asked.I want to know why.Dresdens smile was almost pitying, and he stuck his hands into his pockets as casually as a man talking sports at a dockside bar.Why is a very big question, Dresden said.Because God wanted it that way?Or perhaps you want to narrow it for me.Why Eros?Well, Jim   You can call me Captain Holden.Im the guy that found your lost ship, so Ive seen the video from Phoebe.I know what the protomolecule is.Really!Dresden said, his smile becoming half a degree more genuine.I have you to thank for turning the viral agent over to us on Eros.Losing the Anubis was going to put our timeline back months.Finding the infected body already there on the station was a godsend.I knew it.I fucking knew it, Holden thought.Out loud, he said, Why?You know what the agent is, Dresden said, at a loss for the first time since Holden had come into the room.I dont know what more I can tell you.This is the most important thing to ever happen to the human race.Its simultaneously proof that we are not alone in the universe, and our ticket out of the limitations that bind us to our little bubbles of rock and air.You arent answering me, Holden said, hating the way his broken nose made his voice slightly comical when he wanted to be threatening.I want to know why you killed a million and a half people.Fred cleared his throat, but he didnt interrupt.Dresden looked from Holden to the colonel and back again.I am answering, Captain.A million and a half people is small potatoes.What were working with here is bigger than that, Dresden said, then moved over to a chair and sat down, pulling up his pants leg as he crossed his knees, so as not to stretch the fabric.Are you familiar with Genghis Khan?What?Holden and Fred said at almost the same instant.Miller only stared at Dresden with a blank expression, tapping the barrel of his pistol against his own armored thigh.Genghis Khan.There are some historians who claim that Genghis Kahn killed or displaced one quarter of the total human population of Earth during his conquest, Dresden said.He did that in pursuit of an empire that would begin falling apart as soon as he died.In todays scale, that would mean killing nearly ten billion people in order to affect a generation.A generation and a half.Eros isnt even a rounding error by comparison.You really dont care, Fred said, his voice quiet.And unlike Khan, we arent doing it to build a brief empire.I know what you think.That were trying to aggrandize ourselves.Grab power.You dont want to?Holden said.Of course we do.Dresdens voice was cutting.But youre thinking too small.Building humanitys greatest empire is like building the worlds largest anthill.Insignificant.There is a civilization out there that built the protomolecule and hurled it at us over two billion years ago.They were already gods at that point.What have they become since then?With another two billion years to advance?With a growing dread, Holden listened to Dresden speak.This speech had the air of something spoken before.Perhaps many times.And it had worked.It had convinced powerful people.It was why Protogen had stealth ships from the Earth shipyards and seemingly limitless behind the scenes support.We have a terrifying amount of catching up to do, gentlemen, Dresden was saying.But fortunately we have the tool of our enemy to use in doing it.Catching up?a soldier to Holdens left said.Dresden nodded at the man and smiled.The protomolecule can alter the host organism at the molecular level; it can create genetic change on the fly.Not just DNA, but any stable replicator.But it is only a machine.It doesnt think.It follows instructions.If we learn how to alter that programming, then we become the architects of that change.Holden interrupted.If it was supposed to wipe out life on Earth and replace it with whatever the protomolecules creators wanted, why turn it loose?Excellent question, Dresden said, holding up one finger like a college professor about to deliver a lecture.The protomolecule doesnt come with a users manual.In fact, weve never before been able to actually watch it carry out its program.The molecule requires significant mass before it develops enough processing power to fulfill its directives.Whatever they are.Dresden pointed at the screens covered with data around them.We are going to watch it at work.See what it intends to do.How it goes about doing it.And, hopefully, learn how to change that program in the process.You could do that with a vat of bacteria, Holden said.Im not interested in remaking bacteria, Dresden said.Youre fucking insane, Amos said, and took another step toward Dresden.Holden put a hand on the big mechanics shoulder.So, Holden said.You figure out how the bug works, and then what?Then everything.Belters who can work outside a ship without wearing a suit.Humans capable of sleeping for hundreds of years at a time flying colony ships to the stars.No longer being bound to the millions of years of evolution inside one atmosphere of pressure at one g, slaves to oxygen and water.We decide what we want to be, and we reprogram ourselves to be that.Thats what the protomolecule gives us.Dresden had stood back up as hed delivered this speech, his face shining with the zeal of a prophet.What we are doing is the best and only hope of humanitys survival.When we go out there, we will be facing gods.And if we dont go out?Fred asked.He sounded thoughtful.Theyve already fired a doomsday weapon at us once, Dresden said.The room was silent for a moment.Holden felt his certainty slip.He hated everything about Dresdens argument, but he couldnt quite see his way past it.He knew in his bones that something about it was dead wrong, but he couldnt find the words.Naomis voice startled him.Did it convince them?she asked.Excuse me?Dresden said.The scientists.The technicians.Everyone you needed to make it happen.They actually had to do this.They had to watch the video of people dying all over Eros.They had to design those radioactive murder chambers.So unless you managed to round up every serial killer in the solar system and send them through a postgraduate program, how did you do this?We modified our science team to remove ethical restraints.Half a dozen clues clicked into place in Holdens head.Sociopaths, he said.You turned them into sociopaths.High functioning sociopaths, Dresden said with a nod.He seemed pleased to explain it.And extremely curious ones.As long as we kept them supplied with interesting problems to solve and unlimited resources, they remained quite content.And a big security team armed with riot control rounds for when they arent, Fred said.Yes, there are occasional issues, Dresden said.He looked around, the slightest frown creasing his forehead.I know.You think its monstrous, but I am saving the human race.I am giving humanity the stars.You disapprove?Fine.Let me ask you this.Can you save Eros?Right now.No, Fred said, but we can   Waste the data, Dresden said.You can make certain that every man, woman, and child who died on Eros died for nothing.The room was silent.Fred was frowning, his arms crossed.Holden understood the struggle going on in the mans mind.Everything Dresden said was repulsive and eerie and rang too much of the truth.Or, Dresden said, we can negotiate a price, you can go on your way, and I can   Okay.Thats enough, Miller said, speaking for the first time since Dresden had begun his pitch.Holden glanced over at the detective.His flat expression had gone stony.He wasnt tapping the barrel of his pistol against his leg.Oh, shit.Dresden didnt see it coming.Even as Miller raised the pistol, the mans eyes didnt register a threat.All he saw was Miller with an object in his hand that happened to be a gun.A dog would have known to be scared, but not Dresden.Miller!Holden shouted from a great distance.Dont!Pulling the trigger was simple.A soft click, the bounce of metal against his glove cushioned palm, and then again two more times.Dresdens head snapped back, blooming red.Blood spattered a wide screen, obscuring the data stream.Miller stepped close, fired two more rounds into Dresdens chest, considered for a moment, then holstered the pistol.The room was silent.The OPA soldiers were all looking at each other or at Miller, surprised, even after the press of the assault, by the sudden violence.Naomi and Amos were looking at Holden, and the captain was staring at the corpse.Holdens injured face was set as a mask; fury, outrage, maybe even despair.Miller understood that.Doing the obvious thing still wasnt natural for Holden.There had been a time when it hadnt come so easily for Miller either.Only Fred didnt flinch or look nervous.The colonel didnt smile or frown, and he didnt look away.What the fuck was that?Holden said through his blood plugged nose.You shot him in cold blood!Yeah, Miller said.Holden shook his head.What about a trial?What about justice?You just decide, and thats the way it goes?Im a cop, Miller said, surprised by the apology in his voice.Are you even human anymore?All right, gentlemen!Fred said, his voice booming out in the quiet.Shows over.Lets get back to work.I want the decryption team in here.Weve got prisoners to evacuate and a station to strip down.Holden looked from Fred to Miller to the still dying Dresden.His jaw was set with rage.Hey, Miller, Holden said.Yeah?Miller said softly.He knew what was coming.Find your own ride home, the captain of the Rocinante said, then spun and stalked out of the room, his crew following.Miller watched them walk away.Regret tapped gently at his heart, but there was nothing to be done about it.The broken bulkhead seemed to swallow them.Miller turned to Fred.Hitch a lift?Youre wearing our colors, Fred said.Well get you as far as Tycho.I appreciate that, Miller said.Then, a moment later: You know it had to be done.Fred didnt reply.There wasnt anything to say.* * *   Thoth Station was injured, but not dead.Not yet.Word of the sociopathic crew spread fast, and the OPA forces took the warning to heart.The occupation and control phase of the attack lasted forty hours instead of the twenty that it would have taken with normal prisoners.With humans.Miller did what he could with prisoner control.The OPA kids were well intentioned, but most of them had never worked with captive populations before.They didnt know how to cuff someone at the wrist and elbow so that the perp couldnt get his hands out in front to strangle them.They didnt know how to restrain someone with a length of cord around the neck so that the prisoner couldnt choke himself to death, by accident or intentionally.Half of them didnt even know how to pat someone down.Miller knew all of it like a game hed played since childhood.In five hours, he found twenty hidden blades on the science crew alone.He hardly had to think about it.A second wave of transport ships arrived: personnel haulers that looked ready to spill their air out into the vacuum if you spat on them, salvage trawlers already dismantling the shielding and superstructure of the station, supply ships boxing and packing the precious equipment and looting the pharmacies and food banks.By the time news of the assault reached Earth, the station would be stripped to a skeleton and its people hidden away in unlicensed prison cells throughout the Belt.Protogen would know sooner, of course.They had outposts much closer than the inner planets.There was a calculus of response time and possible gain.The mathematics of piracy and war.Miller knew it, but he didnt let it worry him.Those were decisions for Fred and his attachs to make.Miller had taken more than enough initiative for one day.Posthuman.It was a word that came up in the media every five or six years, and it meant different things every time.Neural regrowth hormone?Posthuman.Sex robots with inbuilt pseudo intelligence?Posthuman.Self optimizing network routing?Posthuman.It was a word from advertising copy, breathless and empty, and all hed ever thought it really meant was that the people using it had a limited imagination about what exactly humans were capable of.Now, as he escorted a dozen captives in Protogen uniforms to a docked transport heading God knew where, the word was taking on new meaning.Are you even human anymore?All posthuman meant, literally speaking, was what you were when you werent human anymore.Protomolecule aside, Protogen aside, Dresden and his Mengele as Genghis Khan self righteous fantasies aside, Miller thought that maybe hed been ahead of the curve all along.Maybe hed been posthuman for years.The min max point came forty hours later, and it was time to go.The OPA had skeletonized the station, and it was time to get out before anyone came along with vengeance in mind.Miller sat in a crash couch, his blood dancing with spent amphetamines and his mind slipping into and out of exhaustion psychosis.The thrust gravity was like a pillow over his face.He was vaguely aware that he was weeping.It didnt mean anything.In Millers haze, Dresden was talking again, pouring out promises and lies, half truths and visions.Miller could see the words themselves like a dark smoke, coalescing into the spilling black filament of the protomolecule.The threads of it were reaching toward Holden, Amos, Naomi.He tried to find his gun, to stop it, to do the obvious thing.His despairing shout woke him, and he remembered hed already won.Julie sat beside him, her hand cool against his forehead.Her smile was gentle, understanding.Forgiving.Sleep, she said, and his mind fell into the deep black.* * *   Oi, Pampaw, Diogo said.Acima and out, sabez?It was Millers tenth morning back on Tycho, his seventh hot bunking in Diogos closet sized apartment.He could tell from the buzz in the boys voice it would have to be one of the last.Fish and company start to smell after three days.He rolled off the thin bed, ran fingers through his hair, and nodded.Diogo stripped down and crawled into the bed without speaking.He stank of liquor and cheap tub grown marijuana.Millers terminal told him that the second shift had ended two hours before, the third shift halfway into its morning.He gathered his things in his suitcase, turned off the lights on Diogos already snoring form, and trundled out to the public showers to spend a few of his remaining credits trying to look less homeless.The pleasant surprise of his return to Tycho Station was the boost of money in his account.The OPA, meaning Fred Johnson, had paid him for his time on Thoth.He hadnt asked for it, and there was part of him that wanted to turn the payment down.If there had been an alternative, he might have.Since there wasnt, he tried to stretch the funds out as far as they would go and appreciate the irony.He and Captain Shaddid were on the same payroll after all.For the first few days after his return to Tycho, Miller had expected to see the attack on Thoth in the newsfeeds.EARTH CORPORATION LOSES RESEARCH STATION TO CRAZED BELTERS, or some such.He should have been finding a job or a place to sleep that wasnt charity.He meant to.But the hours seemed to dissolve as he sat in the bar or the lounges, watching the screens for just a few more minutes.The Martian navy had suffered a series of harassing attacks by Belters.A half ton of super accelerated gravel had forced two of their battleships to change course.A slowdown in water harvesting on Saturns rings was either an illegal work stoppage, and therefore treasonous, or the natural response to increased security needs.Two Earth owned mining operations had been attacked by either Mars or the OPA.Four hundred people were dead.Earths blockade of Mars was entering its third month.A coalition of scientists and terraforming specialists were screaming that the cascading processes were in danger, and that while the war would be over in a year or two, the loss of supplies would set the terraforming effort back generations.Everyone blamed everyone else for Eros.Thoth station didnt exist.It would, though.With most of the Martian navy still in the outer planets, Earths siege was a brittle thing.Time was getting short.Either the Martians would go home and try facing down the somewhat older, somewhat slower, but more numerous ships of Earth, or theyd go straight for the planet itself.Earth was still the source of a thousand things that couldnt be grown elsewhere, but if someone got happy or cocksure or desperate, it wouldnt take much to start dropping rocks down the gravity wells.All of it as a distraction.There was an old joke.Miller didnt remember where hed heard it.Girls at her own fathers funeral, meets this really cute guy.They talk, hit it off, but he leaves before she can get his number.Girl doesnt know how to track the guy down.So a week later, she kills her mom.Big laugh.It was the logic of Protogen, of Dresden, of Thoth.Here is the problem, they said to themselves, and there is the solution.That it was drowned in innocent blood was as trivial as the font the reports were printed in.They had disconnected themselves from humanity.Shut off the cell clusters in their brains that made life besides their own sacred.Or valuable.Or worth saving.All it had cost them was every human connection.Funny how familiar that sounded.The guy who walked into the bar and nodded to Miller was one of Diogos friends.Twenty years old or maybe a little south of that.A veteran of Thoth Station, just like Miller.He didnt remember the kids name, but hed seen him around often enough to know that the way he held himself was different than usual.Tight wound.Miller tapped the mute on his terminals newsfeed and made his way over.Hey, he said, and the kid looked up sharply.The face was tense, but a softer, intentional ease tried to mask it.It was just Diogos old grandpa.The one, everyone on Thoth knew, whod killed the biggest dick in the universe.It won Miller some points, so the kid smiled and nodded to the stool beside him.All pretty fucked up, isnt it?Miller said.You dont know the half, the kid said.He had a clipped accent.Belter by his height, but educated.Technician, probably.The kid tabbed in a drink order, and the bar offered up a glass of clear fluid so volatile Miller could watch it evaporate.The kid drank it down with a gulp.Doesnt work, Miller said.The kid looked over.Miller shrugged.They say drinking helps, but it doesnt, Miller said.No?Nope.Sex sometimes, if youve got a girl wholl talk to you after.Or target practice.Working out, sometimes.Liquor doesnt make you feel better.Just makes you not so worried about feeling bad.The kid laughed and shook his head.He was on the edge of talking, so Miller sat back and let the quiet do his work for him.He figured the kid had killed someone, probably on Thoth, and it was sneaking up on him.But instead of telling the story, the kid took Millers terminal, keyed in a few local codes, and handed it back.A huge menu of feeds appeared video, audio, air pressure and content, radiological.It took Miller half a second to understand what he was seeing.Theyd cracked the encryption on the Eros feeds.He was looking at the protomolecule in action.He was seeing Juliette Andromeda Maos corpse writ large.For a moment, his imagined Julie flickered beside him.If you ever wonder if you did the right thing shooting that guy, the kid said, look at that.Miller opened a feed.A long corridor, wide enough for twenty people to walk abreast.The flooring was wet and undulating like the surface of a canal.Something small rolled awkwardly through the mush.When Miller zoomed in, it was a human torso rib cage, spine, trailing lengths of what used to be intestines and were now the long black threads of the protomolecule pushing itself along on the stump of an arm.There was no head.The feed output bar showed there was sound, and Miller undid the mute.The high, mindless piping reminded him of mentally ill children singing to themselves.Its all like that, the kid said.Whole stations crawling with shit like that.Whats it doing?Building something, the kid said, and shuddered.I thought you should see it.Yeah?Miller said, his gaze nailed to the screen.What did I ever do to you?The kid laughed.Everyone thinks youre a hero for killing that guy, the kid said.Everyone thinks we should push every last prisoner we took off that station out an airlock.Probably should, Miller thought, if we cant make them human again.He switched the feed.The casino level where he and Holden had been, or else a section very like it.A webwork of something like bones linked ceiling and roof.Black sluglike things a yard long slithered up and between them.The sound was a hushing, like the recordings hed heard of surf against a beach.He switched again.The port, with bulkheads closed and encrusted with huge nautilus spirals that seemed to shift while he watched them.Everyone thinks youre a fucking hero, the kid said, and this time, it bit a little.Miller shook his head.Nah, he said.Just a guy who used to be a cop.* * *   Why should going into a firefight, charging into an enemy station filled with people and automatic systems built to kill you, seem less frightening than talking to people who you shipped with for weeks?And still.It was third shift, and the bar at the observation platform was set to imitate night.The air was scented with something smoky that wasnt smoke.A piano and bass dueled lazily with each other while a mans voice lamented in Arabic.Dim lights glowed at the bases of the tables, casting soft shadows up across faces and bodies, emphasizing the customers legs and bellies and breasts.The shipyards beyond the windows were busy as always.If he went close, he could pick out the Rocinante, still recovering from its wounds.Not dead, and being made stronger.Amos and Naomi were at a table in a corner.No sign of Alex.No sign of Holden.That made it easier.Not easy, but closer.He made his way toward them.Naomi saw him first, and Miller read the discomfort in her expression, covered over as quickly as it appeared.Amos turned to see what shed been reacting to, and the corners of his mouth and eyes didnt shift into a frown or a smile.Miller scratched his arm even though it didnt itch.Hey, he said.Buy you folks a round?The silence lasted a beat longer than it should have, and then Naomi forced a smile.Sure.Just one.Weve got that thing.For the captain.Oh yeah, Amos said, lying even more awkwardly than Naomi had, making his awareness of the fact part of the message.The thing.Thats important.Miller sat, lifted a hand for the waiter to see, and, when the man nodded, leaned forward with his elbows on the table.It was the seated version of a fighters crouch, bent forward with his arms protecting the soft places in his neck and belly.It was the way a man stood when he expected injury.The waiter came, and then beers all around.Miller paid for them with the OPAs money and took a sip.Hows the ship?he asked at last.Coming together, Naomi said.They really banged the hell out of her.Shell still fly, Amos said.Shes one tough bitch.Thats good.When  Miller said, then tripped on his words and had to start again.When are you folks shipping out?Whenever the captain says, Amos said with a shrug.Were airtight now, so could go tomorrow, if hes got someplace he wants to be.And if Fred lets us, Naomi said, and then grimaced like she wished shed kept silent.That an issue?Miller asked.Is the OPA leaning on Holden?Its just something I was thinking about, Naomi said.Its nothing.Look, thanks for the drink, Miller.But I really think wed better be going.Miller took a long breath and let it out slow.Yeah, he said.Okay.You head out, Amos said to Naomi.Ill catch up.Naomi shot a confused look at the big man, but Amos only gave back a smile.It could have meant anything.Okay, Naomi said.But dont be long, okay?The thing.For the captain, Amos said.No worries.Naomi rose and walked away.Her effort not to look back over her shoulder was visible.Miller looked at Amos.The lights gave the mechanic a slightly demonic appearance.Naomis a good person, Amos said.I like her, you know?Like my kid sister, only smart and Id do her if she let me.You know?Yeah, Miller said.I like her too.Shes not like us, Amos said, and the warmth and humor were gone.Thats why I like her, Miller said.It was the right thing to say.Amos nodded.So heres the thing.As far as the captain goes, youre dipped in shit right now.The scrim of bubbles where his beer touched the glass glowed white in the dim light.Miller gave the glass a quarter turn, watching them closely.Because I killed someone who needed it?Miller asked.The bitterness in his voice wasnt surprising, but it was deeper than hed intended.Amos didnt hear it or else didnt care.Because youve got a habit of that, Amos said.Capns not like that.Killing people without talking it over first makes him jumpy.You did a lot of it on Eros, but you know.Yeah, Miller said.Thoth Station wasnt Eros.Next place we go wont be Eros either.Holden doesnt want you around.And the rest of you?Miller asked.We dont want you around either, Amos said.His voice wasnt hard or gentle.He was talking about the gauge of a machine part.He was talking about anything.The words hit Miller in the belly, just where hed expected it.He couldnt have blocked them.Heres the thing, Amos went on.You and me, were a lot the same.Been around.I know what I am, and my moral compass?Ill tell you, its fucked.A few things fell different when I was a kid.I could have been those ass bandits on Thoth.I know that.Captain couldnt have been.Its not in him.Hes as close to righteous as anyone out here gets.And when he says youre out, thats just the way it is, because the way I figure it, hes probably right.Sure as hell has a better chance than I do.Okay, Miller said.Yeah, Amos said.He finished his beer.Then he finished Naomis.And then he walked away, leaving Miller to himself and his empty gut.Outside, the Nauvoo fanned a glittering array of sensors, testing something or else just preening.Miller waited.Beside him, Julie Mao leaned on the table, just where Amos had been.So, she said.Looks like its just you and me now.Looks like, he said.A Tycho worker in blue coveralls and a welding mask sealed up the hole in one of the galley bulkheads.Holden watched with his hand shielding his eyes from the harsh blue glare of the torch.When the plate steel was secured in place, the welder flipped her mask up to check the bead.She had blue eyes and a small mouth in a heart shaped pixie face and a mop of red hair pulled into a bun.Her name was Sam, and she was the team leader on the Rocinante repair project.Amos had been chasing her for two weeks now with no success.Holden was glad, because the pixie had turned out to be one of the best mechanics hed ever met, and hed hate for her to focus on anything other than his ship.Its perfect, he said to her as she ran one gloved hand over the cooling metal.Its okay, she said with a shrug.Well grind this down smooth enough, paint it nice, then youll never even know your ship had a boo boo.She had a surprisingly deep voice that contrasted with her looks and her habit of using mockingly childlike phrases.Holden guessed that her appearance combined with her chosen profession had led to a lot of people underestimating her in the past.He didnt want to make that mistake.Youve done amazing work, Sam, he said.He guessed Sam was short for something, but hed never asked and shed never volunteered.I keep telling Fred how happy we are to have you in charge of this job.Maybe Ill get a gold star in my next report card, she said while she put her torch away and stood up.Holden tried to think of something to say to that and failed.Sorry, she said, turning to face him.I appreciate your praise to the boss.And to be honest, its been a lot of fun working on your little girl.Shes quite a ship.The beating she took would have blown anything we own into scrap.It was a close thing, even for us, Holden replied.Sam nodded, then began putting the rest of her gear away.As she worked, Naomi climbed down the crew ladder from the upper decks, her gray coveralls hung with electricians tools.How are things up there?Holden asked.Ninety percent, Naomi said as she crossed the galley to the refrigerator and took out a bottle of juice.Give or take.She took out a second bottle and tossed it to Sam, who caught it one handed.Naomi, Sam said, raising the bottle in mock toast before downing half of it in one swallow.Sammy, Naomi said in return with a grin.The two of them had hit it off right away, and now Naomi was spending a lot of her off time with Sam and her Tycho crowd.Holden hated to admit it, but he missed being the only social circle Naomi had.When he did admit it to himself, like now, it made him feel like a creep.Golgo comp in rec, tonight?Sam said after shed gulped down the last of her drink.Think those C7 chumps are tired of getting their asses handed to them?Naomi said in return.To Holden, it sounded like they were speaking in code.We can throw the first one, Sam said.Get em hooked tight before we drop the hammer and wipe their roll.Sounds good to me, Naomi said, then tossed her empty bottle into the recycling bin and started back up the ladder.See you at eight, then.She tossed a little wave at Holden.Later, Captain.Holden said, How much longer, do you think?to Sams back as she finished with her tools.Sam shrugged.Couple days, maybe, to get her to perfect.She could probably fly now, if youre not worried about nonessentials and cosmetics.Thanks, again, Holden said, holding out his hand to Sam as she turned around.She shook it once, her palm heavily calloused and her grip firm.And I hope you mop the floor with those chumps from C7.She gave him a predatory grin.Its not even in doubt.* * *   Through Fred Johnson, the OPA had provided the crew with living quarters on the station during the renovation of the Roci, and over the past few weeks, Holdens cabin had almost come to feel like home.Tycho had money, and they seemed to spend a lot of it on their employees.Holden had three rooms to himself, including a bath and a kitchen nook off the public space.On most stations, youd have to be the governor to have that kind of luxury.Holden had the impression it was fairly standard for management on Tycho.He tossed his grimy jumpsuit into the laundry bin and started a pot of coffee before jumping into his private shower.A shower every night after work: another almost unthinkable luxury.It would be easy to get distracted.To start thinking of this period of ship repair and quiet home life as normalcy, not interlude.Holden couldnt let that happen.Earths assault on Mars filled the newsfeeds.The domes of Mars still stood, but two showers of meteors had pocked the wide slopes of Olympus Mons.Earth claimed that it was debris from Deimos, Mars that it was an intentional threat and provocation.Martian ships from the gas giants were burning hard for the inner planets.Every day, every hour brought the moment closer when Earth would have to commit to annihilating Mars or backing away.The OPAs rhetoric seemed built to ensure that whoever won would kill them next.Holden had just helped Fred with what Earth would see as the largest act of piracy in the history of the Belt.And a million and a half people were dying right now on Eros.Holden thought of the video feed hed seen of what was happening to the people on the station, and shuddered even in the heat of the shower.Oh, and aliens.Aliens that had tried to take over the Earth two billion years ago, and failed because Saturn got in the way.Cant forget the aliens.His brain still hadnt figured out a way to process that, so it kept trying to pretend it didnt exist.Holden grabbed a towel and turned on the wall screen in his living room while he dried off.The air was filled with the competing scents of coffee, humidity from the shower, and the faintly grassy and floral scent Tycho pumped into all the residences.Holden tried the news, but it was speculation about the war without any new information.He changed to a competition show with incomprehensible rules and psychotically giddy contestants.He flipped through a few feeds that he could tell were comedies, because the actors paused and nodded where they expected the laughs to be.When his jaw started aching, he realized he was gritting his teeth.He turned off the screen and threw the remote onto his bed in the next room.He wrapped the towel around his waist, then poured a mug of coffee and collapsed onto the couch just in time for his door to chime.What?he yelled at the top of his lungs.No one replied.Good insulation on Tycho.He went to the door, arranging his towel for maximum modesty along the way, and yanked it open.It was Miller.He was dressed in a rumpled gray suit hed probably brought from Ceres, and was fumbling around with that stupid hat.Holden, hey  he started, but Holden cut him off.What the hell do you want?Holden said.And are you really standing outside my door with your hat in your hands?Miller smiled, then put the hat back on his head.You know, I always wondered what that meant.Now you know, Holden replied.You got a minute?Miller said.Holden waited a moment, staring up at the lanky detective.He quickly gave up.He probably outweighed Miller by twenty kilos, but it was impossible to be intimidating when the person you were staring down was a foot taller than you.Okay, come in, he said, then headed for his bedroom.Let me get dressed.Theres coffee.Holden didnt wait for a reply; he just closed the bedroom door and sat on the bed.He and Miller hadnt exchanged more than a dozen words since returning to Tycho.He knew they couldnt leave it at that, as much as he might like to.He owed Miller at least the conversation where he told him to get lost.He put on a pair of warm cotton pants and a pullover, ran one hand through his damp hair, and went back out to the living room.Miller was sitting on his couch holding a steaming mug.Good coffee, the detective said.So, lets hear it, Holden replied, sitting in a chair across from him.Miller took a sip of his coffee and said, Well   I mean, this is the conversation where you tell me how you were right to shoot an unarmed man in the face, and how Im just too naive to see it.Right?Actually   I fucking told you, Holden said, surprised to feel the heat rise in his cheeks.No more of that judge, jury, and executioner shit or you could find your own ride, and you did it anyway.Yes.The simple affirmative took Holden off guard.Why?Miller took another sip of his coffee, then set the mug down.He reached up and took off his hat, tossed it onto the couch next to him, then leaned back.He was going to get away with it.Excuse me?Holden replied.Did you miss the part where he confessed to everything?That wasnt a confession.That was a boast.He was untouchable, and he knew it.Too much money.Too much power.Thats bullshit.No one gets to kill a million and a half people and get away with it.People get away with things all time.Guilty as hell, but something gets in the way.Evidence.Politics.I had a partner for a while, name of Muss.When Earth pulled out of Ceres   Stop, Holden said.I dont care.I dont want to hear any more of your stories about how being a cop makes you wiser and deeper and able to face the truth about humanity.As far as I can tell, all it did was break you.Okay?Yeah, okay.Dresden and his Protogen buddies thought they could choose who lives and who dies.That sound familiar?And dont tell me its different this time, because everyone says that, every time.And its not.Wasnt revenge, Miller said, a little too hotly.Oh really?This wasnt about the girl in the hotel?Julie Mao?Catching him was.Killing him   Miller sighed and nodded to himself, then got up and opened the door.He stopped in the doorway and turned around, real pain on his face.He was talking us into it, Miller said.All that about getting the stars and protecting ourselves from whatever shot that thing at Earth?I was starting to think maybe he should get away with it.Maybe things were just too big for right and wrong.Im not saying he convinced me.But he made me think maybe, you know?Just maybe.And for that, you shot him.I did.Holden sighed, then leaned against the wall next to the open door, his arms crossed.Amos calls you righteous, Miller said.You know that?Amos thinks hes a bad guy because hes done some things hes ashamed of, Holden said.He doesnt always trust himself, but the fact that he cares tells me he isnt a bad guy.Yeah  Miller started, but Holden cut him off.He looks at his soul, sees the stains, and wants to be clean, he said.But you?You just shrug.Dresden was   This isnt about Dresden.Its about you, Holden said.I cant trust you around the people I care about.Holden stared at Miller, waiting for him to reply, but the cop just nodded sadly, then put his hat on and walked away down the gently curving corridor.He didnt turn around.Holden went back inside and tried to relax, but he felt jumpy and nervous.He would never have gotten off Eros without Millers help.There was no question about it: Tossing him out on his ear felt wrong.Incomplete.The truth was Miller made his scalp crawl every time they were in the same room.The cop was like an unpredictable dog that might lick your hand or take a bite out of your leg.Holden thought about calling Fred and warning him.He called Naomi instead.Hey, she answered on the second chime.Holden could hear a bars frantic, alcohol fueled merriment in the background.Naomi, he said, then paused, trying to think of some excuse to have called.When he couldnt think of one, he said, Miller was just here.Yeah, he cornered Amos and me a while back.What did he want?I dont know, Holden said with a sigh.Say goodbye, maybe.What are you doing?Naomi asked.Want to meet up?Yes.Yes I do.* * *   Holden didnt recognize the bar at first, but after ordering a scotch from a professionally friendly waiter, he realized it was the same place hed watched Naomi sing karaoke to a Belter punk song what seemed like centuries before.She wandered in and plopped down across from him in the booth just as his drink showed up.The waiter gave her a questioning smile.Gah, no, she said quickly, waving her hands at him.Ive had plenty tonight.Just some water, thanks.As the waiter bustled away, Holden said, How did your, uh What exactly is Golgo, anyway?And how did it go?Game they play here, Naomi said, then took a glass of water from their returning waiter and drank half of it in one gulp.Like a cross between darts and soccer.Never seen it before, but I seem to be good at it.We won.Great, Holden said.Thanks for coming.I know its late, but this Miller thing freaked me out a bit.He wants you to absolve him, I think.Because Im righteous,  Holden said with a sarcastic laugh.You are, Naomi said with no irony.I mean, its a loaded term, but youre as close to it as anyone Ive ever known.Ive fucked everything up, Holden blurted out before he could stop himself.Everyone whos tried to help us, or that weve tried to help, has died spectacularly.This whole fucking war.And Captain McDowell and Becca and Ade.And Shed  He had to stop and swallow a sudden lump in his throat.Naomi just nodded, then reached across the table and took his hand in hers.I need a win, Naomi, he continued.I need to do something that makes a difference.Fate or Karma or God or whatever dropped me in the middle of this thing, and I need to know Im making a difference.Naomi smiled at him and squeezed his hand.Youre cute when youre being noble, she said.But you need to stare off into the distance more.Youre making fun of me.Yeah, she said.I am.Want to come home with me?I  Holden started, then stopped and stared at her, looking for the joke.Naomi was still smiling at him, nothing in her eyes but warmth and a touch of mischief.While he watched, one curly lock of hair fell over her eye, and she pushed it up without looking away from him.Wait, what?I thought youd   I said dont tell me you love me to get me into bed, she said.But I also said Id have gone to your cabin anytime you asked over the last four years.I didnt think I was being subtle, and Im sort of tired of waiting.Holden leaned back in the booth and tried to remember to breathe.Naomis grin changed to pure mischief now, and one eyebrow went up.You okay, sailor?she asked.I thought you were avoiding me, he said once he was capable of speech.Is this your way of giving me a win?Dont be insulting, she said, though there was no hint of anger in her voice.But Ive waited weeks for you to get your nerve up, and the ships almost done.That means youll probably volunteer us for something really stupid and this time our luck will run out.Well  he said.If that happens without us at least giving this a try once, I will be very unhappy about it.Naomi, I   Its simple, Jim, she said, reaching out for his hand and pulling him back toward her.She leaned across the table between them until their faces were almost touching.Its a yes or no question.Yes.Miller sat by himself, staring out the wide observation windows without seeing the view.The fungal culture whiskey on the low black table beside him remained at the same level in the glass as when hed bought it.It wasnt really a drink.It was permission to sit.There had always been a handful of drifters, even on Ceres.Men and women whose luck had run out.No place to go, no one to ask favors of.No connection to the vast net of humanity.Hed always felt a kind of sympathy for them, his spiritual kindred.Now he was part of that disconnected tribe in earnest.Something bright happened on the skin of the great generation ship a welding array firing off some intricate network of subtle connection, maybe.Past the Nauvoo, nestled in the constant hive like activity of Tycho Station, was a half degree arc of the Rocinante, like a home hed once had.He knew the story of Moses seeing a promised land he would never enter.Miller wondered how the old prophet would have felt if hed been ushered in for a moment a day, a week, a year and then dropped back out in the desert.Kinder never to leave the wastelands.Safer.Beside him, Juliette Mao watched him from the corner of his mind carved out for her.I was supposed to save you, he thought.I was supposed to find you.Find the truth.And didnt you?He smiled at her, and she smiled back, as world weary and tired as he was.Because of course he had.Hed found her, hed found who killed her, and Holden was right.Hed taken revenge.All that hed promised himself, hed done.Only it hadnt saved him.Can I get you anything?For half a second, Miller thought Julie had said it.The serving girl had opened her mouth to ask him again before he shook his head.She couldnt.And even if she had been able to, he couldnt afford it.You knew it couldnt last, Julie said.Holden.His crew.You knew you didnt really belong there.You belong with me.A sudden shot of adrenaline revved his tired heart.He looked around for her, but Julie was gone.His own privately generated fight or flight reaction didnt have room for daydream hallucinations.And still.You belong with me.He wondered how many people hed known who had taken that path.Cops had a tradition of eating their guns that went back to long before humanity had lifted itself up the gravity well.Here he was, without a home, without a friend, with more blood on his hands from the past month than from his whole career before it.The in house shrink on Ceres called it suicidal ideation in his yearly presentation to the security teams.Something to watch out for, like genital lice or high cholesterol.Not a big deal if you were careful.So hed be careful.For a while.See where it went.He stood, hesitated for three heartbeats, then scooped up his bourbon and drank it in a gulp.Liquid courage, they called it, and it seemed to do the trick.He pulled up his terminal, put in a connect request, and tried to compose himself.He wasnt there yet.And if he was going to live, he needed a job.* * *   Sabez nichts, Pampaw, Diogo said.The kid was wearing a meshwork shirt and pants cut in a fashion as youthful as it was ugly, and in his previous life, Miller would probably have written him off as too young to know anything useful.Now Miller waited.If anything could wring a prospect out of Diogo, it would be the promise of Miller getting a hole of his own.The silence dragged.Miller forced himself not to speak for fear of begging.Well  Diogo said warily.Well.Theres one hombre might could.Just arm and eye.Security guard works fine with me, Miller said.Anything that pays the bills.Il conversa  do.Hear whats said.I appreciate anything you can do, Miller replied, then gestured at the bed.You mind if I?Mi cama es su cama, Diogo said.Miller lay down.Diogo stepped into the small shower, and the sound of water against flesh drowned out the air cycler.Even on board ship, Miller hadnt lived in physical circumstances this intimate with anyone since his marriage.Still, he wouldnt have gone as far as to call Diogo a friend.Opportunity was thinner on Tycho than hed hoped, and he didnt have much by way of references.The few people who knew him werent likely to speak on his behalf.But surely thered be something.All he needed was a way to remake himself, to start over and be someone different from who hed been.Assuming, of course, that Earth or Mars whichever one came out on top of the war didnt then wipe the OPA and all the stations loyal to it out of the sky.And that the protomolecule didnt escape Eros and slaughter a planet.Or a station.Or him.He had a moments chill, recalling that there was still a sample of the thing on board the Roci.If something happened with it, Holden and Naomi, Alex and Amos might all join Julie long before Miller did.He told himself that wasnt his problem anymore.Still, he hoped theyd be all right.He wanted them to be well, even if he wasnt.Oi, Pampaw, Diogo said as the door to the public hall slid open.You hear that Eros started talking?Miller lifted himself to one elbow.S, Diogo said.Whatever that shit is, it started broadcasting.Theres even words and shit.Ive got a feed.You want a listen?No, Miller thought.No, I have seen those corridors.Whats happened to those people almost happened to me.I dont want anything to do with that abomination.Sure, he said.Diogo scooped up his own hand terminal and keyed in something.Millers terminal chimed that it had received the new feed route.Chic perdda in ops been mixing a bunch of it to bhangra, Diogo said, making a shifting dance move with his hips.Hard core, eh?Diogo and the other OPA irregulars had breached a high value research station, faced down one of the most powerful and evil corporations in a history of power and evil.And now they were making music from the screams of the dying.Of the dead.They were dancing to it in the low rent clubs.What it must be like, Miller thought, to be young and soulless.But no.That wasnt fair.Diogo was a good kid.He was just naive.The universe would take care of that, given a little time.Hard core, Miller said.Diogo grinned.The feed sat in queue, waiting.Miller turned out the lights, letting the little bed bear him up against the press of spin.He didnt want to hear.He didnt want to know.He had to.At first, the sound was nothing electric squeals and a wildly fluting static.Then, maybe somewhere deep in the back of it, music.A chorus of violas churning away together in a long, distant crescendo.And then, as clear as if someone were speaking into a microphone, a voice.Rabbits and hamsters.Ecologically unstabilizing and round and blue as moonbeams.August.It almost certainly wasnt a real person.The computer systems on Eros could generate any number of perfectly convincing dialects and voices.Mens, womens, childrens.And how many millions of hours of data could there be on the computers and storage dumps all through the station?Another electronic flutter, like finches looped back against themselves.A new voice feminine and soft this time with a throbbing pulse behind it.Patient complains of rapid heartbeat and night sweats.Symptom onset reported as three months previous, but with a history   The voice faded, and the throbbing rose.Like an old man with Swiss cheese holes in his brain, the complex system that had been Eros was dying, changing, losing its mind.And because Protogen had wired it all for sound, Miller could listen to the station fail.I didnt tell him, I didnt tell him, I didnt tell him.The sunrise.Ive never seen the sunrise.Miller closed his eyes and slid down toward sleep, serenaded by Eros.As consciousness faded, he imagined a body in the bed beside him, warm and alive and breathing slowly in time with the rise and fall of the static.* * *   The manager was a thin man, weedy, with hair combed high above his brow like a wave that never crashed.The office hunched close around them, humming at odd moments when the infrastructure water, air, energy of Tycho impinged on it.A business built between ducts, improvisational and cheap.The lowest of the low.Im sorry, the manager said.Miller felt his gut tighten and sink.Of all the humiliations the universe had in store for him, this one he hadnt foreseen.It made him angry.You think I cant handle it?he asked, keeping his voice soft.Its not that, the weedy man said.Its Look, between us, were looking for a thumb, you know?Someones idiot kid brother could guard this warehouse.Youve got all this experience.What do we need with riot control protocols?Or investigative procedure?I mean, come on.This gig doesnt even come with a gun.I dont care, Miller said.I need something.The weedy man sighed and gave the exaggerated shrug of a Belter.You need something else, he said.Miller tried not to laugh, afraid it would sound like despair.He stared at the cheap plastic wall behind the manager until the guy started to get uncomfortable.It was a trap.He was too experienced to start over.He knew too much, so there was no going back and doing fresh beginnings.All right, he said at last, and the manager across the desk from him let out a breath, then had the good grace to look embarrassed.Can I just ask, the weedy man said.Why did you leave your old job?Ceres changed hands, Miller said, putting on his hat.I wasnt on the new team.That was all.Ceres?The manager looked confused, which in turn confused Miller.He glanced down at his own hand terminal.There was his work history, just the way hed presented it.The manager couldnt have missed it.Thats where I was, Miller said.For the police thing.But I meant the last job.I mean, Ive been around, I understand not putting OPA work on your resume, but you have to figure we all know that you were part of the thing you know, with the station.And all.You think I was working for the OPA, Miller said.The weedy man blinked.You were, he said.Which, after all, was true.* * *   Nothing had changed in Fred Johnsons office, and everything had.The furnishings, the smell of the air, the sense of its existing somewhere between a boardroom and a command and control center.The generation ship outside the window might have been half a percent closer to completion, but that wasnt it.The stakes of the game had shifted, and what had been a war was something else now.Something bigger.It shone in Freds eyes and tightened his shoulders.We could use a man with your skills, Fred agreed.Its always the small scale things that trip you up.How to frisk someone.That kind of thing.Tycho security can handle themselves, but once were off our station and shooting our way into someone elses, not as much.Is that something youre looking to do more of?Miller said, trying to make it a casual joke.Fred didnt answer.For a moment, Julie stood at the generals side.Miller saw the pair of them reflected in the screens, the man pensive, the ghost amused.Maybe Miller had gotten it wrong from the start, and the divide between the Belt and the inner planets was something besides politics and resource management.He knew as well as anyone that the Belt offered a harder, more dangerous life than Mars or Earth provided.And yet it called these people the best people out of humanitys gravity wells to cast themselves into the darkness.The impulse to explore, to stretch, to leave home.To go as far as possible out into the universe.And now that Protogen and Eros offered the chance to become gods, to recreate humanity into beings that could go beyond merely human hopes and dreams, it occurred to Miller how hard it would be for men like Fred to turn that temptation away.You killed Dresden, Fred said.Thats a problem.It needed to happen.Im not sure it did, Fred replied, but his voice was careful.Testing.Miller smiled, a little sadly.Thats why it needed to happen, he said.The small, coughing laugh told Miller that Fred understood him.When the general turned back to consider him again, his gaze was steady.When it comes to the negotiating table, someones going to have to answer for it.You killed a defenseless man.I did, Miller said.When the time comes, I will hand feed you to the wolves as the first chip I offer.I wont protect you.Wouldnt ask you to protect me, Miller said.Even if it meant being a Belter ex cop in an Earth side prison?It was a euphemism, and they both knew it.You belong with me, Julie said.And so what did it matter, really, how he got there?Ive got no regrets, he said, and half a breath later was shocked to discover it was almost true.If theres a judge out there who wants to ask me about something, Ill answer.Im looking for a job here, not protection.Fred sat in his chair, eyes narrow and thoughtful.Miller leaned forward in his seat.Youve got me in a hard position, Fred said.Youre saying all the right things.But I have a hard time trusting that youd follow through.Keeping you on the books would be risky.It could undermine my position in the peace negotiations.Its a risk, Miller said.But Ive been on Eros and Thoth station.I flew on the Rocinante with Holden and his crew.When it comes to analysis of the protomolecule and how we got into this mess, there isnt anyone in a better position to give you information.You can argue I knew too much.That I was too valuable to let go.Or too dangerous.Sure.Or that.They were silent for a moment.On the Nauvoo, a bank of lights glittered in a gold and green test pattern and then went dark.Security consultant, Fred said.Independent.I wont give you a rank.Im too dirty for the OPA, Miller thought with a glow of amusement.If it comes with my own bunk, Ill take it, he said.It was only until the war was over.After that, he was meat for the machine.That was fine.Fred leaned back.His chair hissed softly into its new configuration.All right, Fred said.Heres your first job.Give me your analysis.Whats my biggest problem?Containment, Miller said.You think I cant keep the information about Thoth station and the protomolecule quiet?Of course you cant, Miller said.For one thing, too many people already know.For another thing, one of thems Holden, and if he hasnt already broadcast the whole thing on every empty frequency, he will soon.And besides that, you cant make a peace deal without explaining what the hells going on.Sooner or later, it has to come out.And what do you advise?For a moment, Miller was back in the darkness, listening to the gibbers of the dying station.The voices of the dead calling to him from across the vacuum.Defend Eros, he said.All sides are going to want samples of the protomolecule.Locking down access is going to be the only way you get yourself a seat at that table.Fred chuckled.Nice thought, he said.But how do propose we defend something the size of Eros Station if Earth and Mars bring their navies to bear?It was a good point.Miller felt a tug of sorrow.Even though Julie Mao his Julie was dead and gone, it felt like disloyalty to say it.Then you have to get rid of it, he said.And how would I do that?Fred said.Even if we studded the thing with nukes, how would we be sure that no little scrap of the thing would make its way to a colony or down a well?Blowing that thing up would be like blowing dandelion fluff into the breeze.Miller had never seen a dandelion, but he saw the problem.Even the smallest portion of the goo filling Eros might be enough to start the whole evil experiment over again.And the goo thrived on radiation; simply cooking the station might hurry the thing along its occult path rather than end it.To be sure that the protomolecule on Eros never spread, theyd need to break everything on the station down to its constituent atoms  Oh, Miller said.Oh?Yeah.Youre not going to like this.Try me.Okay.You asked.You drive Eros into the sun.Into the sun, Fred said.Do you have any idea how much mass were talking about here?Miller nodded to the wide, clear expanse of window, to the construction yards beyond it.To the Nauvoo.Big engines on that thing, Miller said.Get some fast ships out to the station, make sure no one can get in before you get there.Run the Nauvoo into Eros Station.Knock it sunward.Freds gaze turned inward as he planned, calculated.Got to make sure no one gets into it until it hits corona.Thatll be hard, but Earth and Mars are both just as interested in keeping the other guy from having it as in getting it themselves.Im sorry I couldnt do better, Julie, he thought.But itll be a hell of a funeral.Freds breath grew slow and deep, his gaze flickering as if he were reading something in the air that only he could see.Miller didnt interrupt, even when the silence got heavy.It was almost a minute later that Fred let out a short, percussive breath.The Mormons are going to be pissed, he said.Naomi talked in her sleep.It was one of a dozen things Holden hadnt known about her before tonight.Even though theyd slept in crash couches a few feet apart on many occasions, hed never heard it.Now, with her face against his bare chest, he could feel her lips move and the soft, punctuated exhalations of her words.He couldnt hear what she was saying.She also had a scar on her back, just above her left buttock.It was three inches long and had the uneven edges and rippling that came from a tear rather than a slice.Naomi would never get herself knifed in a bar fight, so it had to have come on the job.Maybe she had been climbing through tight spaces in the engine room when the ship maneuvered unexpectedly.A competent plastic surgeon could have made it invisible in one visit.That she hadnt bothered and clearly didnt care was another thing he had learned about her tonight.She stopped murmuring and smacked her lips a few times, then said, Thirsty.Holden slid out from under her and headed for the kitchen, knowing that this was the obsequiousness that always accompanied a new lover.For the next couple of weeks, he wouldnt be able to stop himself from fulfilling every whim Naomi might have.It was a behavior some men carried at the genetic level, their DNA wanting to make sure that first time wasnt just a fluke.Her room was laid out differently than his, and the unfamiliarity made him clumsy in the dark.He fumbled around for a few minutes in her small kitchen nook, looking for a glass.By the time he found it, filled it, and headed back into the bedroom, Naomi was sitting up in bed.The sheet lay pooled on her lap.The sight of her half nude in the dimly lit room gave him an embarrassingly sudden erection.Naomi panned her gaze up his body, pausing at his midsection, then at the water glass, and said, Is that for me?Holden didnt know which thing she was asking about, so he just said, Yes.* * *   You asleep?Naomis face was on his belly, her breathing slow and deep, but to his surprise she said, No.Can we talk?Naomi rolled off him and pulled herself up until her face lay next to his on the pillow.Her hair fell across her eyes, and Holden reached out and brushed it away in a move that felt so intimate and proprietary that he had to swallow a lump in his throat.Are you about to get serious on me?she asked, her eyes half lidded.Yeah, I am, he said, and kissed her forehead.My last lover was over a year ago, she said.Im a serial monogamist, so as far as Im concerned, this is an exclusive rights deal until one of us decides it isnt.As long as I get advance warning that youve decided to end the deal, there wont be any hard feelings.Im open to the idea of it being more than just sex, but in my experience that will happen on its own if its going to.I have eggs in storage on Europa and Luna, if that matters to you.She rolled up onto her elbow, her face hovering over his.Did I cover all the bases?she asked.No, he said.But I agree to the conditions.She flopped onto her back, letting out a long contented sigh.Good.Holden wanted to hold her, but he felt too hot and sticky with sweat, so he just reached down and held her hand instead.He wanted to tell her that this meant something, that it was already more than sex for him, but all the words he tried out in his head came off sounding phony or maudlin.Thank you, he said instead, but she was already snoring quietly.* * *   They had sex again in the morning.After a long night with too little sleep, it wound up being far more effort than release for Holden, but there was a pleasure in that too, as if less than mind blowing sex somehow meant something different and funnier and gentler than what theyd already done together.Afterward, Holden went to the kitchen and made coffee, then brought it back to bed on a tray.They drank it without talking, some of the shyness theyd avoided the night before coming now in the artificial morning of the rooms LEDs.Naomi put her empty coffee cup down and touched the badly healed lump in his recently broken nose.Is it hideous?Holden asked.No, she said.You were too perfect before.It makes you seem more substantial.Holden laughed.That sounds like a word you use to describe a fat man or a history professor.Naomi smiled and touched his chest lightly with her fingertips.It wasnt an attempt to arouse, just the exploration that came when satiation had removed sex from the equation.Holden tried to remember the last time the cold sanity following sex had been this comfortable, but maybe that had been never.He was making plans to spend the remainder of the day in Naomis bed, running through a mental list of restaurants on the station that delivered, when his terminal began buzzing on the nightstand.God dammit, he said.You dont have to answer, Naomi replied, and moved her explorations to his belly.Youve been paying attention the last couple months, right?Holden said.Unless its a wrong number, then its probably some end of the solar system type shit and we have five minutes to evacuate the station.Naomi kissed his ribs, which simultaneously tickled him and caused him to question his assumptions about his own refractory period.Thats not funny, she said.Holden sighed and picked up the terminal off the table.Freds name flashed as it buzzed again.Its Fred, he said.Naomi stopped kissing him and sat up.Yeah, then its probably not good news.Holden tapped on the screen to accept the call and said, Fred.Jim.Come see me as soon as you get a chance.Its important.Okay, Holden replied.Be there in half an hour.He ended the call and tossed his hand terminal across the room onto the pile of clothes hed left at the foot of the bed.Going to shower, then go see what Fred wants, he said, pulling off the sheet and getting up.Should I come, too?Naomi asked.Are you kidding?Im never letting you out of my sight again.Dont get creepy on me, Naomi replied, but she was smiling when she said it.* * *   The first unpleasant surprise was Miller sitting in Freds office when they arrived.Holden nodded at the man once, then said to Fred, Were here.Whats up?Fred gestured for them to sit, and when they had, he said, Weve been discussing what to do about Eros.Holden shrugged.Okay.What about it?Miller thinks that someone will try to land there and recover some samples of the protomolecule.I have no trouble believing that someone will be that stupid, Holden said with a nod.Fred stood up and tapped something on his desk.The screens that normally showed a view of the Nauvoo construction outside suddenly switched to a 2 D map of the solar system, tiny lights of different colors marking fleet positions.An angry swarm of green dots surrounded Mars.Holden assumed that meant the greens were Earth ships.There were a lot of red and yellow dots in the Belt and outer planets.Red was probably Mars, then.Nice map, Holden said.Accurate?Reasonably, Fred said.With a few quick taps on his desk, he zoomed in on one portion of the Belt.A potato shaped lump labeled EROS filled the middle of the screen.Two tiny green dots inched toward it from several meters away.That is the Earth science vessel Charles Lyell moving toward Eros at full burn.Shes accompanied by what we think is a Phantom class escort ship.The Rocis Earth navy cousin, Holden said.Well, the Phantom class is an older model, and largely relegated to rear echelon assignments, but still more than a match for anything the OPA can quickly field, Fred replied.Exactly the sort of ship that would be escorting science ships around, though, Holden said.Howd they get out there so quick?And why just the two of them?Fred backed the map up until it was a distant view of the entire solar system again.Dumb luck.The Lyell was returning to Earth from doing non Belt asteroid mapping when it diverted course toward Eros.It was close; no one else was.Earth must have seen a chance to grab a sample while everyone else was figuring out what to do.Holden looked over at Naomi, but her face was unreadable.Miller was staring at him like an entomologist trying to figure out exactly where the pin went.So they know, then?Holden said.About Protogen and Eros?We assume so, Fred said.You want us to chase them away?I mean, I think we can, but that will only work until Earth can reroute a few more ships to back them up.We wont be able to buy much time.Fred smiled.We wont need much, he said.We have a plan.Holden nodded, waiting to hear it, but Fred sat down and leaned back in his chair.Miller stood up and changed the view on the screen to a close up of the surface of Eros.Now we get to find out why Fred is keeping this jackal around, Holden thought, but said nothing.Miller pointed at the picture of Eros.Eros is an old station.Lots of redundancy.Lot of holes in her skin, mostly small maintenance airlocks, the former detective said.The big docks are in five main clusters around the station.Were looking at sending six supply freighters to Eros, along with the Rocinante.The Roci keeps the science vessel from landing, and the freighters secure themselves to the station, one at each docking cluster.Youre sending people in?Holden said.Not in, Miller replied.Just on.Surface work.Anyway, the sixth freighter evacuates the crews once the others are docked.Each abandoned freighter will have a couple dozen high yield fusion warheads wired to the ships proximity detectors.Anything tries to land at the docks, and theres a few hundred megaton fusion explosion.It should be enough to take out the approaching ship, but even if it doesnt, the docks will be too slagged to land at.Naomi cleared her throat.Uh, the UN and Mars both have bomb squads.Theyll figure out how to get past your booby traps.Given enough time, Fred agreed.Miller continued as though he hadnt been interrupted.The bombs are just a second line of deterrence.Rocinante first, bombs second.Were trying to buy Freds people enough time to prep the Nauvoo.The Nauvoo?
