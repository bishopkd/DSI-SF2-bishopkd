The same hemisphere always leads the charge into the night, and black dust shed by the retrograde moon Phoebe (the other one out of the plane of the rings) therefore always falls on that side.In four billion years the dust has accumulated to a depth of only a few centimeters.Meanwhile the trailing hemisphere of the moon, gathering frost from the ice subliming off the darker leading side, is among the whitest ice in the whole system.The result is a two toned moon, the only one in the solar system.When people came to occupy Iapetus, the top of the equatorial band was smoothed and fitted with a rock and aluminum foundation.They then began to use seashell genes to shape the structures of the equatorial city.Some of the flat top of the bulge has been left open for spaceport runways and the like, but most of the bulge is now covered by a long clear gallery tent, placed over buildings that line the great boulevard of the High Street, alternating with farms, parks, gardens, and forests.As the air under the tent is always kept warm, the interior architecture can be very open, with Saturn often left visible, framed by gaps in ceilings and roofs.Seashell biomimicry allowed the builders to extract and deploy calcium under mantles, and these soft living tissues were genetically engineered to shapes that allowed the architects to layer bioceramic stuctures one on the next, building structure on structure, like corals, until the area under the tent by now is almost full.Like most bioceramics structures, the beveled and layered shapes have been induced to produce scalloping, fanning, notching, and other conchological features, so that the buildings look like great seashells stacked one on the next.Sydney is often referenced because of its iconic opera house, but in fact the bulge now looks more like a Great Barrier Reef made of scallops layered and everywhere holed, as if by tube worms, to let in the view of Saturn overhead.On the black hemisphere, Cassini Regio, the bulge bisects an area where people once upon a time went out in hoppers or rovers and blew the black dust away to make patterns out of exposed white ice.Anytime you can easily make such a contrast in the landscape, people have written out their thoughts for the universe to read.Before the Saturn League was formed, when the first arrivals from Mars had come for Titans nitrogen, and were exploring the other moons as well for whatever else might be plundered and taken back to the red planet, people had come here and etched white out of the black.An exhalation no stronger than a leaf blowers would do the job, and soon great fields of Cassini Regio were covered like Newspaper Rock with petroglyphs.There were white on black figures in abstract patterns, beasts, stick people, Kokopellis, writing in many different alphabets, portraits, landscape features, trees and other plants; on and on it went.Later some entire areas were cleared completely to white and then painted with collected black dust to a greater or lesser depth, achieving shadings that had a sometimes trompe loeil depth of field, proportioned for viewing such that they looked normal when viewed from the bulge, with others designed to be viewed from space.Graffiti on Iapetus!Later it was declared a mistake and a scandal, a moral stupidity, even a crime, in any case disgusting; and there were calls for the entirety of Cassini Regio to be reblacked.Someday it may happen, but dont hold your breath, for the truth is we are here to inscribe ourselves on the universe, and it is not inappropriate to remind ourselves of this when blank slates are given us.All landscape art reminds us: we live in a tabula rasa, and must write on it.It is our world, and its beauty is entirely inside our heads.Even today people will sometimes go out over the horizon and scuff their initials in the dust.WAHRAM AT HOME  Wahram returned to Saturn a haunted androgyn.Despite all his theories, he was still in the tunnel.He tried to get back into the pseudoiterative of his life on Iapetus, and indeed in some ways it was easy; it wasnt a life he was ever going to forget.For a day or two it was possible to feel odd to be in a city you hadnt been in for years and yet magically wake up knowing right where to go, the little grocery around the corner where you could get fresh bread and milk and all that; then the intervening years sloughed away and it was just home again.Off for the walk to work, down the long esplanade by the north window wall, overlooking the immense drop down the slope of the bulge.Black tipped whites at the border of the Cassini region: a vast Chinese landscape painting, black brush tips on white paper.At the notch of one little small square, the council offices were up in a squat clear walled tower, offices with lots of people he knew; it was like dropping back into an earlier reincarnation.He could reenact it meticulously; he could perform it like an actor in a play set in the previous century; he could make it a daily devotional, live ordinary life as a dj vu that he invoked himselfbut no.No.Because the much more strict pseudoiterative of the tunnel still filled his mind, and overlaid the sensations of the present moment.And as Iapetus in the present was for the most part an Iapetus reenacted, much more vivid to him was that more recent past consisting of what he had just lived through with his so mercurial friend.And he wondered about her.The mercurialities of Swan were infinite, but she had gone through quite a bit down there, and so had he.She had protected him at the elevator door, just as a matter of course, the obvious thing to do, with no time to think; just an animal response.And with far too much time to think, he had helped her through her radiation sickness.So when he thought he wasnt thinking of anything, he found himself whistling snatches of Beethoven, and hearing over it a skylark filigree of inhuman virtuosity.He wondered what they had really sounded like, and if Pauline had recorded the entire time and could carve out and play back the music they had madeanother kind of transcription.All those poor musicians Maybe a record was always a distorter of memory, not to be sought.Better to hear it by way of reenactment.He would only really hear it again if they did it again.No.He needed to think about something else, and bring himself into the present.Possibly he would see Swan again somewhere, and they would whistle then, or not.Probably not, this being the world.So recent or not, the past was the past; the present was the only reality.So really, it was necessary to start up a new pseudoiterative that did not rely so fully on his habits from three or four lives back.He needed a new Iapetus, with the memory of Swan properly encoded into it.So he would walk down High Street to the park with the best view of Saturn for an evening constitutional, for a communing with the great ringed god, and perhaps a chance to see Titan his true home spangling over the giant like a jewel; and just the act of trudging to the park would bring a whole host of feelings to him; and in the park a small gathering of musicians would pass around the chance to start up a tune and have everyone join in, and he could either listen, or venture to whistle alongeven to whistle the start of some movement when it was his turnend of the Sixth, end of the Seventhand they all would join in on their instruments and off they would go.With Saturn overhead, and some truly gifted musicians in the little band, he would be snagged by the moment, fully entangled, and Swan would be there with him in his mind.What a temper she had.Then on days when the council and various work groups werent meeting, he could tram around the city four degrees, and come to the gate for the ski boats, and get in one and take off down the gigantic side of the Iapetus bulge, in this region an undulant slope of black tipped white billows, in some parts like a shaken sheet of snow, in others like frozen waves in a waterslide.There were moguls the size of big hills.Down the great hill of the bulges side the ski boats would slide, carving lines and performing jumps and rollers, if desired; but also one could simply cut a line and keep to it on a long traverse, or even fly straight down the slope, a forty five degree drop, and even at the highest speed the descent took all day.Rides went on so long that many people slid down on larger boats to have a party, and on some days Wahram tried that too.Then at the bottom they got into funiculars for a ride back up, during which everyone was in high spirits, often expressed in song.People shared schnapps and sang Schubert.Wahram had done these things long before, in the first year he had lived in Iapetus, but somehow they had dropped out of his habits and been forgotten.Now thinking of Swan had brought them back into his life.Even his work brought Swan to mind, as the council and its staff were discussing what to do about the light deal with the Vulcanoids now that Terminator had been destroyed.Wahram pointed out to his colleagues that Terminator would be quickly rebuilt and repopulated, and thus remain a treaty partner with whom they already had an agreement.Alexs death did not change that agreement.He could see that while this was obviously the case, stating it aloud only tagged him among his colleagues as biased, which was true, so after that he went silent and only listened to what the others said about it, which really was nothing surprising: many of them had not liked the arrangement with Mercury in the first place, and now they reverted to these views and argued that they should be making their deals with some kind of Vulcanoid league, or even with individual Vulcanoids.These were not, after all, spaceships, but small asteroids located in the gravitationally stable orbit between .06 and .21 astronomical units from the sunthirty kilometer rocks, white hot on their sunward surfaces, and just big enough to spin out their solettas and contain in their interiors the little habitats that their operators or votaries lived in.These were city states just like any other city states, some of Wahrams colleagues insisted, and should not be represented by some exterior power like Terminator, no matter what Alex had asserted.How would the city states of the Saturn League like it if some Jovian party claimed to represent them just because it orbited between Saturn and the rest of civilization?Wasnt that ultimately the argument that Terminator had been making in this case?Wasnt this in fact yet another move in what some had called the Alexandrine Integration, the offline effort to bypass the AIs and unify the entire systemunder Alex?Not exactly, others had replied, to Wahrams relief, as he had been working with Alex on precisely this project, which was not exactly as characterized by these colleagues but would be difficult to explain in the context of that accusation.Much better to observe silently and let the argument drag on in the long and leisurely way typical of the council, until it had moved on its own to something else.The councilors from Hyperion and Tethys were the main reasons this would take a while; they were both very long winded, also maniacally focused on the minutiae of matters they took an interest in.The council was one of the many organizations in the Saturn League made up of drafted temporary workers, and the permanent staff there to assist them often had to Sir Humphrey the process along, guiding their employers invisibly through every decision.But some of the ministers, having been selected by lottery and assigned a years responsibility for the Saturn systems welfare, intended to be in full command of their own decisions, and to make the best decisions they could by being fully informed.Admirable in theory, it was painfully slow in practice.So in this discussion the dispute kept on seesawing between the idea that Mercury was the legitimate, or in any case agreed upon, broker in the matter, and furthermore could make things difficultand besides had things to offer Saturnand the idea that the Mercurials were interlopers who had succeeded in imposing a protection racket on the new little settlements inside it, and so should be finessed out of the deal in this their winter of discontent.Ultimately the council came to a conclusion Wahram had foreseen hours before: as Wahram himself was so sympathetic to the Mercurials, he was to return there and see what the situation was, talk to the lion cubs and find out who the next Lion would be, and then also go visit the Vulcanoids and see what they had to say for themselvessee what they thought of the arrangement Mercury had proposed to Saturn.He was instructed to revise Terminator out of the deal if he thought that would work.Probably he should have refused to do it based on his dislike for that last instruction, but it occurred to him that a different delegate might mean an even worse result for the Mercurials.And after all, the assignment meant he would very soon return sunward, which was interesting to contemplate.As for his instructions, he could see about that when he got there.In Alexs realm in particular, an ambassador was again as of old, a diplomat at large, charged with making decisions as well as conveying them.By the time he got there it could very well be a different story.With a little forethought, he could be almost sure it would be a different story.So he said nothing beyond a simple acceptance of the assignment.At which point the Satyr of Pan stood to speak.You must tell us if you think this effort will make trouble for the other projects Alex had going.Can you remind the council whats at stake here, and how those projects are going in her absence?Wahram nodded stiffly as he thought over his response.He and the other Alexandrines were attempting to keep a low profile, and some of the council members had not paid enough attention to notice their projects authorization and budgeting inside larger expenditures.Alex kept things separate in her calculations, so that wont be a problem for us.Some other matters are being dealt with by a group centered around Wang and Inspector Jean Genette.We would need to go under a cone of silence to discuss all this in detail, but suffice it to say, Alex was heavily involved with a Mondragon project to help Earth cope with its various problems by ecological means.A lot of the terraria in the Mondragon are working on that, it has its own momentum, and weve agreed to help them.Then also there is an investigation going on into the role of qubes in some questionable activities, on Mars, Venus, Io, and elsewhere.This also will proceed no matter what happens with the Vulcanoids, which is only an above and beyond, although admittedly an important one.The council, not wanting to retire into the cone and be cut off from the cloud and radio, adjourned the meeting.Wahram returned to his room.His crche kept an apartment in a little block of apartments, all clustered around a square that was occupied almost entirely by Titans, with Titanic shops and restaurants.There he lived among his crchemates and enjoyed their support, which was so benign and understanding that life there much resembled living in complete solitude.As the days passed before the spaceliner that would take him downsystem arrived, he walked the city spine to the council meetings, he followed the work on Titan in daily consultations, and he did his share of Iapetus work in the kitchen of the dining hall on the ground floor of their building.He attended a concert series, joined the little group of musicians in the park, filled and emptied dishwashers.As he dodged diners and servers in the hall, the repeated minuscule navigational challenges reminded him of Prousts comparison of a restaurant in action with the whirling planets of the solar system, which had struck him as fanciful (not to mention quite a scale shift between vehicle and tenor) until he had seen it for himself, in restaurant after restaurant: their affairs were elaborations of the second law of thermodynamics, Beckian diffusions of energy through the universe, and around they went in the great orrery of their lives.Soon he would descend sunward and seek out the Mercurial.But then she called him.She was coming to Saturn, with Jean Genette; they wanted to descend into the clouds of Saturn to look for a spaceship possibly adrift in the big beautys upper layers.She wanted him to arrange the dive into Saturn, if possible, and then join them in it.That would be fine, he replied; I am at your disposal.Which was certainly one way of putting it.Lists (8)  Prometheus, Pandora, Janus, Epimetheus, and Mimas; these are the moons that shepherd Saturns rings.The rings are only 400 million years old, the result of a passing Kuiper belt ice asteroid being stripped to its core when it passed Saturn too closely.Mimas, the bulls eye moon, is 400 kilometers in diameter, while its crater Herschel is 140.The Herschel impact nearly blew Mimas apart.Hyperion is a fragment of a similar collision that did blow a moon apart; it is shaped like a hockey puck.The impact caused flash steam explosions across a plane and split the moon as if spalling granite.The facet left behind is pocked like a wasps nest by a field of rimless dust filled craters.Pandora is shaped like a jelly bean.Tethys and Dione were both about 1,100 kilometers across (think France), both fractured all over their surfaces, etched by canyons with mile high walls.Tethyss Ithaca Chasma is twice as deep and four times as long as the Grand Canyon, and a thousand times older, very battered by Saturns everlasting civil wars.Dione, on the other hand, was disassembled by self replicating ice cutters in the 2110s, and the Hector sized segments were then directed downsystem to Venus.They struck Venus on a line parallel to the equator and provided Venus with a deep ocean bed and the water to fill it, while also knocking a good bit of the choking Venusian atmosphere off into space.Rhea is as wide as Alaska, with the usual plethora of craters, including fresh ones that throw bright ice rays out from their centers.Iapetus orbits seventeen degrees out of the plane of Saturns equator and thus has one of the best views of the rings; is therefore popular.The bulge is the biggest city in the Saturnian system.Epimetheus is a misshapen pile of loosely consolidated rubble.It switches orbits with the moon Janus every eight years; they are co orbital moons, very rarea sign of past impacts.Enceladus is covered by braided spills of ice.No cratersthe ice surface is too new, as it is continuously resurfaced from the liquid water ocean in the depths.Heat sources boil some of this carbonized water, creating geysers that shoot many kilometers into space.The water quickly freezes in its flight, and some of it makes it up to the slender E ring; the rest falls back down and under its own weight turns to firn and then back to ice again.A suite of microscopic life forms was discovered in the Enceladan ocean in the year 2244, and scientific stations have been established on its surface, as well as a cult of votaries who ingest a suite of the alien life forms, to unknown effect.There are twenty six irregular small moons.These are all Kuiper belt objects, captured as they crossed Saturns earliest gas envelope.Phoebe, at 220 kilometers across, is the largest of these, and it has a retrograde and highly inclined orbit, twenty six degrees out of the plane; thus another popular viewing platform.Titan, by far the largest Saturnian moon, is bigger than Mercury or Pluto.More about Titan later.Extracts (9)  One question for computability: is the problem capable of producing a result  If a finite number of steps will produce an answer, it is a problem that can be

around for him, and when she saw him, he waved, and then she did too, her expression pinched, he thought, her head tilted to the side.She looked at him in quick glancesshe didnt know how he would be.Suddenly he remembered that in the actual flesh she was a big bag of problems.He nodded a little deeper than he would have normally, trying to reassure her, and then thought that that might not be enough, and extended both hands, realizing as he did so that he was already back in a different world, Swancentric and intense.She threw herself on him in a rush, and he felt sure it looked like he was hugging back, or had even invited the hug.Jean Genette emerged from the lock and stood looking up at them, and Wahram greeted him with another bow.So you want to find one of the hanging ships?he said.They did.Apparently it might have something to do with the attack on Terminator.So Wahram led them across the spaceport to the gate for the railgun launcher angled to send ferries into polar orbits around Saturn.These orbits were popular for viewing the rings and the hexagonal storm at Saturns south pole.Wahram had already gotten permission from the authorities to take a cloud diver into the upper reaches of the planet; probably the council was happy to have him involved, as the Saturnian liaison to the incursion.They took off with only a pilot and crew aboard with them, and after they were cast toward the north pole, Swan and the inspector told Wahram what they had been doing since theyd left Mercury.Wahram, feeling uneasy that he could not fully reciprocate and tell them about his activities, given the councils orders, compensated by asking them a lot of questions about the investigation and its results so far.These turned out to be very interesting, even disturbing, and Wahram pondered to the point of a certain distraction the idea that there might be someone out there killing whole terraria.That the investigation had reduced their likeliest suspect pool to the population of Earth did not strike him as remarkable progress.All trouble comes from Earth, as the saying had it.The cloud diver was not a big ship, and though it was very fast, the trip still took long enough for Swan to begin to exhibit the signs of distress and antsiness he remembered so well.Then happily they were above Saturns north pole, looking down at the dark side of the rings, as it was the northern winter.From behind the sun the rings were peach in tone, the circumferential scoring so finely etched and yet so vast that one could not help being a bit taken aback.Even on their dark side the rings were far brighter than the nightside of the planet, making for an aura or halo effect of eldritch beauty, all framing the deep blue of Saturns winter north.Swan stared out the window, floating in her restraints, for the moment speechless.Wahram enjoyed this response, and not just because of the relief of the sudden silence.For him the polar view of Saturn was a perpetually glorious thing, the finest view in the solar system.Down they dove toward the big planet, until it lost its sphericity and became a gorgeous pastel cobaltthe blue floor of the universe, it seemed, with the black of space only slightly domed over it.It looked almost like two planes only slightly separated, blue and black, meeting at the horizon like planes in elliptic geometry.Soon after that they were down among the stupendous thunderhead armadas tearing east in this particular zone, around the seventy fifth latitude.Royal blue, turquoise, indigo, robins eggan infinity of blue clouds, it seemed.In the latitudinal band farther south the wind flew hard in the opposite direction; two thousandkilometerperhour jet streams were therefore running against each other, making the shear zone a wild space of whirlpooling tornadoes.It was important to keep a distance from such a violent interface, but as the latitudinal bands were thousands of kilometers wide, this was not difficult.Unlike Jupiter, there were no radiation fields created by the smaller giant, so over years a not insignificant population of floating ships had taken refuge in the upper clouds of Saturn; also some platform habitats, hung from immense balloons.The balloons had to be exceptionally large to provide any buoyancy, but once they did, the clouds provided shelter that was variously physical, legal, and psychological.The league kept track of these cloud floaters when possible, but if they sank deep enough in the clouds and went quiet, they could be elusive.Now their little diver flew among thunderheads a hundred kilometers tall, and though it was a commonplace to say that perspective was lost in situations like this, such that all sizes looked much the same, it wasnt really true: these thunderheads were clearly as big as entire asteroids, rising out of a deeper array of flatter cloud formations so that they saw below them masses of nimbus and cirrus, cumulus, festoons, bargesreally the whole Howard catalog, all snarling through and over and under each other and constituting what passed for the surface of the gas giant.Off to the distant south they could still sometimes make out the nearest shear line and its ripping tornado funnels, its broad domed hurricane tops.Sometimes in the middle of their own band they flew over a slower funnel and could look deep into the blue depths of the planet, gaseous for as far as they could see and much farther, but in appearance much like holes of mist that gathered at their bottoms to liquid.Every once in a while a high stray cloud would prove unavoidable, and the view out of the craft would suddenly reduce to a dim blue flashing, and a tumultuous tremor would buck the craft in ways that even the quickness of the pilot AIs could not entirely damp.They would tremble and toss until they regained the clear blue again, now bluer than ever.For the most part they moved downstream with the flow of the wind, but also made the occasional reach across it.Resisting the wind too much threw them around about as much as being inside a cloud.Ahead they could see their canyon of clear space narrowing until it was pinched to nothingness.Beyond that swirled a hurricane so big it could have floated the Earth on it like St.Brendans coracle.We have to go over that, their captain said, and with a sweet curve their craft ascended until the flat dome of the hurricane lay spinning below them.Overhead, the steady stars stood in their customary places.Are there fliers?Swan asked.Does anybody fly these cloud canyons in birdsuits?Wahram said, Yes, a few.Usually theyre scientists doing their work.Until recently it has been considered too dangerous to visit.So this space has not yet been cultured to the extent you are used to elsewhere.Swan shook her head.You probably just dont know about them.Perhaps.But I think I would.You dont come down here often yourself?No.Will you go flying down here with me?I dont know how to fly.You could let the birdsuits AI do it, and merely be a passenger making requests.Is it ever more than that?Of course it is.She gave him a disgusted look.People fly any space in the solar system that can be flown.Our bird brains demand it.Im sure they do.So youll go with me.She nodded as if she had won an argument and gotten a promise from him.Wahram tucked his chin into his neck.So you are a flier, then?Whenever I can.He didnt know what to say.If he was going to be badgered by this kind of peremptory bullying and yet still be expected to love her, then he refused!But it might be that it was already too late for that.The hooks were already in him pretty deep; he could feel them tugging in his chest; he was in fact hooked; he was very, very interested in whatever she might say or do.He was even willing to consider stupidities like birdflight in the clouds of Saturn.How could it be?To a woman not even his typeah, Marcel, if only you knewthis Swan was worse even than Odette.Maybe someday, he said, trying to sound agreeable.But right now we are looking for this ship of yours.Indeed, Inspector Genette interjected.And we appear to be nearing it.They kept descending, dove into another cloud.The ship vibrated tremulously, constantly.Below them lay another thirty thousand kilometers of ever thickening gas before one would hit the black layer of frozen goo, difficult to characterize, which was the planets real surface.It was said ships were hidden down there in the deeper depths, and Wahram had been worried that the one they sought would be down there too.But now there loomed out of a cloud to the south a spaceship, pewter against the blue, hanging under an enormous teardrop balloon.Then, like an apparition, it slipped back into the cloud from which it had emerged.The abandoned ship drifted, swinging this way and that under its balloon.It was quite a bit darker in the cloud, a matter of chocolates briefly turning tangerine or bronze and then darkening again.To express the scene musically Wahram thought one might play Satie and Wagner together, a pin of sadness pricking the magniloquent thunderheads: this little lost ship.They strapped into the cloud divers hopper and it emerged from the dock, shuddering as the little craft fought the turbulence.Out of the mist loomed the dark mass of the silent ship.Wahram could not help thinking of the Marie Celeste, or Paps houseboat on the river.He had to cast aside these old tales to focus on the thing at hand, a typical asteroid trawler by the look of it, with an old fashioned deuterium tritium fusion engine bulbing at its stern.Is this the one you want?Wahram asked.I think so, Inspector Genette said.Your system hit it with a taggart as it went in, and were getting a ping from that taggart.Lets go have a look.They docked with it, their pilot nicely finessing the delicate problem of contact in the fluctuating wind.When they were magnetically moored to it, the three of them and two more of Genettes colleagues suited up and went out, all of them on Ariadne lines.Swan jetted over the ship ahead of the others and touched down next to a lock door just ahead of the rocket bulb.When she hit the door pad, its red light went green, and the door opened.Then there was a flash of light, gone as soon as it flashed; Swan cried out.Genette jetted to her side and floated over her shoulder like her good angel, pulling her back.Wait a minute.I dont like that.And Passepartout tells me that a powerful radio signal has just been sent by the ship.The little inspector jetted into the lock ahead of them, pulling a tool like a pair of bolt cutters from a thigh pocket.Maybe it came from this.There was a box attached to the locks inside door.This is a tack on of some sort.Some kind of little sentinel.May have taken your picture and transmitted it.Lets take it with us.Swan pounded the lock wall next to the device.Here we are!Fuck you!They already know, Genette said, working at the little box as if it were an abalone.But maybe we can turn the tables here.This ship will have a provenance, elements we can trace.Well take its AI with us.The other Interplan investigators opened the inner lock door; the interior appeared to be as much a vacuum as space outside.Wahram followed the others inside.The interior lights were on, the bridge looked functional, and yet no air, no people.Everyone knows a ship has an ID, Wahram said.Why would they hang the ship here?Why wouldnt they just dispose of it?I dont know.Possibly they intended to use it again and didnt know about the Saturnian tracking system.I dont like it.Neither do I.   Maybe this ship is from the unaffiliateds, Swan said.Off record from the start.Are there ships entirely off the grid?Wahram asked.Yes, Genette said briefly, plugging cords from Passepartout into ports on one of the consoles.I have its data, Passepartout said.Lets get out of here, Genette said.Passepartout says the balloons holding this thing up have been punctured.Theyre big, but we need to get out of this thing before it starts falling fast.They rushed through the short halls back to the lock.Their cloud divers pilot was urgently requesting them to get back inside so it could delink; they were dropping into Saturn at an accelerating rate as the giant balloon over them emptied.Quickly they all five jammed into the lock, the inspector and his two assistants taking up only small spaces in the upper corners, looking like spandrels.When the outer door opened, they jetted out into space.The balloon above the abandoned ship was already visibly deflated, thinner and creased and flapping.Nevertheless the Interplan smalls jetted around the hull, inspecting and photographing it by quadrants.See there, Genette said to one of them.Bolt holes.Get samples from the threading.Then they returned to their cloud diver, reeling in on their Ariadne threads.When they were in the lock of the diver, they felt it come away from the abandoned ship and start to rise.They made their way to the bridge, where the pilot was too busy or too polite to comment on the situation.They rose, cutting through clouds overhead, shuddering hard.Were free of it, Genette said irritably to the pilot.Slow down.Wahram for one was happy to be rising at speed.In his youth people had not dived into the planet; it still struck him as an impudent thing, dangerous in the extreme.When they were free of the clouds and back in a clear channel between masses, he relaxed a little.For a time, when they got high enough, they could see north and south to the bands in which the wind coursed in the opposite direction; these both had cloud levels slightly higher than theirs, so for a time it appeared they floated easily down a very broad canal, the banks of which were rushing madly upstream.When they were a bit higher, Inspector Genette showed Swan the screen of his wristqube.Weve got it confirmed.The ship is owned by a transport firm based on Earth.They never reported it missing.Last registered port of call was that asteroid we saw it on.Swan nodded and looked at Wahram.Im going to Earth next, she said.Do you want to come?Wahram said cautiously, I have to go downsystem anyway.So I think I can meet you somewhere down there.Thats good, she said.We can work together there.She seemed not to suspect him of any possibility of harm.Which was niceeven encouragingbut, unfortunately, incorrect.He swallowed heavily.Before you gocan I perhaps show you a bit of Saturn?There is a different kind of flying you might enjoy, in the rings.And I could introduce you to my crche.To my family.She was surprised by this, he could see.He swallowed again, tried to look bland under her sharp gaze.All right, she said.SWAN AND THE RINGS OF SATURN  Inspector Genette and his team had business to conduct in the Saturn system and would not be returning downsystem for a while, so Swan was free to join Wahram as he had requested.His manner had been very odd, his gaze fixed on her, x raying right through hertoad vision, yes.It reminded her of the look he had given her when she told him she had eaten the Enceladan alien suite; out of the fog of that whole incident, the look on his face was what she recalledhis surprise that anyone could be such a fool.Well, he had better get used to it.She was not normal; not even human, but some kind of symbiote.Ever since eating the aliens she had never felt the sameassuming there had ever been any same to begin with.Maybe it had always been true that colors burst in her head, that her sense of spaciousness was sharp to the point of pain or joy, her sense of significance likewise.Possibly the Enceladan bugs made no more difference than any of the other bugs in her gut.She was not sure what she was.The look on Wahrams face seemed to suggest he felt much the same.The visit with Wahrams crche on Iapetus was just a matter of dropping in on one of the ordinary meals in their communal kitchen.These are some of my friends and family, Wahram said when introducing Swan to the small group at a long table.Swan nodded as they chorused hello, and then Wahram walked her around the room and introduced her to people.This is my wife Joyce; this is Robin.This is my husband Dana.Dana nodded once, in a way that reminded Swan of Wahram, and said, Wahram is funny.I seem to recall that I was the wife when it came to us.Oh no, Wahram said.I was the wife, I assure you.Dana smiled with a little squint of suppressed disagreement.Maybe we both were.It was a long time ago.In any case, Miss Swan, welcome to Iapetus.Were happy to be hosting such a famous designer.I hope youve enjoyed Saturn so far?Yes, its been interesting, Swan said.And now Wahram is going to take me down into the rings.She followed them to the central dining table, and Wahram introduced her to some more people, whose names she forgot, and they waved or nodded without attempting to say more.After a while they chatted with her a bit, then went back to their conversations and left Wahram and his guest alone.Wahrams cheeks sported little spots of red, but he seemed pleased too and was easy with his crchemates as they drifted by on their way out.Maybe on Saturn, Swan thought, this was a rousing party.Soon after that they took a shuttle to Prometheus, the inner shepherd moon of the F ring.The gravitational sweeps of Prometheus and Pandora, Fs outer shepherd moon, changed in relation to each other in ways that ended up braiding the F rings billions of ice chunks into complex streamers, very unlike the smooth sheets of the bigger rings.In effect the F ring was being swirled in the tides created by its two shepherd moons, making for some waves.And where there were waves, there were surfers.Prometheus proved to be a potato moon, 120 kilometers long.Its biggest crater dimpled the end closest to the F ring and had been domed, and a station set just inside the rim.Inside the dome a group of ring surfers greeted them and described the local wave, of which they were very proud.Prometheus reached its apoapse, meaning its farthest point away from Saturn, every 14.7 hours; each time it did so, it almost brushed the slowly tumbling wall of ice chunks that composed the inner border of the F ring.Prometheus was moving faster in its orbit than the ice chunks were in theirs, so it tugged a streamer of chunks out behind it as it passed, in a gravitational effect called Keplerian shear.The curving strand of tugged ice always appeared at a regular distance behind Prometheus, as predictable as the wake behind a boat.The wave at each apoapse appeared 3.2 degrees farther along than the previous one, so it was possible to calculate both when and where to drop in and catch it.One wave every fifteen hours?Swan asked.That was enough, the locals assured her, grinning crazily.She wouldnt need more.The rides went on for hours.Hours?Swan said.More crazy grins.Swan turned to Wahram, and as usual could not read his stone face.Youre going out too?she asked.Yes.Have you done it before?No.She laughed.Good.Lets do it.The rings could be modeled mathematically as a fluid, and from any distance they looked like a fluid, grooved by tight concentric waves.Up close one could see that the F ring, like the others, was made of ice chunks and ice dust, layered in ribbons that thickened and thinned in masses of individual bodies, all flying at almost the same speed.Gravity: here one saw its effects in a pure state, unobstructed by wind or solar radiation or anything elsejust the sling of spinning Saturn and a few small competing tugs, all creating this particular pattern.Prometheus was a perfect put in spot for the surfers, and the ones going out with Swan and Wahram informed them they were both going to be launched into the wave with experienced veterans going before and after, to keep tabs and give help if needed.They offered tips for how to catch the wave, but Swan nodded agreeably and forgot their advice: surfing was surfing.You needed to catch the break at its own particular speed, and off you went.Then they were all suited up and jetting out a lock.The white jumbled wall of the F ring was right there next to them; streamers of denser clusters of rubble were braided and kinked, but the entire mass was extremely flatno more than about ten meters north to south relative to Saturn.Those ten meters were not the height of their wave but its widthwhich meant one could pop out of the ice at any point and be spotted and picked up if one was having any kind of trouble.Most of the waves Swan had ridden before were not like that, and she found it reassuring.They jetted closer and closer to the white wall, until Swan could see discrete ice chunks very clearly, ranging in size from sand grains to suitcases, with the occasional chunk of ice furnituredesk, coffintumbling in the midst of things.Once she saw a temporary agglomeration about the size of a small house, but it was coming apart even as she spotted it.And now a white curl of banner was detaching from the wall and flowing down toward Saturn, which though bulking hugely below them was of no interest at all.Swan tested her jets as she flew toward the wave, pressing with fingertips like a clarinet player, jinking forward in a little sashay of her own device.Suit jets were about the same everywhere.She focused on the approaching wave, which was lifting up and over her like Hiroshiges wave; this one was ten kilometers high, and rising fast.She needed to turn and accelerate in the direction it was going, but not so quickly that she stayed ahead of it.This was the tricky part  Then she was in the white stuff and being struck by the bits.She jetted a bit to keep her head out of stuff, as if bodysurfing out of a spume of broken salt water, but it was chunky stuff and she felt herself being thrust forward by little hits from little bits, rather than a mass of water.Then she was at speed with the wave, her head emerging from it so she could look aroundvery like bodysurfing, and she had to laugh, she had to shout: she was flying in a wave of ice ten kilometers high.She hooted at the sight, she couldnt help it.The common band was raucous with the other surfers yelling.The wave was really more a slice of a wave, only as wide as a room, and it sometimes felt only a bit thicker than she wasa two dimensional wave, so to speak, so that it seemed one could get hit sideways, or jet at a slight tangent, and accidentally shoot out the side of it.So it would not do to submerge completely back into the white stuff, dolphin style.Maybe some of the other riders were doing it, but she felt she could get lost in there.Besides, she wanted to see!She could feel the wave lifting her and casting her along.It was not only being struck by ice chunks, but also being tugged by gravity.The feel of the ice was like getting lightly pummeled by pebbles, which together were knocking her forward.Possibly one could ride a big surfboard on the push of this mass, direct the ride with ones feet; indeed she saw down the wave someone standing on a thing like a coracle, riding in that very manner.But most of the others were bodysurfing like she was, perhaps because you needed a suits jets to make the best moves.In any case she had always preferred bodysurfing to surfing on boards.To be the object of flight, to cast yourself out into the spaces you breathed, and although motionless be flying at speed, slung forward  The wave pitched and she was knocked forward faster than ever.Most of the chunks were between tennis balls and basketballs in size, and if she emerged on her jets until only her feet were in the mass, she could hop on bigger chunks and propel herself with little jumps forward and out.The wave was still surging up, but it was like the wake of a boat, in that there was no bottom to catch the submerged half of the wave and cause the upper part to curl and break.So from now on it would lose energy, and eventually dissipate without ever breaking.Too bad in a way, but now it was time to dance!She jumped onto larger pieces when opportunities presented themselves, and with one jump after another got just where she wanted to be, on the border between the white flock of ice and the empty black space it was rushing into; and then she was dancing on white boulders, glissading on a kind of moving scree, as if running down a mountainside that had gone liquid.She laughed briefly as she got the hang of it.There was still a lot of hooting and hollering on the common band.The figure nearest her was possibly Wahram, hopping along with remarkable agility, like the dancing hippos in Fantasia.She laughed to see it.She could feel Prometheus tugging her along; this must be what a pelican felt like, surfing the air pushed up by a water wave.A gravity wave, throwing her through the universe.The howls of the other surfers sounded like wolves.Back under the dome on Prometheus, out of their suits, Swan gave Wahram a sweaty hug.Thank you for that!she said.I needed that!It reminded me that it reminded me Well.It was good.Wahram was red faced, puffing with exertion.He nodded once, his mouth pursed in a solemn little knot.Well what did you think?she cried.Did you enjoy it?It was interesting, he said.Lists (9)  Boosters to get off planets, Earth especially, need high thrust  Orbit to orbit

Lakshmi herself.When he explained how he had gotten the number, she gave him directions to a noodle house near him and told him she would be there in an hour, and she was.She turned out to be a Venusian native in the classic moldtall, dark, handsome, taciturn.Her combination of Chinese ancestry and Indian name resembled that of some others he had met; he had been given to understand it marked Venusians who wanted some separation from the old country, with the name being a way of saying they were more Venusian than Chinese.Dont stop working for Shukra, Lakshmi told him immediately, even though Shukra had left him in a state of xuanfu (drifting chaos).She would help him to get to cuo suo.(Both meant place, Kirans translation belt told him, but suo was ones own place, meaning also his work unit. )She would give him a better assignment, which would involve serving as a courier in his travels, moving things and information from one xiaojinku to another.Xiaojinku, small gold storage centers: this sounded good to Kiran.He agreed to do it.Only then did Lakshmi tell him that he would be paid in yinxing gongzi, invisible wages.That didnt sound as good, but something in the way she said it made him think it would be all right.At the end of her description of his new job, Lakshmi stared at him.Shukra got you from Swan Er Hong, but he did not use you.Does he think you are stupid?Or maybe Swan?Or me?Kiran almost said, Maybe Shukra is the stupid one, but Lakshmi did not actually seem to expect him to reply.She got up and left, and an hour later he had a new ID number, thus a whole new identity and name.None of which seemed to matter to anyone.His first assignment from Lakshmi was to courier a small packet from Cleopatra back to Colette; he was to fly back, to get there faster.With the packet, Lakshmi gave him a pair of translating glasses, which looked like thick old fashioned black spectacles, with speakers in the earpieces.Better translator, she explained.So he booked a flight, and in the process found that his new identity had quite a number of creditsso many it was a little scary.But interesting too, to see what kind of resources Lakshmi commanded.Maybe a whole xiaojinku, or more than one.People in his old work unit had said she was in the Working Group, and the Working Group ruled the planet.Certainly her translator glasses were an upgrade; when he looked at Chinese language signs, with all their intricate ideograms, he now saw them overlaid in glowing red with the words rendered in English.It was startling to discover just how much information was written into the cityscape, now in glowing red: Beware of the Three Withouts.Vote for Stormy Chang.Towering Mountain Beer.The Door in the Middle of Half the Sky Alterations.A gender clinic, apparently.One could also Give Father a Second Sister.Then he was off on a plane, then up above the turbulent clouds, into the permanent night under Venuss sunshield.Only starlight illuminated the cloudtops below.Being in a jet reminded him of Earth.Out the window Earth itself made for a bluish double star overhead, with Earth twice as bright as Luna, the two together jewel like and a little bit heart stopping.Then the clouds below cleared, and he could see broken chopped jumbled ridgesthe Maxwell Montes, apparently.They formed a giant mountain range, Venuss Himalayas.In Colette he gave Lakshmis packet to a person who approached him at his lodge entrance, and two days later the same person came by and asked him to take another packet to Cleopatra, on another flight.Back in Cleopatra Kiran went up to the promenade running around the crater circumference just inside the dome, as instructed.Snow flowed down the outside of the dome in a perpetual avalanche.The packet was to be taken to point 328 on the dial of 360 degrees that divided the rim promenade.He found that the rail on the promenade was numbered as if in an arena concourse.The person waiting for him at 328, a small of indeterminate gender, spoke in Chinese.We are the night runners of Bengal, very important work, Kirans glasses translated out loud, causing a smile from the speaker, who apparently understood English; the glasses must have said something funny, but Kiran didnt know what it was.Tell me more about that, he said quickly, and the small led him to a nearby bar.Kexue (Science) sat on the bars edge while Kiran sat on a stool, and for a couple of hours Kiran listened to stories muttered in his ear by his glasses, stories that made little sense to him but were interesting anyway.They were part of a project, Lakshmi was a goddess, Science had once kissed her foot and almost electrocuted humble self; one could not touch the gods, but only obey.When they parted, Kiran got Kexues number and a promise to get together again.His run back to Colette, with another packet, was to be on the ground this time, in a dedicated rover.He found he was only honorary pilot at best of this squat rover with six wheels, as it ran by AI.It was pretty fast, humming over a road of crushed rock and hard packed gravel and passing enormous mining trucks with deft lane changes.The cab of the rover tilted backward, it seemed from the weight in the freight compartment behind.The freight had not been identified for him, but there was a dosimeter clicking steadily away on the dash.Uranium, maybe?The packet Kexue had given him was not sealed, and he checked in it, hoping this action would not be detectable, and saw that he was carrying a number of handwritten notes.Their Chinese letters scrawled like drunken calligraphy and were surrounded by little sketch drawings of birds and animals.His glasses overlaid the letters with red words:  Only he who has eyes can see.In great attempts it is glorious even to fail.Seemed like codes to him.Whether the messages were personal or official, important or routine, he could not know.At one point his glasses had translated Kexue as saying that to circumvent both Shukra and the qubes, Lakshmi was being forced to keep to just a word in the ear.Maybe these notes were part of that.Things were very, very unclear at the top, Kexue had said.Like in China?Kiran had asked.No, Kexue had said.Not like China.Back in Colette, Kiran gave the packet to the same person outside his lodge door, then rejoined his work unit and spent a few weeks back on the ice, then got another call from Lakshmi and went to Cleopatra to get another packet.That happened quite a few times, with nothing in particular to distinguish each instance.As Kiran continued to live with his work unit in Colette and perform work associated with Shukra, he supposed he might have accidentally become some kind of mole or double agent, but he couldnt be sure.He would have to call on Swan for his defense if anyone got annoyed.One day he found out by accident, when pushing his translation glasses back up on his nose, that they would translate with the red words floating on the lenses from spoken Chinese as well as written ideograms.This was a great discovery, and helped him both to learn faster and to stay in the game while he did learn.Red writing plastered over the visible worldit could be disconcerting, but it was so nice to have things explained at last.He kept it on more than off.So, message packets and the occasional radioactive rover were couriered by him back and forth over the Spine of Ishtar.Looking at the map, Kiran saw that the giant high plateau that dominated the western half of Ishtar (and would that be the Shoulders of Ishtar or the Butt of Ishtar?)was named Lakshmi Planum.He didnt know if this was a coincidence or an allusion.He had to wear a personal dosimeter, and the millisieverts clicked on up.It was lucky that the longevity treatments had good mutation repair therapies!He made many drives alone, and the AIs on board the squat rovers were simple indeed.The translator glasses were turning out to be much like a dog, attentive but predictable.He had never liked dogs, but in the struggle to understand his situation, he had to like this one.In Cleopatra, after his meetings with Kexue, he would go out in search of the loudest bars he could find.Down one alley he heard English being sung, an entire group singing The Ballad of John Reed, and he almost ran down the street to make sure they would not somehow disappear.But it turned out to be just a song bar, with lots of bad beer and bad jokes and only a few people who spoke English.He met a woman there nevertheless, Zaofan (Rise in Rebellion), and went with her back to her room, and when they resurfaced from their dive into sex, back to the world of speech, and began to talk in the darkness before the city domes artificial dawn, she mentioned that she too worked for Lakshmi.Kiran felt a quick pulse of fearit seemed more than a coincidence.He asked her some questions, very cautiously, and after a while her stories made it seem like half the people in Cleopatra worked for Lakshmi, so possibly their meeting had been a coincidence after all.Which would be nice; he didnt want to be involved in any plots he didnt understand.On the other hand, he did want to be involved in plots that he did understand.That would represent progress.So he began to hang out at the song bar, and between his spectacles and the people there who spoke some English, and once or twice some Telugu, he talked to a lot of people.He would sit between a Uighur and a Vietnamese and they would be using English to communicate with each other, their English mangled to the point of poetry, but comprehensible.He would bless the British and American empires and soak in every phrase.He stuck by his friend Zaofan when he could find her, and from her and her unit found out more about Lakshmi.Lakshmi was one of the Working Group, everyone agreed.She didnt like Shukra; she didnt like China.In fact no one knew of anything she liked.There were rumors that in Indian mythology, Lakshmi was an avatar of Kali the death goddessor maybe it was vice versano one knew for sure.Their Lakshmi was said to be hermaphroditic, and went through lovers like a black widow.You did not want to have her attention fixed on you.She had lived all over Venus in her youth, and some said ran a Beijing protection racket during her sabbaticals, under the nom de guerre Zhandhou (Do Battle).Shukra was in big troubleHell be sanwu before its all over, youll see.Or maybe even four withouts, if she castrates him too!Apparently Lakshmi had wanted to eject Venuss frozen carbon dioxide at an angle into space, a process that over time would have speeded up Venuss rotation and made for a natural day.That plan had been turned down in favor of the big sequestration, but as she was such a power in the Working Group, there was always the possibility that the policy might someday change.Who knew?The Working Group was a tight secretive little club, prone to fits of enthusiasm and sudden faction.Most of the people in the song bar felt it was a dangerous force, not at all interested in ordinary Venusians except insofar as they were useful to the terraforming.In other words, same old China!China 2.0!Chinaworld!The Middle Kingdom Relocated Closer to Sun!Therefore the Inner Kingdom!They had a lot of names for it.Some in the bar said all this was an exaggeration and a clich.Here they were in the song bar, after all, and out there doing great things every day, therefore part of the story of Venus, no matter what people said about governmentbut much laughter and shouted scorn greeted these sentiments.Obviously most in the bar felt they were only helpless observers of a giant drama going on above their heads, a drama that was eventually going to suck them down into its maelstrom, no matter what they said or wanted.Better therefore to drink and talk and sing and dance until they were stupid with exhaustion and ready for a stagger through the early morning streets, Kiran following Zaofan to her slot on the matrazenlager of her work unit.After a few repetitions of this Kiran was accepted as part of her work units lodge, which was nice.One time he was coming back into Colette when it seemed to him that someone was watching him, and when he noticed this, the person began to close on him.A big man, and his quick glance revealed to Kiran the existence of another person behind Kiran.Immediately Kiran bolted into one of the jammed alleyways and jinked through the back of an open front shop, causing an uproar that he hoped would delay the people following him.After that it was a matter of dashing as hard as he could, deeper and deeper into the maze of circular alleys that made up Colettes downtown.Zigzagging often, he hurried to Lakshmis little Colette office and drew himself up before the security person at the front desk with aplomb.Here to see Lakshmi, he huffed.The security persons eyebrows shot up his forehead and instantly there was a gun pointing at Kirans face.It took a while for Lakshmi to get over to Colette, and in that time the guards didnt want him to leave the office.It was pretty much like being under arrest, but when Lakshmi arrived, she seemed pleased with his escape.Theres a closed building under the rim at 123 in Cleopatra, she said when he was done with his story.Move to Cleopatra, stay with your friend there, and just float for a while.See if you can figure out how many people go in and out of that building per day.I think Shukras trying to set up a xiaojinku in my town.Does that work like a hawala?Kiran asked.Lakshmi did not acknowledge that he had spoken.She left and then Kiran was free to go.So the next time he was in Cleopatra, Kiran floated.He went across the city into the 110 district, where the radial boulevards were less frequent and the buildings often industrial in size and purpose.The bars were correspondingly bigger as well.He went into one near the 123 facility and sat near the slot where the bartender gave drinks to the waiters.He turned on his translation glasses and stared forward like he was watching something on them, slurping bad beer and reading the translation of the voices around him.Theyre too beautiful, its a mistake.Lakshmi wanted them that way.Shhh!She who must not be named!But Kiran could hear them laughing.The glasses did not print out in red Ha Ha Ha!as in a comic book; he wished they would.After an evening of listening to bar patrons he stood around for a while in the street, took a cable car up to the rim promenade, and walked above the neighborhood in question, looking down casually.He had his spectacles record the conversations going on around him.Later that night, back down near the city center, he sat in a corner table of a bar and played verbal translations of what he had recorded, hoping he had caught some security people talking.She has to stop this, its too much.But another one was not happy to hear this: We work for Big Pears, just do it.Kiran kept replaying the spectacles recordings and translations, trying to get the hang of the Chinese tones as well as ponder the sense of the scraps of talk.There was a man from Shanghai, it seemed.Nnrn husheng.This seemed to be a man of importance.Shanghai was inundated, he thought.Maybe it was another code phrase.There was a song in the song bar: My home was in Shanghainow its underwaterI came to Venus because I did not want to live with the fishesbut now here I am, and its wetter than the bottom of the seaand full of sharks!Goodness gracious!The word they, tamen, seemed to refer to the Working Group, or some other powerful force behind the scenes.They want this, they will do that.The Working Group was definitely opaque from below.It was either elected or appointed; no one knew which.There were supposedly about fifty people in it.Some people said it was like the tongs back home, others that they had found their method in the pre Han ways, or even from the lost Iroquois League of North America.Zaofan and her unit were full of more stories, told in snatches when out in the streets.Lakshmi was working with others, including Vishnu (naturally), also a Rama and a Krishna.Taking an Indian name was compared to cutting off your queue during the Qing dynasty.So if the people doing this were in the Working Group, what did that say about Venus China relations?No one was quite sure.Vishnu and Rama appeared only at meetings held at the Cleopatra spaceport, so possibly they came from off planet or were traveling a lot.Krishna lived on Venus, but in Nabuzana, a canyon city on Aphrodite.Once Kiran was called into Lakshmis room when Krishna was visiting her, or so Zaofan told him later when he described the visitor, who had not been introduced or said a word.Shukras new building at Cleopatra 123 (if that was what it was) was tightly secured, with a small population living in it full time, judging by food shipments in and recycling shipments out.Kiran spent a fair amount of time in the neighborhood, wandering around watching the place, sometimes from the rim promenade.Lakshmis people also had several closed buildings in Cleopatra, Kiran was learning, so perhaps she felt that Shukra was horning in on her territory by doing the same.Then one day he went back to Zaofans lodge in Cleopatra and found their section of the matrazenlager was occupied by an entirely different group of people.Zaofan was gone, Strength of Nation, Great Leapall the little group that had taken him in.The lodge manager said they had left together after getting a call from somewhere on Aphrodite.The manager shrugged.This was the way on Venus, the shrug said.People got their working orders and moved as a unit.If you werent part of the unit, it wasnt any of your affair; you were xuan, left hanging.No!Kiran cried aloud.Zaofan!He had laughed with these people, he had said their names in English and they would laugh!The new crowd on the matrazenlager turned their backs to him until he was ready to talk.After that they introduced themselves, and as he could tell them where the good bars in the neighborhood were and things like that, they folded him into their crowd in much the same way the earlier one had.Still he felt changed, and was reserved with these people as he had not been with the first groupor really they had been the second, now that he thought about it.It was going to keep happening, he could see.You could only give yourself so many times.The lodge manager, with whom he had become friendly, saw that in him.Dont think that way or you cut yourself off!You can give yourself as many times as there are chances to give.Its not something that runs out.It hurts too much when people go.The manager shrugged.Attachment is fruitless.Release and move on.Your cuo is your suo.Your place is your place.A lodge keepers philosophy.But every building on Venus was a lodge.Or every building in the solar system.Meanwhile this new group had some people in it who also worked for Lakshmi, down at the new seacoast being built in the south.They were building cities in advance of the ocean, which was still falling every day as snow.Sea level was going to be a high stakes game for years to come, with any number of players involved.There was even a futures market of sorts devoted to it, in that you could place bets on the height sea level would ultimately attain.The range being bet on was apparently pretty wideover two vertical kilometers, which horizontally meant huge stretches of land.Deals in the Working Group or even back in China were apparently being made, broken, remade; new directives followed one after another.Great masses of dry ice that were still not sequestered were being shoved around; then abruptly the shoving would stop, leaving dikes like contour lines on a map, curving all over the dim white landscape.This stuff had to get buried before temperatures rose any higher, or else it would evaporate back into the atmosphere and poison them all.Terraforming, they said, was becoming a murderous business.All this was news to Kiran, and the next time he saw Lakshmi he told her about his new lodge team, and asked if he could join them the next time they made a trip down to the coast.She shook her head at first, then frowned, then agreed to it.Just go down there and see the town, learn the layout.Ill let you know if I want you to courier anything there.So he joined his new team for a rover trip down to Vinmara.On the way down the enormous south slope of Ishtar, they passed another new town that was being built with a harbor on its empty downhill side; then they drove down some giant hairpin turns and descended at least another thousand meters, maybe two, before coming to Vinmara, also being built as a harbor town.This struck Kiran as indicating a pretty serious dispute over the future sea level, but his new team scoffed at the town they had passed as a futile statement, one that would have to install a swimming pool to front its harbor when the time came.Vinmara itself was being more grown than built, it looked like, as it was made mostly of bioceramics, scalloping in rounded stacks around a waterfront.The seaside promenade or corniche would anchor an urban district, ringing the bay of the ocean that would someday be there.Above and behind the waterfront curve the city rose steeply to a backing ridge, already being covered with seashell shapes mostly white or beige, then trimmed with pastel blue in the Greek style.This is Lakshmis work, this town?Yes, it was a project of her part of the Working Group.And someone else is building that harbor town back up the slope?Yes, that was Shukras peoples town.They were fools and idiots.But dont they know how high the ocean will go?Kiran asked.I mean, the waters already up there in the atmosphere, right?Gesturing briefly at their eternal blizzard.Why wouldnt the models get it right?His teammates shrugged.One or two were giving each other looks that indicated to Kiran that this question needed to be added to his Unsolved Mysteries of the Solar System file.It was a big file.One of the mates finally said, There are choices to be made.Some basins flooded or not flooded.They took him to a sidewalk caf backing the new seawall, overlooking another little marina standing over black rock.Each round table of the caf had its own umbrella, despite the bigger umbrella of the tent over the whole town.They were almost the only ones there, at first; then others began to trickle in, and a trio of guitarists set up and began to play, after which people started dancing.Party in a dry marina, in a night dark storm by an empty sea.The heat lamps were on, and if you danced long enough, you could even warm your feet up.Kiran kept dancing with someone from his new unit, a young womanyes, the old male female magnetism still the most reliable guide to sex, as far as Kiran was concerned; and he could see variants of that being acted out all over the dance floor.Actually it was often hard to tell who was what, and this gal in fact was half a meter taller than he was, and pretty masculine and assertive at that, and in response Kiran was ready to melt like a girl who wants to get pregnant that very night.Whatever!He liked looking up at her face!He tried talking.Lynh?Shengren syingyu?Union?Stranger sexual desire?Syin pengyu syingyu, she said, mocking him.New friend sexual desire, his spectacles wrote on the world in red.Even better!Tyauwu, she ordered him.Dance.Extracts (10)  Take some carbon dioxide, ammonia, formaldehyde, hydrocyanic acid, and salt.Put them in water and heat.Reduce to hot goo at the bottom of the pan; add more salt water.Repeat until you have a thick broth containing amino acids, sugars, and fatty acids.Throw in seasoning to taste.Each reduction and rehydration will thicken the broth further, until it includes many newly created nitroglycopeptides, and they will begin to form the protopolymers you need.Some of the fatty acids will have hydrophobic tails and will tend therefore to stick together aligned with each other.These masses are your protomembranes, which in the heat of your stove top will wrap into tubes, also spheres with holes in them.Inside these little tart shells, a stuffing of protopolymers will clump together in a variety of macromolecules.These begin the chemical breaking and joining we call catalysis.Chemical patterns in your new stuffing will yield similar combinations most of the time, and these new combinations will match up chemically in ways that can be read off each other; so information is now burbling around in your stuffing, and into and out of the hole in the cell wall will come useful molecules for more reactions.Linking up with patterned molecules already inside, these characteristic actions are coded by the basic chemistry, so they will keep occurring.What began as small accidental connections will link together in patterned ways, until the same polymers are always replicated, creating information contained in the longest chains to have been cooked up.At that point you have ribonucleic acid, RNA, and you are close to being ready.The new RNA encodes the making of proteins, which in their three dimensional sculptural glory are capable of creating a huge variety of tastes and smells.Division of labor in the proteins and what they accomplish is one way to describe the proliferation of replicating forms, but also, its a richer brew; it tastes better; there are micro tastes within the taste.Your RNA will turn amino acids into particular flavors.(The technical term among biologists is translation. )Finally some of your RNA will melt together into strands of DNA, a more stable form because of its double helix.Then DNA will take over the role of protein expression, although by way of the creation of messenger RNA.(That would be transcription. )Information at that point will move from DNA to RNA to proteins, and the now living cell will reproduce itself, divide up functions in ever more versatile larger organisms, and so on.You have cooked up life from scratch!Eat it with gusto.Quantum Walk (1)  a street out in a street move naturally be alert dont make eye contact that will be hard  hope is the thing with feathers buildings massed to

matter.Sometimes the passion would be so intense that when the trip ended Swan couldnt remember who she was or why she was getting off, or what she had been going to do at that destination.Had to start up a new self from scratch.This terrarium she was in now, with Genette, whose presence would definitely keep her oriented to her task, was an old flame, the Bantian Kongzhong Yizou Men, meaning The Door in the Middle of Half the Empty Sky, which was one of the many Chinese euphemisms for the vulva.It was a place she had helped get started back when she had been young and passionate to grow worlds.Now it was a sexliner of a rather nontheatrical naturalistic sort.There were big hot pools set just above and behind a long beach, which was bisected where the river met the sea.All these places were the site of a lot of public and semiprivate copulation.Swan spent most of her days out riding waves in the small sea.Immersion in the murmur of surf, water in her mouth.In her nose the salt air, which was quick to put a curl in her hair.Waves and tides stimulated marshes to grow, so there were changes in the speed of rotation to create a tidal slosh in here, and far out in the cylindrical sea a point break made some sweet waves.The point break had been her idea, but since then they had extended it with a spiraling reef that continued the break around the whole cylinder, when the waves were right.Having made it all the way around the cylinder, one could then paddle a short distance sternward to the original break again, a very nice touch.But she found herself too distracted to surf with real pleasure, and after the wild ride in the F ring, it felt a little mundane.She rode a wave entirely around the cylinder, paddled sternward to catch anotherone of the neatest arrangements she had ever seenand yet it only felt like being stuck in an Escher drawing.So she would quit and paddle in.When she came in through the splashing lovers grunioning in the shallows, it was always to find Inspector Genette staring at Passepartout or consulting with the other Interplan investigators, also by radio with others scattered everywhere across the great whirligig.She saw how much of their work involved finding databases and sifting through them, trying to formulate questions that their data might hold answers to.Their work was as invisible as the computations that kept all the spaceships and terraria on course in their woven trajectories, with all their Aldrin cycles and Homan paths and gravity lanes defined like threads on a vast circular spiraling loom.Data analysis, pattern recognition; a big part of the work was done by their qubes and AIs.The rest was accomplished by a bunch of people behaving as Genette was now, sitting there as she approached from the beach, mycrofting spiderlike in a raised chair that looked weirdly like a toddlers high chair at a restaurant.Several of them were there working together, by the terrace railing overlooking one of the sex pools.Swan joined them and tried to attend to what they were doing, tried to keep track of what was being investigated and how.There was a certain pleasure in hearing that they had found some leads concerning the ship floating in the clouds of Saturn, and had even identified the little transponder that had gone off when they entered its lock.There was a holding company on Earth that both held title to the ship and had ordered the batch of transponders that theirs had come from.But ultimately that meant only that there were more lines of pursuit to follow, on Earth and elsewhere.And the pursuit was going to continue to look like this, with qubes employing search algorithms to making quantum walks through the decoherent and incoherent traces of the past.She didnt see how she could help with that.It was getting to be time to go home.Then the lion cubs in Terminator asked her to make arrangements for the restocking of the rebuilt Terminators park and farm.That was something Swan could definitely help with.Im going to get back to work for Terminator, she said to Genette.Ill stay in touch, of course, but I need to go to Earth and arrange for inoculants.Were headed there already, Genette said.Looks like it may be the source of our problem.During this passage she often met with the inspector for a last drink at the end of the evening, when the dining terrace had otherwise emptied and many people were down below in the dimly lit pools, swimming about and coupling in the shallows.Swan sat with her forearms on the railing, chin on the back of her hand, looking down at them listlessly.The inspector would climb up and sit on the rail beside her, still sometimes reading Passepartouts screen.Sometimes they talked about the case, and Swan was struck by questions Genette threw out along the way:  If you knew there was a mad person helping you get what you wanted, would you stop them?If a person was mistreated to the point where they acted like an algorithm, did they still count as human?These were troubling questions.And all the while they looked down at the undeniably mammalian figures in the baths, wavering in the blue underwater lightscouples and small groups, a lot of laughter, low murmurs, occasional rhythmic primate cries.Coupling or tripling, or balling into intertwined panmixia.A lot of them would be on oxytocin and having supremely affectionate experiences; others would have taken entheogenic compounds and be off in mystical tantric transports.Right now under them on the wet poolside a number of smalls were attending to an extremely tall tall, so that it looked like Gulliver in a Lilliputian brothel, creepy and heartwarming in rapid oscillation.Swan herself had served as Snow White to some dwarves in her time, and now she glanced to see if the inspector was watching them, wondering if any reaction would be visible.But Genette appeared to be looking elsewhere, at two flagrant bisexuals, both with big breasts and tall erections, and also very pregnant, lying on their sides, rolling from one sexual position to another.They look like walruses, Swan said.The pregnancy is just too much.Its not transgressive, its a travesty.Genette shrugged.Pornography, right?They want it to look strange.Well, theyve succeeded.Swan laughed.I think they want it to be transgressive, but they havent quite managed.Sex as public performance?Isnt that transgressive where you come from?But this is a sexliner.People come here to do this.The inspector looked at her, head tilted to the side.Maybe its just theater.But bad theater, thats what Im saying.Just showing off, then.We all do it.We live in ideas.That can be a real problem, as I have said.But not here.Genette blessed the scene with an outstretched hand.This is just sweet.Im going to go down myself in a while and join them.The Bantian Kongzhong Yizou Men was going to use Mars as a gravity handle to shoot cross system to Earth, so Swan joined those who went out to the observation bubble to have a look as they flashed over it.She asked the inspector about going along, but got only a mimes scowl in return.What?she said.Whats wrong with Mars?I grew up there, Genette said, standing erect, shoulders back.I went to school there, I worked there for forty years.But they exiled me for a crime I didnt commit, and since they have exiled me, I exile them.I shit on Mars!Oh, Swan said.I didnt know.What was the crime?The inspector waved her away.Go.Go look at the big red bastard before you miss it.So she went by herself up to the bubble chamber in the bowsprit.The Bantian Kongzhong Yizou Men shot by Mars right above its atmosphere, avoiding any aerobraking while maximizing the gravity sling.For a matter of ten minutes or so they were right over itthe red land, the long green lines of the canals, the canyons running down to the northern sea, the great volcanoes sticking right up out of the atmospherethen it was behind them, shrinking like a pebble dropped from a balloon.I hear its an interesting place, someone said.EARTH, THE PLANET OF SADNESS  When you look at the planet from low orbit, the impact of the Himalayas on Earths climate seems obvious.It creates the rain shadow to beat all rain shadows, standing athwart the latitude of the trade winds and squeezing all the rain out of them before they head southwest, thus supplying eight of the Earths mightiest rivers, but also parching not only the Gobi to the immediate north, but also everything to the southwest, including Pakistan and Iran, Mesopotamia, Saudi Arabia, even North Africa and southern Europe.The dry belt runs more than halfway across the Eurasia African landmassa burnt rock landscape, home to the fiery religions that then spread out and torched the rest of the world.Coincidence?In North Africa the pattern is now disrupted by many big shallow lakes dotting the Sahara and the Sahel.The water has been pumped out of the Mediterranean and deposited in depressions in the desert, often in ancient lake beds.Some of these are as big as the Great Lakes, though much shallower.Theyre freshwater lakes; the water from the Med has been progressively desalinated on its way inland, and the recovered salts have been bonded with fixatives to make excellent white bricks and roof tiles.White roof tiles covered by translucent photovoltaic film have been used for all new construction since the Accelerando, and retrofitted onto many older roofs as well; these days when seen from space, cities look like patches of snow.But clean tech came too late to save Earth from the catastrophes of the early Anthropocene.It was one of the ironies of their time that they could radically change the surfaces of the other planets, but not Earth.The methods they employed in space were almost all too crude and violent.Only with the utmost caution could they tinker with anything on Earth, because everything there was so tightly balanced and interwoven.Anything done for good somewhere usually caused ill somewhere else.This caution about terraforming Earth expressed itself in clots and gouts of sometimes military bickering.Political crosschop led to legal gridlock.Big geoengineering projects were all assumed to contain within them an accident like the Little Ice Age of the 2140s, which was generally said to have caused the death of a billion people.Nothing now could overcome that fear.Also, for many of Earths problems, there was simply nothing to be done.The heating and subsequent expansion of the oceans wateralso its acidificationnothing could be done about these.There was no terraforming technique that would help.Some water had been pumped onto the dry basins of North Africa and central Asia, but the capacity was not there to hold very much of the oceans excess volume.Maintaining the one healthy ice cap remaining to them, high on East Antarctica, was a priority that meant no one was comfortable pumping salt water up there to freeze, as had sometimes been proposed, because if something went wrong and they lost the whole ice cap, it would raise sea level another fifty meters and deal humanity something very like a death blow.So caution was in order, and ultimately it had to be admitted: the new sea level could not be substantially altered.And it was much the same with many of their other problems.The many delicate physical, biological, and legal situations were so tightly knitted together that none of the cosmic engineering they were doing elsewhere in the solar system could be fitted to the needs of the place.Despite this, people tried things.So much more power than ever before was at their command that some felt they could at last begin to overturn Jevons Paradox, which states that the better human technology gets, the more harm we do with it.That painful paradox has never yet failed to manifest itself in human history, but perhaps now was the tipping pointArchimedes lever brought to bear at lastthe moment when they could get something out of their growing powers besides redoubled destruction.But no one could be sure.They still hung suspended between catastrophe and paradise, spinning bluely in space like some terrible telenovela.Scheherazade was Earths muse, it seemed; it was just one damn thing after another, always one more cliffhanger, clinging to life and sanity by the skin of ones teeth; and so the spacers kept on coming home, home to homes nightmares, with the Gordian knot tied right in their guts.SWAN ON EARTH  Earth exerted a fatal attraction far beyond its heavy g, having to do more with its nearly infinite historical gravity, its splendor and decadence and dirt.You didnt have to go to Uttar Pradesh and view the melting ruins of Agra or Benares to see itit was fractal and everywhere, in every valley and village: decrepit age, the stink of cruel societies, bare eroded hillsides, drowned coastlines still melting into the sea.A very disturbing place.The strangeness was not always obvious or tangible.Human time here was simply wrenched; the center had not held; things fell apart and recombined to create feelings that did not cohere inside one.Ideas of order became hopelessly bogged in ancient stories, webs of law, faces on the street.Best to focus on the day in hand, as always.Therefore Swan launched out of one of the mid African elevator cars in a glider at some fifty thousand meters, and flew down toward a landing strip in the Sahel, in what should have been the bare waste of the south marching Sahara, a desert without the slightest sign of life on it, not unlike brightside on Mercuryexcept there below her, brilliant white blocky towns rimmed the edges of shallow green or sky blue lakes, huge lakes with their own clouds standing over them protectively, reflected in the water below so that their twins were standing tall in an upside down world.Down down she flew, exhilarated despite all to be returning to Earth againout of the glider, standing on a runway in the Sahara, in the windit was beyond compare superb, a huge rush and infusion of the real.Just the sky standing dark and clear over her, the wind pouring through her from the west, the naked sun on her bare face.Oh my God.This the home.To walk the side of your own planet and breathe it in, to throw yourself out into the spaces you breathed  The town at the foot of this elevator was painfully white, with colors accenting doorways and window frames, a cheery Mediterranean look with an Islamic touch in the crowding, the town wall, the minarets.Somewhat like Morocco to the northwest.Oasis architecture, classic and satisfying: for what town was not an oasis, in the end.Topologically this town was no different from Terminator.And yet the people were thin and small, bent and dark.Wizened by sun, broiled a bit, surebut it was more than that.Someone had to run the harvesters in the rice and sugarcane fields, check the irrigation canals or robots, install things, fix things.Humans were still not only the cheapest robots around, but also, for many tasks, the only robots that could do the job.They were self reproducing robots too.They showed up and worked, generation after generation; give them three thousand calories a day and a few amenities, a little time off, and a strong jolt of fear, and you could work them at almost anything.Give them some ameliorative drugs and you had a working class, reified and coglike.Again she saw: a big minority of Earths population did robot work, and that had never gone away, no matter what political theories said.Of the eleven billion people on Earth, at least three billion were in fear when it came to housing and feeding themselveseven with all the cheap power pouring down from space, even with the farmworlds growing and sending down a big percentage of their food.Nooff in the sky they were bashing out new worlds, while on old Earth people still suffered.It never got less shocking to see it.And things arent fun anymore when you know that there are people starving while you play around.But we grow your food up there, you can cry in protest, and yet it does nothing to say it.Something is stopping the food from getting through.There continues to be more people than the system can accommodate.So there is no answer.And it is hard to keep your mind on your work when so many people are out of luck.So something had to be done.Why is it like this?Swan asked Zasha, for lack of anyone else.Z was up helping some project in Greenland.Theres never been a plan, Zasha said in her ear.They had had this conversation before, Zs patient tone seemed to say.Were always dealing with the crisis of the moment.And old ways die hard.Everyone on Earth could have lived at an adequate level for at least the last five centuries.Weve had the power and resources relative to the needs, we could have done it.But that was never the project, so its never happened.But why not now, with all the power at our command?I dont know.It just hasnt happened.There are too many old poisons in peoples heads, I guess.Also, immiseration is a terror tactic.If a population is decimated, then the remaining ninety percent are docile.Theyve seen what can happen and they take what they can get.But is that true?Swan cried.I dont believe it!Why wouldnt people fight harder once they saw?I dont know.Maybe it could have happened, but instead theres been the sea level rise and the climate catastrophes to make everything that much harder.Theres always a crisis.All right, but why not now?Well, sure, but whos going to do it?People would do it for themselves if they could!You would think so.I would because its true!If they arent doing it, theyre being held back from it somehow.There are guns in their faces, somehow.A silence from Zasha, whom it seemed was dealing with some distraction.Finally: Its been said that when societies are stressed, they dont actually face up to their problem but look away instead, put on blinkers and go into denial.Whats historical is pretended to be natural, and people fractionate into tribal loyalties.Then they fight over what are perceived to be shortages.You hear it said that they never got over the food panics at the end of the twenty first century, or during the Little Ice Age.Two hundred years have passed and yet its still a deeply felt world trauma.And in fact they still dont have much in the way of a food surplus, so in a way its a rational fear for them to have.They are balanced at the tip of a whole tangle of prostheses, like a Tower of Babel, and it all has to function successfully for things to work.Thats true everywhere!Sure, sure.But there are so many of them here.True, Swan said, looking at the crowds pushing and shoving through the medina.Beyond the town wall, irregular lines of people were bent in the early slant of sun, harvesting strawberries.Its so hot and dirty, and so damned heavy.Maybe theyre simply weighed down by this planet, rather than their history.Maybe.Its just the way it is, Swan.Youve been here before.Yes, but not here.Have you been to China?Of course.India?Yes.Well, youve seen it, then.As for Africa, people say its a development sink.Outside aid disappears into it and nothing ever changes.Ruined long ago by slavers, they say.Full of diseases, torched by the temperature rise.Nothing to be done.The thing is, now those are the conditions everywhere.The industrial rust belts are just as bad.So you could say Earth itself is now a development sink.The marrow has been sucked dry, and most of the upper classes went to Mars long ago.But it doesnt have to be that way!I suppose not.So why arent we helping?Were trying, Swan.We really are.But the population of Mercury is half a million people, and the population of Earth is eleven billion.And its their place.We cant just come down and tell them what to do.In fact we can barely keep them from coming up and telling us what to do!So it isnt that simple.You know that.Yes.But now Im thinking about what it means, I guess.What it means for us.You know Inspector Genettes people IDed that ship we visited inside Saturn, and they found it belonged to a company in Chad.Chad is just a tax haven.Is that why you came down there?I suppose.Why not?Swan, please leave that part of things to Inspector Genette and his people.Its time for you to help assemble the inoculants and seed stock and everything were going to buy on Earth and ship home.All right, Swan said unhappily.But I want to stay in touch with the inspector too.Theyre on Earth too, looking into things.Sure.But in matters like these, a time comes when the data analysts take over.You have to be patient and wait for the next move.What if the next move is another attack on Terminator?Or somewhere else?I dont think we have the luxury to be patient anymore.Well, but some things you can help with and others you cant.Tell you whatcome see me and talk it over.Ill give you all the latest on whats really happening there.All right, I will.But Im going to take the long way there.Swan wandered the Earth.She flew to China and spent several days there, taking the train from one city to another.All the cities had most of their neighborhoods arranged as work units, factories that people lived in all their lives, as on Venus.From childhood they had plug ins in their fingertips, and forearms tattooed with all kinds of apps.They ate a diet that gave them their legally required doses of supplements and drugs.This was not unusual on Earth, but nowhere else was it so prevalent as in China, despite which it was not much noticed or remarked on.Swan found out about it because she contacted one of Mqarets colleagues who worked in Hangzhou.Mqaret wanted her to give these people a blood sample, and as she was wandering anyway, she went by.All the great old coastal cities had been semi drowned by the sea rise, and though this had not killed them, it had spurred intense building sprees slightly inland, on land that would remain permanently above water even if all the ice on Earth melted.This new infrastructure favored Hangzhou over Shanghai, and though most of the new buildings and roads were inland of the ancient city, the old town still served as the cultural heart of the region.There was still a big tidal bore that ran up the funnel shaped estuary of the Qiantang River, and people still rode it on small watercraft of various sorts.It looked like they were having fun despite all.Good old Earth, so huge and dirty, the sky looking as if chewed by a brown fungus, the water the color of pale mud, the land stripped and industrializedbut all of it still out in the wind, flattened hard by its g and yet at the same time stiff with reality.Walking around the crowded alleys of the old city, Swan got Pauline to help her with Chinese dialects she didnt catch.It slowed down her speech but it didnt matter.The Chinese were intent on themselves and looked right through her.Surely this was part of what the Venusians had run from: everyone fixed on their inner space or their life in the work unit, to the exclusion of everything else.Surely none of these people would ever conceive a hatred against spacers: affairs outside China were in the realm of hungry ghosts.Even the life outside ones work unit was ghostly.Or so it seemed as she sat in dives, slurping noodles and chatting with tired men who would give her a moment because a tall spacer asking them questions was unusual.And people seemed to be more tolerant in noodle shops.On the street she got some hard looks, once a shouted insult.She hurried the last part of the way to Mqarets colleagues.Once there she let them take a few tubes of blood and run a few tests on her eyesight and balance and such.Back on the street, it seemed to her that there were many pairs of eyes just as interested in her as Mqarets colleagues had been.Possibly this was just her becoming frightened.She picked up her pace through the inevitable crowdalways at least five hundred people in view when in China.Back in her hostel she could only wonder at her fear of the crowd.But in fact, after falling asleep she woke up to find herself confined by restraints, her room lit only by medical monitors.The bed was attending to all her bodily needs, and she guessed there was a drug in her IV feed triggering her speech centers, because she was talking away without meaning to, even when she tried to stop herself.A disembodied voice from behind her head asked questions, about Alex and everything else, and she babbled away helplessly.Pauline was no help at allseemed to have been turned off.And Swan could not resist the impulse to talk.It was not that unlike her normal self; indeed it was a bit of a relief to be able to go on and on without having to make excuses.Someone was making her do it, so she would.Later she came to in the same bed, unrestrained, her clothing on a chair by the bed.The room was just barely bigger than the bed.Her same hostel room, yes.The AI at the desk, a green box sitting on the counter, said that it had seen no sign anything was wrong.The room monitor had shown her vital signs good, no incursions into the room, nothing unusual.Swan turned on Pauline, who could not offer any help.It had been almost exactly twenty four hours since she had left the clinic of Mqarets friends.She called Mercury House in Manhattan and told them what had happened, then called Zasha.Everyone was shocked, concerned, and sympathetic, urging her to go immediately to the nearest Mercury House to get medical attention, and so on; but at the end of all that, Zasha said firmly, You were on Earth alone.There are any number of malignancies down here, as I told you.Its not like it was when you took your first sabbaticals.We tend to travel in packs here now.You saw what happened last time you went off by yourself, at my place.But that was just some kids.Who was it this time?I dont know.Call Jean Genette at once.They may be able to track who did it.Or we may be able to deduce it by what happens next.They were probably on a fishing expedition in your head.That means it probably wont happen again, but you should always travel with other people, maybe even a security team.No.Zasha let her listen to how that sounded.Swan said, I guess I have to.I dont know.It feels like I just had a bad dream.Im a little hungry, but I think they IVed me food.They had meI mean, I was babbling!And a lot of their questions were about Alex.I may have just told them everything I know about her!Hmm.A long silence.Well, you see why Alex kept so much to herself.So who were they?I dont know.Possibly some part of the Chinese government.They play rough sometimes.Although this seems a bit egregious.Maybe its a warning signal, but of what Im not sure.So in that sense it wasnt a very good warning.Maybe it was just a fishing expedition.Or a notice that we arent to fool around on Earth.As if we didnt know that.But you dont seem to know it.Maybe they dont want you down here fooling around.But who?I dont know!Consider it a message from the people of Earth.And call Genette.And come talk to me, please, before you get into any more trouble.So Swan called Inspector Genette, who was disturbed to hear about her experience.Maybe we should keep Pauline and Passepartout in a permanent link while were on Earth, he suggested.I could stay aware of your movements.But youre always telling me lets turn them off!Not here.This is a different situation, and here they can help.All right, Swan said.Its better than traveling with bodyguards.Well, it isnt anything like that much protection.You should at least travel with other people.Im going to see Zasha.Hes in Greenland, so I should be safe.Good.You should get out of China.But Im Chinese!You are a Mercurial of Chinese extraction.It isnt at all the same.Interplan doesnt have an agreement with China, so I cant help you legally when youre there.Go to Greenland.That night she went out for noodles, stubbornly.People looked at her strangely.She was a stranger in a strange land.On the screens in the noodle shops she heard several fiery speeches denouncing various political crimes of the Hague, Brussels, the UN, Marsspacers in general.Some speakers became so infuriated that she had to revise her opinion of Chinese detachment; they were as intense as anyone else, politically speaking, no matter their inward look on the street.Like any group, they had been shaped by their zeitgeist, and had had targets suggested to them such that their discontents were aimed away from Beijing.So, possibly space could be pulled into peoples red zone and attacked as an enemy.She listened to the screen speeches intently, ignoring the men in the shop watching her watch, and it became clear to her at last that there was a widespread view in China that spacers were living in outrageous decadence and luxury, like the colonialist powers of old, only more so.And she could see perfectly well also that in Hangzhou people lived like rats in a maze, jostling shoulder to shoulder every moment of the day.The potential for extreme thoughts was obvious.Throw a rock at the rich kids housewhy not?Who wouldnt do it?On the flights to get to Zasha she looked at the news on her screen.Earth Earth Earth.They didnt give a damn about space, most of them.Some lived by religious beliefs that had been backward looking in the twelfth century.The pastoralists below her in central Asia ran flocks and herds like the expert ecologists they had to be to produce as much as was demanded of them; each pasture was dairy, stockyard, and soil factory, and their owners were stuffed with anger at the droughts brought on by rich people elsewhere.She saw huge conurbations here and there, meaning shantytowns in dust bowls or falling apart in tropical downpours and mudslides, the stunted occupants coping with problems of survival.Back in Chad she had seen clear signs of heavy internal parasite loads.She had seen hunger, disease, premature death.Wasted lives in blasted biomes.Basic needs not met for three billion of the eleven billion on the planet.Three billion was a lot already, but there were also another five or six billion teetering on the brink, about to slide into that same hole, never a day free of worry.The great precariat, wired in enough to know their situation perfectly well.That was life on Earth.Split, fractionated, divided into castes or classes.The wealthiest lived as if they were spacers on sabbatical, mobile and curious, actualizing themselves in all the ways possible, augmenting themselvesgenderizingspeciatingdodging death, extending life.Whole countries seemed like that, in fact, but they were small countriesNorway, Finland, Chile, Australia, Scotland, California, Switzerland; on it went for a few score more.Then there were struggling countries; then the patchwork post nations, the cobbled together struggles against failure, or the completely failed.The eleven meter rise in sea level on Earth had been accommodated all around the world by intensive building on higher ground, but the costs in human suffering had been huge, and no one wanted to have to do it again.People were sick of sea level rise.How they despised the generations of the Dithering, who had heedlessly pushed the climate into a change with an unstoppable momentum to it, continuing not only into the present but for centuries more to come, as methane clathrate releases and permafrost melting began to outgas the third great wave of greenhouse gases, possibly the largest of them all.They were on their way to being a jungle planet, and the prospect was so alarming that there was serious talk of trying atmospheric sunblocks again, despite the disaster two centuries before.
