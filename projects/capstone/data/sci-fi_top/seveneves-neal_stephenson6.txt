In the sudden silence that followed the engines shutoff, Dinah could hear distant, tinny shouting.She realized it was an open audio channel from Izzy, coming from a pair of headphones she had ripped off her head during the maneuver.It was the sound of people in the Tank.When she pulled the phones back onto her head she could tell that they were celebrating.THAT WAS A BIG ASS DELTA VEE YOU GUYS JUST RIPPED OFF!DOOB said when he heard Dinahs voice on the other end of the link.You deserve congratulations.Dinahs response, after a few seconds delay, was guarded.But not big ass enough?It was strange hearing the voice of one you knew well modulated through this old school audio tech.Like hearing Dinah doing a Buzz Aldrin impression at a party.The emotional nuance came through more clearly than the actual words.Konrad is still calculating your params, Doob said, but just on visual inspection we can see how much you slowed down.Fantastic.Sounds like well be needing another pass then, she said.Meaning that they would have to wait for Ymir to loop once more around the Earth, and do another burn at her next perigee, in order to slow down enough to rendezvous with Izzy.This time you can work with a higher perigee, he pointed out, so you dont have to fly that damn piece of ice through the pea soup again.Flying this damn piece of ice kind of stresses me out, Dinah allowed.The glass is half full, baby, Doob said.The glass is half full.You lit that candle.It worked.You bounced off the atmosphere.Youre a hell of a lot closer to usKonrad is saying your apogee is definitely sublunar.Meaning that Ymir would turn around and start falling back toward the Earth before reaching the orbit of the former moon.This is huge, he added.It is going to change the picture politically.After a lengthy pause, Dinah asked, Politically?as if she couldnt quite believe what she had heard.IM AWARE OF THE FACT THAT IVY HAS TURNED A DEAF EAR TO ALL of your ideas, Julia began, just as soon as Spencer had typed in the commands that disconnected Arklet 453 from the Situational Awareness Network.I presume she also went out of her way to place obstacles in the path of your coming here for this meeting.The MartiansDr.Katherine Quine, Ravi Kumar, and Li Jianyulooked somewhat nonplussed.It was always difficult to travel between arklets.The waiting time for nonurgent Flivver trips was about two days, and emergencies could rearrange the queue at the last minute.As a member of the General Population, Dr.Quine had the most Olympian perspective on thisshe was an urgent care doctor frequently called upon to make excursions to arklets.She was about ten years older than Kumar and Jianyu, who were Arkies chosen in the Casting of Lots from India and China respectively.Those two had ended up together in Arklet 303, which had turned out to be a hotbed of Martian agitation.It was part of a triad with a total population of eighteen, half of whom currently had the flu, and so Katherine Quine had had a legitimate excuse to go there.Shed made the most of the opportunity by scooping up Ravi and Jianyu and coming here with them.Of the people in this conversation, she was probably the least inclined to see dark deeds by Ivy in the slowness of inter arklet transport.It was a different story with Ravi and with Jianyu, who, for a number of reasons, were receptive to Julias suggestions on that front.In another time and place, Dr.Quine might have quibbled.But time was short, and trying to raise Julias opinion of the Cloud Arks current management did not seem like an efficient way to use it.So she let it go.And by the time she had processed all of that, Julia had moved on anyway.Given that, Im all the more appreciative that you made the arduous and risky journey to meet with me in person, Julia said.It is my firm conviction that, centuries from now, young Martians sitting in classrooms on the Red Planet will read in their history booksor whatever they have in place of booksabout this meeting and what came of it.Ravi Kumar raised an index finger.Instead of educating the young in classrooms, he said, why not do away altogether with the traditional structure of mass education and take a personalized, individualized approach?Theres no reason to repeat Earths mistakes on Mars.I could not agree with you more, Julia said, and these sorts of fresh ideas only make me more eager to find a way of getting as many people there as soon as possible.How do we get started?What would be entailed in sending a forward advance party to Mars?For the second time in as many minutes, Dr.Quine looked a bit unsettled.She glanced around Arklet 453.This was the central, common space arklet of the heptad that included numbers 174the abode of Julia and Camilaand 215that of Spencer Grindstaff.Or at least that was what it said on the official records.Some reshuffling had occurred.All the men and women who lived in those two arklets now seemed to conceive of themselves as members of J. B. F. s personal staff.They had taken over 453 and turned it into a sort of West Wing.Katherine Quine said, Presuming we had authorization to send such a mission Let me just cut you off there, if you would indulge me, Dr.Quine.What you just raised is a matter of politics.I consider that to be my superpower and I would like to place it at the disposal of you and the other members of the Martian Communitythe ones you already know of, the ones who sympathize with you in secret, and others who may sign on once it becomes clear to them what a fundamentally sensible idea the Mars trip really is.So I would propose that we assume, for purposes of this little chat, that authorization is not a problem.I would like to see you three using your own superpower of designing this mission in a way that makes sense without letting the political dimension interfere at all.Once we have designed a coherent plan, we can then move on to questions of implementation.In a perfect scenario we would dump the rock and simply take everything, all at once, Jianyu said.It was the first time he had spoken, but he seemed to have been emboldened by Julias talk of superpowers.There are powerful forces that would have to be convinced before such a thing could happen, Julia said.Lets think in terms of an advance party: lean, efficient, smart, but big enough to get the job done.That means landing on Mars and reporting back to the remainder of the Cloud Ark.Weve been talking about such a mission.We think we could do it with a bolo consisting of a heptad and a triad, Katherine said.Ten arklets, Julia said.That doesnt seem all that many, does it?During the initial delta vee, Ravi Kumar said, the arklets would be stacked.Once they were on course for Mars they would form a bolo, so that the members of the expedition could experience Earth normal gravity during the six month journey.Jianyu added, Propulsion and other components could come from the MIV kit.Most of the design work has already been done for us.Katherine said, Aerobraking would be needed at the end, to slow it down.Before that, the bolo could be reeled in, the arklets could restack into a unified ship, and there would be time to survey the surface from orbit and decide on a landing place.Julia nodded.And if I may put a hard question to you all, what would be the survival time of this isolated colony, once it had landed?How long before it ran out of provisions?This caused the three Martians to clam up and look at one another.I only ask, Julia said, because politicsmy departmentonce again rears its ugly head here.Once your heroics have been accomplished, the burden falls to me to seal the deal, as it were.The advance party lands and sends back its joyous message.A ticking clock element enters the picture.Which I do not mean in a negative waythis can be a powerful incentive to mobilize peoples energies, as we saw in the case of the buildup to the Hard Rain.It is at that point when I can address the people of the Cloud Ark and say, Here is the opportunitywill we seize it?Or will we shrink away from it and let these brave people slowly expire?That is a speech that I think I could deliver to great effect.I just need to have some sense of the time element.A year for sure, Katherine said.Beyond that, it becomes a medical question.A statistical question.Statistics, Julia repeated, and sighed.I have been hearing a lot about that from Dr.Harris.SO, YOURE TELLING ME WEVE LOST TRACK OF WHO IS EVEN IN J. B. F. S heptad?Ivy asked.There was silence around the big table in the Banana.Ivy had begun to hold important meetings in this old familiar space, closer to the central axis of the Stack and farther forward in Amaltheas cone of shelter.It wouldnt do to have the Cloud Arks command structure decapitated by a single unlucky bolide strikea disaster much more likely to happen whenever they met in the big T3 spaces like the Tank and the Farm.Present for this meeting were Doob, Luisa, Fyodor, and three handpicked members of Markuss staff who had become a sort of executive troika: Sal Guodian, the one man judicial system.Tekla, the head of security.And Steve Lake, the dreadlocked ginger who was responsible for network and computer matters.The default system for keeping track of who is where, Sal began, is based on the assumption that people will actually cooperate with it.Ivy held up a hand.Stop.Before you go into explanations, I need a yes or no.Yes, Steve Lake said, we have lost track of who is in J. B. F. s heptad.Thank you, Ivy said.And somehow the SAN isnt helping us fill in the gaps?Steve said, One of the people who is definitely in that heptad is Spencer Grindstaff.Ivy nodded.Sal said, Steve, when Markus pulled you into his office, just before the White Sky, and put you in charge of the networkreplacing Spenceryou made some remark to the effect that Spencer might know of back doors into Izzys systems.Back doors that would be impossible for you to know about until he used them.Yeah, Steve said.Almost by definition, we cant find something like that until its used.Not without manually reading through every line of code.You think he has a back door into the SAN?We know hes doing something, Steve said, because as soon as he turned up there, the arklets in J. B. F. s heptad began dropping off the network from time to time.Whenever shes having a meeting she doesnt want us to know about, he turns everything off.Ivy considered this for a moment, then looked across the table at Tekla and nodded.Tekla rosecarefully, for the gravity was quite weak hereand went to the door.She opened it to reveal Zeke Petersen waiting outside, and waved him in.Thanks for joining us, Ivy said, breaking a silence during which Zeke took a seat at the foot of the table.Ivy was at the head of it.She was looking up a long ski jump ramp at him, and he was doing likewise at her.Just like old times, Commander Xiao, Zeke said.Well, I appreciate your loyalty, Ivy said.I know this must be awkward for you.Not at all, actually, Zeke said.The announcement that Markus made, when he called it, at the onset of the Hard Raindeclaring all existing nations to be dissolvedI took that to heart.Julia didnt hear that announcement.She didnt get the memo.Weve been hearing a little about Spencers ability to disconnect from SAN.Zeke nodded.Confirmed.I was there for one such incident.We had a very strange conversation.I think they were testing the waters to see whether I might be recruited.She spoke to me as if I were already on her sideas if it were unthinkable that I wouldnt be.Its a pretty good persuasive techniqueshe had me going for a little bit.But once I got out of there and slept on it, I saw how crazy it was.Did you have the sense that this was a one off?Or was she working her way down a list of possible recruits?If I had to guess, Id say there was a list, Zeke said, but not a long list.Ivy nodded.She didnt have to spell it out: J. B. F.  might have recruited some othersothers they didnt know about yet.It tallies with what I saw, Doob said, and glanced at Luisa for a confirming nod.I think she is just being opportunistic.She reaches out to people, draws them into conversations, drops hints, probes for vulnerabilities.Is she nuts?Ivy asked Luisa.In a sense it doesnt matter, Luisa said.If shes making trouble, shes making trouble.Tracing that to a diagnosable psychiatric condition doesnt really change anything.It might change the approach that we take.She was narcissistic to begin with, Luisa said.This isnt a formal diagnosis, mind you.But according to what we heard from you and Dinah, her trip up to Izzy was pretty traumatic.She lost her husband and her child and blood was spilled along the way.It doesnt take a trained professional to guess that she is suffering from some level of PTSD.Connected with that we might expect her to have a dark, paranoid vision of the world.But she may have been that way to begin with.Shes cagey, Ivy said.As long as all shes doing is talking to people, theres not much I can or should do.Agreed, Luisa said.She is building a political base among the Arkies.If you take some action against her, with your sole pretext being that shes talking to a lot of people, then youve given her just what she wants.But some outreach on your part to the Arkies might be a good idea.Ivy sighed.The only answer to politics is more politics, she said, and thats where Im most useless.Deeds, not words, Zeke said.Thats what really matters.And when Ymir pulls in, you and Markus will have accomplished something thats going to make J. B. F.  and her clique look puny.I MAY BE OUT OF MY DEPTH HERE, JULIA SAID, AFTER A LONG AND thoughtful pause, but we seem to have a striking coincidence that is staring us right in the face.Go on, Madam President, Camila urged her.It might be obvious to you, but I for one cannot see it.Julia looked at Katherine Quine.As I understand it, the key elements of the proposed Mars ship are a heptad, for the humans to live in during the voyage, and a triad, for bulk storage of propellants and whatnot.And this matches up quite neatly with our strengths.She managed a self deprecating chuckle.I say our.What do I mean by that?I suppose Im going out on a limb by imagining that there might be some sort of a natural alliance between the Arkie Community and the Martians.A sort of ragtag rebel coalition, if you will.Here in this heptad we have rapidly assembled a social hub for advocacy of concerns relevant to the AC.In a sense we have our own heptad now.And in a like sense, you, Ravi and Jianyu, have developed your triad into an intense focus of Martian advocacy.You have your own triad.So the two largest components of the Mars expedition have already been acquired.They just need to be put together.Ravi was nodding.Two of the engineers on the MIV team are keen on it.They helped build New Caird and are eager to tackle a new problem.Of the two, one might even come with us.Paul Freel.He has been a strong advocate of Mars colonization since long before Zero.Katherine had been listening intently, and now broke in: I dont mean to sound a skeptical note, Madam President, but in what sense do you really have this heptad, or do our friends here have the triad where they live?It might be true in the sense of having majority rule.But But what does ownership really mean in this context?Hmm, yes, it is a very profound question, Dr.Quine, and Im glad you raised it.So many things we took for granted before, such as property rights and individual liberty, are clouded by Markuss declaration of PSAPS.Or martial law, if we want to call a spade a spade.But as a first step toward answering your question, I would suggest that the ability to come and go at will is inextricable from ownershipthats what it would really mean to have an arklet, or a triad, or a heptad.Well, in that sense were really all subject to the collective dictates of the swarm, Katherine said.Parambulator is what decides where we go when.It truly is one of the most insidious instruments of social control ever devised, Julia said.Katherine looked mildly aghast.But without it, we have a disaster.That is what makes it so insidious, Julia said.One can always justify it by making the safety argument.We will all be slaves of Parambulator until and unless someone decides that some things are more important.Jianyu was looking alert and curious.If someone did decide that, he said, it would change nothing unless the arklet in question was switched over to manual control.Its my understanding that this can be done at any time, Julia said.Was I misinformed?No, Jianyu answered, but it would show up very prominently on Parambulator.It would set off alarms all over the Situational Awareness Network.In that case, Julia said, we shall have to deal with the SAN when and if the time comes to take decisive action.IVYS GRANDMOTHER, A GUANGZHOU BORN, HONG KONGRAISED woman who spoke only a few words of English, had ruled the family from a mother in law apartment over a garage in Reseda.Enthroned on a duct taped La Z Boy and swaddled in crocheted afghans, she had handed down a series of diktats, pronunciamentos, and fatwas that had taken on the force of law within her family of three dozen direct descendants and in laws scattered across the San Fernando Valley.While not indifferent to money, love, security, and other common psychological drives, she seemed to have been motivated by another need that was obscure and hence mysterious to most of those who paid fealty to her.Anglos might have Orientalized this as face or Confucian respect for ones elders.Ivy came to understand it as a simple need for attention.Anyone who entered or left the house had to check in with Grandmother.And it was not enough just to poke ones head in the door and say hello or goodbye; one had to sit down in the rattan side chair next to the La Z Boy and spend a few minutes and say a few words.Grandmother had no power to enforce this regulation other than finding arcane and baroque ways to wreak long term revenge on those who flouted it.Julia Bliss Flaherty, as Ivy now realized, was of the same stripe.Pinned down and obliged to justify herself, she would explain her actions in terms of some altruistic plan.And she might even believe it.But it wasnt that at all.She was like Ivys grandmother.If you paid fealty to her, she would favor you, and your reputation and power would grow among all the others who did likewise.If you sent her off to an arklet and ignored her, you became an enemy of her and of her network.She wielded no power other than that.But, ignored long enough, she could become a mighty foe.Her status as an ex presidentand not just any old ex president, but the one who had overseen the construction of the Cloud Ark and even used nuclear weapons to protect itgave her credibility among the Arkies.It had become common to think of those as scattered and demoralized, just waiting for a leader to bring them identity and purpose.Ivy had lost track of whether that was an accurate perception or a self perpetuating myth spread by J. B. F.  In any case, it had taken on the force of reality.She was sitting across the table from Tekla, wondering whether it would be productive to explain all of these thoughts to her.Would this Russian heptathlete care about, or understand, Ivys dead Cantonese grandmother in Reseda?Maybe.But Tekla came from a tradition in which details were hoarded and dispensed on a need to know basis.Presented with too much information, she became baffled, bored, and finally irritated.Toward those who talked too freely, she felt the same sort of contempt as a businessman might feel toward a spendthrift.She just wanted to know what her job was.The same quality made it difficult to get inside Teklas head.But that was okay.In a big organization with a military style chain of command, you didnt have to be everyones friend and treasured colleague.Markus understood as much, which was why he had ended up running the place.More Ivys speed had been the boutique operation that had been Izzy at Zero.Markus would have been terrible at that.This thing with Julia is a distraction.Nothing more, Ivy said.Much more important things demand my focus.Making a big deal out of it will backfiregive her more power than she deserves.But we cant ignore what she is doing.Tekla was nodding.Good.I want you to go and visit her heptad, Ivy continued.You will go there in your capacity as Markuss security chief.Do you understand?It is an official visit.You will explain that there have been problems with the Situational Awareness Network that could have dangerous consequences unless they are fixed.Beyond that, I just want you to listen to her.Because I think that she will try to bring you over to her side.Its what she does with everyone.You would be a prize catch.If she does as you predict, Tekla said, what should be my response?It was a measure of Ivys navet that she didnt even follow Teklas question at first.Then she understood that Tekla was suggesting she might pretend to become one of Julias followers.She was volunteering to become a mole in Julias network.Tekla stolidly watched Ivys face as Ivy figured it out.I would suggest taking no immediate action, Ivy said.Which, in truth, was Ivy being not so much cagey as timid.Of course, Tekla said, to show eagerness is poor tactics, it will only arouse her suspicion.Ivy said nothing.Tekla explained, I know many people with such minds.And you obviously dont, honey.My suggestion is that you report to me in person first and then we will come to a decision.We?I.  I will come to a decision.It is good that we meet here.In the Banana, Tekla said.You like it?Tekla looked nonplussed.It is not that I like it.The Banana is more secure.From bolides, you mean.Tekla shook her head.From Grindstaff.Then she stood upcarefully, so as not to fly up and bang her head on the ceilingand departed, leaving Ivy alone with a head full of questions.Had she really just embarked on the project of setting up an internal espionage network within the Cloud Ark?How was she going to explain that to Markus?Would he be horrified, or impressed?In either case, how would she feel about his reaction?When the hell was Dinah going to get back so that they could discuss this kind of thing over distilled spirits?And what had Tekla meant by that last comment, that the Banana was more secure from Grindstaff?It was old, pre Zero, and so its connection to the SAN was retrofitted and kludgy.Tekla seemed to be suggesting that if Spencer could hack the SAN to the extent of disconnecting Julias arklets from it, then maybe he could also hack it to the extent of placing other parts of the Cloud Arkincluding the Farm, the Tank, and Markuss officeunder surveillance.I know many people with such minds, Tekla had said.She was talking about Russian military and intelligence types, accustomed to the byzantine thoughtways of those professions.Perhaps Tekla herself had once been groomed as an intelligence asset.If Tekla really did become a mole in Julias network, then how could Ivy be sure that she was a straight up mole, loyal to Ivy, and not a double agent, loyal to Julia?THE SCRAPE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE HAD LEFT YMIR TUMBLING slowly as it hurtled away from the Earth on its new orbit.Calculating exactly what that orbit was took them fifteen or twenty minutes, and told them that they had fewer than four hours in which to take actions needed to save their lives.If all had gone perfectly, the nuclear burn would have slowed Ymir down to the point where a rendezvous with Izzy could then have been achieved with a few small additional delta vees.They had hoped this might happen, but not seriously expected it.The best they could really hope for was to shed some velocity and reduce the height of their apogee.That figurethe distance separating the Earth and the ship at the top of her orbitwas directly related to how much velocity she had at the bottom.Because Ymir had fallen in from an extremely high apogee, far beyond the moons former orbit, she had come in screaming hot for her skip off the atmosphere.Every bit of velocity that was killed by the huge nuclear retro rocket burn, or by friction with the air, translated into a lower altitude at the succeeding apogee, whichdepending on how the numbers had worked outwould occur weeks, days, or hours later.The answer, once they had run the numbers, turned out to be hours.In one sense, Ymir had missed her target by a mile; the total delta vee she had achieved had been less than a third of what theyd hoped for.And yet this had been enough to bring her apogee down from far beyond the moons orbit to a figure only about thrice the altitude at which Izzy circled the Earth.Likewise, the periodthe amount of time it took to complete an orbithad dropped from seventy five days to a mere eight hours.The lesson being that huge alterations in those figures could be purchased for comparatively small amounts of delta vee.Bringing Ymir the rest of the way down to Izzys orbit, on the other hand, would require twice as much delta vee as theyd wrung out of the burn just completed.Long before worrying about that, however, they would have to survive the next eight hours.Ymirs apogee might have been radically altered, but her perigee altitude was unchangedmeaning that it was still dangerously low.If they took no action, the next go round would therefore bring them roaring and bouncing across the top of the atmosphere again.On one level, raising the perigee a bit, so that theyd never have to worry about the atmosphere again, was an easy task.They could do it with a small but precisely calibrated burn at apogee.In a normal space mission, such a thing would have been straightforward.Here, it was complicated by two factors.First of all, their success in lowering the apogee, and shortening the period, had imposed a tight deadlinefour hours after perigeewhen that burn needed to occur.The second complication was the ships slow tumble.This meant that their nuclear rocket engine was never pointed in the right direction, save by lucky accident.During the big burn at perigee, they had wanted the nozzle pointed forward, so that it would serve as a huge retro rocket.The upcoming burn at apogee was intended to speed her up a bit, and so they needed the nozzle pointed aft.But as long as she tumbled, it was aimed in no particular direction.So their task now was to stabilize Ymirs attitude by using her thrusters to push back against the unwanted rotation.And, as they had discovered the first time theyd tried it, her thrusters were small and weak compared to the momentum of the big ice shard.In aerospace lingo, they lacked control authority.Ymir was like a truck skidding on a patch of oil, responding only faintly to the steering wheel.That problem had been alleviated somewhat by the large expenditure of mass during the burn.Many tons of ice had been hurled out the nozzle in the form of steam.Ymir was lighter and more wieldy as a result.Calculating exactly how much more wieldy she was, and what it meant for the thrusters control authority, was, in itself, a significant task that consumed another half an hour just for a rough estimate.The result was not encouraging.In the three hours remaining, there was simply no way that Ymirs attitude control thrustersdesigned for tiny adjustments over long spans of timecould neutralize her tumble.The tumble wasnt especially fastthe crew in the command module could barely sense that they were rotatingbut it was enough to make the next rocket burn impossible.And if they couldnt make that burn in three hours, theyd scrape the atmosphere again in an additional four, and again eight hours after that.They might survive one more ride like the first one, but they couldnt survive two.Once all of this had become clear to Markus, he had divided the crew in half, leaving Dinah and Jiro in the command modules common room to look after the propulsion system and going above with Vyacheslav to consider the problem of attitude control.Dinahs task was, comparatively speaking, routine.During the perigee burn, they had expended most of the ice stored in the hoppers.Some of the augers had jammed, and the whole ice mining operation had been thrown into general disarray as she had improvised solutions to problems that came at her from every direction.Robots were in the wrong places; some hoppers were overfull while others were empty.New ice needed to be mined and old ice needed to be rearranged.Fixing all of that in time for another burn in three hours was not an insuperable task, but it would require her full attention.Likewise, Jiro had a few reactor issues to think about.Both of them would have to toil diligently between now and the apogee burn in order to be ready.Assuming, that is, that the other half of the crew had, in the meantime, figured out a way to get Ymir aimed in the right direction.Markus had moved that job to another part of the ship where it wouldnt pose a distraction to the propulsion crew.Or such was his intent; but in moments when Dinah lost focus briefly, while compiling some code or foraging for a snack, she found herself wondering what they were doing up there.By process of elimination, it had to be something involving New Caird.They had already demonstrated that Ymirs thrusters werent up to the task.Only New Cairds main engine had enough thrust to make a difference.The problem was that it was pointed in one fixed direction, which didnt happen to be the one in which they actually needed to push.Following that chain of reasoning to its logical conclusion made her nervous, to the point where she was almost more distracted than she would have been had Markus and Slava been working in the same room with her.She held her curiosity and her trepidation at bay until she was certain that the engine would have enough ice to achieve the apogee burn.Her work was finished.Half an hour remained.Jiro seemed to have his side of it under control.A sharp thud, resounding through the walls of the command module, gave her an excuse to pull up some video and to eavesdrop on the audio channel that Markus and Slava were using.Robots salted all over Ymirs exterior gave her eyes that she could turn in any direction.Even so, it took her a few minutes to obtain a picture of what was going on.New Caird had undocked from Ymir and was nowhere to be seen.Presumably Markus was at her controls.A man in a space suit was visible on the outside of Ymir, walking toward the stern by using a pair of Grabbs as mobile anchor points.This had to be Vyacheslav.His feet had sprouted thick white whiskers.It took Dinah a few moments to make sense of the image: he had zip tied each foot to the back of a Grabb, and the whiskers were the protruding ends of the zip ties.It was the kind of improvisation that would have made old school NASA engineers turn over in their graves, had the Hard Rain not eliminated that possibility.But in the last two years, and particularly the last two weeks, this kind of hillbilly engineering had become routine.Which only made the question of what the hell Markus was up to more compelling.If Slava was being that creative with two robots and a sack of zip ties ...She finally spotted New Caird on a camera belonging to a Bucky that was attached to the stern of the shard, about halfway between its edge and the cavernous maw of the nozzle.The little ship was hanging in space maybe a hundred meters away, white jets erupting from her attitude thrusters every few moments as she tried to keep station behind the slowly rotating shard.Markus was flying her by hand, and it was some fancy flying indeed.The geometry was difficult to visualize, but Dinah convinced herself that Vyacheslav was walking toward the same general location that New Caird was aimed at.In their own ways, the two men were focused on the same part of the shard: one of its outermost corners, where the widest part of the sugarloaf terminated and connected to its base, along a sharp but irregular edge.There, embedded in the ice, was a scrap of structural framework about the size of a car.It served as the anchor for a cluster of small conical rocket nozzles: one of those thruster systems that had proven so miserably underpowered for the current job.Aiming another camera at it, Dinah saw a steady jet of blue white fire emerging from two of the nozzles.They were burning continuously, full blast.They werent designed to do that.But Ymirs attitude control system had calculated that thrust, and a lot of it needed to be applied in those two directions if its programmed objectivegetting the ships nose pointed forward and her nozzle aftwere to be achieved.Dinah got it.Her thinking was confirmed by the chatter she could now hear, in a mix of English, German, and Russian, between Markus and Vyacheslav.But she could see in her minds eye what Ymir must look like, right now, to Markus, viewing it through the front window of New Caird: a huge drifting arrowhead of black ice, generally dark, but decorated at the nose and corners by twinkling white lights, and streaks of hot gas: the exhaust from the thrusters, running an automatic program controlled from within.Sometimes they flashed on and off.Occasionally, though, when a lot of thrust was called for in one place, they ran for a long time.Those long steady burns would stand out clearly against the dark of space.Markus didnt need to calculate Ymirs rotation in his head.He didnt need to know her spin rates about her three axes or the torque needed to counteract them.He didnt even need to pull up the user interface on his tablet.All he had to do was fly around the shard and look for places where thrusters were staying on continuously.Those were the ones that were overloaded and underpowered.Those were, therefore, the ones where New Cairds big engine could be used most effectively.But how?Her view of the thruster system was interrupted by a blurry gray form: Vyacheslav moving in front of the camera.He then came back into focus, groping for a carabiner along his waist and snapping it onto a structural member that protruded from the ice.Dinah could hear him breathing.Bracing himself with his left hand, he reached into the network of struts with his right.After a bit of groping he seemed to find something, then worked for a minute, his arm reciprocating slightly.The thruster jets faltered and winked out.Done, Vyacheslav said.Apologies.Valve was sticking.Get clear, tovarishch, Markus said.Getting, Slava returned.He unhooked the carabiner and bent away from the framework, trusting himself to the Grabbs zip tied to his feet, and began to move away with the painfully slow gait of a man walking in hot caramel.Just do it, he said, then added a phrase in German that Dinah was pretty sure meant If it doesnt work we are all dead anyway.New Caird drifted out of frame.Dinah spent a few moments reacquiring her view.The smaller ship was closing on Ymir, headed directly for the thruster system that Slava had just shut down, and coming in on an angle between the two nozzles that had been burning.The logic was clear; the method was insane.New Caird was going to do the job that the tiny thrusters couldnt.Markus had to get her big nozzle aimed in about the right direction, namely, about halfway between the two that had been doing all the work.Fine.But he was also going to have to make a mechanical connection between New Caird and the shard, so that the thrust of the big engine could be transmitted into the mass of ice.And it looked like he was going to achieve this by ramming the little ship into the big one.It was a slow ramming, like a tugboat shoving its nose against the side of an oil tanker to nudge it into a berth.But it was ramming nonetheless: not a thing for which spacecraft were generally designed.She relaxed her painfully tight grip on the edge of the table just a bit when, moments before the collision, Markus fired the retro thrusters, slowing New Caird at the moment of impact.But still she felt and heard the crunch resounding through the walls of the ice palace.Shed heard it before over the last couple of hours and wondered what it was; apparently Markus had done this several times already.He had aimed for the place where the structural framework emerged from the ice, forming a sort of angle into which New Cairds nose could trap itself, as long as the thrust stayed on.Right now that force was being delivered by her aft thrusters.But Dinah, watching Markuss face through the front window, saw him working at the touch screen that served as New Cairds control panel, and had a pretty good idea of what was coming next.She pulled up the interface for Ymirs attitude control system and saw craziness: thrusters firing all over the shard, lit up by angry icons warning of too little propellant, not enough time, overheated nozzles.The thing that Markus had just rammed was flashing red, indicating that it wasnt even connected to the system anymore.Graphs at the bottom of the screen, and a three dimensional rendering of the shard in space, showed just how far off they were from where they wanted to be.She heard a little symphony of grinding, groaning, and popping, and felt the ship rotating around her.The video feed showing New Caird was awash in white light as her main propulsion came on full blast.A quick glance at the attitude control plots showed good things happening.It is good, Jiro said, but we are going to over rotate now.Not if I got the timing right, Markus said.We should rotate through the correct attitude just at the time of the apogee burn.Afterward, yes, well over rotate.But well have plenty of time to fix it.Then his transmission was cut off by an exclamation and a thud.He cursed in German, and then the audio went dead.Dinah looked at the video feed to see New Caird canted over at the wrong angle.The flame from the engine flickered out.The framework against which New Caird had been pushing had given way under the thrust of the big engine and crumpled, causing her to slew around.She now lay almost sideways against the ice, the crushed remains of the thruster system sandwiched between her hull and the stern of Ymir.Some kind of gas escaping, Jiro observed quietly.Or smoke.He was right.The eye didnt pick it up right away because smoke behaved differently in space than in an atmosphere, under gravity.But something was burning, or at least smoldering, along the side of New Cairds hull, no more than an arms length from where Markus sat.Vyacheslav said, The hot nozzle of the thruster is melting through the hull.Markus came back on the air.Jiro and Dinah, you must be ready to fire the main propulsion at apogee The word was cut off by a constriction of his throat, and he coughed several times.When he resumed speaking, his voice had a strangled timbre.About two minutes from now.Focus on thatinitiate the startup procedures.Vyacheslav can help me with this little problem.He was coughing convulsively.Switching off, he said.Dinah, against orders, made a last glance at the video feed showing the nose of New Caird.Through its front window she could no longer see Markus.She could see only smoke, and the flickering, lambent light of a fire within it.The realization of what was happening struck her like a two by four across the forehead.She grabbed the edge of the table and closed her eyes for a few moments, felt them fill with hot water, felt the snot flooding into her nose.Dinah, Jiro said.The auger startup checklist begins now.She opened her eyes and saw glowing blurs where user interface widgets ought to have been.If it is to mean anything, Jiro said.Please.Then he reached up to enclose his headsets little microphone with one hand, muffling the sound, and added: He can probably hear us.She reached out and typed a command.Auger one, she said.Go.And she slapped the Enter key.And so on down the list.It got easier as she went.Jiro did his part of it delicately, quietly, efficiently.And when the nuke came on to full power, right on schedule, she made sure to mention it.Loudly.In case Markus could hear them.Only then did she look at the video feed.She was expecting to see Markuss final resting place, a tomb of acrid smoke.But nothing was there except a crumpled framework and Vyacheslav, standing with one hand braced against it, gazing away aft.In the background, a spreading plume of steam the size of Manhattan as Jiros engine fired.Slava?she said.Where is She fell off, Vyacheslav answered.When the engine came on, and we began to accelerate.New Caird did not come along for the ride.Is she She was entrained in the plume of steam and thrown back.I can hardly even see her now.Oh.Dinah?Yes, Slava?Markus was already dead.IT WOULD READ ALMOST AS SLAPSTICK COMEDY IF IT WERE NOT SO tragicthe consequences so dire, Julia said.She was mesmerized by a video loop, the final transmission from New Caird before radio contact had been lost.The people hovering around her in the White Arkletas Julias unofficial base of operations had come to be knownall nodded, or made agreeable sounding murmurs.They were all reading Tavs blog post about the Ymir catastrophe, which had been posted only seconds ago.The one exception was Tekla, who had become distracted by a detail.Attached to the wall of the arklet with strips of blue masking tape was a sheet of paper on which had been printed the seal of the president of the United States.Only two printers remained in existence, and both of them were on Izzy.So, by process of elimination, this must have been printed on Old Earth, prior to the Hard Rain, by a device that had been running a little low on cyan ink.It had seen hard service: it was torn in two places and repaired with clear tape.It had been creased and crumpled, then smoothed out.Its edges were fuzzy where previous applications of tape had been peeled away.And in the white space below and to the right of the presidential seal there was a brown smudge, oval, the size of the ball of a persons thumb.As a matter of fact, Tekla was certain that it was actually a thumbprint, and the more she looked at it the more certain she became that the brown substance was blood.She looked Julia in the eye, and became aware that the former president was awaiting some form of reaction from her.Unlike most people, Tekla felt no pressure, no obligation to fulfill any such expectations.Julia, a bit unnerved by that, broke eye contact and continued: I dont quite understand the story they are telling us anyway!It is pretty convoluted, said one of her aides, a young male Arkie with an American accent.He was one of the MIV engineers.His tone suggested that he was amused by the sheer cheekiness of the powers that be in trying to get people to believe such a yarn, and that he was much too clever to be taken in.It kind of hinges on the idea that the hull was made out of what amounts to plastic.If it gets too hot, it Its like plastic on a stove burner, I understand that, Julia said.It melts and it stinks.New Caird shifted in a way that caused the hull to come into contact with a nozzle that was extremely hot.But according to the story they are putting out, Vyacheslav had shut that nozzle off beforehand.They stay hot for a long time.Anyway, the nozzle melted right through the hull.First it would have made a lot of toxic smoke.That would have been enough to kill him.Then, when the melting proceeded to the point where the hull was perforated, all the air would have escaped through the hole.Well, that is horribleif it is true, Julia said, and then swiveled her eyes toward Tekla, looking for some sign in the visitors face that it might not be true.Tekla stared back at her in a manner that betrayed nothing.What sort of pass have we come to, one wonders, when such crazy improvisations are called forramming one ship with another!More murmurs of agreement.Julia was on a roll.And as far as I can make out, it didnt even solve the problem!Problem is solved, Tekla said.She was fluent in English and was perfectly capable of saying The problem is solved, but sometimes dropped the article for effect.Anglophones found this mysterious and impressive.It was also an implicit statement of Russian pride.The language of the Cloud Ark, by default, was English.That was never going to change.But the dialect was going to evolve over time, and Russians could bend it in their direction by finding ways to inject their grammar and vocabulary into everyday speech.Burn is complete, she went on.But the ship is still tumbling out of control!said the American boy who so fancied his own intelligence.Slow tumble, Tekla said.Not problem.Plenty of time to fix now that perigee is raised.Fix it how?!Markus demolished three of the external thruster packages by ramming them!Who does that?Anyway, there are only two of them left.It is a basic reality of physics that you cant control a three axis tumble using only two thrusters!Thank you for explaining basic reality, Tekla said.Tumble can be eliminated by making scarfed nozzle.This silenced them for a few moments.One of Julias followersJianyu, a Chinese Arkie, very passionate about going to Marslooked like he understood it.Tekla nodded in his direction.This man will explain later.My time here is limited.Yes, Tekla, and we do appreciate that youve been able to make time for us at all, Julia said.Tekla wanted to slap her so much that her hand actually twitched.The sentence Julia had just spoken, had it been delivered in a different tone, might have actually meant what it said.Instead of which, it meant I am being callously ignored and its about time someone important came out to talk to me.Tekla had an almost physical sense of how that mentality was radiating outward from Julia to infect the other Arkies.Like almost everyone else in the Cloud Ark, Tekla was wearing a coverall with many pockets, compartments, external holsters, and the like.One of them contained a knife with a four inch, double edged blade.Its tip could find J. B. F. s heart easily.Tekla faded from the conversation briefly as she considered how to manage this.Julia probably wouldnt be expecting a frank assassination attemptthough you never really knew, with people who had such minds.Tekla said, Would you like to report any difficulties with the SAN?Repeated outages have been observed.Julia pressed her lips together in a satisfied way and looked toward Spencer Grindstaff.First Ive heard of it, Spencer said.The statement was met with perfect, deadpan silence.Tekla just waited.Soon the temptation to boast would get the better of them.Her training in tradecraftin how to be a spyhad not been all that extensive.A few basic courses, some assigned reading.The reason was simple: She was too conspicuous to be useful as a spy.Too similar to the Hollywood profile.Real spies went unnoticed.So they had kicked her out of the program and put her to work in roles, such as being an Olympic athlete, where her conspicuousness was an asset.But she had picked up a few general precepts.And she knew that this one thingthe urge to boast of ones accomplishmentshad betrayed more secrets and destroyed more careers than anything else.She looked at Grindstaff.Unlike most people, who soon broke eye contact, he looked right back at her, grinning.Unusual, Tekla said, for one of your background.Sources and methods, he said.Then I will confine my remarks to what I came here for, Tekla said.This produced an immediate exchange of glances between Julia and Spencer.Tekla ignored it.For security reasons it is imperative that we have accurate census of which person is in which arklet.Some people like to move around.To trade places.We understand.Fine.But safety and security problems are created when, for example, arklet is struck by bolide, air is leaking, we do not know how many people are in it, their medical requirements, et cetera.Small person needs less air than big person.Julia was nodding.I take your point very clearly, Tekla.Speaking for the Arkie Community, I can confirm that a more informal mind set prevails out here on the outskirts.The perception of neglect by the powers that be on Izzy leads to a bit of a chip on the shoulder attitude.Reshuffling of people between arklets seems like a harmless form of rebellion.But its easy to overlook the safety issue that you are pointing out.Which is a mistake.I will say that the confusion as to the real threat level we are under, as long as we As long as we confine ourselves to dirty space, Ravi Kumar threw in.Yes, thank you, Ravi.It just seems that one day we hear one thing, the next day we hear another.Statistics, Tekla said.Yes, that is what we are told again and again, but I can say no more, Tekla offered, and flicked her eyes at one of the small cameras mounted to the hull of the arklet.Julia held her gaze this time, and, after a few moments, threw a glance Spencers way.Tekla, a minute ago we were dancing around the topic of the Situational Awareness Network and Spencer was being a bit lightheartedhis sense of humor at work.But I feel comfortable telling you that, thanks to Spencer, we do have a way to disconnect from the SAN when we want to just have a normal conversation without wondering who might be listening in.And we have done so now.Anything you say here and now will not leave this arklet.Tekla favored the circle of hangers on and admirers with a long, slow panoramic look, then actually rolled her eyes.Everyone out!Julia commanded.You too, Spencer.Just Tekla and me.Your tradecraft is of low quality, Tekla said, when all the others had dispersed through the hamster tubes to the other arklets in Julias heptad.I know, Julia said.It is so difficult rebuilding an intelligence community from scratch.One must make do with the materials at hand.Their youth, their inexperience, and the openness theyve come to expect from living their whole lives on the Internetall are inimical to doing things as they ought to be done.That is why we need more experienced handspeople who have learned the right instincts.It is not just that, Tekla said.That is obvious.Oh?Julia narrowed her eyes.What have I missed that is not so obvious?You should not trust Zeke Petersen with further information, Tekla said.Unless you wish to plant false intelligence, in which case he will be an effective channel.Ivy and Zeke and Tekla had discussed it beforehand, and Zeke had cheerfully volunteered to be given up by Tekla as a supposed turncoat.It made little difference to him personally.And it would go a long way to cementing the idea, in Julias mind, of Tekla as a master double agent.By Cold War standards it was an obvious and amateurish gambit, but this was not the Cold War.This was a small town of fifteen hundred people with a former mayor who was trying to stir up trouble.Julia narrowed her eyes and nodded slowly.She was fascinated.I had wondered about him, she said.He seemed like he was just playing along.Just being polite.Not a problem with Tekla, Tekla said.Julia liked that.She had drifted closer, and now reached out to touch Teklas forearm briefly.I like that about you, Tekla.What I see is what I get.Yes.Then, after a somewhat uneasy silence, Tekla added, You play long game.Patient.To a degree, Julia said, and suddenly her face and attitude had changed, as if her face had been recast in painted steel.We cannot afford to be patient for very long.Markuss death has changed everything.Until that tragic event, the members of the Arkie Community could look forward to the return of the great leader.Ivy was a mere caretaker.Her shortcomings could be overlooked.Now, awareness is spreading through the swarm that Markus is not coming back.Ivy is back in power.Sal will quote from obscure clauses in the Constitution to legitimize her status.But true legitimacy comes from the support of the governed.Shell be moving now to solidify her hold on the reins.Its at such a time that small, symbolic gestures can have the greatest effect.And that, Tekla, is why the next few days are such a critical time for us.Perhaps Ymir will pull through, perhaps not.We cant afford to wait.Preparations are afoot.Three days from now, arklets will begin to break free of the Cloud Ark and begin their epic trek to high orbit.The powers that be might fear to implement the Pure Swarm strategy, for the loss of control it will mean for them.But the Arkie Community, tired of huddling behind an ineffective shield, slowly being decimated by the Hard Rain, knows no such limitations.Survival of the breakaway group will demonstrate the falsity of the GPops predictions of danger, Tekla said, nodding.The power of the center will be broken.For the first time, the Cloud Ark Constitution will truly come into effect, Julia said, notwithstanding the sophistry of the apologist Sal Guodian.That Constitution, Tekla, as Im sure you know, calls for the formation of a security force.Not the Praetorian Guard that Markus cobbled together, but something real.I can think of no one better qualified than you to command it.HOOK, LINE, AND SINKER, SAID SPENCER GRINDSTAFF AS HE AND Julia watched Teklas Flivver depart with a staccato series of thruster burns.Oh, she definitely bought it, Julia admitted, but I dont like the note of triumphalism in your voice, Spencer.What we have really learned is that Ivy is a formidable opponent.Somehow she has managed to get people like Tekla on her side.And they have come up with a fairly elaborate strategy for penetrating our organization.Grindstaff shrugged.As these things go, its not that elaborate.Kind of obvious, really.Easy to say, Julia said, given that you have a bug hidden in the Banana, and we knew everything they were going to do.But lacking that information, Spencer, do you really think wed have seen through it?I thought Tekla did a marvelous job.You need to look out for her.She really hates you.And shes carrying at least one weapon.Thanks to Pete Starling, Julia said, so am I.  She reached into her bag and drew out a small revolver, just far enough that Spencer could see the butt of its grip, then slid it back in.At the risk of insulting your intelligence, Spencer said, I would like to remind you of the consequences of firing that thing inside of a space vehicle.No offense taken.Ive actually seen those consequences.And you know what?The air doesnt leak out that fast.Anyway, Im told that the rounds in this weapon are designed to mushroom on impact, so they are less likely to exit the body.Thats great, Spencer said, provided you actually hit a body.If it comes down to me and Tekla, Julia said, Im not going to miss.ALL DINAH WANTED TO DO WAS SLEEP.SINCE NEW CAIRD HAD DEPARTED from Izzy she had never gotten more than four consecutive hours, and the numbers for the last day or so were even more dismal.In a weird way, she wanted to sleep so that she would be able to grieve properly.She knew Markus was dead, but it hadnt really sunk in.Nor would it, as long as she was running from one crisis to the next.The burn had worked.Ymirs perigee altitude had been raised to the point where it would never again be troubled by the atmosphere.But the ship was still tumbling, albeit slowly.And Vyacheslav was still trudging around on its outer surface with his feet zip tied to Grabbs.At the start of this extravehicular activity, Slava had exited through the airlock on the side of New Cairda ship that was no longer with them.His supplies were running low.He had to get inside the command module before he ran out of air.This could be achieved using an airlock built in for that purpose.It was located adjacent to the docking port in the nose of the ice buried command module.Passing through it, he would enter the uppermost level of the module, where he could breathe the same air as everyone else.But he had taken the precaution of checking himself out with an Eenspektor, and found powerful radiation coming from several locations on his suitbasically, wherever he had come into contact with the surface of the shard.I was worried about this, Jiro said, but there was nothing to be done.Worried about what?Dinah asked.I thought the surface was reasonably clean.It was, Jiro said, until we did the perigee burn.The nozzle was pointed forward.Some of the steam was blown back over us by the windby the atmosphere we were passing through.It condensed and stuck to the surface of the shard.So, now there are little pieces of fallout all over the outside of Ymir.And some of them have gotten stuck to Slavas space suit.Hes got to get out of that thing.Jiro shrugged.The suit will block most of the beta.I mean, hes got to get out of it before he runs out of oxygen.That is true.Which means he has to come in here.Also true.Hes going to bring that radiation inside with him.It will take weeks to kill us.By that time we will have accomplished our mission.Or not.In the end, though, they came up with a workaround that did not involve dying, which was that they taped some plastic over the companionway that joined the command modules top level to the one below it.Before doing so, they moved a generous supply of food and water to that level, along with toiletries, a sleep sack, and other items Vyacheslav would be needing.Slava passed through the airlock with some minutes to spare, doffed his suit, and closed it up in the chamber of the airlock, which would block most of the beta radiation coming off it.He then stripped off his clothes and went through several repetitions of decontaminating himself with premoistened towelettes, throwing all of it into the airlock chamber before slamming its hatch shut.Then he threw up.The upper level of the command module, along with Slava himself, now had to be treated as contaminated, but they didnt need it anymore.Jiro and Dinah would be confined to the lower levels, separated from Vyacheslav and the possible contamination by a sheet of plastic, until they reached Izzy or died.A common air supply circulated through all the levels in ducts, but it had a filter system, which they hoped would catch any floating motes of fallout.Having seen to all of those matters, they turned out the lights and slept.Dinah slept through her alarm, in fact, and finally woke up to realize shed been out for twelve hours.Her next thought was to wonder where Markus was.Then she remembered, with a kind of astonishment, that he was dead.It came as a stinging slap, followed by grief.But on the heels of the grief came a feeling of deep fear that she had rarely experienced in all the time since Zero.It was not the sharp bracing fear one felt on an adventure, such as the ride through perigee, nor the kind of intellectual, abstract fear that had been with them ever since Doob had predicted the Hard Rain.This was a kind of morbid panic that was second cousin to depression.It was how a child might feel upon learning that she had been orphaned.Not a child, rather, but an adolescent, the oldest sibling, on whom responsibility for the family now fell.Markus was gone.He wasnt going to shoulder any more burdens for them.Others would have to take up those burdens.And some of thosethe ones, perhaps, most eager to step into Markuss placewould certainly make the wrong decisions.And so, as sad as Dinah felt about the fact that she would never see Markus again or feel his embrace, the thing that really made her want to contract into a fetal position was this knowledge that it was on her now.On her, and Ivy, and Doob, and the others who could be trusted.She went up into the common room and found Jiro, as usual, lost in contemplation of arcane plots on his computer screen, reflected in miniature on the lenses of his bifocals.During the year he had been in space, his prescription had changed, and so he had been the first consumer of the optical lens grinding machine that had been sent up and installed in Izzy.Without it, much of the Cloud Arks population would gradually have been rendered nonproductive as their eyeglasses were broken or wore out.It was a military machine capable of making glasses in one style, and one style only.At some point a few years down the road, everyone who needed glasses would be wearing this style.It was interesting to contemplate how many decades or centuries would have to go by before the population had grown, and the economy developed, to the point where it could support an eyewear industry with different styles.He looked up at her through the milky reflections.I let you sleep, he said.Your robots seem to be working fine.There is nothing to do until I finish these calculations.And then what?We have to eliminate the last of the tumbling, Jiro said, before we make the final braking burns.For Dinah, that was all clear.Ymir was in a safe orbit now and would not fall into the atmosphere anytime soon.But she was still going much too fast, and way too high, to rendezvous with Izzy.They needed to finish the execution of the same plan theyd had all along, which was to make one or two more braking burns as Ymir passed through her perigee, slowing her down to the point where a rendezvous with Izzy was feasible.This required getting the nozzle pointed forward again, and keeping it that way.How much damage was done to the They were destroyed, Jiro said.We have two remaining.They were both referring to the thruster packages, embedded in the ice, that would normally have been used to manage the shards attitude.It is fine.It was necessary, Jiro added, almost as if worried that Dinah would think poorly of him for criticizing the decisions made by a dead commander.Can more be sent out from Jiro nodded.It is possible to assemble a MIV that could rendezvous with us and assist with the problem.Just in case my idea does not succeed.But since our radio link was lost with New Caird, we cannot coordinate this.And what is your idea?We can use your robots to alter the shape of the nozzle exit, Jiro said.He held up one hand like a blade, pointed toward the ceiling, and then flexed his knuckles slightly, indicating a shallow bend.Make it asymmetrical.Like a scarfed nozzle?Exactly.When we fire the main propulsion it will give us an off axis thrust.If the scarf is oriented correctly, it will have tremendous control authority.Maybe too much, Dinah said.Well end up overcorrecting.One thing at a time, Jiro said.We scarf the nozzle, we do a little correction, we scarf it the other way, we kill the rotation.It might take several repetitions.It can be done.I have been modeling it.Dinah pulled herself into position before her triptych of flat panels, and began opening windows, checking on the activities of her menagerie of robots: some sunning themselves on the outside to soak up power, others sipping juice from the reactors, some mining propellant for the next burn, others mending the nozzle.The latter group, mostly Nats, would be responsible for the nozzle sculpting program.Until now, having an asymmetrical nozzle, delivering thrust at an off angle, had been a problem to be avoided, not a feature to be encouraged.Jiro had emailed her some diagrams of what the nozzle bell would need to look like.The alterations were surprisingly minor.In an engine that produced that much power, a little bit of off axis thrust went a long way.Whens our next perigee?she asked.We just went through one.So, about eight hours from now.THE PARAMOUNT DUTY OF THE CLOUD ARKS COMMANDERSO IMPORTANT that Markus had broken character and described it to Ivy as sacredwas to stay on top of the Bolide Scan, which was a feed of information synthesized out of all of Izzys long range radars and optical telescopes.A disproportionate number of GPop members devoted their lives to managing this, or to maintaining the equipment used to produce it.Because the stream of data was continuous, it needed to be broken down, for the consumption of someone like Markus or Ivy, into reports that showed up on their screens at regular intervals.A Triurnal Bolide Scan was issued at the top of each shift: dot 0, dot 8, and dot 16.Ivy read one of them when she woke up, another in the middle of her afternoon, and the third just before going to sleep.Each of these summarized what was known about bolides that might come near them during the next eight hours, and made recommendations as to what maneuvers the Cloud Ark should execute in order to avoid them.Typically they made small burns several times a day for this purpose.The policy was default go, which meant that the maneuver would be promulgated to the Cloud Ark via Parambulator, and carried out automatically, unless the commander vetoed it.The only reason this was ever likely to happen was in cases where two dangerous rocks were headed their way at about the same time and they needed to make a decision.Such events had occurred twice during the Hard Rain so far, but they had been simulated and war gamed hundreds of times before that.The name of the game was to avoid getting cornered.To be detected eight hours in advance, a bolide had to be pretty big.Smaller ones came along all the time, and werent picked up on the radars until minutes or even seconds before collision.Accordingly, smaller reports were issued at the top of each hour, listing all noteworthy rocks that had been detected during the last sixty minutes.This covered most of them, so the commanderor whoever covered for her while she was sleepingcould discharge most of her responsibilities in re the Bolide Scan by dropping everything else she was doing at the top of each hour and reading it.From time to time, however, they would become aware of a hot rock or streaker that had surprised them by coming in from a weird angle, or at unusually high speed, and then the commander would be notified immediately so that an alert could be issued and evasive action could be seen to.The Streaker Alerts combined elements of the small town midwestern tornado siren with the red alert from Star Trek.All sleeping people were awakened, all nonessential personnel were evacuated from the larger tori, which were considered most vulnerable, and hatches were closed between different sections, in case of a breach.Similar precautions were taken by the Arkies.Arklets were, of course, more vulnerable to bolide strikes, but they were also more maneuverable.As the hot rock drew closer and its orbital parameters were determined more precisely, the data would be fed to Parambulator.Any arklets in danger of being hit would be identified, and a collective solution would be calculated that would enable them to move into safer trajectories without banging into anyone else.These events happened, on average, between one and two times a day, but as always the devil was in the statistical details.They had once gone three days without a single streaker.On another occasion theyd had five of them within a twelve hour period.The first of these events had caused an upwelling of chatter on Spacebook to the effect that the powers that be were overstating the threat in order to cow the Arkies into submission, and the second had generated a hard hitting blog post from Tav Prowse calling the GPop on the carpet for systematic incompetence.It was in the wake of such an alert, while cleaning up her desktop of postaction chatter, that Ivys attention was drawn to a post that had just come up on Tavs blog: an interview with Ulrika Ek.Ulrika has a lot to learn about bloggers was Ivys verdict, after shed finished reading it.She shook her head.Youd think she of all people would knowshes been through PR training.These remarks were delivered to a Banana that had been slowly repopulating itself, during the last few minutes, with people who had been called away on other duties during the Streaker Alert.Tekla was the last to arrive, bringing Tom Van Meter and other members of Markuss security detail in her wake.Luisa and Sal were already present in the room.Doob had just texted his regrets, explaining that he needed to crunch some numbers about what had just happened.She probably dropped her guard, Luisa suggested, thinking she was just chatting informally.Youve read it then?I scanned it.Referring to what?Tekla asked.Ulrika made a few off the cuff remarks about swarm theory, and which strategies we might wish to pursue in the future, and Tav is blowing them up into a cause clbre, Ivy said.What if anything would you like to do about it?Sal asked.Nothing, Ivy said.Look, the longer this thing with Ymir continues, the more anxiety people have about the Big Ride.Every time a hot rock comes in it juices up that anxiety for a little while.Well, either itll work or it wont.If it doesnt work then we have very little choice anywaywe have to Dump and Run.Sal nodded.But if it does work, itll change everything about the way people think.Ivy nodded.Yeah.And I am growingly certain that it will.Even if the scarfed nozzle gambit fails, we still have that MIV we can send out as a backup plan.I think that in a week well have a successful rendezvous with Ymir and well be prepping for the Big Ride.Ivy made a gesture indicating that the new arrivals should find places for themselves around the table.Which brings me to the topic of this meeting, she continued.We know what J. B. F. s plan is.Shes recruiting some number of Arkies willing to strike out on their own.The general scheme seems to be that theyll get a few arklets stocked with provisions for a few weeks journey.Then, on a signal, theyll break away from Izzy and make burns that will take them to a higher orbit.An orbit that we cant reach without expending a lot of propellant.We dont know what their long term plan isor if they even have onebut I think Julia is basically playing the odds that these people will survive long enough to send back messages saying Come on in, the waters fine!and encourage other Arkies to follow suit.They all know that they cant really be pursued once they have departed the swarm.Membership in the Cloud Ark is, under the current state of affairs, voluntary.I infer you mean to change that?Luisa asked drily, casting her gaze over Tekla and the members of the squad.They cant make a break for it without hoarding certain critical supplies, Ivy said.We cant allow people to just ransack our storage facilities for whatever they want.And we have clear evidence that this has been happening.Theres traffic on Spacebook about where to look if you want to score a box of fresh batteries or scrubber cartridges.So, our basic approach to this is going to be simple.Weve identified the worst offenders, where hoarding is concerned.Im going to make an announcement in an hour, explaining how the Cloud Ark Constitution works when it comes to theft of public supplies, and Im going to offer a twenty four hour amnesty during which anyone can turn in stuff that they have been hoarding.As soon as that time is up, Tekla and her team are going to move on one arklet that we know is being used as a storage dump for contraband, and they are going to restore order.And then Sal will step in, as prosecutor, and take whatever action he deems justified.How can you put people in jail when they are already confined to tin cans?Luisa asked.How can you fine them when there is no money?We will have to evolve solutions as we go, Sal said.Tekla stared him down, then drew her thumb across her throat.WELL, THAT SEEMS DEFINITIVE, JULIA SAID.She and Spencer Grindstaff were hovering in the middle of the White Arklet.Drifting near them was a laptop whose speakers had been playing the audio feed from the Banana.They could hear the sounds of the meeting breaking up, and people separating into smaller conversations as they moved out of the room.Spencer pulled it closer and whacked the volume button a few times to mute the sound.As I said before: hook, line, and sinker.Unless, Julia said, they are somehow aware of the fact that we have surveillance on the Banana, and everything we just heard was a sort of radio play staged for our benefit.Spencer beamed.Now, that is paranoid!I thought I had it bad, but Just kidding, Julia said, a little too quickly.This is actionable, Spencer.I believe we are justified in taking everything we just heard at face value.Which means I am comfortable giving good news to the Martians.Are they ready?Yes, theyve been waiting, Spencer said, and thumbed out a text message to summon them.The Martians all had to come via the same hamster tube, so it took a few moments for the core members of the first human expedition to the Red Planet to filter in: Dr.Katherine Quine, whose professional role was obvious; Ravi Kumar, who would be the expeditions commander; Li Jianyu, who would act as a general science officer; and Paul Freel, an American MIV expert, the head engineer.They, as well as a score of other Arkies waiting in the wings, had sworn an oath that theyd not spend the rest of their lives sealed up in tin cans, but would walk on the surface of Mars or die in the attempt.In their wake came several other members of Julias staff.Julia opened the meeting with a few words of greeting and a solemn announcement to the effect that the Mars mission was a go.Once the ensuing round of zero gee high fives and embraces had trailed off into an awkward silence, she singled out Paul Freel.Paul, no doubt youve briefed these others on the very latest while you were so patiently cooling your heels, but might I know what has been going on with the MIV?Of course, Madam President.As you know, theyre trying to stabilize Ymir with A Rube Goldberg scheme in the form of an ice sculpture.Yes, I know about that.Paul chuckled, showing a lot of gum.Not surprisingly, the powers that be are a little nervous about that and so word came down from on high that we ought to be preparing a backup plan, so we can go pull Ymirs fat from the fire if need be.Well.That couldnt be better, from a Martian point of view!As you know, we have been planning this mission for years.After Zero, I kept it going as a side project all through the development of the MIV program, and we managed to grease it in as one of the use cases.Use cases?One of the hypothetical uses to which the MIV kit might eventually be put, Spencer explained.Basically it just gave us an excuse to include a few components, like throttleable landing engines and aeroshield material, that might not have made it in otherwise, Paul went on.So, stabilizing Red Rovers design has been a piece of cake.Red Rover?Yeah, thats what were calling her.I would like to propose something a little more suggestive of a higher purpose, Julia said.Spearhead or some such thing.This led to an uneasy silence terminated by Camila, who said, Ill draw up a list of options and submit it to you right away, Madam President.Thank you, Camila.You understand, Paul, that this mission will have symbolic as well as scientific value, and we want to send the right message to the other Arkies so that they will feel inspired to follow in her wake.Of course!Consider it a working title only, Paul said.A code name.Its not even good as a code name, Spencer pointed out, because anyone can Lets move on, Julia said.You were talking, Paul, about the design.Done.It took, like, a man day.We just had to make a few tweaks to a preexisting use case to reflect the materials and supplies we actually had on hand.Excellent.But a design is not a ship, of course, Paul continued, and until a couple of days ago it wouldve been pretty darn hard to put the actual propulsion system together without bringing down the wrath of Ivy!That is not a phrase calculated to strike fear into the heart of anyone except those most worshipful of her authority, Julia remarked, speaking with the gravity that could only be summoned by one who had recently used nuclear weapons on live targets.Paul cackled.You know what Im saying, thougheverything happens in a fishbowl here!So, you can imagine the grin on my face when we got the order to begin assembling the Ymir rescue MIV.Are the specifications similar?Similar enough.They can both use the same main engine.The thruster packages, the control systems, life supportall of that stuff is completely standardized; it doesnt change from one use case to another, its just a matter of punching different parameters into the code.Its just a config file!Seeing that Julia didnt necessarily know what a config file was, Spencer put in, They can essentially download the DNA, if you will, of Red Rover, or whatever we end up calling it, into the Ymir rescue vehicle with a few keystrokes.Satisfied with that, Julia asked, What of the arklets?The heptad and the triad?Well, theyre already functional, independent space vehicles.Way more than enough space for twenty four Martians and their vitamins.Obviously, weve been stocking up, Paul said, waving his hands around at the bags of food and other supplies crowding the White Arklet.Yes, Julia said, but the critical part of the operation is going to be moving them from their default positions in the swarmwhich will seem unremarkable as far as Parambulator is concernedto the propulsion stack that you have been assembling.And thats going to make a hell of a stink, is it not?The smile on Paul Freels face became a bit frozen.We could just go for it, he said.I have a workaround, said Spencer Grindstaff.I think we can make this happen.A Streaker Alert is all we need.Itll go down tomorrow.How do you know theres going to be a Streaker Alert?Such an event is nothing, Spencer said, other than a particular configuration of bits.DINAH HAD BEEN DREAMING OF MARS.As an asteroid miner, she had never been that interested in the distant and inhospitable Red Planet.The politics of the pre Zero space exploration world had obliged her to show skepticism, even disdain toward those who wanted to go there and to build colonies and terraform the planet.Mars colonists were siphoning attention and resources away from the asteroid miners, who wanted to use easier to get resources to make much more human friendly habitats: space colonies, rotating to provide full gravity, with plenty of water and fresh air.In any event, it had been a dead issue for two years.But that didnt prevent Mars from showing up in her dreams, and now infiltrating her daydreams.Almost three years had now gone by since she had walked on the surface of a planet, looked up into a sky, seen a horizon.Intellectually she knew that death would take her, sooner or later, before she did any of those things again.She and everyone else in the Cloud Ark would live out their lives in environments resembling bomb shelters, hospital basements, and research labs.The best they could hope for was to look out a small window at the starry sky.The view of the blue, green, and white Earth had once provided fascination and solace.The orange ball of fire they now circled was such a disagreeable sight that most people actively avoided looking at it.No one was ever going back there.For those who still aspired to go for a walk before dying of old age, Mars was the only hope, be it ever so impractical.People had been talking about it on Spacebook, and on some of the blogs that had been cropping up on the Cloud Arks miniature Internet.Before the loss of New Caird had severed Ymirs data link to the Cloud Ark, some of it had trickled through to her tablet, and Dinah read it in idle moments.At least she had some idle moments now.Since the decision to try the scarfed nozzle approach, they had executed two burns, about twenty four hours apart, each with a slightly different configuration of the ice nozzle: a canted lip, constructed by the Nat swarm, projecting almost imperceptibly above the aft surface of the shard and bending the torrent of steam slightly.The first of those burns had gotten them spinning the way they wanted to go, though spinning might be too strong a word for a rotation that took the better part of a day.During that day the Nats had decamped to the other side of the nozzles rim and built a lip there.The second burn, then, had stopped the rotation that the first one had started, and brought them close enough to their desired attitude that the surviving thrusters could handle the details.Another perigee was coming up soon.This time the nozzle would be aimed the way they wanted itforward, once again turning the nuclear engine into a powerful retro rocket.The robots on the inside of the shard had been at work scooping it out, sculpting the walnut shell architecture that, according to the structural engineering simulations, would enable the whole thing to hold together during the last round of maneuvers.The hoppers were full of ice, with more on the way, and theyd finally learned how to make the system work consistently.Part of that lesson was not to try to accomplish too much with any one burn.It was better to take it easy, set a reasonable delta vee target, get it done and lock it down, then take stock of the situation and plan the next burn at leisure.Consequently their rendezvous with Izzy looked to be happening much later than theyd first expected, and almost every day brought a further postponement.But at the same time it came to seem more and more of a sure thing, less of a wild chance, and this began to affect Dinahs thinking.Her robots were doing their work almost entirely on autopilot, leaving her somewhat bored.Vyacheslav, sealed up on the other side of a wall of plastic, could be talked to, but preferred keeping to himself.Jiro, on the other hand, had been working almost around the clock and had been showing signs of strain.Dinah would find excuses to float behind him and look over his shoulder at his screen.Was he playing solitaire?Running orbital mechanics simulations?Writing his memoirs?He seemed mostly to be looking at video feeds of machinery.By process of elimination, this had to be near the core of the reactor.In the floor of the bottom most level, three stories below them, was a manhole giving way to a shaft sunk into the ice.At the far end of that shaft was another hatch providing access to what, on an oceangoing ship of Old Earth, would have been called the boiler room.A small pressurized compartment housed control panels and access ports connected to the reactor, which was only a few meters away, on the other side of a heavy wall.The wall was a radiation shield, at least in theory.But sending up a huge piece of lead hadnt been an option for the hastily assembled Ymir expedition, and so the boiler room got washed with neutrons and gamma rays whenever the reactor was used.The radiation detectors that Sean and company had left behind, the last time theyd closed that hatch, didnt leave much to the imagination.The place was a hellhole now.Fortunately, all the systems connected there had been designed to be operated remotely, from the safety of the command module, so there was no need to go down that ice tunnel and open that hatch.Their instruments told them they were nearing perigee again.Jiro, assisted by Dinah, executed what they hoped would be the second to last burn of the big engine.This went on longer than Jiro had predicted, but it seemed to work.Ymir shed most of her excess velocity.Her orbit, at apogee, was now only a few hundred kilometers higher than Izzys.In spite of attrition suffered by the robots as they wore out, broke, or succumbed to radiation damage, Dinah still had enough of them to restock the hoppers for the final major burn, which they calculated would be happening at a perigee a few hours later.If you are satisfied with the disposition of your robots, Jiro said, I would like to show you how to operate the main propulsion.She had grown up in mining camps where older men liked to amuse her, and themselves, by teaching her how to operate heavy machinery, blow things up with dynamite, pilot airplanes, and the like.So Jiros offer didnt seem unusual to her, at first.Teaching people how to do stuff was, among other things, a way to alleviate boredom.But over the course of the next hour it slowly became clear to her that Jiro really was expecting her to operate the engine during the upcoming burn.It might have been the language barrier; but his English was pretty good, and he was being quite persistent in saying things like you will keep an eye on this thermocouple and you might see some flutter in this valve.If you dont hear from me beyond the thirty second mark, he said at one point, then you are on your own and you will have to initiate shutdown based on observed delta vee.Why would I not hear from you?Dinah asked.Where are you going to be?In the boiler room, Jiro said.Why would you go there?Some of the control blade actuators have stopped responding, he said.I think that the electronics have been damaged by radiation.Its okay.We have replacements.But they will have to be installed manually.So youre going to go down there?Yes, Jiro said.And that is where I am going to stay.IT IS FOR ALL PURPOSES EMPTY, TEKLA REPORTED OVER AN ENCRYPTED voice link to Ivy.Empty of people.Empty of supplies.She, Tom Van Meter, and Bolor Erdene had spent the last ten minutes searching Arklet 98 from front door to boiler room, under the eye of Sal Guodian.They had arrived via Flivver, docked, and entered 98 without incident.Sal had gone through first, carrying a tablet on which was displayed the first search warrant ever issued under the provisions of the Cloud Ark Constitution.He had been ready to show it to the first person who challenged him.But no one was here.Tekla, Tom, and Bo had then come in, wearing orange vests improvised from survival kits that, since theyd been designed for use on Earth, had no practical utility anymore.These would serve as police uniforms until something else could be stitched together.With any luck, they wouldnt be needing a lot of cop gear.But Ivy had been clear, and the others in her ad hoc council had agreed, that if they were executing what amounted to a police action, they couldnt beat around the bushcouldnt try to palm it off as an informal visit.A new constitution had to be exercised, or it was just words.Can you get it back on the SAN?Ivy asked, over the voice link.Id like to see whats happening.Ill reboot everything, Sal said, pulling himself up into the control couch.But it depends on what Spencer didwhether he broke it permanently, or just entered a temporary command.He reached around in back of a panel, felt for a connector, pulled it out, and jacked it back in.We had estimated that you were going to find ten person years worth of nonrenewables in that thing, Ivy said.She meant, not bulk food (which could be grown in the outer hull space of an arklet) or air (which was renewed by the life support system), but generally smaller items like toiletries, vitamins, medicine, and specialty food.That was based on circumstantial evidencethe amount of stuff thats gone missing, the number of Flivver trips and EVAs that have touched that arklet.We always knew it was only a guess.But for it to contain nothing at all is ...odd.More than odd, Tekla said.Surprise attack.You think theres going to be an attack?Maybe not in sense of violent assault, Tekla said, but something.And Arklet 98 was a decoy?Obviously.A musical tone sounded from the arklets PA speakers, and the white LEDs changed their hue to red.Alert, said a synthesized voice.All personnel should now be awake and at stations for urgent swarm maneuver.This is not a drill.Theyd heard it before.It was a Streaker Alert.Normally, though, they took it at face value.Remarkable coincidence, Tekla said.I think you guys had better get back in the Flivver, Ivy said.Follow the usual procedures for one of these, but keep your eyes open.STEVE, DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING YET ON THE BOLIDE?IVY ASKED.They were about five minutes into the alert, which had obliged them to move down into the Banana.As much as Ivy wanted to know what was happening with J. B. F. , and what Tekla had characterized as a surprise attack, her responsibility in a case like this one was clear: all of her attentions had to be focused on the evasive maneuvers being carried out by the Cloud Ark and their possible consequences.Those might include collisions between arklets or the separation of one or more arklets from the swarm.In dire cases it might be necessary to send out rescue teams, which was why her first act had been to get Tekla and the others into their Flivver.For the normal role of that makeshift police service was not to serve warrants on hoarders; it was to respond to emergencies.As keenly as the space geek in Ivys soul wanted to pay attention to the scientific phenomenon of the incoming rock, it was a task she had to delegate; and shed delegated it to Steve Lake as soon as the alert had sounded.Thus far, the alert had been proceeding as most of them did, which meant that most network activity had been shut down to leave open bandwidth for Parambulator.That system swung into action without human intervention, calculating courses, making suggestions, and gathering data about what the motes in the data cloud were doing.The Parambulator screens were looking pretty angry, but that was normal as almost every arklet fired its thrusters and shunted into a new trajectory.In time it would get sorted out.It always did.But part of the sorting out process was refining what they knew about the trajectory of the incoming streaker.The closer it came, the more precisely they could track it.By the time it passed through, or near, the swarm, theyd have its parameters dialed in to high precision.And once it had flashed by, all Parambulator had to do was clean up the mess.Ivy had asked Steve about the bolide for a couple of reasons.One was that hot rocks, by definition, tended to come and go rapidly.This one had been approaching for several minutesa long time to wait.Another was that Parambulator looked more chaotic than usual.Normally there would be a spray of red in the first couple of minutes.Presently it would begin to fade as the arklets reported that they were out of harms way.But in this case, it never seemed to get any better.Are we having trouble with bandwidth, or The rock is weird, Steve said.Normally Id expect to see a stream of packets from SI, refining the params as they gathered more data.He meant Sensor Integration: the department that managed the radars and telescopes.And youre not?Well, I ambut with different numbers.What do you mean, different numbers?Its like we have two different Streaker Alerts happening at once.The packets are stepping on each other.Theres some kind of crosstalk going on.Steve sat back from his screen for a moment and tugged his beard.Just a sec, he said.I think that these packets are coming from different sources.But they should all have the same point of origination, Ivy said.SI.They claim to, Steve said, but I think that some of them are forgeries.Feeling his chair shift subtly beneath him, he reached out involuntarily with one hand and held the edge of the table.Izzy was firing her thrusters, coming about to a new orientation, trying to put Amalthea between herself and the bolidereal or imagined.You think this whole alert is them spoofing us?It would fit in with Teklas theory of whats going on, Steve said.Ill try to voice with Doob, Ivy said.Work on that forgery hypothesis.MADAM PRESIDENT, CAMILA SAID, PULLING A HEADPHONE AWAY from her ear.As you requested, I am informing you that Ivy has figured it out.She knows?Julia asked.Not quite, but Steve Lake has detected the forged packets and is running further analysis.Camilas eyes were big and her voicewhich was always somewhat impaired by her facial injurieswas thick and dry.Julia threw her a shrewd look, then turned to Spencer Grindstaff, who shrugged.Sooner or later a man of Steves talents was bound to I dont care about that, Julia cut in.I want to know whether our gambit has bought us enough time.Theres Camila began.Spencer ran Camila off the road.It has bought us enough confusion.We should be in a position to dock this heptad at the Shipyard in twenty seconds.Theres another bolide!Camila squeaked.I think.Julia shook her off, keeping her focus on Spencer.Where is the triad?Already there, Spencer said.The spacewalkers?Suited up, out of the airlocks, in position.Still.The assembly.The integration.It will take time.Madam President, if I may, Paul Freel broke in.All we need is to slap her togetherwith zip ties, if thats what it takesand achieve separation from the Shipyard.A small thruster burn will do it.Izzy doesnt have phasers to blast us out of the sky!They could send a Flivver after us, but what are they going to do?All we need is to get clear.Then we can spend days prepping Red Hope before we embark on the mission in earnest.I wouldnt put anything past that Tekla.Say what you will about her, shell follow orders, Paul said.Well, as a stay behind supporter of your expedition, I will be happy to run interference for you until you can get cleanly away, Julia said.Through the heptads structure, a programmed series of whirrs and clunks resonated as it docked with a port on the long truss projecting to the side of the Caboose: the heart of the Shipyard, rich in airlocks and anchoring points.Docked at the next port along was a glinting, angular framework: the skeleton of Red Hope, awaiting its final components.It sported four large propellant tanks clustered around a knot of pumps, valves, actuators, and sensors that fed a rocket engine centered below.Madam President?Ravi asked.Im afraid the time is now.Unless you want to go to Mars.Which you would be welcome to do.Julia snapped to attention.She had been checking herself in the mirror of her compact.Hardly glamorous, but by Cloud Ark standards, her appearance would do.It is tempting, Julia said, but I have responsibilities here, Im afraid.She snapped the compact shut and glanced over, verifying that Camila was ready to shoot video on her phone.She was, but she still had that rattled look on her face.What had come over her?Theyd have to have a heart to heart later.Very well, Ravi said, with a note of regret that sounded only a little forced.Perhaps youll be wanting this.He held out a sheet of paper.Taking it from him, Julia recognized it as the presidential seal, much the worse for wear.Ravi had carefully peeled it from the wall, bringing most of its rectangle of blue tape with it.Julia smoothed it out and tucked it under one arm.Slowly drifting away from her, Ravi snapped out a salute.Julia returned it.Godspeed, Ravi.I look forward to hearing your first transmission from the surface of Mars.And I look forward to sending it, Madam President.We shall meet again, I feel.Somehow the intrepid people of the Cloud Ark will find a way, in spite of all opposition, to win through to the realm of clean space and follow Red Hope to a better place.Ravi was one of those who could never quite tell when he was dismissed.He began to mumble out a stirring response, but Julia glanced at Camila to let her know that she could stop recording, then propelled herself toward the nose of the White Arklet.Camila followed in her wake.After a few moments of squirming through tubes, they emerged from the port into one of the modules that made up the Shipyard.It was something of a madhouse.The total roster of the Red Hope expedition was two dozen.Most of those were already aboard the heptad or the triad, waiting to be mated with the vehicles frame, but a few were outside in space suits and several were in here, engaging in hasty conferences or shoving bundles of supplies about.Adding a bizarre note were four members of the General Populationapparently Shipyard workerswho had been zip tied, hands behind backs, to convenient attachment points around the inside of the module.Most looked fine, but one man had a stream of small blood globules drifting away from a laceration on his eyebrow.Paul Freel had mentioned in passing that several of the MIV team had become unwitting accomplices, helping to assemble the frame of Red Hope on the understanding that it was part of a backup plan to rescue Ymir.Apparently they had changed status to witting, and raised objections.The bleeding man was staring at Julia through the eye that hadnt swollen shut.Julia!he called out.In an odd way Julia had nothing to do.The other Martians were busy shoving their hoarded supplies through the port into the heptad.One by one the Martians were following suit, and so the space was rapidly clearing out.She ignored the bleeding man at first.But it got to the point where only one MartianPaul Freel himselfwas remaining.Lacking Ravis feel for ceremony, he was checking off items on the screen of his tablet, paying Julia no attention whatsoever.Julia!the zip tied man said again.He wasnt shouting.His tone was almost conversational.Yes, she finally said.Whats your friends name?he asked, nodding toward Camila.Julia bridled for a moment at the impertinent request, then remembered that it was never too late to turn an enemy into a friend.Her name is Camila, she said.And let me say, sir, that I am shocked and dismayed to see what has occurred to you.Let me assure you that Hey, Camila!the man said.Yes?Camila answered, sounding very much the scared eighteen year old girl.Your friend is crazy, the man told her.Madam President?Paul asked, before Julia had time to react.She turned toward Paul, her face burning.If you would do the honors?What honors?Honestly, these engineers.Was she supposed to break a bottle of champagne over it?Close the hatch when I have gone through.Then we can undock.Happy to.See you on Mars.He stuck his hand out.She grasped it lightly and gave it a little shake.Camila, rattled by the exchange with the bleeding man, had forsaken her duties as camera operator.Paul Freel reached into the portal joining Earth to Mars, pulled himself through, turned about, and closed the hatch on his side.Julia followed suit on hers.Immediately she felt, as much as heard, the hisses and clunks that signaled the undocking of Red Hope.Unfamiliar noises radiated through the modules hull too, very close to her, and she realized that these were the boots of space suits moving around.The alert is canceled, announced a synthetic voice.The color of the lights changed.Camila emitted a short, explosive scream.Then she pointed down the length of the Shipyard, toward where it connected with the Stack.Down in the Caboose, some thirty meters away, a few people could be seen, dressed in orange vests.One of them looked directly at her.It was Tekla.The synthesized voice spoke out again, sounding a second alert.That wasnt part of the plan.Tekla must have gathered her legs against something down in the Caboose capable of pushing back, because all of a sudden she was flying toward them like a rocket.Her arms were in motion, reaching this way and that to slap at anything that could help her correct her course, but her eyes were fixed on Julia and she was coming straight for her.Something gleamed in her hand, a thin arc of silver light: the honed edge of a dagger.A crisp metallic noise resounded through the module as Julia pulled back the hammer on Pete Starlings revolver.Gun!shouted the bleeding man.Gun!Gun!If Tekla heard, she did not care, but only pushed back harder against a strut in the neighboring module and came on faster.To Julia the weapons recoil came too soon, as if it had gone off accidentally.Shed been in space long enough to know that it would knock her back, and it did; but she also saw things she could not explain.Camila had entered the picture, flying in from the side with an arm outstretched.The wall of the Shipyard itself reached out to body check Tekla.A moment later it struck Camila, then Julia.She had expected the high pitched hiss of a bullet sized hull puncture; but what followed was more like a roar.Like the crowd in a football stadium when a pass is intercepted.Camilas arm had turned into a wing of fire.Something took Julia from behind and hurled her toward the Caboose.She looked around, thinking, crazily, that the bleeding man had somehow gotten loose and tackled her.But the force pushing her along was no human being.It was a torrent of escaping air.JIRO, CAN YOU HEAR ME?DINAH ASKED FOR THE FOURTH TIME.She conjectured that he could, but that he was simply too weak to answer.So she went ahead and delivered the good news.We made it, she said.I have Izzy on optical.Well converge with them in about half an hour.Good, he said, good.She was startled to hear anything at all.But the second good was a lot fainter than the first one, and she reckoned it was all he could get out.She decided not to tell him anything further.Entombed in Ymirs boiler room, simultaneously freezing to death while being cooked alive by radiation, he didnt need to hear a description of what Dinah was seeing through the telescope.They had been calling this the Cloud Ark for two years.The name had been meant somewhat poetically.Today, however, it really did look like a cloud.Her view of Izzy, which usually was so crisp and sharp in the high contrast light of outer space, was cloaked in a glinting and winking shroud of what might be clinically described as particulate matter.It went without saying that Izzy had taken a direct hit from a bolide.Beyond that, it was difficult to make out details.Ymirs final burnfor Jiro, a suicide missionhad settled her in an orbit quite similar to Izzys: the same plane, the same average altitude.The only difference was that it was a little bit more oval, calculated to cross Izzys path twice during each revolution around the Earth.They were approaching one of those crossings, and so from Dinahs point of view the space station kept getting closer, filling the window on her computer screen, obliging her to zoom out, giving her a progressively sharper, more detailed picture.As minutes ticked by, she was able to piece together a guess as to what had happened.The rock must have come in from an angle, missed Amalthea cleanly, and struck somewhere near H2, the hub that anchored Tori 2 and 3.Both of the tori had huge bites taken out of them, and both had stopped rotating.Aft of that point, Izzys spineher central Stackwas actually bent.The spreading wings of the Shipyard were still attached to the Caboose, but they were askew, and leaking debris.The original torusthe one that contained the Bananawas still rotating, and looked whole, but as she drew closer she saw it had taken damage, perhaps from shrapnel.A faint thud resounded through the ice hull.Theyd probably struck a piece of jetsam.No matter, it wouldnt be moving very fast.Ymir could nuzzle her way through a cloud of that stuff and never feel it.One of the windows on her screen flashed up a video feed, triggered by the motion detector on a Grabbs camera, and she saw a human body drifting away into space.She swallowed against a sharp contraction of her throat.Part of her wondered if she would find Izzy a ghost shipif she were the only human remaining alive.For Vyacheslav had stopped communicating with them yesterday.Before then, he had mentioned that he had been suffering from diarrhea.If this was caused by radiation exposure, it was a death sentence.He might simply have committed suicide rather than wait for the inevitable.Alone at the controls of Ymir, she coasted toward Izzy, silent and adrift in the cosmos, and entertained the thought, just for a while, that she might be the only human being left in the universe.Then a red lighta laser, aimed right at herbegan to flash from the Mining Colony, and her mind began to pick out Morse code.SENDING FLIVVERS TO EFFECT FINAL MANEUVERS DISREGARD STRAY ARKLETS WELCOME HOME Lacking any way to respond, she waited, and watched.Shreds of insulation, scraps of structural material, spilled vitamins, and the occasional body tumbled across the window as she panned and zoomed over various details.Everything forward of Zvezda looked pretty good.The Mining Colony and Moiras stash of genetic equipment appeared to be unscathed.Good.Three Flivvers had separated themselves from the cloud and established trajectories that would bring them to Ymir within a few minutes.She guessed that they would act as tugboats, butting their heads against the shard and using their main engines to effect the final delta vee needed to achieve rendezvous.So, the first part of the transmission made sense.DISREGARD STRAY ARKLETS, however, was something of a mystery.Why would there be such a thing?And what did it mean, anyway, for an arklet to be stray?And yet as Dinah panned the telescope across the arc of space forward and aft of Izzythe realm where most of the arklets normally parked themselvesshe found it curiously underpopulated.It was just a general visual impression.She couldnt verify it scientifically without access to a Parambulator screen.It occurred to her, then, that all she needed to do was switch on her tablets connection to the mesh network.Shortly after New Cairds departure from Izzy, she had turned it off because, once they got out of range, it was a useless battery drainer.And indeed the tablet soon brought up the little icon announcing it had found a connection, perhaps relayed through one of those Flivvers.A minute or two went by as the device downloaded all of the email and message traffic that had been piling up in her inbox during her vacation.She passed the time playing with the telescope.A detail caught her eye as she panned across the scene, and she went back and zoomed in on it for a closer look.It was a MIV, an unusually big one.Basically a five layer stack, wasp waisted.The bottom layer was an engine of the most powerful class in the MIV toolkit.Above that was a fat cluster of propellant tanks.The third layerthe narrow waistwas a single arklet with an airlock on its sidea command module, she guessed, similar to New Cairds.Above that was a triad, and on top, forming the fat head of the vehicle, was a heptad.All of it was shrouded in structural webbing.Snared like little bugs in the edges of that web were small modules that she recognized as attitude control thrusters.The most notable thing about the vehicle was her outsized propellant tanks, hinting at a long journeyto where?The thing was keeping station several kilometers forward of Izzy, in a region that had been largely denuded of arklets.Her tablet finally finished downloading messages, most of which were long out of date by this point.She sorted them by age, newest first, and scanned the headings.Very few had come through in the last several hours.That stood to reason, given that the Cloud Ark had other things on its mind.But close to the top was one that caught her eye: OPEN COMMUNIQU FROM PRESIDENT JBF TO THE PEOPLE OF THE CLOUD ARK.Merely seeing those words gave her a feeling as if shed been socked in the solar plexus.She tapped it anyway, and read it: Todays shocking tragedy has left us all bereaved, and seeking answers.I was in a Shipyard module when it happened, having just bid farewell and godspeed to the brave explorers of the Red Hope expedition.Thanks to the automatic closure of a hatch, I experienced only minor injuries and discomfort from partial decompression.As we all know, many members of the General Population were not so lucky.I join with all humanity in mourning their sacrifice.By its nature, the Arkie Community was less affected by this disaster.As I had envisioned from the very beginnings of the Cloud Ark project, the distributed architecture of the swarm prevented serious damage.We did lose three arklets, I am sorry to say, and several more sustained damage from minor collisions or debris impacts.But overall the system worked as we had planned from the beginning.Many members of the AC are now, quite naturally, asking themselves whether it is safe to remain in low Earth orbit, clustered around a heavy, aging space station that lacks the ability to maneuver out of harms way.The open vista of clean space beckons above us.Red Hope will soon fire its main engine and begin its trek across that unexplored frontier to a planet that will one day have room for us all.The Cloud Ark cannot follow heryet.But as all members of the AC know, having gone through extensive training in space operations and orbital mechanics, it is well within the capability of any arklet to raise its orbit substantially by making use of its engines and its onboard propellant supplies.Alone, a single arklet, triad, or heptad will not long endure.As part of a swarm, however, it has a fighting chance.Many members of the Arkie Community who have been watching the desperate trials and tribulations of the Ymir expedition, and who have now witnessed the damage inflicted upon Izzy by a single bolide, are now asking themselves whether it is safe to remain, and to trust themselves to the agonizingly slow climb toward clean space envisioned by the partisans of the Big Ride faction.I am a politician, not a scientist, and so I cannot pretend to render a technical opinion.Some may question whether I should be making a public announcement at all.The simple fact of the matter is that my past career as President of the United States has given me prominence in the Arkie Community, whether or not I deserve it.Many have been asking me what I shall do now.Rather than wait for rumor to sow confusion, I am therefore issuing this communiqu.For what it is worth, I have, with the assistance of some loyal friends, escaped from the wreckage of Izzy and found safe haven aboard Arklet 37, currently part of a triad.Shortly after I transmit this message, we will initiate a burn of our main propulsion that will lift us clear of the drifting debris that surrounds what once was the International Space Station, and move us in the direction of clean space.Our orbital parameters will be posted openly on the network so that like minded members of the AC may join us in creating a swarm based solution to the acute problems currently imposing themselves on the human race.From a safe position in higher orbit, we will look for ways to extend a helping hand to our surviving friends marooned in the General Population.Working together as a community, we will preserve what we have and build a stable way of life in the sky as we await with breathless anticipation the results of Red Hopes inspiring venture to the welcoming surface of Mars.Shes right about the breathless part of it, Dinah muttered to herself, closing the window and looking at the time stamp again.It had been transmitted three hours ago.Then, only half an hour ago, Ivy had responded with a counter communiqu.Dinah didnt read it, but based on the subject heading she knew what it would say: dont listen to J. B. F. , stay in formation, we need you and you need us.But from what Dinah was seeing, both through the optical telescope and on Parambulator, Ivys message had come too late to forestall the departure of a large number of arklets.Somewhere out there, up above them in higher orbit, a new swarm was taking shape, running its own, independent instance of Parambulator, and looking to J. B. F.  for leadership.Dinah had been through many emotional ups and downs while retrieving Ymir.More downs than ups, of course, given the fatality rate.In a strange way, however, the emotional high point was just a few moments ago when she had scanned the word desperate in J. B. F. s communiqu.She rather liked being described as desperate, particularly when she was just on the verge of succeeding.Parambulator was working on her screen now.She used it to check the status of those three Flivvers.They were still closing.Messages were starting to come in from their pilots, trying to make out whether anyone was still alive in the shard, whether it was safe to approach.Dinah texted back: One survivor.Stand clear for a sec while this thing takes a big glow in the dark crap.Then she pulled up the window she used to communicate with her network of robots and typed in a single word command: JETTISON.It was the name of a program that Sean had started, Larz had improved, and Dinah had recently finished.It was a program meant to be run simultaneously by every robot in the shard, as well as some other systems down in the boiler room.A prompt came back: ARE YOU SURE Y/N Y, she typed.CONGRATULATIONS!!!came back.The dead crew of Ymir had sent her a message from the void.She pushed herself over to the companionway, got her head aimed down through the hole in the floor, and pulled herself straight to the bottom level of the command module.The hatch in the floorthe one that led to the ice tunnel that terminated in the boiler roomhad already been closed, as a basic safety measure.But Dinah verified that one last time and made sure it was sealed.Because in a few seconds, there would be nothing but vacuum on the other side of it.Ymir had begun grumbling.Dinah felt as if she were trapped inside the belly of a frost giant with indigestion.What she was hearing, she knew, was the collective noise made by thousands of Nats, and hundreds of larger robots, as they moved to safe positions on the inner surface of the hollow shard and gnawed away at the structural webbing that connected it to the reactor core.She returned to her seat in the command module and pulled up a video feed from the interior of the shard.Its walls were now thin enough to admit some sunlight, and so it had become a sort of vast pellucid amphitheater where all of those robots could look inward to the smooth beryllium poda neutron reflecting shroudsurrounding the reactor core.Formerly this had been buried in ice; the recent excavations made to fuel the big perigee burns had left it exposed, also revealing the smaller pod of the boiler room mounted on its side, and the system of hoppers and augers that fed it.Aft of that was what remained of the ice cavern of the nozzle bell, now mostly melted away to expose the blackness of space beyond.The only thing now holding the reactor chamber in place was the massive central thrust pillar, a tree trunk of ice that grew from its forward end and extended straight up to the solid nose of the shard, where the command module was embedded.JETTISON did her the courtesy of showing a countdown on the screen, so that she could plug her ears.When it hit zero, a sickening crack resounded through the whole structure.The video feed showed a brilliant spray of ice blown free from the central pillar, just above where it connected to the reactor vessel.Demolition charges, placed there long ago by Seans crew, had detonated and severed the connection.For a moment she feared nothing further would happen, but then jets of white steam lanced from the reactor vessels rounded top.JETTISON had opened valves, releasing pressure that had built up in the chamber from the reactors residual heat, and those valves were now acting as makeshift rocket engines, pushing the whole reactor, and everything attached to it, down toward the vacancy of the nozzle.The entire reactor chamber dropped out the bottom of the shard and was gone.If JETTISON continued to do its work, the reactor, now a free floating vehicle, all brawn and no brains, would execute a few clumsy maneuvers to kill its own orbital velocity and drop itself into the atmosphere.Bye, Jiro, Dinah said.Thank you.One of the Flivver pilots texted her: Wow.Dinah gave it all one more thorough scan, using several cameras.But there wasnt much to see.Ymir was now a hollow, sugarloaf shaped shell, crawling with robots, and helplessly adrift in space.She texted, Did someone place an order for a megaton of propellant?INSTINCT HAD HERDED THEM TOGETHER IN THE SCRUM, CLOSE TO Amalthea and far away from the parts of Izzy that had been damaged or destroyed.That was where Dinah found them, after shed been brought aboard, scrubbed clean, checked and checked again for contamination.Pink and raw, she embraced Ivy first, for a long time, and then made the rounds to Doob, Moira, Rhys, Luisa, Steve Lake, Fyodor, and Bo.Konrad Barth and many others were dead.Tekla was still in surgery.One of her breasts had been damaged by a fragment and was being surgically repaired.Curled up in very nearly a fetal position at one end of the SCRUM was a woman who was quietly weeping.She hid her face from the room with an arm swathed, from fingertips to shoulder, in white gauze.Dinah recognized her as Camila, Julias sidekick.Ivy insisted that they all move back down the Stack and meet in the Banana.It took some gentle persuasion to get Camila to come with them, but eventually Luisa talked her into it.Out of habit she kept reaching for the veil she normally drew across the lower half of her face, but it wasnt there anymore.She was dressed like everyone else, in a shapeless coverall.What is Camila doing here?Dinah asked Moira, as they maneuvered down the Stack.Moira had obviously been crying and seemed badly shaken up.She and Tekla had become a couple at some point, and Moira was taking the news of her partners injury hard.Tekla came for J. B. F. , Moira said, and J. B. F.  tried to shoot her.Camila reached out and grabbed for the gun, I guess.She was always wearing that gauzy wrap, as a veil.The fabric caught fire from the flash of the gun, and burned her arm before she could get it off.But she saved Tekla?Who knows?The bullet struck something else and fragmented, apparently.The holes where shrapnel had struck T1the first, oldest, and smallest torushad been patched, and it had been repressurized.They had always considered it a safe place before; they needed to begin thinking of it in that light again, which was why Ivy had insisted they come here.They took seats in the Banana.The numbers had come in.Ivy opened the meeting by reciting them.At the onset of the Hard Rain, the human populationnot counting any who might still be alive on Earthhad been 1,551, or 1,553 if you counted the two late arrivals, Julia and Pete Starling.Starling hadnt even made it out of his space capsule, so the initial number had been 1,552.At the same time there had been 305 occupied, free flying arklets plus 11 spares that were attached to Izzy but not occupied.The free flying ones had housed 1,364 people; the remaining 188 humans had lived aboard Izzy as members of the General Population.But at any given time, 10 percent of the Arkies had been rotating through Izzy, bringing its population on a typical day up to 324.Prior to todays disaster, 26 people had been killed in various mishaps, mostly smaller bolide strikes.Another 24 were now aboard the stolen MIV calling itself Red Hope, and if their claims were taken at face value, they would soon be en route to Mars.Of the persons who had been aboard Izzy at the time of the disaster, 211 had been killed outright and another two dozen or so remained in critical condition.The number of living people aboard Izzy had therefore been reduced to 113.The General Populationthe older, more experienced, highly trained specialistshad been reduced from 188 to 106.At the moment of the disaster, 1,178 persons had been living in arklets.The distributed nature of the swarm, combined with the fact that many arklets had flown the coop with Julia, made it difficult to estimate casualties.The best estimate they currently had was that seventeen arklets had fallen victim, with assumed 100 percent loss of life, reducing that population to about 1,100.If that was correct, then the days full death toll had been close to 300.In terms of arklet count, theyd started the day with 299 surviving, occupied arklets, a figure that had been reduced to 282 by the collision.Ten of thema heptad and a triadwere attached to Red Hope, leaving 272.Approximately 200 were missing and presumed to have flown the coop with J. B. F.  The remaining 70 or so had elected to stay behind and were still reporting in as members in good standing of the Cloud Ark.The 11 spares were still attached to Izzy and would be inspected for damage later.The arklets still with them probably had a population of some 300.That plus the survivors aboard Izzy added up to a bit over 400.The population of J. B. F. s breakaway swarm must then be something like 800 souls.She had taken two thirds of the human race with her.God forgive me, Doob said, but right now I dont even care about head count.The number Im after is engines.Arklet engines.Until Dinah showed up with all of that ice, they were useless.Now, we have a way to fuel them.If we get them all pointed in the same direction, all pushing on Izzy, we can go on the Big Ride.He paused to look at his notes.With his reading glasses down on his nose he suddenly looked a lot older to Dinah.She could only imagine how she looked.Based on what you just told me, am I right in thinking we have About seventy, Ivy said, plus the eleven spares.We havent checked those yet, but on visual inspection they seem undamaged.Eighty one, Doob said.I like that number.A perfect square.A perfect square of perfect squares, Rhys put in.If we could come up with a structural system for ganging them in clusters of ninejust a three by three grid, with shared propellant feedsand make nine of those clusters, and integrate them into Izzys structure somehowthat being the hard partthen wed have an array of eighty one engines.If those things all come on at full power when we pass through perigee, itll give us enough combined thrust to make a difference.I think we can make the Big Ride work with that level of power.Its a lot of structure, Fyodor pointed out.A lot, a lot, a lot.We have a lot of raw materials to work with, dont we?Luisa asked.Ive seen rolls and rolls of that aluminum ribbon for feeding into the extruder machines.It is a question of time, Fyodor said.Yes, we have a lot of material.But to assemble it with so few people is difficult.Atmosphere is growing, drag is increasing, orbit is decaying.Dinah looked across the table at Rhys.Rhys the biomimetic engineer, the man who had perhaps saved Ymir with his idea of turning robots into little, radiation resistant Ben Grimms.Well build it out of ice, Dinah said.Rhys looked up at her, pondered it for a second, and nodded.Too brittle, Fyodor said.I dont think Dinahs speaking of regular ice, Rhys said.She means the pykrete stuff they used on Ymir.Fiber reinforced ice.It worked to hold the shard together.We can make it work here.Moira spoke up.Perhaps Im missing something, but I was under the impression that the ice was our propellant.Arent we going to melt it, and consume it, as we go along?Yes, Doob said.And doesnt that mean that well be consuming the structure thats holding everything together?Yes, Doob repeated, but its okay.Because the more of it we use, the lighter we get, and the less thrust we need.So its okay to sacrifice some structure as we go along.Sal had been listening intently.I dont mean to throw cold water on the idea, he said.The punassuming he meant it as suchelicited a few groans.But weve been hearing about radioactive contamination.On the outer surface of the shard, yes, Dinah said.Microscopic motes of stuff that is super radioactive, stuck to the ice.Beta wont penetrate our living spaces.Well have to be careful, though, not to track it inside.We can program robots to crawl around, look for those hot motes, and get rid of them over time.Sal looked unconvinced.I wont lie to you, Dinah said.People are going to die of it.But the trade is as follows, Rhys said.Izzy already has a massive battering ram of nickel iron on her snout.Her flanks are vulnerable, as we learned today.Now we have the ability to shroud everythingthe entire space stationin reinforced ice.Oh, it will dwindle over time.But through most of the Big Ride well be living deep inside of a gigantic iceberg with a steel nose.I submit that the death toll from possible contamination will be minor compared to what we would experience if we went on the same journey unprotected.What do you need to make it happen?Ivy asked.Permission, Dinah said.When did you ever ask for that before?The joke elicited a high pitched laugh from the corner of the conference room.Heads turned toward Camila.Camila, Ivy said, weve hardly heard a word from you since we found you in the Shipyard.One of our witnesses there claims you may have saved Teklas life.You had the opportunity to escape with Julia.Instead you stayed behind to free the bound Shipyard workers.You saved their lives.Now youre here among us.You must know how this looks.The look on Camilas face made it clear that how it looked had never crossed her mind.She didnt even get what Ivy was saying.Dear, Luisa said, people are going to say you are a spy who volunteered to be left behind.Camila held up a closed fist and opened it to reveal a small white plastic box, loose tape still dangling from it.Julias bug, she announced.It was here.No one looked very convinced.She invited me to dinner at the White House, Camila said.She helped me pick out a dress.She introduced me to generals, ambassadors, movie stars.She wrote me letters on White House stationery.I wasI was in love with her.You can call me naive if you want.All right.I was naive.Until this morning.And then all of a sudden I saw.I saw what I was dealing with.I hate her now.And I hate myself for having been in love with her.Best remember that, sweetheart, Moira said.Because she made the wrong choice today.And sooner or later, shell be coming back.Ill be ready, Camila said.Endurance  SEEN BY HUMAN EYES, THE HOLLOW HULK OF YMIRS ICE SHARD WAS as dead, brittle, and gleaming as the discarded carapace of a beetle.Captured through the electronic eyes of cameras, then speeded up a hundred thousandfold, so that the events of one day were compressed into one second of video, it looked like an amoeba pursuing, capturing, and swallowing Izzy.A person with no preconceptions of what they were watching would perceive Izzy as a steel headed insect, all legs and pods and antennas, twitching and kicking in an effort to defend itself from the slow, relentless, liquid onslaught of the ice monster.In truth, of course, the four hundred survivors, moving at lightning speed compared with the slow evolutions of the ice, were reconfiguring the space station in preparation for the Big Ride.The crippled Caboose was cut free and the components of the Shipyard moved forward.The big power reactor was brought in close to the Stack; from now on they would rely on ice to shield the rest of Izzy from its radiation.The eighty one arklets arranged themselves into nine groups of nine and were tacked into place at the aft end, nozzles aimed backward.The structural works holding them into place at first were flimsy trellises on which spacewalkers could string cables, propellant lines, and hamster tubes.As soon as those were in place, the ice caught up with them, driven forward by the ceaseless operations of a giant Nat swarm, and the arklets were gradually cemented into place within a solid matrix of the fiber reinforced ice known as pykrete.Forward the ice flowed.It was like watching video of a melting iceberg played in reverse.The Nats, blindly following a simple collection of rules, packed it into every vacant space they happened upon.In the few minutes out of each day when the crew could take some rest and eat some rations, they would try to top each other telling funny stories about where they had found a living infestation of ice, and what they had done to beat it back.Within a month, the remnants of Ymir had all been consumed, and Izzy had seemingly ceased to exist.The two of them had merged into an orbiting mountain.Its summit was a battered and scarified lump of nickel iron, hazy with angular scaffolding where antennas and sensors were mounted.Its slopes were a smooth rampart of black ice, interrupted here and there by outcroppings of thrusters or other equipment, observation domes peeking out like hermits huts.Its base was a plane decorated with a neat grid of eighty one small holes from which blue white fire erupted from time to time as the ship passed through her perigee.They couldnt make out what to call the thing.People tried and failed to combine the words Izzy and Ymir.The closest they came was Izmir, but that had been the name of a city in Turkey.Sentiment was in favor of naming her after the martyrs of the Ymir expedition, but there had been several.In honor of Markus it was likened to the Daubenhorn, later shortened to the Horn.Which was not a bad nickname.But the name that stuck was a continuation of the Shackleton theme that Markus had established with New Caird.Shackletons big ship had been called Endurance, and was famous for having gotten stuck in the ice.So Endurance it was, and Fyodor christened her thus by getting into his battered Orlan, climbing out onto the surface of Amalthea, and dashing a bottle of champagne against the metal.A more distant camera, looking down on Earth from high above the North Pole and watching the career of Endurance over the next years, would have seen a nail biter of an opening, followed by endless grinding tedium, slowly building to a dramatic final reel.Prior to Ymirs arrival, the Cloud Arks pilots had put no small amount of attention into the problem of keeping Izzy out of the expanding atmosphere.This produced greater drag, which Amalthea, with its high ballistic coefficient, was well made to resist.But the decay of her orbit had to be mended from time to time with burns of the big engine that in those days had lived on the aft end of the Caboose, fueled by the Shipyards reactor powered splitters.The Breakas they called the event when the big bolide had smashed into Izzy, and the Swarm and Red Hope had gone their separate wayshad put an end to all that.Between then and the day about a month later when Endurance was christened, she spiraled gradually downward.Had the featherweight arklets tried to keep formation with her, theyd have been pushed back by the wind.They were forced to creep into the lee of Amalthea and ride along within her bow wave, like bicyclists slipstreaming behind a truck, until they could be integrated into the framework of the ship.Down and down she spiraled, and the SI team had to send Grabbs out onto the forward trusswork and remove the fragile antennas and sensors mounted there, lest they be slowly burned off by a rarefied but white hot windblast.Fyodors champagne space walk was a brief one, and when he got back inside he reported that he could see the spraying foam of the champagne being blown backward by the atmosphere.Their mission was to move their apogee from where it was nowjust a few kilometers higher than the altitude of the perigeeall the way out to the altitude of Cleft, some 378,000 kilometers more distant.It was a reversal of the maneuvers that Markus, Dinah, Jiro, and Vyacheslav had executed in order to bring Ymir into orbital sync with Izzy.The way to achieve it was to burn the engines for brief intervals as Endurance made her regular swings through perigee.The first of those burns happened about thirty minutes after she was christened, and yielded a delta vee of four meters per second.The acceleration was so mild that most of the crew could not even sense it.For the combined thrust of eighty one arklet engines was nearly powerless against the bulk of Endurance, with her roughly equal masses of iron and ice.Nonetheless it was enough to boost her apogee, which occurred some forty six minutes later, by 14.18 kilometers.And forty six minutes after that, another burn during another scrape with the atmosphere gained them another four meters per second that, at the ensuing apogee, added 14.21 kilometers on top of that.The result of Endurances first day of operations was a boost in apogee altitude of more than one hundred kilometers, enough to get them clear of the expanded atmosphere except during the few minutes each orbit when they swung through perigee.After that, however, they had to suspend operations, since theyd used up all the propellant stored in the Shipyards ice buried tanks.They needed to give the reactor and the splitters some time to catch up.Even a nuclear power plant could split water only so fast.Not long after, the operation was shut down for a week by problems in feeding clean water to the system.For another month it could only operate at about a quarter of its planned capacity.But over time they worked the bugs out and began to burn the engines more and more at each perigee, gradually extending Endurances reach toward Cleft.If they could keep it up, that reach would get less gradual over time.The first delta vee had gained them 14.18 kilometers.The second, equivalent delta vee had reaped 14.21 kilometersan improvement of about thirty meters.These gains were tiny in comparison to the distances of outer space, but from a mathematical standpoint the trend was extremely significant.It meant that the higher they wentthe more elongated the orbit becamethe more leverage they could obtain from each one of those tiny delta vees.That difference of thirty meters would grow and grow until it spanned many kilometers, and each of those improvements would feed back into the equations and amplify the next result a little bit more.It was an exponential sort of phenomenon, and this time humanity was on the right side of it.This didnt even take into account another piece of good mathematical news, which was that Endurance grew a little bit lighter with each one of those burns.She had less mass with which to resist the force of the thrusters, and so it gradually became possible to produce more than a piddling four meters per second of delta vee on each turn around the planet.So everything was going to get better, if they could stay alive and keep Endurance working.But these gains accrued painfully slowly at the beginning.IT ENDED UP TAKING THREE YEARS.They had planned for one.It took longer because things kept breaking and needed to be fixed.The tools and supplies needed to fix them werent always available.Sometimes they had to be improvised.Elaborate workarounds had to be devised through the force of human ingenuity, hard work, and, when all else failed, the risking and the sacrifice of lives.The human capital of Endurance dwindled.They were always short on food.Arklets were designed to grow their own food supplies in their translucent outer hulls.But Endurances arklets were buried in ice to protect them from the Hard Rain.The ones near the outside got enough sunlight to produce some food, but not enough compared to the mouths that had to be fed.She began her journey well stocked with emergency provisions, which were rationed out on a schedule that assumed a mission length of one year.As it became clear that the journey would go on much longer, the rations were cut back.Endurance also had abundant stockpiles of vitamins, most of which had survived the Break.These were sought after by the people of the Swarm, who had flown the coop without stockpiling enough of them.Trade began to happen between Endurance and the Swarm, but it wasnt the free market that the Swarmamentalists had once envisioned.Deals were negotiated over the radio and consummated by exchanges between MIVs and arklets, difficult to arrange because of the need to match orbits that had now become very different.As they had done with Ymir, they mined ice from the interior volume of Endurance, leaving the outer walnut shell as a structural support and as a first line of defense against bolides.But as J. B. F.  and other Dump and Run partisans had never tired of pointing out, such a heavy craft lacked maneuverability.When a big rock was seen far enough in advance, they could use her engines to make small course changes that would have large outcomes by the time the rock came close.Doing so was the full time occupation of most of Endurances complement, which worked at it three shifts a day.But below a certain threshold they could not see rocks soon enough, or maneuver out of their way quickly enough, and then they just had to hope that the bolide would strike Amalthea.Most did, but some hit the icy lower slopes, and of those, some struck with enough power to penetrate and kill.Suicide took about one in ten over the course of the three year journey.Sometimes this was for traditional reasons.After a great burst of creative activity during the weeks when Endurance was being designed and crafted, Rhys fell into a black depression and took his own life a month into the voyage.In other cases a spacewalker agreed to go on what was clearly a suicide mission, or a patient suffering from cancer decided to end her life rather than create a drain on limited resources of food, air, and medical supplies.And there was quite a bit of cancer, for Dinahs prediction on the day of the Break had been borne out.In spite of all precautions, particles of fallout made their way into the air and the food chain and lodged in lungs and guts.Even without this, the environment of space, with its ambient radiation, lack of exercise, poor diet, and exposure to various chemicals, tended to jack up the cancer rate.Endurances medical facilities were not up to the job of detecting and treating cancer in the way people had been used to on Earth.Periodic crises in the supplies of food and air, caused by blights in the greenhouses or breakdowns in equipment, took away people whose strength had been sapped to begin with.The journey entailed thousands of traversals of the Van Allen radiation belts.Rather than passing through these but one or two times, as might have been the case in a more traditional space voyage, they had to do it twice on each orbit; and during the first year they were, for all practical purposes, never out of them.They sheltered as much as they could in shielded parts of the ship.But no shelter was perfect.Some of the crew were obliged by duty or by happenstance to remain in exposed locations.And the mere fact of being crammed together in a confined space for a significant fraction of the time was a drag on health.The gender ratio began to skew even more toward females.The General Population, whose Break surviving members had made up roughly a quarter of Endurances original complement, had been predominantly male.This was a simple consequence of the fact that they had been drawn from traditionally male dominated professions such as the military, the astronaut corps, and science and engineering.The other three quarters had been Arkies.The original Arkie population had been 75 percent female and 25 percent male.The ones who had elected to stay with Endurance at the time of the Break were more strongly skewed toward women.The men tended to be olderin many cases two or even three times the age of the Arkies.Compared to the Arkies, who had mostly been sent up at the last minute, they tended to have been in space, and subject to its health effects, for much longer.They had been picked for brains, not for physical fitness.At least at the beginning, while the Arkies were still learning the ropes, they tended to draw the most hazardous duty, such as space walks.And men simply were not as well suited to life in space.They were more biologically vulnerable to radiation.They needed more air and more food.And, whether it was the result of cultural upbringing or genetic programming, they simply were not cut out psychologically for the idea that they were going to spend the rest of their lives in crowded indoor spaces.Many of them felt an urge to go outside and get away from people that manifested itself as a tendency to volunteer for more space walks.People who went on space walks were much more likely to die of radiation exposure, bolide strikes, equipment malfunction, misadventure, or contamination by reactor fallout.As well, there was an understanding, widely shared but rarely spoken of, that men were not the scarce resource.Womento be specific, healthy, functional wombswere.Acting on that belief, or perhaps just electing a more socially constructive form of suicide, men continued volunteering for hazard duty, instinctively herding the women toward the protected interior spaces of the ship; and when the women objected to it, as some did, they were apt to be shut down by the simple, hard to argue with assertion that their lives and health had to be preserved at all costs.Communication with the Swarm was sporadic and tended to come in bursts, when the Swarm needed something.The groups had separated under conditions that would have been deemed a state of war had the Break not happened in the midst of a catastrophe more deadly than anything that one side could have inflicted upon the other with force of arms.Neither side was likely to begin trusting the other anytime soon.Free, Internet style communication between them was forbidden on both sides, since it could have been used for purposes that were mischievous or worse.The channel between Swarm and Endurance was more akin to a hotline linking two Cold War capitals.It went unused for months at a time.This was not so much a matter of the two sides snubbing each other as it was that they were both fully occupied trying to stay alive.Ivy and J. B. F.  were like the captains of two damaged ships, many miles apart in stormy seas, with other things on their minds.When the channel was used, it was to negotiate terms of exchanges between the two groups.Neither side was of a mind to share much information about its status.But much could be inferred from the things that the Swarm urgently asked for: mostly propellant, but also the sort of medicine used to treat radiation sickness, blight resistant strains of food crops, nutrients, spare parts for CO2 scrubbers and for the Stirling engines that supplied power to arklets.In exchange they offered mostly food, which was the only thing they could make that Endurance didnt already have.Eleven weeks following the Break, a solar flare had occurred, followed by an event known as a coronal mass ejection: a vast release of charged particles hurled out from the sun into the solar system.With its array of sensors, some of which were always pointed toward the sun for just this reason, Endurance had seen the storm coming and had sent a warning message to the Swarm.In those days Endurance had been well inside the protection of the Earths magnetosphere.That plus the shielding provided by iron and ice had enabled her crew to ride out the storm with little exposure to its radiation.They had no way of knowing, though, whether the Swarm had even received or understood the warning.The danger of coronal mass ejections had been well understood by the Arkitects, who had provided storm shelters in each arklet: sleeping bags, in effect, made so that water could be pumped into the space between their inner and outer walls, surrounding the occupant with molecules that were good at absorbing high energy protons.The arklets were also stocked with doses of a drug called amifostine, which protected DNA from damage produced by the free radicals generated in the body by radiation exposure.The scheme was a good one provided the Arkies had at least half an hours advance warning and enough water in their arklets tanks to fill up all the shelters.They practiced it every so often, as sailors would perform lifeboat drills.But there was a lot that could go wrong, and it seemed unlikely that all eight hundred Arkies had made it through the storm unscathed.In the ensuing three years there had been ten more coronal mass ejections big enough to worry about.Endurance had transmitted a warning to the Swarm in each of those cases but never received an acknowledgment.It was worrisome that the Swarm always seemed to want more water.Since the water of an arklets ecosystem was recycled, the only way the arklet could lose it was by expending it as propellant: splitting it into hydrogen and oxygen and feeding it to a thruster.All the arklets in a swarm would have to do this from time to time, simply in order to remain in formation.That was true even if they never dodged a rock and never changed their orbit around the Earth.But it seemed that they had changed their orbit on several occasions, making it higher and more circular to keep it clear of the Van Allen belts.Presumably they had their reasons for doing so.But if they ran so low on water that they couldnt fill their storm shelters when needed, they were open to a disaster that might kill most or all of them at a stroke.Ivy could only assume that they were still reasonable people and that if things got that bad, they would call for help.In the meantime, she tried to guard against the seductive idea that Endurance had all the water it could ever need.There werent going to be any more Ymir expeditions.The water they carried with them might be all that the human race had to live on for hundreds of years.She had already made up her mind what she would say if J. B. F.  ever contacted her with an urgent demand for storm shelter water: nothing doing, come to us, rejoin the crew of Endurance and take shelter here.She wondered, sometimes, if J. B. F.  had anticipated that Ivy would make such a demand, and just how far she was willing to go to avoid such an unconditional surrender.WELL, THAT WAS HARD, DOOB CROAKED, THEN WETTED HIS WHISTLE with a swig of the Ardbeg, mixed with a few drops of five billion year old asteroid water.He was in the Banana, speaking to an empty room, staring up at a projection screen on the wall.His reading glasses no longer worked; zero gravity had changed the shape of his eyeballs.The people who knew how to operate the lens grinding machine were all dead or missing, so there was no way to make new eyeglasses until someone figured out where the machine had been squirreled away and read the instruction manual.Since only twenty eight people remained alive on Endurance, this didnt look like it would happen anytime soon.His distance vision was still pretty good, but because of the problem with the glasses he didnt like to use his laptop for long periods of time.Instead he would come here to the Banana, soak up a little gravity, plug the computer into the projector cable, and work at long range.He had been here for an hour, because he didnt want to miss the big moment.He knew exactly when that moment would occur, plus or minus a few seconds, but in the meantime he couldnt concentrate on anything else.The other twenty seven were asleep or busy.So he was celebrating alone.The display in front of him was dominated by a single large window displaying six numbers in fat, easy to read block letters.These were the orbital parameters of Endurance.They were updated several times a second, the numbers blurring and twitching.The one he was focusing on was labeled R, short for Radius.It was the distance separating Endurance from the center of Earth.At the moment, it was the highest it had ever been, at 384,512,933 meters and still climbing, slowly, in the last few digits.Endurance was creeping toward apogee, the highest apogee she had ever attained, and the height of that apogee was slightly beyond the distance at which the moon had once orbited Earth.For the first time they were as high in the sky, now, as Cleft.Loose objects shifted position as Endurances remaining engines came on.They were down to thirty seven functioning arklet engines from the original complement of eighty one.On a good day they could muster thirty nine.The other half of them had been cannibalized to keep the good ones working.To compensate for the losses, they had jury rigged all the other engines they could get: the big one from the Caboose, all the propulsion units that had once been part of the Shipyard, and a few spare motors from straggler arklets that had become separated from the Swarm and found a way to rejoin them.Despite the reduction in engine power, Endurance was at least as maneuverable now as she had been at the beginning, when she had wallowed at the bottom of Earths gravity well, burdened with years worth of propellant.She weighed half as much now as she had in those days.The burn went on for a while.It concluded with a change in attitude and a burn in another direction.Doob didnt have to read the numbers on the screen to know what they were doing.Theyd been planning it for three years.They were in a highly eccentric orbit now, a pair of hairpin turns welded together by straightaways a third of a million kilometers long.Earth nestled deep in the crook of one of those hairpins.Endurances perigee hadnt changed in three years; on every one of the thousands of orbits they had made, they had screamed across the top of Earths atmosphere while running their engines full blast.On the last such pass, which theyd made about five days ago, theyd topped out at more than eleven thousand meters per second of velocity.The visual symmetry of the orbit was deceptive; at their current location, the opposite hairpin, now slightly beyond the old moons orbit, they were crawling along at a speed that could have been matched, back in the day, by a wheeled vehicle on a salt flat.They were like a car on a roller coaster that had been towed all the way to the top and that was creeping along in that moment before it begins the plunge down to the bottom.The Earth was the size of a ping pong ball at arms length.Soon theyd begin falling toward it, building back up toward eleven thousand meters per second during their next perigee pass, five days from now.In the meantime, though, during these few minutes when they were just inching along, they could work magic.Small changes in velocity out here led to enormous transformations in their orbit down there.Endurance, by dint of enduring for three years and persevering in her plan, had reached Clefts distance from Earth.But shed always been in the wrong plane: the same plane that Izzy had started out in, the plane that had been chosen, seemingly a million years ago, because it was easily reached from the Baikonur Cosmodrome.Down there, deep in the gravity well, changing that plane would have been catastrophically expensive.If theyd had an Earth to go back to, it would have been cheaper to start from scratch and build a new space station than to move Izzy to the plane where the moon had once orbited.Up here, though, by burning the engines at apogee, they could nudge it closer and closer to the desired plane at much lower cost.So theyd been doing little plane change maneuvers at each apogee.It had been going on for months now.It was a thing that had to happen if they were ever to reach Cleft, but it made Doobs stomach burn, made him wish he hadnt had a couple of slugs of hoarded single malt.For the plane of the old moonthe place they had to go to find safe refuge in Cleftwas where all the rocks were.That was where the rocks had started out, at Zero, and for the most part that was where they had stayed.The ones that had fallen to Earth in the Hard Rain were only a tiny fraction of the lunar debris cloud: just a faint dusting compared to what remained up here.During most of Endurances journey, her pilots had, by choice, kept her in that angled Baikonur compatible plane, well clear of the moons debris field.Otherwise they could never have survived for this long.But the risk that they had to accept, in order to try for Cleft, was to fly through the debris cloud in which Cleft swam.Every time they had reached an apogee in the last few months, and burned their engines to bring their orbit closer to the plane of their destination, they had edged into dirtier and more dangerous space.Their slowness was part of the problem.If the debris cloud was a fleet of cars roaring around a circular raceway at top speed, then Endurance was a child toddling out into traffic.That extreme disparity in speed would remain until the next apogee, ten days from now, when they would make their biggest and longest burn, expending all of Endurances remaining propellant to accelerate her to the same average speed as the debris cloud.In so doing, theyd convert the dual hairpin orbit into a nearly perfect circle, remaining 384,512,933 meters from Earth forever.Having merged smoothly with the traffic on the circular raceway, they would go hunting for Cleft.Doob had spied it several times on his optical telescopes, gotten a fix on its params, knew how to find it.This was his lifes work.If hed been asked several years ago, before Zero, hed have said it was something else.But his life until Day 360 had been nothing more than preparation for the mission plan he had laid in and was now executing for Endurance.The day of the Breakthe arrival of the propellant needed, the death of his friend and colleague Konrad, and the sundering of the Swarmhad made it clear what needed to be done, and who needed to do it.So hed been doing it.Ten days remained until they were swimming in the debris cloud.Perhaps a fortnight before they reached Cleft.He wondered if he would live to see it.Quite obviously, he had cancer.Diagnostic facilities were lacking, but the first undeniable symptoms had been in his digestive tract, and since then his liver had become swollen by metastases.Now he was feeling some weird stuff in his lungs.It had grown slowly.It might have been natural causessomething that had been seeded on Old Earth, before he had even come to spaceor it might have been a piece of fallout that had made its way into his food and gotten caught in his gut.No matter.The main question on his mind was whether he would live to see Cleft.He actually didnt feel that bad, and so the naive answer would be yes, of course; but cancer growth was something of an exponential phenomenon, and he knew how tricky those could be.Bolor Erdene was flying the ship, working in the Hammerheadthe deeply sheltered control room that they had built into the lee side of Amalthea.Or at least she was on the duty roster as the nominal pilot.Distinctions of rank and specialty had ceased to matter much.Everyone who had survivednine men and nineteen womenknew how to do everything: fly the ship, fix an arklet engine, go on a space walk, program a robot.The Doob of a few years ago would have ridden it out in the Hammerhead with her, looking over her shoulder, checking the params, swapping witty remarks in the occasional moment of downtime.The Doob sitting in the Banana right now had seen it all before, thousands of times, and knew that it was as routine to Bo, or to any of the survivors, as driving to work would have been before Zero.Being there would only have gotten his stomach riled up.
