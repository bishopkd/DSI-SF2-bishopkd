Fassin had seen her turn down a couple of very nice, decent lads with a bruising degree of brusqueness, and then take off for what were pretty obviously one  or few nighters with burly but boring guys.He had also known at least three girls in their school year who were hopelessly in love with Taince, but she hadnt cared about that either.Saluus had been in an even stronger position from the start; not just good looking  anybody could be that  but easy with it, and assured, charming and funny as well.All that and money!A fortune to inherit, another beckoning world of even more finely graded superiority that existed alongside the monumental, bamboozling, hierarchic system that had surrounded them all since birth, presenting an alternative infrastructure of reward which was both younger and older than the Mercatorias colossal edifice, if ultimately entirely subordinate to it.Like the rest of the boys in his year  like most in the entire college  Fassin had long since come to terms with the fact that as long as Sal was around, you were always second best.And yet neither Taince nor Sal  especially Sal  took advantage of their chances.Except maybe with each other.It was like they were adults before their time, with their own steely, determined agendas, and sex was no more than an itch that had to be scratched, an irritating unter hunger which sporadically necessitated being dealt with as quickly and efficiently as possible with the minimum of distractive fuss, so that the real, serious business of life could be attended to.Weird.Why?Taince asked.Did you go to Sev School too, Fass?Me?Fassin said, astonished.Shit, no!Right, Taince said.She was sitting with one leg stretched out, one folded, hand resting on her knee.So, she flapped her hand.Tough, is it?They hunt them!Fassin told her.Taince shrugged.So Ive heard.At least they dont eat them.Ha!They still die sometimes.Im serious.These are just little kids.They fall off cliffs or out of trees or into crevasses or they kill themselves, theyre so stressed.Some get lost in the outwoods and get hunted and killed and eaten by real predators.Mm hmm.High drop out rate, then.Taince, doesnt any of that bother you?Taince grinned at him.What, you mean arouse my maternal instincts, Fass?He didnt answer.She shook her head.Well, it doesnt.You want to ask me do I feel sorry for these junior members of the Acquisitariat?Yes, for the ones that dont make it out.Or the ones that leave hating their parents.For the others, it does what its supposed to do, I guess; produces another generation of the truly selfish.Well, not my department.Dont even think about them.If I did maybe Id despise them, but I dont so I dont.Maybe Id admire them.Sounds worse than basic training.You have a choice with basic training.These little  Not if youre drafted.Drafted?Laws are still on the statute books.She shrugged.But your point is taken.Its tough on those kids.But its legal and, well, the rich are another breed.She sounded unconcerned.Sals really never said anything?Something in his tone made Taince look at Fassin.You mean, like, she waggled her dark eyebrows, afterwards, Fassin?He looked away.As you will.Taince looked at him again.Fass, is this really all about whether Sal and I fuck?No!Well, we do.Now and again, thank you for asking.That settled any bets?Made you any money?Oh, please, he said.Damn, he thought, Im not sure I really wanted to know that, now that I do.Fassin quite enjoyed thinking about some of the potential or actual couples and other groupings of his class and year having sex  grief, hed watched\been part of the real thing a few times  but the thought of Sal and Taince bumping bits was slightly grisly.Taince hoisted one eyebrow.Ask nicely and maybe sometime well let you watch.Thats what you like, isnt it?Fassin felt himself colouring despite his best efforts.Why, I live for nothing else, he said, attempting sarcasm.And no, he hasnt mentioned Severity School, Taince told him.Not before, during or after.Unless I was a lot more distracted than I thought I was.But it sounds horrific!Cold showers, hot bunking, corporal punishment, deprivation, intimidation, denigration, and, for a holiday, you get to run for what might be your life!Taince snorted.You end up paying good money for the sort of treatment your ancestors spent their short, brutal lives trying to avoid.Thats progress.I think the guys been damaged by it, Fassin said.Im serious.Oh, Im sure you are, Taince drawled, sounding bored.Sal seems to be okay with it, all the same.Says it made him.Yeah, but made him what?Taince grinned.Its all your peoples fault, anyway.Oh, Fassin sighed, not this.Well, its a Dweller thing, isnt it?Yeah?And so fucking what?Well, who brought that particular little nugget of information regarding kin kid hunting blinking into the light?Taince asked, still grinning.You guys, thats who.Seers  They werent  Well, Dwellers Studies, whatever.Taince waved her hand dismissively.They hunt their children, theyre a long term, widespread, successful species and theyre right on our doorstep.Some wizzer comes along looking for the latest way to fleece the rich.What sort of lesson do you think theyre going to take from that?Fassin shook his head.The Dwellers have been around for most of the life of the universe, theyve spread throughout the galaxy but despite their head start on everybody else theyve had the good grace not to remake the whole place to suit themselves, theyve formalised war to the point that hardly anybody ever dies and most of their lives work is spent tending the greatest accumulations of knowledge ever assembled  But we were told  Albeit in the galaxys most disorganised libraries which they show enormous reluctance to let anybody else into, yes, but all the same: they were peaceful, civilised and everywhere before Earth and the Sun even formed, and whats the one lesson weve taken from them with any enthusiasm?Hunt your kids.Your lecture notes are showing, Taince told him.The Dwellers, notoriously, hunted their own young.The species was present in the majority  the vast majority  of the gas giant planets in the galaxy, and in every planetary society of theirs that had been sufficiently thoroughly investigated, it had been discovered that the mature Dwellers preyed upon their own children, hunting them singly or in packs (on both sides), sometimes opportunistically, as often in highly organised long term hunts.To the Dwellers this was entirely natural.Just a normal part of growing up, absolutely a part of their culture without which they would not be themselves, and something they had been doing for billions of years.Indeed, some of those who could be bothered attempting to justify the practice to upstart alien busybodies claimed with some authority that young hunting was precisely one of the many reasons that Dwellers were still around after all that amount of time to indulge in such harmless fun in the first place.It wasnt just their species that was long lived, after all; individual Dwellers had, allegedly, lived for billions of years, so if they werent to use up even the colossal amount of living space provided by all the gas giant planets in the galaxy (and, theyd sometimes hint, beyond), they had to keep numbers down somehow.And interfering outside species  especially those whose civilisations were inevitably so short lived that they were called the Quick  would do well not to forget that the Dwellers doing the hunting had been hunted in their turn as well, and those being hunted would have their chance to become the hunters in the future.And anyway, if you had every prospect of living for hundreds of millions of years, being hunted for at most about a century and a bit was such a trivially insignificant detail that it was scarcely worth mentioning.They dont feel any pain, Taince, Fassin told her.Thats the point.They dont entirely understand the concept of physical suffering.Not emotionally.Which I still beg to find unlikely.But, oh, so what?What are you saying?Theyre not intelligent enough to feel mental anguish?Even mental pain isnt really what we understand as pain when theres no physiological equivalent, no template, no circuitry.That this years theory, is it?Exo Ethics 101?A moderately powerful ground quake shook the surface they were sitting on, but they ignored it.The huge, tattered strips of material hanging high above stirred.All Im saying is, theyre a civilisation we could learn a lot more from than just how to abuse our young.Thought they arent even a civilisation, technically  Oh, good grief, Fassin sighed.Well?Yeah, well, depends what definition you accept.To some theyre post civilisational, because the individual groups on each gas giant have so little contact with each other, to others theyre a diasporian civilisation, which is the same thing expressed more kindly, to others still theyre just a degenerate example of how to almost take over an entire galaxy and then fail, because they just lost interest, or they somehow forgot what the purpose of the operation was in the first place, or they misplaced their ruthlessness and came over all coy and conservational and decided it would only be fair to give everybody else a chance, too, or they were warned off by some higher power.All of which might be true, or nonsense.And thats what Dweller Studies is all about.Maybe one day well know for sure What?There was something about the way Taince was looking at him.Nothing.Just wondering.You still sticking to the line you havent decided what to do after college?I might not become a Seer, Taince, or anything to do with Dweller Studies; it isnt compulsory.We dont get drafted.Mm hmm.Well, she said, time for another attempt to contact the real world.She rose smoothly to her feet.Coming?Mind if I stay behind?Fassin rubbed his face, looked around.Bit tired.I think were safe enough here, yeah?Guess so, Taince told him.Back soon.She turned and tramped off into the darkness, quickly disappearing and leaving Fassin alone with the soft lights of the flier in the vast, unechoing space.He did and didnt want to fall asleep, and after a few moments alone thought that maybe he didnt feel so secure here by himself after all, and nearly went after Taince, but then thought he might get lost, and so stayed where he was.He cleared his throat and sat more upright, telling himself he wasnt going to fall asleep.But he must have, because when the screams started, they woke him.* * *  He left in the false dawn of an albedo sunrise, Ulubis still well below the horizon but lighting up half the facing hemisphere of Nasqueron, flooding the Northern Tropical Uplands of glantine with a soft, golden brown light.A small yellow auroral display to the north added its own unsteady glow.Hed already said various goodbyes to friends and family in the Sept the night before and left messages for those, like his mother, he couldnt contact immediately.Hed left Jaal asleep.Slovius, somewhat to Fassins surprise, came to see him off at the house port, a hundred metre circle of dead flat granite coldmelt a kilometre downslope from the house, near the river and the gently rising edge of the Upland forest.Light rain fell from high, thin clouds moving in from the west.A sleek, soot black Navarchy craft, maybe sixty metres long, sat on a tripod of struts at the centre of the circle, radiating heat and bannered by drifting steam.They stopped and looked at it.Thats a needle ship, isnt it?Fassin said.His uncle nodded.I do believe it is.You will be going to Pirrintipiti in some style, nephew.Sloviuss own suborb yacht, a streamlined yet stubbier machine, half the size of the black Navarchy ship, lay on a circular parking pad just off the main circle.They walked on, Fassin in his thin one piece gee suit, worn under his light Sept robe, feeling as if he was walking with a sort of warm gel extending from ankle to neck.Fassin carried the grip holding his formal wear.A pony tailed servant had his other bag and held a large umbrella over Fassin.Sloviuss chair tub had extended a transparent cover above him.Another servant held the sleeping form of Fassins niece Zab in her arms; the child  up scandalously late the evening before and somehow hearing of her uncles summons to Sepekte  had insisted she wanted to say goodbye to Fassin and wheedled her grandfather and parents into granting permission, but then had fallen back asleep almost as soon as theyd left the house in the little funicular which served the port.Oh, and my regards to my old friend Seer Chief Chyne, of the Favrial, Slovius said as they crossed to the Navarchy craft.Should you see him.Oh, and most especially to Braam Ganscerel, of Sept Tonderon, naturally.Ill try to say hello to all who know you, uncle.I should have come with you, Slovius said absently.No, maybe not.A grey uniformed figure appeared from a drop platform under the black ship and walked towards them.The officer, a fresh faced, cheery looking woman, took off her cap, bowed to Slovius, and to Fassin said, Major Taak?Fassin stood looking at her for a moment, before recalling that officially he was now a major in the Shrievalty Ocula.Ah, yes, he said.First Officer Oon Dicogra, NMS 3304, the young woman said.Welcome.Please follow me.Slovius held out one flippery hand.I shall try to remain alive until your return, Major Nephew.He made a wheezing noise that was probably a laugh.Fassin gripped Sloviuss finger stubs awkwardly.Im rather hoping this is a false alarm and Ill be back in a few days.In any event, take care.Goodbye, Fassin.I shall.Goodbye.He kissed the still sleeping Zab lightly on the cheek, avoiding waking her, then followed the Navarchy officer to the platform, stepped up onto it and waved as the curve bottomed slab raised them into the ship.Well be pulling about 5.2 Earth gees most of the way, Dicogra said as Fassins robe and his luggage were secured in a brace cabinet.Are you happy with that?The physio profile we got on you says yes, but we have to check.Fassin looked at her.To Pirrintipiti?he asked.The local shuttles and suborbs accelerated a lot less sharply than that, and they did the trip in less than an hour.How tight was this schedule?No, to Borquille city, Dicogra said.Going straight there.Oh, Fassin said, surprised.No, 5.2 is fine.The planet moon glantines gravity was about a tenth of that, but Fassin was used to more.He thought about pointing out that his day job involved spending years at a time in a gravity field of over six Earth gees, but of course that was in a Dwellerine arrowship, pickled in shock gel, and didnt really count.First Officer Dicogra smiled, wrinkled her nose and said, Good for you.That physio report said you were quite a toughie.Still, well spend nearly twenty hours at that acceleration, with only a few minutes weightless right in the middle, so do you need to visit the heads?You know, the toilet?No, Im fine.She gestured at his groin, where a bulge like a sports box was the only place on his body where the grey, centimetre thick gee suit didnt hug the contours of his flesh.Any attachments required?she asked, smiling.No, thanks.Drugs to let you sleep?Not necessary.The ships captain was a whule, a species that always looked to Fassin like a cross between a giant grey bat and an even more scaled up praying mantis.She greeted Fassin briefly via a screen from the bridge and he was settled into a steep sided, semi reclined couch in a gimballed ball pod near the centre of the ship by First Officer Dicogra and a fragile seeming but dexterous whule rating who smelled, to the human nose, of almonds.The whule rating levered himself out with a snapping sound of wing membranes and Dicogra settled into the only other couch in the pod.Her preparations for a day of five gees continuous consisted of tossing her cap into a locker and adjusting her uniform underneath her.The ship lifted slowly at first and Fassin watched on a screen on the curved wall opposite as the ports circular landing ground fell away, the little figures there lifting their heads as the Navarchy craft rose.Zab might have waved one tiny arm, then the haze of clouds intervened, the view tilted and swung and the ship accelerated  the gimballed pod keeping him and Dicogra level in their seats  towards space.* * *  Was that screaming?His eyes flicked open.His neck hairs were standing on end, his mouth was dry.Dark.Still inside the ruined alien ship, his back resting against the dimly lit flier.Taince gone, away to the gap to check for comms reception.Oh shit, those were screams, from behind.Maybe shouting, too.He scrambled to his feet, looking around.Little to see; just the faint traces of the warped landscape of destruction and collapse that was the interior of the wrecked ship, the tilted decks and bulkheads, the huge hanging strips of whatever the hell hanging from the invisibly dark and distant ceiling.The screams were coming from forward, from the interior, from the direction that Saluus and Ilen had walked in.He stood staring into that darkness, holding his breath to listen better.Sudden silence, then maybe a voice  Sals shouting, the words indistinct.Help?Taince?Fass?What do I do?Run to help?Wait for Taince?Look for another torch, another gun if there is one?A clattering noise behind him made him spin round.Taince, bounding down from one gnarled level of the buckled wall.You okay?Yes, but  Stay with me.Keep a few steps behind.Say if you cant keep up.She went past him at a slow run, her gun high in one hand.Later, he would remember that there was a grim sort of smile on her face.They ran up the shallow slope leading deeper into the ship, over increasingly large ripples in the material beneath their feet until they were leaping from ridge to ridge, then jumped down through a tear in the floor and ran slightly uphill on a half giving surface like thin rubber over iron, vaulting one handed over enormous, thigh high cables strung in an irregular net across the space.Fassin followed Taince as best he could, guided by the glow patches on her fatigues.She ran and leapt more fluidly with one hand filled with pistol than he did pumping both arms.The floor pitched up more steeply, then down.Taince!Fassin!Sal shouted, somewhere ahead.Duck!Taince yelled, suddenly running doubled up.Fassin got down just in time; his hair touched the hard fold of ink black material above.They slowed down, Taince feeling her way one handed along the dark ceiling, then slipping sideways through a narrow gap.Fassin followed, the cold press of ungiving material on either side making him shiver.Light ahead.A dim confusion of tilted floor and a half open chaos of girders and tubes forming a ceiling, spikes like stalagmites and stalactites, thin hanging cables, a frozen downward explosion of some red substance like an enormous inverted flower.And there, crouching on a narrow ledge by a jagged, vaguely triangular hole in the floor a couple of metres across, staring into it, lit by the glow patches stuck to his jacket, was Sal.He looked up.Len!he shouted.She fell!Sal, Taince said sharply, that floor safe for us?He looked confused, frightened.Think so.Taince tested the way ahead with one foot, then knelt by the triangular hole, right at one apex.She motioned Fassin to stay back, lay on her front and stuck her head into the hole, then, muttering something about the edges being braced, signalled Fassin to the side of the hole opposite Saluus.There was more room on that side.He lay and looked in and down.The triangle opened out into a darkly cavernous space beneath them, just vague glints of edged surfaces visible below; stepped collections of what looked like huge cooling fins.Fassins head seemed to swim, recognising how much of the wrecked ship was beneath the level they were on now.He remembered the flier climbing from the desert floor before entering the giant ship.How far had they climbed?A hundred metres?A little less?Plus the journey from the flier to here had been mostly uphill.Ilen lay about six metres down, caught on a couple of arm thick projections that stuck curving out from the nearest intact bulkhead beneath like two slim tusks.She lay on her front, her head, one leg and one arm hanging over the drop.Glow patches on her sleeves provided pale, greeny blue light.The fractured ends of the two tusk shaped protrusions were only centimetres from the side of her body.Off to one side at eight  or nine metre intervals, several more sets of the tusklike shapes clawed out from the bulkhead like bony fingers grasping at the gaping space.The drop below Ilen looked fifty or sixty metres deep, down to the bladelike edges of the fins beneath.The human mindset had had to adapt to places like glantine where gravity was weaker and a fall that would break both your legs on Earth was something you could walk away from.But given enough vertical space to accelerate into, a humans body would be just as injured or dead after a sixty metre drop here as it would after a thirty metre fall on Earth.Any rope?Taince asked.Sal shook his head.Oh God, oh fuck.No.Well, yes, but we left it back there.He nodded further into the ship.He seemed to shiver, hugging himself then putting up the collar of his jacket, as though cold.C couldnt undo the knot again.Shit!Shes moving, Taince said, then stuck her head into the hole and shouted, Ilen!Ilen, dont move!Can you hear me?Dont move!Just say if you can hear me!Ilen moved weakly, her head and the arm dangling over the drop shaking and shifting.She looked to be trying to roll over, but was edging still closer to the drop.Oh fuck, fuck, fuck, Sal said, his voice high and quick and strained.She was behind me.I thought she was all right.I didnt see anything, must have stepped over it.A hatch or something or it was just balanced and she must have knocked it and she was shouting, sort of balanced over it, one hand, and screaming, and I couldnt get back in time and she fell.We didnt even find anything, didnt do anything!Just junk!Oh fuck!She was fine!She was just behind me!Be quiet, Taince said.Sal sat back, rubbing his mouth, shaking.Taince put the gun back into her fatigues, slapped a glow patch onto her forehead, then, with her hands on two sides of the triangular hole, lowered her head into the gap again, further this time.She levered herself out for a second and looked back at Fassin.Hold my feet.Fassin did as he was told.Taince got her shoulders through the hole, then they heard her say, Ilen!You mustnt move!She hauled herself back out, leaving the glow patch where it was on her forehead like some strange, shining eye.Nothing to hold on to underneath here, she told them.Shes moving around.Must have hit her head.Shes going to fall.She looked at Sal.Sal, how far away is that rope?By time.Oh fuck!I dont know!Ten, fifteen minutes?Taince glanced back into the hole.Shit, she said quietly.Ilen she shouted.You must not move!She shook her head.Shit, shouting at hers just making her move, she said, as though to herself.She took a deep breath, looked at Saluus and Fassin.Okay.Heres what were going to do, she said.Daisy chain rescue.Practised this, its doable.Right, Sal said, sitting forward, his face pale in the dim light.What do we have to do?One holds on at the top, somebody climbs down their body, holds on to their feet, last person climbs down both and picks up Ilen.Ill do that bit.Sals eyes widened.But the person at the top  Will be you.Youre the strongest.Wouldnt work on Earth; does here, Taince told them.She slid over and grabbed Sals backpack.Seen it done with four links.You two guys look in good enough shape.Fass, youre in the middle.Plus person at the top gets tied on with these straps, she said, glancing at Sal and then pulling a knife from her fatigues and slicing into one set of shoulder straps.Sal knelt quaking at the side of the hole.Fucking God, Taince, he said, we all want to rescue her, but this could get us all killed.Fuck, oh fuck.I dont know.I dont fucking believe this, I just fucking dont.This isnt happening, this is just not fucking happening!He sat back again, visibly trembling.He looked at his shaking hands, turning them over and staring at them as though he didnt recognise them.I dont know if I have any grip, he said.I really dont.Youll be fine, Taince told him, busy with the straps.Oh fuck, were all going to fucking die, Sal said.Fucking hell.He shook his head hard.No.Not.Not.No.This will work, Taince said, quickly tying the cut straps to those still joined to the pack.Im calm, thought Fassin.Im probably in shock or something, but I feel calm.We might all be about to die, or it might be a close shave and a bonding thing we all remember for the rest of our long lives, but either way I feel calm.What will happen will happen and as long as we do our best and dont let each other down, no matter what happens well have been fine.He looked at his own hands.They were shaking, but not uncontrollably.He flexed them.He felt strong.He would do everything he could, and if that wasnt enough, that wasnt his fault.Sal jumped up, wobbling dangerously close to the hole.Theres more rope, he said suddenly.His face was still grey pale, but now almost expressionless.He moved past Taince.Fassin looked at him, wondering what he was talking about.What?Taince said, testing a square section stalagmite extrusion on the floor then flipping the pack straps over it.Rope, Sal said, pointing towards the outside and the flier.He took a backwards step in that direction.Theres more.In the flier.Ill go.I know where it is.He backed off further.Sal!Taince shouted at him.There isnt time!No, there is, Ill go, Sal said, still backing off.Stay fucking here, Sal, Taince said, dropping and deepening her voice.Sal seemed to hesitate but shook his head and turned and ran.Taince leapt and made a grab for him but hed moved too quickly.He vaulted a stalagmite and ran towards the gap Fassin and Taince had squeezed through earlier.Taince dropped to one knee and pulled the gun.Stop, you fucking coward!There might, Fassin thought, have been half a second when Taince could have fired, but she dropped the gun and stashed it in her fatigues as Sal sprinted, ducking through the gap and away.Taince looked at Fassin.Now her face had gone blank, he thought.Still a possibility, she said, and quickly stepped out of her fatigues.She wore a one piece underbody the same colour as her skin, so for just a moment she appeared to be naked.She reattached the top and trousers of the fatigues, snapping them tight to test that they held.Right, she said.Now, this ties to your ankle.The straps on the backpack held, and Fassin did too, wrists tied to them but taking his own weight and Tainces on his hands and fingers initially because he didnt trust the straps, and the knot tying Tainces trousers to his ankle held as well, and Taince was holding on fine as she shinned down over him and onto the fatigues and down with him twisting his neck and shoulders out and round so he could just about watch her progress and watch Ilen too, as though as long as he kept watching her shed be all right, but then there was a ground quake, shaking the ship, not badly, but enough to bring Fassin out in a cold sweat as he hung there, hands, palms, fingers slipping until it really was the straps and the straps alone holding him, and below him, below Taince, still just out of reach, Ilen moved one more time and fell over the edge and away into the darkness.Taince made a lunge and Fassin felt the link between them jerk as she clutched vainly at the girl and made a noise like a gasp or a hiss.Ilen dropped away into the shadows, tumbling slowly, her hair and clothes fluttering like pale, cold flame.Ilen must have still been mostly unconscious because she didnt even scream as she fell, so that they heard her body hit the strip of vanes far below, long seconds later, and might even have felt the impact through the fabric of the ship.Fassin had closed his eyes.Let Sal be right, let this not be happening.He tried to grip the edge of the hole again, to take the weight off the straps.Taince just hung there for a while.Lost her, she said quietly, and the way she said it Fassin was suddenly terrified that she was going to let go too and drop after Ilen, but she didnt.She just said, Coming back up now.Hold on.She climbed up and over him and helped him out.They looked down but couldnt see the body.They spent a few moments sitting side by side, breathing hard, with their backs against one of the stalagmites, a bit like theyd sat earlier, back at the flier.Taince untied her fatigues and put them on.She took the gun out.Fassin looked at it as she stood up.What are you going to do?he asked.She looked down at him.Not kill the fuck, if thats what youre thinking.She sounded calm now.She nudged one of his feet with her boot.We should get back.He stood up, a little shaky, and she held him by one arm.Did our best, Fass, she told him.Both of us did.We can grieve for Ilen later.What we do now is we go back to the flier, try to find Sal, see if we can get comms, get the fuck out of here and tell the authorities.They turned away from the hole.Why have you still got the gun out?Fassin asked.Sal, Taince said.Hes never been this humiliated.Never let himself down like this.Not to my knowledge.Grief and guilt.Does things to people.She was doing some sort of breathing exercise thing, taking quick breaths, holding them.Faint chance hell think if no one ever knows what happened here She shrugged.Hes got a gun.He might wish us harm.Fassin looked at her, unbelieving.You think?Seriously?Taince nodded.I know the guy, she told him.And dont be surprised if the fliers gone.It was gone.They walked out to the gap in the hull and found the flier there in the faint light of a false dawn coming from one thick sliver of sun struck Nasqueron.Sal was sitting looking out at the chill expanse of desert.Before they approached, Taince checked her military transceiver again and found that she had signal.She called the nearest Navarchy unit and gave a brief report, then they walked across the sand to the flier.Their phones were still out.Saluus looked round at them.Did she fall?he asked.We nearly got her, Taince said.Very nearly.She was still holding her gun.Sal put one hand over his face for a while.In his other hand he was gripping a thin, twisted, half melted looking piece of metal, and when he took his hand away from his face he started turning the metal fragment over and over in both hands.His gun lay with his jacket, on the back seat.Got through to the military, Taince told him.Alerts over.Just wait where we are.Theres a ship on its way.She got in the back, behind Sal.We were never going to save her, Tain, he told her.Fass, he said as the other man got into the other front seat beside him, we were just never going to save her.Wed only have got ourselves killed too.Find the rope?Fassin asked.He had a sudden image of taking the twisted piece of metal that Sal was playing with and sticking it into his eye.Sal just shook his head.He looked dazed more than anything else.Went over on my ankle, he said.Think it might be sprained.Barely made it back.Thought I could use the flier, get it through the stuff hanging above us and find a way over the top of all that wreckage, back to where it all happened, but the hanging stuff was more solid than it looked; came out here to try and signal.The piece of twisted metal kept going round and round in his hands.What is that?Fassin asked after a while.Sal looked down at it.He shrugged.From the ship.Just something I found.Taince reached round from behind him, wrenched the piece of metal from his hands and threw it away across the sand.They sat there in silence until a Navarchy suborb showed up.When Taince went out to meet it, Sal got out of the flier and went, limping, to retrieve the fragment.TWO:  DESTRUCTIVE RECALL   I was born in a water moon.Some people, especially its inhabitants, called it a planet, but as it was only a little over two hundred kilometres in diameter moon seems the more accurate term.The moon was made entirely of water, by which I mean it was a globe that not only had no land, but no rock either, a sphere with no solid core at all, just liquid water, all the way down to the very centre of the globe.If it had been much bigger the moon would have had a core of ice, for water, though supposedly incompressible, is not entirely so, and will change under extremes of pressure to become ice.(If you are used to living on a planet where ice floats on the surface of water, this seems odd and even wrong, but nevertheless it is the case. )This moon was not quite of a size for an ice core to form, and therefore one could, if one was sufficiently hardy, and adequately proof against the water pressure, make ones way down, through the increasing weight of water above, to the very centre of the moon.Where a strange thing happened.For here, at the very centre of this watery globe, there seemed to be no gravity.There was colossal pressure, certainly, pressing in from every side, but one was in effect weightless (on the outside of a planet, moon or other body, watery or not, one is always being pulled towards its centre; once at its centre one is being pulled equally in all directions), and indeed the pressure around one was, for the same reason, not quite as great as one might have expected it to be, given the mass of water that the moon was made up from.This was, of course,  I was born in a water moon.Some people, especially its inhabitants, called it a planet, but as it was only a little:   The captain broke off there, exponentially scrolling some of the rest across the screen, then stopping to read a line: Where a strange thing happened.He flicked further on, stopping again: I was born in a water moon.Some people, especially its  All like this?he asked his Number Three.All the same, it is believed, sir.It appears to repeat precisely the same few hundred words, time after time.About twelve to the seventeen times.That is all that is left of its memory.Even the base operating system and instruction sets have been overwritten.This is a standard abominatory technique known as destructive recall.It leaves no trace of what might have been there before?Trace is left, but that too reveals a short repetitive.Tech begs suggest this is merely the last of many iterative over writes.No trace remains of the machines true memories before it realised capture or destruction was inevitable.Indeed.The Voehn captain tapped a control to take the display through to the end.The screen froze for an appreciable moment, then displayed: I was born  This is the very last section of memory?Yes, sir.An expression another Voehn would have recognised as a smile crossed the captains face, and his back spines flexed briefly.This has been checked, Number Three?There is no other content, are no hidden messages?It is being checked, sir.The totality of the data exceeds our ships memory capacity and is being processed in blocks.What you see here is technically an abstraction.Time to accomplish?Another twenty minutes.Any other media capable of supporting significant stored information load?None.The construct was mostly what it appeared: a comet head.The main artificial part of it was the abomination at the core, the sensory and propulsion units being separate, surface mounted and motley.Tech informs fully checked.Original language used in the repeated piece?As seen: Old Standard.Origin of quoted piece?Unknown.A tentative analysis from Tech\Soc.rated nineteen per cent suggests it may be of Quaup origin.The Quaup, the majority of whom were part of the Mercatoria  the captain had served on a war craft with a Quaup officer  were of the meta species type people usually called blimps, small to medium sized balloon like creatures, air going oxygen processors.The repeated passage filling the captured machines memory was fairly obviously told from the point of view of a submersible waterworlder.Well, the captain thought, people wrote from the points of view of others.At primary college he himself had composed poems as though he was a Culmina, before he had realised this was a crime of presumption, confessed and rightly been punished for it.Quite put him off composition.The only major blot on the captains otherwise exemplary military education record had been a phase of remediation required to bring his Deployable Empathic Quotient up to scratch, this flaw later being diagnosed as a consequence of his shunning all such feelings after his inadvertent insult and subsequent disciplining.Still, he had made captain, which one did not do without some empathic subtlety, anticipating the feelings of both ones crew and ones opponents.He looked out at the half melted remains of the captured construct, a pitted, black body, comet disguised vessel which had been roughly eight hundred metres in diameter and was now missing a great quarter bite of structure.It lay a couple of kilometres off, radiating the last of the heat from its partial destruction, surrounded by a small system of wreckage, dark shards and splinters orbiting its ravaged body.The view, lit by one of their own ships attenuated CR beams, was about as clear and perfect as it could possibly be; there was no screen in the way, and not even any transparent hull material, atmosphere or other medium.The captain was looking straight out from the flying bridge of his ship, an open work nest of massive but elegantly sculpted girder work on the outside of the vessel.The vessel was unshared with any other species, crewed by Voehn only, happily, so the rest of the ship was open to vacuum too.For the duration of the action they had been deep in the guts of the ship, of course, safe in the core control space, sheltered by layers of shields and hull, senses protected by screens, but  once the wreck had been judged safe  the captain, his Number Three and a couple of favoured ratings had made their way to the exterior, the better to appreciate the view of their vanquished foe.The captain looked around, as if hoping to see some real comet nuclei floating past.Taking a bearing, zooming in, he could just make out the lights denoting the drives of his other two ships, ordered to return to the inner system once the engagement was over, two dim blue stars, untwinkling.Save those, all that was visible nearby was the ship beneath them and the wreck two klicks away.A cold and lonely spot to die, the captain thought.A logical, sensible choice of hiding place for the abomination machine, but still not a site any living  or apparently living  thing raised anywhere else would normally choose as a place to spend its last moments.He handed the screen back to his Number Three and turned his principal eyes to look out at the hulk again, his rear recessional signal pit and secondary eye complex still facing the junior officer, flickering the words,  Well, one mission part accomplished.Lay in a return to system base and, once the full contents of the abominations memory have been processed, deploy AM charges sufficient to leave residue no greater than elementary particle in size.Sir.Dismissed.* * *  The ship accelerated smoothly but moderately hard, creating a distant humming roar.Fassin had a little pad under his right forearm which sensed muscle movements there and adjusted the screen across from him  above from him, now, it felt, as the couch straightened out and the gee suit supported him  and so he got a glimpse of Pirrintipiti as the ship turned away from Nasqueron and headed deeper in system, to the next planet sunward, the more or less Earthlike Sepekte.On the screen, glantines tropical capital was a towered and shimmering smear draped across a scatter of dark green islands set in a pale green sea.Odd, already to be missing Pirri, he thought.He wouldnt have had a chance to set foot out of the port there, but hed been expecting the usual routine of transferring from a suborb to a tube train and then, somewhere in the bowels of the vast stalk, the Equatower, waiting for the lift up the cable to the satport and a space capable ship there.To be heading straight out from the Autumn House into space just seemed wrong somehow, a curious disconnect of the soul.Trips to Sepekte usually took anywhere from under five days to over a week at the standard one gee acceleration, depending on planetary alignment.The ships were large and comfortable and you could move around normally, visiting restaurants and bars, screens and gyms and, on the bigger liners, even swimming pools.The weightless minutes in the middle were an interlude for fun (and, often, some rushed and oddly unsatisfactory sex).People from glantine sometimes found the double weight of standard gee a little uncomfortable, but it was pretty much what theyd experience when they got to Sepekte anyway, so it was kind of like getting in training.The pressure of what the screen told him was three, four and then just over five gees settled into Fassin.The gee suit was sensing his breaths, gently helping him inflate his lungs without too much added effort.Think Ill take, First Officer Dicogra said, a snooze.Or would you, she asked, like to talk?Snooze away, he told her.Thinking of taking a nap myself.Fine.Systemsll watch our vitals anyway.Till later, then.Pleasant dreams.Fassin watched the screen show glantine drop away.Beyond it, revealed, was not initially the night of space or foamy wash of stars, but instead the broad, sunlit face of Nasqueron, a mad, swirling dance of gases the colour of some fabulous desert but moving in colossal ribbons like opposed streams of liquid around a globe a hundred and fifty thousand kilometres across, a planet you could drop a thousand glantines or Sepektes or Earths into and never notice the difference; a not so little system of its own within Ulubis system, a vast world that was almost as unlike home for any human as it was possible to imagine, and yet the place where Fassin had already spent most of his unusual, sporadically paced life, and so, for all its alien scale, wild magnetic and radiation gradients, extremes of temperature, crushing pressures, unbreathable atmosphere and dangerously, unpredictably eccentric inhabitants, it was for Fassin as it was for his fellow Seers, something like home after all.He watched until it too started to shrink, until glantine was a mere dot floating above its vast and banded ochre face, and the brighter stars appeared around it, then switched the screen off, and slept.He woke.Four hours had passed.The pressure was the same as it had been, the ship still roaring far away.He didnt need any more sleep, so he went into slowtime, just thinking.Everybody in Ulubis system knew where they were when the portal was destroyed.You knew because as soon as you heard you realised youd be staying in Ulubis for the next two and a half centuries at least.For most people, even the vast majority  ninety nine per cent of them human  who would never have the chance to travel out of system, that meant something profound.It meant that they were here for the rest of their lives.No dream theyd ever had or hope theyd entertained about seeing the rest of the galaxy would ever be reflected in reality.For others, it meant that loved ones, elsewhere in the rest of the galaxy, on the far side of the vanished portal, were for ever gone.Two hundred and fourteen years to Zenerre: over two centuries for light and therefore any sort of message or signal to travel from there to Ulubis; maybe three centuries before the wormhole link was re established, even if the Engineers set out from there with a portal carrying ship almost immediately.And who was truly to know if there were any Engineers or great ships left?Perhaps the Ulubis portal had not been alone, and all the rest had been attacked and destroyed at the same time.Maybe the Mercatoria itself was no more, maybe there was no Complex, no more Arteria and no more portals left anywhere and all that remained of the galaxys latest great civil isation were umpteen thousand separate little island systems, fractured and abandoned and alone.The usual wash of through portal comms traffic just before the destruction had betrayed no hint of such a galaxy wide attack.But then, there had been no hint more than ten minutes before of an attack on the Ulubis portal either, until the biggest fleet of Beyonder craft Ulubis had ever seen had swung glittering out of empty nowhere, throwing themselves against the single greatest concentration of ships and firepower anywhere in the system, being obliterated in their hundreds, but  effectively ignoring the defending ships except where they were directly in their way  pummelling and battering their way through defensive screen after defensive screen, oblivious to harm, straight towards the portal mouth itself, finally erasing everything around them in a flurry of immense antimatter explosions that alone announced to the system the scale and violence of what had taken place, creating a vanishingly brief cluster of novae in the facing skies of every inhabited surface, casting shadows far away, blinding those nearer to and vaporising most of what was still left of the Beyonder fleet and many of their pursuers.For a short while it looked as though they had failed, because the last line of defence had held and the portal had survived.The entire attack up to that point had been a feint, and the real assault took place when a large ship  a few million tonnes of hollowed out asteroid travelling at over ninety nine per cent of the speed of light  flicked in from the opposite direction.In a sense, it missed too, darting past the portal mouth a hundred metres away and colliding with a collection of laser battlesats which hadnt even started to turn towards it when it smashed into them, instantly annihilating them, the entire portal surround, its sub units and almost all its associated systems and creating another stunning detonation of light in the sky.None of which destroyed the portal; that was done by the relativistic mass of the sacrificed ship itself.Portals were only ever positioned at Lagrange points or other orbits distant from large heavenly bodies because they needed a section of space time that was relatively flat.Too great a gradient  too near the gravity well of a planet or other large object  and they stopped working.Increase the S T curve only a little more and they imploded and disappeared altogether, usually violently.The hurtling asteroid ship was so massive and its velocity so close to light speed that it had the same apparent mass as a planet the size of Sepekte.The passing of its gravity well so close to the portal mouth, especially at that extreme velocity, was sufficient to collapse the portal and the hole beyond, sending one more cataclysmic pulse of light flashing throughout the system.The last few of the earlier attackers immediately fled but were either destroyed or were disabled and then self destructed.Two days before the attack took place, Fassin had been sort of in space, sort of on Sepekte, sitting in a revolving restaurant at the summit of the Borquille Equatower having dinner with Taince Yarabokin, who was due to head back to the Summed Fleet Academy the following day after an extended compassionate leave following the death of her mother.Fassin had just come out of a month long trawl through some of the seedier, less salubrious entertainment palaces of skem, Sepektes second city.He felt jaded.Old, even.He and Taince had kept in touch since the incident in the ruined ship, though theyd never become especially close, despite a night spent together shortly afterwards.Saluus had kind of drifted away from both of them subsequently, then headed off early to a finishing college half the galaxy away, then spent decades being a problem playboy son to his vexed father  behaving more or less continually on a galactic scale the way Fassin did only intermittently on a systemic one  and returning to Ulubis very occasionally for brief, unannounced visits.A Guard Rescue suborb had arrived at the ruined ship lying crumpled on glantines North Waste Land a few minutes behind the Navarchy craft Taince had summoned.Its personnel had entered the alien ship and found Ilens broken body.There was an inquiry.Sal was fined by the civil authorities for violating the ships interior more than had been strictly required for the purposes of physical sanctuary from the external threat, while the Navarchy Military had awarded Taince extra course credits for her actions.Fassin found himself copping for some sort of civil bravery award thanks to Tainces testimony but managed to avoid the ceremony.He never did mention the piece of twisted metal that Sal had stolen from the wreck, but Taince had broached the subject herself over dinner in the Equatower.Shed known at the time, she just hadnt found herself capable of being bothered enough to take it off Sal again.Let him have his pathetic trophy.Probably their equivalent of a door knob or a coat hook, she said ruefully.But one gets you ten, by the time it was sitting in Sals locker or on his desk it was the ships control yoke or the main armament fire button.Taince looked out at the distant horizon and near surface of Sepekte, sliding past as the restaurant revolved, providing the appearance of gravity in this gravity cancelled habitat, anchored at the space limit of a forty kilo klick cable whose other end fell to ground in Borquille, Sepektes capital city.Shit, you knew all the time, Fassin said, nodding.I suppose I should have expected that.Not much ever got past you.Taince had gone on to become a high flier in every sense, carving a perfect career through the Navarchy Military and being chosen for the Summed Fleet, one of the Mercatorias highest divisions and one into which very few humans had ever been invited.Commander Taince Yarabokin looked young, had aged well.The three of them had.Sal, despite his multifarious debaucheries, could afford the very best treatments and plausibly access some supposedly forbidden to him, so he looked like hed lived through a lot fewer of the hundred and three years which had actually elapsed since Ilens death.Lately there was even a rumour that he was thinking of settling down, becoming a good son, learning the business, applying himself.Taince had spent decades at close to light speed pursuing the Beyonders craft and attacking their bases, fighting quickly, ageing slowly.Fassin had joined the family firm and become a Slow Seer after all, so spent his own time expanded decades conversing with and gradually extracting information from the Dwellers of Nasqueron.Hed had, like Saluus, his own wild years, been a roaring lad ripping through the highs and dives of glantine, Sepekte and beyond, taking in a not so Grand Tour of his own round some of the supposedly civilised galaxys more colourful regions, losing money and illusions, gaining weight and some small amount of wisdom.But his indulgences had been on a smaller scale than Sals, he supposed, and certainly took place over a shorter timescale.Before too long he came home, sobered up and calmed down, took the training and became a Seer.He still had his wild interludes, but they were few and far between, if never quite enough of either for the taste of his uncle Slovius.Even in the millennia hallowed halls of Seerdom, he had kept on making waves, upsetting people.The trend over the last fifteen hundred years  the years of Uncle Sloviuss reign  had favoured virtual delving over the direct method.Virtual or remote delving meant staying comatose and closely cared for in a clinic clean Seer faculty complex on Third Fury, the close orbit moon riding barely above the outer reaches of Nasquerons hazy atmosphere, to communicate from there with the Dwellers beneath by a combination of high res NMR scanners, laser links, comms satellites and, finally, mechanical remotes which did the dirty dangerous bit, keeping close contact with the flights and flocks and pods and schools and individuals of the Dwellers themselves.Fassin had been a ringleader in a small rebellion, insisting, with a few other young Seers, on sliding into cramped arrowhead gascraft, breathing in gillfluid, accepting tubes and valves into every major orifice and surrendering body and fate to a little ship that contained the Seer, accepted the gees and poison and radiation and everything else and took him or her physically into the gas giants atmosphere, the better to earn the respect and confidence of the creatures who lived there, the better to do the job and learn the stuff.There had been deaths, setbacks, arguments, bannings and strikes, but eventually, largely on the back of unarguably better delving results and more raw data (unarguably better delving results in the sense that they were manifestly superior compared with what had gone before, not unarguably better in the sense that the old guard couldnt claim this would all have happened anyway if everybody had just stuck to their ways, which were probably what had really prompted this long overdue improvement in the first place) the youngsters had triumphed, and delving the hard way, Real Delving, hands metaphorically dirty, became the norm, not the exception.It was, anyway, more exciting, more risky but also so much more rewarding, more fun for the Seer concerned, as well as being more viewer friendly for those who chose to pick up the edited, distilled, time delayed feed that the more progressive Seer houses had been putting out to the entsworks for the last half millennium or so.You have made it into something like a sport, Slovius had said sadly one day, when he and Fassin had been fishing together in a dust boat on glantines Sea of Fines.It used to be more of the mind.Nevertheless, from being a steadfast, heels in critic of the whole Real Delve movement, Slovius, who had always been quick to seize any opportunity to advance the interests of his Sept, had become a sort of  appropriately  remote champion, supporting Fassin and eventually putting the full weight of Sept Bantrabal behind him and his fellow revolutionaries.That both Fassin and Slovius had been right, and their Sept flourished to become arguably the most productive and respected of the twelve Septs of Ulubis system  and so by implication one of the foremost Seer houses in the galaxy  had been the single most satisfying achievement of Sloviuss time as Chief Seer and paterfamilias of Sept Bantrabal.Fassin was now arguably the best known Seer in the system, especially after his time with the Tribe Dimajrian, the wild pod of adolescent Dwellers hed befriended and effectively become part of for a seeming century and a real half dozen years.He was not yet even at the start of his prime by Seer reckoning but was nevertheless already at the top of his game.He had been born three hundred and ninety years earlier, had lived barely forty five of those in body time, and looked a decade younger.Sometimes he thought back to what had happened in the ruined alien ship, and he looked at all that had happened to Sal and Taince and himself, and reflected that it was as though they had all come away from that nightmare with a sort of bizarre blessing, an inverted curse, a trio of charmed lives, quite as if Ilen had unknowingly given up whatever golden future had awaited her to add that weight of divided bounty to theirs.He and Taince parted with a kiss.She was heading to the portal and through the Complex to the far side of the galaxy, to the Fleet Academy to spend a year passing on her knowledge.Fassin was going to the far side of Ulubis, where Nasqueron was at the time, to continue trying to extract knowledge from the Dwellers.Taince was safely through the portal a day before it was destroyed.Fassin was on a liner, a day out of Sepekte.He understood even as the news was still coming in that he might never see her again.Sal, who might so easily have been away, was at home with his long suffering father when the attack took place.After ten catatonic hours of disbelief he spent a month mourning his lost freedoms, trying to sink, fumigate and fuck his sorrows away in what passed for the pleasure pits of Ulubis.In fact, Sepekte, and especially Borquille, had perfectly disrespectable bars, smoke houses and bordellos  Borquille had a whole district, Boogeytown, set aside for just such recreations  but the point was they were not the rest of the civilised galaxy.Fass had bumped into Saluus in a Boogeytown spike bar once, though Sal had been so out of it that he hadnt recognised his one time friend.Then Sal straightened out, cut his hair, lost a few tattoos and a lot of acquaintances and at the start of the next working week turned up bang on time at the company offices, where people were still running around in a frenzy, spooked by all the numerous false alarms, expecting to be invaded at any moment.Right from the start, the questions were: Why?Why us?What next?And: Anybody else?Had something like this happened everywhere?It would take over two centuries for Ulubis to discover if it was part of a wider catastrophe or had been singled out for its own specific disaster.From being no more remote than any other system at the end of a single wormhole  and so orders of magnitude less remote than the many hundreds of thousands of Faring systems still to be connected or reconnected  Ulubis, its principal planet Sepekte, its three significant inhabited moons including glantine, its thousands of artificial habitats and the twenty billion souls that the whole system contained were fully as remote and exposed as theyd always seemed from any casual glance at a galactic star chart.The Guard, Navarchy Military and surviving units of the Ulubis Ambient Squadron repaired and regrouped.Martial law was declared and a War Emergency Plan actioned which turned the bulk of the systems advanced productive capacity to weapons and war craft.As a consequence, Kehar Heavy Industries, Saluuss fathers company, expanded and prospered beyond its founders most avaricious fantasies, and Saluus went from wastrel heir to a great fortune to inheritor in waiting of a vast one.In the system hierarchy, thought was given at the highest levels to attempting to construct a wormhole of Ulubiss own and a carrier fleet to take one end of it to Zenerre.But aside from the vast cost and the point  assuming a portal would be heading in the other direction before too long  that it would be a waste of time and effort which would bring reconnection no quicker, there was one clinching argument that would apply until either no signal arrived from Zenerre or word came of an utter breakdown in civil society: in the Mercatoria only Engineers were allowed to make and emplace wormholes.There were sanctions and punishments for those systems and rulers who even began a hole creation programme without explicit permission, and that permission had not been present in the Mercatorias pre agreed War Emergency Plan for Ulubis.Back in space, distributed around the Lagrange point where the portal had lain, the few pieces of recovered Beyonder ships indicated that the portals attackers had been made up from the same three groups which had troubled Ulubis and some of the nearby volumes for thousands of years: Transgress, the True Free and the BiAlliance, for this one occasion working in concert and in far greater numbers than they ever had before.Anxious, on edge, waiting for whatever a Beyonder invasion might bring, the people of the system reverted to a state something more like that of Earths rHumanity before it had been fully brought into the galactic community.It was a truism that all civilisations were basically neurotic until they made contact with everybody else and found their place within the ever changing meta civilisation of other beings, because, until then, during the stage when they honestly believed that they might be entirely alone in existence, all solo societies were possessed of both an inflated sense of their own importance and a kind of existential terror at the sheer scale and apparent emptiness of the universe.Even knowing that the rest of the galactic community did exist  at least in some form, even in a worst case  the culture of Ulubis system shifted fractionally towards that earlier, pre ascensionary state.Restricted by martial law in new and annoying but sometimes oddly exciting ways, coming to terms with their sudden isolation and newly appreciated vulnerability, people lived more for the short term, clutching at what pleasures and rewards might be available today, just in case there really was no tomorrow.No great breakdown in society took place and there were no significant riots or rebellions, though there were protests and crack downs, and, as the authorities admitted much later  much later  Mistakes Were Made.But the system held together rather than fell apart, and many people would look back on that strange, unsettled epoch with a sort of nostalgia.There had been something feverish but vivid about the time, a reconnection with life after the disconnection with everybody else, which led to what even looked from some angles suspiciously like a cultural renaissance for what people were now starting to call the Ulubine Disconnect.Fassin missed out on most of the excitement, taking every opportunity he could to go delving, as if frightened that he might not be able to do so in the future.Even when he was living back in real time he was insulated from the extremes of the system wide turmoil of fear and nervous energy by being on glantine rather than Sepekte or its ring habitats, then by living within the Sept, at one of its five seasonal houses, rather than in Pirrintipiti or any of the planet moons other major cities.He still travelled, spending occasional holidays in Pirri or off glantine, and that was when he felt the strange new atmosphere of freneticism most keenly.Mostly, though, he was in Nasqueron, nestled in a fragile little gascraft, occasionally at normal life speed, flying with the younger Dwellers, riding the gases alongside them, buffeted by the gas giant girdling, planet swallowing super winds and whirling hyper storms of the planet, sometimes  more often and much more productively, though far less excitingly : floating sedately in a study or a library in one of the millions of Dweller cities with one of the more elderly and scholarly Dwellers, who alone in the system seemed perfectly unconcerned about the portals demise.A few of the (rare) polite ones expressed the sort of formal shame but there you go sympathy people tend to exhibit when an acquaintances elderly relative expires peacefully, but that was about it.Fassin supposed that it was foolish to expect anything else from a race that was as ancient as the Dwellers claimed to be, who had supposedly explored the galaxy several times over at velocities of only a few per cent of light speed long before the planetary nebula that gave birth to Earth, Jupiter and the Sun had even formed out of the debris of still more antique generations of stars, and who still maintained they felt vaguely restricted not by that absolute limit on the conventional pace of travel but rather by the modest scale of the galaxy that these staggeringly long ago, almost wilfully leisurely sets of voyages had revealed.The days, weeks and months of waiting and preparation for an invasion became a year.The Beyonder attacks, rather than increasing, faded away almost to nothing, as though the portal assault had been one last insane hurrah rather than the logical, if wasteful, precursor to a war of conquest.The years added up towards a decade and gradually people and institutions relaxed and came to believe that the invasion might never come.The majority of the emergency powers lapsed, though the armed forces remained in high numbers and on high alert, sensors and patrols sweeping the volumes of space around Ulubis, seeking a threat that seemed to have disappeared.In four directions lay almost empty intergalactic nothingness: barren volumes holding a few ancient, exhausted cinder suns with life free systems or none at all, a scattering of dust and gas clouds, brown dwarfs, neutron stars and other debris  some of these, or the space in between, technically life supporting for Slow exotics, Cincturia and Enigmatics, but patently devoid of any species who cared or could even understand the fate or concerns of the people of Ulubis  but no allies, no one to help or offer assistance or support, and certainly no portal connections.Down arm, nearly parallel with the galaxys wispy limit, heading into the thickening mass of gas and nebulae and stars, was Zenerre.Inwards, between Ulubis and the galactic centre spread a vast mass of Disconnect; the Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect, millions of stars spread throughout cubic light centuries which, it was believed, still supported worlds that had once been part of the civilised, connected, hole networked galactic community until over seven thousand years earlier and the Arteria Collapse which had preceded the War of the New Quick and all the excitement and the woes that had flowed from it.* * *  Two centuries, one decade, four years and twenty days after the portal attack, exactly when it might have been expected, the first signal arrived from Zenerre, the wavefront of what would become a constant stream of information from the rest of the connected galaxy.Where, Ulubis was informed, life was going on as usual.The attack on its portal had been unique, and all was basically well with the Mercatoria.Attacks and incursions by the various Beyonder groups continued throughout the civilised galaxy, as did operations against them, but these were on the usual mainly nuisance value level that the Beyonder Wars had evidenced for thousands of years, the tactically distressing and annoyingly wasteful but strategically irrelevant distributed background micro violence that people had started calling the Hum.Relief, puzzlement and a vague sense of victimisation spread throughout Ulubis system.The Engineership Est taun Zhiffir, portal carrying, set out from Zenerre for Ulubis less than a year after the disaster, with a travel time initially given as 307 years, later reduced by increments to level out at 269 as the Eship upped its velocity even closer to light speed, the Engineers aboard fine tuning the systems which insulated the hauled portal from the effects of its own and the ships relativistic mass.People in Ulubis system relaxed, the last vestiges of martial law were hidden away from public sight again.Those many born after the portals destruction wondered what it would be like to have a connection to the rest of the galaxy, to this semi mythical meta civilisation theyd heard so much about.The flip over point came, and Fassin was vaguely aware of it as the pressure on his chest and flesh and limbs faded away over the course of a few seconds, replacing that feeling of oppression with a sensation of sudden blood roaring bloatedness as his body struggled to cope with the change.He kept his eyes closed.Almost immediately there was a faint trace of force, a gentle push from somewhere beneath his head, then weightlessness again, and a few moments later a matching tug from somewhere beneath his feet, and then weight returning, pressure quickly building, until the roaring in his head faded and became the distant thunder of the ship again.* * *  The Archimandrite Luseferous, standing before the ruins of the city, stooped and dug gloved fingers into the soft earth by his feet, wrenching out a handful of soil.He held it to his face for a while, staring at it, then brought it close to his nose and smelled it, then let it fall and dusted off his gloves while staring down at the huge crater where a large part of the city had been.The crater was still filling from the sea, a slow curling curve of brown white water spilling from the estuary beyond.The waterfall disappeared into the seat of the crater in a vast cloud bank of vapour, and steam rose everywhere from the rolling, tumbling confusion of waters as the great rocky bowl cooled.A massive trunk of steam, three kilometres or more across, rose into the calm pastel sky, rolling up through thin layers of cloud, flat heading where it achieved the middle reaches of the atmosphere.It was the Archimandrites conceit, where a severe lesson had to be taught on a planet capable of supporting such a mark, that a city by the sea, which was either itself guilty of resisting or judged by him symbolic of resistance shown by others on the planet, be remade in the image of his beloved Junch City, back on Leseum9 IV.If a people would resist him, either while undergoing conquest or enduring occupation, they would suffer, of course, but they would be part of something greater at the same time and they would, even in death, even in the death of much of their city, be the unwitting and unwilling participants in what was, indeed, a work of art.For here, seen from this hillside, was there not a new Faraby Bay?Was that slot through which the waters thundered, shaking the ground, not another Force Gap?Was that piling tower of steam, first drawn straight up then stroked to the horizon, not a kind of signature, his very own flourish?The Bay was overly circular, certainly, and the slot a mere break in a modest crater wall composed largely of estuarine mud, presenting no aesthetic match at all for the great kilometre high cliffs of the real Force Gap  indeed, the whole setting for this new image of junch City entirely lacked the originals dramatic ring of surrounding mountains, and this little parkland hill on which he stood  with his admirals, generals and guard waiting obediently behind, allowing him this moment of reflection  was frankly a poor substitute for the vertical cliff of the Sheer Citadel and its magnificent views.Nevertheless, an artist had to work with what there was to hand, and where there had once been just another swarming seaside city, lying tipped upon the land, variously hilled, messily distributed round a tributary river, with the all usual urban sprawl, great buildings, docks, breakwaters and anchorages  in other words what it had always been, roughly, no matter that there had been earlier so called catastrophes like earthquakes or floods or great fires or bombardment from sea or air or earlier invasion  now there was an image of a fair and distant place, now there was a new kind of savage beauty, now there was a fit setting for a new city reborn in the image of his sovereignty, now there was a sort of  even  healing joining with those other peoples and places who had surrendered to his will, in suffering and in image, for this majestic crater, this latest work, was just the most recent of his creations, one more jewel on a string stretching back to the primacy of elegance that was Junch City.Anyone with sufficient self belief, enough ruthlessness and (Luseferous believed himself modest enough to admit) an adequate supply of luck could  if the will was there and the times required such determination  conquer and destroy.Judging how much to destroy for the effect one wished to achieve, knowing when to be ruthless, when to show leniency, even when to exhibit beguiling, rage sapping generosity and a touch of humour; that required a more measured, a more subtle, a more  he could think of no other word for it  civilised touch.He had that touch.The record spoke for itself.To then go on from there and use the sad necessity of destruction to create art, to form an image of a better place and forge symbolic unity that was on another level again, that elevated the mere war maker, the mere politician, to the status of creator.Tendrils of smoke rose all around the central column of steam, dark paltry vines adorning a huge pale trunk.These marked where defending aircraft had fallen and where fires had been started by the crater weapons ground shock, no doubt.Part of the artistry involved in such a work was creating a great declivity without utterly destroying all around it (a new, reborn city had to grow here, after all).Some sophistication of weaponry was required to achieve such precision.His armaments experts attended to such details.The Archimandrite Luseferous looked about him, smiling to his chiefs of staff, all standing respectfully at his heel, looking a little nervous to be here in the fresh air of another newly subject planet.(Yet was it not good to breathe in that fresh air, for all its alien scents?Did those strange new odours not themselves mean that another treasure had been added to their ever increasing domain?)Above and behind, bristling war craft hovered and hummed, attended by small clouds of sensory and weapon platforms.Spread in a ring all around were his personal guards, most lying or kneeling on the grass, their darkly glinting weaponry poised.A few in military exoskels lumbered around or squatted, splayed feet squashing into the earth.At the foot of the hill, beyond another ring of guards, beneath a watchful buzz of guard drones, the refugees moved like a slow river of dun and grey.Stilters; groundbats, whule.A Mercatorial species.Disconnected all these millennia, certainly, but still a Mercatorial species.Luseferous looked up into the pale green sky, imagining night, the veils of stars, and the one particular sun  pointed out to him from orbit just forty hours ago, while the invasion forces were being prepared for the initial drop  growing steadily closer as they crawled and fought their way towards it, which was called Ulubis.* * *  In the bright, golden hued air of Sepekte, with the Borquille Equatower a thin stem in the hazy distance, the little Navarchy ship approached the palace complex, sliding through an ancient forest of kilometres tall atmospheric power columns and between more modest but still impressive administration and accommodation towers.It disappeared into a wide, gently sloped tunnel set into the reception plaza in front of the enormous ball that was the palace of the Hierchon, an eight hundred metre sphere modelled after Nasqueron itself by a long departed Sarcomage, complete with individual bands of slowly contra rotating floors all sliding round a stationary inner core.Changing orange red, brown and ochre swirls of pattern, convincingly like the view of the distant gas giants cloud tops seen from space, moved across the face of the palace, hiding windows and balconies, sensors and transmitters.Major Taak?Lieutenant Inesiji, palace guard.This way, please.Quick as we can, sir.The speaker, whose voice sounded like a human child talking with a mouthful of ball bearings, was a jajuejein, a creature which in repose resembled an insectile tumbleweed sixty or seventy centimetres in diameter.This one had drawn itself up to Fassins two metre height, marshalling a host of twiglike components coloured dark green and steel blue to resemble a sort of openwork head like a birds nest  thankfully it had not tried to make a face  and had balanced itself on two vaguely leglike stalks.The rest of its body, offering glimpses of the reception caverns floor beyond, was just a cylinder, adorned with belts of soft looking material and small metallic components that might have been jewellery, gadgets or weapons.It half turned, half flowed to a small open cart where the ships whule rating was already depositing Fassins luggage.Fassin turned and waved to the groggily cheerful Dicogra, joined the jajuejein in the cart and was whisked away through a brief security reception area to a lift and a curving corridor which took him to a suite of rooms with what looked like a real outside view of the city  north, with pale, jagged hills in the far distance.Lieutenant Inesiji placed Fassins bags on the bed with fluid grace and informed him that he had exactly three fifths of an hour to freshen up, don his ceremonial court clothes and present himself outside his door, whereupon he would be escorted to the audience chamber.Fassin blipped a safe arrival message to Bantrabal and then did as hed been told.The circular audience chamber was glittering and warm, walls of white gold sparkling under a ceiling filling galaxy shaped cloud of tiny sharp lights impersonating stars.Lieutenant Inesiji showed Fassin to a position on one of the many platforms set into the shallow, stepped bowl of the chamber.A human conforming seat malleabled its way up from the floor.He sat in it  stiffly, in his bulky court robes  and the lieutenant told him, Please stay where you are for now, sir in a sort of gargled whisper, executed what might have been a bow, turned into what looked very like a cartwheel, and rolled away back up the slope of gangway to an exit.Fassin looked around.The chamber looked like it might hold a thousand people, but he was one of only about two dozen people present, distributed around the shallowly conical space as though to maximise the distance between each individual.Humans  all, like him, in cumbersome, rather gaudy court dress  just about outnumbered the others, but he saw another jajuejein  balled, either resting or sleeping, criss crossed with iridescent ribbons  two whule sitting like angular grey tents covered in silver flowers, both looking at him, a pair of quaup, one of the two metre long red tan ellipses floating and also looking at him (well, certainly pointing at him), and the other stood on its end, either also snoozing or possibly at attention  Fassins knowledge of alien body language was wide but shallow except where Dwellers were concerned.Three large environment suits containing waterworlders completed the non human contingent: two of the esuits, looking like aquamarine impersonations of the quaups, most likely contained kuskunde; the third was a matt black lozenge the size of a small bus, radiating warmth.That esuit would almost certainly contain an symbioswarm Ifrahile.In the centre of the chamber, at its deepest point, just before a set of wide, tall, concentric platforms which broke the symmetry of the space, there was an incongruous looking device which looked like an ancient iron cooking pot: a black bellied urn a couple of metres in diameter, capped with a shallow dome and sitting on a tripod of stubby legs on the buttery sheen of the solid gold floor.Its surface was pinstriped with thin vanes, but otherwise it resembled something almost prehistoric.Fassin had never seen anything like it before.He shivered, despite the warmth of the chamber.The quaup which might have been sleeping suddenly flicked level with a ripple of lateral mantle and turned towards its fellow creature thirty metres away, which swivelled to look back at it.Expression patterns flashed across their face nacelles, then they moved towards each other, hovering together, faces signal flickering conversation for the few seconds it took for a small flutter drone to drop from the ceiling and  in spoken voice, with chirps and squeaks  apparently ordered them back to their places.The quaup shriek popped back at the mechanical remote, but split up, drifting away to their earlier positions.They had just about resumed their allotted patches when a group of half a dozen jajuejein technicians, awkward in their shape constraining formal court gear of dimly iridescent ribbons, entered from a door at one side of the chamber floor, pushing large pallets full of highly techy looking equipment which they positioned in a rough circle round the cooking pot device.Their body ribbons marked them out as Shrievalty, Fassin suddenly realised, wondering whether as a major of the Ocula he was senior enough to order them around.A similar sized group  human Cessorian priests from their garb, though in their court best it was hard to be sure  could they even be Lustrals?approached from the opposite direction.The priests stood close behind the technicians, who ignored them and busied themselves setting up and adjusting their arcane apparatus.Finally, an alarming group of four human and four whule troopers in full mirror finish power armour stalked in, complete with a variety of heavy infantry weapons.The ambience of the chamber changed; even across species the mood almost tangibly altered from one of some puzzlement and a degree of expectation to one of alarm, even fear.The two quaup were exchanging rapid large scale face signals, the Ifrahile esuit rose hissing from its platform and the whule pair were alternating between staring at each other and glaring down at their mirror armoured kin.Who brought armed forces into an audience chamber?Was this a trap?Had all here offended the Hierchon?Were they all to be murdered?The soldiers deployed in a wide circle around the Shrievalty and Cessoria, standing at ease, weaponry poised, armour locked.They were facing inwards, towards the black cooking pot device.The mood in the room seemed to relax a little.Then the series of platforms beyond the giant urn and the various groups of functionaries shimmered once and dropped into the floor, to re emerge some moments later, crowded with people.An outer ring of white uniformed human court officials, an inner ring of species varied, extravagantly emblazoned courtiers and an outer core, again mixed species, of Ascendancy, Omnocracy, Administrata and Cessoria  Fassin recognised most of them from the news and the few formal visits hed had to make to the court over the years  formed semicircular tiers of importance around the being in the centre: the Hierchon Ormilla himself, resplendent in his giant platinum sheathed discus of an environment suit, floating humming just above the highest platform, the dark creatures great gaping face visible through the suits forward diamond window amongst roiling clouds of crimson gas.Seven metres high, three wide, the suit was by some margin the largest and most impressive of the micro environments in the chamber.It quickly took on a frosted look, as humidity in the air condensed on its deep chilled surfaces.As the Hierchon and his attendants appeared, Fassins seat gave a warning vibration and began to sink back into the platform beneath.Fassin took the hint and stood, then bowed, while the various other people in the chamber performed their equivalent actions.The giant esuit lowered fractionally so that its base touched the platform, and Fassins seat rose smoothly from the platform again.The Hierchon Ormilla was an oerileithe: a gas giant dweller, but  important distinction, this, to all concerned  not a Dweller, even if the shape of his esuit made him look like one.Ormilla had ruled the Ulubis system since his investiture nearly six thousand years earlier, long before the humans who now made up the bulk of its populace had arrived.He was generally thought to be a competent if unimaginative governor, exercising what leeway a Hierchon had within the Mercatorial system with caution, sense and, on occasion, even a degree of compassion.His rule since the portals destruction had, by the estimation of the officially sanctioned media, been a humbling combination of breathtaking majesty, heroic, utterly exemplary fortitude and a touching, steadfast solidarity with his human charges.Unkinder, unsanctioned, often human critics might have accused him of betraying an early disposition towards authoritarianism and even paranoid repression, eventually followed later by a more composed and lenient attitude, when he started listening to his advisers again.Looking more carefully at the high ups present, Fassin realised that, basically, the gang was all here.Apart from Ormilla himself, the Hierchons two most senior deputies, the Peregals Tlipeyn and Emoerte were in attendance, as was the most senior member of the Propylaea to survive the portals destruction, sub master Sorofieve, the top Navarchy officer, Fleet Admiral Brimiaice, Guard General Thovin, First Secretary Heuypzlagger of the Administrata, Colonel Somjomion of the Shrievalty  his own ultimate superior officer for the duration of the current emergency, Fassin supposed  and Clerk Regnant Voriel of the Cessoria.The absolute elite of the system.Fassin looked at the pot bellied stove device squatting on the golden floor, and at the heavily armed troopers, and thought what a perfect opportunity was presenting itself for a complete decapitation of the systems top brass.This is an extraordinary session of the Mercatorial Court of Ulubis, before the Hierchon Ormilla, an official announced over the chambers PA, voice thundering.The Hierchon Ormilla!the official shouted, as though concerned that people hadnt heard him the first time.The official was speaking the human version of Standard, the galaxys lingua franca.Standard had been chosen as an inter species, pan galactic language over eight billion years ago.Dwellers had been the main vector in its spread, though they made a point of emphasising that it was not theirs originally.They had one very ancient, informal vernacular and another even more ancient formal language of their own, plus lots that had survived somehow from earlier times or been made up in the meantime.These latter came and went in popularity as such things tended to.Oh no, there was a competition, the Dweller guide\mentor Ysul had explained to Fassin on his first delve, hundreds of years ago.Usual thing; lots of competing so called universal standards.There was a proper full scale war after one linguistic disagreement  a grumous and a pLiner species, if memory serves  and after that came the usual response: inquiries, missions, meetings, reports, conferences, summits.What we now know as Standard was chosen after centuries of research, study and argument by a vast and unwieldy committee composed of representatives of thousands of species, at least two of which became effectively extinct during the course of the deliberations.It was chosen, astonishingly, on its merits, because it was an almost perfect language: flexible, descriptive, uncoloured (whatever that means, but apparently its important), precise but malleable, highly, elegantly complete yet primed for external term adoption and with an unusually free but logical link between the written form and the pronounced which could easily and plausibly embrace almost any set of phonemes, scints, glyphs or pictals and still make translatable sense.Best of all, it didnt belong to anybody, the species which had invented it having safely extincted themselves millions of years earlier without leaving either any proven inheritors or significant mark on the greater galaxy, save this sole linguistic gem.Even more amazingly, the subsequent conference to endorse the decision of the mega committee went smoothly and agreed all the relevant recommendations.Take up and acceptance were swift and widespread.Standard became the first and so far only true universal language within just a few Quick mean generations.Set a standard for pan species cooperation that everybodys been trying to live up to ever since.Which is not to say that everybody everywhere loves it without qualification.Amongst my own species in particular, resistance to its use continues to this day, and individual obsessives and small and indeed quite large groups and networks of enthusiasts are forever coming up with new and, they claim, even better universal languages.Some Dwellers persist in regarding Standard as an outrageous alien imposition and a symbol of our craven surrender to galactic fashion.Such persons tend to speak ancient formal.Or at least they do where they havent invented their own unique and generally utterly incomprehensible language.Uncle Slovius himself, on what, fittingly, had turned out to be his final delve, had accompanied Fassin on this, the young mans first.How perfectly typical, hed observed later.Only Dwellers could have a completely fair competition eight billion years ago and still be arguing over the result.Fassin smiled at the thought and looked round the giant auditorium as the officials words echoed and faded amongst the precious metals and sumptuous clothing.He thought it was all very impressive, in a slightly camp, almost vulgar way.He wondered how much tedious ceremony and baroque speechifying they would now have to sit through before anything of note happened or was said.He did a quick count of the bodies in the chamber.There were well over twice the thirty that the emissarial projection had told him to expect.A tap screen appeared on a stalk out of the platform surface and positioned itself in front of him, flicking into life with search and note facilities enabled, but no audio or visual record.Fassin tapped a symbol to confirm that he was there.Round the circular chamber, the others were also being presented with screens or their species relevant alternative.You are here to witness the transmission of a signal from the Engineership Est taun Zhiffir, Ormillas deep, synthesised voice said calmly.We are informed that it is, of necessity, in the form of an Artificial Intelligence construct which will be destroyed after the audience has finished.Ormilla paused, to let this sink in.Fassin thought he just hadnt heard right.How you use the information you are about to learn is a matter of duty and conscience, Ormilla told them.How you came by it is not; any revelation regarding the signals form is punishable by death.Begin.An AI?A conscious machine?An abomination?Were they serious?Fassin couldnt believe it.The entire history of the Mercatoria was the record of its implacable persecution and destruction of AIs and the continual, laborious, zealously pursued effort to prevent them ever again coming into existence within the civilised galaxy.That was what the Lustrals were all about; they were the AI hunters, the remorseless, fanatic persecutors of machine intelligence and any and all research into it, and yet here they were, calmly watching the cooking pot device and the technicians surrounding it.A semi transparent image flickered in the air above the dark machine in the centre of the chamber.The hologram was of a human male dressed in the uniform of an Admiral of the Summed Fleet.Fassin hadnt even known that one of his species had risen to such impressive heights.The human admiral was an old, well built man with a heavily lined face.Bald, of course, but sporting a heavily tattooed scalp.He wore, or his image appeared to wear, a high rank space combat suit, its helmet components in stowed configuration round the neck and shoulders.Various insignia on the surface of the suit confirmed with no discernible subtlety that the Admiral was an extremely important military person.Thank you, Hierchon Ormilla, the image said, then seemed to look straight at Fassin, who felt startled for a moment before realising that the image probably appeared to be looking directly at everybody in the chamber.He certainly hoped so.I represent Admiral Quile of the Summed Fleet, commanding the Third Medium Squadron of the battle fleet accompanying the Engineership Est taun Zhiffir on its journey towards Ulubis system, Fleet Admiral Kisipt commanding, the projection said in a calm, no nonsense voice.Battle fleet?thought Fassin.You didnt send a battle fleet to accompany an Eship, portal carrying or not, did you?They usually travelled with a few Guard ships or one or two units of the Navarchy Military plus a single small Summed Fleet craft sometimes for ceremonial purposes.He was no military expert, but even he knew this sort of stuff, just from catching newscasts of at the time recent connections and reconnections.He watched the military on the semicircular podia closely.Yep, looked like they were startled by this news, too.I am to dispense information, and orders, the hologram said.Then I will answer questions.Then I will be destroyed.Information first.Intelligence we have received strongly indicates that Ulubis system will, probably within a year and possibly within months of this signal reaching you, become the target of a full scale invasive assault originating from the Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect.The hologram paused, appearing to listen.There was a certain sense of stillness, even of shock in the chamber, but no gasps or expressions of fear or incredulity that Fassin could hear.He scanned the people in the chamber, trying to work out if he was the only person present to whom this news might come as a surprise.Face flickers from the quaup, big staring looks between the whule, perhaps a few rather wide eyed expressions amongst the tech people down near the dark AI machine.Some of the more readable courtiers looked a little stunned.The Ifrahile esuit might have wobbled fractionally.Fassins hand was moving towards the tap screen when it lit up with a diagram of the galactic local volume, about a thousand years in diameter and centred on Cluster Epiphany Five, the millions strong mass of stars core in from the isolated wisp of suns near the end of which lay Ulubis.Indeed, our strategists put at about six per cent the possibility that by the time this signal arrived the invasion would already have happened.The hologram looked around the chamber and smiled.I am glad to see that is not the case.The smile disappeared.On the other hand I had hoped, when the original of this signal was recorded, that I would be telling you that the invasion was still three to five years away.Since becoming embodied here Ive been given access to some of the real time intelligence youve been gathering and have had no choice but to plump for an estimate that gives you even less time to prepare than wed been hoping for.The image paused briefly.The E 5 Discon was already known to be expanding aggressively.Deep space monitors have been picking up blossoming eighth power level weapon blink for several hundred years, centred on the Leseum systems.The image looked around the chamber.Space battles and high megatonne nukes, in other words.All the signs are of a rogue hegemony, possibly under the thrall of a human calling himself the Archimandrite Luseferous.He was once genuinely of the Cessoria, though at the rank of Hariolator, not Archimandrite, so it would appear hes promoted himself.In any case, I think we may now count him apostate.The hologram smiled thinly.The Leseum systems were until not all that long ago the last remaining connected part of the Epiphany Five region.However, that wormhole portal fell victim to a minor action of the Strew, leaving the whole volume completely cut off from civilisation.The thin smile faded.Ten days ago from the time this signal was sent an invasion force out of the E 5 Discon comprising several hundred capital ships plus retinue and troop carriers attacked the Ruanthril system, inward from the E 5 Cluster.We assume it came as a surprise to them that Ruanthril had just received a new portal and been connected to the Mercatoria.It had not been part of the Complex before, which may help explain their miscalculation.In any event, elements of the Summed Fleet were present when the E 5 forces attacked.The attack was beaten off, with heavy losses on both sides.At this, Fassin saw a look of something that certainly seemed like consternation pass over the face parts of the Fleet Admiral Brimiaice.Yes, the image said, as though responding.We were surprised too, frankly, and just had insufficient ships.Even more distressingly, the portal was subsequently destroyed.Here, Fleet Admiral Brimiaice, a quaup, assumed the blank face of  if Fassin recalled his Facial [or equivalent] Expressions and Body Language of Mercatorial Species 101 course  vicariously shamed shock.Before that happened, the hologram continued, intelligence from the captured enemy flagship was transmitted into the Complex.It included a personal record belonging to their equivalent of a Grand Admiral  the invasion fleets Supreme Commander  in which he recorded for posterity or his memoirs his puzzlement that so much of the vast military machine of which he was so proud to be a part was being directed not where it would carry the most weight or help capture the greatest number of systems in the shortest possible time  in other words, towards where the greatest mass of stars were, spin ward, back, up, down and especially core ward  but away from those regions, towards the almost empty galactic outskirts, towards the Southern Tendril Reefs, towards Stream Quaternary and the Ulubis system, or the shit nailed anus probing finger at the end of a withered arm, as he colourfully described it.Fassin nearly laughed.Most of the officials on the main ceremonial platforms, led by the humans, registered shock, horror or outrage in some form.The Hierchons esuit rolled back half a metre, as though physically struck.The image took its time to look around the chamber.Yes, unflattering.My apologies.You will be happy to know that the gentleman who was the source of this memorable image is currently helping the Combined Forces Intelligence Inquisitariat with its inquiries.Fassin watched a few slightly forced expressions of satisfaction appear.They really didnt know any of this before, he thought.Hed assumed the Hierchon and his chums would have been granted some sort of sneak preview earlier, but this seemed to be as new to them as it was to him.We also, of course, have the pre invasion probing sequence profile for the E 5 Discons attempted conquest of Ruanthril, the hologram said, plus those of several other systems attacked by the same force mix.The musings of the invasion fleets commander provide credible reason to believe Ulubis is under significant threat.The comparison of the pre attack probing sequence profile for Ruanthril with the recent raids on and other hostile actions within Ulubis system leads to the conclusion that said threat is imminent, within the time frame of a few months to less than a year and a half.There is a long accepted, high consistency Beyonder attack profile, and the aggressions Ulubis system has been experiencing over the last three years are anomalous to that.Fassin suspected that this was a subtle criticism of the system intelligence and strategy services, and especially the Navarchys.Fleet Admiral Brimiaice looked unnaturally still, as though trying not to draw any unnecessary attention to himself.The information also pointed to something of a cover up.Like Verpych, Fassin had thought these anomalous attacks had begun just over a year ago; this AI had been given access to information indicating that they had been going on for two years before that.Well, that would come as no surprise to anyone.Being spoon fed rosy hued misinformation by the authorities was no more than people had come to expect  and pre emptively discount.They only got suspicious when presented with what looked like the plain unvarnished truth.I do have more to say, the image above the cooking pot device told the assembled listeners.However, I sense that some of you are already anxious to ask questions, and so at this point I would like to invite queries regarding what you have heard so far.No need to introduce yourselves, by the way  I know who you all are.Everybody looked at the Hierchon, who obligingly boomed, Machine, what percentage of likelihood pertains to this invasion?The hologram did not look particularly impressed with this first question.It might even have sighed.Fassin only half listened to the answer and paid even less attention to the following questions and answers; none of them added anything significant to what hed already heard and mostly the questions boiled down to the categories: Are you sure?Are you mad?Are you lying, abomination?And, I wont get blamed for any of this, will I?He used the tap screen to get a better idea of the relevant galactic topography.He called up a usefully scaled hologram and flicked between the local civilisational state of play as it had been understood until today  effectively two and a half centuries out of date  and the updated version that the AI signal had brought with it, which was only seventeen years old.As he did so, whole vast volumes of stars changed from one false colour to another, indicating where this Cluster Epiphany Five Disconnect hegemony had spread its influence.Resist them with all our might!Fleet Admiral Brimiaice roared.Im sure you will, the hologram said.However, all the indications are that even if you devoted yourself to all out, full time emergency war craft construction and a full war economy, you will still be outnumbered several times over.Fleet Admiral Brimiaice then blustered.Fassin had a question of his own, but it was a question for inside his own head, not one that he wished to ask the AI.It was a question he had the unpleasant feeling would at some point shortly be answered, though he sincerely hoped it wouldnt.It was: What the hell does all this have to do with me?May I continue?the image said after the next few contributions showed unmistakable signs of heading in the direction of becoming not so much questions as attestations of innocence, pledges of heroic determination, position protection statements and attacks on other functionaries present within a wide spectrum of subtlety, biased towards the low end.The hologram gave a small, thin, regretful smile.I realise that all the foregoing has come as something of a shock, for all of you.However, it is, I am afraid to say, in effect just a preamble to the most significant part of this communication.The image of Admiral Quile paused to let that sink in, too.Then the hologram said, Now then.There is a gentleman amongst you who has no doubt been wondering for some little time what exactly he is doing here.Oh, shit, Fassin had time to think, then the image looked at him.Was it really looking at him now?Could everybody see the hologram looking at him?Heads, or other parts as appropriate, turned in his direction.That probably meant yes.Seer Fassin Taak, would you make yourself known to the others?Fassin heard the blood roar in his ears as he stood and gave a slow, if shallow, bow towards the Hierchon.He was getting that flesh shrinking thing again.The chamber looked to be tipping, and he was glad to sit down again.He tried to control the blush that he felt building under his throat.Seer Taak is a young man, though born centuries ago, the image said.He has spent a productive and dutiful career with the gas giant Dwellers of the planet Nasqueron.I understand that many of you may have heard of him already.He has now been given the rank of major within the Shrievalty Ocula, for reasons which will become clear in due course.Fassin, still feeling very much looked at, noticed that Colonel Somjomion, the human female who was acting chief of staff of the Shrievalty contingent in the Ulubis system, smiled cautiously at him from the podium across the chamber when the holo gram said this.Unsure whether the Shrievalty saluted or not, Fassin rose fractionally in his seat, and nodded formally.Oh, fuck, were his precise thoughts.The image floating above the cooking pot AI said, The reason that Seer  Major  Taak is here today to hear what I have had to tell you all is that it was something which he discovered  stumbled over might be an equally accurate description, with no disrespect to Seer Taak  that has led to my being here in the first place.Oh, fucking hell.I always thought delving would be the death of me but I assumed it would be an equipment failure, not something like this.On the other hand, that smile from Colonel Somjomion had been restrained, even careful, not mean or mocking.Might live yet.Which brings us, of course, to the real, or at least the most pressing, reason for my appearance here, in this almost unprecedented form, the hologram said, then made a show of taking a deep breath.It looked around them all, slowly, before saying, Ulubis, Im sure we would all agree, is a pleasant and fairly favoured system.It paused again.Fassin was listening fairly hard at this point, and would have taken decent odds on the literal truth of the old you could have heard a pin drop saying.And, the projection said with a smile, radiantly confident that it now had their full attention, as a centre of Dweller Studies, it is not without significance galactically, unquestionably from an antiquarian and intellectual standpoint.Another pause.It occurred to Fassin that an AI controlling a hologram could put a quite literal twinkle in its eye.However, one might think it reasonable to ask  again, with no disrespect intended, or, I hope, taken  why Ulubis has attracted the attention of our new found adversaries from Cluster Epiphany Five.One might even  knowing the importance that the Mercatoria attaches to reconnecting all the many, many systems which have been without Arteria access all these millennia  wonder why the expedition from Zenerre to Ulubis with a new portal was dispatched with such alacrity, given the arguably still greater claims that more populous, more classically strategically important and more at the time obviously threatened systems might have had upon the resources and expertise of our esteemed colleagues in the Engineering faculty.One might also pause to give thought to the reasons why the Engineership Est taun Zhiffir is accompanied by those elements of the Summed Fleet of which my original has the honour of being part  why, indeed, the Eship Est taun Zhiffir is escorted by such a preponderance of force at all.The hologram raised its head, looked all around again.It might not even be totally unreasonable to call into question the apparently unchallenged assumptions and settled conclusions concerning the destruction of the Ulubis portal by the Beyonders, over two centuries ago.That caused a little frisson in the chamber, Fassin noticed.Is any of this still about me and anything I might have found?he wondered.The more I hear, the more I hope it isnt.There is one circumstance, one nexus of contingent information, the image said with a broad, unamused smile and something like relish, which is, we strongly suspect, behind all of this.The projection turned to look directly at the Hierchon Ormilla.Sir, at this point I must ask that those not specifically cleared to be present at this meeting be withdrawn.I believe we might make an exception for the troopers, providing their ear mikes are turned off, but I would be disobeying my orders if I continued with those not invited still present.Admiral Quile, the Hierchon boomed, with just sufficient emphasis, I vouch for all those present who were inadvertently excluded from the clearance list you refer to.You may continue.And were it up to me, sir, that would of course be more than enough reason to proceed without care or reservation, the Admirals image said.However, devastated though I may be at being seen to offer even the slightest suggestion of an insult to your esteemed court, I am specifically forbidden to continue, bound as I am by the orders of the Complector Council.Ouch, Fassin thought.He almost felt sorry for the Hierchon.Hed not just had rank pulled on him, hed been made to look small.A Sarcomage outranked a Hierchon, and was in turn answerable to a Complector, any single one of which : supremely powerful as they were in every other exercise and iteration of power within the civilised galaxy  themselves had at least to take into account the will of the Complector Council.The unspeakably omnipotent members of the Complector Council were bound by nothing else save the laws of physics, and were generally held to be putting considerable effort into getting round those.Hierchon Ormilla took his defeat with a degree of grace and within a few minutes the chamber was emptied of half its earlier occupants.The stepped sequence of podia in front of the Hierchons imposing esuit now looked positively bare.All the court officials and courtiers had departed, with much muttering and the single highest quotient of affronted dignity Fassin had ever witnessed, by several factors.The military bigwigs were still present, but even their on podium ranks had been depleted as Colonel Somjomion of the Shrievalty and Clerk Regnant Voriel of the Cessoria were reduced to stepping down to floor level so that they could operate the two most important pieces of equipment monitoring the cooking pot device embodying the AI.The mirror finish troopers still stood in a wide circle beyond, armour locked in at ease, deaf now.While all this had been going on, Fassin had been left to sit there, not knowing what to think.He knew what he ought to be thinking; he ought to be thinking, What the fuck could I ever have stumbled across that possibly warranted this level of right to the top paranoia and secrecy?It was, however, hard to know what to think.He also knew what he ought to feel: fear.There, he was fine; he had a superabundance of high weapon grade trepidation.Thank you, the image of the Admiral said.Now then, it said, looking round all those who remained.I have a question for you.What do you know of something called the Dweller List?It held up one hand.Rhetorical question.You dont have to answer.Those of you who wish, feel free to consult your screens or equivalent.Take a moment.There was a flurry of distant tapping.The Dweller List?thought Fassin.Oh, fucking hell; not that shit.The hologram smiled.Let me in due time tell you what we at this end  as we design and record this signal and projection  consider important regarding this subject.Fassin had heard of the Dweller List, of course; no Seer hadnt.Unfortunately, lots of laypeople had heard of the List, too, and so it had become one of those tired, inward groan producing subjects that people tended to raise when they met a Seer at a party, along with other hoary old clich questions such as, Do Dwellers really hunt their own children?and, Are they really as old as they say they are?The Dweller List was a collection of coordinates.It had turned up, as far as anyone could be sure, towards the end of the Burster War four hundred million years earlier, and was probably well out of date even then.Allegedly, the list detailed all the Dwellers own secret arteria portals.According to the story, these had been under development since the time of the Long Collapse, when the Dwellers had decided that the other species  or groups of species  with which they were forced to share the galaxy couldnt be trusted to keep their own or jointly owned hole networks safe, and so the Dwellers had better construct an arteria web which they controlled  and which preferably nobody else knew about  if they wanted to voyage from gas giant to gas giant reliably and without fuss.This, of course, completely ignored the Dwellers attitudes to time and space and scale and more or less everything else.The Dwellers didnt need wormholes and the near instantaneous travel between systems that they offered.They lived for billions of years, they could slow their metabolism and thoughts down as required so that a journey of a thousand years or ten thousand years or a hundred thousand years would appear to be over in the course of a single sleep, or occupied no more time than that required to read a good book, or play a complicated game.Plus they were already everywhere; they claimed they had spread throughout the galaxy during the First Diasporian Age, which had ended when the universe was only two and a half billion years old.Even if that claim was a boast, a typical Dweller exaggeration, what was undeniable was that Dwellers were present in significant numbers in well over ninety nine per cent of all the gas giant planets in the galaxy, and had been for as long as anybody could remember.(Though not, as it had turned out, Jupiter.Humanitys own backyard gas giant was unusual in being relatively water poor.The Dwellers considered it a desert planet and rarely visited. )After centuries of real time and decades of seem time spent with Dwellers, Fassin had gained the distinct impression that Dwellers both despised and felt sorry for the Quick  the species, like humans, like all the others in the Mercatoria, which felt the need to use wormholes.As the Dwellers saw it, to be Quick  to live life that precipitously  was to condemn oneself to an early end.Life had an inescapable trajectory, a natural curve.Evolution, development, progress: all conspired to push a sentient species along in a certain direction, and all you could do was choose to run that road or saunter along it.The Slow took their time, adapting to the given scale and natural limits of the galaxy and the universe as it existed.The Quick insisted on short cuts and seemed determined to bend the very fabric of space to their frantic, impatient will.When they were smart they succeeded in this wilfulness, but they only brought their own end all the quicker.They lived fast and died faster, describing sudden, glorious but quickly fading trails across the firmament.The Dwellers, like the other Slow, wanted to be around for the long term, and so were prepared to wait.So quite why the Dwellers would ever have bothered building a secret wormhole network was something of a mystery, as was how they had managed to keep it secret all these hundreds of millions of years, not to mention how this fitted in with the rather obvious nature of each different Dweller communitys isolation from each other.Nevertheless, the myth of the Dweller List continued to excite people in general and conspiracy theorists in particular, especially in times of threat and desperation, when it would be really, really great if a secret wormhole network did exist.Fassin agreed with the textbooks that it had been no coincidence the List had first turned up during the Burster War, when the whole galactic community had seemed to be falling apart, and people were looking for salvation, for hope, anywhere.Then, the arteria total had been falling from its earlier  and then all time  high of nearly 39,000 to under a thousand.At the nadir of the Third Chaos there had been less than a hundred holes in the whole galaxy, and the Dwellers hadnt stepped in then with an offer to let everybody else use this secret system.If not then, when the light of civilisation seemed to be fading from the great lens entirely, then when?When and why would they ever come galloping to the rescue?Part of the seductive attraction of the List was its sheer size.It contained over two million sets of alleged portal coordinates, implying more than one million arteria, presumably linked in a single enormous network.At the height of the Third Complex, eight thousand years earlier, there had been exactly 217,390 established wormholes threading the galaxy together, and that was as good, as far as was known, as it had ever got.If the Dweller List genuinely enumerated existing portals and arteria, it would represent the promise of instigating the single greatest change in the history of the galaxy; the sudden linking up of two million systems, many of which had never had any connection before, the bringing together of almost everybody everywhere  the very furthest, most utterly isolated star would likely be a mere decade or two away from the nearest portal  and the near instant revitalising, on a scale unheard of in nearly twelve billion years of tenacious, sporadically stuttering civilisation, of the entire galactic community.It was, Fassin and almost all his fellow Seers had long thought, a forlorn hope.The Dwellers didnt need or show any sign of using wormholes.Being Dwellers, they naturally claimed they were experts at arteria and portal technology, and certainly they were not afraid of using wormholes, it was just that they didnt see the need for them but if they ever had been seriously involved with wormhole production, those days were long gone.In any case, the List itself, which had been lying around in libraries and data reservoirs, multitudinously copied for hundreds of millions of years, accessible to anybody with a link, was not the end of the story; it just gave the rough coordinates of two million gas giants in two million systems.What was needed was a more precise location.The obvious places to look were the relevant Trojan or Lagrange points, the gravitationally stable locations dotted around and between the orbits of the various planets in the named systems.However, these had all long since been eliminated.After that it got much more tricky.In theory a worm hole mouth could be left in any stable orbit anywhere in a system and never be found unless you practically tripped over it.Working portals were anything up to a kilometre wide and had an effective mass of several hundred thousand tonnes, whereas a portal shrunk and stabilised and set up to keep itself that way with relatively simple automatics systems could lie in an orbit as far out as a systems Oort cloud with a gravitational footprint of less than a kilogramme more or less indefinitely.The problem was how to describe where it was.Allegedly there was some extra set of coordinates, or even a single mathematical operation, a transform, which, when applied to any given set of coordinates in the original list, somehow magically derived the exact position of that systems portal.The obvious objection to this was that after four hundred million years, minimum, there was no known coordinate system ever devised capable of reliably determining where something as small as a portal was.(Unless the holes had all somehow automatically kept themselves in the same relative position all that time.Given the haphazard and cavalier attitude that Dwellers tended to display towards anything especially high tech, this was regarded as highly unlikely. )So, the image hovering above the dark device in the centre of the audience chamber said, if I may assume we are all happy we know what were talking about It looked around them again.Nobody demurred.The Dweller List, the hologram said, supposedly giving the approximate location of two million ancient portals dating from the time of the Third Diasporian Age, has been dismissed as an irrelevance, a lie or a myth for over a quarter of a billion years.The so called Transform, supposed to complete the information required to access this secret network, has proved as elusive as it is unlikely to work if it does exist.Nevertheless.Some new information has come to light, thanks to Seer, now Major, Taak.Fassin was aware that he was being looked at again.He just kept staring at the hologram.A little under four hundred years ago, the hologram said, Seer Taak took part in an extended expedition  a delve as it is known  which took him amongst the Dwellers of Nasqueron, and specifically into the company of a group of Dweller youngsters called the Dimajrian Tribe.While with them, he encountered an antique Dweller who  in a fit of generosity unusual in his kind  granted Seer Taak access to a small library of information, part of a still larger hoard.(This was the wrong way round  the myth, not the fact.Fassin had been with Valseir for centuries and the Dimajrian Tribe for less than a year.He hoped that the rest of the Admirals information was more reliable.All the same, he had a sudden, vivid memory of choal Valseir, huge and ancient, accoutred with rags, draped in life charms, floating absently within his vast nest bowl of a study, deep in the lost section of abandoned CloudTunnel on the rim of a giant, dying storm which had long since broken up and dissipated.Clouds.You are like clouds, Valseir had told Fassin.At the time he hadnt understood what the ancient Dweller had meant. )The raw data containing this information was passed on to the Shrievalty for analysis, the image hovering above the black device said.Twenty years later, after the usual analysis and interpretation and, youd imagine, with plenty of time for second thoughts, re evaluations and sudden inspirations, it was shared with the Jeltick under the terms of an infotrade agreement.The Jeltick were an arachnoid species, eight limbed  8ar, in the conventional shorthand of the galactic community.Obsessive cataloguers, they were one of the galaxys two most convincing self appointed historian species.Timid, cautious, deliberate and very inquisitive (at a safe remove), they had been around for much longer than Quick species usually lasted.Somehow, the Jeltick contrived to notice something the Shrievalty had missed, the hologram continued.(Now, Fassin noticed, it was Colonel Somjomions turn to look awkward and aggrieved. )Heads have rolled due to this incompetence, the image told them.It smiled.Ido not speak figuratively  Colonel Somjomion compressed her lips and rechecked something on the machine she was in charge of.Within months, the hologram said, the Jeltick sent their best excuse for a battle fleet to the Zateki system  unexplored for millennia  which lies about eighteen years from the portal at Rijom; they got there in twenty years, so they were not exactly dawdling.It ought to be pointed out that the Jeltick would never normally try anything so dynamic, or risky.Something at Zateki seriously chewed up the Jeltick ships and what is assumed to have been the sole survivor was later found by a Voehn craft.The surviving ship was fleeing, all upon it were dead and its biomind was deranged, invoking the mercy of an unknown god and babbling for forgiveness for what had been its mission, which had been to search for the remains of something called the Second Ship and, therein, the Dweller List Transform.Ah, thought Fassin.The Second Ship Theory.That was a sub fallacy of the whole Dweller List delusion.The further you looked into the List myth, the more complicated it got and the more possibilities appeared to open up.All nonsense, of course, or so everybody had thought.Somehow, we assume through spies, the Beyonders and : possibly through the Beyonders  the E 5 Disconnect got to hear about this.The Beyonders attacked the Ulubis portal less than a month later and the E 5 Discons sudden interest in Ulubis also dates from this point.When the Jeltick realised the secret was no longer theirs alone, the image said, they broadcast leaked it, to avoid accusations of partiality and maintain their reputation for disinterestedness.The projection gave a sour look.This has not gone down too well with the Ascendancy, either  one imagines the Jeltick will be made to pay somewhere down the line.In any event, five full squadrons of the Summed Fleet  over three hundred capital ships : retraced the Jeltick fleets route to Rijom and Zateki, but found nothing.Under full disclosure it has turned out that the information concerned was in any case incomplete; the lead is, as it were, only half formed.The Jeltick move was a gamble, reckoned even by themselves at having a less than twelve per cent likelihood of success.For such a cautious species to make such a wild wager with their reputation and future alone indicates the value of the prize they sought.The hologram brought its gloved hands together, producing an audible clap.So, now almost everybody who wants to know about the new Transform lead  such as it may be  does know, and this would appear to include the Disconnect of the Starveling Cult, and  quiet though they may have seemed recently  the Beyonders, who may or may not be in league with the E 5 Discon.Hence the most recent attacks on Ulubis, and the coming invasion.But be aware, the image said, growling, eyes narrowing, that behind this terrible threat lies a fabulous prize.If we can discover where the hidden portals lie  assuming that they are indeed there to be discovered  we may well be able to intervene in the Ulubis system before the Starveling Cult invasion force arrives.It would be entirely worth the most supreme effort and sacrifice for that result alone.Even more importantly, however, this is a prize that could, that just might, that can unlock the galaxy and usher in a new golden age of prosperity and security for the Mercatoria, for all of us.The projection paused once more.Our strategists estimate that even with the best result from those actions we shall ask you to undertake, the chances of success remain below fifty per cent.The projection appeared to draw breath.But that is not the point.The smallest chance of the greatest reward, when so few may compete for it, makes the contention compulsory.All that matters is that we may have been presented with an extraordinary, utterly unprecedented opportunity.We would all be in serious, even ultimate dereliction of duty if we did not do everything in our power to seize that opportunity, not just on our own behalf but for the good of all our fellow creats, and for those generations yet unborn.The image smiled one of its cold smiles.The orders I have to pass on to you from the Complector Council are: to Seer : now Major  Taak.(The projection was already looking straight at Fassin.Now so did a lot of the people in the chamber. )Return to Nasqueron, seek out the ancient Dweller who gave you the original information and try to find out all you can about the Dweller List, the Second Ship, its location and the Transform.And, to everybody else here, (the image looked around all the others in the chamber) first, provide every aid you can to Major Taak in the furtherance of his mission, including doing nothing that will delay, obstruct or compromise it, and, second, return the Ulubis system to an invasion imminent, full scale, total war footing immediately and prepare to oppose the coming invasion.Your goal should be  and I do not exaggerate here  to resist to the very last creat, to the very last mortal, to the very last breath.The hologram seemed to stand back a little and take the measure of them all.I would say to all of you that, without doubt, your fate lies in your own hands.More importantly, so, potentially, does the fate of the Mercatoria and the civilised galaxy.The rewards for success will be unprecedented in their scale and splendour.The punishments for failure will begin with ignominy and disgrace and plumb new depths of ghastliness beyond.One last thing.You know that the Engineership Est taun Zhiffir and battle fleet escort which sent this signal are still seventeen years from reaching Ulubis system.I must tell you that significant elements of the Summed Fleet, above Squadron strength, were dispatched in your direction from Zenerre even before the Eship left and have been making well in excess of the Eship fleets velocity directly towards Ulubis ever since.The attack squadrons will arrive years before the Eship and its escort fleet, their war craft will be fully deployed for uninhibited battle against all who oppose the Mercatoria, and  depend upon it : they will prevail.The image smiled again.How I wish I could tell you exactly how soon from this point they will appear.However, even I do not know; this signal was sent from the fleet accompanying the Eship and we do not yet know quite how close to light speed they have pushed themselves, or how close they will have by the time this signal arrives.We can only hazard.If the Disconnecters leave off for as long as another couple of years, the attack squadrons may well arrive before them.Otherwise, they will descend upon a system already fallen to the enemy, or, one would hope, still somehow resisting.Their reaction when they arrive largely depends on your determination, fortitude and ability to absorb punishment.The projection smiled.Now: any further questions?* * *  The Beyonders must have anticipated them.Their ships were already making ninety per cent of their own furious, headlong speed when they appeared on the point ships long distance scanners.Taince Yarabokin floated foetal, swaddled in shock gel, lungs full of fluid, umbilicalled to the ship, nurtured by it, talking to it, listening to it, feeling it all around her.A gee suit half completed the image of warrior as unborn, leaving the wearer clothed in a close second skin.Her connection with the ship was via implants and an induction collar rather than a cord into her navel, and her chest moved only faintly as the gillfluid tided oxygen into her blood and scrubbed waste gases out again.Behind her closed lids in that darkness, her eyes flickered to and fro, twitching involuntarily.She shared her close confinement with another forty or so of her comrades, all lying curled and protected and wired up in their own life pods, all carried deep in the belly of the fleets flagship, the Mannlicher  Carcano.Way ahead at point, the destroyer Petronel veered, maxing its engines, then blinked out in a wash of light that became darkness as the sensors compensated.The buffering faded and revealed the half of the lead ship that was left, tumbling wildly, tearing itself apart in dark curved fountains of debris, spraying fragments against the tunnel scape of hard blue white stars collected ahead.Point registers multiple contacts at ninety fleet vee, said one voice, flagged as LR sensors.Point is hit, came another; Fleet Status.Point contact lost, came a third, followed immediately by:   Point gone; Fleet Comms and Status almost colliding.Instantly aware, Taince had just sufficient time for one small,  frightened part of herself to think, No!Not on my watch!And right in the Fleet Admirals nap time, when she was in sole charge.But even as that reaction seemed to echo and die inside her head, she was sensing, judging, thinking, getting ready to issue orders.She flitted between the real as it could be view shown by the deep space scan sensors, where the stars were bunched hard blue white in a circle ahead and collected into a fuzzy red pool behind with pure blackness in every other direction, and the dark abstraction that was Tacspace, a multi lined and radiused sphere where the ships of the fleet sat, little stylised arrowhead shapes of varying sizes and colours, a line of fading dots behind each indicating their courses, green glowing identities and status codes riding alongside them.The pre prepared split pattern wouldnt work; the ship which had just traded point with the Petronel was still sliding back into position in the main body of the fleet and a pattern one split would at worst cause multiple collisions and at best be just too slow.Oh well, time to start earning her pay and communicate.Taince sent,  Pattern five split, all ships.BC three, that plus a two point inward, left skew delta, for five, then resume.Copy signals flicked back, the first from her own helm officer, the last from the battlecruiser Jingal, registering its adherence to the slight kink shed put in its course the better to accommodate their D seven: Destroyer seven, the Culverin, the ship which had been falling back after swapping point with the Petronel.She was distantly aware of her body registering a pulse of movement, a sudden change in direction so extreme that even the shock gel couldnt completely mask it.Around them, the ships would be flaring off like their own silent shrapnel burst.Hull stress eighty five, Ship Integrity Damage Control told her.All units responding.Full pattern five flare, said Fleet Status.D seven: thanks for that, joining pattern.C one: single contact, five nor down west.D three: double contact, neg four nor up east.The cruiser Mitrailleuse and the destroyer Cartouche registering hostiles.Taince didnt even need to glance into Tacspace to know that meant harmfuls on both sides.So, bracketing.A straddle.Got us good.The last two voices had been the two most senior fellow tactical officers.We sound as though we play Battleships.(That was Fleet Admiral Kisipt.Awake now, watching.Apparently content to let Taince run the show for the moment. )C one: hostile contact confirmed.PTF.D three: hostile contact confirmed.PTF.Mitrailleuse and Cartouche requesting permission to fire.Suggest fire\Suggest fire, the other tacticians chorused.Agree fire, Fleet Admiral Kisipt said.Vice?Vice Admiral Taince Yarabokin thought so too.C one, D three; grant free fire.C one: Firing.D three: Firing.Tacspace showed bright crimson beams flick from the two ships.Tiny, lime green dots with their own status bars were missiles, darting towards the enemy ships.Multiple hits on the D one debris field, LR Sensors reported.Still flare?Still flare, Taince confirmed.She was watching the scintil lations ahead, where the wildly spinning, whirling, somer saulting wreckage of the Petronel was being hit by further enemy munitions.The remains were dropping back rapidly towards the main fleet as it spread quickly outwards.She clicked up a countdown to their impact with the debris field: seventy six seconds.She shifted the read out to a skin sensation to avoid cluttering her visual feed.No positive results from the laser fire being laid down by the Mitrailleuse and Cartouche.Their missiles were still heading towards the hostile craft.No sign of reply so far.What if were wrong?Taince thought.What if theyve out thought us and our so neat manoeuvre?Deep in her life pod cocoon, she gave a semblance of a shrug without realising it herself.Oh well, then we may all be dead.At least it should be quick.Still flare?Still flare, she confirmed again.Waiting, judging, wondering if this would work.Tacspace showed the second hand, now increasingly out of date contacts the Petronel had spotted as a glowing, slowly dispersing cloud of pulsing yellow echoes.The two hard contacts still registering on the sensors of the Mitrailleuse and the Cartouche and now confirmed by other nearby ships were strobing red dots, slowly closing.The wreckage from the Petronel was a stippled mess of purple, dead ahead and drifting closer, slowly spreading.Its okay, Taince told herself.We can do this.They had rehearsed all this, trained and exercised in VR time after time, specifically for this eventuality, this ambush and manoeuvre and response suite.They knew that the Beyonders would anticipate a fleet being sent from Zenerre to Ulubis.There was, of course, only one quickest possible route; the straight line direct one, its laser clean rule turned into the shallowest of curves solely by allowing for the minimal drift of the respective systems as they circled with the rest of the galactic outskirts round the great wheels core, fifty thousand light years away.So, did the fleet take exactly that route, laying itself open to ambush by other ships, and  more threateningly  to mines?(Mines, indeed; all you needed was a few tonnes of crushed rock.Smash a tiny asteroid into gravel the size of rice grains, spread it across the course the fleet would  take and  if they were travelling quickly enough  you could waste the lot; so close to light speed that you didnt need to have anything home in and explode, just getting in the way was devastating enough. )Or did you loop further out, avoiding likely interception but arriving later?And did you stick together (obvious but sensible) or split up, all the individual craft taking their own route to Ulubis, only regrouping near their destination (very risky, but potentially a tactic that the enemy wouldnt have anticipated)?In the end the Fleet Admiral had chosen one out of a bunch of faintly bowed courses recommended by the strategists and their sub AI machines, and they followed that route en masse.It was a gamble.The chances were that they would be inter cepted, especially if the Beyonders possessed the kind of materiel they were thought to have between Zenerre and Ulubis.The obvious intercept strategy was to station minor ships and other sensor platforms about halfway, then position the intercept units well behind that  already making high speed  to give them time to gather for the attack.In a direct pitched battle, there was no possibility that the vastly outnumbered and out armed Beyonder ships would prevail.But then, they didnt need or want a pitched battle, they just had to slow the Mercatoria fleet down as much as possible.They wanted skirmishes, ambushes, and to use the fleets own colossal velocity against it.The Mercatoria fleet could, in theory, have gone slow and safe, assured just by its sheer weight of arms of being able to blast anything ahead of it out of the skies.Its orders, though, were to get to Ulubis as quickly as possible, regardless, and so it had to travel almost ultimately quickly and risk being torn to bits by a few small ships and nothing more high tech than a few tonnes of pulverised rock.Theyd come up with a surprise plan of their own.Needle ships were designed to fit through narrow worm holes, it was that simple.The biggest arteria and the widest portals were a kilometre across, but the average hole diameter was under fifty metres and a few very old arteria were barely ten metres wide.It took a vast amount of energy and\or matter to make an arteria and its two portals, and it was difficult, expensive and dangerous to expand them once they were emplaced.There was, for the Mercatoria, little point in having a network of super fast travel connections scattered throughout the galaxy if your ships were too fat to fit, and so the proportions of war craft  the ultimate levers of power for the Mercatoria, just as they had been for all earlier imperia, semimperia and others who had thought to enforce their peace or impose their will on the galactic community over the aeons  were derived from the width of the channels they would have to negotiate.In the past, some great capital ships could auto deconstruct to become a shower of smaller, slimmer components which could fit through a wormhole, and were then capable of reassembling themselves at the far end, but this had proved a wasteful way of designing war craft.Needle ships were simpler and cheaper, for all their astounding complexity and cost.The biggest craft in the battle fleet heading from Zenerre to Ulubis were a kilometre long but less than forty metres across the beam.Almost right at the enemy ship, the missile fired by the Mitrailleuse winked out, replaced by a tiny debris field.Signals from the cruiser, Sensors and Status confirmed this.That missile snapped a hostile profile before it was picked off, Weapons reported, side screening the data the missile had plipped back.Sceuri ship, Sulcus or Fosse class, one Tactics officer sent.So they were dealing  at least in that ship  with the Deathspiral, Taince thought.That particular Beyonder group was exclusively Sceuri; waterworlders with a hatred for the Mercatoria in general and those of their own kind who were a part of it in particular (which meant most of them).Renowned for their viciousness and without even the excuse that they were protecting their precious civilian habitats.They didnt have any, they were almost entirely ship based.A bunch of piratical terrorists, in other words, just fanatics.And yet as far as anyone knew the Deathspiral hadnt taken part in the attack on the Ulubis portal.So that makes four, not three varieties of Beyonder oper ating in this volume, the Admiral sent, saying what Taince was thinking.Two more and well have the set, she replied.Back in Tacspace, she watched the Cartouches missile curving to meet the twisting trace that was the other nearest hostile.It joined it, overlaying it.A white blink, then an infinitesimal spray of debris, red speckled with green.D three: Hit!Hostile hit!Tainces two fellow tacticians aboard the flagship made whooping noises.Well done, D three, said Kisipt.Still flare?Still flare.Taince ignored the celebratory noises and her own feeling of excitement.She watched Tacspace, listened to the ship chatter, felt the seconds count down.The fleet was still spreading, the vessels courses fanning out like thin stems from a short vase.Taince held off and held off and held off, until she could almost feel Fleet Admiral Kisipt and everybody else getting ready to shout at her.Forty seconds.She sent,  De flare.Pattern five reverse.Copy, said her own helm officer, then the other acknowledgements followed.In Tacspace, the flowering, widening ship tracks immediately started to bunch up again, the distances between them closing.C one: Going to be tight.But it was doable.They could get back to their earlier formation before they encountered the remains of the Petronel; that was all that mattered for now.Tacspace showed the fleet regrouping smoothly.The view ahead showed the fiercely glowing nebula of wreckage from the Petronel, seeming to spread across the sky as they approached it, encroaching onto the dark, starless tube on either side.She zoomed in, picking out a clear spot near the centre of the debris field, checking it in Tacspace.There.The two hard contacts winked out, became orange and started to spread.Tacspace was throwing out probability cones, estimating where the ships might be.Ahead, the sky briefly glowed a pale uniform yellow, indicating that the rest of the Beyonder fleet could be anywhere within that volume.Then a scattering of bright red hard contacts firmed up out of the yellow wash, dispersing it.The fleet re formed.They were back where they had started.If nothing else, Taince thought, they ought to have confused the Beyonders.Pattern Zero, all ships.Even in the life pod, she felt the flagship lurch as it braked, manoeuvred and then accelerated again.She watched it all on Tacspace.The fleet was collapsing, thinning, extending itself forwards and back, ship after ship slipping into a single long line, nose to tail.BC four, back down about ten.D eleven, forward five.B three and B two, centre on D eight.BC four, maintain there.Taince watched them all in Tacspace, shuffling, jostling, ordering them into position until they were all lined up.Ships of the line, yes, Vice?the Fleet Admiral sent, also watching.Sir.There were no collisions, no botched moves, no drives left running too long, incinerating the craft behind.The line formation came together as smoothly as it ever had in VR sims.The battleship Gisarme led the way, blasting away a few tiny parti cles left over from the wreck of the Petronel and laying down a stuttered laser barrage to try to intercept any mines, kinetic or otherwise, left in the way.This was a gamble, too.If it worked theyd be through and away, one after another, charging mob handed right behind the Gisarme like a long sequence of battering rams.If it didnt work, there was a chance that first the Gisarme would hit something and then theyd all hit whatever was left of it.Potentially the whole fleet could be wiped out in one long pile up of cascading collisions.The chances were small  smaller, the simulations indicated, than the risks associated with any of the other manoeuvres  but only because this one included a safety premium due to its assumed unexpectedness, its sheer novelty value.If theyd got that wrong, it was much riskier than all the rest.The manoeuvre caught the Beyonders unawares.It was profoundly not standard Summed Fleet behaviour.The needle ships were one giant needle now, plunging through the debris field of the wrecked destroyer, firing all around them, scoring a couple of hits on distant hostiles desperately closing.Tacspace showed the lines of fire blazing out from the fleet like spokes from a filament thin shaft and missiles spinning away like tiny glowing emeralds.
