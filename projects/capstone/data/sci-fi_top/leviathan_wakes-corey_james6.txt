Lets get this asshole to a medic.Hold on!the first guard said, and Miller sighed.Four of them.If he dropped Ko and jumped for cover but there wasnt much cover.And who the hell knew what Holden would do?Where are the shooters?the guard asked.Miller kept himself from smiling.Theres a hole about a quarter klick anti spinward, Miller said.The other ones bodys still there.You cant miss it.Miller turned down the ramp.Behind him, the guards were talking among themselves, debating what to do, who to call, who to send.Youre completely insane, Holden said over Kos semiconscious weeping.Maybe he was right.* * *   When, Miller wondered, does someone stop being human?There had to be a moment, some decision that you made, and before it, you were one person, and after it, someone else.Walking down through the levels of Eros, Kos bleeding body slung between him and Holden, Miller reflected.He was probably dying of radiation damage.He was lying his way past half a dozen men who were only letting him by because they were used to people being scared of them and he wasnt.He had killed three people in the last two hours.Four if he counted Ko.Probably safer to say four, then.The analytical part of his mind, the small, still voice he had cultivated for years, watched him move and replayed all his decisions.Everything hed done had made perfect sense at the time.Shooting Ko.Shooting the other three.Leaving the safety of the crews hideout to investigate the evacuation.Emotionally, it had all been obvious at the time.It was only when he considered it from outside that it seemed dangerous.If hed seen it in someone else Muss, Havelock, Sematimba he wouldnt have taken more than a minute to realize theyd gone off the rails.Since it was him, he had taken longer to notice.But Holden was right.Somewhere along the line, hed lost himself.He wanted to think it had been finding Julie, seeing what had happened to her body, knowing he hadnt been able to save her, but that was only because it seemed like the sentimental moment.The truth was his decisions before then leaving Ceres to go on a wild hunt for Julie, drinking himself out of a career, remaining a cop for even a day after that first kill all those years earlier none of them seemed to make sense, viewed objectively.Hed lost a marriage to a woman hed loved once.Hed lived hip deep in the worst humanity had to offer.Hed learned firsthand that he was capable of killing another human being.And nowhere along the line could he say that there, at that moment, he had been a sane, whole man, and that afterward, he hadnt.Maybe it was a cumulative process, like smoking cigarettes.One didnt do much.Five didnt do much more.Every emotion hed shut down, every human contact hed spurned, every love and friendship and moment of compassion from which hed turned had taken him a degree away from himself.Until now, hed been able to kill men with impunity.To face his impending death with a denial that let him make plans and take action.In his mind, Julie Mao tilted her head, listening to his thoughts.In his mind, she held him, her body against his in a way that was more comforting than erotic.Consoling.Forgiving.This was why he had searched for her.Julie had become the part of him that was capable of human feeling.The symbol of what he could have been if he hadnt been this.There was no reason to think his imagined Julie had anything in common with the real woman.Meeting her would have been a disappointment for them both.He had to believe that, the same way hed had to believe everything that had cut him off from love before.Holden stopped, the body corpse now of Ko tugging Miller back to himself.What?Miller said.Holden nodded at the access panel in front of them.Miller looked at it, uncomprehending, and then recognized it.Theyd made it.They were back at the hideout.Are you all right?Holden said.Yeah, Miller said.Just woolgathering.Sorry.He dropped Ko, and the thug slid to the floor with a sad thud.Millers arm had fallen asleep.He shook it, but the tingling didnt go away.A wave of vertigo and nausea passed through him.Symptoms, he thought.Howd we do for time?Miller asked.Were a little past deadline.Five minutes.Itll be fine, Holden said, and slid the door open.The space beyond, where Naomi and Alex and Amos had been, was empty.Fuck me, Holden said.Fuck me, Holden said.And a moment later: They left us.No.She had left him.Naomi had said she would, but confronted with the reality of it, Holden realized that he hadnt really believed her.But here it was the proof.The empty space where she used to be.His heart hammered and his throat tightened, breath coming in gasps.The sick feeling in his gut was either despair or his colon sloughing off its lining.He was going to die sitting outside a cheap hotel on Eros because Naomi had done exactly what shed said she would.What he himself had ordered her to do.His resentment refused to listen to reason.Were dead, he said, and sat down on the edge of a fern filled planter.How long do we have?Miller asked, looking up and down the corridor while he fidgeted with his gun.No idea, Holden replied, gesturing vaguely at his terminals flashing red radiation symbol.Hours before we really start to feel it, I think, but I dont know.God, I wish Shed was still here.Shed?Friend of mine, Holden said, not feeling up to elaborating.Good med tech.Call her, Miller said.Holden looked at his terminal and tapped the screen a few times.Networks still down, he said.All right, Miller said.Lets go to your ship.See if its still in dock.Theyll be gone.Naomis keeping the crew alive.She warned me, but I   So lets go anyway, Miller said.He was shifting from one foot to the other and looking down the corridor as he spoke.Miller, Holden said, then stopped.Miller was clearly on edge, and hed shot four people.Holden was increasingly frightened of the former cop.As if reading his mind, Miller stepped close, the two meter man towering over him where he sat.Miller smiled ruefully, his eyes unnervingly gentle.Holden would almost have preferred they be threatening.Way I see it, theres three ways this can go, Miller said.One, we find your ship still in dock, get the meds we need, and maybe we live.Two, we try to get to the ship, and along the way we run into a bunch of mafia thugs.Die gloriously in a hail of bullets.Three, we sit here and leak out of our eyes and assholes.Holden said nothing; he just stared up at the cop and frowned.Im liking the first two better than the last one, Miller said.His voice made it sound like an apology.How about you come with?Holden laughed before he could catch himself, but Miller didnt look like he was taking offense.Sure, Holden said.I just needed to feel sorry for myself for a minute.Lets go get killed by the mafia.He said it with much more bravado than he felt.The truth was he didnt want to die.Even during his time in the navy, the idea of dying in the line of duty had always seemed distant and unreal.His ship would never be destroyed, and if it was, he would make it to the escape shuttle.The universe without him in it didnt make any sense at all.Hed taken risks; hed seen other people die.Even people he loved.Now, for the first time, his own death was a real thing.He looked at the cop.Hed known the man less than a day, didnt trust him, and wasnt sure he much liked him.And this was who hed die with.Holden shuddered and stood up, pulling his gun out of his waistband.Under the panic and fear, there was a deep feeling of calm.He hoped it would last.After you, Holden said.If we make it, remind me to call my mothers.* * *   The casinos were a powder keg waiting for a match.If the evacuation sweeps had been even moderately successful, there were probably a million or more people crammed into three levels of the station.Hard looking men in riot gear moved through the crowds, telling everyone to stay put until they were taken to the radiation shelters, keeping the crowd frightened.Every now and then, a small group of citizens would be led away.Knowing where they were going made Holdens stomach burn.He wanted to yell out that cops were fake, that they were killing people.But a riot with this many people in such a confined space would be a meat grinder.Maybe that was inevitable but he wasnt going to be the one to start it.Someone else did.Holden could hear raised voices, the angry rumble of the mob, followed by the electronically amplified voice of someone in a riot helmet yelling for people to get back.And then a gunshot, a brief pause, then a fusillade.People screamed.The entire crowd around Holden and Miller surged in two opposing directions, some of the people rushing toward the sound of the conflict, but many more of them running away from it.Holden spun in the current of bodies; Miller reached out and grabbed the back of his shirt, gripping it in his fist and yelling for Holden to stay close.About a dozen meters down the corridor, in a coffee shop seating area separated by a waist high black iron fence, one of the mafia thugs had been cut off from his group by a dozen citizens.Gun drawn, he was backing up and yelling at them to move aside.They kept advancing, their faces wild with the drunken frenzy of mob violence.The mafia thug fired once, and one small body staggered forward, then fell to the ground at the thugs feet.Holden couldnt tell if it was a boy or a girl, but they couldnt be more than thirteen or fourteen years old.The thug moved forward, looking down at the small thin figure at his feet, and pointed his gun at them again.It was too much.Holden found himself running down the corridor toward the thug, gun drawn and screaming for people to get out of the way.When he was about seven meters away, the crowd split apart enough for him to begin firing.Half his shots went wild, hitting the coffee shop counter and walls, one round blowing a stack of ceramic plates into the air.But a few of them hit the thug, staggering him back.Holden vaulted the waist high metal fence and came to a sliding halt about three meters from the fake cop and his victim.Holdens gun fired one last time and then the slide locked in the open position to let him know it was empty.The thug didnt fall down.He straightened up, looked down at his torso, and then looked up and pointed his gun at Holdens face.Holden had time to count the three bullets that were smashed against the heavy chest armor of the thugs riot gear.Die gloriously in a hail of bullets, he thought.The thug said, Stupid mother fu  and his head snapped back in a spray of red.He slumped to the floor.Gap at the neck, remember?Miller said from behind him.Chest armors too thick for a pistol.Suddenly dizzy, Holden bent over at the waist, gasping for air.He tasted lemon at the back of his throat and swallowed twice to stop himself from throwing up.He was afraid it would be full of blood and stomach lining.He didnt need to see that.Thanks, he gasped out, turning his head toward Miller.Miller just nodded vaguely in his direction, then walked over to the guard and nudged him with one foot.Holden stood up and looked around the corridor, waiting for the inevitable wave of vengeful mafia enforcers to come crashing down on them.He didnt see any.He and Miller were standing in a quiet island of calm in the midst of Armageddon.All around them, tendrils of violence were whipping into high gear.People were running in every direction; the mafia goons were yelling in booming amplified voices and punctuating the threats with periodic gunfire.But there were only hundreds of them, and there were many thousands of angry and panicked civilians.Miller gestured at the chaos.This is what happens, he said.Give a bunch of yahoos the equipment, and they think they know what theyre doing.Holden crouched beside the fallen child.It was a boy, maybe thirteen, with Asian features and dark hair.His chest had a gaping wound in it, blood trickling out instead of gushing.He didnt have a pulse that Holden could find.Holden picked him up anyway, looking around for someplace to take him.Hes dead, Miller said as he replaced the cartridge hed fired.Go to hell.We dont know.If we can get him to the ship, maybe   Miller shook his head, a sad but distant expression on his face as he looked at the child in Holdens arms.He took high caliber round to the center of mass, Miller said.Hes gone.* * *   Fuck me, Holden said.You keep saying that.A bright neon sign flashed above the corridor that led out of the casino levels and onto the ramps down to the docks.THANK YOU FOR PLAYING, it read.And YOURE ALWAYS A WINNER ON EROS.Below it, two ranks of men in heavy combat armor blocked the way.They might have given up on crowd control in the casinos, but they werent letting anyone go.Holden and Miller crouched behind an overturned coffee cart a hundred meters from the soldiers.As they watched, a dozen or so people made a dash toward the guards and were summarily mowed down by machine gun fire, then fell to the deck beside those who had tried before.I count thirty four of them, Miller said.How many can you handle?Holden spun to look at him in surprise, but Millers face told him the former cop was joking.Kidding aside, how do we get past that?Holden said.Thirty men with machine guns and a clear line of sight.No cover to speak of for the last twenty meters or so, Miller said.We dont get past that.They sat on the floor with their backs to a bank of pachinko machines no one was playing, watching the ebb and flow of the violence around them like it was a soccer game.Millers hat was perched on his bent knee.He felt the vibration against his back when one of the displays cycled through its dupe call.The lights glittered and glowed.Holden, beside him, was breathing hard, like hed run a race.Out beyond them, like something from Hieronymous Bosch, the casino levels of Eros prepared for death.The riots momentum had spent itself for now.Men and women gathered together in small groups.Guards strode through, threatening and scattering any bunch that got too large or unruly.Something was burning fast enough that the air scrubbers couldnt get out the smell of melting plastic.The bhangra Muzak mixed with weeping and screaming and wails of despair.Some idiot was shouting at one of the so called cops: he was a lawyer; he was getting all of this on video; whoever was responsible was going to be in big trouble.Miller watched a bunch of people start to gather around the confrontation.The guy in the riot gear listened, nodded, and shot the lawyer once in the kneecap.The crowd dispersed except for one woman, the lawyers wife or girlfriend, bent down over him screaming.And in the privacy of Millers skull, everything slowly fell apart.He was aware of having two different minds.One was the Miller he was used to, familiar with.The one who was thinking about what was going to happen when he got out, what the next step would be in connecting the dots between Phoebe Station, Ceres, Eros, and Juliette Mao, how to work the case.That version of him was scanning the crowd the way he might have watched the line at a crime scene, waiting for some detail, some change to catch his attention.Send him in the right direction to solve the mystery.It was the shortsighted, idiotic part of him that couldnt conceive of his own personal extinction, and it thought surely, surely there was going to be an after.The other Miller was different.Quieter.Sad, maybe, but at peace.Hed read a poem many years before called The Death Self, and he hadnt understood the term until now.A knot at the middle of his psyche was untying.All the energy hed put into holding things together Ceres, his marriage, his career, himself was coming free.Hed shot and killed more men in the past day than in his whole career as a cop.Hed started only started to realize that hed actually fallen in love with the object of his search after he knew for certain that hed lost her.Hed seen unequivocally that the chaos hed dedicated his life to holding at bay was stronger and wider and more powerful than he would ever be.No compromise he could make would be enough.His death self was unfolding in him, and the dark blooming took no effort.It was a relief, a relaxation, a long, slow exhale after decades of holding it in.He was in ruins, but it was okay, because he was dying.Hey, Holden said.His voice was stronger than Miller had expected it might be.Yeah?Did you ever watch Misko and Marisko when you were a kid?Miller frowned.The kids show?he asked.The one with the five dinosaurs and the evil guy in the big pink hat, Holden said, then starting humming a bright, boppy tune.Miller closed his eyes and then started singing along.The music had had words once.Now it was only a series of rises and falls, runs up and down a major scale, with every dissonance resolved in the note that followed.Guess I must have, Miller said when they reached the end.I loved that show.I must have been eight or nine last time I saw it, Holden said.Funny how that stuff stays with you.Yeah, Miller said.He coughed, turned his head, and spat out something red.How are you holding together?I think Im okay, Holden said.Then, a moment later, he added, As long as I dont stand up.Nauseated?Yeah, some.Me too.What is this?Holden asked.I mean, what the hell is this all about?Why are they doing this?It was a fair question.Slaughtering Eros slaughtering any station in the Belt was a pretty easy job.Anyone with first year orbital mechanics skills could find a way to sling a rock big enough and fast enough to crack the station open.With the effort Protogen had put in, they could have killed the air supply or drugged it or whatever the hell they wanted to do.This wasnt a murder.This wasnt even a genocide.And then there was all the observation equipment.Cameras, communications arrays, air and water sensors.There were only two reasons for that kind of shit.Either the mad bastards at Protogen got off on watching people die, or  They dont know, Miller said.What?He turned to look at Holden.The first Miller, the detective, the optimist, the one who needed to know, was driving now.His death self didnt fight, because of course it didnt.It didnt fight anything.Miller raised his hand, like he was giving a lecture to a rookie.They dont know what its about, or you know, at least they dont know whats going to happen.This isnt even built like a torture chamber.Its all being watched, right?Water and air sensors.Its a petri dish.They dont know what that shit that killed Julie does, and this is how theyre finding out.Holden frowned.Dont they have laboratories?Places where you could maybe put that crap on some animals or something?Because as experimental design goes, this seems a little messed up.Maybe they need a really big sample size, Miller said.Or maybe its not about the people.Maybe its about what happens to the station.Theres a cheery thought, Holden said.The Julie Mao in Millers mind brushed a lock of hair out of her eyes.She was frowning, looking thoughtful, interested, concerned.It all had to make sense.It was like one of those basic orbital mechanics problems where every hitch and veer seemed random until all the variables slipped into place.What had been inexplicable became inevitable.Julie smiled at him.Julie as she had been.As he imagined she had been.The Miller who hadnt resigned himself to death smiled back.And then she was gone, his mind shifting to the noise from the pachinko machines and the low, demonic wailing of the crowds.Another group twenty men hunkered low, like linebackers made a rush toward the mercenaries guarding the opening to the port.The gunmen mowed them down.If we had enough people, Holden said after the sound of machine guns fell away, we could make it.They couldnt kill all of us.Thats what the patrol goons are for, Miller said.Make sure no one can organize a big enough push.Keep stirring the pot.But if it was a mob, I mean a really big mob, it could   Maybe, Miller agreed.Something in his chest clicked in a way it hadnt a minute before.He took a slow, deep breath, and the click happened again.He could feel it deep in his left lung.At least Naomi got away, Holden said.That is good.Shes amazing.Shed never put Amos and Alex in danger if she could help it.I mean, shes serious.Professional.Strong, you know?I mean, shes really, really   Pretty, too, Miller said.Great hair.Love the eyes.No, that wasnt what I meant, Holden said.You dont think shes a good looking woman?Shes my XO, Holden said.Shes you know   Off limits.Holden sighed.She got away, didnt she?Holden asked.Almost for sure.They were silent.One of the linebackers coughed, stood up, and limped back into the casino, trailing blood from a hole in his ribs.The bhangra gave way to an afropop medley with a low, sultry voice singing in languages Miller didnt know.Shed wait for us, Holden said.Dont you think shed wait for us?Almost for sure, Millers death self said, not particularly caring if it was a lie.He thought about it for a long moment, then turned to face Holden again.Hey.Just so you know it?Im not exactly at my best right now.Okay.All right.The glowing orange lockdown lights on the tube station across the level clicked to green.Miller sat forward, interested.His back felt sticky, but it was probably just sweat.Other people had noticed the change too.Like a current in a water tank, the attention of the nearby crowds shifted from the mercenaries blocking the way to the port to the brushed steel doors of the tube station.The doors opened, and the first zombies appeared.Men and women, their eyes glassy and their muscles slack, stumbled out through the open doors.Miller had seen a documentary feed about hemorrhagic fevers as part of his training on Ceres Station.Their movements were the same: listless, driven, autonomic.Like rabid dogs whose minds had already been given over to their disease.Hey, Miller said, his hand on Holdens shoulder.Hey, its happening.An older man in a pair of emergency services scrubs approached the shambling newcomers.His hands were out before him, as if he could corral them by simple force of will.The first zombie in the pack turned empty eyes toward him and vomited up a spray of very familiar brown goo.Look, Holden said.I saw.No, look!All down the casino level, tube station lights were going off lockdown.Doors were opening.The people were pulsing toward the open tubes and the implicit, empty promise of escape, and away from the dead men and women walking out from them.Vomit zombies, Miller said.From the rad shelters, Holden said.The thing, the organism.It goes faster in radiation, right?Thats why whats her name was so freaky about the lights and the vac suit.Her names Julie.And yeah.Those incubators were for this.Right here, Miller said, and sighed.He thought about standing up.Well.We may not die of radiation poisoning after all.Why not just pump that shit into the air?Holden asked.Anaerobic, remember?Miller said.Too much oxygen kills em.The vomit covered emergency medicine guy was still trying to treat the shambling zombies like they were patients.Like they were still humans.There were smears of the brown goo on peoples clothes, on the walls.The tube doors opened again, and Miller saw half a dozen people dodge into a tube car coated in brown.The mob churned, unsure what to do, the group mind stretched past its breaking point.A riot cop jumped forward and started spraying down the zombies with gunfire.The entrance and exit wounds spilled out fine loops of black filament, and the zombies went down.Miller chuckled even before he knew what was funny.Holden looked at him.They didnt know, Miller said.The bully boys in riot gear?They arent gonna get pulled out.Meat for the machine, just like the rest of us.Holden made a small approving sound.Miller nodded, but something was niggling at the back of his mind.The thugs from Ceres in their stolen armor were being sacrificed.That didnt mean everyone was.He leaned forward.The archway leading to the port was still manned.Mercenary fighters in formation, guns at the ready.If anything, they looked more disciplined now than they had before.Miller watched as the guy in the back with extra insignia on his armor barked into a mic.Miller had thought hope was dead.Hed thought all his chances had been played, and then, like a bitch, it all hauled itself up out of the grave.Get up, Miller said.What?Get up.Theyre going to pull back.Who?Miller nodded at the mercenaries.They knew, he said.Look at them.They arent freaking out.They arent confused.They were waiting for this.And you think that means theyll fall back?They arent going to be hanging out.Stand up.Almost as if hed been giving the order to himself, Miller groaned and creaked to his feet.His knees and spine ached badly.The click in his lung was getting worse.His belly made a soft, complicated noise that would have been concerning under different circumstances.As soon as he started moving, he could feel how far the damage had gone, his skin not yet in pain but in the soft presentiment of it, like the gap between a serious burn and the blisters that followed.If he lived, it was going to hurt.If he lived, everything was going to hurt.His death self tugged at him.The sense of release, of relief, of rest felt like something precious being lost.Even while the chattering, busy, machinelike mind kept grinding, grinding, grinding forward, the soft, bruised center of Millers soul urged him to pause, sit back down, let the problems go away.What are we looking for?Holden said.Hed stood up.A blood vessel in the mans left eye had given way, the white of the sclera turning a bright, meaty red.What are we looking for?the death self echoed.Theyre going to fall back, Miller said, answering the first question.We follow.Just outside the range so whoevers going last doesnt feel like he has to shoot us.Isnt everyone going to do the same thing?I mean, once theyre gone, isnt everyone in this place going to head in for the port?I expect so, Miller said.So lets try to slip in ahead of the rush.Look.There.It wasnt much.Just a change in the mercenaries stance, a shift in their collective center of gravity.Miller coughed.It hurt more than it should have.What are we looking for?his death self asked again, its voice more insistent.An answer?Justice?Another chance for the universe to kick us in the balls?What is through that archway that there isnt a faster, cleaner, less painful version of in the barrel of our gun?The mercenary captain took a casual step back and strode down the exterior corridor and out of sight.Where he had been, Julie Mao sat, watching him go.She looked at Miller.She waved him on.Not yet, he said.When?Holden said, his voice surprising Miller.Julie in his head flickered out, and he was back in the real world.Its coming, Miller said.He should warn the guy.It was only fair.You got into a bad place, and at the very least, you owed your partner the courtesy of letting him know.Miller cleared his throat.That hurt too.Its possible I may start hallucinating or become suicidal.You might have to shoot me.Holden glanced over at him.The pachinko machines lit them blue and green and shrieked in artificial delight.What?Holden said.Nothing.Getting my balance, Miller said.Behind them, a woman shouted.Miller glanced back to see her pushing a vomit zombie away, a slick of brown goo already covering the live woman.At the archway, the mercenaries quietly stepped back and started down the corridor.Come on, Miller said.He and Holden walked toward the archway, Miller pulling his hat on.Loud voices, screams, the low, liquid sound of people being violently ill.The air scrubbers were failing, the air taking on a deep, pungent odor like beef broth and acid.Miller felt like there was a stone in his shoe, but he was almost certain if he looked, there would be only a point of redness where his skin was starting break down.No one shot at them.No one told them to stop.At the archway, Miller led Holden against the wall, then ducked his head around the corner.A quarter second was all it took to know the long, wide corridor was empty.The mercs were done here and leaving Eros to its fate.The window was open.The way was clear.Last chance, he thought, and he meant both the last chance to live and the last one to die.Miller?Yeah, he said.It looks good.Come on.Before everyone gets the idea.Something was moving in Holdens gut.He ignored it and kept his eyes on Millers back.The lanky detective barreled down the corridor toward the port, stopping occasionally at junctions to peek around the corner and look for trouble.Miller had become a machine.All Holden could do was try to keep up.Always the same distance ahead were the mercenaries whod been guarding the exit from the casino.When they moved, Miller moved.When they slowed down, he slowed.They were clearing a path to the port, but if they thought that any of the citizens were getting too close, theyd probably open fire.They were definitely shooting anyone they ran into along the way.Theyd already shot two people whod run at them.Both had been vomiting brown goo.Where the hell did those vomit zombies come from so fast?Where the hell did those vomit zombies come from so fast?he said to Millers back.The detective shrugged with his left hand, his right still clutching his pistol.I dont think enough of that crap came out of Julie to infect the whole station, he replied without slowing down.Im guessing they were the first batch.The ones they incubated to get enough goo to infect the shelters with.That made sense.And when the controlled portion of the experiment went to shit, you just turned them loose on the populace.By the time people figured out what was going on, half of them were infected already.Then it was just a matter of time.They paused briefly at a corridor intersection, watching as the leader of the merc group stopped a hundred meters ahead and talked on his radio for a minute.Holden was gasping and trying to catch his breath when the group started up again, and Miller moved to follow.He reached out and grabbed the detectives belt and let Miller drag him along.Where did the skinny Belter keep this reserve of energy?The detective stopped.His expression was blank.Theyre arguing, Miller said.Huh?The leader of that group and some of the men.Arguing about something, Miller replied.So?Holden asked, then coughed something wet into his hand.He wiped it off on the back of his pants, not looking to see if it was blood.Please dont let it be blood.Miller shrugged with his hand again.I dont think everyones on the same team here, he said.The merc group turned down another corridor, and Miller followed, yanking Holden along behind him.These were the outer levels, filled with warehouse space and ship repair and resupply depots.They didnt see a lot of foot traffic at the best of times.Now the corridor echoed like a mausoleum with their footsteps.Up ahead, the merc group turned again, and before Miller and Holden could reach the junction, a lone figure wandered into view.He didnt appear to be armed, so Miller moved toward him cautiously, impatiently reaching behind himself and pulling Holdens hand off his belt.Once he was free, Miller held up his left hand in an unmistakably cop like gesture.This is a dangerous place to be wandering around, sir, he said.The man was now less than fifteen meters ahead of them and began moving toward them at a lurch.He was dressed for a party in a cheap tuxedo with a frilly shirt and sparkly red bow tie.He was wearing one shiny black shoe, the other foot covered with only a red sock.Brown vomit trickled from the corners of his mouth and stained the front of his white shirt.Shit, Miller said, and brought up his gun.Holden grabbed his arm and yanked it back down.Hes innocent in this, Holden said, the sight of the injured and infected man making his eyes burn.Hes innocent.Hes still coming, Miller said.So walk faster, Holden said.And if you shoot anyone else and I havent given you permission to, you dont get a ride on my ship.Got me?Trust me, Miller said.Dying is the best thing that could happen to that guy today.Youre not doing him any favors.You dont get to decide that, Holden replied, his tone edging into real anger.Miller started to reply, but Holden held up one hand and cut him off.You want on the Roci?Im the boss, then.No questions, no bullshit.Millers smirk turned into a smile.Yes, sir, he said.Our mercs are getting ahead of us.He pointed down the corridor.Miller nodded and moved off again at his steady, machinelike pace.Holden didnt turn around, but he could hear the man Miller had almost shot crying in the corridor behind him for a long time.To cover up the sound, which probably existed only in his head once theyd made a couple more turns in the corridor, he began humming the theme to Misko and Marisko again.Mother Elise, whod been the one to stay home with him when he was very young, had always brought him something to eat while he watched, and then sat by him with her hand on his head, playing with his hair.Shed laughed at the dinosaur antics even harder than he had.One Halloween shed made him a big pink hat to wear so that he could be the evil Count Mungo.Why had that guy been trying to capture the dinosaurs, anyway?It had never really been clear.Maybe he just liked dinosaurs.One time hed used a shrink ray and   Holden slammed into Millers back.The detective had stopped suddenly and now moved quickly to one side of the corridor, crouching low to keep himself in the shadows.Holden followed suit.About thirty meters ahead, the mercenary group had gotten much bigger and had split into two factions.Yep, Miller said.Whole lot of people having really bad days today.Holden nodded and wiped something wet off his face.It was blood.He didnt think hed hit Millers back hard enough to bloody his nose, and he had a suspicion it wasnt going to stop on its own.Mucous membranes getting fragile.Wasnt that part of radiation burning?He tore strips off his shirt and stuffed them up his nostrils while he watched the scene at the end of the corridor.There were two clear groups, and they did seem to be engaged in some sort of heated argument.Normally, that would have been fine.Holden didnt care about the social lives of mercenaries.But these mercenaries numbered by this time close to a hundred, were heavily armed, and blocked the corridor that led to his ship.That made their argument worth watching.Not everyone from Protogen left, I think, Miller said quietly, pointing at one of the two groups.Those guys on the right dont look like the home team.Holden looked at the group and nodded.They were definitely the more professional looking soldiers.Their armor fit well.The other group looked like it was largely made up of guys dressed in police riot gear, with only a few men in combat armor.Want to guess what the argument is about?Miller asked.Hey, can we have a ride too?Holden said mockingly with a Ceres accent.Uh, no, we need you guys to stay here and, uh, keep an eye on things, which we promise will be totally safe and absolutely not involve you turning into vomit zombies.He actually got a chuckle from Miller and then the corridor erupted in a barrage of gunfire.Both sides of the discussion were firing automatic weapons at each other from point blank range.The noise was deafening.Men screamed and flew apart, spraying the corridor and each other with blood and body parts.Holden dropped flat to the floor but continued watching the firefight.After the initial barrage, the survivors from both groups began falling back in opposite directions, still firing as they moved.The floor at the corridor junction was littered with bodies.Holden estimated that twenty or more men had died in that first second of the fight.The sounds of gunfire grew more distant as the two groups fired at each other down the corridor.In the middle of the junction, one of the bodies on the floor suddenly stirred and raised its head.Even before the wounded man could get to his feet, a bullet hole appeared in the middle of his face shield and he dropped back to the floor with limp finality.Wheres your ship?Miller asked.The lift is at the end of this corridor, Holden replied.Miller spat what looked like bloody phlegm on the floor.And the corridor that crosses it is now a war zone, with armed camps sniping at each other from both sides, he said.I guess we could try just running through it.Is there another option?Holden asked.Miller looked at his terminal.Were fifty three minutes past the deadline Naomi set, he said.How much more time do you want to waste?Look, I was never particularly good at math, Holden said.But Id guess there are as many as forty guys in either direction down that other corridor.A corridor which is a good three, maybe three and a half meters wide.Which means that we give eighty guys three meters worth of shots at us.Even dumb luck means we get hit a lot and then die.Lets think of a plan B.   As if to underline his argument, another fusillade broke out in the cross corridor, gouging chunks out of the rubbery wall insulation and chewing up the bodies lying on the floor.Theyre still withdrawing, Miller said.Those shots came from farther away.I guess we can just wait them out.I mean, if we can.The rags Holden had stuffed up his nose hadnt stopped the bleeding; they had just dammed it up.He could feel a steady trickle down the back of his throat that made his stomach heave with nausea.Miller was right.They were getting down to the last of their ability to wait anyone out at this point.Goddamn, I wish we could call and see if Naomi is even there, Holden said, looking at the flashing Network Not Available on his terminal.Shhh, Miller whispered, putting one finger on his lips.He pointed back down the corridor in the direction theyd come, and now Holden could hear heavy footsteps approaching.Late guests to the party, Miller said, and Holden nodded.The two men swiveled around, pointing their guns down the corridor and waiting.A group of four men in police riot armor rounded the corner.They didnt have their guns out, and two of them had their helmets off.Apparently they hadnt heard about the new hostilities.Holden waited for Miller to fire and, when he didnt, turned to look at him.Miller was staring back.I didnt dress real warm, Miller said, almost apologetically.It took Holden half a second to understand what he meant.Holden gave him permission by shooting first.He targeted one of the mafia thugs without a helmet and shot him in the face, then continued firing at the group until his guns slide locked open when the magazine was empty.Miller had begun firing a split second after Holdens first shot and also fired until his gun was empty.When it was over, all four thugs were lying facedown in the corridor.Holden let out a long breath that turned into a sigh, and sat down on the floor.Miller walked to the fallen men and nudged each one in turn with his foot as he replaced the magazine in his gun.Holden didnt bother reloading his.He was done with gunfights.He put the empty pistol in his pocket and got up to join the cop.He bent down and began unbuckling the least damaged armor he could find.Miller raised an eyebrow but didnt move to help.Were making a run for it, Holden said, swallowing back the vomit and blood taste in his throat as he pulled the chest and back armor free of the first man.But maybe if we wear this stuff, it will help.Might, Miller said with a nod, then knelt down to help strip a second man.Holden put on the dead mans armor, working hard to believe that the pink trail down the back was absolutely not part of the mans brain.Undoing the straps was exhausting.His fingers felt numb and awkward.He picked up the thigh armor, then put it down again.Hed rather run fast.Miller had finished buckling his on too and picked up one of the undamaged helmets.Holden found one with just a dent in it and slipped it onto his head.It felt greasy inside, and he was glad he had no sense of smell.He suspected that its previous occupant hadnt bathed often.Miller fiddled with the side of his helmet until the radio came on.The cops voice was echoed a split second later over the helmets tinny speakers as he said, Hey, were coming out into the corridor!Dont shoot!Were coming to join up!Thumbing off the mic, he turned to Holden and said, Well, maybe one side wont be shooting at us now.They moved back down the corridor and stopped ten meters from the intersection.Holden counted down from three and then took off at the best run he could manage.It was dishearteningly slow; his legs felt like they were filled with lead.Like he was running in a pool of water.Like he was in a nightmare.He could hear Miller just behind him, his shoes slapping on the concrete floor, his breath coming in ragged gasps.Then he heard only the sound of gunfire.He couldnt tell if Millers plan had worked.Couldnt tell which direction the gunfire was coming from.It was constant and deafening and started the instant he entered the cross corridor.When he was three meters from the other side, he lowered his head and jumped forward.In Eros light gravity, he seemed to fly, and he was nearly to the other side when a burst of bullets caught him in the armor over his ribs and slammed him into the corridor wall with a spine jarring crack.He dragged himself the rest of the way as bullets continued to hit all around his legs, one of them passing through the meaty part of his calf.Miller tripped over him, flying a few feet farther down the hall and then collapsing in a heap.Holden crawled to his side.Still alive?Miller nodded.Got shot.Arms broke.Keep moving, he gasped out.Holden climbed to his feet, his left leg feeling like it was on fire as the muscle in his calf clenched around his gaping wound.He pulled Miller up and then leaned on him as they limped toward the elevator.Millers left arm was dangling boneless at his side, and blood was pouring off his hand.Holden punched the button to call the lift, and he and Miller leaned on each other while they waited.He hummed the Misko and Marisko theme to himself, and after a few seconds, Miller started too.Holden punched the button for the Rocinantes berth and waited for the elevator to stop at a blank gray airlock door with no ship beyond it.That would be when he finally had permission to lie down on the floor and die.He looked forward to that moment when his exertions could end with a relief that would have surprised him if hed still been capable of surprise.Miller let go of him and slid down the lift wall, leaving a blood trail on the shiny metal and ending in a pile on the floor.The mans eyes were closed.He could almost have been sleeping.Holden watched the detectives chest rise and fall in ragged, painful breaths that grew smoother and more shallow.Holden envied him, but he had to see that closed airlock door before he could lie down.He began to feel faintly angry with the elevator for taking so long.It stopped, lift doors sliding open with a cheerful ding.Amos stood in the airlock on the other side, an assault rifle in each hand and two belts of magazines for the rifles slung on his shoulders.He looked Holden up and down once, then glanced over to Miller and back again.Jesus, Captain, you look like shit.Millers mind reassembled slowly and with several false starts.In his dreams, he was fitting a puzzle together as the pieces kept changing shape, and each time, just as he was on the verge of slipping the whole mechanism together, the dream began again.The first thing he became aware of was the ache at the small of his back, then the heaviness of his arms and legs, then the nausea.The nearer he came to consciousness, the more he tried to postpone it.Imaginary fingers tried to complete the puzzle, and before he could make it all fit, his eyes opened.He couldnt move his head.Something was in his neck: a thick bundle of black tubes reaching out of him and up past the limits of his vision.He tried to lift his arms, to push the invading, vampiric thing away, but he couldnt.It got me, he thought with a thrill of fear.Im infected.The woman appeared from his left.He was surprised she wasnt Julie.Deep brown skin, dark eyes with just a hint of an epicanthic fold.She smiled at him.Black hair draped down the side of her face.Down.There was a down.There was gravity.They were under thrust.That seemed very important, but he didnt know why.Hey, Detective, Naomi said.Welcome back.Where am I?he tried to say.His throat felt solid.Crowded like too many people in a tube station.Dont try to get up or talk or anything, she said.Youve been under for about thirty six hours.Good news is we have a sick bay with a military grade expert system and supplies for fifteen Martian soldiers.I think we burned half of what weve got on you and the captain.The captain.Holden.That was right.Theyd been in a fight.There had been a corridor and people shooting.And someone had been sick.He remembered a woman, covered in brown vomit, with vacant eyes, but he didnt know whether it was part of a nightmare.Naomi was still talking.Something about full plasma flushes and cell damage.He tried to lift a hand, to reach out to her, but a strap restrained him.The ache in his back was his kidneys, and he wondered what exactly was getting filtered out of his blood.Miller closed his eyes, asleep before he could decide whether to rest.No dreams troubled him this time.He roused again when something deep in his throat shifted, pulled at his larynx, and retreated.Without opening his eyes, he rolled to his side, coughed, puked, and rolled back.When he woke, he was breathing on his own.His throat felt sore and abused, but his hands werent tied down.Drainage tubes ran out of his belly and side, and there was a catheter the size of a pencil coming out his penis.Nothing particularly hurt, so he had to assume he was on pretty nearly all the narcotics there were.His clothes were gone, his modesty preserved only by a thin paper gown and a cast that held his left arm stony and immovable.Someone had put his hat on the next bed over.The sick bay, now that he could see it, looked like a ward on a high production entertainment feed.It wasnt a hospital; it was the matte black and silver idea of what a hospital was supposed to be.The monitors hung suspended in the air on complex armatures, reporting his blood pressure, nucleic acid concentrations, oxygenation, fluid balance.There were two separate countdowns running, one to the next round of autophagics, the other for pain medication.And across the aisle, at another station, Holdens statistics looked more or less the same.Holden looked like a ghost.His skin was pale and his sclera were red with a hundred little hemorrhages.His face was puffy from steroids.Hey, Miller said.Holden lifted a hand, waving gently.We made it, Miller said.His voice sounded like it had been dragged down an alley by its ankles.Yeah, Holden said.That was ugly.Yeah.Miller nodded.That had taken all the energy he had.He lay back down and fell, if not asleep, at least unconscious.Just before his mind flickered back into forgetfulness, he smiled.Hed made it.He was on Holdens ship.And they were going to find whatever Julie had left behind for them.Voices woke him.Maybe you shouldnt, then.It was the woman.Naomi.Part of Miller cursed her for disturbing him, but there was a buzz in her voice not fear or anger, but close enough to be interesting.He didnt move, didnt even swim all the way back to awareness.But he listened.I need to, Holden said.He sounded phlegmy, like someone who needed to cough.What happened on Eros its put a lot of things in perspective.Ive been a holding something back.Captain   No, hear me out.When I was in there thinking that all I was going to have left was half an hour of rigged pachinko games and then death when that happened, I knew what my regrets were.You know?I felt all the things that I wished Id done and never had the courage for.Now that I know, I cant just ignore it.I cant pretend it isnt there.Captain, Naomi said again, and the buzz in her voice was stronger.Dont say it, you poor bastard, Miller thought.Im in love with you, Naomi, Holden said.The pause lasted no longer than a heartbeat.No, sir, she said.You arent.I am.I know what youre thinking.Ive been through this big traumatic experience and Im doing the whole thing where I want to affirm life and make connections, and maybe some of thats part of it.But you have to believe that I know what I feel.And when I was down there, I knew that the thing that I wanted the most was to get back to you.Captain.How long have we served together?What?I dont know exactly   Ballpark estimate.Eight and a half runs makes it almost five years, Holden said.Miller could hear the confusion in his voice.All right.And in that time, how many of the crew did you share bunks with?Does it matter?Only a little.A few.More than a dozen?No, he said, but he didnt sound sure.Lets call it ten, Naomi said.Okay.But this is different.Im not talking about having a little shipboard romance to pass the time.Ever since   Miller imagined the woman holding up her hand or taking Holdens or maybe just glaring at him.Something to stop the flow of words.And do you know when I fell for you, sir?Sorrow.That was what the strain in her voice was.Sorrow.Disappointment.Regret.When when you   I can tell you the day, Naomi said.You were about seven weeks into that first run.I was still smarting that some Earther had come in from out of the ecliptic and taken my XO job.I didnt like you much right at the start.You were too charming, too pretty, and too damn comfortable in my chair.But there was a poker game in the engine room.You and me and those two Luna boys out of engineering and Kamala Trask.You remember Trask?She was the comm tech.The one who was   Built like a refrigerator?Face like a bulldog puppy?I remember her.She had the biggest crush on you.Used to cry herself to sleep at night all through that run.She wasnt in that game because she cared about poker.She just wanted to breathe some of your air, and everyone knew it.Even you.And all that night, I watched you and her, and you never once led her along.You never gave her any reason to think she had a chance with you.And you still treated her with respect.That was the first time I thought you might be a decent XO, and it was the first time I wished that I could be the girl in your bunk at shifts end.Because of Trask?That and youve got a great ass, sir.My point is we flew together for four years and more.And I would have come along with you any day of that if youd asked me.I didnt know, Holden said.He sounded a little strangled.You didnt ask.You always had your sights set someplace else.And, honestly, I think Belter women just put you off.Until the Cant Until it was just the five of us.Ive seen you looking at me.I know exactly what those looks mean, because I spent four years on the other side of them.But I only got your attention when I was the only female on board, and thats not good enough for me.I dont know   No, sir, you dont.Thats my point.Ive watched you seduce a lot of women, and I know how you do it.You get fixed on her, you get excited by her.Then you convince yourself that the two of you have some kind of special connection, and by the time you believe it, she usually thinks its true too.And then you sleep together for a while, and the connection gets a little faded.One or the other of you says something like professional or appropriate boundaries or starts worrying what the crew will think, and the whole thing slides away.Afterwards they still like you.All of them.You do it all so well they dont even feel like they get to hate you for it.Thats not true.It is.And until you figure out that you dont have to love everyone you bed down with, Im never going to know whether you love me or just want to bed down.And I wont sleep with you until you know which it is.The smart money isnt on love.I was just   If you want to sleep with me, Naomi said, be honest.Respect me enough for that.Okay?Miller coughed.He hadnt meant to, hadnt even been aware he was going to.His belly went tight, his throat clamped down, and he coughed wet and deep.Once he started, it was hard to stop.He sat up, eyes watering from the effort.Holden was lying back on his bed.Naomi sat on the next bed over, smiling like there had been nothing to overhear.Holdens monitors showed an elevated heart rate and blood pressure.Miller could only hope the poor bastard hadnt gotten an erection with the catheter still in.Hey, Detective, Naomi said.Howre you feeling?Miller nodded.Ive felt worse, he said.Then, a moment later: No.I havent.But Im all right.How bad was it?Youre both dead, Naomi said.Seriously, we had to override the triage filters on both of you more than once.The expert system kept clicking you over into hospice care and shooting you full of morphine.She said it lightly, but he believed her.He tried to sit up.His body still felt terribly heavy, but he didnt know if it was from weakness or the ship thrust.Holden was quiet, jaw clamped tight.Miller pretended not to notice.Long term estimates?Youre both going to need to be checked for new cancers every month for the rest of your lives.The captain has a new implant where his thyroid used to be, since his real one was pretty much cooked down.We had to take out about a foot and a half of your small bowel that wouldnt stop bleeding.Youre both going to bruise easy for a while, and if you wanted kids, I hope you have some sperm in a bank someplace, because all your little soldiers have two heads now.Miller chuckled.His monitors blinked into alarm mode and then back out.You sound like you trained as a med tech, he said.Nope.Engineer.But Ive been reading the printouts every day, so Ive got the lingo down.I wish Shed was still here, she said, and sounded sad for the first time.That was the second time someone had mentioned Shed.There was a story there, but Miller let it drop.Hair going to fall out?he asked.Maybe, Naomi said.The system shot you full of the drugs that are supposed to stop that, but if the follicles die, they die.Well.Good thing Ive still got my hat.What about Eros?Naomis false light tone failed her.Its dead, Holden said from his bed, turning to look at Miller.I think we were the last ship out.The station isnt answering calls, and all the automatic systems have it in a quarantine lockdown.Rescue ships?Miller asked, and coughed again.His throat was still sore.Not going to happen, Naomi said.There were a million and a half people on station.No one has the resources to put into that kind of rescue op.After all, Holden said, theres a war on.* * *   The ship system dimmed the lights for night.Miller lay on his bed.The expert system had shifted his treatment regimen into a new phase, and for the past three hours, hed alternated between spiking fevers and teeth chattering chills.His teeth and the nail beds of his fingers and toes ached.Sleep wasnt an option, so he lay in the gloom and tried to pull himself together.He wondered what his old partners would have made of his behavior on Eros.Havelock.Muss.He tried to imagine them in his place.Hed killed people, and hed done it cold.Eros had been a kill box, and when the people in charge of the law wanted you dead, the law didnt apply anymore.And some of the dead assholes had been the ones whod killed Julie.So.Revenge killing.Was he really down to revenge killing?That was a sad thought.He tried to imagine Julie sitting beside him the way Naomi had with Holden.It was like shed been waiting for the invitation.Julie Mao, who hed never really known.She raised a hand in greeting.And what about us?he asked her as he looked into her dark, unreal eyes.Do I love you, or do I just want to love you so bad I cant tell the difference?Hey, Miller, Holden said, and Julie vanished.You awake?Yeah.Cant sleep.Me either.They were silent for a moment.The expert system hummed.Millers left arm itched under its cast as the tissue went through another round of forced regrowth.You doing okay?Miller asked.Why wouldnt I be?Holden said sharply.You killed that guy, Miller said.Back on the station.You shot him.I mean, I know you shot at guys before that.Back at the hotel.But right at the end there, you actually hit somebody in the face.Yeah.I did.You good with that?Sure, Holden said, too quickly.The air recyclers hummed, and the blood pressure cuff on Millers good arm squeezed him like a hand.Holden didnt speak, but when Miller squinted, he could see the elevated blood pressure and the uptick in brain activity.They always made us take time off, Miller said.What?When we shot someone.Whether they died or not, they always made us take a leave of absence.Turn in our weapon.Go talk to the headshrinker.Bureaucrats, Holden said.They had a point, Miller said.Shooting someone does something to you.Killing someone thats even worse.Doesnt matter that they had it coming or you didnt have a choice.Or maybe a little difference.But it doesnt take it away.Seems like you got over it, though.Maybe, Miller said.Look.All that I said back there about how you kill someone?About how leaving them alive wasnt doing them any favors?Im sorry that happened.You think you were wrong?I wasnt.But Im still sorry it happened.Okay.Jesus.Look, Im saying its good that it bothers you.Its good that you cant stop seeing it or hearing it.That part where it haunts you some?Thats the way its supposed to be.Holden was quiet for a moment.When he spoke again, his voice was gray as stone.Ive killed people before, you know.But they were blips in a radar track.I   Its not the same, is it?Miller said.No, it isnt, Holden replied.Does this go away?Sometimes, Miller thought.No, he said.Not if youve still got a soul.Okay.Thanks.One other thing?Yeah?I know its none of my business, but I really wouldnt let her put you off.So you dont understand sex and love and women.Just means you were born with a cock.And this girl?Naomi?She seems like shes worth putting a little effort into it.You know?Yeah, Holden said.Then: Can we never talk about that again?Sure.The ship creaked and gravity shifted a degree to Millers right.Course correction.Nothing interesting.Miller closed his eyes and tried to will himself to sleep.His mind was full of dead men and Julie and love and sex.There was something Holden had said about the war that was important, but he couldnt make the pieces fit.They kept changing.Miller sighed, shifted his weight so that he blocked one of his drainage tubes and had to shift back to stop the alarm.When the blood pressure cuff fired off again, it was Julie holding him, pulling herself so close her lips brushed his ear.His eyes opened, his mind seeing both the imaginary girl and the monitors that she would have blocked if shed really been there.I love you too, she said, and I will take care of you.He smiled at seeing the numbers change as his heart raced.For five more days, Holden and Miller lay on their backs in sick bay while the solar system burned down around them.The reports of Eros death ran from massive ecological collapse brought about by war related supply shortages, to covert Martian attack, to secret Belt bioweapon laboratory accident.Analysis from the inner planets had it that the OPA and terrorists like them had finally shown how dangerous they could be to innocent civilian populations.The Belt blamed Mars, or the maintenance crews of Eros, or the OPA for not stopping it.And then a group of Martian frigates blockaded Pallas, a revolt on Ganymede ended in sixteen dead, and the new government of Ceres announced that all ships with Martian registry docked on station were being commandeered.The threats and accusations, all set to the constant human background noise of war drums, moved on.Eros had been a tragedy and a crime, but it was finished, and there were new dangers popping up in every corner of human space.Holden turned off his newsfeed, fidgeted in his bunk, and tried to wake Miller up by staring at him.It didnt work.The massive radiation exposure had failed to give him superpowers.Miller began to snore.Holden sat up, testing the gravity.Less than a quarter g.  Alex wasnt in a hurry, then.Naomi was giving him and Miller time to heal before they arrived at Julies magical mystery asteroid.Shit.Naomi.The last few times shed come into sick bay had been awkward.She never brought the subject of his failed romantic gesture back up, but he could feel a barrier between them now that filled him with regret.And every time she left the room, Miller would look away from him and sigh, which just made it worse.But he couldnt avoid her forever, no matter how much he felt like an idiot.He swung his feet off the edge of the bed and pressed down on the floor.His legs felt weak but not rubbery.The soles of his feet hurt, but quite a bit less than nearly everything else on his body.He stood up, one hand still on the bed, and tested his balance.He wobbled but remained upright.Two steps reassured him that walking was possible in the light gravity.The IV tugged at his arm.He was down to just one bag of something a faint blue.He had no idea what it was, but after Naomis description of how close to death hed come, he figured it must be important.He pulled it off the wall hook and held it in his left hand.The room smelled like antiseptic and diarrhea.He was happy to be leaving.Where you going?Miller asked, his voice groggy.Out.Holden had the sudden, visceral memory of being fifteen.Okay, Miller said, then rolled onto his side.The sick bay hatch was four meters from the central ladder, and Holden covered the ground with a slow, careful shuffle, his paper booties making a whispery scuffing sound on the fabric covered metal floor.The ladder itself defeated him.Even though ops was only one deck up, the three meter climb might as well have been a thousand.He pressed the button to call the lift, and a few seconds later, the floor hatch slid open and the lift climbed through with an electric whine.Holden tried to hop on but managed only a sort of slow motion fall that ended with his clutching the ladder and kneeling on the lift platform.He stopped the lift, pulled himself upright, and started it again, then rode it up to the next deck in what he hoped was a less beaten and more captain like pose.Jesus, Captain, you still look like shit, Amos said as the lift came to a stop.The mechanic was sprawled across two chairs at the sensor stations and munching on what looked like a strip of leather.You keep saying that.Keeps bein true.Amos, dont you have work to do?Naomi said.She was sitting at one of the computer stations, watching something flash by on the screen.She didnt look up when Holden came onto the deck.That was a bad sign.Nope.Most boring ship I ever worked, Boss.She dont break, she dont leak, she dont even have an annoying rattle to tighten down, Amos replied as he sucked down the last of his snack and smacked his lips.Theres always mopping, Naomi said, then tapped out something on the screen in front of her.Amos looked from her to Holden and back again.Oh, that reminds me.I better get down to the engine room and look at that thing Ive been meaning to look at, Amos said, and jumped to his feet.Scuse me, Cap.He squeezed past Holden, hopped on the lift, and rode it sternward.The deck hatch closed behind him.Hey, Holden said to Naomi once Amos was gone.Hey, she said without turning around.That wasnt good either.When shed sent Amos away, hed hoped she wanted to talk.It didnt look like it.Holden sighed and shuffled over to the chair next to her.He collapsed into it, his legs tingling like hed run a kilometer instead of just walking twenty odd steps.Naomi had left her hair down, and it hid her face from him.Holden wanted to brush it back but was afraid shed snap his elbow with Belter kung fu if he tried.Look, Naomi, he started, but she ignored him and hit a button on her panel.He stopped when Freds face appeared on the display in front of her.Is that Fred?he said, because he couldnt think of anything even more idiotic to say.You should see this.Got it from Tycho a couple hours ago on the tightbeam after I sent them an update on our status.Naomi tapped the play button and Freds face sprang to life.Naomi, sounds like you guys have had a tough time of it.The airs full of chatter on the station shutdown, and the supposed nuclear explosion.No one knows what to make of it.Keep us informed.In the meantime, we managed to hack open that data cube you left here.I dont think itll help much, though.Looks like a bunch of sensor data from the Donnager, mostly EM stuff.Weve tried looking for hidden messages, but my smartest people cant find anything.Im passing the data along to you.Let me know if you find anything.Tycho out.The screen went blank.What does the data look like?Holden asked.Its just what the man said, Naomi said.EM sensor data from the Donnager during the pursuit by the six ships, and the battle itself.Ive dug through raw stuff, looking for anything hidden inside, but for the life of me, I cant find a thing.Ive even had the Roci digging through the data for the last couple hours, looking for patterns.She has really good software for that sort of thing.But so far, nothing.She tapped on the screen again and the raw data began spooling past faster than Holden could follow.In a small window inside the larger screen, the Rocinantes pattern recognition software worked to find meaning.Holden watched it for a minute, but his eyes quickly unfocused.Lieutenant Kelly died for this data, he said.He left the ship while his mates were still fighting.Marines dont do that unless it matters.Naomi shrugged and pointed at the screen with resignation.Thats what was on his cube, she said.Maybe theres something steganographic, but I dont have another dataset to compare it to.Holden began tapping on his thigh, his pain and romantic failures momentarily forgotten.So lets say that this data is all that it is.Theres nothing hidden.What would this information mean to the Martian navy?Naomi leaned back in her chair and closed her eyes in thought, one finger twisting and untwisting a curl of hair by her temple.Its mostly EM data, so lots of engine signature stuff.Drive radiation is the best way to keep track of other ships.So that tells you where which ships were during the fight.Tactical data?Maybe, Holden said.Would that be important enough to send Kelly out with?Naomi took a deep breath and let it out slowly.I dont think so, she said.Me either.Something tapped at the edge of his conscious mind, asking to be let in.What was that thing with Amos all about?he said.Amos?Him showing up at the airlock with two guns when we arrived, he said.There was some trouble on our trip back to the ship.Trouble for who?Holden asked.Naomi actually smiled at that.Some bad men didnt want us to hack the lockdown on the Roci.Amos talked it over with them.You didnt think it was because we were waiting for you, did you, sir?Was there a smile in her voice?A hint of coyness?Flirtation?He stopped himself from grinning.What did the Roci say about the data when you ran it?Holden asked.Here, Naomi replied, and hit something on her panel.The screen began displaying long lists of data in text.Lots of EM and light spectrum stuff, some leakage from damaged   Holden yelped.Naomi looked up at him.Im such an idiot, Holden said.Granted.Elaborate?Holden touched the screen and began scrolling up and down through the data.He tapped one long list of numbers and letters and leaned back with a grin.There, thats it, he said.Thats what?Hull structure isnt the only recognition metric.Its the most accurate, but its also got the shortest range and he gestured around him at the Rocinante is the easiest to fool.The next best method is drive signature.Cant mask your radiation and heat patterns.And theyre easy to spot even from really far away.Holden turned on the screen next to his chair and pulled up the ships friend/foe database, then linked it to the data on Naomis screen.Thats what this message is, Naomi.Its telling Mars who killed the Donnager by showing them what the drive signature was.Then why not just say, So and so killed us, in a nice easy to read text file?Naomi asked, a skeptical frown on her face.Holden leaned forward and paused, opened his mouth, then closed it and sat back again with a sigh.I dont know.A hatch banged open with a hydraulic whine; then Naomi looked past Holden to the ladder and said, Millers coming up.Holden turned to watch the detective finish the slow climb up from the sick bay deck.He looked like a plucked chicken, pink gray skin stippled with gooseflesh.His paper gown went poorly with the hat.Uh, theres a lift, Holden said.Wish Id known that, Miller replied, then dragged himself up onto the ops deck with a gasp.We there yet?Trying to figure out a mystery, Holden said.I hate mysteries, Miller said, then hauled himself to his feet and made his way to a chair.Then solve this one for us.You find out who murdered someone.You cant arrest them yourself, so you send the information to your partner.But instead of just sending the perps name, you send your partner all the clues.Why?Miller coughed and scratched his chin.His eyes were fixed on something, like he was reading a screen Holden couldnt see.Because I dont trust myself.I want my partner to arrive at the same conclusion I did, without my biasing him.I give him the dots, see what it looks like when he connects em.Especially if guessing wrong has consequences, Naomi said.You dont like to screw up a murder charge, Miller said with a nod.Looks unprofessional.Holdens panel beeped at him.Shit, I know why they were careful, he said after reading his screen.The Roci thinks those were standard light cruiser engines built by the Bush Shipyards.They were Earth ships?Naomi said.But they werent flying any colors, and Son of a bitch!It was the first time Holden had ever heard her yell, and he understood.If UNN black ops ships had killed the Donnager, then that meant Earth was behind the whole thing.Maybe even killing the Canterbury in the first place.It would mean that Martian warships were killing Belters for no reason.Belters like Naomi.Holden leaned forward and called up the comm display, then tapped out a general broadcast.Miller caught his breath.That button you just pressed doesnt do what I think it does, does it?he said.I finished Kellys mission for him, Holden said.I have no idea who the fuck Kelly is, Miller said, but please tell me that his mission wasnt broadcasting that data to the solar system at large.People need to know whats going on, Holden said.Yes, they do, but maybe we should actually know what the hell is going on before we tell them, Miller replied, all the weariness gone from his voice.How gullible are you?Hey, Holden said, but Miller got louder.You found a Martian battery, right?So you told everyone in the solar system about it and started the single largest war in human history.Only turns out the Martians maybe werent the ones that left it there.Then, a bunch of mystery ships kill the Donnager, which Mars blames on the Belt, only, dammit, the Belt didnt even know it was capable of killing a Martian battle cruiser.Holden opened his mouth, but Miller grabbed a bulb of coffee Amos had left behind on the console and threw it at his head.Let me finish!And now you find some data that implicates Earth.First thing you do is blab it to the universe, so that Mars and the Belt drag Earth into this thing, making the largest war of all time even bigger.Are you seeing a pattern here?Yes, Naomi said.So what do you thinks going to happen?Miller said.This is how these people work!They made the Canterbury look like Mars.It wasnt.They made the Donnager look like the Belt.It wasnt.Now it looks like the whole damn things Earth?Follow the pattern.It probably isnt!You never, never put that kind of accusation out there until you know the score.You look.You listen.Youre quiet, fercrissakes, and when you know, then you can make your case.The detective sat back, clearly exhausted.He was sweating.The deck was silent.You done?Holden said.Miller nodded, breathing heavily.Think I might have strained something.I havent accused anyone of doing anything, Holden said.Im not building a case.I just put the data out there.Now its not a secret.Theyre doing something on Eros.They dont want it interrupted.With Mars and the Belt shooting at each other, everyone with the resources to help is busy elsewhere.And you just dragged Earth into it, Miller said.Maybe, Holden said.But the killers did use ships that were built, at least in part, at Earths orbital shipyards.Maybe someone will look into that.And thats the point.If everyone knows everything, nothing stays secret.Yeah, well, Miller said.Holden ignored him  Eventually, someonell figure out the big picture.This kind of thing requires secrecy to function, so exposing all the secrets hurts them in the end.Its the only way this really, permanently stops.Miller sighed, nodded to himself, took off his hat, and scratched his scalp.I was just going to put em out an airlock, Miller said.* * *   BA834024112 wasnt much of an asteroid.Barely thirty meters across, it had long ago been surveyed and found completely devoid of useful or valuable minerals.It existed in the registry only to warn ships not to run into it.Julie had left it tethered to wealth measured in the billions when she flew her small shuttle to Eros.Up close, the ship that had killed the Scopuli and stolen its crew looked like a shark.It was long and lean and utterly black, almost impossible to see against the backdrop of space with the naked eye.Its radar deflecting curves gave it an aerodynamic look almost always lacking in space going vessels.It made Holdens skin crawl, but it was beautiful.Motherfucker, Amos said under his breath as the crew clustered in the cockpit of the Rocinante to look at it.The Roci doesnt even see it, Cap, Alex said.Im pourin ladar into it, and all we see is a slightly warmer spot on the asteroid.Like Becca saw just before the Cant died, Naomi said.Her shuttles been launched, so Im guessin this is the right stealth ship someone left tied to a rock, Alex added.Case theres more than one.Holden tapped his fingers on the back of Alexs chair for a moment as he floated over the pilots head.Its probably full of vomit zombies, Holden finally said.Want to go see?said Miller.Oh yeah, Holden said.The environment suit was better than Miller was used to.Hed only done a couple walks outside during his years on Ceres, and the Star Helix equipment had been old back then: thick corrugated joints, separable air supply unit, gloves that left his hands thirty degrees colder than the rest of his body.The Rocinantes suits were military and recent, no bulkier than standard riot gear, with integrated life support that could probably keep fingers warm after a hand got shot off.Miller floated, one hand on a strap in the airlock, and flexed his fingers, watching the sharkskin pattern of the knuckle joints.It didnt feel like enough.All right, Alex, Holden said.Were in place.Have the Roci knock for us.A deep, rumbling vibration shook them.Naomi put a hand against the airlocks curved wall to steady herself.Amos shifted forward to take point, a reactionless automatic rifle in his hands.When he bent his neck, Miller could hear the vertebrae cracking through his radio.It was the only way he could have heard it; they were already in vacuum.Okay, Captain, Alex said.Ive got a seal.The standard security override isnt working, so give me a second to   Problem?Holden said.Got it.Ive got it.We have a connection, Alex said.Then, a moment later: Ah.It doesnt look like theres much to breathe over there.Anything?Holden asked.Nope.Hard vacuum, Alex said.Both her lock doors are open.All right, folks, Holden said, keep an eye on your air supply.Lets go.Miller took a long breath.The external airlock went from soft red to soft green.Holden slid it open, and Amos launched forward, the captain just behind him.Miller gestured to Naomi with a nod.Ladies first.The connecting gantry was reinforced, ready to deflect enemy lasers or slow down slugs.Amos landed on the other ship as the hatch to the Rocinante closed behind them.Miller had a moments vertigo, the ship before them suddenly clicking from ahead to down in his perception, as if they were falling into something.You all right?Naomi asked.Miller nodded, and Amos passed into the other ships hatch.One by one, they went in.The ship was dead.The lights coming off their environment suits played over the soft, almost streamlined curves of the bulkheads, the cushioned walls, the gray suit lockers.One locker was bent out of shape, like someone or something had forced its way out from within.Amos pushed off slow.Under normal circumstances, hard vacuum would have been assurance enough that nothing was about to jump out at them.Right now, Miller figured it was only even money.Whole place is shut down, Holden said.Might be backups in the engine room, Amos said.So the ass end of the ship from here, Holden said.Pretty much.Lets be careful, Holden said.Im heading up to ops, Naomi said.If theres anything running off battery, I can   No, you arent, Holden said.We arent splitting up the group until we know what were looking at.Stay together.Amos moved down, sinking into the darkness.Holden pushed off after him.Miller followed.He couldnt tell from Naomis body language whether she was annoyed or relieved.The galley was empty, but signs of struggle showed here and there.A chair with a bent leg.A long, jagged scratch down the wall where something sharp had flaked the paint.Two bullet holes set high along one bulkhead where a shot had gone wide.Miller put a hand out, grabbed one of the tables, and swung slowly.Miller?Holden said.Are you coming?Look at this, Miller said.The dark spill was the color of amber, flaky and shining like glass in his flashlight beam.Holden hovered closer.Zombie vomit?Holden said.Think so.Well.I guess were on the right ship.For some value of right.The crew quarters hung silent and empty.They went through each of them, but there were no personal markings no terminals, no pictures, no clues to the names of the men and women who had lived and breathed and presumably died on the ship.Even the captains cabin was indicated only by a slightly larger bunk and the face of a locked safe.There was a massive central compartment as high and wide as the hull of the Rocinante, the darkness dominated by twelve huge cylinders encrusted with narrow catwalks and scaffolds.Miller saw Naomis expression harden.What are they?Miller asked.Torpedo tubes, she said.Torpedo tubes?he said.Jesus Christ, how many are they packing?A million?Twelve, she said.Just twelve.Capital ship busters, Amos said.Built to pretty much kill whatever youre aiming at with the first shot.Something like the Donnager?Miller asked.Holden looked back at him, the glow of his heads up display lighting his features.Or the Canterbury, he said.The four of them passed between the wide black tubes in silence.In the machine and fabrication shops, the signs of violence were more pronounced.There was blood on the floor and walls, along with wide swaths of the glassy gold resin that had once been vomit.A uniform lay in a ball.The cloth had been wadded and soaked in something before the cold of space had frozen it.Habits formed from years of walking through crime scenes put a dozen small things in place: the pattern of scratches on the floor and lift doors, the spatter of blood and vomit, the footprints.They all told the story.Theyre in engineering, Miller said.Who?Holden said.The crew.Whoever was on the ship.All except that one, he said, gesturing at half a footprint that led toward the lift.You see how her footprints are over the top of everything else.And there, where she stepped in that blood, it was already dry.Flaked instead of smearing.How you know it was a girl?Holden asked.Because it was Julie, Miller said.Well, whoevers in there, theyve been sucking vacuum for a long time, Amos said.Want to go see?No one said yes, but they all floated forward.The hatch stood open.If the darkness beyond it seemed more solid, more ominous, more personal than the rest of the dead ship had, it was only Millers imagination playing tricks.He hesitated, trying to summon up the image of Julie, but she wouldnt come.Floating into the engineering deck was like swimming into a cave.Miller saw the other flashlights playing over walls and panels, looking for live controls, or else controls that could come alive.He aimed his own beam into the body of the room, the dark swallowing it.We got batteries, Capn, Amos said.And looks like the reactor got shut down.Intentional.Think you can get it back up?Want to run some diagnostics, Amos said.There could be a reason they shut it off, and I dont want to find out the hard way.Good point.But I can at least get us some come on, you bastard.All around the deck, blue white lights flared up.The sudden brilliance blinded Miller for a half second.His vision returned with a sense of growing confusion.Naomi gasped, and Holden yelped.Something in the back of Millers own mind started to shriek, and he forced it into silence.It was just a crime scene.They were only bodies.Except they werent.The reactor stood before him, quiescent and dead.All around it, a layer of human flesh.He could pick out arms, hands with fingers splayed so wide they hurt to look at.The long snake of a spine curved, ribs fanning out like the legs of some perverse insect.He tried to make what he was seeing make sense.Hed seen men eviscerated before.He knew that the long, ropy swirl to the left of the thing were intestines.He could see where the small bowel widened to become a colon.The familiar shape of a skull looked out at him.But then, among the familiar anatomy of death and dismemberment, there were other things: nautilus spirals, wide swaths of soft black filament, a pale expanse of something that might have been skin cut by a dozen gill like vents, a half formed limb that looked equally like an insect and a fetus without being either one.The frozen, dead flesh surrounded the reactor like the skin of an orange.The crew of the stealth ship.Maybe of the Scopuli as well.All but Julie.Yeah, Amos said.This could take a little longer than I was thinking, Cap.Its okay, Holden said.His voice on the radio sounded shaky.You dont have to.Its no trouble.As long as none of that freaky shit broke the containment, reactor should boot up just fine.You dont mind being around it?Holden said.Honest, Capn, Im not thinking about it.Give me twenty minutes, Ill tell you if we got power or if we have to patch a line over from the Roci.Okay, Holden said.And then again, his voice more solid: Okay, but dont touch any of that.Wasnt going to, Amos said.They floated back out through the hatch, Holden and Naomi and Miller coming last.Is that  Naomi said, then coughed and started again.Is that whats happening on Eros?Probably, Miller said.Amos, Holden said.Do you have enough battery power to light up the computers?There was a pause.Miller took a deep breath, the plastic and ozone scent of the suits air system filling his nose.I think so, Amos said dubiously.But if we can get the reactor up first   Bring up the computers.Youre the captain, Capn, Amos said.Have it to you in five.In silence, they floated up back to the airlock, and past it to the operations deck.Miller hung back, watching the way Holdens trajectory kept him near Naomi and then away from her.Protective and head shy both, Miller thought.Bad combination.Julie was waiting in the airlock.Not at first, of course.Miller slid back into the space, his mind churning through everything hed seen, just like it was a case.A normal case.His gaze drifted toward the broken locker.There was no suit in it.For a moment, he was back on Eros, in the apartment where Julie had died.There had been an environment suit there.And then Julie was there with him, pushing her way out of the locker.What were you doing there?he thought.No brig, he said.What?Holden said.I just noticed, Miller said.Ships got no brig.They arent built to carry prisoners.Holden made a low agreeing grunt.Makes you wonder what they were planning to do with the crew of the Scopuli, Naomi said.The tone of her voice meant she didnt wonder at all.I dont think they were, Miller said slowly.This whole thing they were improvising.Improvising?Naomi said.Ship was carrying an infectious something or other without enough containment to contain it.Taking on prisoners without a brig to hold em in.They were making this up as they went along.Or they had to hurry, Holden said.Something happened that made them hurry.But what they did on Eros must have taken months to arrange.Maybe years.So maybe something happened at the last minute?Be interesting to know what, Miller said.Compared to the rest of the ship, the ops deck looked peaceful.Normal.The computers had finished their diagnostics, screens glowing placidly.Naomi went to one, holding the back of the chair with one hand so the gentle touch of her fingers against the screen wouldnt push her backward.Ill do what I can here, she said.You can check the bridge.There was a pause that carried weight.Ill be fine, Naomi said.All right.I know youll I Cmon, Miller.Miller let the captain float ahead into the bridge.The screens there were spooling through diagnostics so standard Miller recognized them.It was a wider space than hed imagined, with five stations with crash couches customized for other peoples bodies.Holden strapped in at one.Miller took a slow turn around the deck.Nothing seemed out of place here no blood, no broken chairs or torn padding.When it happened, the fight had been down near the reactor.He wasnt sure yet what that meant.He sat at what, under a standard layout, would have been the security station, and opened a private channel to Holden.Anything youre looking for in particular?Briefings.Overviews, Holden said shortly.Whatevers useful.You?See if I can get into the internal monitors.Hoping to find?What Julie found, Miller said.The security assumed that anyone sitting at the console had access to the low level feeds.It still took half an hour to parse the command structure and query interface.Once Miller had that down, it wasnt hard.The time stamp on the log listed the feed as the day the Scopuli had gone missing.The security camera in the airlock bay showed the crew Belters, most of them being escorted in.Their captors were in armor, with faceplates lowered.Miller wondered if theyd meant to keep their identities secret.That would almost have suggested they were planning to keep the crew alive.Or maybe they were just wary of some last minute resistance.The crew of the Scopuli werent wearing environment suits or armor.A couple of them werent even wearing uniforms.But Julie was.It was strange, watching her move.With a sense of dislocation, Miller realized that hed never actually seen her in motion.All the pictures hed had in his file back on Ceres had been stills.Now here she was, floating with her chosen compatriots, her hair back out of her eyes, her jaw clamped.She looked very small surrounded by her crew and the men in armor.The little rich girl whod turned her back on wealth and status to be with the downtrodden Belt.The girl whod told her mother to sell the Razorback the ship shed loved rather than give in to emotional blackmail.In motion, she looked a little different from the imaginary version hed built of her the way she pulled her shoulders back, the habit of reaching her toes toward the floor even in null g but the basic image was the same.He felt like he was filling in blanks with the new details rather than reimagining the woman.The guards said something the security feeds audio was playing to vacuum and the Scopuli crew looked aghast.Then, hesitantly, the captain started taking his uniform off.They were stripping the prisoners.Miller shook his head.Bad plan.What?Holden said.Nothing.Sorry.Julie wasnt moving.One of the guards moved toward her, his legs braced on the wall.Julie, whod lived through being raped, maybe, or something as bad.Whod studied jiu jitsu to feel safe afterward.Maybe they thought she was just being modest.Maybe they were afraid she was hiding a weapon under her clothes.Either way, they tried to force the point.One of the guards pushed her, and she latched on to his arm like her life depended on it.Miller winced when he saw the mans elbow bend the wrong way, but he also smiled.Thats my girl, he thought.Give em hell.And she did.For almost forty seconds, the airlock bay was a battleground.Even some of the cowed Scopuli crew tried to join in.But then Julie didnt see a thick shouldered man launch from behind her.Miller felt it when the gauntleted hand hammered Julies temple.She wasnt out, but she was groggy.The men with guns stripped her with a cold efficiency, and when there were no weapons or comm devices, they handed her a jumpsuit and shoved her in a locker.The others, they led down into the ship.Miller matched time stamps and switched feeds.The prisoners were taken to the galley, then bound to the tables.One of the guards spent a minute or so talking, but with his faceplate down, the only clues Miller had to the content of the sermon were the reactions of the crew wide eyed disbelief, confusion, outrage, and fear.The guard could have been saying anything.Miller started skipping.
