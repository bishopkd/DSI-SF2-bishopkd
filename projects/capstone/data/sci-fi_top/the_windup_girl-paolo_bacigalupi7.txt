Kanya can't breathe.Will he simply strangle her here, to pay her back for her betrayals?Her guide stops."Are you sick?"he asks.Jaidee is gone.Kanya's heart is pounding.She's sweating.If she were any further into containment, she would have to ask to be quarantined, beg not to be let out, to accept that some bacteria or virus had made the jump and that she was going to die."I'm " she gags, remembering the blood on the steps of General Pracha's administrative building.Jaidee's dismembered body, a careful brutal package.Ragged death."Do you need a doctor?"Kanya tries to control her breathing.Jaidee is haunting her.His phii following her.She tries to control her fear."I'm fine. "She nods to the guide."Let's go.Finish this now. "A minute later the guide indicates a door and nods that Kanya should step through.As Kanya opens the door, Ratana looks up from her files.Smiles slightly in the glow of her monitor.The computers down here all have large screens.Some of them are models that haven't existed in fifty years and burn more energy than five new ones, but they do their work and in return are meticulously maintained.Still, the amount of power burning through them makes Kanya weak in the knees.She can almost see the ocean rising in response.It's a horrifying thing to stand beside."Thank you for coming," Ratana says."Of course I came. "No mention of earlier trysts.No mention of shared history, gone awry.That Kanya could not play tom and dee with one she would inevitably betray.That was too much hypocrisy, even for Kanya.And yet Ratana is still beautiful.Kanya remembers laughing with her, taking a skiff out across the Chao Phraya and watching paper boats glowing all around them during Loi Kratong.Remembers the feel of Ratana curled against her as the waves lapped and as thousands of little candles burned, the city's wishes and prayers blanketing the waters.Ratana motions her over.Shows her a set of photos on her screen.She catches sight of Kanya's captain's tags on her white collar."I'm sorry about Jaidee.He was good. "Kanya grimaces, trying to shake off the memory of his phii in the halls outside."He was better than that. "She studies the bodies that glow in front of her."What am I seeing?""Two men.From two different hospitals. ""Yes?""They had something in them.Something worrisome.It seems to be a variant of blister rust. ""Yes?And?They ate something tainted.They died.So?"Ratana shakes her head."It was hosted in them.Propagating.I've never seen it host itself in a mammal. "Kanya looks over the hospital records."Who are they?""We don't know. ""No family visited them?No one saw them arrive?They didn't say?""One was incoherent when he was admitted.The other was already deep into blister rust collapse. ""You're sure they didn't just eat tainted fruit?"Ratana shrugs.Her skin is smooth and pale from a life underground.Not like Kanya whose skin has darkened like a peasant's in the harsh sun of active patrol.And yet Kanya would always choose to work above ground, not down here, in the darkness.Ratana is the brave one.Kanya is sure of it.She wonders what personal demons have driven Ratana to work in this hellish place.When they were together, Ratana never talked about her past.About her losses.But they are there.They have to be, like rocks under the waves and froth of a coastline.There are always rocks."No, of course I'm not sure.Not one hundred percent. ""Fifty percent?"She shrugs again, uncomfortable, goes back to her papers."You know I can't make assertions like that.But the virus is different, the protein alterations in their samples are variants.The breakdown of the tissue doesn't match the standard fingerprint of blister rust.In testing, it conforms to blister rusts we've seen before.AgriGen and TotalNutrient variations, AG134.s and TN249.x. d Both of them offer strong similarities. "She pauses."Yes?""But it was in the lungs. ""Cibiscosis, then. ""No.It was blister rust. "Ratana looks at Kanya."You see the problem?""And we know nothing about their history, their travel?Were they abroad maybe?On a clipper ship?Crossing into Burma.Over into South China?They're not from the same village, perhaps?"Ratana shrugs."We have no history for either of them.Just the sickness to link them.We used to have a population database with DNA records, family history, work and housing data, but they were taken offline to provide more processing power for pre emptive research. "She shrugs."In any case, so few people were bothering to register, it didn't make any sense. ""So we have nothing.Any other cases?""No. ""You mean not so far. ""This is beyond me here.We only noticed it because of the crackdowns.The hospitals are reporting everything, far more than they normally do, just to show that they're compliant.It was an accident that they reported and another that I noticed it in all the other reports that are coming in.We need Gi Bu Sen's help. "Kanya's skin crawls."Jaidee's dead.Gi Bu Sen won't help us now. ""Sometimes he takes an interest.Not just in his own research.With this, it's possible. "She looks up at Kanya, hopeful."You went with Jaidee before.You saw him convince the man.Perhaps he will take an interest in you, too?""It's doubtful. ""Look at this. "Ratana shuffles through the medical charts."It has the markings of an engineered virus.DNA shifts don't look like ones that would reproduce in the wild.Blister rust has no reason to jump the animal kingdom barrier.Nothing is encouraging it, it is not easily transferred.The differences are marked.It's as though we're looking into its future.At what it will be like after being reborn 10,000 times.It's a true puzzle.And truly worrisome. ""If you're right, we're all dead.General Pracha will have to be briefed.The palace told. ""Quietly," Ratana begs.She reaches out, grasps Kanya's sleeve, her face anguished."I could still be wrong. ""You aren't. ""I don't know that it can jump, or how readily.I want you to go to Gi Bu Sen.He will know. "Kanya makes a face."All right.I'll try.In the meantime, put out word to the hospitals and street clinics to look out for more symptoms.Draw up a list.With everyone already worried about crackdowns, it won't even look suspicious for us to demand more information from them.They'll think we're just trying to keep them on their toes.That will tell us something, at least. ""There will be riots if I'm right. ""There will be worse than that. "Kanya turns for the door, feeling sick."When your tests are done and your data is ready for him to examine, I'll meet your devil. "She makes a face of distaste."You'll have your confirmations. ""Kanya?"She turns."I'm truly sorry about Jaidee," Ratana says."I know you were close. "Kanya grimaces."He was a tiger. "She pulls open the door, leaving Ratana to her demon's lair.An entire facility dedicated to the Kingdom's survival, kilowatts of power burning all day and all night, and none of it of any real use.25  Anderson sama appears without warning, sitting down on a bar stool beside her, ordering water with ice for her and a whiskey for himself.He doesn't smile at her, hardly acknowledges her at all but still Emiko feels a rush of gratitude.For the last several days she has hidden in the bar, waiting for the moment when the white shirts will decide to mulch her.She exists on sufferance and astronomical bribes and now she knows as Raleigh looks at her that it is unlikely he will let her go.He has too much invested in her now to allow her departure.And then Anderson sama appears, and for a moment, she feels safe, feels as though she is back in the arms of Gendo sama.She knows it is her training that does this and yet she cannot help it.She smiles when she sees him sitting beside her, under the phosphorescent light of glow worms, his gaijin features so strange amongst the sea of Thais and the few Japanese men who know of her existence.As is proper, he does not acknowledge her existence, but he stands and goes over to Raleigh and she knows that as soon as her performance is done, that she will sleep safe tonight.For once since the crackdown, she will not live in fear of the white shirts.She is surprised when Raleigh comes over immediately."Looks like you're doing something right.The farang wants to fine you out early. ""No show tonight?"Raleigh shrugs."He paid. "Emiko feels a rush of relief.She hurries to ready herself and then she's slipping down the stairs.Raleigh has arranged that the white shirts will only come and raid at specific times, and so she has assurance that within the confines of Ploenchit she can do as she likes.Nevertheless she is cautious.There were three raids early on, before the new patterns were settled.A number of owners spat blood before a new detente was agreed upon.Not Raleigh though.Raleigh seems to have a supernatural understanding of the workings of enforcement and bureaucracy.Outside Ploenchit, Anderson is waiting in his rickshaw, smelling of whiskey and tobacco, his face rough with evening stubble.She leans against him."I hoped you would come. ""I'm sorry it took so long.Things are a bit unsettled for me. ""I missed you. "She is surprised to find that it is true.They ease through the night traffic, past shambling shadow megodonts and cheshire flickers, past burning candles and sleeping families.They pass white shirt uniforms patrolling, but the officers are busy checking a vegetable stall.The green illumination of the gas lights flickers over them."Are you all right?"He nods at the white shirts."Is the Ministry raiding?""It was bad at first.But now it is better. "There was panic during the first raids, as the white shirts stormed up the stairwells rousting mama sans, shutting off pirate methane taps, swinging their batons.Ladyboys screaming, owners rushing to find more cash and then falling under the clubs when they failed to bribe their way free.Emiko had huddled amongst the other girls, still as a statue as the white shirts stalked the bar, pointing out problems, threatening to beat them all until they couldn't earn.Not a trace of good humor in them, only anger at the loss of their Tiger, only an urge to teach lessons to everyone who had ever laughed at white shirt rules.Terror.Nearly pissing herself as she held still amongst the girls, sure that Kannika would shove her out and reveal her, that she would choose this moment to effect Emiko's demise.Raleigh, performing careful obeisances to all of them, a farce for some of the regular takers of his bribes, some of them even looking directly at her Suttipong and Addilek and Thanachai all of them fully aware of her and her role in the place, having gone so far as to sample her even, and all of them staring at her, trying to decide if they would "discover" her.Everyone playing their roles, and Emiko waiting for Kannika to break the charade, to force everyone to look at the windup girl that had been so lucrative a source for bribes.Emiko shivers at the memory."It is better now," she says again.Anderson sama nods.Their rickshaw stops in front of his building.He climbs down first, checks to ensure that no white shirts are about, then ushers her inside.The paired security guards scrupulously ignore her existence.When she leaves, she will tip them to make sure that they forget entirely.She may disgust them, but they will play along if she is respectful, and if she pays.With the white shirts on edge, she will have to pay more.But it can be done.She and Anderson sama enter the elevator, and the elevator woman calls out the estimated weight, her face carefully expressionless.Safely inside his flat, they come together.Emiko is surprised at how happy she is that he delights in her, that he runs his hands over her skin, that he wishes to touch her.She has forgotten what it is to look almost human, to be nearly respected.In Japan, there was no such compunction about looking upon her.But here she feels as if she is an animal every day.It is a relief to be loved, even if it is only for her physicality.His hands run over her breasts, down across her stomach, slip between her legs, burrow deeper.She is relieved that it is easy, that he will know her pleasure.Emiko presses herself to him, and their mouths find one another, and for a time she forgets entirely that people call her windup and heechy keechy.For a moment she feels entirely human, and she loses herself in the touching.In Anderson sama's skin.In the security of pleasure and duty.But after their union, her depression returns.Anderson sama brings her cool water, solicitous of her exertion.He lies down beside her, naked, careful not to touch, not to add to the heat she has built up."What's the matter?"he asks.Emiko shrugs, tries to make herself into a smiling New Person."It is nothing.Nothing that can be changed. "It's almost impossible to speak her needs.It goes against all her nature.Mizumi sensei would strike her for it.Anderson sama watches her, his eyes surprisingly tender for a man with scars that crisscross his body.She can catalogue those scars.Each one a mystery of violence on his pale skin.Perhaps the puckered scars on his chest came from spring gun attacks.Perhaps the one on his shoulder came from a machete.The ones on his back look like whip marks, almost certainly.The only one she's certain about is the neck scar, from his factory.He reaches out to touch her gently."What's wrong?"Emiko rolls away from him.She can barely speak through her embarrassment."The white shirts they will never let me out of the city.And now Raleigh san has paid more bribes to keep me.He will never let me go, I think. "Anderson sama doesn't respond.She can hear his breathing, slow and steady, but nothing else.Her shame is all encompassing.Stupid greedy windup girl.You should be grateful for what he is willing to provide.The silence stretches.Finally, Anderson sama asks, "You're sure Raleigh can't be convinced?He's a businessman. "Emiko listens to the sound of his breathing.Is he offering to buy her free?If he were Japanese, it would be an offer, carefully couched.But with Anderson sama, it is hard to tell."I do not know.Raleigh san likes money.But I think also that he likes to see me suffer. "She waits, straining for a clue as to what he is thinking.Anderson sama doesn't ask for more information.Leaves her hint dangling.She can feel his body though, close to her, the heat of his skin.Is he listening still?If he were civilized, she would take this lack of response as a definitive slap.But gaijin are not subtle.Emiko steels herself.Presses again, almost gagging with humiliation as she overcomes her training and genetic imperatives.Fighting to keep herself from cowering like a dog, she tries again."I am living in the bar, now.Raleigh san pays the bribes to keep the white shirts away, triple bribes now, some to the other bars, and some to the white shirts, to allow me to be there.I do not know how much longer I can last.My niche is vanishing, I think. ""Do you" Anderson sama breaks off, hesitating.Then says, "You could stay here. "Emiko's heart skips."Raleigh san would follow, I think. ""There are ways to handle people like Raleigh. ""You can free me from him?""I doubt I have the funds to buy you out. "Emiko's heart crashes as Anderson sama continues, "With tension so high, I can't provoke him by just taking you away.Not when he could just send the white shirts hunting here.It would be too risky.But I think I can arrange for you to sleep here at least.Raleigh might even appreciate the lessened exposure. ""But would this not create problems for you?The white shirts do not like farang, either.You are very precarious now. "Help me fly from this place.Help me find the New People villages.Help me, please."If I were to pay Raleigh san's fines I could go north. "Anderson sama tugs her shoulder gently.Emiko lets herself be pulled back to him."You hope for too little," he says.His hand traces across her stomach.Idle.Thoughtful."A lot of things may be changing soon.Maybe even for windups. "He favors her with a small secretive smile."The white shirts and their rules won't be here forever. "She is begging for survival, and he speaks of fantasy.Emiko tries to keep her disappointment hidden.You should be content, greedy girl.Grateful for what you have.But she can't keep the bitterness from her voice."I am a windup.Nothing will change.We will always be despised. "He laughs at that, pulls her close."Don't be so sure. "His lips brush her ear, whispering.Conspiratorial."If you pray to that bakeneko cheshire god of yours, I might be able to give you something better than a village in the jungle.With a little luck, you might end up with a whole city. "Emiko pushes away, looks at him sadly."I understand if you cannot change my lot.But you should not tease me. "Anderson sama only laughs again.26  Hock Seng crouches in an alley just outside the farang manufacturing district.It's night, but still there are white shirts everywhere.Everywhere he goes, he finds cordons of uniforms.On the quays, clipper ships sit isolated, waiting for permission to unload cargo.In the factory district, Ministry officers stand on every corner, preventing access for workers and owners and shopkeepers alike.Only a few people are allowed in and out, ones who show residence cards.Locals.With only a yellow card for identification, it took Hock Seng half the evening to traverse the city, avoiding checkpoints.He misses Mai.Those young eyes and ears made him feel safe.Now he crouches with cheshires and the stink of urine, watching white shirts check another man's identification and cursing that he is cut off from the SpringLife factory.He should have been brave.Should have simply robbed the safe when he had the chance.Should have risked everything.And now it's too late.Now the white shirts own every inch of the city, and their favorite target is yellow cards.They like to test their batons on yellow card skulls, like to teach them lessons.If the Dung Lord didn't have so much influence, Hock Seng is sure that the ones in the towers would already be slaughtered.The Environment Ministry sees yellow cards the same way it sees the other invasive species and plagues it manages.Given a choice, the white shirts would slaughter every yellow card Chinese and then make a khrab of apology for their over enthusiasm to the Child Queen.But only after the fact.A young woman shows her pass and clears the cordon.She disappears down the street, deeper into the manufacturing district.Everything is so tantalizingly close, and yet so impossibly out of reach.Looked at objectively, it is probably best that the factory is closed.Safer for everyone.If he weren't so dependent on the contents of the safe, he would just report the line's infections and be done with the tamade thing entirely.And yet, in the midst of all that illness, ensconced above the miasma of the algae baths, the blueprints and specifications still beckon.Hock Seng wants to tear out the last of his hair with frustration.He glares at the checkpoint, willing the white shirts to go away, to look somewhere else.Wishing, praying to the goddess Kuan Yin, begging to fat gold Budai for a little luck.With those manufacturing plans and the support of the Dung Lord, so much would be possible.So much future.So much life.Offerings for his ancestors again.Perhaps a wife.Perhaps a son to carry on his name.Perhaps  A patrol stalks past.Hock Seng eases deeper into shadow.The enforcers remind him of when the Green Headbands began patrolling at night.They started out looking for couples holding hands in the evening, displaying immorality.At the time, he told his children to watch themselves, to understand that the tides of conservatism came and went and if they could not live as freely and openly as their parents had, well then, what of it?Didn't they have food in their bellies and family and friends whose company they enjoyed?And within their high walled compounds, it was irrelevant what the Green Headbands thought.Another patrol.Hock Seng turns and slips back down the alley.There is no way to sneak into the manufacturing district.The white shirts are determined to shut down Trade and hurt the farang.He grimaces and begins the long circuitous route back through the sois toward his hovel.Others in the Ministry were corrupt, but not Jaidee.Not if anyone is honest about the man.Even Sawatdee Krung Thep!, the whisper sheet which loved him most, and then denigrated him so completely during his disgrace, has printed pages and pages in praise of the hero of the country.Captain Jaidee was too well loved to be cut into pieces, to be treated like offal that is dumped in methane composters.Someone must be punished.And if Trade is to blame, then trade must be punished.So the factories are closed along with anchor pads and roads and docks, and Hock Seng cannot squeeze out.He cannot book passage on a clipper, cannot ride upriver to the ruined Ayutthaya, cannot flee on a dirigible to Kolkata or Japan.He makes his way past the docks and, sure enough, the white shirts are still there, along with small knots of workers, squatting on the ground, idled by the blockade.A beautiful clipper ship lies anchored a hundred meters offshore, rocking gently in the water.As beautiful a clipper as he ever owned.Latest generation, switch hulls and hydrofoils, palm oil polymer, wind wings.Fast.Capable of hauling plenty of cargo.It sits out there, gleaming.And he stands on the dock, staring at it.It might as well be docked in India.He spies a food cart, a vendor frying generipped tilapia in a deep wok.Hock Seng steels himself.He has to ask, even if he reveals himself as a yellow card.He is blind without information.With the white shirts at the other end of the dock, if the man calls out, he should still have time to flee.Hock Seng eases close."Is there any way of passengers crossing?"he murmurs.He tilts his head toward the clipper."Over there?""No transit for anyone," the vendor mutters."Not even a single man?"The man scowls, nods at the others in the shadows, squatting and smoking cigarettes, playing at cards.Huddled around the hand crank radio of a shop keeper."Those ones have been there for the last week.You'll have to wait, yellow card.Just like everyone else. "Hock Seng fights the urge to flinch at being identified.Forces himself to pretend as if they are all equals in this, to create a hopeful fiction that the man will see him as a person, and not as some unwelcome cheshire."You haven't heard of small boats, further down the coast?Away from the city?For money?"The fish vendor shakes his head."No one's going either way.They've caught two different groups of passengers trying to make their way ashore from the ships, too.The white shirts won't even allow a resupply boat to go out.We're betting on whether the captain will weigh anchor or the white shirts will open up first. ""What are the odds?"Hock Seng asks."I'll give you eleven to one that the clipper leaves first. "Hock Seng makes a face."I don't think I'll risk it. ""Twenty to one, then. "A few others seem to have been listening to the exchange.They laugh quietly."Don't bet unless he gives you fifty to one," one of them says."The white shirts aren't going to bend.Not this time.Not with the Tiger dead. "Hock Seng makes himself laugh with them.He pulls out a cigarette and lights it, offers more to the people around him.A small gift of good will for these Thais, for this moment of shared brotherhood.If he were not a yellow card with a yellow card accent, he might even try a gift of goodwill for the white shirts, but on a night like tonight it will earn him nothing but a baton on the skull.He has no interest in seeing his head splintered against paving stones.He smokes and studies the blockade.Time is passing.The idea of a sealed city makes his hands shake.This isn't about yellow cards, he tells himself.We are not the reason for this.But he has a hard time believing a noose isn't tightening.It might be about Trade right now, but there are too many yellow cards in the city and if trade is cut off for long, even these friendly people will begin to notice the lack of work, and then they will drink, and then they will think of the yellow cards in the towers.The Tiger is dead.His face is on every gaslight pole.Pasted to every building.Three images of Jaidee in a fighting pose stare out from a warehouse wall even now.Hock Seng smokes his cigarette and scowls at that face.The hero of the people.The man who could not be bought, who faced down ministers and farang companies and petty businessmen.The man who was willing to fight even his own ministry.Sent to a desk job when he became too troublesome, and then put back on the street when he became even more so.The man who laughed at death threats, and survived three assassinations before the fourth felled him.Hock Seng grimaces.The number four is everywhere in his mind these days.The Tiger of Bangkok only got four chances.How many has he himself used up?Hock Seng studies the docks and the clustered people, all unable to make their ships.With the sharpened senses of a refugee, he smells hazard in the wind, sharper than the sea air that sweeps across a clipper and presages typhoon.The Tiger is dead.Captain Jaidee's painted eyes stare out at Hock Seng, and Hock Seng has the sudden, horrified feeling that the Tiger is not dead.That in fact, he is hunting.Hock Seng shies away from the poster as if it is a blister rusted durian.He knows in his bones, knows as surely as his clan is all dead and buried in Malaya, that it's time to run.Time to hide from tigers that hunt though the night.Time to plunge into leech infested jungles and eat cockroaches and slither through the mud of the rainy season as it gushes in torrents.It doesn't matter where he goes.All that matters is that it's time to flee.Hock Seng stares out at the anchored clipper ship.Time to make hard decisions.Time, in truth, to give up on the SpringLife factory and its blueprints.Delays will only make it worse.Money must be spent.Survival secured.This raft is sinking.27  Carlyle is already waiting anxiously in the rickshaw when Anderson comes out of his building.The man's eyes flick from right to left, cataloguing the darkness around him in a nervous rotation.The man has the trembling cautiousness of a rabbit."You look jumpy," Anderson notes as he climbs in.Carlyle grimaces."The white shirts just took the Victory.Confiscated everything. "Anderson glances up at his own apartment, glad that poor old Yates chose to locate far from the rest of the farang."You lose much?""Cash in the safe.Some customer lists that I was keeping away from our offices. "Carlyle calls forward to the rickshaw driver, giving directions in Thai."You'd better have something to offer these people. ""Akkarat knows what I'm offering. "They begin rolling through the humid night.Cheshires scatter.Carlyle glances behind them, scanning for followers."No one's officially going after farang, but you know we're next on the list.I'm not sure how much longer we'll be able to keep a toehold in the country. ""Look on the bright side.If they go after farang, Akkarat won't be far behind. "They spin across the darkened city.Ahead of them, a checkpoint materializes.Carlyle mops his forehead.He's sweating like a pig.The white shirts hail their rickshaw and they slow.Anderson feels a prickle of tension."You're sure this will work?"Carlyle wipes his brow again."We'll know soon enough. "The rickshaw coasts to a stop and the white shirts surround them.Carlyle speaks rapidly.Hands across a piece of paper.The white shirts confer for a moment, and then they're giving obsequious wais and motioning the farang forward."I'll be damned. "Carlyle laughs, relief obvious in his voice."The right stamps on a piece of paper do wonders. ""I'm amazed that Akkarat still has any influence. "Carlyle shakes his head."Akkarat couldn't do this. "The buildings turn to slums as they near the seawall.The rickshaw swerves around pieces of concrete that have fallen from the heights of an old Expansion hotel.Anderson supposes that it must have been lovely in the past.The terraced levels rise above them, silhouetted in moonlight.But now slum shacks lap all around it, and the last bits of its plate glass windows glimmer like teeth.The rickshaw slows to a halt at the foot of the seawall's embankment.Paired guardian naga flank the stairs to the top of the seawall.They watch as Carlyle pays the rickshaw man."Come on. "Carlyle leads Anderson up the steps, his hand trailing along the scales of the naga.From the top of the levee, they have a clear view of the city.The Grand Palace shines in the distance.High walls obscure the inner courts that house the Child Queen and her entourage, but its gold spiked chedi rise above, gleaming softly in the moonlight.Carlyle tugs Anderson's sleeve."Don't dawdle. "Anderson hesitates, searching the darkness of the shoreline below."Where are the white shirts?They should be all over this place. ""Don't worry.They don't have authority here. "He laughs at some secret joke and ducks under the saisin that strings along the levee's top."Come on. "He scrambles down the rubbled embankment, picking his way toward the lap of the waves.Anderson hesitates, still scanning the open area, then follows.As they reach the shoreline, a kink spring skiff materializes out of the darkness, hurtling toward them.Anderson almost bolts, thinking it's a white shirt patrol, but Carlyle whispers, "It's ours. "They wade out into the shallows and clamber aboard.The boat pivots sharply and they cut away from shore.Moonlight glints on the waves, a blanket of silver.The only sounds in the boat come from the slap of waves on the hull and the tick of kink springs unwinding.Ahead of them, a barge looms, dark except for a few LED running lights.Their skiff bumps up against the side.A moment later, a rope ladder lofts over the side, and they clamber up into the darkness.Crewmen wai respectfully as they come aboard.Carlyle makes a motion for Anderson to keep quiet as they are led below decks.At the end of corridor, guards flank a door.They call through, announcing the arriving farang, and the door opens, revealing a group of men at a large dining table, all laughing and drinking.One of the men is Akkarat.Another Anderson recognizes as an admiral who harries the calorie ships going to Koh Angrit.Another he thinks is perhaps a southern general.In one corner, a sleek man wearing a black military uniform stands watching, eyes attentive.Another  Anderson sucks in his breath.Carlyle whispers, "Get down and show some respect. "He's already falling to his knees and making a khrab.Anderson drops as quickly as he can.The Somdet Chaopraya watches expressionless as they pay obeisance.Akkarat laughs at their bowing and scraping.He comes around the table and brings them to their feet."No need for so much formality here," he says, smiling."Come.Join us.We're all friends here. ""Indeed. "The Somdet Chaopraya smiles and raises a glass."Come and drink. "Anderson wais again, as deeply as he is able.Hock Seng claims that the Somdet Chaopraya has killed more people than the Environment Ministry has slaughtered chickens.Before he was appointed protector of the Child Queen, he was a general, and his campaigns in the east are the brutal stuff of legend.If it weren't for the accident of his common birth line, it is speculated that he might even think to supplant royalty.Instead, he looms behind the throne, and all khrab before him.Anderson's heart is pounding.With the Somdet Chaopraya backing a change of government, anything is possible.After years of searching and the failure in Finland, a seedbank is close.And with it, the answer to nightshades and ngaw and a thousand other genetic puzzles.This hard eyed man who toasts him with a smile that could be friendly or feral holds the keys to everything.A servant offers wine to Anderson and Carlyle.They join the assembled men at the table."We were just talking about the coal war," Akkarat supplies."The Vietnamese have given up on Phnom Penh for the moment. ""Good news, then. "The conversation continues, but Anderson only half listens.Instead, he furtively observes the Somdet Chaopraya.The last time he saw the man was outside the Environment Ministry's temple to Phra Seub, as they both gawked at the Japanese delegation's windup girl.In person, the man appears much older than in the pictures that adorn the city and depict him as a loyal defender of the Child Queen.His face is mottled with drink, and his eyes are sunken with the debauch he is rumored to like so well.Hock Seng claims that his brutal reputation on the battlefield is matched in his private life, and though the Thais may khrab before his image, he is not loved as the Child Queen is.And now, as the Somdet Chaopraya looks up and catches Anderson's gaze, Anderson thinks he sees why.He's met calorie executives like this.Men intoxicated on their power and influence, their ability to bring nations to heel with the threat of a SoyPRO embargo.A hard, brutal man.Anderson wonders if the Child Queen will actually reach the fullness of her power with this man standing so close.It seems unlikely.Conversation around the table continues to carefully avoid the reason for their midnight rendezvous.They speak of harvests in the north, and discuss the problem of the Mekong now that the Chinese have placed more dams at its source.They talk about new clipper ship designs that Mishimoto is preparing for production."Forty knots with favorable winds!"Carlyle pounds the table gleefully."A hydrofoil package and fifteen hundred tons of cargo.I'm going to buy a fleet of them!"Akkarat laughs."I thought air freight was the future.Heavy lift dirigibles. ""With those clippers?I'm willing to hedge my bets.During the old Expansion there was a mix of transit options.Air and sea.I don't see why it won't be the same this time. ""The new Expansion is on everyone's minds these days. "Akkarat's smile fades.He glances at the Somdet Chaopraya, who gives a barely discernable nod.The Trade Minister goes on, speaking directly to Anderson."Some elements in the Kingdom oppose this progress.Benighted elements, to be sure, but inconveniently tenacious as well. ""If you're asking for assistance," Anderson says, "we remain happy to provide it. "Another pause.Akkarat's eyes stray again to the Somdet Chaopraya.He clears his throat."There are concerns, still, about the nature of your assistance.The history of your sort doesn't invite confidence. ""A bit like climbing into bed with a nest of scorpions," the Somdet Chaopraya supplies.Anderson smiles slightly."It seems you are already surrounded by a number of nests.With your permission, some of them could be removed.To mutual benefit. ""The price you're asking is too high," Akkarat says.Anderson keeps his voice neutral."We are asking for nothing other than access. ""And this man, this Gibbons. ""You know of him, then?"Anderson leans forward."You know where he is?"The table falls silent.Akkarat glances again at the Somdet Chaopraya.The man shrugs, but it's enough of an answer for Anderson.Gibbons is here.Somewhere in the country.Probably in the city.No doubt designing a follow up triumph to the ngaw."We're not asking for the country," Anderson says."The Thai Kingdom is nothing like Burma or India.It has its own history, one of independence.We respect that absolutely. "The assembled men's faces turn stony.Anderson curses himself.Fool.You're speaking to their terrors.He changes tacks."There are significant opportunities here.Cooperation benefits both parties.My people are prepared to offer significant assistance to the Kingdom if we can come to agreement.Help with your border disputes, calorie security that hasn't been enjoyed since the Expansion, all of this can be yours.This is an opportunity for all of us. "Anderson trails off.The general is nodding.The admiral is frowning.Akkarat and the Somdet Chaopraya are blanks.He can't read them at all."Please excuse us," Akkarat says.It is not a request.The guards indicate that Anderson and Carlyle should leave.A moment later they are out in the passageway with four guards surrounding them.Carlyle stares at the floor."They don't seem convinced.Can you think of any reason why they wouldn't trust you?""I've got weapons and the money for bribes ready to be landed.If they can open communication with Pracha's generals, I can buy and equip them.Where is the risk for them?"Anderson shakes his head, irritated."They should be jumping at the opportunity.It's the most equitable deal we've ever offered. ""It's not the offer.It's you.You, and AgriGen, and every bit of your damn history.If they trust you, it happens.If not" Carlyle shrugs.The door opens and they're invited back in.Akkarat says, "Thank you so much for your time.I'm sure that we will take your offer under advisement. "Carlyle slumps, deflated by the polite refusal.The Somdet Chaopraya smiles slightly as the news is delivered.Pleased, perhaps, to slap the farang down.More polite words are passed around the cabin, but Anderson hardly hears them.Rejection.He's so close he can almost taste the ngaw, and still they throw up barriers.There has to be a way to reopen discussion.He stares at the Somdet Chaopraya.He needs a lever.Something to break this impasse   Anderson almost laughs out loud.Pieces click into place.Carlyle is still mumbling disappointment, but Anderson just smiles and wais, hunting for a way in.A way to keep the conversation going a bit longer."I completely understand your concerns.We have not earned sufficient trust.Perhaps we could discuss something different.A project of friendship, say.Something less high stakes. "The admiral grimaces."We want nothing from your hand. ""Please, don't be hasty.We offer in good faith.And regarding that other project, if you change your mind about our assistance, whether it happens in a week, or a year, or ten years, you will always find us supportive. ""A very fine speech. "Akkarat says.He's smiling, even as he shoots the admiral a sharp look."I'm sure there are no hard feelings, here.Please, at least have one last drink.We've troubled you to come so far, there's no reason we shouldn't part as friends. "Still in the game then.Anderson feels a rush of relief."Our sentiments exactly. "Soon the drink is flowing, and Carlyle is promising that he would happily ship an order of saffron from India as soon as the current embargo is lifted, and Akkarat is telling a story about a white shirt trying to take three bribes from three different food stalls who keeps losing his count, and all the while, Anderson watches the Somdet Chaopraya, waiting for an opening.When the man goes to a window to look out at the water, Anderson moves to join him."It's a pity that your proposal wasn't accepted," the man says.Anderson shrugs."I'm happy to be walking out alive.A few years ago, I would have been trampled by megodonts for simply trying to meet with you. "The Somdet Chaopraya laughs."You're confident we'll let you walk out?""Confident enough, anyway.It's not a bad gamble," Anderson says."You and Akkarat are honorable, even if we don't agree on every particular.I don't consider it a particularly risky bet. ""No?Half the people in this room suggested that feeding you to the river carp tonight was the wisest course. "He pauses, hard sunken eyes staring at Anderson."It was a very close thing. "Anderson makes himself smile."I gather you weren't in agreement with your admiral?""Not tonight. "Anderson wais."Then I'm grateful. ""Don't thank me yet.I may yet decide to have you killed.Your kind have a very poor reputation. ""Would you at least give me a chance to bargain for my life?"Anderson asks wryly.The Somdet Chaopraya shrugs."It wouldn't do you any good.Your life is the most interesting thing I could take. ""Then I would have to offer something unique. "The man's hollow eyes flick back to Anderson."Impossible. ""Not at all," Anderson says."I can give you something you've never seen before.Could do it tonight even.Something exquisite.It's not for the squeamish, but it is astonishing and unique.Would that keep you from feeding to the river carp?"The Somdet Chaopraya gives him a look of annoyance."There is nothing you can show me that I have not already seen. ""Would you care to wager?""Still gambling, farang?"The Somdet Chaopraya laughs."Haven't you risked enough for one night?""Not at all.I'm just trying to make sure my limbs stay attached.It hardly seems like a risk, given how much I might lose otherwise. "He meets the Somdet Chaopraya's eye."But I am willing to bet.Are you?"The Somdet Chaopraya gives him a hard look, calls to his men."Our calorie man is a gambler!He says he can show me something I haven't seen before.What do you all think of that?"His men all laugh."The odds are very much against you," the Somdet Chaopraya observes."Still, I think the bet is a good one.And I'm willing to place good money on it. ""Money?"The Somdet Chaopraya makes a face."I thought we were talking about your life. ""What about the plans for my kink spring factory, then?""I could simply take that, if I wanted. "The Somdet Chaopraya snaps his fingers, irritated."Just like that, and they're mine. ""All right. "Anderson grimaces.All or nothing."What if I offered you and your Kingdom my company's next iteration of U Tex rice?Would that be a worthwhile bet?And not just the rice, but the grain before it is rendered sterile.Your people can plant it and replant it for as long as it's viable against blister rust.My life can't be worth more than that. "The room falls quiet.The Somdet Chaopraya studies him."And to balance that risk?What is it you want if you win?""I want to go forward with the political project we discussed earlier.Under the same terms as we already proposed.Terms which we both know are entirely favorable to you and your Kingdom. "The Somdet Chaopraya's eyes narrow."You're a tenacious one, aren't you?And what's to keep you from simply withholding the U Tex you're offering, if you lose?"Anderson smiles and waves a hand toward Carlyle."I assume that you would have myself and Mr.Carlyle here torn apart by megodonts if we fail to make good.Would that be satisfactory?"Carlyle laughs, his voice tinged with hysteria."What kind of bet is that?"Anderson doesn't take eyes away from the Somdet Chaopraya."The only one that matters.I trust absolutely that his Excellency will be honest if I manage to surprise him.And we will place ourselves in his hands as a token of that trust.It's a perfectly reasonable bet.We're both honorable men. "The Somdet Chaopraya smiles."I accept your bet. "He laughs and claps Anderson on the back."Surprise me farang.And good luck to you.To see you trampled would be a pleasure. "* * *   They make a strange party as they move across the city.The Somdet Chaopraya's retinue guarantees them access through checkpoints, and the surprised shouts of white shirts echo in the darkness as they realize who they are trying to halt.Carlyle wipes his forehead with a handkerchief."Christ, you're a crazy bastard.I should have never agreed to introduce you. "Now that the bet is made and the risk defined, Anderson is inclined to agree.The U Tex rice offering is a real risk.Even if his handlers back the play, the finance people will fight.One lost calorie man is infinitely more replaceable than primary seedstock.If the Thais start exporting the rice, it will undercut profits for years."It's fine," he mutters."Trust me. ""Trust you?"Carlyle's hands are shaking."Trust you to put me under a megodont?"He glances around."I should just run for it. ""Don't bother.The Somdet Chaopraya gave his guards instructions.If we have second thoughts now" He jerks his head back toward the men riding in the rickshaw behind."They'll kill you as soon as you try to run. "A few minutes later, familiar towers rise into view."Ploenchit?"Carlyle asks."Jesus and Noah, you're seriously taking the Somdet Chaopraya here?""Calm down.You're the one who gave me the idea. "Anderson gets down from his rickshaw.The Somdet Chaopraya and his retinue all mill before the entrance.The Somdet Chaopraya gives him a pitying look."This is the best you can do?Girls?Sex?"He shakes his head."Don't be too quick to judge. "Anderson indicates that they should come inside."Please.I'm sorry that we'll have to climb the stairs.The accommodations do not befit your rank, but I assure you that the experience is worth it. "The Somdet Chaopraya shrugs and lets Anderson lead.His guards crowd close, nervous in the dark confines.The junkies and whores in the stairwells all catch sight of the Somdet Chaopraya and collapse into panicked khrabs.Word of their arrival rushes up the stairwells.The Chaopraya's guards run ahead, searching the darkness.The doors of Soil open.Girls drop to their knees.The Somdet Chaopraya looks around himself with distaste."This is a place you farang frequent?""As I said, not the finest.I am very sorry for that. "Anderson beckons him."It's this way. "He strides across the room and pulls aside the curtain, revealing the inner theater.Emiko lies on stage with Kannika kneeling over her.Men crowd around as Kannika draws out the telltale movements of the windup girl's design.Her body twitches and jerks in the light of glow worms.The Somdet Chaopraya stops short and stares."I thought only the Japanese had them," he murmurs.28  "We found another. "Kanya starts.It's Pai, standing at her doorway.Kanya rubs her face.She was sitting at her desk, trying to write another report, waiting for word from Ratana.And now drool soaks the back of her hand and her pen leaks everywhere.Asleep.And dreaming of Jaidee who simply sits and pokes fun at all her justifications."Were you sleeping?"Pai asks.Kanya rubs her face."What time is it?""Second hour in the morning.The sun's been up for a while. "Pai waits patiently for her to gather her wits, a pockmarked man who should be her senior, but who Kanya has overtaken.He is of the old guard.One who worshipped Jaidee and his ways, and whom remembers the Environment Ministry when it was not ridiculed, but feted.A good man.A man whose bribes are all known to Kanya.Pai may be corrupt, but she knows who owns which parts, and so she trusts him."We found another," he repeats.Kanya straightens."Who else knows?"Pai shakes his head."You took it to Ratana?"He nods."It wasn't tagged as a suspicious death.It took some effort to find.This is like looking for a silver minnow in the rice paddies. ""Not even tagged?"Kanya sucks in her breath, lets it out in an irritated hiss."They're all incompetent.No one remembers how it always comes.They forget so quickly. "Pai nods easily, listening to his mistress rant.The pits and holes of his face stare back at her.Another worming disease.Kanya can't remember if it was a genehack weevil that did it, or a variation on phii bacteria.All Pai says is, "This makes two, then?""Three. "Kanya pauses."A name?Did the man have a name?"Pai shakes his head."They were careful. "Kanya nods sourly."I want you to go around to the districts and see if anyone has reported any missing relatives.Three people missing.Get photos taken. "Pai shrugs."You have a better idea?""Perhaps forensics will find something to link them," he suggests."Yes, fine.Do that as well.Where is Ratana?""She has sent the body to the pits.She asks for you to meet her. "Kanya grimaces."Of course. "She tidies her papers and leaves Pai to his futile searches.As she leaves the administrative building, she wonders what Jaidee would do in this situation.For him, inspiration came easily.Jaidee would stop in the middle of the road, struck suddenly by enlightenment, and then they would be off, running through the city, hunting for the source of contamination, and invariably, the man would be right.It sickens Kanya to think that the Kingdom must rely on her instead.I am bought, she thinks.I am paid for.I am bought.When she first arrived at the Environment Ministry as Akkarat's mole, it was a surprise to discover that the little privileges of the Environment Ministry were always enough.The weekly take from street stalls to burn something other than expensive approved source methane.The pleasure of a night patrol spent sleeping well.It was an easy existence.Even under Jaidee, it was easy.And now by ill luck she must work, and the work is important, and she has had two masters for so long that she cannot remember which one should be ascendant.Someone else should have replaced you, Jaidee.Someone worthy.The Kingdom falls because we are not strong.We are not virtuous, we do not follow the eightfold path and now the sicknesses come again.And she is the one who must stand against them, like Phra Seub but without the strength or moral compass.Kanya strides across the quads, nodding at other officers, scowling.Jaidee, what is it in your kamma that placed me second to you?That placed your life's work in my fickle hands?What joker did this?Was this Phii Oun, the cheshire trickster spirit, happy to see more carrion and offal in the world?Happy to see our corpses piled high?Ahead, men wearing filter masks jump to attention as they spy her pushing open the gates to the crematory grounds.She has a mask issued, but leaves it dangling around her neck.It does no good for an officer to show fear, and she knows the mask will not save her.She places more faith in a Phra Seub amulet.The open dirt expanse of the pits lays before her, massive holes cut into the red earth, lined to keep out the seep of the water table that lies close below.Wet land, and yet the surface bakes in the heat.The dry season never ends.Will the monsoon even come this year?Will it save them or drown them?There are gamblers who bet on nothing else, changing the odds on the monsoon daily.But with the climate so much altered, even the Environment Ministry's own modelling computers are unsure of the monsoon from year to year.Ratana stands at the edge of a pit.Oily smoke roils up from the burning bodies below.Overhead a few ravens and vultures circle.A dog has gotten into the compound and skulks along the walls, looking for scraps."How did that get in?"Kanya asks.Ratana looks up and spies the dog."Nature finds a way," she observes dully."If we leave food, it will reach for it. ""You found another body?""Same symptoms. "Ratana's body is slumped, her shoulders bowed inward.Below them, the fires crackle.A vulture sweeps low.A uniformed officer fires a cannon and the explosion sends the vulture screeching skyward again.It circles.Ratana closes her eyes briefly.Tears threaten at the corners of her eyes.She shakes her head, seeming to steel herself.Kanya watches sadly, wondering if either of them will be alive at the end of this newest plague."We should warn everyone," Ratana says."Inform General Pracha.The palace as well. ""You're sure now?"Ratana sighs."It was in a different hospital.Across the city.A street clinic.They assumed it was yaba stick overdose.Pai found them by accident.A casual conversation on his way to Bangkok Mercy to look for evidence. ""By accident. "Kanya shakes her head."He didn't tell me that.How many could there be out there?Hundreds already?Thousands?""I don't know.The only good thing is that we haven't seen any sign that they themselves are contagious. ""Yet. ""You must go ask Gi Bu Sen for advice.He is the only one who knows what sort of monster we face.These are his children, coming to torment us.He will recognize them.I'm having the new samples prepared.Between the three, he will know.  ""There's no other way?""Our only other choice is to begin quarantining the city, and then the riots will begin and there will be nothing left to save. "* * *   Rice paddies sprawl in all directions, emerald green, bright and neon in the tropic sun.Kanya has been inside the sinkhole ofKrung Thep for so long that it's a relief to see this growing world.It makes her imagine that there is hope.That the rice grasses will not wilt red under some new variant of blister rust.That some engineered spore will not float over from Burma and take root.Flooded fields still grow, the dikes still hold, and His Royal Majesty King Rama XII's pumps still move water.Tattooed farmers make wais of respect as Kanya cycles past.By the stamps on their arms, most of them have already done corve labor for the year.A few others are marked for the start of the rainy season when they will be required to come to the city and shore up its dikes for the deluge.Kanya has her own tattoos from her time in the countryside, before Akkarat's agents tasked her with this burrowing into the very heart of the Environment Ministry.After an hour of steady pedalling down raised causeways, the compound materializes.First the wires.Then the men with their dogs.Then the walls topped with glass and razor wire and high bamboo stakes.Kanya keeps to the road, avoiding trip patches.Technically, it is simply the home of a wealthy man, perched atop an artificial hill of concrete and Expansion tower rubble.Given the loss of life over the last century it is an impressive focusing of human labor for something so silly when dikes need repairs and fields need sowing and wars need fighting that a man was able to channel labor into the building of a hill.A rich man's retreat.It was originally Rama XII's, and officially it is still the property of the palace.From the vantage of a dirigible passing overhead, it is nothing.Just another compound.An extravagance for some branch of royalty.And yet, a wall is a wall, a tiger pit is a tiger pit, and men with dogs look both ways.Kanya shows the guards her papers as mastiffs growl and lunge against their chains.The beasts are larger than any natural dog.Windups.Hungry and deadly and well built for their work.They weigh twice what she does, all muscle and teeth.The horror of Gi Bu Sen's imagination, brought to life.The guards unpattern encryptions with their hand cranked code breakers.They wear the black livery of the Queen's own, and are frightening in their seriousness and efficiency.Finally they wave her past their dogs' straining teeth.Kanya cycles toward the gate, her neck prickling with the knowledge that she can never ride as fast as those dogs can run.At the gates, another set of guards reconfirm her passes before guiding her inside to a tiled terrace, and a blue jewel swimming pool.A trio of ladyboys titter and smile from where they lounge in the shade of a banana tree.Kanya smiles in return.They are pretty.And if they love a farang, then they are only foolish."I am Kip," one of them says."The doctor is having his massage. "She nods at the blue water."You can wait for him by the pool. "The scent of the ocean is strong.Kanya walks to the edge of the terrace.Below her, waves lap and curl, scrubbing white across beach sands.A breeze pours over her, clean and fresh and astonishingly optimistic after the claustrophobic stink of Bangkok behind its seawalls.She takes a deep breath, enjoying the salt and wind.A butterfly flutters past and alights on the terrace railing.Closes its jewel wings.Opens them gently.Folding itself over and over again, bright and cobalt and gold and black.Kanya studies it, stricken by its beauty, the gaudy evidence of a world beyond her own.She wonders what hungers have driven it to fly to this alien mansion with its strange farang prisoner.Of all the things of beauty, here is one that cannot be denied.Nature has worked itself into a frenzy.Kanya leans close, studying it as it clings to the rail.An unwary hand might brush it and grind it into dust without ever realizing the destruction.She reaches out with a careful finger.The butterfly startles, then allows her to gather it in, to walk it into her cupped palm.It has come a long distance.It must be tired.As tired as she feels.It has travelled continents.Crossed high steppes and emerald jungles to land here, amongst hibiscus and paving stones, so that Kanya can now hold it in her hand and appreciate its beauty.Such a long way to travel.Kanya makes a fist on its fluttering.Opens her hand and lets its dust drop to the tiles.Wing fragments and pulped body.A manufactured pollinator, wafted from some PurCal laboratory most likely.Windups have no souls.But they are beautiful.A splash comes from behind her.Kip is wearing a bathing suit now.She flickers under water, rises, pushing her long black hair back and smiling, before turning and beginning another lap.Kanya watches her swim, the graceful crawl of blue suit and brown limbs.A pretty girl.A pleasant creature to watch.Eventually, the demon wheels out to the pool edge.He is much worse than when she last saw him.Fa' gan scars mark his throat and curl to his ear.An opportunistic infection that he fought off despite the doctor's prognosis.He is in a wheelchair, pushed by an attendant.A thin blanket covers his stick legs.So his disease truly is progressing.For a long time, she thought it was only a myth, but now she can see.The man is ugly.Horrifying in his disease and his burning intensity.Kanya shivers.She'll be glad when the demon finally goes on to his next life.Becomes a corpse they can burn in quarantine.Until then, she hopes the drugs will continue to suppress his contagion.He is a crabbed hairy man with brushy eyebrows, a fat nose, and wide rubbery lips that break into a hyena grin when he sees Kanya."Ah.My jailer. ""Hardly. "Gibbons glances at Kip where she swims."Just because you give me pretty girls with pretty mouths doesn't mean I am not jailed. "He looks up."So, Kanya, I haven't seen you in a while.Where is your upright lord and master?My most favorite keeper?Where is our fighting Captain Jaidee?I don't deal with subordinates " He breaks off, studying Kanya's collar ranks.His eyes narrow."Ah.I see. "He leans back, regarding Kanya."It was just a matter of time before someone disposed of him.Congratulations on your promotion, Captain. "Kanya forces herself to remain impassive.On her previous visits it was Jaidee who always treated with the devil.They went away into interior offices, leaving Kanya to wait beside the pool with whatever creature the doctor had chosen for his pleasure.When Jaidee returned, it was always with a purse lipped silence.On one occasion, as they left the compound, Jaidee had nearly spoken, had nearly said whatever was churning in his head.He opened his mouth and said, "But " a protest that remained half formed, dead as soon as it passed his lips.Kanya had the impression that Jaidee was still carrying on a conversation, a verbal battle that pinged back and forth, like a takraw game.A war of words, flying and ricocheting, with Jaidee's skull as the playing court.On another occasion, Jaidee had simply left the compound with a scowl and the words, "He is too dangerous to keep. "Kanya had responded, confused."But he does not work for AgriGen any longer," and Jaidee had looked at her surprised, only then realizing that he had spoken aloud.The doctor was legendary.A demon to frighten children with.When Kanya first met him, she expected the man to be bound in chains, not sitting complacently and scooping out the guts of a Koh Angrit papaya, happy and grinning with juice running down his chin.Kanya was never sure if it was guilt or some other strange driving force that had sent the doctor to the Kingdom.If the lure of ladyboys and his imminent death had caused it.If a falling out with his colleagues had driven him.The doctor seemed to have no regrets.No concerns over the damage he had inflicted in the world.Spoke jokingly of foiling Ravaita and Domingo.Of wrecking ten years' labor for Doctor Michael Ping.A cheshire steals across the patio, breaking Kanya's thoughts.It leaps into the doctor's lap.Kanya steps back, disgusted, as the man scratches behind the cheshire's ears.It molts, legs and body changing hue, taking on the colors of the old man's quilt.The doctor smiles."Don't cling too tightly to what is natural, Captain.Here, look," he bends forward, makes cooing noises.The shimmer of the cheshire cranes toward his face, mewling.Its tortoiseshell fur glimmers.It licks tentatively at his chin."A hungry little beast," he says."A good thing, that.If it's hungry enough, it will succeed us entirely, unless we design a better predator.Something that hungers for it, in turn. ""We've run the analysis of that," Kanya says."The food web only unravels more completely.Another super predator won't solve the damage already done. "Gibbons snorts."The ecosystem unravelled when man first went a seafaring.When we first lit fires on the broad savannas of Africa.We have only accelerated the phenomenon.The food web you talk about is nostalgia, nothing more.Nature. "He makes a disgusted face."We are nature.Our every tinkering is nature, our every biological striving.We are what we are, and the world is ours.We are its gods.Your only difficulty is your unwillingness to unleash your potential fully upon it. ""Like AgriGen?Like U Texas?Like RedStar HiGro?"Kanya shakes her head."How many of us are dead because of their potential unleashed?Your calorie masters showed us what happens.People die. ""Everyone dies. "The doctor waves a dismissal."But you die now because you cling to the past.We should all be windups by now.It's easier to build a person impervious to blister rust than to protect an earlier version of the human creature.A generation from now, we could be well suited for our new environment.Your children could be the beneficiaries.Yet you people refuse to adapt.You cling to some idea of a humanity that evolved in concert with your environment over millennia, and which you now, perversely, refuse to remain in lockstep with."Blister rust is our environment.Cibiscosis.Genehack weevil.Cheshires.They have adapted.Quibble as you like about whether they evolved naturally or not.Our environment has changed.If we wish to remain at the top of our food chain, we will evolve.Or we will refuse, and go the way of the dinosaurs and Felis domesticus.Evolve or die.It has always been nature's guiding principle, and yet you white shirts seek to stand in the way of inevitable change. "He leans forward."I want to shake you sometimes.If you would just let me, I could be your god and shape you to the Eden that beckons us. ""I'm Buddhist. ""And we all know windups have no souls. "Gibbons grins."No rebirth for them.They will have to find their own gods to protect them.Their own gods to pray for their dead. "His grin widens."Perhaps I will be that one, and your windup children will pray to me for salvation. "His eyes twinkle."I would like a few more worshippers, I must admit.Jaidee was like you.Always such a doubter.Not as bad as Grahamites, but still, not particularly satisfactory for a god. "Kanya makes a face."When you die, we will burn you to ash and bury you in chlorine and lye and no one will remember you. "The doctor shrugs, unconcerned."All gods must suffer. "He leans back in his chair, smiling slyly."So, would you like to burn me at the stake now?Or would you like to prostrate yourself before me, and worship my intelligence once again?"Kanya hides her disgust at the man.Pulls out the bundle of papers and hands them across.The doctor takes them, but doesn't do anything else.Doesn't open them.Barely glances at them."Yes?""It's all in there," she says."You haven't knelt yet.You give more respect to your father, I'm sure.To the city pillar, for certain. ""My father is dead. ""And Bangkok will drown.It doesn't mean you shouldn't show respect. "Kanya fights the urge to take out her baton and club him.Gibbons smiles at her resistance."Shall we chat awhile then, first?"he asks."Jaidee always liked to talk.No?I can see from your expression you despise me.You think I'm some murderer, perhaps?Some killer of children?You won't break bread with one such as me?""You are a killer. ""Your killer.Your tool entirely.What does that make you?"He watches her, amused.It feels to Kanya as if the man is using his eyes to carefully cut open her innards, lifting and examining each organ in turn: lungs, stomach, liver, heart  Gibbons smiles slightly."You want me dead. "His pale mottled face splits into a wider grin, his eyes mad and intense."You should shoot me if you hate me so. "When Kanya doesn't respond, he throws up his hands in disgust."Fuck me, you're all so shy!Kip's the only one of you who's worth a damn. "His eyes turn to the girl where she swims, watches her, mesmerized for a moment."Go ahead and kill me.I'd be happy to die.I'm only alive because you keep me this way. ""Not for much longer. "The doctor looks down at his paralyzed legs, laughs."No.Not for long.And then what will you do when AgriGen and its ilk launch another assault?When spores float to you from Burma?When they wash up on the beach from India.Will you starve the way the Indians did?Will your flesh rot off you as it did for the Burmese?Your country only stays one step ahead of the plagues because of me, and my rotting mind. "He waves at his legs."Will you rot with me?"He pulls aside his blankets, shows the sores and scabs on his pale fishy legs, pasty with the loss of blood and weals of suppurating flesh."Will you die like this?"He grins mirthlessly.Kanya looks away."You deserve it.It's your kamma.Your death will be painful. ""Karma?Did you say karma?"The doctor leans closer, brown eyes rolling, tongue lolling."And what sort of karma is it that ties your entire country to me, to my rotting broken body?What sort of karma is it that behooves you to keep me, of all people, alive?"He grins."I think a great deal about your karma.Perhaps it's your pride, your hubris that is being repaid, that forces you to lap seedstock from my hand.Or perhaps you're the vehicle of my enlightenment and salvation.Who knows?Perhaps I'll be reborn at the right hand of Buddha thanks to the kindnesses I do for you. ""That's not the way it works. "The doctor shrugs."I don't care.Just give me another like Kip to fuck.Throw me another of your sickened lost souls.Throw me a windup.I don't care.I'll take what flesh you throw me.Just don't bother me.I'm beyond worrying about your rotting country now. "He tosses the papers into the pool.They scatter across the water.Kanya gasps, horrified, and nearly lunges after them before steeling herself and forcing herself to draw back.She will not allow Gibbons to bait her.This is the way of the calorie man.Always manipulating.Always testing.She forces herself to look away from the parchment slowly soaking in the pool and turn her eyes to him.Gibbons smiles slightly."Well?Are you going to swim for them or not?"He nods at Kip."My little nymph will help you.I'd enjoy seeing you two little nymphs frolicking together. "Kanya shakes her head."Get them out yourself. ""I always like it when an upright person such as yourself comes before me.A woman with pure convictions. "He leans forward, eyes narrowed."Someone with real qualifications to judge my work. ""You were a killer. ""I advanced my field.It wasn't my business what they did with my research.You have a spring gun.It's not the manufacturer's fault that you are likely unreliable.That you may at any time kill the wrong person.I built the tools of life.If people use them for their own ends, then that is their karma, not mine. ""AgriGen paid you well to think so. ""AgriGen paid me well to make them rich.My thoughts are my own. "He studies Kanya."I suppose you have a clean conscience.One of those upright Ministry officers.As pure as your uniform.As clean as sterilizer can make you. "He leans forward."Tell me, do you take bribes?"Kanya opens her mouth to retort, but words fail her.She can almost feel Jaidee drifting close.Listening.Her skin prickles.She forces himself not to look over her shoulder.Gibbons smiles."Of course you do.All of your kind are the same.Corrupt from top to bottom. "Kanya's hand slides toward her pistol.The doctor watches, smiling."What?Are you threatening to shoot me?Do you want a bribe from me as well?Would you like me to suck your cunt?To offer you my not quite girl?"He stares at Kanya, hard eyed."You've taken my money already.My life is already shortened and full of pain.What else do you want?Why not take my girl?"Kip looks up expectantly from the pool, treading water.Her body shimmers under the clear ripples of the waves.Kanya looks away.The doctor laughs."Sorry, Kip.We don't have the bribes this one likes. "His drums his fingers on his chair."What about a young boy, then?There's a lovely twelve year old who works my kitchen.He would be happy to perform.The pleasure of a white shirt is always paramount. "Kanya glares at him."I could break your bones. ""Do it then.But hurry up.I want a reason not to help you. ""Why did you help AgriGen for so long?"The doctor's eyes narrow."The same reason you run like a dog for your masters.They paid me in the coin I wanted most. "Her slap rings across the water.The guards start forward, but Kanya is already drawing back, shaking off the sting in her hand, waving away the guards."We're fine.Nothing is wrong. "The guards pause, unsure of their duty and loyalties.The doctor touches his broken lip, examines the blood thoughtfully.Looks up."A sore spot, there How much of yourself have you already sold?"He smiles showing teeth rimed bloody from Kanya's strike."Are you AgriGen's then?Complicit?"He looks into Kanya's eyes."Are you here to kill me?To end my thorn in their side?"He watches closely, eyes peering into her soul, observant, curious."It is only a matter of time.They must know that I am here.That I am yours.The Kingdom couldn't have fared so well for so long without me.Couldn't have released nightshades and ngaw without my help.We all know they are hunting.Are you my hunter, then?Are you my destiny?"Kanya scowls."Hardly.We're not done with you yet. "Gibbons slumps."Ah, of course not.But then, you never will be.That is the nature of our beasts and plagues.They are not dumb machines to be driven about.They have their own needs and hungers.Their own evolutionary demands.They must mutate and adapt, and so you will never be done with me, and when I am gone, what will you do then?We have released demons upon the world, and your walls are only as good as my intellect.Nature has become something new.It is ours now, truly.And if our creation devours us, how poetic will that be?""Kamma," she murmurs."Precisely. "Gibbons leans back, smiling."Kip.Get the pages.Let us see what can be deciphered from this puzzle. "He drums his fingers on his ruined legs, thoughtful.Smirks at Kanya."Let us see how close to death your precious Kingdom lies. "Kip swims to collect the pages, rippling through the water as she gathers them to her, pulling them dripping and limp from the pool.A smile flickers across Gibbons' lips as he watches her swim."You're lucky I like Kip.If I didn't, I would have let you all succumb years ago. "He nods to his guards."The captain will have samples on her bicycle.Get them.We'll take them down into the lab. "Kip finally emerges from the pool and sets the sopping stack of papers on the doctor's lap.He motions and she begins pushing him toward the door of his villa.The doctor waves for Kanya to follow."Come on, then.This won't take long. "* * *   The doctor squints over one of the slides."I'm surprised you think this is an inert mutation. ""Three cases, only. "The doctor looks up."For now. "He smiles."Life is algorithmic.Two becomes four, becomes ten thousand, becomes a plague.Maybe it's everywhere in the population already and we never noticed.Maybe this is end stage.Terminal without symptoms, like poor Kip. "Kanya glances at the ladyboy.Kip gives a gentle return smile.Nothing shows on her skin.Nothing shows on her body.It is not the doctor's disease she dies of.And yet Kanya steps away, involuntarily.The doctor grins."Don't look so worried.You have the same sickness.Life is, after all, inevitably fatal. "He looks into the microscope."Not an indie genehack.Something else.Not a blister rust.Nothing of AgriGen's markings. "Abruptly, he makes a face of disgust."This is nothing interesting for me.Just a stupid mistake by some fool.Hardly worth my intellect at all. ""That's good, then?""An accidental plague kills just as surely. ""Is there a way to stop it?"The doctor picks up a crust of bread.A greenish mold covers it.He eyes the stuff."So many growing things are beneficial to us.And so many are deadly. "He offers the piece of bread to Kanya."Try it. "Kanya recoils.Gibbons grins and takes a bite.Offers it again."Trust me. "Kanya shakes her head, forcing herself not to mouth superstitious prayers to Phra Seub for luck and cleanliness.She envisions the revered man sitting in a lotus, forces herself not to respond to the doctor's taunts, touches her amulets.The doctor takes another bite.Grins as crumbs cascade down his chin."If you take a bite, I'll guarantee you an answer. ""I wouldn't take anything from your hand. "The doctor laughs."You already have.Every injection you took as a child.Every inoculation.Every booster since. "He offers the bread."This is just more direct.You'll be glad you did. "Kanya nods at the microscope."What is that thing?Do you need to test it more?"Gibbons shakes his head."That?It's nothing.A stupid mutation.A standard outcome.We used to see them in our labs.Junk. ""Then why haven't we ever seen it before?"Gibbons makes a face of impatience."You don't culture death the way we do.You don't tinker with the building blocks of nature. "Interest and passion flicker briefly in the old man's eyes.Mischief and predatory interests."You have no idea what things we succeeded in creating in our labs.This stuff is hardly worth my time.I hoped you were bringing me a challenge.Something from Drs.Ping and Raymond.Or perhaps Mahmoud Sonthalia.Those are challenges. "For a moment, his eyes lose their cynicism.He becomes entranced."Ah.Now those are worthy opponents. "We are in the hands of a gamesman.In a flash of insight, Kanya understands the doctor entirely.A fierce intellect.A man who reached the pinnacle of his field.A jealous and competitive man.A man who found his competition too lacking, and so switched sides and joined the Thai Kingdom for the stimulation it might provide.An intellectual exercise for him.As if Jaidee had decided to fight a muay thai match with his hands tied behind his back to see if he could win with kicks alone.We rest in the hands of a fickle god.He plays on our behalf only for entertainment, and he will close his eyes and sleep if we fail to engage his intellect.A horrifying thought.The man exists only for competition, the chess match of evolution, fought on a global scale.An exercise in ego, a single giant fending off the attacks of dozens of others, a giant swatting them from the sky and laughing.But all giants must fall, and then what must the Kingdom look forward to?It makes Kanya sweat, thinking about it.Gibbons is watching her."You have more questions for me?"Kanya shakes off her terror."You're sure about this?You know what we need to do, already?You can tell just by looking?"The doctor shrugs."If you don't believe me, then go back and follow your standard methods.Textbook your way to your deaths.Or you can simply burn your factory district to the ground and root out the problem. "He grins."Now there's a blunt instrument solution for you white shirts.The Environment Ministry was always fond of those. "He waves a hand."This garbage isn't particularly viable, yet.It mutates quickly, certainly, but it is fragile, and the human host is not ideal.It needs to be rubbed on the mucus membranes: in the nostrils, in the eyes, in the anus, somewhere close to blood and life.Somewhere it can breed. ""Then we're safe.It's no worse than a hepatitis or fa' gan. ""But much more inclined to mutate. "He looks at Kanya again."One other thing you should know.The manufacturer you want will have chemical baths.Someplace where they can culture biological products.A HiGro factory.An AgriGen facility.A windup manufactory.
