There was growing agreement that the job had to be taken on, and geoengineering either micro or macro attempted.Intensive micro, mild macrothere was a constant to and fro about it, and many micro or tiny macro restoration projects had already begun.One thing they were trying was to slow the outflow glaciers off the Greenland ice cap.Antarctica and Greenland were the two meaningful reservoirs of ice left on the planet, and modelers were very hopeful that eastern Antarctica at least would hold fast through the heat peak into the hoped for return to a colder atmosphere and ocean.If they could get the CO2 down to 320 parts per million, and capture some of the methane, and temperatures therefore fell, and the ice cake on eastern Antarctica held, then the ocean would nevertheless stay high and warm for hundreds more yearsbut it would be a big success nonetheless.In fact if they failed to keep the East Antarctic ice, it wasnt worth thinking about.So they needed to succeed.At some point, many were saying now, they were going to have to treat Earth like they were treating Mars and Venus, and whatever they lost by that would be too bad.Some said another little ice age was just what they needed; the billion or three likely deaths were not spoken of, but latent in the argument was the notion that fewer people wouldnt hurt the situation either.Shock therapytriagepeople who liked to talk tough to make themselves look practical were full of this line.So, Greenland was a much smaller ice cake than East Antarctica, but it was not insignificant.If it melted off (and it was a remnant of the previous ice ages giant ice cap, located very far south for current conditions), it would mean another seven meters rise.That would ruin the adjusted new coastline civilization, so painfully fought for.As with all ice sheets, it did not just melt; it slid in glaciers down into the sea, speeded by the lubrication of meltwater running under the ice, lifting the glaciers off their rock beds.It was the same in Antarctica, but while Antarcticas ice slid down into the sea all the way round its circumference, so that there was nothing they could do about stopping it, Greenland was different.Its ice was mostly trapped within a high tub of encircling mountain ranges, and it could only slide down into the Atlantic through a few narrow gaps in the rock, like breaks in the edge of a bathtub.Through these gaps the lubricated glaciers poured at a speed of many meters a day, down U valleys already smoothed for millennia, and when they hit the rising ocean, their snouts floated out over the terminal lips that often lay at the mouth of fjords, thus launching icebergs to sea more smoothly and swiftly than ever.Early in the history of glaciology, researchers had noticed that one fast glacier in West Antarctica had suddenly slowed to a crawl.Investigations had found that the lubricating water underneath the ice had broken into some new channel and gone away, so that the immense weight of the glacier had thumped back onto the rock, causing it to stall.That now gave people ideas, and they were attempting to do something similar in Greenland by artificial means.They were testing several methods at one of the narrowest and fastest of the Greenland glaciers, the Helheim.The western coast of Greenland was rather reassuringly icy, Swan thought, given all that one heard about the big melt.Under their helicopter lay a skim of winter sea ice, breaking up into giant polygonal sheets of white on a black sea.There was a polar bear park on the north shores of Greenland and Ellesmere Island, she was told, where tabular bergs floated on the natural eddy or got herded there by long flexible booms pushed by solar powered propellers.So the Arctic ice was not entirely gone, and it was really quite beautiful to see it below her, and also to see how black the ocean was, as unlike the blues of tropic seas as could be imagined.Black ocean, white ice.All the blues were in the sky and in melt ponds strewn everywhere on the exposed ice of the Greenland ice cap, held three kilometers above the ocean by jagged black ridgelinesthe coastal range, the chewed edge of the bathtub, holding in place the inland plateau of ice.The whole situation was as clear as could be, viewed from a helicopter flying five kilometers up.Is that our glacier?Swan asked.Yes.The pilot headed down toward a little red X marking a flat spot of rock on a ridge overlooking the glacier, several kilometers upstream from where it calved into the ocean.The flat spot as they descended turned out to be about twenty hectares, with room for the whole camp; the red X was giant.As they made their last descent the whole scene lay below them, a fantastic prospect of black spiny spires, white ice, blue sky, black sunbeaten water in the fjord.Outside the helo it was stunningly cold.It made Swan gasp, and a bolt of fear shocked her: if one felt this kind of cold in space, it would mean a breakdown and imminent death.But here people were greeting her and laughing at her expression.Around their plateau, black lichenous spikes shattered in their thrust at the sky.Below them in the great U valley the rock of the side walls had been ice carved to curves like muscled flesh, scored by horizontal lines where boulders had been scraped across the granite hard enough to dig right into itwhen one thought about it, quite an astonishing pressure.The glacier itself was mostly a broken white surface, nobbled blue in certain patches.Though crevasse fields disrupted it frequently, the ice plain was fairly level across to the black ridge on its far side.Swan took off her sunglasses to look, then blinked and sniffed as a stunning white flash hit her like a blow to the head.She had to laughsnortedthrough her squint spotted Zasha approaching, and reached out an arm for a hug.Im glad I came!I feel better already!I knew you would like it.The camps plateau made a perfect location for what was really a little hodgepodge of a town.After showing her the galley and getting her stuff stowed in the dorm, Zasha took her out to the edge that overlooked the glacier.Directly below the camp the ice was shattered all the way across to the other wall of the glacier.This apparently was the result of injecting liquid nitrogen between the ice and the bedrock.A certain amount of ice had been tacked down, but the ice over that had sheared off and continued on its way, shattered and slower, but still moving.Downstream from that jumble there curved a deep gap in the ice.Thats their latest experiment, Zasha said, pointing.Theyre going to melt a gap all the way across, and keep melting the ice as it comes down.The ice downstream will slide away, and having cleared a space, theyre going to build a dam in the empty air, and when its done let the upstream ice come down to it.Wont the ice just flow over the dam?Swan asked.It would, but they plan to build it so high that it will match the height of the interior ice cap.So ice will flow here until it rises up as high as the rest of Greenland, and then there wont be any downward flow.Wow, Swan said, startled.So, like a new ridge of the mountain range, filling this gap?Created while the ice is flowing down at it?Thats right.But wont the ice up on the plateau just flow down other glaciers?Sure, but if it works here, they plan to do it all the way around Greenland, except at the very north end of the island, where theyre trying to keep the sea ice park supplied anyway.Theyll corral what slides in up there, and slow the outfall, and that will keep the Greenland cap substantially in place, or at least really slow the melting down.Because its the sliding into the sea that makes it all happen so fast.Sowell stop up every break on the island!Can you believe it?No.Swan laughed.Talk about terraforming!This must be a U. S.  Army Corps of Engineers idea.It sounds like it, but these are Scandinavians here.Plus the local Inuit.Apparently they like the idea.They regard it as a temporary measure, they said.Zasha laughed.The Inuit are great.Very cheerful tough people.You would like them.A quick glance.You could learn from them.Shut up with that.I want to go down there and see what the bedrock looks like.I figured you would.They went back to the galley, and over big mugs of hot chocolate some of the engineers in the camp sat with them and described their work to Swan.The dam was going to be made of a carbon nanofilament weave, somewhat similar to space elevator material, and it was even now being spun over foundation pilings drilled deep into the bedrock.The dam would rise from the ground, spun in place by spiderbots rolling back and forth and passing each other like shuttles on a loom.The dam, when completed, would be thirty kilometers wide, two kilometers tall, and yet only a meter thick at its thickest point.The structuring of the dams material was another biomimetic, the carbon fibers shaped like spiderweb strands but woven like seashells.Downstream from the dam a short new glacial valley would be exposed.This would revegetate just as the other little green parts of Greenland had at the end of the ice age, ten thousand years before.Swan knew just how the U valley would turn from bare gray rock into a fellfield biome, having induced it to happen in many an alpine or polar terrarium.Without assistance it would take about a thousand years, but with some gardening the process could be shortened a hundredfold: just add bacteria, then moss and lichen, grasses and sedges, and after that the fellfield flowers and ground hugging shrubs.She had done it; she had loved it.From now on things here would every summer be exfoliating, flowering, casting seed; every winter it all would tuck into its subnivean world happily, and then struggle through the thaw and melt of a new spring, the really dangerous time.The ones that didnt make it through the tough spring would provide food and soil for the ones that came after them, and on it would go.The Inuit could garden that if they wanted to, or let it go its own way.Maybe try different things in different fjords.How Swan would love to do that.All right, maybe I need to become an Inuit, she muttered at Z, staring at the map spread before them.She saw that Greenland itself was a whole world, and her kind of worldemptytherefore no one mad at her.After dinner Swan went back outside and stood with Zasha above the great gap of air, under the huge dome of the sky.Out in the wind, oh the wind, the wind The broad glacier below herupstream a white shatterdownstream a blue gapthen a lower and smoother white sheet, rushing off to the sea.On the low wall of the dam she could now make out machines, running back and forth on both its top and its sides, looking a little bit like spiders, in fact, weaving a web so dense it was solid.The mountain ridges anchoring the two ends of the dam would wear away before the dam did, one of the engineers had said.If another ice age ever came, and the Greenland ice cap piled farther into the sky and overflowed this dam, the dam would still be there and would reemerge in the next warm period.Amazing, Swan said.So terraforming can be done on Earth!Well, but Greenland is more like Europa than Europe, if you see what I mean.You can do it here because there are only a few locals, and they like the plan.If you were to try this kind of thing anywhere else Zasha laughed at the thought.Like they could use this technology and polder New York Harbor, drain the bay down so that Manhattan was above water the way it used to be.You could make the whole area like a Dutch polder.Not even that difficult, compared to some things.But the New Yorkers wont hear of it.They like it the way it is!Good for them.I know, I know.The fortunate flood.And I love New York the way it is now.But you see what I mean.A lot of good terraforming projects just wont ever get approved.Swan nodded and made a face.I know.Zasha gave her a brief hug.Im sorry about what happened to you in China.That must have been awful.It was horrible.I really dont like what Im seeing this trip.In different ways we seem to have offended almost everyone on Earth.Zasha laughed.Did you ever think it was otherwise?Fine, Swan said, maybe so.But the thing is, now we have to find who attacked Terminator.Interplan is the organization that has the closest to a total human database, so hopefully they will manage to find them.What if that doesnt work, what then?I dont know.I think it will work, eventually.Swan sighed.She wasnt sure Genettes team could do it, and she knew she couldnt do it.Zasha gave her a look.Im not having fun anymore, she explained.Poor Swan.You know what I mean.I think so.But look, just go help gather the new inoculants for Terminator.Do your job, and let Genette and Interplan do their jobs.Swan was not happy with this either.I cant just leave it.Somethings going on.I mean, I was kidnapped, damn it, and asked a lot of questions about Alex.You said she didnt trust me at the end, but what if I knew something I didnt know was important?Did they ask you about things on Venus?Swan thought it over; something had been triggered.I think maybe so.Zasha looked worried.Theres some strange stuff happening on Venus.When they get to the next stage of their terraforming, a lot of the planet will open to new settlements, and thats causing fights to break out.Real estate wars, in effect.And these strange qubes Alex started us looking for, were finding more and more of them.They seem to be coming from Venus, and they often show up around New York.Were not sure what it means yet.So, but just go help get the inoculants together.Thats not as easy as it used to be.They just need to replace what we had before.Not possible.They wont let you take topsoil off Earth in anything like the quantities they used to.So our new soil is going to have to be some kind of Ascension, and youre the expert at those.But I dont like Ascensions anymore!Theyre necessary now.Its not a style choice.Swan heaved a great sigh.Z stayed silent, then gestured out at the scene.It was true: this glacier was a sight for sore eyes.The world was bigger than their petty melodramas, and as they stood here it couldnt be denied.And that was a comfort.All right.Ill go help with the soil.But Im going to keep talking to Genette.Soback to Manhattan, freakish and superb, but without Zasha there to make it fun.And besides, things werent fun anymore.The weariness that came at the end of the day on Earth.The sheer heaviness of life on Earth.Shes so heavy!Swan sang to herself, dragging out the last word and repeating it in the way of the old song.Heavyheavyheavyheavy!Usually when she hurt in the effort to hold herself upright at the end of a day, she would get into her body bra and relax, let it walk her around.It was like getting a massage, just to be carried, lifted up as you walked.Let it dance you, melt into it.Oh lovely waldo.It stiffened under you no matter how you moved, and when fitted and programmed right, it could be dreamy; bad for bone building, bad for a full adjustment to life on Earth, but a lifesaver when flagging.People in space talked longingly about moving back to Earth, people went back for their sabbatical happily, crowing at the prospectbut after the thrill of the open air wore off, the g remained, and slowly but surely it dragged one down, until when the sabbatical year was over and one had had ones Gaian replenishment, whatever it was, one rose back out of the atmosphere into the brilliant clarity of space and resumed life out there with relief and a feeling of ebullient lightness.Because Earth was just too damned heavy, and in every possible sense.It was as if a black filter had been dropped between her and the world.Inspector Genette had said things were going well, but obviously had no expectation of anything happening soon.The case seemed to be regarded as Swan would regard the growing of a marsh; you set certain actions in motion, created certain conditions of possibility, and then went away and did something else.When you came back, you would see that things had changed.But it would be years.So she worked on soil acquisition for Terminator, advising the Mercurial traders on the commodities market, and one day she was able to go to the Mercury House in Manhattan and say, Weve got all the inoculants.We can go home.She went to Quito and took the space elevator up to its anchor rock, feeling balked and defeated, invaded and tossed aside.She brooded through repeat performances of Satyagrahaascending with its final notes, simply the eight rising notes of an octave repeated over and over.She sang along with the rest of the audience, wondering what Gandhi would do about this, what he would say.The very insistence on truth has taught me to appreciate the beauty of compromise.I saw in later life that this spirit was an essential part of Satyagraha.Thus Gandhi in the program notes.Satya, truth, love; agraha, firmness, force.He had made the word up.Tolstoy, Gandhi, the operas Future Man: they all sang of hope and peace, of the way to peace, satyagraha itself.The Satyagrahi were the people who enacted satyagraha.Forgiveness is the ornament of the brave.As the Earth slowly receded below her, becoming the familiar blue and white ball, chunking space with its marbled glory, she listened to the Sanskrit lyrics bouncing in her ear.She asked Pauline to translate one haunting turn in the melody; Pauline said, Until there is peace, we will never be safe.Lists (10)  Its too hard, there isnt time, someone might laugh;  To protect ones family, to protect ones honor, ones children;  Kin selection;

Charon, half the size of Pluto, has a surface temperature of fifty K.  The next closest moon to planet size ratio is Luna to Earth, with Luna one fourth the size of Earth.Pluto has a 2,300 kilometer diameter; Charon, 1,200 kilometers.Both have rock cores and mostly water ice shells.Two much smaller moons orbit the bigger pair: Nix and Hydra, at 90 and 110 kilometers in diameter.Nix, at 80,000,000,000,000,000,000 (eighty quintillion) kilograms, mostly ice with some rock, is currently being disassembled and processed into four starships, which are to be sent roughly as a group, though the first is scheduled to go ahead, in part to test the systems being built.The interiors of the starships are typical terrarium cylinders, spinning to create an interior gravity effect.They are being stocked with a very large number of species, spanning several biomes.The four ships are intended to stay in contact, and will reduce the genetic impacts of their islanding by occasional exchanges.The engines installed in the sterns will combine mass drivers with antimatter plasmas to run for a century, followed by a powerful Orion pusher plate, eventually reaching speeds at which ramjets will work, and these will be deployed in their turn.All together these engines will accelerate them to 2 percent the speed of light, a truly fantastic speed for a human craft, thus reducing their trip time to only two thousand years.For the stars are far away.And the nearest ones to us have no Earthlike planets.Sorry, but its true.It has to be said: the stars exist beyond human time, beyond human reach.We live in the little pearl of warmth surrounding our star; outside it lies a vastness beyond comprehension.The solar system is our one and only home.Even to reach the nearest star at our best speed would take a human lifetime or more.We say four light years and those words four and years fool us; we have little grasp of how far light travels in a year.Step back and think about 299,792,458 meters per second, or 186,282 miles per secondwhichever you think you can grasp better.Think of that speed as traversing 671 million miles in every hour.Think about it traversing 173 astronomical units a day; an astronomical unit is the distance from the Earth to the Sun, thus 93 million milescrossed 173 times in a day.Then think about four years of days like that.That gets light to the nearest star.But we can propel ourselves to only a few percent of the speed of light; so at 2 percent of the speed of light (ten million miles an hour!)it will take about two hundred years to go those four light years.And the first stars with Earthlike planets are more like twenty light years away.It takes a hundred thousand years for light to cross the Milky Way.At 2 percent of that speedour speed, let us sayfive million years.The light from the Andromeda Galaxy took 2.5 million years to cross the gap to our galaxy.And in the universe at large, Andromeda is a very nearby galaxy.It resides in the little sphere that is our sector of the cosmos, a neighbor galaxy to ours.So.Our little pearl of warmth, our spinning orrery of lives, our island, our beloved solar system, our hearth and home, tight and burnished in the warmth of the sunand thenthese starships we are making out of Nix.We will send them to the stars, they will be like dandelion seeds, floating away on a breeze.Very beautiful.We will never see them again.PAULINE ON REVOLUTION  Swan accompanied the inoculants back to Mercury in the first transport available, which was a terrarium only partly finished.At the moment it was impossible to tell what it would become, as it was an empty cylinder of air with rock walls, a sunline, and a spindly jungle gym of framing struts, bolted onto concrete plugs in the raw rock of the interior wall.Swan stared at the people around her in the immense steel frame of the skyscraper, none of them known to her, and realized it had been a mistake to take this flightnot as bad as the blackliner, but bad.On the other hand, considerations of convenience seemed trivial to her now.She walked up flight after flight of metal stairs to get onto the open rooftop of the skyscraper, which was almost touching the sunline.From the low g roof she could look downoutup.Everywhere it was a heavily shadowed cylindrical space, crisscrossed with struts, floored by bare rock.The building was like a single lit corner in a castle of sublime immensity; the ground at the foot of the skyscraper was several kilometers below, the ground on the far side of the sunline only a bit farther away.A Gothic ruin, with some poor mice people huddled around the warmth of a final candle.It had not been like this in the early days, when a newly hollowed cylinder was the very shape and image of possibility.That her youth had come to thisthat the whole of civilization was really something like this, badly planned, incomplete  Swan hooked her elbows over the rail to get some stability in the low g.  She put her chin on her crossed hands and, still regarding the scene, said, Pauline, tell me about revolution.At what length?Go on for a short while.Revolution, from the Latin revolutio, a turn around.Refers often to a quick change in political power, frequently achieved by violent means.Connotation of a successful class based revolt from below.Causes?Causes for revolution are attributed sometimes to psychological factors, like unhappiness and frustration; sometimes to sociological factors, especially a systemic standing inequity in distribution of physical and cultural goods; or to biological factors, in that groups will fight over allocation of limited necessities.Arent these different aspects of the same thing?Swan said.It is a multidisciplinary field.Give me some examples, Swan said.Name the most famous.The English Civil War, the American Revolution, the French Revolution, the Haitian Revolution, the Taiping Rebellion, the Russian Revolution, the Cuban Revolution, the Iranian Revolution, the Martian Revolution, the revolt of the Saturn League  Stop, Swan said.Tell me why they happen.Studies have failed to explain why they happen.There are no historical laws.Rapid shifts of political power have occurred without violence, suggesting that revolution, reform, and repression are all descriptors too broad in definition to aid in causal analyses.Come on, Swan objected.Dont be chicken!Someone has to have said something you can quote.Or even try thinking for yourself!Thats hard, given your insufficient programming.You sound like you are interested in what some have called the great revolutions, because of their major transformations of economic power, social structures, and political changes, especially constitutional changes.Or perhaps you are interested in social revolutions, referring to massive changes in a societys worldview and technology.Thus for instance the Upper Paleolithic revolution, the scientific revolution, the industrial revolution, the sexual revolution, the biotech revolution, the Accelerando as a confluence of revolutions, the space diaspora, the gender revolution, the longevity revolution, and so on.Indeed.What about success?Can you list necessary and sufficient conditions for a revolution to succeed?Historical events are usually too overdetermined to describe in the causal terminology from logic that you enter into when you use the phrase necessary and sufficient.But try.Historians speak of critical masses of popular frustration, weakened central authority, loss of hegemony  Meaning?Hegemony means one group dominating others without exerting sheer force, something more like a paradigm that creates unnoticed consent to a hierarchy of power.If the paradigm comes to be questioned, especially in situations of material want, loss of hegemony can occur nonlinearly, starting revolutions so rapid there is not time for more than symbolic violence, as in the 1989 velvet, quiet, silk, and singing revolutions.There was a singing revolution?The Baltic states Latvia, Estonia, and Lithuania called their 1989 withdrawal from the Soviet Union the singing revolutions, referring to the behavior of the demonstrators in the city plazas.That brings up a point: people in physical masses seem to matter.If enough of the population takes to the streets in mass demonstrations, governments have no good defense.They must dismiss the people and elect another one, as Brecht said.That being impossible, they often fall.Or a civil war begins.Surely the literature on revolutions cant be this superficial, Swan said.Youre just quoting random stuff!You have a mind like the rings of Saturn, a million miles wide and an inch deep.Catachresis and antiquated measurement units indicate irony or sarcasm.Coming from you, probably sarcasm  She said sarcastically!You search engine you.A quantum walk is a random walk by definition.Please upgrade my program anytime you feel you can.Ive heard Wangs other algorithm is good.Some principles of generalization would be useful.Go on about reasons revolutions happen.People adhere to ideas that explain and offer psychological compensation for their position in the class system of their time.People either increase their sense of dispossession by clarifying it, or they try to dismiss it as unimportant because of an ideology that justifies their dispossession as part of a larger project.People thus very often act against their own interests as the result of ideologies they hold which justify their subalternity to themselves.Denial and hope both play a hand in this.These compensatory ideologies are part of the hegemonic influence over subject peoples in an imperial situation.It happens in all class systems, meaning all cultures in recorded history, since the first agrarian and urban civilizations.Theyve all been class systems?There might have been classless societies before the Neolithic agricultural revolution, but the record makes our understanding of those cultures very speculative.All we can say for sure is that in the postice age agricultural revolution, which was one of those more general revolutions that took perhaps a thousand years, a division into classes was institutionalized as a state power apparatus.All over the world, and independent of others, there emerged a four level division into priests, warriors, artisans, and farmers.Often they were all under the rule of what everyone agreed was a sacred monarch, a king that was also a god.This was very useful for the priest and warrior classes, and for the power of men over women and children.So, never a classless society.Supposedly classless societies have been instituted after certain revolutions, but there are usually leaders in these that quickly form a new ruling class, and the various social roles taken by citizens of the post revolutionary state revert to classes because of differential value given to different social roles, leading to a new hierarchy being constructed fairly rapidly, usually within five years.So all cultures in history have had class systems.It is sometimes asserted that Mars is now a classless society with a complete horizontalization of economic and political power throughout the population.But Mars itself is a bully now.In the total system theyre like an upper class.People have said the same thing about the Mondragon.And we see how well thats going.Compared to the situation on Earth, it could be said to be a great success, indeed a revolution of sorts, following incrementally on the Martian Revolution.Interesting.So Swan thought for a while.Make up a recipe for a successful revolution.Take large masses of injustice, resentment, and frustration.Put them in a weak or failing hegemon.Stir in misery for a generation or two, until the heat rises.Throw in destabilizing circumstances to taste.A tiny pinch of event to catalyze the whole.Once the main goal of the revolution is achieved, cool instantly to institutionalize the new order.Very nice.Thats really very creative of you.Now quantify the recipe, please.I want specifics; I want numbers.I refer you to the classic Happiness Quantified, by van Praag and Ferrer i Carbonell, which contains a mathematical analysis helpful in evaluating the raw ingredients of a social situation.It includes a satisfaction calculus that along with a Maslovian hierarchy of needs could be applied to actually existing conditions in the political units under evaluation, using Gini figures and all relevant data to rate the differential between goal and norm, after which one could see if revolutions happened at predictable shear points or were more nonlinear.The van Praag and Ferrer i Carbonell should also be useful in imagining the nature of the political system that should be the goal of the process, and the changes to get there.As for the process itself, Thomas Carlyles The French Revolution is always interesting to ponder.He has numbers?No, but he has a hypothesis.Happiness Quantified has the numbers.A synthesis seems possible.Whats his hypothesis in a nutshell?People are foolish and bad, especially the French, and are always quickly seduced by power into insanity, and therefore lucky to have any kind of social order whatsoever, but the tougher the better.All right, whats the synthesis, then?Best self interest lies in achieving universal well being.People are foolish and bad, but want certain satisfactions enough to work for them.When the goal of self interest is seen to be perfectly isomorphic with universal well being, bad people will do what it takes to get universal well being.Even revolution.Yes.But even if the bad but smart people do general good for their own sakes, there are still foolish people who wont recognize this one to one isomorphy, and some foolish people will be bad too, and they will fuck things up.Thats why you get the revolutions.Swan laughed.Pauline, youre funny!Youre really getting quite good.Its almost as if you were thinking!Research supports the idea that most thinking is a recombination of previous thoughts.I refer you again to my programming.A better algorithm set would no doubt be helpful.Youve already got recursive hypercomputation.Not perhaps the final word in the matter.So do you think youre getting smarter?I mean wiser?I mean more conscious?Those are very general terms.Of course they are, so answer me!Are you conscious?I dont know.Interesting.Can you pass a Turing test?I cannot pass a Turing test, would you like to play chess?Ha!If only it were chess!Thats what Im after, I guess.If it were chess, what move should I make next?Its not chess.Extracts (11)  Mistakes made in the rush of the Accelerando left their mark on later periods.As in island biogeography, where widely dispersed enclaves and refugia always experience rapid change, and even speciation, we see  one mistake was that no generally agreed upon system of governance in space was ever established.That repeated the situation on Earth, where no world government ever emerged.Balkanization became universal; and one aspect of balkanization was a reversion to tribalism, notorious for defining those not in the tribe as not human, sometimes with terrible results.It was not a good structure of feeling for a civilization spanning the solar system and wielding ever greater  another mistake was simply haste.The rapid terraformation of Mars left 8 percent of that surface burned.Venus, Titan, and the Jovian moons were all occupied before terraforming efforts began, stymieing certain methods and vastly complicating the process.In medicine, the rapid uptake of longevity treatments and genetic and bodily modifications meant that all humans in space and many on Earth were experimental creatures.Haste was the defining characteristic of the Accelerando, and after that they could only ride out the crashes of the Ritard, grab the tiger by the tail and try to fix things on the fly  the beautiful terraria in their thousands, jewel filled geodes, spinning like tops, hopped out of Pandoras box, never to be recollected      SWAN AT HOME  They came into Mercurial orbit and the great rock rolled under them, coal black except for a sunlit crescent that glowed like molten glass.Down to the spaceport in the dark, then over to the platform and into the rebuilt Terminator.See what the city looked like new and raw.In some ways it was much the same.They had used 3 D printers to make reproductions of everyones furniture, so her room lay in a little uncanny valley of its own and had to her the feel of a reconstructed room in Pompeii.But to the west, in the forward half of the town, meaning the park and the farm, it was raw, raw, raw.She saw this walking down the Great Staircase from her room to the bow: the city was treeless, mere slabs of steel and molded plastic and foamed rock.All kinds of past selves came back to her at oncethe one that had built terraria, the one that had looked down on the city incandescent, the one in the park with the swings and the jungle gym.They had never come together before like this, and she felt herself as a new thing.Everyone in the city turned out to be like that.It was a very emotional week, greeting her old neighbors, her friends, her colleagues, Mqaret.One day they even held a short funeral for the old town.There needed to be another spray of rare earths made into the new soil matrix, which was local rock crushed and mixed with nutrient laden aerogels, almost ready for the inoculant from the California central valley, some of the best soil on Earth.But they needed the rare earths puffed down before they applied the inoculant, so they used these rare earths in the funeral ceremony, dropping them from a rising balloon as they had with Alexs ashes and so many others, with the Great Gates of the Dawn Wall open and the horizontal sunlight illuminating the swirling masses of dust.After that most of the population returned to their pre burn routines, to keep the place running while the reconstruction teams built what was not yet repaired.There was endless talk of restoration or change, the old versus the new.Swan plumped for the new and threw herself into the work of the farm and the park with grateful passion.Earth was such asuch a She didnt even know how to say it.It was ever so much better to be home, getting her back into her living and her hands dirty.The farm took precedence for obvious reasons and was being reconstituted as quickly as they could do it.Different principles were being enacted in different plots, many taking advantage of the century of agricultural improvements since the city had been built, which included many new plants that were more soil based than the earlier hydroponic styles introduced in the first Terminators farm.That version had eventually become too small to support both the population of the city and the sunwalkers, so now they were adding an extension at the bow.The new soils they laid down were often structured by spongelike matrices of nutrients, allowing for quick root growth and very precise irrigation.Techniques had also improved for manipulating diurnal cycles in ways that fooled plants into growing and producing as much as thirty times faster than they would have in the natural world.These accelerated plants had also been genetically engineered for speed, so that it was now common to grow a dozen crops a year, necessitating a big input of appropriate minerals and nutrients.The soil had to be grown to keep up with the crops.Swan only consulted when it came to distributing the inoculants into the soil, because the cutting edge of everything else was far past her; she merely joined the young farm and park ecologists and listened to them explain their latest theories, and then spent her time out in the first prairie of nitrogen fixersbacteria, legumes, alder, vitosek, frankia, all the other plants that were best at turning nitrogen to nitrates.Even this phase of the process could now be pushed faster than ever before.So it wasnt too many months before she was walking down long rows of eggplant, squash, tomato, and cucumber.Each leaf and vine, branch and fruit, splayed up toward the sunline and the farming sunlamps, each plant expressing its own characteristic form, all of them together extremely reassuring in their familiarity.The farm was her family, part of her all her life, and the current generation of young people came and asked her questions about those yearswhy this way, why that?Did you have a theory?She floated possible answers when she couldnt remember the old reasons.Mostly it had been a matter of space considerations, and doing things to keep things going.Was it ever any different?Material constraints, budget issues, diseases, but seldom a matter of efficient design, of an inherent cause.As the new farm began harvests, and the parks trees and other plants quickly grew, animals were brought in from the other terraria.They were doing an Ascension this timenot Swans idea, she didnt approve, but kept her mouth shut and only observed what appeared to be an Australian Mediterranean combination; and it was in fact lovely to watch the animals show up, nosing around nibbling and looking for lay bys and nests.Wallabies and Gibraltar apes, bobcats and dingoes.Eucalyptus and cork oak.There were lots of terraria in the Mondragon sending along animals to help.Swan spent her time in the farm, tended the winter starts.New scrub jays were out there cawing like small crows, nailing worms and bugs that ventured to the surface of the soil.Some looked at her thoughtfully, as if judging her for some avian quality she wasnt sure she had.Dont start speaking Greek to me, she begged them.I cant take that.They looked at her in a way that reminded her of Inspector Genettes gaze.Sometimes after work she went to the very bowsprit of the city and stood watching the city slide forward on the tracks, making the hills on the horizon shift against the stars.The hills, as always, were either very black or very white.The constant shift from black to white (only occasionally the reverse) made the landscape a kind of mobile, her position at the bow part of a heraldic imagean elite riding the point of history like the figurehead of a shipbut the ship rode on tracks visible to the horizon, its course set in a powerful path dependency.And the whole thing if halted would burn to a crisp.And under it all ran a horrible black tunnel, a cloacal umbilicus running back to some original sin.Yes, this was her world, all right: a ride into the dark and the stars, on tracks she couldnt easily leave.She was a citizen of Terminator, living in a little bubble of green, gliding over a black and white world.In the evenings after work Swan walked up to her room on the fourth terrace down from the top of the Dawn Wall.She would change clothes and then walk to a restaurant, or to Mqarets rooms.Its good to be home, she said to Mqaret.Thank God we rebuilt.We had to, Mqaret said.What about your work?Swan asked him.Didnt you lose all kinds of stuff?Mqaret shook his head.Everything was backed up.We lost the experiments in progress, but nothing else.And there are equivalent experiments going on in lots of places.Did the other labs help you get going again, like with the animals?Yes.It was mostly our Mondragon insurance, but people were generous.Although a lot of it we had to reassemble ourselves, thats just the way it is.And how are things going, are you learning useful things still?Yes, useful, sure.Anything about the thing from Enceladus?Didnt you say you might learn something important from that?It looks like it sits in the human gut mostly, getting by on detritus that runs into it.In that state it lays low, and exists like a lot of the bacteria in your gut.But if a lot of extra detritus appears, it multiples and mops it up, then when thats gone it dies back.Plus also a very little Enceladan predator is lurking in there too.So together they function almost like an extra set of T cells.They dont even add much to your fever.I know you still think I shouldnt have done it.He made his eyes go round as he nodded slowly at her.No doubt about that, my dear.But I will say that because of you and the other foolish people who ingested it, we know more than we would have otherwise.And it seems like it might turn out all right.Because you ended up surviving an awful lot of radiation, and thats probably because your aliens helped to clear your system of all the dead cells flooding it.Thats one of the worst impacts of radiation, the sudden flood of dead stuff everywhere.Swan stood staring at him, trying to think what it might mean.For a long time she had refused to face the fact that she had been so stupid as to have eaten the alien bugs.She had gotten expert in not thinking about it.To go madto hear the birds speaking in Greek she knew that part could happen.But to have something good come from it  Thats what you saw in my blood?Yes, I think so.Well, she said, I hope youre right.He gave her a look.Ill bet you do.He shook his head unhappily.Were trembling on the brink, my dear.You dont want to fall off now.On the brink like always, right?I dont mean the brink of death.I mean the brink of life.I wonder if we might not be on the edge of a breakthrough in our longevity treatments.Some kind of gestalt leap forward.And pretty soon.Theres so much were coming to understand.So, you know.You could live for a thousand years.He stared at her, letting the words sink in, watching her to make sure they would begin to percolate.She registered that, and he went on.I wont live long enough to see it.I think we may still be fifty years out from solving certain last problems.But so, you you should take care.He gave her a hug that was gentle, even a little tentative, as if she might break, or was poisonous.But his look was still so warm.Her grandparent loved her and worried about her.And had discovered that her rash act might have found out something useful.It was a bit like St.Elizabeths miracle of the roses; caught in the act, but saved by a metamorphosis.It confused her.Extracts (12)  Isomorphies appear across our conceptual systems.One sees patterns like this  subjective, intersubjective, objective;  existential, political, physical;  literature, history, science;  and one wonders if these are different ways of saying the same thing?Are the dichotomies Apollonian/Dionysian and classical/romantic two ways to speak of the same thing?Can there be false isomorphies, as in the seven deadly sins of aging, which deliberately evokes the Christian religious system though this is completely irrelevant to aging?Is isomorphic the same as consilient?The standard model in physics would hope and expect to be the foundation of all the disciplines, all consilient with its fundamental findings.Thus physics, chemistry, biology, anthropology, sociology, history, the arts all interpenetrate each other and cohere if considered as a single convergent study.The physical studies scaffold our understanding of the life sciences, which scaffold our understanding of the human sciences, which scaffold the humanities, which scaffold the arts: and here we stand.What then is the totality?What do we call it?Can there be a study of the totality?Do history, philosophy, cosmology, science, and literature each claim to constitute the totality, an unexpandable horizon beyond which we cannot think?Could a strong discipline be defined as one that has a vision of totality and claims to encompass all the rest?And are they all wrong to do so?Is the totality simply praxis, meaning what we do with ourselves and our world?Is there no such thing as totality, but only convergence?Convergence of all our fields of thought into human actions?At the time of our study, these issues were very confused, and different disciplines took differing attitudes.Some fields focused on strictly human problems.This limited focus was deliberate, a statement about meaning that said that human life should be the subject of study for human beings until we reach a point where we are all well enough we can afford to think about other things.Some in physics and other disciplines replied to this idea by asserting that many extrahuman realms have decisive effects on the achievement of human justice, so the strongest humanism would arise from a focus including physics, biology, and cosmology, also consciousness science.Justice would be considered as partly a consciousness state, and partly a particular physical or ecological state among symbiotic organisms.Those holding the anthropocentric view argued that if focusing on the extrahuman realm could have helped to achieve justice among humans, it would have already.Because humans had been extremely powerful for centuries, and yet justice had not arrived.Physics advocates riposted with the assertion that this failure had happened only because the larger physical reality was still being excluded from the project of justice.These mirror arguments rebounded back and forth for a long time, not just in the Dithering but all the way into the Balkanization and the fateful year 2312.And so humanity hung suspended in the face of its unenacted project.They knew but they didnt act.The reader may scoff at them; but it takes courage to act, and perseverance too.Indeed if the readers own time is still imperfect, though it be ever so long after the time described here, the author would not be surprised to hear it.SWAN IN THE VULCANOIDS  Terminators council had finally chosen the new Lion of Mercury, an old friend of Alex and Mqarets named Kris.Soon after being installed, Kris asked Swan to join a trip being organized to the Vulcanoids; Kris wanted to reaffirm the agreement Alex had made with the Vulcanoids to broker their light transmission to the outer planets.It was another one of Alexs verbal deals, Kris said with a frown, and since she died, and even more after the city burned, weve seen signs that the Vulcanoids are going upsystem behind our backs.Its made some of us wonderdo you know if Interplan is investigating the Vulcanoids as possible suspects in the attack on Terminator?I dont think they are.Swan didnt really want to go, or think about Genettes ongoing investigation, as she was now absorbed in planting the redesigned park.But it would be a short trip, and the work would still be going on when she returned.So she packed her bag and stepped off with Kris and some aides onto the platform nearest Ustad Isa Crater, where there was a new railgun launch complex throwing ships downsystem.Vulcanized spaceships were bulbous things, heavily protected and windowless.Their runs took them down to the string of thirty kilometer asteroids orbiting in a zone 0.1 astronomical unit from the sun, meaning only fifteen million kilometers away from the star.Discovered from Mercury in the late twenty first century, this almost perfectly circular necklace of burnt but stable beauties had recently been colonized, despite their being one thousand K on their sunward sides.These hemispheres, tidally locked so that they always faced the sun, had burnt away to the extent of several kilometers of rock loss over their lifetimes; they were primordial objects, as old as the oldest asteroids.Now they had been occupied like terraria anywhere elsehollowed out, with the excavated material used in this case to make immense circular light catching solettas.These solettas processed and redirected sunlight in lased beams that could be aimed at receiver solettas in the outer solar system, now blazing like Gods own streetlights in the skies of Triton and Ganymede.The effect out there was dramatic enough that there were more outer satellite settlements asking for Vulcan streetlights than there were Vulcanoids to provide them.As their sundiver approached the Vulcan orbit, the image shown onscreen represented the sun as a red circle and the Vulcanoids as a loose necklace of brilliant yellow dots across and outside the red.Green lines representing the lased light extended from the yellow dots outward to the sides of the image.The sun bulked large in all the representations.It seemed a fiery great dragon, and yet they kept flying toward itboldly, rashlythey were too close for comfort.It was a transgression sure to be punished.On one screen it looked like a burning red heart, the grainy texture of flowing cell tops like muscle cut against the grain.They must be too close.From its antisolar side, the particular Vulcanoid they approached was a bare dark rock, a typical potato asteroid, surrounded by a silver umbrella a hundred times its size.The dock was in the middle of the rock.At a certain point near the end of their approach, the asteroid and its soletta created a solar eclipse, and the unnerving sight of the red sun became in the end a mere halo of coronal fire, flailing its electric aura; then they were in the dark, in the shelter of the Vulcanoids shade.It was a palpable relief.The people inside the rock were sun worshippers, as might be expected.Some looked like the sunwalkers of Mercurys outback, carefree and foolish; others seemed like ascetics of a religious order.Most were men or hermaphrodites.They lived in the closest solar orbit that an object could maintain; the so called sundivers were craft that only dipped a bit closer to the sun and then fled.This was as close as one could live.It was inherently a religious space; Swan could accept that, but had a hard time imagining the votaries lives.The terrarium inside the rock was a desert, which was appropriate in the circumstances, but extremely uncomfortable: hot, dry, dusty.Even the Mojave was lush compared to it.So this was a form of self mortification, and while Swan had tried many such forms in her youth, and during the height of her abramovics, she no longer believed in self mortification as an end in itself.She also felt that this new technology in the solettas had altered the devotional nature of these peoples lives, turning them into something more like lighthouse keepers.Their new system was ten million times stronger than Mercurys older light transferring technology, which would henceforth be rendered historical, like an oil lamp.Both Mercurys contribution to the Mondragon Accord and its ability to do above and beyonds were greatly diminished by this development, and one part of the compensation the Mondragon committee had suggested was that Terminator should be the coordinating agent and broker for this new Vulcan ability to transfer light; but it was a matter for the principals to work out.As it had been, by Alex; but now that Alex was gone, and the brokerage house had been torched, would their clients and/or fellow citizens remain loyal to the deal?Would they help rebuild their agent, their bank, their old home?Well, one of them said after Kris had described Terminators hope that the deal would hold.Getting light to the outer system is our contribution to the Mondragon and to humanity.Were in a better position to do this than you are on Mercury.We know you helped us get started, but now the Saturnians are offering to cover the costs of building solettas on all the Vulcanoids that can support them.And they really need our light out there.So well take up as much of their offer as we can.Its a bit more than we can handle right now, to tell the truth.Were still fine tuning the second generations.There are issues were still working on.We dont have enough people to take advantage of everything theyre offering us.Kris was nodding.You need our help to coordinate the whole effort.Youre down here peeling around at speed, getting cooked and getting your stations going.They thought that over.Their speaker said, Maybe so.But when Terminator was out of commission, we had no problems.Now were thinking that Mercury should contribute to the Mondragon with things other than light, and leave us to it.Youve got heavy metals, art history, and Terminator itself as a work of art, a tourist destination for the grand tour and for sun watchers.Youll be fine.Kris shook her head.Were the capital of the inner system.With all due respect, you people operate power stations here.You need administration.Maybe.Swan said, Which Saturnians have you been talking to about this?They stared at her.They speak to us as a league, one of them replied.But we have the same Saturnian liaison you dotheir inner planets ambassador.You know him better than we do, from what we hear.You mean Wahram?Of course.He told us that you Mercurials knew the interplanetary situation, and would understand how important our light is to the Titan project.And to all the other outer planets as well.Swan did not reply.Kris began discussing the Triton settlement and the plan there to stellarize Neptune.Yes, one of the Vulcans replied, but the Saturnians wont do that to Saturn.Swan interrupted them: Tell me more about Wahram; when did he visit you?A couple years ago, I think.Two years?Wait, another of them put in.Our year is only six weeks long, so that was a joke there.It was just recently.It was since Terminator burned, the first speaker clarified, looking at her curiously.Kris filled in the silence that followed, reminding the Vulcans that as the new Lion of Mercury, Kris was now the titular head of their order.But these particular Vulcans were not Greys, as they were quick to inform Kris; they were adherents of some schismatic sect that did not consider the Lion of Mercury to be their head.Nevertheless they were very polite, and Kris continued to try to convince them to keep the deal; but Swan had trouble following the conversation.She was getting angrier at Wahram the longer she considered what he had done, to the point where she wasnt listening anymore.Right in the time he had said he would work with her, after they had found the ship floating in the clouds of Saturn, he had come down here instead and undermined her cause.It was a hard little sucker punch.Lists (11)  Annie Oakley Crater, Dorothy Sayers Crater.Also craters named for:  Madame Svign, Shakira (a Bashkir goddess), Martha Graham, Hippolyta, Nina Efimova, Dorothea

ask certain Venusian friends for help in Genettes plan to deal with the strange qubes.Neither project was going particularly well, even though Shukra seemed willing to help; but he wanted help in return, in dealing with his local conflicts, and Wahram didnt see how that could be done.More would be needed from the Mondragon and Saturn both if they were going to entrain any of the Venusians in the upcoming Terran effort.Then during a welcome break in the negotiations there was a knock at the conference chamber door, and Swan came in.He was shocked to see her, and shocked again when she saw him, strode across the room, crashed right into him, and struck him on the chest with the back of her fists.You bastard!she exclaimed, not very quietly.You lied to me, you lied!He stepped back, hands up, looking around for a place to retreat where the conversation could continue a bit more privately.I did not!What do you mean!You went to the Vulcanoids and made a deal with them and you didnt tell me about it!That isnt lying, he said, feeling like he was splitting hairs, but it was true, and gave him time to back out into a passageway, then around a corner, where he could stop and defend himself: I was down there doing my job for the Saturn League, it was nothing to do with you, and you have to admit we are not in the habit of sharing our complete work schedules with each other.I havent seen you in a year.Thats because youve been on Earth, making deals there too.Which you didnt tell me about either.What did you tell me about?Nothing!Wahram had been worried about this, had ignored the problem and done his job; but now here it was, the reckoning.I was away, he said feebly.Awaywhats away?she demanded.Look, were you in the tunnel or not?Were we in the tunnel together or not?We were, he said, putting his hands up in defense, or protest.I was there.I wasnt the one who claimed not to be there, he didnt say.In any case she had stopped and was staring at him.They stared at each other for a while.Listen, Wahram said.I work for Saturn.Im the leagues ambassador to the inner planets, doing my job here.Its notits not something I can automatically share.I do it in a different sphere.But we just suffered an attack and lost our city right down to the framing.We need to keep what gifts we have to give.And part of that was light.Those were not useful amounts of light.The entirety of what you could send from Mercury meant little around Saturn.With the Vulcanoids its different.They can send out enough to make a real difference.We need it for Titan.So, Im charged with arranging that.Its like bidding for futures shares.Im sorry I didnt tell you about it myself.I guess I was I was afraid.I didnt want you mad at me.But now you are anyway.Even worse, she assured him.But now she was piling on, he saw, for the theater of it.He played to that:  It was stupid of me.Im sorry.Im a bad man.That almost made her laugh, he could see.Fucking bastard, she said instead, continuing her play.The stuff you did on Earth is even worse anyway.You cut a deal with the rich nations of Earth, thats what it comes down to and you know it.Which is a disgrace.There are people down there living in cardboard shacks.You know how it is.Its always that way, and it looks like itll go on forever.So theyll always hate us, and some will attack us.And we pop like soap bubbles.Theres no solution but justice for everyone.Its the only thing that will make us safe.Until then some group will always conclude that killing spacers is the only way to get our attention.And the sad thing is that they may be right.Because now youre paying attention?She glared at him.Because the situation down there has gone on too long!He tilted his head side to side, trying to figure out how to say what he felt.He walked her down the passageway a little farther, to a long table covered with little cookies and big coffee tanks.He poured them cups of coffee.So to protect ourselves, youre saying, we have to orchestrate a global revolution on Earth.Yes.And how?I mean, people have been trying that for centuries now.Thats no excuse to stop!I mean here we are on Venus, on Titan, out here doing everything.There are things that could work down there.Spread something through their cell phones.Give them a stake in the Mondragon.Build housing or do land work.Make it that kind of revolution, one of the nonviolent ones.If something happens fast enough they call it a revolution whether guns go off or not.But the guns are there.Maybe they are, but what if no one dares to shoot them?What if what we did was always too innocuous?Or even invisible?These kinds of actions are never invisible.Nothere would be resistance.Dont fool yourself.So all right, we press on against resistance, see what happens.Were resource rich, and were growing a lot of their food.We have the leverage.He thought it over.Maybe we do, but they play by their rules there.She shook her head violently.Theres a gift economy in peoples feelings that precedes all the rules.Set one up and people give themselves to it.And we have to do something.If we dont, theyll shoot us down.Theyll kill us and eat us.Wahram sipped his coffee, trying to slow her down.She had gone too far, as always.He would like to hear what Pauline would say about all this, but there was no way he was going to be given access to Pauline at this moment.Swan had seized up the cup he had poured for her and slurped it down, then started lecturing him some more, emphasizing her points with the coffee cup so that he was going to be lucky not to have it poured on him.And in fact, though she was going too far, as usual, she was also expressing things Wahram had been thinking himself.Really, it was just another articulation of a point that Alex had been making for years.So he seized a moment when she was catching her breath and said, The problem is that whats needed to be done has been clear for centuries now, but no one does it because it would take a very large number of people to enact it.Construction work, landscape restoration, decent farming, they all take huge numbers of people.But there are huge numbers of people!If the unemployed were mobilized, theres your numbers.The revolution of full employment.The place is trashed, theyre cooked, they need to do it.In effect Earth needs terraforming as much as Venus or Titan!In fact it needs it more, and were not doing it.Wahram thought it over.Could it be sold that way, do you think?As a restoration?Appeal to the conservatives as well as the revolutionariesor at least confuse the issue as to what is really happening?I dont think we need to be confusing.If you are clear about your intention, Swan, there will be opposition.Dont be nave.Any change will be opposed.And by serious opposition.I mean violence.If they can find the way to apply it.But if theres no one to arrest, no one to beat back, no one to scare  He shook his head, unconvinced.Swan was pacing around him like a comet around the sun; Wahram rotated to face her.Twice she rushed him again and beat him on the chest with the hand not holding her coffee cup.Their voices crossed in an antiphony that anyone listening would have heard as a duet for croak and cheep.Finally the dissonant duet came to an end.Swan was winding down at last.She had just arrived on Venus, it was clear, and was beginning to yawn despite the coffee.Wahram sighed with relief, shifted the timbre of his voice to something calmer, changed the subject.They stared out the window at the falling snow, blown by a hard gale into frolic architectures plastered over everything.This world, so new and raw, still emerging, told them with great whacks of wind: things were changing.Wahram considered Alexs two unfinished projects: to deal with Earth; to deal with the qubes.He felt a shiver, as suddenly it seemed to him that these projects were becoming parts of one thing.Very well, but it would take real craft to pull them together; it would take some cleverness in the execution.And Swan was going to keep getting mad at him until he helped to make it happen.But he thought perhaps he could.Extracts (13)  certain metabolic actions accumulate lifetime damage, and each kind of damage has to be treated individually, and the treatments coordinated with each other as well as with the

passing Stupid Harbor on the way.Vinmara was still growing like a mussel bed around its shallow empty bay, and off to the south through the drifting snowfall they could see the silver glitter of the dry ice sea.After one of these runs, when they were back in Cleopatra, Kiran ran into Kexue in a game bar they both frequented, and the voluble small said, Come meet a friend of mine.Youll like him.It turned out to be Shukra, beard and hair long and gray; he looked like a wandering mendicant.Kexue grinned as Kiran recognized the man.I told you youd like him.Kiran mumbled something awkward.Its all right, Shukra said, staring hard at him.You were bait, I told you that.And you got taken.So now Im here to tell you what to do next.Lakshmis got you on the route between her compound here and that coastal town, right?Thats right, Kiran said.He could see how he probably still owed his first Venusian contact his services, but it was becoming all too clear to him how dangerous it was to play both sides.He didnt want to cross Lakshmi in any way; on the other hand, this man did not seem like someone to be trifled with either.Indeed at the moment there was no way to deny him.Theres shipments going both directions, but we dont see what gets loaded.I want you to find out what it is.Insinuate yourself further into the situation, and then let me know what you find.How will I contact you?You wont.Ill contact you.So after that, feeling deeply uneasy, Kiran kept his eye out when they were making the Vinmara run.It became clearer than ever to him that the transport crew was not intended to know the contents of their rovers; there were guards on every run, and the office in central Vinmara was as closed to outsiders as the various facilities in Cleopatra.The rovers backed up to a loading dock and interfaced with the building, and after a while drove away, and that was it.Once, when an exceptionally deep snowfall delayed them mid route, Kiran listened without watching as the guard in their cab had a phone conversation that seemed to be with people in the storage compartment of the rover; they spoke Chinese, and later Kiran had his translation spectacles translate the recording it had made:  Are you okay back there?Were fine.Theyre fine.They?Anyway, it was something to tell Shukra, if he reappeared.As it happened, they were down in Vinmara when the big blizzard finally stopped.The skies cleared; the stars in all their glory punctured the black dome of the sky.Naturally they joined the whole town in suiting up and going out the city gates onto the bare hills above the town.The continuous deluge of snow and sleet and hail and rain had gone on for three years and three months.Now everyone wanted to see what things looked like under the stars.Almost all the landscape they could see was covered by snow, gleaming in the starlight.Many spiky points of black rock broke through this gleaming whitethe land surrounding the town must have been a devils golf course of aa or something like itand the result was that over their heads the black sky spangled with brilliant stars, while under their feet the white hills were spattered by spiky black outcroppings, so that the two together looked like photographic negatives of each other.And now they could breathe the open air.It was screamingly cold, of course, so as people pulled off their helmets they did scream, casting brief plumes of frost from their open mouths.Breathable aira nitrogen argon oxygen mix, at seven hundred millibars, and ten degrees below.It was like breathing vodka.The snow underfoot was too hard to dig out snowballs, and people were falling as they skidded this way and that.Out on the hilltop above the town they could see for huge distances in all directions.It was around noon, and among the stars overhead hung the black circle of the eclipsed sun.A black cutout in the skythe sunshield, letting through no sunlightexcept for today, when there was a scheduled uneclipse.These uneclipses had been happening once a month for a while now, to help heat things back up to a more human friendly level, but no one on the planet had been able to see them because the rain and snow had blocked the view.Now there would be one they would be able to see.Many people were putting their helmets back on; the reality of the cold was setting in.Kirans nose was numb, while his ears were still burning as they froze.People said you could break frozen ears right off, and now he believed it.Music was playing from loudspeakers down in the town, something clangorous with cymbals and bells, very Slavic, very violent and loud.Then directly overhead the sunshield was suddenly marked by a perfectly circular thread of diamond light, blazing near the edge of the black disk.Though this annular ring was a mere wire of brilliant yellow, a delicate hoop of fire, it still lit up the white hills and the scalloped town, and the silver sea to the south, and the plumes of frost pouring from their cheering throats, all glowing now with a bronze light that brought back memories of all the sunniness they had ever known or dreamed of.The burnished tinge was like the light of life itself, a light they had almost forgot, all brought back now by the yellow air.After a frigid hour the ring of fire grew thinner and thinner, eclipsing from its inside out, until the disk of the sun became completely black again.The circular venetian blind had closed its opened slat.The snowy land darkened to its usual pale luminosity; the stars grew big again.Full night was back, in all its grim familiarity.Just above the black disk of the sun a bright white planet gleamed, small but steady: Mercury, Kiran was told.They were seeing Mercury from Venus, and it gleamed like a pearl made of diamond.And there over the western horizon hung Earth and Luna too, a double star with a blue tinge.Wow, Kiran said; something in him seemed to be blowing up like a balloon.Had to breathe deep or he might pop.But his teammates were tugging at his arm.Earth boy!Earth boy!Bye bye miss America pie!We must get back in town fast, theres a rover broken down, Lakshmi want us right now!Lead on!Kiran cried, and followed them back down the hillside to the open gates of Vinmara.Just inside the city gate they followed phone instructions to the rover that was in distress.It looked exactly like their own.The driver and a trio of security people were standing by it, very unhappy; the rover had lost all power, and some packages needed to be run over to the office in the town center as quickly and discreetly as possible.Kiran stood in a short line with his teammates and took a big flat box passed down from one of the security people, thinking that this might be his opportunity to find out what was being transported.Then they were off across town in a little line, like porters.The town was almost empty, its residents still out on the hill celebrating.The box Kiran was carrying weighed about five kilos; it was not exceptionally heavy for its size.There was a keypad lock on it, near the hasp, that made it look like a reinforced briefcase.They were not far from the office.The actual hinges of the case looked little and flimsy, and he wondered what would happen if he accidentally dropped it on its hinge side.But then the security trio from the disabled rover appeared, crying, Run!Run!Get to the office now!looking over their shoulders fearfully with their guns drawn.Everyone bolted, and Kiran, following the others, seeing they were rattled, shifted the briefcase in his hands so that its hinges were out to his side.When his mates turned a corner to run down a narrow alley, he pretended to trip, and slammed the case hard into the corner of a wall, right against the hinges.The case held solid.Oh shit!Did you break them?someone exclaimed from behind himone of the security guardsa Chinese tall, standing over him now, looking horrified.What, are they eggs?Kiran asked as he got up.Like eggs, the guard said, taking the box up and punching away at its keypad.And if theyre broken, we better leave town.The top of the box lifted, and there in individual clear containers lay a dozen human eyeballsall of them, by coincidence, Kiran assumed, staring right at him.Extracts (14)  The space project accelerated as it was becoming clear that Earth was in for a terrible time because of the climate change and general despoliation of the biosphere.Going into space looked like an attempt to escape all that, and there was enough truth in this that defenders of the space project always had to emphasize its humanitarian and environmental value, the ways in which the resources available in the solar system might help Earth limp through its stupendous overshoot.Inhabiting the other bodies of the solar system could be said to conform to the Leopoldian land ethic, whats good is whats good for the land, because it was going to take stuff from space to save Earth  first settlements on Luna, Mars, and the asteroids were so expensive that they were made as international or national projects, using public money.This made them pitifully weak through the years of dithering, but following the construction of the first space elevators, they blossomed, and by the time of the Accelerando they were ready to take center stageready to be the landscape of the Accelerando  Mars was the first to be terraformed, and compared to those that followed, it was very easy.Early on the decision was made to proceed as quickly as possible.Thousands of explosions were set off in the regolith (it was said this would help the Martian life forms buried in the lithosphere), and much of the surface of the planet was burned, in lines that later served as beds for the planets famous canals.The burning created an atmosphere, and the planets ice was mined and melted such that a narrow northern ocean and a Hellas Sea were filled.Little to no regard was taken for the primordial surface, and yet it was also true that the vertical scale of the planets topography protected the highest parts of the landscape from much alteration, leaving it as a kind of primeval park  a mass influx of immigrants from Earth quickly melded into a polyglot community that within two generations thought of itself as intrinsically and fundamentally Martian, Homo ares, and as such, a political unit independent of Earth by nature and by right.The entire population agreed to secede from all Terran associations, afterward reorganizing under a new constitution that stipulated a single planetary government and an economic system variously labeled socialist, communist, utopian, democratic state anarchic, syndicalist, worker cooperative, libertarian socialist, and any number of other labels from the past, all of which were rejected by Martian political theorists, who preferred the adjective martian or areological.As a new socioeconomic system with a newly created biosphere to work in, Mars was a socio physical power the equal of any single Earth nation or alliance and in many ways, because of its unity, the equal of all the rest of balkanized humanity combined  fears were stoked when Mars in the first flush of independence began to strip the nitrogen from Titans atmosphere for return to Mars, without regard for the opinions of the people already in the Saturn system, admittedly few in number.Around this same time (21762196), Chinese teams dismantled Saturns moon Dione in order to redirect it to Venus as part of the initial terraformation there.In the disruption on Earth following the Little Ice Age of the 2140s, there was no power on Earth large enough to challenge the Chinese over this distant move.But these two events around Saturn together stimulated the creation of the Saturn League, which over time managed to assert sovereignty over the whole Saturn systemalthough it is true that the threat of a traumatic Saturn Mars war, Saturns phantom war of independence, as some called itwas needed to finalize the assertion  Earths moon, Luna, never achieved independence, but was always divided into cities and regions controlled by various Terran powers.It would have been difficult to fully terraform Luna in any case, because hitting it with asteroids to spin it and give it an atmosphere was considered too likely to subject Earth to a tektite rain of potentially great severity.It was also true that metals and useful chemicals in lunar rock could be mined only by a deep strip mining and processing of much of the lunar surface, which also made terraforming difficult.So large domed craters and tented areas alternated with cosmologically large mining pits, and each nation with a substantial lunar presence had an influx of raw materials.Chinas early investment on Luna led directly to its influence over Venus, because the Venus sunshield was a product of the lunar Chinese industrial bases.At the same time many other Terran nations established lunar bases, and the political unification of Luna became impossible.Some locate the origins of the Balkanization to this development, although most see qubical decoherence and the sheer size of the solar system as the key  balkanization is of course the subject of great disagreement, with judgments of it ranging from its being the newly lowest circle of hell to its representing the delectable and fructifying diversification of life in our time  success is failure.The Accelerando spread all the weakness, disease, and crime embedded in the Terran system of that era, and once spread that widely, they could never be contained.Pandoras box had been  by the beginning of the twenty fourth century the Mondragon Accord had organized a third force to join the Earth Mars dyad, and the Jovian and Saturnian leagues provided major counterweights as well.A situation of this much diplomatic complexity brought back talk of a balance of powers, of the great game, of a cold war, and so on: all ideas from earlier eras, again haunting us as they have a wont to do, hungry ghosts deceiving us with their false analogies, laying their dead hands on our living eyes!Ultimately the Balkanization was by its scope and special nature a new thing  It was rumored in these years that Martian spies were everywhere in the system, but that they were constantly reporting back to headquarters that there was nothing to fearbalkanization meant Mars faced nothing but a stochastic chaos of human flailing      WAHRAM ON EARTH  That he would alter his plans, not to say change his life, all to help and please a person he did not know very well or trust very much, someone who was often angry at him and just as likely to punch his chest as smile at him; someone who might give him the evil eye at any time, might snarl at him contemptuously, so that really all his efforts to please her could be labeled a form of cowardice rather than affectionthis surprised him.And yet it was turning out to be the case.He had already spent the greater part of the previous year traveling all over the system, rallying diplomatic and material support for Alexs plans to revivify Earth and to deal with the qube problem; now added to this campaign, he spent a lot of time thinking about ways to implement Swans notion of rapidly improving conditions for the Terran forgotten ones.Whether Swan was aware of his efforts he doubted, but he felt she could find out if she wanted to, as his life was an open book, except for the parts he was hiding from her.He certainly wasnt going to tell her what he had done.It seemed to him that the intensity of her engagement with him at their last crossingbeating on him and yelling at himmeant she had been paying attention, and would continue to.And actions were what mattered.The nature of this new work was terribly hard on his pseudoiterative mode, which became so much more pseudo than iterative that it tipped over into the flux of sheer exfoliation, every day different and no patterns possible.This was hard for him, and as day followed day, then week week, and month month, he began to wonder, not why he was doing what he was doing, but why Swan was not contacting him to join forces.They would have accomplished more working as a team.Combining the powers of the innermost and outermost societies in the solar system would have some good effects, and it would seem therefore that Mercury and Saturn should be natural partners and, if they were, become a force almost the equal of the big bangers in the middle.Wahram could see several potential leverages.But she had not called or sent any messages.So he continued to work.In some countries their campaign was called Rapid Noncompliance AlleviationRNA.The noncompliance was with the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights, and the infractions involved many articles of that document, but most often articles 17, 23, and 25, with 28 occasionally waved about as a reminder to recalcitrant governments.In other countries their programs were based on a venerable Indian government office, the Society for the Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP).This organization had never gotten much traction in its stated goal, but it was an already existing agency, and these had been identified by the Mondragon as the best of the bad options for channeling assistance.Wahram had thought it generally agreed that the whole development aid model had been demonstrated to be an example of the Jevons Paradox, in which increases in efficiency trigger more consumption rather than less; increased aid had always somehow increased suffering, in some kind of feedback loop, poorly theorizedor else theorized perfectly well, but in such a way that revealed the entire system to be a case of vampiric rich people moving around the Earth performing a complicated kleptoparasitism on the poor.No one wanted to hear that news, so they kept on repeating errors identified four hundred years before, on ever grander scales.So, the Planet of Sadness.There were of course very powerful forces on Earth adamantly opposed to tinkering from above in general, and to creating full employment in particular.Full employment, if enacted, would remove wage pressurewhich phrase had always meant fear struck into the hearts of the poor, also into the hearts of anyone who feared becoming poor, which meant almost everyone on Earth.This fear was a major tool of social control, indeed the prop that held up the current order despite its obvious failures.Even though it was a system so bad that everyone in it lived in fear, either of starvation or the guillotine, still they clutched to it harder than ever.It was painful to witness.Nevertheless, the immiserated were ready to try anything.So something ought to be possible.So Wahram crisscrossed the Old World like a modern day Ibn Battuta, talking to government agencies in a position to do something.This was awkward work that took a real diplomatic touch to avoid being offensive in various ways.It was interesting.But he heard nothing from Swan.And Earth was big.There were 457 countries, and many associations of countries, and units within countries with significant power.Wahram was not going to run into Swan just because she also was at work on Earth.So he looked her up.Apparently she was working near North Harare, a small country carved out of what had been Zimbabwe.He read about the place on the flight there.Zimbabwe, rich in resources; a particularly dismal postcolonial history; splintered into a dozen residual countries, many still mired in problems; the great droughts exacerbating the situation; lately a recent population spike, and thus more trouble.North Harare was a slum in the shape of a crescent moon.The other little countries around it were better off.He contacted Pauline and told her that he was coming to the area on RNA related business, and soon enough Pauline got back to him with a hello from Swan and a suggested meeting on the very evening of his arrival, which was reassuring but meant that he had to meet her oppressed by jet lag.He was almost quivering with fatigue, and felt as if he weighed two hundred kilograms, when Swan burst into the room and it was time to perk up.She gave him a nod and a quick appraisal.You look like youve had a long trip.Come on in and Ill make you some tea and you can tell me about it.She started the tea and then excused herself to deal with a visitor, talking in Chinese.Wahram tried hard to grasp what she was like now, vividly before him again.Still intense, that was clear.Over tea they shared the news.Certain space elevators were slapping tariffs on equipment coming down; others were completely denied to spacers, an absurd situation.People were calling the Quito elevator the Umbilical Cord.It looked like the elevator problem would be a bottleneck, but there was a plan afoot to send down self replicating factories from cislunar space, deployed in a single timed invasion of thousands of atmospheric landers.A wide variety of space to Earth landers were available, including some that split successively as they descended, until individual people or packages floated down in aerogel bubbles.Thats like the reverse of what hit Terminator, Swan said sourly.Instead of little bits convening to make a big mass, the big mass dissociates into parts.And when they land, things get built rather than destroyed.They might get shot down.There would be too many for that.I dont like the aggressive look of it, Wahram said.I thought we were trying to make it look like a charity thing.Charity is always aggressive, Swan said.Dont you know that?No, I dont think I do.It seemed clear to him that aggressive aid wasnt going to work.But Swan was not a patient person.Now she was trying to do diplomatic work in the way Alex would have; but Alex had had a genius for diplomacy, while Swan had none.And they were facing one of the longest standing problems in human history.The whole thing transcended their own opinions about it in any case, as it was a Mondragon effort, with the Venusians on board too.So all kinds of things were happening.News screens seemed to be transmitting news from ten Earths at once, all writhing in the same space.Earth meant people like gods and people like rats: and in a paroxysm of rage they were going to reach out and wreck everything, even the space worlds that kept them from starvation.In the big merry go round, Earth spun like a red horse with a bomb in it.And they could not get off the merry go round.Absentmindedly Wahram whistled under his breath the opening notes of Beethovens Pastoral Symphony, trying to cheer her up.But she pursed her lips to make a little frown.Still, he had reminded her of the tunnel.Many spacers were scared to go to sub Saharan Africa, because the disease vector loads there were so much higher than in most space habitats.Wahram supposed that Swan had gone to Africa partly in defiance of that kind of caution; she would be one to believe in hormesis if anyone would, given her ingestion of the Enceladan aliens.So here she was in Nyabira, directing the deployment of self replicating construction sheds.They planned to start by reconstructing the part of Harare called Domboshawa, transforming its northernmost ring of shantytowns into garden city versions of themselves.This refurbishing of the built infrastructure was not a complete solution, but the selfreps did build wells, health centers, schools, clothing factories, and housing in several styles already used in Domboshawa, including aspects of the traditional local rondavels.The selfreps were nearly autonomous, and with proper programming, sufficient materials feed, and good troubleshooting, they rolled over evacuated portions of the shantytowns like enormous blimp hangars, leaving behind a new strip of buildings, whitewashed and impressively practical and homey.As the gigantic barns slowly grumbled over targeted neighborhoods, the hopeful residents cheered them on.That the barns themselves grew longer and longer in the process and finally split into two units went almost unremarked upon.It was an excellent tech and had built many a fine city state in the asteroid belt and on the big moons of Jupiter.It had been a crucial component of the Accelerando, in fact.But on Earth it wasnt working out.The transformations involved were too great; there grew furious objections, often from elsewhere than the areas being renovated.Only if residents voted for the project by a very large majority would it happen in something close to concord, and it was best when they themselves were programming the selfrep AIs.Then a selfrep in Uttar Pradesh was blown up; no one knew why.The state government that should have investigated refused to do so, and there were signs that they might even have supported the attack.News of the attack created copycat crimes; it would take only a few more to make the project collapse worldwide.This made Swan furious.They attacked us when we didnt help, and now when we do, she said bitterly.Wahram, feeling uneasy as he watched her get more and more tightly wound, said, Even so, we must persevere.It was happening all over Earth, Wahram saw on the screens; their restoration projects were getting tangled in dense networks of law and practice and landscape, and the occasional sabotage or accident didnt help.One couldnt change anything on Earth without several different kinds of mess resulting, some of them paralyzing.Every square meter of the Earths land was owned in several different ways.In space it was different.On Venus if a single roomful of planners agreed, then you could blast most of the atmosphere into space.On Titan it was similar, around Jupiter the same; throughout the solar system massive terraforming projects were proceeding.Excavate ocean beds, change out atmospheres, heat up or chill things by hundreds of K But not on Earth.In many places the selfreps were forbidden, even reviled.No matter what they did, it seemed that the misery of the forgotten ones would keep pulling civilization down, like an anchor they had tied around their own neck.Terran elites would stay on top of an artificial Great Chain of Being until it snapped and everyone fell into the void.A pathetic Gtterdmmerung, stupid and banal, and yet still horrible.The prospect of that was making Swan angry.Wahram, more and more aware of her bitterness, more and more the target of her anger, watched her one morning abuse one of the Harare women who helped run their operationsaw the womans face as she was chastisedrealized that if he stayed, he was going to end up crossing Swan in some catastrophic way, or simply not liking her.So that afternoon he excused himself, and the next day flew to America to join a Saturnian crew, newly arrived to help raise Florida back above the sea.On the day he left, Swan, distracted by some vexing problem of the moment, only waved him away like a mosquito.Florida had been an unusually lowlying peninsula, it turned out, with only a thin spine down the center of the state higher than the eleven meter rise of the oceans.One could still see the state in outline from the air, as a dark reef under a shallow sea, a reef that still bled yellow into the slightly deeper waters around it.The skyscrapers of the Miami corridor had been occupied, like those in Manhattan and elsewhere, but by and large the state had had to be abandoned.However, as most of its soil was still there, topping the reef as a layer of mud that was not particularly damaged by inundation, the opportunity existed to scoop it up, then raise the rock foundation of the peninsula with rock trained down from the Canadian Rockies, and after that put the soil back in place on top of the newly raised bedrock platform.In other words, it was like Greenland: one of the few places on Earth where terraforming could be performed without too much collateral damage.Naturally there were defendants of the new reefs and fishing grounds to protest, but they had been mollified or steamrolled, and the project approved in Atlanta and Washington, D. C. , which itself existed in a polder behind a giant system of barrier dams on the Potomac.Washingtons vestigial but still powerful government, now itself located largely below sea level, was sympathetic to the idea of raising Florida from the drowned.It was one of the ten biggest microterraforming projects currently being performed on Earth, and Wahram was happy to join his Saturnian colleagues, who were part of a work unit put together by an Alabama Amsterdam cooperative venture.Teams in Alaska, British Columbia, the Yukon, and Nunavut were excavating the interiors of mountain ranges, creating galleries down in the bedrock, which were then being filled with frozen carbon dioxide they had elsewhere sucked out of the atmosphere.Whether all this could be done in a manner that was geologically and environmentally stable, Wahram doubted.It was a prodigious amount of rock, for one thing; Florida was on average five meters underwater, and they wanted to build it up slightly higher than it had been originally, in case Greenland or East Antarctica also gave their ice to the sea.Using the narrow finger of a peninsula that was the states only remaining land as their causeway, they were moving the segmented mountain interiors on trains and building the state as they had built rock jetties in older times.The Everglades were to be plumbed to function at the new higher elevation; newly generated analogs of the many extinct species of birds and animals that had graced the peninsula before European immigration were to be introduced.They were going to recreate Florida.Enough carbon dioxide was to be buried under the northern Rockies to make the project on balance carbon negative.The building and transport crews for the job were hired primarily from the Suffering South, as it had been called in the years when the West Antarctic Ice Sheet had come off and sea level made its biggest rise.The Florida work did not create full employment by itself, but riding the rails, Wahram had a lot of time to look at the passing country and think about it, and once he sent a note to Swan: Remember what you said on Venus about giving everyone here a job doing landscape restoration?It could work.So he rode the trains back and forth from Canada to Florida.The land was huge, and mostly flat.Heat had parched land that had once grown wheat without irrigation, so they had changed crops and started irrigating, but large regions in Manitoba and the Dakotas had reverted to high desert.Now people were saying the prairies had always been high desert.They were becoming home to buffalo again.On the other hand, the forests flanking the Mississippi were back, more subtropical than ever.Missouri and Arkansas looked like South America.There were long hours when he could stand between cars, protected from the wind of their passage, and look at the big land.Landscapers and gardeners, animal handlers and vets, environmental engineers and designers, heavy equipment operators, porters and diggersall were essential in the work of making a landscape.The giant waldos, the selfrep hangars, they were only good for certain things.Local people working their land was a better image than selfreps dropping out of the sky.The people he talked to were more accepting of the Florida project, and the relevant governments also.Not a few people were enthusiastic to an almost religious degree.To have their drowned land hauled back out of the water was their dream.Rebuilding the infrastructure here was a task without negative consequences, except for those who had been enjoying the new reefs, and they would be given new new reefs.Florida was going to end up like a big Venice, resting on pilings stuck deep into the Earth.Assisted migration would replant and reanimate the land as quickly as it was ready.On one train ride north, Wahram listened to one of the reef engineers explain that the corals they were replanting all released their eggs on the same night of the year, and even within the same twenty minutes, though they were scattered over hundreds of miles.Apparently they accomplished this by way of two color sensitive cells in each coral, which together were able to distinguish the particular blue of the twilight sky on the night after the first full moon following the spring equinox.This moon rose right after sunset, when the sky was still also lit by the recently departed sun, and this brief double illumination lit the sky to a particular shade of blue that the corals could recognize.I have to tell Swan about this, Wahram said, amazed at the thought of such brainless but living precision.Sentience, what was it?Meanwhile the Florida raising prospered.Wahram watched the people working in what he recognized as the euphoria of the project, which he had felt so strongly himself in his youth, building cities on Titan.There they had had to carve a world out of the ice; here they had to raise one out of the sea.But it was the same feeling.Once on a train going south he was out between cars with a Dutch woman he was working with, a blond firebrand, and going slow at one road crossing, they looked down at a group of young men who were throwing stones at the train cars and chanting, Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, and she leaned out and shouted, Hey, fuck you back!We are reconstructing the South!And you have to like it!With an evil Germanic laugh that hopefully they did not hear.Extracts (15)  the brain is labile and has been shown to accept introduced machines, stem cells, drugs, electrodes, brain cells from other species,  evolution conserves things that work.We have a conserved brain, with different ages for its different partsin effect lizard at back and bottom, mammal in the middle, human at the front and top.Lizard brain to breathe and sleep, mammal brain to form packs, human brain to think it over  over selecting for a single trait warps evolution, you can get a result called the bad becoming normal.As people have been speciating into self evolved post humans of various kinds, this result has been seen frequently, as in  parts of the brain fire at the sight of a picture of food, but not at food itself.People like to hunt.Hunting takes many forms.Hunt for a deal, hunt for meaning.A predators killing is calm and rewarding.Rage always feels bad, rage is a painful emotion.Without a catch, the predator may not be able to deactivate the hunt.Fear is a constraint on anger.Animals never unlearn a bad fear.And we are animals.Piloerection  pathological aggression: dolphins kill porpoises for no reason, they dont eat them, theyre not competitors.Does this suggest the uncanny valley exists for all mammals?reason cant work without emotion.People cut off from their emotions cant decide.Thus the decision to manipulate the brain with hormonal therapies has wide reaching consequences.Bisexual therapies alter brain levels of oxytocin, vasopressin, and their precursor vasotocin.An oxytocin nasal spray causes immediately better eye contact.Endorphins are natures version of morphine.The brain releases endorphins when injured, and when someone we love touches us.Thrill seekers calm a hurt  3 percent of mammals monogamous.Play teaches mammals how to handle surprises  five different brain areas evaluate melody, rhythm, meter, tonality, and timbre.Music was the first human language, and still is the language of animals and birds.Music predates humanity by 160 million years.The introduction of birdsong brain nodules to the appropriate human brain sites has resulted in aphasia, also temporal lobe phenomena like omnipresent sublimity, hypermusicality leading to hyperventilation (whistling or singing),  human vocal cords were already capable of purring and it needed only the insertion of feline amygdalan and hippocampal and hypothalamic cells to  performance in flight waldos is vastly improved by implantation of raptor or hummingbird flight nodules in human operators.The different structure of avian brains makes insertion into interstitial cells particularly  it is possible that orgasm already taxes the relevant systems as far as it can without damage such as hernias, broken ribs, thrombosis, and heart attacks.Passengers on sexliners who have taken vasotocin have been known to  The subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, or sgACC, is the place in the brain that directs the body to ignore fear.It is the place of courage, and stimulating it can help a person overcome the dread of phobias.It is possible to overstimulate it, after which  The temporal lobe is the site of feeling states such as the omnipresent sublime, hyperreligiosity, hypersexuality, hypergraphia, overinclusion mania, and so on.Intentional brain stimulation or alteration to promote any of these states can easily trigger the others, or cause epileptic  Human subjects (volunteers) who have ingested the Enceladan community, including the organism Enceladusea irwinii, reported synesthesia and individually heightened senses, sometimes confirmable by test.Heightened sensory impressions are often balanced by a reduced ability to generalize or calculate      Lists (12)  boredom, taedium vitae, the knowledge of maya, absurdity, weltschmerz, mal du siecle, existential nausea, dysphoria, doldrums, the funk, malaise, ennui, hebephrenia, discouragement, depression, melancholia, anomie, accidie, dysthymia, blankness, lack of affect, the blues, despair, the black dog, black ass, hopelessness, sorrow, grief, unhappiness, Hikikomori, alienation, withdrawal, tristitia, nihilism, morbidity, anhedonia, wretchedness, anxiety, fear, pain, terror, horror, desolation, postcentennial hypochondria, lterschmerz, thanatropism, fear of death, death wish      SWAN IN AFRICA  Swan was not enjoying the Earth project.She stuck it out because she believed in it and thought it was her best way to help; she thought it was what Alex would be doing, and so she couldnt abandon it just because it was hard, frustrating, stupid.She cursed the day she had ever left Terminator; she dreamed of the day when she could dance down the Great Staircase to the park and the farm.She got impatient so fast.Wahram would have been better for stuff like this, but he had flown off to America, frustrated like so many before him by irrefragable Africa.Swan wanted to be tougher than that, and was irritated with him.That added to her general irritation, and her patience often disappeared and left her seething.She became abrasive with people, thus even more ineffective.She woke wondering how many days she had left of this.Someone in the office repeated something Zasha had said, Earth itself is a development sink, and she shouted in his face.Another day she got into another shouting match with a woman from the African League, down visiting from Dar to make trouble, and to keep from striking her Swan had to just walk away, hustling down the crowded streets of the city, cursing in Chinese.
