A few hours, then a few more.The ship was under thrust, the prisoners actually sitting at the tables instead of floating near them.He flipped to other parts of the ship.Julies locker was still closed.If he hadnt known better, hed have assumed she was dead.He skipped ahead.One hundred and thirty two hours later, the crew of the Scopuli grew a pair.Miller saw it in their bodies even before the violence started.Hed seen holding cells rise up before, and the prisoners had the same sullen but excited look.The feed showed the stretch of wall where hed seen the bullet holes.They werent there yet.They would be.A man came into the picture with a tray of food rations.Here it comes, Miller thought.The fight was short and brutal.The prisoners didnt stand a chance.Miller watched as they hauled one of them a sandy haired man to the airlock and spaced him.The others were put in heavy restraints.Some wept.Some screamed.Miller skipped ahead.It had to be in there someplace.The moment when it whatever it was got loose.But either it had happened in some unmonitored crew quarters or it had been there from the beginning.Almost exactly one hundred and sixty hours after Julie had gone into the locker, a man in a white jumper, eyes glassy and stance unsure, lurched out of the crew quarters and vomited on one of the guards.Fuck!Amos shouted.Miller was out of his chair before he knew what had happened.Holden was up too.Amos?Holden said.Talk to me.Hold on, Amos said.Yeah, its okay, Capn.Its just these fuckers stripped off a bunch of the reactor shielding.Weve got her up, but I sucked down a few more rads than Id have picked.Get back to the Roci, Holden said.Miller steadied himself against a wall, pushing back down toward the control stations.No offense, sir, but it aint like Im about to start pissing blood or anything fun like that, Amos said.I got surprised more than anything.I start feeling itchy, Ill head back over, but I can get some atmosphere for us by working out of the machine shop if you give me a few more minutes.Miller watched Holdens face as the man struggled.He could make it an order; he could leave it be.Okay, Amos.But you start getting light headed or anything I mean anything and you get over to the sick bay.Aye, aye, Amos said.Alex, keep an eye on Amos biomed feed from over there.Give us a heads up if you see a problem, Holden said on the general channel.Roger, came Alexs lazy drawl.You finding anything?Holden asked Miller on their private channel.Nothing unexpected, Miller said.You?Yeah, actually.Take a look.Miller pushed himself to the screen Holden had been working.Holden pulled himself back into the station and started pulling up feeds.I was thinking that someone had to go last, Holden said.I mean, there had to be someone who was the least sick when whatever it was got loose.So I went through the directory to see what activity was going on before the system went dead.And?Theres a whole bunch of activity that looks like it happened a couple days before the system shutdown, and then nothing for two solid days.And then a little spike.A lot of accessed files and system diagnostics.Then someone hacked the override codes to blow atmosphere.It was Julie, then.Thats what I was thinking, Holden said.But one of the feeds she accessed was Shit, where is it?It was right Oh.Here.Watch this.The screen blinked, controls dropping to standby, and a high res emblem, green and gold, came up.The corporate logo of Protogen, with a slogan Miller hadnt seen before.First.Fastest.Furthest.Whats the time stamp on the file?Miller asked.The original was created about two years ago, Holden said.This copy was burned eight months ago.The emblem faded, and a pleasant faced man sitting at a desk took its place.He had dark hair, with just a scattering of gray at the temples, and lips that seemed used to smiling.He nodded at the camera.The smile didnt reach his eyes, which were as empty as a sharks.Sociopath, Miller thought.The mans lips began moving soundlessly.Holden said, Shit, and hit a switch to have the audio transmitted to their suits.He rewound the video feed and started it over.Mr.Dresden, the man said.I would like to thank you and the members of the board for taking the time to review this information.Your support, both financial and otherwise, has been absolutely essential to the incredible discoveries weve seen on this project.While my team has been point man, as it were, Protogens tireless commitment to the advancement of science has made our work possible.Gentlemen, I will be frank.The Phoebe protomolecule has exceeded all our expectations.I believe it represents a genuinely game changing technological breakthrough.I know that these kinds of corporate presentations are prone to hyperbole.Please understand that I have thought about this carefully and chosen my words: Protogen can become the most important and powerful entity in the history of the human race.But it will require initiative, ambition, and bold action.Hes talking about killing people, Miller said.Youve seen this already?Holden said.Miller shook his head.The feed changed.The man faded out, and an animation took his place.A graphic representation of the solar system.Orbits marked in wide swaths of color showed the plane of the ecliptic.The virtual camera swirled out from the inner planets, where Mr.Dresden and board members presumably were, and out toward the gas giants.For those of you on the board unfamiliar with the project, eight years ago, the first manned landing was made on Phoebe, the sociopath said.The animation zoomed in toward Saturn, rings and planet flying past in a triumph of graphic design over accuracy.A small ice moon, the assumption was that Phoebe would eventually be mined for water, much like the rings themselves.The Martian government commissioned a scientific survey more out of a sense of bureaucratic completeness than from expectation of economic gain.Core samples were taken, and when silicate anomalies raised flags, Protogen was approached as cosponsor of a long term research facility.The moon itself Phoebe filled the frame, turning slowly to show all sides like a prostitute at a cheap brothel.It was a crater marked lump, indistinguishable from a thousand other asteroids and planetesimals Miller had seen.Given Phoebes extra ecliptical orbit, the sociopath went on, one theory has been that it was a body that originated in the Kuiper belt and had been captured by Saturn when it happened to pass through the solar system.The existence of complex silicon structures within the interior ice, along with suggestions of impact resistant structures within the architecture of the body itself, have forced us to reevaluate this.Using analyses proprietary to Protogen and not yet shared with the Martian team, we have determined beyond any credible doubt that what you are seeing now is not a naturally formed planetesimal, but a weapon.Specifically, a weapon designed to carry its payload through the depths of interplanetary space and deliver it safely onto Earth two and one third billion years ago, when life itself was in its earliest stages.And the payload, gentlemen, is this.The display clicked to a graphic that Miller couldnt quite parse.It looked like the medical text of a virus, but with wide, looping structures that were at once beautiful and improbable.The protomolecule first caught our interest for its ability to maintain its primary structure in a wide variety of conditions through secondary and tertiary changes.It also showed an affinity for carbon and silicon structures.Its activity suggested it was not in itself a living thing, but a set of free floating instructions designed to adapt to and guide other replicating systems.Animal experiments suggest that its effects are not exclusive to simple replicators, but are, in fact, scalable.Animal tests, Miller said.What, they dumped it on a cat?The initial implication of this, the sociopath went on, is that a larger biosphere exists, of which our solar system is only a part, and that the protomolecule is an artifact of that environment.That alone, I think you must agree, would revolutionize human understanding of the universe.Let me assure you, its small beer.If accidents of orbital mechanics had not captured Phoebe, life as we know it would not presently exist.But something else would.The earliest cellular life on Earth would have been hijacked.Reprogrammed along lines contained within the structure of the protomolecule.The sociopath reappeared.For the first time, smile lines appeared around his eyes, like a parody of themselves.Miller felt a visceral hatred growing in his gut and knew himself well enough to recognize it for what it was.Fear.Protogen is in a position to take sole possession of not only the first technology of genuinely extraterrestrial origin, but also a prefabricated mechanism for the manipulation of living systems and the first clues as to the nature of the larger I will call it galactic biosphere.Directed by human hands, the applications of this are limitless.I believe that the opportunity now facing not only us but life itself is as profound and transformative as anything that has ever happened.And, further, the control of this technology will represent the base of all political and economic power from now on.I urge you to consider the technical details I have outlined in the attached.Moving quickly to understand the programming, mechanism, and intent of the protomolecule, as well as its direct application to human beings, will mark the difference between a Protogen led future and being left behind.I urge immediate and decisive action to take exclusive control of the protomolecule and move forward with large scale testing.Thank you for your time and attention.The sociopath smiled again, and the corporate logo reappeared.First.Fastest.Furthest.Millers heart was racing.Okay.All right, he said.And then: Fuck me.Protogen, protomolecule, Holden said.They had no idea what it does, but they slapped their label on it like theyd made it.They found an alien weapon, and all they could think to do was brand it.Theres reason to think these boys are pretty impressed with themselves, Miller replied with a nod.Now, Im not a scientist or anything, Holden said, but it seems to me like taking an alien supervirus and dropping it into a space station would be a bad idea.Its been two years, Miller said.Theyve been doing tests.Theyve been I dont know what the hell theyve been doing.But Eros is what they decided on.And everyone knows what happened on Eros.The other side did it.No research and recovery ships because theyre all fighting each other or guarding something.The war?Its a distraction.And Protogen is doing what?Seeing what their toy does when you take it out for a spin is my guess, Miller said.They were silent for a long moment.Holden spoke first.So you take a company that seems to be lacking an institutional conscience, that has enough government research contracts to almost be a privately run branch of the military.How far will they go for the holy grail?First, fastest, furthest, Miller replied.Yeah.Guys, Naomi said, you should come down here.I think Ive got something.Ive found the comm logs, Naomi said as Holden and Miller drifted into the room behind her.Holden put a hand on her shoulder, pulled it back, and hated that hed pulled back.A week earlier shed have been fine with a simple gesture of affection like that, and he wouldnt have been afraid of her reaction.He regretted the new distance between them only slightly less than he would have regretted not saying anything at all.He wanted to tell her that.Instead, he said, Find anything good?She tapped the screen and pulled up the log.They were hard core about comm discipline, she said, pointing at the long list of dates and times.Nothing ever went out on radio, everything was tightbeam.And everything was doublespeak, lots of obvious code phrases.Millers mouth moved inside his helmet.Holden tapped on his face shield.Miller rolled his eyes in disgust and then chinned the comm link to the general channel.Sorry.Dont spend a lot of time in suits, he said.Whatve we got thats good?Not much.But the last communication was in plain English, she said, then tapped the last line on the list.THOTH STATION   CREW DEGENERATING.PROJECTING 100% CASUALTIES.MATERIALS SECURED.STABILIZING COURSE AND SPEED.VECTOR DATA TO FOLLOW.EXTREME CONTAMINATION HAZARD FOR ENTRY TEAMS.CPT.HIGGINS   Holden read it several times, imagining Captain Higgins watching the infection spread through his crew, helpless to stop it.His people vomiting all over in a vacuum sealed metal box, even one molecule of the substance on your skin a virtual death sentence.Black filament covered tendrils erupting from their eyes and mouths.And then that soup that covered the reactor.He let himself shudder, grateful that Miller wouldnt see it through the atmosphere suit.So this Higgins fella realizes his crew is turning into vomit zombies and sends a last message to his bosses, right?Miller said, breaking into Holdens reverie.Whats this stuff about vector data?He knew theyd all be dead, so he was letting his people know how to catch the ship, Holden replied.But they didnt, because its here, because Julie took control and flew it somewhere else, Miller said.Which means theyre looking for it, right?Holden ignored that and put his hand back on Naomis shoulder with what he hoped was companionable casualness.We have tight beam messages and the vector info, he said.Are they all going to the same place?Sort of, she said, nodding with her right hand.Not the same place, but all to what appear to be points in the Belt.But based on the changes in direction and the times they were sent, to one point in the Belt that is moving around, and not in a stable orbit either.A ship, then?Naomi gave another nod.Probably, she said.Ive been playing with the locations, and I cant find anything in the registry that looks likely.No stations or inhabited rocks.A ship would make sense.But   Holden waited for Naomi to finish, but Miller leaned forward impatiently.But what?he said.But how did they know where it would be?she replied.I have no incoming comms in the log.If a ship was moving around randomly in the Belt, howd they know where to send these messages?Holden squeezed her shoulder, lightly enough that she probably didnt even feel it in the heavy environment suit, then pushed off and allowed himself to drift toward the ceiling.So its not random, he said.They had some sort of map of where this thing would be at the time they sent the laser comms.Could be one of their stealth ships.Naomi turned around in her chair to look up at him.Could be a station, she said.Its the lab, Miller broke in.Theyre running an experiment on Eros, they need the white coats nearby.Naomi, Holden said.Materials secured.Theres a safe in the captains quarters thats still locked down.Think you can get it open?Naomi gave a one handed shrug.I dont know, she said.Maybe.Amos could probably blast it open with some of the explosives we found in that big box of weapons.Holden laughed.Well, he said.Since its probably full of little vials of nasty alien viruses, Im going to nix the blasting option.Naomi shut down the comm log and pulled up a general ships systems menu.I can look around and see if the computer has access to the safe, she said.Try to open it that way.It might take some time.Do what you can, Holden said.Well get out of your hair.Holden pushed himself off the ceiling and over to the ops compartment hatch, then pulled himself through, into the corridor beyond.A few moments later, Miller followed.The detective planted his feet on the deck with magnetic boots, then stared at Holden, waiting.Holden floated down to the deck next to him.What do you think?Holden asked.Protogen being the whole thing?Or is this another one where it looks like them, so it isnt?Miller was silent for the space of two long breaths.This one smells like the real thing, Miller said.He sounded almost grudging.Amos pulled himself up the crew ladder from below, dragging a large metal case behind him.Hey, Capn, he said.I found a whole case of fuel pellets for the reactor in the machine shop.Well probably want to take these with us.Good work, Holden said, holding up one hand to let Miller know to wait.Go ahead and take those across.Also, I need you to work up a plan for scuttling this ship.Wait, what?Amos said.This thing is worth a jillion bucks, Captain.Stealth missile ship?The OPA would sell their grandmothers for this thing.And six of those tubes still have fish in them.Capital ship busters.You could slag a small moon with those.Forget their grannies, the OPA would pimp their daughters for that gear.Why the fuck would we blow it up?Holden stared at him in disbelief.Did you forget whats in the engine room?he asked.Hell, Cap, Amos snorted.That shit is all frozen.Couple hours with a torch and I can chop it up and chuck it out the airlock.Good to go.The mental image of Amos hacking the melted bodies of the ships former crew apart with a plasma torch and then cheerfully hurling the chunks out an airlock tipped Holden over the edge into full fledged nausea.The big mechanics ability just to ignore anything that he didnt want to notice probably came in handy while he was crawling around in tight and greasy engine compartments.His ability to shrug off the horrible mutilation of several dozen people threatened to change Holdens disgust into anger.Forgetting the mess, he said, and the very real possibility of infection by what made that mess, there is also the fact that someone is desperately searching for this very expensive and very stealthy ship, and so far Alex cant find the ship thats looking.He stopped talking and nodded at Amos while the mechanic mulled that over.He could see Amos broad face working as he put it together in his head.Found a stealth ship.Other people looking for stealth ship.We cant see the other people looking for it.Shit.Amos face went pale.Right, he said.Ill set the reactor up to slag her.He looked down at the time on his suits forearm display.Shit, weve been here too long.Better get the lead out.Better had, Miller agreed.* * *   Naomi was good.Very good.Holden had discovered this when hed signed on with the Canterbury, and over the course of years, hed added it to his list of facts, along with space is cold and the direction of gravity is down.When something stopped working on the water hauler, hed tell Naomi to fix it, and then never think of it again.Sometimes shed claim not to be able to fix something, but it was always a negotiating tactic.A short conversation would lead to a request for spare parts or an additional crewman hired on at the next port, and that would be that.There was no problem that involved electronics or spaceship parts she couldnt solve.I cant open the safe, she said.She floated next to the safe in the captains quarters, one foot resting lightly on his bunk to stabilize herself as she gestured.Holden stood on the floor with his boot mags on.Miller was in the hatchway to the corridor.What would you need?Holden asked.If you wont let me blast it or cut it, I cant open it.Holden shook his head, but Naomi either didnt see it or ignored him.The safe is designed to open when a very specific pattern of magnetic fields is played across that metal plate on the front, she said.Someone has a key designed to do that, but that key isnt on this ship.Its at that station, Miller said.He wouldnt send it there if they couldnt open it.Holden stared at the wall safe for a moment, his fingers tapping on the bulkhead beside it.Whatre the chances cutting it sets off a booby trap?he said.Fucking excellent, Cap, Amos said.He was listening in from the torpedo bay as he hacked the small fusion reactor that powered one of the six remaining torpedoes to go critical.Working on the ships main reactor was too dangerous with the shielding stripped off.Naomi, I really want that safe and the research notes and samples it contains, Holden said.You dont know thats whats in there, Miller said, then laughed.No, of course thats whats in there.But it wont help us if we get blown up or, worse, if some piece of goo coated shrapnel makes a hole in our nice suits.Im taking it, Holden replied, then pulled a piece of chalk from his suits pocket and drew a line around the safe on the bulkhead.Naomi, cut a small hole in the bulkhead and see if theres anything that would stop us from just cutting the whole damned thing out and taking it with us.Wed have to take out half the wall.Okay.Naomi frowned, then shrugged, then smiled and nodded with one hand.All right, then, she said.Thinking of taking it to Freds people?Miller laughed again, a dry humorless rasp that made Holden uneasy.The detective had been watching the video of Julie Maos fight with her captors over and over again while theyd waited on Naomi and Amos to finish their work.It gave Holden the disquieting feeling that Miller was storing the footage in his head.Fuel for something he planned to do later.Mars would give you your lives back in exchange for this, Miller said.I hear Mars is nice if youre rich.Fuck rich, Amos said with a grunt as he worked on something below.Theyd build statues of us.We have an agreement with Fred to let him outbid any other contracts we take, Holden said.Of course, this isnt really a contract per se   Naomi smiled and winked at Holden.So what is it, sir?she said, her voice faintly mocking.OPA heroes?Martian billionaires?Start your own biotech firm?What are we doing here?Holden pushed away from the safe and kicked out toward the airlock and the cutting torch that waited there with their other tools.I dont know yet, he said.But it sure feels nice to have choices again.* * *   Amos pushed the button again.No new stars flared in the dark.The radiation and infrared sensors remained quiet.Theres supposed to be an explosion, right?Holden asked.Fuck, yes, Amos said, then pushed the button on the black box in his hand a third time.This isnt an exact science or anything.Those missile drives are as simple as it gets.Just a reactor with one wall missing.Cant exactly predict   It isnt rocket science, Holden said with a laugh.What?Amos asked, ready to be angry if he was being mocked.You know, it isnt rocket science,  Holden said.Like it isnt hard.Youre a rocket scientist, Amos.For real.You work on fusion reactors and starship drives for a living.Couple hundred years ago, people would have been lining up to give you their children for what you know.What the fu  Amos started, but stopped when a new sun flared outside the cockpit window, then faded quickly.See?Fucking told you it would work.Never doubted it, Holden said, then slapped Amos on one meaty shoulder and headed aft down the crew ladder.What the fuck was that about?Amos asked no one in particular as Holden drifted away.He headed through the ops deck.Naomis chair was empty.Hed ordered her to get some sleep.Strapped down to loops inset in the deck was the stealth ships safe.It looked bigger cut out of the wall.Black and imposingly solid.The kind of container in which one kept the end of the solar system.Holden floated over to it and quietly said, Open sesame.The safe ignored him, but the deck hatch opened and Miller pulled himself up into the compartment.His environment suit had been traded in for a stale smelling blue jumpsuit and his ever present hat.There was something about the look on his face that made Holden uncomfortable.Even more so than the detective usually made him.Hey, Holden said.Miller just nodded and pulled himself over to one of the workstations, then buckled in to one of the chairs.We decided on a destination yet?he asked.No.Im having Alex run the numbers on a couple of possibilities, but I havent made up my mind.Been watching the news at all?the detective asked.Holden shook his head, then moved over to a chair on the other side of the compartment.Something in Millers face was chilling his blood.No, he said.What happened?You dont hedge, Holden.I admire that about you, I guess.Just tell me, Holden said.No, I mean it.A lot of people claim to believe in things.Family is most important, but theyll screw a fifty dollar hooker on payday.Country first, but they cheat on their taxes.Not you, though.You say everyone should know everything, and by God, you put your money where your mouth is.Miller waited for him to say something, but Holden didnt know what.This speech had the feel of something the detective had prepared ahead of time.Might as well let him finish it.So Mars finds out that maybe Earths been building ships on the side, ones with no flag on them.Some of them might have killed a Martian flagship.I bet Mars calls up to check.I mean, its the Earth Mars Coalition Navy, one big happy hegemony.Been policing the solar system together for almost a hundred years.Commanding officers are practically sleeping together.So it must be a mistake, right?Okay, Holden said, waiting.So Mars calls, Miller said.I mean, I dont know for sure, but I bet thats how it starts.A call from some bigwig on Mars to some bigwig on Earth.Seems reasonable, Holden said.What dyou think Earth says back?I dont know.Miller reached over and flipped on one of the screens, then pulled up a file with his name on it, date stamped from less than an hour before.A recording of video from a Martian news source, showing the night sky through a Martian dome.Streaks and flashes fill the sky.The ticker across the bottom of the feed says that Earth ships in orbit around Mars suddenly and without warning fired on their Martian counterparts.The streaks in the sky are missiles.The flashes are ships dying.And then a massive white flare turns the Martian night into day for a few seconds, and the crawl says that the Deimos deep radar station has been destroyed.Holden sat and watched the video display the end of the solar system in vivid color and with expert commentary.He kept waiting for the streaks of light to begin descending on the planet itself, for the domes to fly apart in nuclear fire, but it seemed someone had kept some measure of restraint, and the battle remained in the sky.It couldnt stay that way forever.Youre telling me that I did this, Holden said.That if I hadnt broadcast that data, those ships would still be alive.Those people.That, yeah.And that if the bad guys wanted to keep people from watching Eros, it just worked.The war stories flowed in.Miller watched the feeds five at a time, subscreens crowding the face of his terminal.Mars was shocked, amazed, reeling.The war between Mars and the Belt the biggest, most dangerous conflict in the history of mankind was suddenly a sideshow.The reactions of the talking heads of Earth security forces ran the gamut from calm, rational discussion of preemptive defense to foaming at the mouth denunciations of Mars as a pack of baby raping animals.The attack on Deimos had turned the moon into a slowly spreading ring of gravel in the moons old orbit, a smudge on the Martian sky, and with that, the game had changed again.Miller watched for ten hours as the attack became the blockade.The Martian navy, spread throughout the system, was turning home under heavy burn.The OPA feeds were calling it a victory, and maybe someone thought that was true.The pictures came through from the ships, from the sensor arrays.Dead warships, their sides ripped open by high energy explosions, spinning out into their irregular orbital graves.Medical bays like the Rocis filled with boys and girls half his age bleeding, burning, dying.Each cycle, new footage came in, new details of death and carnage.And each time some new clip appeared, he sat forward, hand on his mouth, waiting for the word to come.The one event that would signal the end of it all.But it hadnt come yet, and every hour that didnt bring it gave another sliver of hope that maybe, maybe it wasnt going to happen.Hey, Amos said.You slept at all?Miller looked up, his neck stiff.Red creases of his pillow still on his cheek and forehead, the mechanic stood in the open doorway of Millers cabin.What?Miller said.Then: Yeah, no.Ive been watching.Anyone drop a rock?Not yet.Its all still orbital or higher.What kind of half assed apocalypse are they running down there?Amos said.Give em a break.Its their first.The mechanic shook his broad head, but Miller could see the relief under the feigned disgust.As long as the domes were still standing on Mars, as long as the critical biosphere of Earth wasnt in direct threat, humanity wasnt dead.Miller had to wonder what they were hoping for out in the Belt, whether theyd managed to talk themselves into believing that the rough ecological pockets of the asteroids would sustain life indefinitely.You want a beer?Amos asked.Youre having beer for breakfast?Figure its dinner for you, Amos said.The man was right.Miller needed sleep.He hadnt managed more than a catnap since theyd scuttled the stealth ship, and that had been plagued by strange dreams.He yawned at the thought of yawning, but the tension in his gut said he was more likely to spend the day watching newsfeeds than resting.Its probably breakfast again, Miller said.Want some beer for breakfast?Amos asked.Sure.Walking through the Rocinante felt surreal.The quiet hum of the air recyclers, the softness of the air.The journey out to Julies ship was a haze of pain medication and sickness.The time on Eros before that was a nightmare that wouldnt fade.To walk through the spare, functional corridors, thrust gravity holding him gently to the floor, with very little chance of anyone trying to kill him felt suspicious.When he imagined Julie walking with him, it wasnt so bad.As he ate, his terminal chimed, the automatic reminder for another blood flush.He stood, adjusted his hat, and headed off to let the needles and pressure injectors do their worst.The captain was already there and hooked into a station when Miller arrived.Holden looked like hed slept, but not well.There werent the bruise dark marks under his eyes that Miller had, but his shoulders were tense, his brow on the edge of furrowed.Miller wondered whether hed been a little too hard on the guy.I told you so could be an important message, but the burden of innocent death, of the chaos of a failing civilization might also be too much for one man to carry.Or maybe he was still mooning over Naomi.Holden raised the hand that wasnt encased in medical equipment.Morning, Miller said.Hey.Decided where were going yet?Not yet.Getting harder and harder to get to Mars, Miller said, easing himself into the familiar embrace of the medical station.If thats what youre aiming for, youd better do it soon.While theres still a Mars, you mean?For instance, Miller agreed.The needles snaked out on gently articulated armatures.Miller looked at the ceiling, trying not to tense up as the lines forced their way into his veins.There was a moments stinging, then a low, dull ache, and then numbness.The display above him announced the state of his body to doctors who were watching young soldiers die miles above Olympus Mons.Do you think theyd stop?Holden asked.I mean, Earth has got to be doing this because Protogen owns some generals or senators or something, right?Its all because they want to be the only ones who have this thing.If Mars has it too, Protogen doesnt have a reason to fight.Miller blinked.Before he could pick his answer Theyd try to annihilate Mars completely, or Its gone too far for that, or Exactly how naive are you, Captain?Holden went on.Screw it.Weve got the datafiles.Im going to broadcast them.Millers reply was as easy as reflex.No, you arent.Holden propped himself up, storm clouds in his expression.I appreciate that you might have a reasonable difference of opinion, he said, but this is still my ship.Youre a passenger.True, Miller said.But you have a hard time shooting people, and you are going to have to shoot me before you send that thing out.Im what?The new blood flowed into Millers system like a tickle of ice water crawling toward his heart.The medical monitors shifted to a new pattern, counting up the anomalous cells as they hit its filters.You are going to have to shoot me, Miller said, slowly this time.Twice now youve had the choice of whether or not to break the solar system, and both times youve screwed it up.I dont want to see you strike out.I think you may have an exaggerated idea of how much influence the second in command of a long distance water hauler actually has.Yes, theres a war.And yes, I was there when it started up.But the Belt has hated the inner planets since a long time before the Cant was attacked.Youve got the inner planets divided up too, Miller said.Holden tilted his head.Earth has always hated Mars, Holden said like he was reporting that water was wet.When I was in the navy, we ran projections for this.Battle plans if Earth and Mars ever really got into it.Earth loses.Unless they hit first, hit hard, and dont let up, Earth just plain loses.Maybe it was distance.Maybe it was a failure of imagination.Miller had never seen the inner planets as divided.Seriously?he asked.Theyre the colony, but they have all the best toys and everyone knows it, Holden said.Everything thats happening out there right now has been building up for a hundred years.If it hadnt been there to start with, this couldnt have happened.Thats your defense?Not my powder keg; I just brought the match?Im not making a defense, Holden said.His blood pressure and heart rate were spiking.Weve been through this, Miller said.So let me just ask, why is it you think this time will be different?The needles in Millers arm seemed to heat up almost to the point of being painful.He wondered if that was normal, if every blood flush he had was going to feel the same way.This time is different, Holden said.All the crap thats going on out there is what happens when you have imperfect information.Mars and the Belt wouldnt have been going after each other in the first place if theyd known what we know now.Earth and Mars wouldnt be shooting each other if everyone knew the fight was being engineered.The problem isnt that people know too much, its that they dont know enough.Something hissed and Miller felt a wave of chemical relaxation swim through him.He resented it, but there was no calling the drugs back.You cant just throw information at people, Miller said.You have to know what it means.What its going to do.There was a case back on Ceres.Little girl got killed.For the first eighteen hours, we were all sure Daddy did it.He was a felon.A drunk.He was the last one who saw her breathing.All the classic signs.Hour nineteen, we get a tip.Turned out Daddy owed a lot of money to one of the local syndicates.All of a sudden, things are more complicated.We have more suspects.Do you think if Id been broadcasting everything I knew, Daddy would still have been alive when the tip came?Or would someone have put it all together and done the obvious thing?Millers medical station chimed.Another new cancer.He ignored it.Holdens cycle was just finishing, the redness of his cheeks speaking as much to the fresh, healthy blood in his body as to his emotional state.Thats the same ethos they have, Holden said.Who?Protogen.You may be on different sides, but youre playing the same game.If everyone said what they knew, none of this would have happened.If the first lab tech on Phoebe who saw something weird had gotten on his system and said, Hey, everyone!Look, this is weird, none of this would have happened.Yeah, Miller said, because telling everyone theres an alien virus that wants to kill them all is a great way to maintain calm and order.Miller, Holden said.I dont mean to panic you, but theres an alien virus.And it wants to kill everyone.Miller shook his head and smiled like Holden had said something funny.So look, maybe I cant point a gun at you and make you do the right thing.But lemme ask you something.Okay?Fine, Holden said.Miller leaned back.The drugs were making his eyelids heavy.What happens?Miller said.There was a long pause.Another chime from the medical system.Another rush of cold through Millers abused veins.What happens?Holden repeated.It occurred to Miller he could have been more specific.He forced his eyes open again.You broadcast everything weve got.What happens?The war stops.People go after Protogen.Theres some holes in that, but let it go.What happens after that?Holden was quiet for a few heartbeats.People start going after the Phoebe bug, he said.They start experimenting.They start fighting for it.If that little bastards as valuable as Protogen thinks, you cant stop the war.All you can do now is change it.Holden frowned, angry lines at the corners of his mouth and eyes.Miller watched a little piece of the mans idealism die and was sorry that it gave him joy.So what happens if we get to Mars?Miller went on, his voice low.We trade out the protomolecule for more money than any of us have ever seen.Or maybe they just shoot you.Mars just wins against Earth.And the Belt.Or you go to the OPA, who are the best hope the Belt has of independence, and theyre a bunch of crazy zealots, half of em thinking we can actually sustain out there without Earth.And trust me, theyll probably shoot you too.Or you just tell everyone everything and pretend that however it comes down, you kept your hands clean.Theres a right thing to do, Holden said.You dont have a right thing, friend, Miller said.Youve got a whole plateful of maybe a little less wrong.Holdens blood flush finished.The captain pulled the needles out of his arm and let the thin metallic tentacles retract.As he rolled down his sleeve, the frown softened.People have a right to know whats going on, Holden said.Your argument boils down to you not thinking people are smart enough to figure out the right way to use it.Has anyone used anything youve broadcast as something besides an excuse to shoot someone they already didnt like?Giving them a new reason wont stop them killing each other, Miller said.You started these wars, Captain.Doesnt mean you can stop them.But you have to try.And how am I supposed to do that?Holden said.The distress in his voice could have been anger.It could have been prayer.Something in Millers belly shifted, some inflamed organ calming enough to slip back into place.He hadnt been aware hed felt wrong until he suddenly felt right again.You ask yourself what happens, Miller said.Ask yourself what Naomid do.Holden barked out a laugh.Is that how you make your decisions?Miller let his eyes close.Juliette Mao was there, sitting on the couch at her old apartment on Ceres.Fighting the crew of the stealth ship to a standstill.Burst open by the alien virus on the floor of her shower stall.Something like it, Miller said.* * *   The report from Ceres, a break from the usual competing press releases, came that night.The governing council of the OPA announced that a ring of Martian spies had been rooted out.The video feed showed the bodies floating out an industrial airlock in what looked like the old docks in sector six.At a distance, the victims seemed almost peaceful.The feed cut to the head of security.Captain Shaddid looked older.Harder.We regret the necessity of this action, she said to everyone everywhere.But in the cause of freedom, there can be no compromise.Thats what its come to, Miller thought, rubbing a hand across his chin.Pogroms after all.Cut off just a hundred more heads, just a thousand more heads, just ten thousand more heads, and then well be free.A soft alert sounded, and a moment later, gravity shifted a few degrees to Millers left.Course change.Holden had made a decision.He found the captain sitting alone and staring at a monitor in ops.The glow lit his face from below, casting shadows up into his eyes.The captain looked older too.You make the broadcast?Miller asked.Nope.Were just one ship.We tell everyone what this thing is and that weve got it, well be dead before Protogen.Probably true, Miller said, sitting at an empty station with a grunt.The gimbaled seat shifted silently.Were going someplace.I dont trust them with it, Holden said.I dont trust any of them with that safe.Probably smart.Im going to Tycho Station.Theres someone there I trust.Trust?Dont actively distrust.Naomi think its the right thing?I dont know.I didnt ask her.But I think so.Close enough, Miller said.Holden looked up from the monitor for the first time.You know the right thing?Holden said.Yeah.What is it?Throw that safe into a long collision course with the sun and find a way to make sure no one ever, ever goes to Eros or Phoebe again, Miller said.Pretend none of this ever happened.So why arent we doing that?Miller nodded slowly.How do you throw away the holy grail?Alex had the Rocinante running at three quarters of a g for two hours while the crew prepared and ate dinner.He would run it back up to three when the break was over, but in the meantime, Holden enjoyed standing on his own two legs at something not too far off from Earth gravity.It was a little heavy for Naomi and Miller, but neither of them complained.They both understood the need for haste.Once the gravity had dropped from the crush of high acceleration, the whole crew quietly gathered in the galley and started making dinner.Naomi blended together fake eggs and fake cheese.Amos cooked tomato paste and the last of their fresh mushrooms into a red sauce that actually smelled like the real thing.Alex, who had the duty watch, had forwarded ship ops down to a panel in the galley and sat at a table next to it, spreading the fake cheese paste and red sauce onto flat noodles in hopes that the end result would approximate lasagna.Holden had oven duty and had spent the lasagna prep time baking frozen lumps of dough into bread.The smell in the galley was not entirely unlike actual food.Miller had followed the crew into the galley but seemed uncomfortable asking for something to do.Instead, he set the table and then sat down at it and watched.He wasnt exactly avoiding Holdens eyes, but he wasnt going out of his way to catch his attention.By unspoken mutual agreement, no one had any of the news channels on.Holden was sure everyone would rush back to check the current state of the war as soon as dinner was over, but for now they all worked in companionable silence.When the prep was done, Holden switched off bread duty and on to moving lasagna filled cookware into and out of the oven.Naomi sat down next to Alex and began a quiet conversation with him about something shed seen on the ops screen.Holden split his time between watching her and watching the lasagna.She laughed at something Alex said and unconsciously twisted one finger into her hair.Holden felt his belly tighten a notch.Out of the corner of his eye, he thought he saw Miller staring at him.When he looked, the detective had turned away, a hint of a smile on his face.Naomi laughed again.She had one hand on Alexs arm, and the pilot was blushing and talking as fast as his silly Martian drawl would let him.They looked like friends.That both made Holden happy and filled him with jealousy.He wondered if Naomi would ever be his friend again.She caught him looking and gave him a conspiratorial wink that probably would have made a lot of sense if hed been able to hear what Alex was saying.He smiled and winked back, grateful just to be included in the moment.A sizzling sound from inside the oven called his attention back.The lasagna was beginning to bubble and run over the sides of the dishes.He pulled on his oven mitts and opened the door.Soups on, he said, pulling the first of the dishes and putting it on the table.Thats mighty ugly looking soup, Amos said.Uh, yeah, Holden said.Its just something Mother Tamara used to say when shed finished cooking.Not sure where it comes from.One of your three mothers did the cooking?How traditional, Naomi said with a smirk.Well, she split it pretty evenly with Caesar, one of my fathers.Naomi smiled at him, a genuine smile now.It sounds really nice, she said.Big family like that.Yeah, it really was, he replied, a vision in his head of nuclear fire tearing apart the Montana farmhouse hed grown up in, his family blowing into ash.If it happened, he was sure Miller would be there to let him know it was his fault.He wasnt sure hed be able to argue anymore.As they ate, Holden felt a slow release of tension in the room.Amos belched loudly, then reacted to the chorus of protests by doing it again even more loudly.Alex retold the joke that had made Naomi laugh.Even Miller got into the mood and told a long and increasingly improbable story about hunting down a black market cheese operation that ended in a gunfight with nine naked Australians in an illegal brothel.By the finish of the story, Naomi was laughing so hard shed drooled on her shirt, and Amos kept repeating No fucking way!like a mantra.The story was amusing enough, and the detectives dry delivery suited it well, but Holden only half listened.He watched his crew, saw the tension falling from their faces and shoulders.He and Amos were both from Earth, though if he had to guess, hed say Amos had forgotten about his home world the first time hed shipped out.Alex was from Mars and clearly still loved it.One bad mistake on either side and both planets might be radioactive rubble by the end of dinner.But right now they were just friends having a meal together.It was right.It was what Holden had to keep fighting for.I actually remember that cheese shortage, Naomi said once Miller had stopped talking.Belt wide.That was your fault?Yeah, well, if theyd only been sneaking cheese past the government auditors, we wouldnt have had a problem, Miller said.But they had this habit of shooting the other cheese smugglers.Makes the cops notice.Bad business.Over fucking cheese?Amos said, tossing his fork onto his plate with a clack.Are you serious?I mean, drugs or gambling or something.But cheese?Gamblings legal, most places, Miller said.And a chemistry class dropout can cook up just about any drug you like in his bathroom.No way to control supply.Real cheese comes from Earth, or Mars, Naomi added.And after they tack on shipping costs and the Coalitions fifty percent in taxes, it costs more than fuel pellets.We wound up with one hundred and thirty kilos of Vermont Cheddar in the evidence lockup, Miller said.Street value that would have probably bought someone their own ship.It had disappeared by the end of the day.We wrote it up as lost to spoilage.No one said a word, as long as everyone went home with a brick.The detective leaned back in his chair with a distant look on his face.My God, that was good cheese, he said with a smile.Yeah, well, this fake stuff does taste like shit, Amos said, then added in a hurry, No offense, Boss, you did a real good job whipping it up.But thats still weird to me, fighting over cheese.Its why they killed Eros, Naomi said.Miller nodded but said nothing.How do you figure that?Amos said.How long have you been flying?Naomi asked.I dunno, Amos replied, his lips compressing as he did the mental math.Twenty five years, maybe?Fly with a lot of Belters, right?Yeah, Amos said.Cant get better shipmates than Belters.Cept me, of course.Youve flown with us for twenty five years, you like us, youve learned the patois.I bet you can order a beer and a hooker on any station in the Belt.Heck, if you were a little taller and a lot skinnier, you could pass for one of us by now.Amos smiled, taking it as a compliment.But you still dont get us, Naomi said.Not really.No one who grew up with free air ever will.And thats why they can kill a million and a half of us to figure out what their bug really does.Hey now, Alex interjected.You serious bout that?You think the inners and outers see themselves as that different?Of course they do, Miller said.Were too tall, too skinny, our heads look too big, and our joints too knobby.Holden noticed Naomi glancing across the table at him, a speculative look on her face.I like your head, Holden thought at her, but the radiation hadnt given him telepathy either, because her expression didnt change.Weve practically got our own language now, Miller said.Ever see an Earther try to get directions in the deep dig?Tu run spin, pow, Schlauch tu way acima and ido,  Naomi said with a heavy Belter accent.Go spinward to the tube station, which will take you back to the docks, Amos said.The fucks so hard about that?I had a partner wouldnt have known that after two years on Ceres, Miller said.And Havelock wasnt stupid.He just wasnt from there.Holden listened to them talk and pushed cold pasta around on his plate with a chunk of bread.Okay, we get it, he said.Youre weird.But to kill a million and a half people over some skeletal differences and slang   People have been getting tossed into ovens for less than that ever since they invented ovens, Miller said.If it makes you feel better, most of us think youre squat and microcephalic.Alex shook his head.Dont make a lick of sense to me, turnin that bug loose, even if you hated every single human on Eros personally.Who knows what that thingll do?Naomi walked to the galley sink and washed her hands, the running water drawing everyones attention.Ive been thinking about that, she said, then turned around, wiping her hands on a towel.The point of it, I mean.Miller started to speak, but Holden hushed him with a quick gesture and waited for Naomi to continue.So, she said.Ive been thinking of it as a computing problem.If the virus or nanomachine or protomolecule or whatever was designed, it has a purpose, right?Definitely, Holden said.And it seems like its trying to do something something complex.It doesnt make sense to go to all that trouble just to kill people.Those changes it makes look intentional, just not complete, to me.I can see that, Holden said.Alex and Amos nodded along with him but stayed quiet.So maybe the issue is that the protomolecule isnt smart enough yet.You can compress a lot of data down pretty small, but unless its a quantum computer, processing takes space.The easiest way to get that processing in tiny machines is through distribution.Maybe the protomolecule isnt finishing its job because it just isnt smart enough to.Yet.Not enough of them, Alex said.Right, Naomi said, dropping the towel into a bin under the sink.So you give them a lot of biomass to work with, and see what it is they are ultimately made to do.According to that guy in the video, they were made to hijack life on Earth and wipe us out, Miller said.And that, Holden said, is why Eros is perfect.Lots of biomass in a vacuum sealed test tube.And if it gets out of hand, theres already a war going on.A lot of ships and missiles can be used for nuking Eros into glass if the threat seems real.Nothing to make us forget our differences like a new player butting in.Wow, Amos said.That is really, really fucked up.Okay.But even though thats probably whats happened, Holden said, I still cant believe that there are enough evil people all in one place to do it.This isnt a one man operation.This is the work of dozens, maybe hundreds, of very smart people.Does Protogen just go around recruiting every potential Stalin and Jack the Ripper it runs across?Ill make sure to ask Mr.Dresden, Miller said, an unreadable expression on his face, when we finally meet.* * *   Tychos habitat rings spun serenely around the bloated zero g factory globe in the center.The massive construction waldoes that sprouted from the top were maneuvering an enormous piece of hull plating onto the side of the Nauvoo.Looking at the station on the ops screens while Alex finished up docking procedures, Holden felt something like relief.So far, Tycho was the one place no one had tried to shoot them, or blow them up, or vomit goo on them, and that practically made it home.Holden looked at the research safe clamped securely to the deck and hoped that he hadnt just killed everyone on the station by bringing it there.As if on cue, Miller pulled himself through the deck hatch and drifted over to the safe.He gave Holden a meaningful look.Dont say it.Im already thinking it, Holden said.Miller shrugged and drifted over to the ops station.Big, he said, nodding at the Nauvoo, on Holdens screen.Generation ship, Holden said.Something like that will give us the stars.Or a lonely death on a long trip to nowhere, Miller replied.You know, Holden said, some species version of the great galactic adventure is shooting virus filled bullets at their neighbors.I think ours is pretty damn noble in comparison.Miller seemed to consider that, nodded, and watched Tycho Station swell on the monitor as Alex brought them closer.The detective kept one hand on the console, making the micro adjustments necessary to remain still even as the pilots maneuvers threw unexpected bursts of gravity at them from every direction.Holden was strapped into his chair.Even concentrating, he couldnt handle zero g and intermittent thrust half that well.His brain just couldnt be trained out of the twenty odd years hed spent with gravity as a constant.Naomi was right.It would be so easy to see Belters as alien.Hell, if you gave them time to develop some really efficient implantable oxygen storage and recycling and kept trimming the environment suits down to the minimum necessary for heat, you might wind up with Belters who spent more time outside their ships and stations than in.Maybe that was why they were taxed to subsistence level.The bird was out of the cage, but you couldnt let it stretch its wings too far or it might forget it belonged to you.You trust this Fred?Miller asked.Sort of, Holden said.He treated us well last time, when everyone else wanted us dead or locked up.Miller grunted, as if that proved nothing.Hes OPA, right?Yeah, Holden said.But I think maybe the real OPA.Not the cowboys who want to shoot it out with the inners.And not those nuts on the radio calling for war.Freds a politician.What about the ones keeping Ceres in line?I dont know, Holden said.I dont know about them.But Freds the best shot we have.Least wrong.Fair enough, Miller said.We wont find a political solution to Protogen, you know.Yeah, Holden said, then began unbuckling his harness as the Roci slid into its berth with a series of metallic bangs.But Fred isnt just a politician.* * *   Fred sat behind his large wooden desk, reading the notes Holden had written about Eros, the search for Julie, and the discovery of the stealth ship.Miller sat across from him, watching Fred like an entomologist might watch a new species of bug, guessing if it was likely to sting.Holden was a little farther away on Freds right, trying not to keep looking at the clock on his hand terminal.On the huge screen behind the desk, the Nauvoo drifted by like the metal bones of some dead and decaying leviathan.Holden could see the tiny spots of brilliant blue light where workers used welding torches on the hull and frame.To occupy himself, he started counting them.Hed reached forty three when a small shuttle appeared in his field of view, a load of steel beams clutched in a pair of heavy manipulator arms, and flew toward the half built generation ship.The shuttle shrank to a point no larger than the tip of a pen before it stopped.The Nauvoo suddenly shifted in Holdens mind from a large ship relatively nearby, to a gigantic ship farther away.It gave him a short rush of vertigo.His hand terminal beeped at almost the same instant that Millers did.He didnt even look at it; he just tapped the face to shut it up.He knew this routine by now.He pulled out a small bottle, took out two blue pills, and swallowed them dry.He could hear Miller pouring pills out of his bottle as well.The ships expert medical system dispensed them for him every week with a warning that failing to take them on schedule would lead to horrific death.He took them.He would for the rest of his life.Missing a few would just mean that wasnt very long.Fred finished reading and threw his hand terminal down on the desk, then rubbed his eyes with the heels of his hands for several seconds.To Holden, he looked older than the last time theyd seen each other.I have to tell you, Jim, I have no idea what to make of this, he finally said.Miller looked at Holden and mouthed, Jim, at him with a question on his face.Holden ignored him.Did you read Naomis addition at the end?Holden asked.The bit with the networked nanobugs for increased processing power?Yeah, that bit, Holden said.It makes sense, Fred.Fred laughed without humor, then stabbed one finger at his terminal.That, he said.That only makes sense to a psychopath.No one sane could do that.No matter what they thought they might get out of it.Miller cleared his throat.You have something to add, Mr.Muller?Fred asked.Miller, the detective replied.Yes.First and all respect here dont kid yourself.Genocides old school.Second, the facts arent in question.Protogen infected Eros Station with a lethal alien disease, and theyre recording the results.Why doesnt matter.We need to stop them.And, Holden said, we think we can track down where their observation station is.Fred leaned back in his chair, the fake leather and metal frame creaking under his weight even in the one third g.   Stop them how?he asked.Fred knew.He just wanted to hear them say it out loud.Miller played along.Id say we fly to their station and shoot them.Who is we?Fred asked.There are a lot of OPA hotheads looking to shoot it out with Earth and Mars, Holden said.We give them some real bad guys to shoot at instead.Fred nodded in a way that didnt mean he agreed to anything.And your sample?The captains safe?Fred said.Thats mine, Holden said.No negotiation on that.Fred laughed again, though there was some humor in it this time.Miller blinked in surprise and then stifled a grin.Why would I agree to that?Fred asked.Holden lifted his chin and smiled.What if I told you that Ive hidden the safe on a planetesimal booby trapped with enough plutonium to break anyone who touches it into their component atoms even if they could find it?he said.Fred stared at him for a moment, then said, But you didnt.Well, no, Holden said.But I could tell you I did.You are too honest, Fred said.And you cant trust anyone with something this big.You already know what Im going to do with it.Thats why, until we can agree on something better, youre leaving it with me.Fred nodded.Yes, he said, I guess I am.The observation deck looked out over the Nauvoo as the behemoth slowly came together.Miller sat on the edge of a soft couch, his fingers laced over his knee, his gaze on the immense vista of the construction.After his time on Holdens ship and, before that, in Eros, with its old style closed architecture, a view so wide seemed artificial.The deck itself was wider than the Rocinante and decorated with soft ferns and sculpted ivies.The air recyclers were eerily quiet, and even though the spin gravity was nearly the same as Ceres, the Coriolis felt subtly wrong.Hed lived in the Belt his whole life, and hed never been anywhere that was designed so carefully for the tasteful display of wealth and power.It was pleasant as long as he didnt think about it too much.He wasnt the only one drawn to the open spaces of Tycho.A few dozen station workers sat in groups or walked through together.An hour before, Amos and Alex had gone by, deep in their own conversation, so he wasnt entirely surprised when, standing up and walking back toward the docks, he saw Naomi sitting by herself with a bowl of food cooling on a tray at her side.Her gaze was fixed on her hand terminal.Hey, he said.Naomi looked up, recognized him, and smiled distractedly.Hey, she said.Miller nodded toward the hand terminal and shrugged a question.Comm data from that ship, she said.It was always that ship, Miller noticed.The same way people would call a particularly godawful crime scene that place.Its all tightbeam, so I thought it wouldnt be so hard to triangulate.But   Not so much?Naomi lifted her eyebrows and sighed.Ive been plotting orbits, she said.But nothings fitting.There could be relay drones, though.Moving targets the ship system was calibrated for that would send the message on to the actual station.Or another drone, and then the station, or who knows?Any data coming off Eros?I assume so, Naomi said, but I dont know that it would be any easier to make sense of than this.Cant your OPA friends do something?Miller asked.Theyve got more processing power than one of these handhelds.Probably have a better activity map of the Belt too.Probably, she said.He couldnt tell if she didnt trust this Fred that Holden had given them over to, or just needed to feel like the investigation was still hers.He considered telling her to back off it for a while, to let the others carry it, but he didnt see he had the moral authority to make that one stick.What?Naomi said, an uncertain smile on her lips.Miller blinked.You were laughing a little, Naomi said.I dont think Ive ever seen you laugh before.I mean, not when something was funny.I was just thinking about something a partner of mine told me about letting cases go when you got pulled from them.What did he say?That its like taking half a shit, Miller said.Had a way with words, that one.He was all right for an Earther, Miller said, and something tickled at the back of his mind.Then, a moment later: Ah, Jesus.I may have something.* * *   Havelock met him in an encrypted drop site that lived on a server cluster on Ganymede.The latency kept them from anything like real time conversation.It was more like dropping notes, but it did the trick.The waiting made Miller anxious.He sat with his terminal set to refresh every three seconds.Would you like anything else?the woman asked.Another bourbon?Thatd be great, Miller said, and checked to see if Havelock had replied yet.He hadnt.Like the observation deck, the bar looked out on the Nauvoo, though from a slightly different angle.The great ship looked foreshortened, and arcs of energy lit it where a layer of ceramic was annealing.A bunch of religious zealots were going to load themselves into that massive ship, that small self sustaining world, and launch themselves into the darkness between the stars.Generations would live and die in it, and if they were mind bendingly lucky enough to find a planet worth living on the end of the journey, the people who came out of it would never have known Earth or Mars or the Belt.Theyd be aliens already.And if whatever had made the protomolecule was out there to greet them, then what?Would they all die like Julie had?There was life out there.They had proof of it now.And the proof came in the shape of a weapon, so what did that tell him?Except that maybe the Mormons deserved a little warning about what they were signing their great grandkids up for.He laughed to himself when he realized that was exactly what Holden would say.The bourbon arrived at the same moment his hand terminal chimed.The video file had a layered encryption that took almost a minute to unpack.That alone was a good sign.The file opened, and Havelock grinned out from the screen.He was in better shape than hed been on Ceres, and it showed in the shape of his jaw.His skin was darker, but Miller didnt know if it was purely cosmetic or if his old partner had been basking in false sunlight for the joy of it.It didnt matter.It made the Earther look rich and fit.Hey, buddy, Havelock said.Good to hear from you.After what happened with Shaddid and the OPA, I was afraid we were going to be on different sides now.Im glad you got out of there before the shit hit the fan.Yeah, Im still with Protogen, and Ive got to tell you, these guys are kind of scary.I mean, Ive worked contract security before, and Im pretty clear when someones hard core.These guys arent cops.Theyre troops.You know what I mean?Officially, I dont know dick about a Belt station, but you know how it is.Im from Earth.There are a lot of these guys who gave me shit about Ceres.Working with the vacuum heads.That kind of thing.But the way things are here, its better to be on the good side of the bad guys.Its just that kind of job.There was an apology in his expression.Miller understood.Working in some corporations was like going to prison.You adopted the views of the people around you.A Belter might get hired on, but hed never belong.Like Ceres, just pointed the other way.If Havelock had made friends with a set of inner planets mercs who spent their off nights curb stomping Belters outside bars, then he had.But making friends didnt mean he was one of them.So.Off the record, yeah, theres a black ops station in the Belt.I hadnt heard it called Thoth, but it could be.Some sort of very scary deep research and development lab.Heavy science crew, but not a huge place.I think discreet would be the word.Lots of automated defenses, but not a big ground crew.I dont need to tell you that leaking the coordinates would get my ass killed out here.So wipe the file when youre done, and lets not talk again for a long, long time.The datafile was small.Three lines of plaintext orbital notation.Miller put it into his hand terminal and killed the file off the Ganymede server.The bourbon still sat beside his hand, and he drank it off neat.The warmth in his chest might have been the alcohol or it might have been victory.He turned on the hand terminals camera.Thanks.I owe you one.Heres part of the payment.What happened on Eros?Protogen was part of it, and its big.If you get the chance to drop your contract with them, do it.And if they try to rotate you out to that black ops station, dont go.Miller frowned.The sad truth was that Havelock was probably the last real partner hed had.The only one whod looked on him as an equal.As the kind of detective Miller had imagined himself to be.Take care of yourself, partner, he said, then ended the file, encrypted it, shipped it out.He had the bone deep feeling he wasnt ever going to talk to Havelock again.He put through a connection request to Holden.The screen filled with the captains open, charming, vaguely naive face.Miller, Holden said.Everything okay?Yeah.Great.But I need to talk to your Fred guy.Can you arrange that?Holden frowned and nodded at the same time.Sure.Whats going on?I know where Thoth Station is, Miller said.You know what?Miller nodded.Where the hell did you get that?Miller grinned.If I gave you that information and it got out, a good man would get killed, he said.You see how that works?* * *   It struck Miller as he, Holden, and Naomi waited for Fred that he knew an awful lot of inner planets types fighting against the inner planets.Or at least not for them.Fred, supposedly a high ranking OPA member.Havelock.Three quarters of the crew of the Rocinante.Juliette Mao.It wasnt what he would have expected.But maybe that was shortsighted.He was seeing the thing the way Shaddid and Protogen did.There were two sides fighting that was true enough but they werent the inner planets versus the Belters.They were the people who thought it was a good idea to kill people who looked or acted differently against the people who didnt.Or maybe that was a crap analysis too.Because given the chance to put the scientist from the Protogen pitch, the board of directors, and whoever this Dresden piece of shit was into an airlock, Miller knew hed agonize about it for maybe half a second after he blew them all into vacuum.Didnt put him on the side of angels.Mr.Miller.What can I do for you?Fred.The Earther OPA.He wore a blue button down shirt and a nice pair of slacks.He could have been an architect or a mid level administrator for any number of good, respectable corporations.Miller tried to imagine him coordinating a battle.You can convince me that youve really got what it takes to kill the Protogen station, Miller said.Then Ill tell you where it is.Freds eyebrows rose a millimeter.Come into my office, Fred said.Miller went.Holden and Naomi followed.When the doors closed behind them, Fred was the first to speak.Im not sure exactly what you want from me.Im not in the habit of making my battle plans public knowledge.Were talking about storming a station, Miller said.Something with damn good defenses and maybe more ships like the one that killed the Canterbury.No disrespect intended, but thats a pretty tall order for a bunch of amateurs like the OPA.Ah, Miller?Holden said.Miller held up a hand, cutting him off.I can give you the directions to Thoth Station, Miller said.But if I do that and it turns out you havent got the punch to see this through, then a lot of people die and nothing gets resolved.Im not up for that.Fred cocked his head, like a dog hearing an unfamiliar sound.Naomi and Holden shared a glance that Miller couldnt parse.This is a war, Miller said, warming to the subject.Ive worked with the OPA before, and frankly you folks are a lot better at little guerrilla bullshit than at coordinating anything real.Half of the people who claim to speak for you are crackpots who happened to have a radio nearby.I see youve got a lot of money.I see youve got a nice office.What I dont see what I need to see is that youve got what it takes to bring these bastards down.Taking out a station isnt a game.I dont care how many simulations youve run.This is real now.If Im going to help you, I need to know you can handle it.There was a long silence.Miller?Naomi said.You know who Fred is, right?The Tycho mouthpiece for the OPA, Miller said.That doesnt draw a whole lot of water with me.Hes Fred Johnson, Holden said.Freds eyebrows rose another millimeter.Miller frowned and crossed his arms.Colonel Frederick Lucius Johnson, Naomi said, clarifying.Miller blinked.The Butcher of Anderson Station?he said.The same, Fred said.I have been talking with the central council of the OPA.I have a cargo ship with more than enough troops to secure the station.Air support is a state of the art Martian torpedo bomber.The Roci?Miller said.The Rocinante, Fred agreed.And while you may not believe it, I actually know what Im doing.Miller looked at his feet, then up toward Holden.That Fred Johnson?he said.I thought you knew, Holden said.Well.Dont I feel like the flaming idiot, Miller said.Itll pass, Fred said.Was there anything else you wanted to demand?No, Miller said.And then: Yes.I want to be part of the ground assault.When we take that station crew, I want to be there.Are you sure?Fred said.Taking out a station isnt a game.What makes you think you have what it takes?Miller shrugged.One thing it takes is the coordinates, Miller said.I have got those.Fred laughed.Mr.Miller.If youd like to go down to this station and have whatevers waiting for us down there try to kill you along with the rest of us, I wont stand in your way.Thanks, Miller said.He pulled up his hand terminal and sent the plaintext coordinates to Fred.There you go.My source is solid, but hes not working from firsthand data.We should confirm before we commit.Im not an amateur, Colonel Fred Johnson said, looking at the file.Miller nodded, adjusted his hat, and walked out.Naomi and Holden flanked him.When they reached the wide, clean public hallway, Miller looked to his right, catching Holdens eyes.Really, I thought you knew, Holden said.* * *   Eight days later, the message came.The cargo ship Guy Molinari had arrived, full up with OPA soldiers.Havelocks coordinates had been verified.Something was sure as hell out there, and it appeared to be collecting the tightbeamed data from Eros.If Miller wanted to be part of this, the time had come to move out.He sat in his quarters in the Rocinante for what was likely the last time.He realized with a little twinge, equal parts surprise and sorrow, that he was going to miss the place.Holden, for all his faults and Millers complaints, was a decent guy.In over his head and only half aware of the fact, but Miller could think of more than one person who fit that bill.He was going to miss Alexs odd, affected drawl and Amos casual obscenity.He was going to wonder if and how Naomi ever worked things out with her captain.Leaving was a reminder of things hed already known: that he didnt know what would come next, that he didnt have much money, and that while he was sure he could get back from Thoth station, where and how he went from there was going to be improvisation.Maybe there would be another ship he could sign on with.Maybe hed have to take a contract and save up some money to cover his new medical expenses.He checked the magazine in his gun.Packed his spare clothes into the small, battered pack hed taken on the transport from Ceres.Everything he owned still fit in it.He turned off the lights and made his way down the short corridor toward the ladder lift.Holden was in the galley, twitching nervously.The dread of the coming battle was already showing in the corners of the mans eyes.Well, Miller said.Here we go, eh?Yep, Holden said.Its been a hell of a ride, Miller said.Cant say its all been pleasant, but   Yeah.Tell the others I said goodbye, Miller said.Will do, Holden said.Then, as Miller moved past him toward the lift: So assuming we all actually live through this, where should we meet up?Miller turned.I dont understand, he said.Yeah, I know.Look, I trust Fred or I wouldnt have come here.I think hes honorable, and hell do the right thing by us.That doesnt mean I trust the whole OPA.After we get this thing done, I want the whole crew together.Just in case we need to get out in a hurry.Something painful happened under Millers sternum.Not a sharp pain, just a sudden ache.His throat felt thick.He coughed to clear it.As soon as we get the place secure, Ill get in touch, Miller said.Okay, but dont take too long.If Thoth Station has a whorehouse left standing, Im going to need help prying Amos out of it.Miller opened his mouth, closed it, and tried again.Aye, aye, Captain, he said, forcing a lightness into his voice.Be careful, Holden said.Miller left, pausing in the passageway between ship and station until he was sure hed stopped weeping, and then making his way to the cargo ship and the assault.The Rocinante hurtled through space like a dead thing, tumbling in all three axes.With the reactor shut down and all the cabin air vented, it radiated neither heat nor electromagnetic noise.If it werent for its speeding toward Thoth station significantly faster than a rifle shot, the ship would be indistinguishable from the rocks in the Belt.Nearly half a million kilometers behind it, the Guy Molinari screamed the Rocis innocence to anyone who would listen, and fired its engines in a long slow deceleration.With the radio off, Holden couldnt hear what they were saying, but hed helped write the warning, so it echoed in his head anyway.Warning!Accidental detonation on the cargo ship Guy Molinari has broken large cargo container free.Warning to all ships in its path: Container is traveling at high speed and without independent control.Warning!There had been some discussion about not broadcasting at all.Because Thoth was a black station, theyd be using only passive sensors.Scanning every direction with radar or ladar would light them up like a Christmas tree.It was possible that with its reactor off, the Rocinante could sneak up on the station without being noticed.But Fred had decided that if they were somehow spotted, it would be suspicious enough to probably warrant an immediate counterattack.So instead of playing it quiet, theyd decided to play it loud and count on confusion to help them.With luck the Thoth Station security systems would scan them and see that they were in fact a big chunk of metal flying on an unchanging vector and lacking apparent life support, and ignore them just long enough to let them get close.From far away, the stations defense systems might be too much for the Roci.But up close, the maneuverable little ship could dart around the station and cut it to pieces.All their cover story needed to do was buy them time while the stations security team tried to figure out what was going on.Fred, and by extension everyone in the assault, was betting that the station wouldnt fire until they were absolutely certain they were under attack.Protogen had gone to a lot of trouble to hide their research lab in the Belt.As soon as they launched their first missile, their anonymity was lost forever.With the war going on, monitors would pick up the fusion torch trails and wonder what was up.Firing a weapon would be Thoth Stations last resort.In theory.Sitting alone inside the tiny bubble of air contained in his helmet, Holden knew that if they were wrong, hed never even realize it.The Roci was flying blind.All radio contact was down.Alex had a mechanical timepiece with a glow in the dark face, and a to the second schedule memorized.They couldnt beat Thoth at high tech, so they were flying as low tech as you could get.If theyd missed their guess and the station fired on them, the Roci would be vaporized without warning.Holden had once dated a Buddhist who said that death was merely a different state of being, and people only feared the unknown that lay behind that transition.Death without warning was preferable, as it removed all fear.He felt he now had the counterargument.To keep his mind busy, he ran through the plan again.When they were practically close enough to spit on Thoth station, Alex would fire up the reactor and do a braking maneuver at nearly ten gs.The Guy Molinari would begin spraying radio static and laser clutter at the station to confuse its targeting package for the few moments the Roci would need to come around on an attack vector.The Roci would engage the stations defenses, disabling anything that could hurt the Molinari, while the cargo ship moved in to breach the stations hull and drop off her assault troops.There were any number of things wrong with this plan.If the station decided to fire early, just in case, the Roci could die before the fight even started.If the stations targeting system could cut the Molinaris static and laser clutter, they might begin firing while the Roci was still getting into position.And even if all that worked perfectly, there was still the assault team, cutting their way into the station and fighting corridor to corridor to the nerve center to take control.Even the inner planets best marines were terrified of breaching actions, and for good reason.Moving through unfamiliar metal hallways without cover while the enemy ambushed you at every intersection was a good way to get a lot of people killed.In training simulations back in the Earth navy, Holden had never seen the marines do better than 60 percent casualties.And these werent inner planet marines with years of training and state of the art equipment.They were OPA cowboys with whatever gear they could scrape together at the last minute.But even that wasnt what really worried Holden.What really worried him was the large, slightly warmer than space area just a few dozen meters above Thoth station.The Molinari had spotted it and warned them before cutting them loose.Having seen the stealth ships before, no one on the Roci doubted that this was another one.Fighting the station would be bad enough, even up close, where most of the stations advantages were lost.But Holden didnt look forward to dodging torpedo fire from a missile frigate at the same time.Alex had assured him that if they could get in close enough to the station, they could keep the frigate from firing at them for fear of damaging Thoth, and that the Rocis greater maneuverability would make it more than a match for the larger and more heavily armed ship.The stealth frigates were a strategic weapon, hed said, not a tactical one.Holden hadnt said, Then why do they have one here?Holden moved to glance down at his wrist, then snorted with frustration in the pitch black of the ops deck.His suit was powered down, chronometers and lights both.The only system on in his suit was air circulation, and that was strictly mechanical.If something got fouled up with it, no little warning lights would come on; hed just choke and die.He glanced around the dark room and said, Come on, how much longer?As if in answer, lights began flickering on through the cabin.There was a burst of static in his helmet; then Alexs drawling voice said, Internal comms online.Holden began flipping switches to bring the rest of the systems back up.Reactor, he said.Two minutes, Amos replied from the engine room.Main computer.Thirty seconds to reboot, Naomi said, and waved at him from across the ops deck.The lights had come up enough for them to see each other.Weps?Alex laughed with something like genuine glee over the comm.Weapons are coming online, he said.As soon as Naomi gives me back the targeting comp, well be cocked, locked, and ready to rock.Hearing everyone check in after the long and silent darkness of their approach reassured him.Being able to look across the room and see Naomi working at her tasks eased a dread he hadnt even realized hed been feeling.Targeting should be up now, Naomi said.Roger that, Alex replied.Scopes are up.Radar, up.Ladar, up Shit, Naomi, you seeing this?I see it, Naomi said.Captain, getting engine signatures from the stealth ship.Theyre powering up too.We expected that, Holden said.Everyone stay on task.One minute, Amos said.Holden turned on his console and pulled up his tactical display.In the scope, Thoth Station turned in a lazy circle while the slightly warm spot above it got hot enough to resolve a rough hull outline.Alex, that doesnt look like the last frigate, Holden said.Does the Roci recognize it yet?Not yet, Cap, but shes workin on it.Thirty seconds, Amos said.Getting ladar searches from the station, Naomi said.Broadcasting chatter.Holden watched on his screen as Naomi tried to match the wavelength the station was using to target them, and began spraying the station with their own laser comm array to confuse the returns.Fifteen seconds, Amos said.Okay, buckle up, kids, Alex said.Here comes the juice.Even before Alex had finished saying it, Holden felt a dozen pinpricks as his chair pumped him full of drugs to keep him alive during the coming deceleration.His skin went tight and hot, and his balls crawled up into his belly.Alex seemed to be speaking in slow motion.Five four three two   He never said one.Instead, a thousand pounds sat on Holdens chest and rumbled like a laughing giant as the Rocis engine slammed on the brakes at ten gs.Holden thought he could actually feel his lungs scraping the inside of his rib cage as his chest did its best to collapse.But the chair pulled him into a soft gel filled embrace, and the drugs kept his heart beating and his brain processing.He didnt black out.If the high g maneuvering killed him, hed be wide awake and lucid for the entire thing.His helmet filled with the sound of gurgling and labored breathing, only some of which was his own.Amos managed part of a curse before his jaw was clamped shut.Holden couldnt hear the Roci shuddering with the strain of her course change, but he could feel it through the seat.She was tough.Tougher than any of them.Theyd be long dead before the ship pulled enough gs to hurt itself.When relief came, it came so suddenly that Holden almost vomited.The drugs in his system stopped that too.He took a deep breath and the cartilage of his sternum clicked painfully back into place.Check in, he muttered.His jaw hurt.Comm array targeted, Alex replied immediately.Thoth Stations comm and targeting array was the first item on their target priority list.All green, Amos said from below.Sir, Naomi said, a warning in her voice.Shit, I see it, Alex said.Holden told his console to mirror Naomis so he could see what she was looking at.On her screen, the Roci had figured out why it couldnt identify the stealth ship.There were two ships, not one large and ungainly missile frigate that they could dance around and cut to pieces at close range.No, that would have been too easy.These were two much smaller ships parked close together to trick enemy sensors.And now they were both firing their engines and splitting up.Okay, Holden thought.New plan.Alex, get their attention, he said.Cant let them go after the Molinari.Roger, Alex replied.One away.Holden felt the Roci shudder as Alex fired a torpedo at one of the two ships.The smaller ships were rapidly changing speed and vector, and the torpedo had been fired hastily and from a bad angle.It wouldnt score a hit, but the Roci would be on everyones scope as a threat now.So that was good.Both of the smaller ships darted away in opposite directions at full burn, spraying chaff and laser chatter behind them as they went.The torpedo wobbled in its trajectory and then limped away in a random direction.Naomi, Alex, any idea what were facing here?Holden asked.Roci still doesnt recognize them, sir, Naomi said.New hull design, Alex said over her.But theyre flyin like fast interceptors.Guessin a torpedo or two on the belly, and a keel mounted rail gun.Faster and more maneuverable than the Roci, but theyd be able to fire in only one direction.Alex, come around to  Holdens order was cut short when the Rocinante shuddered and jumped sideways, hurling him into the side of his restraints with rib bruising force.Were hit!Amos and Alex yelled at the same time.Station shot us with some sort of heavy gauss cannon, Naomi said.Damage, Holden said.Went clean through us, Cap, Amos said.Galley and the machine shop.Got yellows on the board, but nothing thatll kill us.Nothing thatll kill us sounded good, but Holden felt a pang for his coffeemaker.Alex, Holden said.Forget the little ships, kill that comm array.Roger, Alex replied, and the Roci lurched sideways as Alex changed course to begin his torpedo run on the station.Naomi, as soon as the first one of those fighters comes around on his attack run, give him the comm laser in the face, full strength, and start dropping chaff.Yes, sir, she replied.Maybe the laser would be enough to screw up his targeting system for a few seconds.Stations openin up with the PDCs, Alex said.Thisll get a mite bumpy.Holden switched from mirroring Naomis screen to watching Alexs.His panel filled with thousands of rapidly moving balls of light and Thoth station rotating in the background.The Rocis threat computer was outlining the incoming point defense cannon fire with bright light on Alexs HUD.It was moving impossibly fast, but at least with the system doing a bright overlay on each round, the pilot could see where the fire was coming from and which direction it was traveling.Alex reacted to this threat information with consummate skill, maneuvering away from the PDCs direction of fire in quick, almost random movements that forced the automated targeting of the point defense cannons to adjust constantly.To Holden, it looked like a game.Incredibly fast blobs of light flew up from the space station in chains, like long and thin pearl necklaces.The ship moved restlessly, finding the gaps between the threads and dodging away to a new gap before the strands could react and touch her.But Holden knew that each blob of light represented a chunk of Teflon coated tungsten steel with a depleted uranium heart, going thousands of meters per second.If Alex lost the game, theyd know it when the Rocinante was cut to pieces.Holden almost jumped out of his skin when Amos spoke.Shit, Cap, got a leak somewhere.Three port maneuvering thrusters are losing water pressure.Going to patch it.Copy, Amos.Go fast, Holden said.You hang on down there, Amos, Naomi said.Amos just snorted.On his console, Holden watched as Thoth Station grew larger on the scope.Somewhere behind them, the two fighters were probably coming about.The thought made the back of Holdens head itch, but he tried to keep focus.The Roci didnt have enough torpedoes for Alex to fire shot after shot at the station from far off and hope one made it through the point defense fire.Alex had to bring them in so close that the cannons couldnt shoot the torpedo down.A blue highlight appeared on the HUD surrounding a portion of the stations central hub.The highlighted portion expanded into a smaller subscreen.Holden could make out the dishes and antennas that made up the comm and targeting array.One away, Alex said, and the Roci vibrated as her second torpedo was fired.Holden shook violently in his restraints and then slapped back into his chair as Alex took the Roci through a series of sudden maneuvers and then slammed down the throttle to evade the last of the PDC fire.Holden watched his screen as the red dot of their missile streaked toward the station and struck the comm array.A flash blanked out his screen for a second and then faded.Almost immediately the PDC fire stopped.Good sh  Holden was cut off by Naomi yelling, Bogey one has fired!Two fast movers!Holden flipped back to her screen and saw the threat system tracking both fighters and two smaller and much faster objects moving toward the Roci on an intercept course.Alex!Holden said.Got it, Chief.Going defensive.Holden slammed back into his chair again as Alex poured on the speed.The steady rumble of the engine seemed to stutter, and Holden realized he was feeling the constant fire of their own PDCs as they tried to shoot down the pursuing missiles.Well, fuck, Amos said almost conversationally.Where are you?Holden asked, then flipped his screen to Amos suit camera.The mechanic was in a dimly illuminated crawl space filled with conduit and piping.That meant he was between the inner and outer hulls.In front of him, a section of damaged pipe looked like snapped bones.A cutting torch floated nearby.The ship bounced violently, banging the mechanic around in the tight space.Alex whooped over the comm.Missiles did not impact!he said.Tell Alex to stop jerking her around, Amos said.Makes it hard to hang on to my tools.Amos, get back to your crash couch!Naomi said.Sorry, Boss, Amos replied with a grunt as he yanked one end of the broken pipe free.If I dont fix this and we lose pressure, Alex wont be able to turn to starboard anymore.Bet thatll fuck us up good.Keep working, Amos, Holden said over Naomis protests.But hang on.This is going to get worse.Amos said, Roger that.Holden switched back to Alexs HUD display.Holden, Naomi said.There was fear in her voice.Amos is going to get   Hes doing his job.Do yours.Alex, we have to take these two out before the Molinari gets here.Get me an intercept on one of them and lets kick its ass.Roger that, Cap, Alex said.Going after bogey two.Could use some help with bogey one.Bogey one is Naomis priority, Holden said.Do what you can to keep it off of our backside while we kill his friend.Roger, Naomi said in a tight voice.Holden switched back to Amos helmet camera, but the mechanic seemed to be doing fine.He was cutting the damaged pipe free with his torch, and a length of replacement pipe floated nearby.Strap that pipe down, Amos, Holden said.All respect, Captain, Amos said, but safety standards can kiss my ass.Im getting this done fast and getting outta here.Holden hesitated.If Alex had to make a course correction, the floating pipe could turn into a projectile massive enough to kill Amos or break the Roci.Its Amos, he told himself.He knows what hes doing.Holden flipped to Naomis screen as she poured everything the comm system had at the small interceptor, trying to blind it with light and radio static.Then he went back to his tactical display.The Roci and bogey two flew toward each other at suicidal speeds.As soon as they passed the point where incoming torpedo fire couldnt be avoided, bogey two launched both his missiles.Alex flagged the two fast movers for the PDCs and kept up his intercept course but didnt launch missiles.Alex, why arent we shooting?Holden said.Gonna shoot his torpedoes down, then get in close and let the PDCs chew him up, the pilot replied.Why?Weve only got so many torpedoes and no resupply.No call to waste em on these munchkins.The incoming torpedoes arced forward on Holdens display, and he felt the Rocis PDCs firing to shoot them down.Alex, he said.We didnt pay for this ship.Feel free to use it up.If I get killed so you can save ammo, I am going to put a reprimand in your permanent file.Well, you put it that way  Alex said.Then: One away.The red dot of their torpedo streaked off toward bogey two.The incoming missiles got closer and closer, and then one disappeared from the display.Alex said, Shit, in a flat voice, and then the Rocinante slammed sideways hard enough that Holden broke his nose on the inside of his helmet.Yellow emergency lights began rotating on all the bulkheads, though with the ship evacuated of air, Holden mercifully couldnt hear the Klaxons that were trying to sound throughout it.His tactical display flickered, went out, and then came back after a second.When it came back up, all three torpedoes, as well as bogey two, were gone.Bogey one continued to bear down on them from astern.Damage!Holden yelled, hoping the comm was still up.Major damage to the outer hull, Naomi replied.Four maneuvering thrusters gone.One PDC nonresponsive.Weve also lost O storage, and the crew airlock looks like its slag.Why are we alive?Holden asked while he flipped through the damage report and then over to Amos suit camera.The fish didnt hit us, Alex said.The PDC got it, but it was close.Warhead detonated and sprayed us down pretty good.It didnt look like Amos was moving.Holden yelled, Amos!Report!Yeah, yeah, still here, Captain.Just hanging on in case we get knocked around like that again.I think I busted a rib on one of the hull braces, but Im strapped down.Good fucking thing I didnt waste time with that pipe, though.Holden didnt take time to answer.He flipped back to his tactical display and watched the rapidly approaching bogey one.It had already fired its torpedoes, but at close range it could still cut them apart with its cannon.Alex, can you get us turned around and get a firing solution on that fighter?he said.Working on it.Dont have much maneuverability, Alex replied, and the Roci began rotating with a series of lurches.Holden switched to a telescope and zoomed in on the approaching fighter.Up close, the muzzle of its cannon looked as big around as a corridor on Ceres, and it appeared to be aimed directly at him.Alex, he said.Working on it, Chief, but the Rocis hurtin.The enemy ships cannon flared open, preparing to fire.Alex, kill it.Kill it kill it kill it.One away, the pilot said, and the Rocinante shuddered.Holdens console threw him out of the scope view and back to the tactical view automatically.The Rocis torpedo flew toward the fighter at almost the same instant that the fighter opened up with its cannon.The display showed the incoming rounds as small red dots moving too fast to follow.Incom  he shouted, and the Rocinante came apart around him.* * *   Holden came to.The inside of the ship was filled with flying debris and bits of superheated metal shavings that looked like slow motion showers of sparks.With no air, they bounced off walls and then floated, slowly cooling, like lazy fireflies.He had a vague memory of one corner of a wall mounted monitor detaching and bouncing off three bulkheads in the worlds most elaborate billiards shot, then hitting him right below the sternum.He looked down, and the little chunk of monitor was floating a few centimeters in front of him, but there was no hole in his suit.His guts hurt.The ops console chair next to Naomi had a hole in it; green gel slowly leaked into small balls that floated away in the zero g.  Holden looked at the hole in the chair, and the matching hole in the bulkhead across the room, and realized that the round must have passed within centimeters of Naomis leg.A shudder swept through him, leaving him nauseated in its wake.What the fuck was that?Amos asked quietly.And how about we dont do it anymore?Alex?Holden said.Still here, Cap, the pilot replied, his voice eerily calm.My panels dead, Holden said.Did we kill that son of a bitch?Yeah, Cap, hes dead.About half a dozen of his rounds actually hit the Roci.Looks like they went through us from bow to stern.That anti spalling webbing on the bulkheads really keeps the shrapnel down, doesnt it?Alexs voice had started shaking.He meant We should all be dead.Open a channel to Fred, Naomi, Holden said.She didnt move.Naomi?Right.Fred, she said, then tapped on her screen.Holdens helmet was filled with static for a second, then with Freds voice.Guy Molinari here.Glad you guys are still alive.
