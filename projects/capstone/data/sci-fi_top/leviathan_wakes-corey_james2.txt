McDowell gave me one last order.Naomi looked him over critically; he could see her distrust.He didnt defend himself; he just waited until she was done.She nodded at him once and climbed down the ladder to the deck below.Once she was gone, he worked methodically, putting together a broadcast package that included all the sensor data from the Canterbury and the Knight.Alex climbed down from the cockpit and sat down heavily in the next chair.You know, Captain, Ive been thinkin, he said.His voice had the same post juice shakes as Holdens own.Holden bit back his irritation at the interruption and said, What about?That stealth ship.Holden turned away from his work.Tell me.So, I dont know any pirates that have shit like that.Go on.In fact, the only time Ive seen tech like that was back when I was in the navy, Alex said.We were working on ships with energy absorbing skins and internal heat sinks.More of a strategic weapon than a tactical one.You cant hide an active drive, but if you can get into position and shut the drive down, store all your waste heat internally, you can hide yourself pretty good.Add in the energy absorbing skin, and radar, ladar, and passive sensors dont pick you up.Plus, pretty tough to get nuclear torpedoes outside of the military.Youre saying the Martian navy did this?Alex took a long shuddering breath.If we had it, you know the Earthers were workin on it too, he said.They looked at each other across the narrow space, the implications heavier than a ten g burn.Holden pulled the transmitter and battery theyd recovered from the Scopuli out of the thigh pocket of his suit.He started pulling it apart, looking for a stamp or an insignia.Alex watched, quiet for once.The transmitter was generic; it could have come from the radio room of any ship in the solar system.The battery was a nondescript gray block.Alex reached out and Holden handed it to him.Alex pried off the gray plastic cover and flipped the metal battery around in his hands.Without saying a word, he held the bottom up to Holdens face.Stamped in the black metal on the bottom of the battery was a serial number that began with the letters MCRN.Martian Congressional Republic Navy.* * *   The radio was set to broadcast on full power.The data package was ready to transmit.Holden stood in front of the camera, leaning a little forward.My name is James Holden, he said, and my ship, the Canterbury, was just destroyed by a warship with stealth technology and what appear to be parts stamped with Martian navy serial numbers.Data stream to follow.The cart sped through the tunnel, siren masking the whine of motors.Behind them, they left curious civilians and the scent of overheated bearings.Miller leaned forward in his seat, willing the cart to go faster.They were three levels and maybe four kilometers from the station house.Okay, Havelock said.Im sorry, but Im missing something here.What?Miller said.He meant What are you yammering about?Havelock took it as What are you missing?A water hauler millions of klicks from here got vaporized.Why are we going to full alert?Our cisterns will last months without even going on rationing.There are a lot of other haulers out there.Why is this a crisis?Miller turned and looked at his partner straight on.The small, stocky build.The thick bones from a childhood in full g.  Just like the asshole in the transmission.They didnt understand.If Havelock had been in this James Holdens place, he might have done the same stupid, irresponsible, idiotic bullshit.For the space of a breath, they werent security anymore.They werent partners.They were a Belter and an Earther.Miller looked away before Havelock could see the change in his eyes.That prick Holden?The one in the broadcast?Miller said.He just declared war on Mars for us.The cart swerved and bobbed, its internal computer adjusting for some virtual hiccup in the traffic flow half a kilometer ahead.Havelock shifted, grabbing for the support strut.They hit a ramp up to the next level, civilians on foot making a path for them.You grew up where the waters maybe dirty, but it falls out of the sky for you, Miller said.The airs filthy, but its not going away if your door seals fail.Its not like that out here.But were not on the hauler.We dont need the ice.We arent under threat, Havelock said.Miller sighed, rubbing his eyes with thumb and knuckle until ghosts of false color bloomed.When I was homicide, Miller said, there was this guy.Property management specialist working a contract out of Luna.Someone burned half his skin off and dropped him out an airlock.Turned out he was responsible for maintenance on sixty holes up on level thirty.Lousy neighborhood.Hed been cutting corners.Hadnt replaced the air filters in three months.There was mold growing in three of the units.And you know what we found after that?What?Havelock asked.Not a goddamn thing, because we stopped looking.Some people need to die, and he was one.And the next guy that took the job cleaned the ducting and swapped the filters on schedule.Thats what its like in the Belt.Anyone who came out here and didnt put environmental systems above everything else died young.All us still out here are the ones that cared.Selective effect?Havelock said.Youre seriously arguing in favor of selective effect?I never thought Id hear that shit coming out of you.Whats that?Racist propaganda bullshit, Havelock said.Its the one that says the difference in environment has changed the Belters so much that instead of just being a bunch of skinny obsessive compulsives, they arent really human anymore.Im not saying that, Miller said, suspecting that it was exactly what he was saying.Its just that Belters dont take the long view when you screw with basic resources.That water was future air, propellant mass, and potables for us.We have no sense of humor about that shit.The cart hit a ramp of metalwork grate.The lower level fell away below them.Havelock was silent.This Holden guy didnt say it was Mars.Just that they found a Martian battery.You think people are going to declare war?Havelock said.Just on the basis of this one guys pictures of a battery?The ones that wait to get the whole story arent our problem.At least not tonight, he thought.Once the whole story gets out, well see where we stand.The station house was somewhere between one half and three quarters full.Security men stood in clumps, nodding to each other, eyes narrow and jaws tight.One of the vice cops laughed at something, his amusement loud, forced, smelling of fear.Miller saw the change in Havelock as they walked across the common area to their desks.Havelock had been able to put Millers reaction down to one mans being oversensitive.A whole room, though.A whole station house.By the time they reached their chairs, Havelocks eyes were wide.Captain Shaddid came in.The bleary look was gone.Her hair was pulled back, her uniform crisp and professional, her voice as calm as a surgeon in a battlefield hospital.She stepped up on the first desk she came to, improvising a pulpit.Ladies and gentlemen, she said.Youve seen the transmission.Any questions?Who let that fucking Earther near a radio?someone shouted.Miller saw Havelock laugh along with the crowd, but it didnt reach his eyes.Shaddid scowled and the crowd quieted.Heres the situation, she said.No way we can control this information.It was broadcast everywhere.We have five sites on the internal network that have been mirroring it, and we have to assume its public knowledge starting ten minutes ago.Our job now is to keep the rioting to a minimum and ensure station integrity around the port.Station houses fifty and two thirteen are helping on it too.The port authority has released all the ships with inner planet registry.That doesnt mean theyre all gone.They still have to round up their crews.But it does mean theyre going.The government offices?Miller said, loud enough to carry.Not our problem, thank God, Shaddid said.They have infrastructure in place.Blast doors are already down and sealed.Theyve broken off from the main environmental systems, so we arent even breathing their air right now.Well, thats a relief, Yevgeny said from the cluster of homicide detectives.Now the bad news, Shaddid said.Miller heard the silence of a hundred and fifty cops holding their breath.Weve got eighty known OPA agents on the station.Theyre all employed and legal, and you know this is the kind of thing theyve been waiting for.We have an order from the governor that were not going to do any proactive detention.No one gets arrested until they do something.Angry voices rose in chorus.Who does he think he is?someone called from the back.Shaddid snapped at the comment like a shark.The governor is the one who contracted with us to keep this station in working order, Shaddid said.Well follow his directives.In his peripheral vision, Miller saw Havelock nod.He wondered what the governor thought of the question of Belter independence.Maybe the OPA werent the only ones whod been waiting for something like this to happen.Shaddid went on, outlining the security response they were permitted.Miller listened with half an ear, so lost in speculating on the politics behind the situation he almost missed it when Shaddid called his name.Miller will take the second team to the port level and cover sectors thirteen through twenty four.Kasagawa, team three, twenty five through thirty six, and so on.Thats twenty men apiece, except for Miller.I can make it with nineteen, Miller said, then quietly to Havelock, Youre sitting this one out, partner.Having an Earther with a gun out there isnt going to make things better.Yeah, Havelock said.Saw that coming.Okay, Shaddid said.You all know the drill.Lets move.Miller rounded up his riot squad.All the faces were familiar, all men and women hed worked with over his years in security.He organized them in his mind with a nearly automatic efficiency.Brown and Gelbfish both had SWAT experience, so they would lead the wings if it came to crowd control.Aberforth had three write ups for excessive violence since her kid had been busted for drug running on Ganymede, so she was second string.She could work out her anger management issues another time.Around the station house, he heard the other squad commanders making similar decisions.Okay, Miller said.Lets suit up.They moved away in a group, heading for the equipment bay.Miller paused.Havelock remained leaning against his desk, arms folded, eyes locked on the middle distance.Miller was torn between sympathy for the man and impatience.It was hard being on the team but not on the team.On the other hand, what the hell had he expected, taking a contract in the Belt?Havelock looked up, meeting Millers gaze.They nodded to each other.Miller was the first to turn away.The equipment bay was part warehouse, part bank vault, designed by someone more concerned with conserving space than getting things out efficiently.The lights recessed white LEDs gave the gray walls a sterile cast.Bare stone echoed every voice and footfall.Banks of ammunition and firearms, evidence bags and test panels, spare servers and replacement uniforms lined the walls and filled most of the interior space.The riot gear was in a side room, in gray steel lockers with high security electronic locks.The standard outfit consisted of high impact plastic shields, electric batons, shin guards, bullet resistant chest and thigh armor, and helmets with reinforced face guards all of it designed to make a handful of station security into an intimidating, inhuman force.Miller keyed in his access code.The seals released; the lockers opened.Well, Miller said conversationally.Fuck me.The lockers were empty, gray coffins with the corpses all gone.Across the room, he heard one of the other squads shouting in outrage.Miller systematically opened every riot control locker he could get to.All of them were the same.Shaddid appeared at his side, her face pale with rage.Whats plan B?Miller asked.Shaddid spat on the floor, then closed her eyes.They shifted under her lids like she was dreaming.Two long breaths later, they opened.Check the SWAT lockers.There should be enough in there to outfit two people in each squad.Snipers?Miller said.You have a better idea, Detective?Shaddid said, leaning on the last word.Miller raised his hands in surrender.Riot gear was meant to intimidate and control.SWAT gear was made to kill with the greatest efficiency possible.Seemed their mandate had just changed.* * *   On any given day, a thousand ships might be docked on Ceres Station, and activity there rarely slowed and never stopped.Each sector could accommodate twenty ships, the traffic of humanity and cargo, transport vans, mesocranes, and industrial forklifts, and his squad was responsible for twenty sectors.The air stank of refrigerant and oil.The gravity was slightly above 0.3 g, station spin alone lending the place a sense of oppression and danger.Miller didnt like the port.Having vacuum so close under his feet made him nervous.Passing the dockworkers and transport crews, he didnt know whether to scowl or smile.He was here to scare people into behaving and also to reassure them that everything was under control.After the first three sectors, he settled on the smile.It was the kind of lie he was better at.They had just reached the junction of sectors nineteen and twenty when they heard screaming.Miller pulled his hand terminal out of his pocket, connected to the central surveillance network, and called up the security camera array.It took a few seconds to find it: a mob of fifty or sixty civilians stretching almost all the way across the tunnel, traffic blocked on both sides.There were weapons being waved over heads.Knives, clubs.At least two pistols.Fists pumped in the air.And at the center of the crowd, a huge shirtless man was beating someone to death.Showtime, Miller said, waving his squad forward at a run.He was still a hundred meters from the turn that would take them to the clot of human violence when he saw the shirtless man knock his victim to the ground, then stomp on her neck.The head twisted sideways at an angle that didnt leave any question.Miller slowed his team to a brisk walk.Arresting the murderer while surrounded by a crowd of his friends would be tough enough without being winded.There was blood in the water now.Miller could sense it.The mob was going to turn out.To the station, to the ships.If the people started joining the chaos what path would it be likely to take?There was a brothel one level up from there and half a kilometer anti spinward that catered to inner planet types.The tariff inspector for sector twenty one was married to a girl from Luna and had bragged about it maybe once too often.There were too many targets, Miller thought even as he motioned his snipers to spread out.He was trying to reason with a fire.Stop it here, and no one else got killed.In his imagination, Candace crossed her arms and said, Whats plan B?The outer edge of the mob raised the alarm well before Miller reached it.The surge of bodies and threats shifted.Miller tipped back his hat.Men, women.Dark skin, pale, golden brown, and all with the long, thin build of Belters, all with the square mouthed angry gape of chimpanzees at war.Let me take a couple of them down, sir, Gelbfish said from his terminal.Put the fear of God into them.Well get there, Miller said, smiling at the angry mob.Well get there.The face he expected floated to the front.Shirtless.The big man, blood covering his hands and splattered on his cheek.The seed crystal of the riot.That one?Gelbfish asked, and Miller knew that a tiny infrared dot was painting Shirtless forehead even as he glowered at Miller and the uniforms behind him.No, Miller said.Thatll only set the rest of them off.So what do we do?Brown said.It was a hell of a question.Sir, Gelbfish said.The big fuckers got an OPA tattoo on his left shoulder.Well, Miller said, if you do have to shoot him, start there.He stepped forward, tying his terminal into the local system, overriding the alert.When he spoke, his voice boomed from the overhead speakers.This is Detective Miller.Unless you all want to be locked up as accessories to murder, I suggest you disperse now.Muting the microphone in his terminal, he said to Shirtless, Not you, big fella.Move a muscle and we shoot you.Someone in the crowd threw a wrench, the silver metal arcing low through the air toward Millers head.He almost stepped out of the way, but the handle caught him across the ear.His head filled with the deep sound of bells, and the wet of blood tracked down his neck.Hold fire, Miller shouted.Hold your fire.The crowd laughed, as if hed been talking to them.Idiots.Shirtless, emboldened, strode forward.The steroids had distended his thighs so badly that he waddled.Miller turned the mic on his terminal back on.If the crowd was watching them face each other down, they werent breaking things.It wasnt spreading.Not yet.So.Friend.You only kick helpless people to death, or can anybody join in?Miller asked, his voice conversational but echoing out of the dock speakers like a pronouncement from God.The fuck you barking, Earth dog?Shirtless said.Earth?Miller said, chuckling.I look like I grew up in a gravity well to you?I was born on this rock.Inners kibble you, bitch, Shirtless said.You they dog.You think?Fuckin dui, Shirtless said.Fucking true.He flexed his pectorals.Miller suppressed the urge to laugh.So killing that poor bastard was for the good of the station?Miller said.The good of the Belt?Dont be a chump, kid.Theyre playing you.They want you to act like a bunch of stupid riotboys so they have a reason to shut this place down.Schrauben sie sie weibchen, Shirtless said in Belter inflected gutter German, leaning forward.Okay, second time Ive been called a bitch, Miller thought.Kneecap him, Miller said.Shirtless legs blew out in twin sprays of crimson and he went down howling.Miller walked past his writhing body, stepping toward the mob.Youre taking your orders from this pendejo?he said.Listen to me, we all know whats coming.We know dance starting, now, like pow, right?They fucked tu agua, and we all know the answer.Out an airlock, no?He could see it in their faces: the sudden fear of the snipers, then the confusion.He pressed on, not giving them time to think.He switched back to the lower level lingo, the language of education, authority.You know what Mars wants?They want you, doing this.They want this piece of shit here to make sure that everyone looks at Belters and thinks were a bunch of psychopaths who tear up their own station.They want to tell themselves were just like them.Well, we arent.Were Belters, and we take care of our own.He picked a man at the edge of the mob.Not as pumped as Shirtless, but big.He had an OPA split circle on his arm.You, Miller said.You want to fight for the Belt?Dui, the man said.I bet you do.He did too, Miller said, jerking a thumb back at Shirtless.But now hes a cripple, and hes going down for murder.So weve already lost one.You see?Theyre turning us against each other.Cant let them do that.Every one of you I have to arrest or cripple or kill, thats one less we have when the day comes.And its coming.But its not now.You understand?The OPA man scowled.The mob drew back from him, making space.Miller could feel it like a current against him.It was shifting.Days coming, hombre, the OPA man said.You know your side?The tone was a threat, but there was no power behind it.Miller took a slow breath.It was over.Always the side of the angels, he said.Why dont you all go back to work?Shows over here, and weve all got plenty that needs doing.Momentum broken, the mob fell apart.First one and two peeling off from the edges, and then the whole knot untying itself at once.Five minutes after Miller had arrived, the only signs that anything had happened were Shirtless mewling in a pool of his own blood, the wound on Millers ear, and the body of the woman fifty good citizens had stood by and watched be beaten to death.She was short and wearing the flight suit of a Martian freight line.Only one dead.Makes it a good night, Miller thought sourly.He went to the fallen man.The OPA tattoo was smeared red.Miller knelt.Friend, he said.You are under arrest for the murder of that lady over there, whoever the hell she is.You are not required to participate in questioning without the presence of an attorney or union representative, and if you so much as look at me wrong, Ill space you.Do we understand each other?From the look in the mans eyes, Miller knew they did.Holden could drink coffee at half a g.  Actually sit and hold a mug under his nose and let the aroma drift up.Sip it slowly and not burn his tongue.Drinking coffee was one of the activities that didnt make the transition to microgravity well, but at half a g, it was fine.So he sat and tried very hard to think about coffee and gravity in the silence of the Knights tiny galley.Even the normally talkative Alex was quiet.Amos had set his big handgun on the table and was staring at it with frightening concentration.Shed was asleep.Naomi was sitting across the room, drinking tea and keeping one eye on the wall panel next to her.Shed routed ops to it.As long as he kept his mind on his coffee, he didnt have to think about Ade giving one last gasp of fear and then turning into a glowing vapor.Alex ruined it by speaking.At some point, we need to decide where were goin, he said.Holden nodded, took a sip of his coffee, and closed his eyes.His muscles vibrated like plucked strings, and his peripheral vision was dappled with points of imaginary light.The first twinges of the post juice crash were starting, and it was going to be a bad one.He wanted to enjoy these last few moments before the pain hit.Hes right, Jim, Naomi said.We cant just fly in a big circle at half a g forever.Holden didnt open his eyes.The darkness behind his lids was bright and active and mildly nauseating.We arent waiting forever, he said.Were waiting fifty minutes for Saturn Station to call me back and tell me what to do with their ship.The Knight is still P and K property.Were still employees.You wanted me to call for help, I called for help.Now we are waiting to see what that looks like.Shouldnt we start flying toward Saturn Station, then, Boss?Amos asked, directing his question at Naomi.Alex snorted.Not on the Knights engine.Even if we had the fuel for that trip, which we dont, I dont want to sit in this can for the next three months, he said.Naw, if were goin somewhere, its gotta be the Belt or Jupiter.Were as close to exactly between em as you can get.I vote we continue on to Ceres, Naomi said.P and K has offices there.We dont know anyone in the Jupiter complex.Without opening his eyes, Holden shook his head.No, we wait for them to call us back.Naomi made an exasperated sound.It was funny, he thought, how you could make someones voice out from the smallest sounds.A cough or a sigh.Or the little gasp right before she died.Holden sat up and opened his eyes.He placed his coffee mug on the table carefully, with hands that were starting to palsy.I dont want to fly sunward to Ceres, because thats the direction the torpedo ship went, and your point about chasing them is well taken, Naomi.I dont want to fly out to Jupiter, because we only have the fuel for one trip, and once we fly that direction for a while, were locked in.We are sitting here and drinking coffee because I need to make a decision, and P and K gets a say in that decision.So we wait for them to answer, and then I decide.Holden got up slowly, carefully, and began moving toward the crew ladder.Im going to crash for a few minutes, let the worst of the shakes wear off.If P and K calls, let me know.* * *   Holden popped sedative tabs thin, bitter pills with an aftertaste like bread mold but he didnt sleep.Over and over, McDowell placed a hand on his arm and called him Jim.Becca laughed and cursed like a sailor.Cameron bragged about his prowess on the ice.Ade gasped.Holden had flown the Ceres to Saturn circuit on the Canterbury nine times.Two round trips a year, for almost five years.Most of the crew had been there the entire time.Flying on the Cant might be the bottom of the barrel, but that meant there was nowhere else to go.People stayed, made the ship their home.After the near constant duty transfers of the navy, he appreciated stability.Made it his home too.McDowell said something he couldnt quite make out.The Cant groaned like she was under a hard burn.Ade smiled and winked at him.The worst leg cramp in history hit every muscle in his body at once.Holden bit down hard on his rubber mouth guard, screaming.The pain brought an oblivion that was almost a relief.His mind shut off, drowned out by the needs of his body.Fortunately or not, the drugs started to kick in.His muscles unknotted.His nerves stopped screaming, and consciousness returned like a reluctant schoolboy.His jaw ached as he pulled out the guard.Hed worn toothmarks in the rubber.In the dim blue cabin light, he thought about the kind of man who followed an order to kill a civilian ship.Hed done some things in the navy that had kept him awake nights.Hed followed some orders he vehemently disagreed with.But to lock on to a civilian ship with fifty people aboard and press the button that launched six nuclear weapons?He would have refused.If his commanding officer had insisted, hed have declared it an illegal order and demanded that the executive officer take control of the ship and arrest the captain.Theyd have had to shoot him to get him away from the weapon post.Hed known the sort of people who would have followed the order, though.He told himself that they were sociopaths and animals, no better than pirates whod board your ship, strip your engine, and take your air.That they werent human.But even as he nursed his hatred, drug hazed rage offering its nihilistic comforts, he couldnt believe they were idiots.The itch at the back of his head was still Why?What does anyone gain from killing an ice hauler?Who gets paid?Someone always gets paid.Im going to find you.Im going to find you and end you.But before I do, I am going to make you explain.The second wave of pharmaceuticals exploded in his bloodstream.He was hot and limp, his veins filled with syrup.Just before the tabs finally knocked him out, Ade smiled and winked.And blew away like dust.* * *   The comm beeped at him.Naomis voice said, Jim, the P and K response finally came in.Want me to send it down there?Holden struggled to make sense of the words.Blinked.Something was wrong with his bunk.With the ship.Slowly, he remembered.Jim?No, he said.I want to watch it up in ops with you.How long was I out?Three hours, she said.Jesus.They took their sweet time getting back to us, didnt they?Holden rolled out of his couch and wiped off the crust that held his eyelashes together.Hed been weeping in his sleep.He told himself it was from the juice crash.The deep ache in his chest was only stressed cartilage.What were you doing for three hours before you called us back?he wondered.Naomi waited for him at the comm station, a mans face frozen mid word on the screen in front of her.He seemed familiar.That isnt the operations manager.Nope.Its the P and K legal counsel on Saturn Station.The one who gave that speech after the crackdown on supply pilfering?Naomi said.Stealing from us is stealing from you.That one.Lawyer, Holden said with a grimace.This is going to be bad news, then.Naomi restarted the message.The lawyer sprang into motion.James Holden, this is Wallace Fitz calling from Saturn Station.Weve received your request for help, and your report of the incident.Weve also received your broadcast accusing Mars of destroying the Canterbury.This was, to say the least, ill advised.The Martian representative on Saturn Station was in my office not five minutes after your broadcast was received, and the MCR is quite upset by what they view as unfounded accusations of piracy by their government.To further investigate this matter, and to aid in discovering the true wrongdoers, if any, the MCRN is dispatching one of their ships from the Jupiter system to pick you up.The MCRN Donnager is the name of this vessel.Your orders from P and K are as follows: You will fly at best possible speed to the Jupiter system.You will cooperate fully with instructions given you by the MCRN Donnager, or by any officer of the Martian Congressional Republic Navy.You will assist the MCRN in their investigation into the destruction of the Canterbury.You will refrain from any further broadcasting except to us or the Donnager.If you fail to follow these instructions from the company and from the government of Mars, your contract with P and K will be terminated, and you will be considered in illegal possession of a P and K shuttle craft.We will then prosecute you to the fullest extent of the law.Wallace Fitz out.Holden frowned at the monitor, then shook his head.I never said Mars did it.You sort of did, Naomi replied.I didnt say anything that wasnt entirely factual and backed up by the data I transmitted, and I engaged in no speculation about those facts.So, Naomi said.What do we do?* * *  No fucking way, Amos said.No fucking way.The galley was a small space.The five of them filled it uncomfortably.The gray laminate walls showed whorls of bright scrapes where mold had grown once and been cleaned off with microwaves and steel wool.Shed sat with his back against the wall, Naomi across the table.Alex stood in the doorway.Amos had started pacing along the back two fast paces, then a turn before the lawyer had finished his first sentence.Im not happy about it either.But thats the word from the home office, Holden said, pointing at the galleys display screen.Didnt mean to get you guys in trouble.No problem, Holden.I still think you did the right thing, Shed replied, running one hand through his limp blond hair.So what do you think the Martians will do with us?Im thinking pull our fucking toes off until Holden goes back on the radio and says it wasnt them, Amos said.What in the holy hell is this?They attacked us, and now were supposed to cooperate?They killed the captain!Amos, Holden said.Sorry, Holden.Captain, Amos said.But Jesus wept.Were getting fucked here and not the nice way.Were not gonna do this, are we?I dont want to disappear into some Martian prison ship forever, Holden said.The way I see it, we have two options.Either we go along with this, which is basically throwing ourselves on their mercy.Or we run, try to make it to the Belt and hide.Im voting for the Belt, Naomi said, her arms crossed.Amos raised a hand, seconding the motion.Shed slowly raised his own.Alex shook his head.I know the Donnager, he said.Shes not some rock hopper.Shes the flagship for the MCRNs Jupiter fleet.Battleship.Quarter million tons of bad news.You ever serve on a ship that size?No.I wasnt on anything bigger than a destroyer, Holden replied.I served on the Bandon, with the home fleet.We cant go anywhere that a ship like that cant find us.Shes got four main engines, each one bigger than our whole ship.Shes designed for long periods at high g with every sailor on board juiced to the gills.We cant run, sir, and even if we did, her sensor package could track a golf ball and hit it with a torpedo from half the solar system away.Oh, fuck that, sir, Amos said, standing up.These Martian needle dicks blew up the Cant!I say run.At least make it hard for them.Naomi put one hand on Amos forearm, and the big mechanic paused, shook his head, and sat down.The galley was silent.Holden wondered if McDowell had ever had to make a call like this, and what the old man would have done.Jim, this is your decision, she said, but her eyes were hard.No, what you are going to do is get the remaining four members of your crew to safety.And thats all.Holden nodded and tapped his fingers against his lips.P and K doesnt have our back on this one.We probably cant get away, but I dont want to disappear either, Holden said.And then: I think we go, but we dont go quietly.Why dont we go disobey the spirit of an order?* * *   Naomi finished working on the comm panel, her hair now floating around her like a black cloud in the zero g.   Okay, Jim, Im dumping every watt into the comm array.Theyll be getting this loud and clear all the way out to Titania, she said.Holden reached up to run one hand through his sweat plastered hair.In the null gravity, that just made it stick straight out in every direction.He zipped up his flight suit and pressed the record button.This is James Holden, formerly of the Canterbury, now on the shuttle Knight.We are cooperating with an investigation into who destroyed the Canterbury and, as part of that cooperation, are agreeing to be taken aboard your ship, the MCRN Donnager.We hope that this cooperation means that we will not be held prisoner or harmed.Any such action would only serve to reinforce the idea that the Canterbury was destroyed by a Martian vessel.James Holden out.Holden leaned back.Naomi, send that out broadband.Thats a dirty trick, Boss, said Alex.Pretty hard to disappear us now.I believe in the ideal of the transparent society, Mr.Kamal, said Holden.Alex grinned, pushed off, and floated down the gangway.Naomi tapped the comm panel, making a small, satisfied sound in the back of her throat.Naomi, Holden said.She turned, her hair waving lazily, like they were both drowning.If this goes badly, I need you I need you to   Throw you to the wolves, she said.Blame everything on you and get the others back to Saturn Station safely.Yeah, Holden said.Dont play the hero.She let the words hang in the air until the last of the irony leeched out of them.Hadnt crossed my mind, sir, she said.* * *   Knight, this is Captain Theresa Yao of the MCRN Donnager, said the severe looking woman on the comm screen.Message received.Please refrain from further general broadcasts.My navigator will be sending course information shortly.Follow that course exactly.Yao out.Alex laughed.I think you pissed her off, he said.Got the course info.Theyll be picking us up in thirteen days.Give her time to really stew on it.Thirteen days before Im clapped in irons and have needles shoved under my fingernails, Holden sighed, leaning back in his couch.Well, best begin our flight toward imprisonment and torture.You may lock in the transmitted course, Mr.Kamal.Roger that, Cap Huh, said Alex.A problem?Well, the Knight just did her pre burn sweep for collision objects, Alex said.And we have six Belt objects on an intercept course.Belt objects?Fast contacts with no transponder signal, Alex replied.Ships, but flyin dark.Theyll catch us just about two days before the Donnager does.Holden pulled up the display.Six small signatures, yellow orange shifting toward red.Heavy burn.Well, Holden said to the screen.And who the hell are you?Aggression against the Belt is what Earth and Mars survive on.Our weakness is their strength, the masked woman said from Millers terminal screen.The split circle of the OPA draped behind her, like something painted on a sheet.Dont be afraid of them.Their only power is your fear.Well, that and a hundred or so gunships, Havelock said.From what I hear, Miller said, if you clap your hands and say you believe, they cant shoot you.Have to try that sometime.We must rise up!the woman said, her voice growing shrill.We have to take our destiny before it is taken from us!Remember the Canterbury!Miller shut the viewer down and leaned back in his chair.The station was at its change of shift surge, voices raised one over the other as the previous round of cops brought the incoming ones up to speed.The smell of fresh coffee competed with cigarette smoke.Theres maybe a dozen like her, Havelock said, nodding toward the dead terminal screen.Shes my favorite, though.Therere times I swear shes actually foaming at the mouth.How many more files?Miller asked, and his partner shrugged.Two, three hundred, Havelock said, and took a drag on his cigarette.Hed started smoking again.Every few hours, theres a new one.They arent coming from one place.Sometimes theyre broadcast on the radio.Sometimes the files show up on public partitions.Orlan found some guys at a portside bar passing out those little VR squids like they were pamphlets.She bust them?No, Havelock said as if it was no big deal.A week had passed since James Holden, self appointed martyr, had proudly announced that he and his crew were going to go talk to someone from the Martian navy instead of just slinging shit and implications.The footage of the Canterburys death was everywhere, debates raging over every frame.The log files that documented the incident were perfectly legitimate, or they were obviously doctored.The torpedoes that had slaughtered the hauler were nukes or standard pirate fare that breached the drive by mistake, or it was all artifice lifted from old stock footage to cover up what had really killed the Cant.The riots had lasted for three days on and off, like a fire hot enough to reignite every time the air pumped back in.The administrative offices reopened under heavy security, but they reopened.The ports fell behind, but they were catching up.The shirtless bastard who Miller had ordered shot was in the Star Helix detainment infirmary, getting new knees, filling out protests against Miller, and preparing for his murder trial.Six hundred cubic meters of nitrogen had gone missing from a warehouse in sector fifteen.An unlicensed whore had been beaten up and locked in a storage unit; as soon as she was done giving evidence about her attackers, shed be arrested.Theyd caught the kids whod been breaking the surveillance cameras on level sixteen.Superficially, everything was business as usual.Only superficially.When Miller had started working homicide, one of the things that had struck him was the surreal calm of the victims families.People who had just lost wives, husbands, children, and lovers.People whose lives had just been branded by violence.More often than not, they were calmly offering drinks and answering questions, making the detectives feel welcome.A civilian coming in unaware might have mistaken them for whole.It was only in the careful way they held themselves and the extra quarter second it took their eyes to focus that Miller could see how deep the damage was.Ceres Station was holding itself carefully.Its eyes were taking a quarter second longer to focus.Middle class people storekeepers, maintenance workers, computer techs were avoiding him on the tube the way petty criminals did.Conversations died when Miller came near.In the station, the sense of being under siege was growing.A month earlier, Miller and Havelock, Cobb and Richter, and the rest had been the steadying hand of the law.Now they were employees of an Earth based security contractor.The difference was subtle, but it was deep.It made him want to stand taller, to show with his body that he was a Belter.That he belonged there.It made him want to win peoples good opinion back.Let by a bunch of guys passing out virtual reality propaganda with a warning, maybe.It wasnt a smart impulse.Whatve we got on the board?Miller asked.Two burglaries that look like that same ring, Havelock said.That domestic dispute from last week still needs the report closed up.There was a pretty good assault over by Nakanesh Import Consortium, but Shaddid was talking to Dyson and Patel about that, so its probably spoken for already.So you want   Havelock looked up and out to cover the fact that he was looking away.It was something hed been doing more often since things had gone to shit.Weve really got to get the reports done, Havelock said.Not just the domestic.Therere four or five folders that are only still open because they need to be crossed and dotted.Yeah, Miller said.Since the riots, hed watched everyone in a bar get served before Havelock.Hed seen how the other cops from Shaddid down went out of their way to reassure Miller that he was one of the good guys, a tacit apology for saddling him with an Earther.And hed seen Havelock see it too.It made Miller want to protect the man, to let Havelock spend his days in the safety of paperwork and station house coffee.Help the man pretend that he wasnt hated for the gravity hed grown up in.That wasnt a smart impulse either.What about your bullshit case?Havelock asked.What?Havelock held up a folder.The Julie Mao case.The kidnap job.The sideshow.Miller nodded and rubbed his eyes.Someone at the front of the station house yelped.Someone else laughed.Yeah, no, Miller said.Havent touched it.Havelock grinned and held it out to him.Miller accepted the file, flipped it open.The eighteen year old grinned out at him with perfect teeth.I dont want to saddle you with all the desk driving, Miller said.Hey, youre not the one that kept me off that one.That was Shaddids call.And anyway its just paperwork.Never killed anyone.You feel guilty about it, you can buy me a beer after work.Miller tapped the case against the corner of his desk, the small impacts settling the contents against the folders spine.Right, he said.Ill go do some follow up on the bullshit.Ill be back by lunch, write something up to keep the boss happy.Ill be here, Havelock said.Then, as Miller rose: Hey.Look.I didnt want to say anything until I was sure, but I also dont want you to hear it someplace else   Put in for a transfer?Miller said.Yeah.Talked to some of those Protogen contractors that passed through.They say their Ganymede office is looking for a new lead investigator.And I thought  Havelock shrugged.Its a good move, Miller said.Just want to go someplace with a sky, even if you look at it through domes, Havelock said, and all the bluff masculinity of police work couldnt keep the wistfulness out of his voice.Its a good move, Miller said again.* * *   Juliette Andromeda Maos hole was in the ninth level of a fourteen tiered tunnel near the port.The great inverted V was almost half a kilometer wide at the top, and no more than a standard tube width at the bottom, the retrofit of one of a dozen reaction mass chambers from the years before the asteroid had been given its false gravity.Now thousands of cheap holes burrowed into the walls, hundreds on each level, heading straight back like shotgun shacks.Kids played on the terraced streets, shrieking and laughing at nothing.Someone at the bottom was flying a kite in the constant gentle spin breeze, the bright Mylar diamond swerving and bucking in the microturbulence.Miller checked his terminal against the numbers painted on the wall.5151 I.  Home sweet home to the poor little rich girl.He keyed his override, and the dirty green door popped its seals and let him pass.The hole canted up into the body of the station.Three small rooms: general living space at the front, then a bedroom hardly larger than the cot it contained, then a stall with shower, toilet, and half sink all within elbow distance.It was a standard design.Hed seen it a thousand times.Miller stood for a minute, not looking at anything in particular, listening to the reassuring hiss of air cycling through ductwork.He reserved judgment, waiting as the back of his head built an impression of the place and, through it, of the girl whod lived there.Spartan was the wrong word.The place was simple, yes.The only decorations were a small framed watercolor of a slightly abstracted womans face over the table in the front room and a cluster of playing card sized plaques over the cot in the bedroom.He leaned close to read the small script.A formal award granting Julie Mao not Juliette purple belt status by the Ceres Center for Jiu Jitsu.Another stepping her up to brown belt.They were two years apart.Tough school, then.He put his fingers on the empty space on the wall where one for black could go.There was none of the affectation no stylized throwing stars or imitation swords.Just a small acknowledgment that Julie Mao had done what she had done.He gave her points for that.The drawers had two changes of clothes, one of heavy canvas and denim and one of blue linen with a silk scarf.One for work, one for play.It was less than Miller owned, and he was hardly a clotheshorse.With her socks and underwear was a wide armband with the split circle of the OPA.Not a surprise, for a girl whod turned her back on wealth and privilege to live in a dump like this.The refrigerator had two takeaway boxes filled with spoiled food and a bottle of local beer.Miller hesitated, then took the beer.He sat at the table and pulled up the holes built in terminal.True to Shaddids word, Julies partition opened to Millers password.The custom background was a racing pinnace.The interface was customized in small, legible iconography.Communication, entertainment, work, personal.Elegant.That was the word.Not Spartan, but elegant.He paged quickly through her professional files, letting his mind take in an overview, just as he had with the whole living space.There would be time for rigor, and a first impression was usually more useful than an encyclopedia.She had training videos on several different light transport craft.Some political archives, but nothing that raised a flag.A scanned volume of poetry by some of the first settlers in the Belt.He shifted to her personal correspondence.It was all kept as neat and controlled as a Belters.All incoming messages were filtered to subfolders.Work, Personal, Broadcast, Shopping.He popped open Broadcast.Two or three hundred political newsfeeds, discussion group digests, bulletins and announcements.A few had been viewed here and there, but nothing with any sort of religious observation.Julie was the kind of woman who would sacrifice for a cause, but not the kind whod take joy in reading the propaganda.Miller filed that away.Shopping was a long tracking of simple merchant messages.Some receipts, some announcements, some requests for goods and services.A cancellation for a Belt based singles circle caught his eye.Miller re sorted for related correspondence.Julie had signed up for the low g, low pressure dating service in February of the previous year and canceled in June without having used it.The Personal folder was more diverse.At a rough guess there were sixty or seventy subfolders broken down by name.Some were people Sascha Lloyd Navarro, Ehren Michaels.Others were private notations Sparring Circle, OPA.Bullshit Guilt Trips.Well, this could be interesting, he said to the empty hole.Fifty messages dating back five years, all marked as originating at the Mao Kwikowski Mercantile stations in the Belt and on Luna.Unlike the political tracts, all but one had been opened.Miller took a pull from the beer and considered the most recent two messages.The most recent, still unread, was from JPM.Jules Pierre Mao, at a guess.The one immediately before it showed three drafted replies, none of them sent.It was from Ariadne.The mother.There was always an element of voyeurism in being a detective.It was legal for him to be here, poking through the private life of a woman hed never met.It was part of his legitimate investigation to know that she was lonely, that the only toiletries in her bathroom were her own.That she was proud.No one would have any complaints to make, or at least any that carried repercussions for his job, if he read every private message on her partition.Drinking her beer was the most ethically suspect thing hed done since hed come in.And still he hesitated for a few seconds before opening the second to last message.The screen shifted.On better equipment, it would have been indistinguishable from ink on paper, but Julies cheap system shuddered at the thinnest lines and leaked a soft glow at the left edge.The handwriting was delicate and legible, either done with a calligraphic software good enough to vary letter shape and line width, or else handwritten.Sweetheart:  I hope everythings going well for you.I wish you would write to me on your own sometimes.I feel like I have to put in a request in triplicate just to hear how my own daughter is doing.I know this adventure of yours is all about freedom and self reliance, but surely theres still room in there to be considerate.I wanted to get in touch with you especially because your father is going through one of his consolidation phases again, and were thinking of selling the Razorback.I know it was important to you once, but I suppose weve all given up on your racing again.Its just racking up storage fees now, and theres no call to be sentimental.It was signed with the flowing initials AM.Miller considered the words.Somehow hed expected the parental extortions of the very rich to be more subtle.If you dont do as we say, well get rid of your toys.If you dont write.If you dont come home.If you dont love us.Miller opened the first incomplete draft.Mother, if thats what you call yourself:  Thank you so much for dropping yet another turd onto my day.I cant believe how selfish and petty and crude you are.I cant believe you sleep at night or that you ever thought I could  Miller skimmed the rest.The tone seemed consistent.The second draft reply was dated two days later.He skipped to it.Mom:  Im sorry weve been so estranged these last few years.I know its been hard for you and for Daddy.I hope you can see that the decisions Ive made were never meant to hurt either of you.About the Razorback, I wish youd reconsider.Shes my first boat, and I  It stopped there.Miller leaned back.Steady on, kid, he said to the imaginary Julie, then opened the last draft.Ariadne:  Do what you have to.Julie  Miller laughed and raised his bottle to the screen in toast.Theyd known how to hit her where it hurt, and Julie had taken the blow.If he ever caught her and shipped her back, it was going to be a bad day for both of them.All of them.He finished the beer, dropped the bottle into the recycling chute, and opened the last message.He more than half dreaded learning the final fate of the Razorback, but it was his job to know as much as he could.Julie:  This is not a joke.This is not one of your mothers drama fits.I have solid information that the Belt is about to be a very unsafe place.Whatever differences we have we can work out later.FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY COME HOME NOW.Miller frowned.The air recycler hummed.Outside, the local kids whistled high and loud.He tapped the screen, closing the last Bullshit Guilt Trip message, then opened it again.It had been sent from Luna, two weeks before James Holden and the Canterbury raised the specter of war between Mars and the Belt.This sideshow was getting interesting.The ships are still not responding, Naomi said, punching a key sequence on the comm panel.I didnt think they would.But I want to show the Donnager that were worried about being followed.Its all covering our asses at this point, Holden said.Naomis spine popped as she stretched.Holden pulled a protein bar out of the box in his lap and threw it at her.Eat.She peeled the wrapping off while Amos clambered up the ladder and threw himself into the couch next to her.His coverall was so filthy it shined.Just as with the others, three days on the cramped shuttle hadnt helped his personal hygiene.Holden reached up and scratched his own greasy hair with distaste.The Knight was too small for showers, and the zero g sinks were too small to stick your head in.Amos had solved the hair washing problem by shaving all of his off.Now he just had a ring of stubble around his bald spot.Somehow, Naomis hair stayed shiny and mostly oil free.Holden wondered how she did that.Toss me some chow, XO, Amos said.Captain, Naomi corrected.Holden threw a protein bar at him too.Amos snatched it from the air, then considered the long, thin package with distaste.Goddamn, Boss, Id give my left nut for food that didnt look like a dildo, Amos said, then tapped his food against Naomis in mock toast.Tell me about our water, Holden said.Well, Ive been crawling around between hulls all day.Ive tightened everything that can be tightened, and slapped epoxy on anything that cant, so we arent dripping anywhere.Itll still be right down to the wire, Jim, Naomi said.The Knights recycling systems are crap.She was never intended to process five peoples worth of waste back into potables for two weeks.Down to the wire, I can handle.Well just learn to live with each others stink.I was worried about nowhere near enough.Speaking of which, Im gonna head to my rack and spray on some more deodorant, Amos said.After all day crawling in the ships guts, my stinks even keeping me awake tonight.Amos swallowed the last of his food and smacked his lips with mock relish, then climbed out of his couch and headed down the crew ladder.Holden took a bite of his own bar.It tasted like greased cardboard.Whats Shed up to?he asked.Hes been pretty quiet.Naomi, frowning, put her half eaten bar down on the comm panel.I wanted to talk to you about that.Hes not doing well, Jim.Out of all of us, hes having the hardest time with whats happened.You and Alex were both navy men.They train you to deal with losing shipmates.Amos has been flying so long this is actually the third ship thats gone down under him, if you can believe that.And you are made entirely of cast iron and titanium, Holden said, only pretending to joke.Not entirely.Eighty, ninety percent.Tops, Naomi said with a half smile.Seriously, though.I think you should talk to him.And say what?Im no psychiatrist.The navy version of this speech involves duty and honorable sacrifice and avenging fallen comrades.Doesnt work as well when your friends have been murdered for no apparent reason and theres essentially no chance you can do anything about it.I didnt say you had to fix him.I said you needed to talk to him.Holden got up from his couch with a salute.Yes, sir, he said.At the ladder he paused.Again, thank you, Naomi.Id really   I know.Go be the captain, she said, turning back to her panel and calling up the ship ops screen.Ill keep waving at the neighbors.* * *   Holden found Shed in the Knights tiny sick bay.Really more a sick closet.Other than a reinforced cot, the cabinets of supplies, and a half dozen pieces of wall mounted equipment, there was just enough room for one stool stuck to the floor on magnetic feet.Shed was sitting on it.Hey, buddy, mind if I come in?Holden asked.Did I actually say Hey, buddy?Shed shrugged and pulled up an inventory screen on the wall panel, opening various drawers and staring at the contents.Pretending hed been in the middle of something.Look, Shed.This thing with the Canterbury has really hit everyone hard, and youve  Holden said.Shed turned, holding up a white squeeze tube.Three percent acetic acid solution.Didnt realize we had this out here.The Cants run out, and Ive got three people with GW who could really use it.Whyd they put it on the Knight, I wonder, Shed said.GW?was all Holden could think to reply.Genital warts.Acetic acid solution is the treatment for any visible warts.Burns em off.Hurts like hell, but it does the job.No reason to keep it on the shuttle.Medical inventory is always so messed up.Holden opened his mouth to speak, found nothing to say, and closed it again.Weve got acetic acid cream, Shed said, his voice increasingly shrill, but no elemcet for pain.Which do you think youd need more on a rescue shuttle?If wed found anyone on that wreck with a bad case of GW, wed have been set.A broken bone?Youre out of luck.Just suck it up.Look, Shed, Holden said, trying to break in.Oh, and look at this.No coagulant booster.What the hell?Hey, no chance anyone on a rescue mission could, you know, start bleeding.Catch a case of red bumps on your crank, sure, but bleeding?No way!I mean, weve got four cases of syphilis on the Cant right now.One of the oldest diseases in the book, and we still cant get rid of it.I tell those guys, The hookers on Saturn Station are banging every ice bucker on the circuit, so put the glove on, but do they listen?No.So here we are with syphilis and not enough ciprofloxacin.Holden felt his jaw slide forward.He gripped the side of the hatch and leaned into the room.Everyone on the Cant is dead, Holden said, making each word clear and strong and brutal.Everyone is dead.No one needs the antibiotics.No one needs wart cream.Shed stopped talking, and all the air went out of him like hed been gut punched.He closed the drawers in the supply cabinet and turned off the inventory screen with small precise movements.I know, he said in a quiet voice.Im not stupid.I just need some time.We all do.But were stuck in this tiny can together.Ill be honest, I came down here because Naomi is worried about you, but now that Im here, youre freaking me the hell out.Thats okay, because Im the captain now and its my job.But I cant have you freaking Alex or Amos out.Were ten days from being grabbed by a Martian battleship, and thats scary enough without the doctor falling apart.Im not a doctor, Im just a tech, Shed said, his voice very small.Youre our doctor, okay?To the four of us here with you on this ship, youre our doctor.If Alex starts having post traumatic stress episodes and needs meds to keep it together, hell come to you.If youre down here jabbering about warts, hell turn around and go back up to the cockpit and just do a really bad job of flying.You want to cry?Do it with all of us.Well sit together in the galley and get drunk and cry like babies, but well do it together where its safe.No more hiding down here.Shed nodded.Can we do that?he said.Do what?Holden asked.Get drunk and cry like babies?Hell yes.That is officially on the schedule for tonight.Report to the galley at twenty hundred hours, Mr.Garvey.Bring a cup.Shed started to reply when the general comm clicked on and Naomi said, Jim, come back up to ops.Holden gripped Sheds shoulder for a moment, then left.In ops, Naomi had the comm screen up again and was speaking to Alex in low tones.The pilot was shaking his head and frowning.A map glowed on her screen.Whats up?Holden asked.Were getting a tightbeam, Jim.It locked on and started transmitting just a couple minutes ago, Naomi replied.From the Donnager?The Martian battleship was the only thing he could think of that might be inside laser communications range.No.From the Belt, Naomi said.And not from Ceres, or Eros, or Pallas either.None of the big stations.She pointed at a small dot on her display.Its coming from here.Thats empty space, Holden said.Nope.Alex checked.Its the site of a big construction project Tycho is working on.Not a lot of detail on it, but radar returns are pretty strong.Something out there has a comm array thatll put a dot the size of your anus on us from over three AU away, Alex said.Okay, wow, thats impressive.What is our anus sized dot saying?Holden asked.Youll never believe this, Naomi said, and turned on the playback.A dark skinned man with the heavy facial bones of an Earther appeared on the screen.His hair was graying, and his neck was ropy with old muscle.He smiled and said, Hello, James Holden.My name is Fred Johnson.Holden hit the pause button.This guy looks familiar.Search the ships database for that name, he said.Naomi didnt move; she just stared at him with a puzzled look on her face.What?he said.Thats Frederick Johnson, she said.Okay.Colonel Frederick Lucius Johnson.The pause might have been a second; it might have been an hour.Jesus, was all Holden could think to say.The man on the screen had once been among the most decorated officers in the UN military, and ended up one of its most embarrassing failures.To Belters, he was the Earther Sheriff of Nottingham whod turned into Robin Hood.To Earth, he was the hero whod fallen from grace.Fred Johnson started his rise to fame with a series of high profile captures of Belt pirates during one of the periods of tension between Earth and Mars that seemed to ramp up every few decades and then fade away again.Whenever the systems two superpowers rattled their sabers at each other, crime in the Belt rose.Colonel Johnson Captain Johnson at the time and his small wing of three missile frigates destroyed a dozen pirate ships and two major bases in a two year span.By the time the Coalition had stopped bickering, piracy was actually down in the Belt, and Fred Johnson was the name on everyones lips.He was promoted and given command over the Coalition marine division tasked with policing the Belt, where he continued to serve with distinction.Until Anderson Station.A tiny shipping depot almost on the opposite side of the Belt from the major port Ceres, most people, including most Belters, would not have been able to find Anderson Station on a map.Its only importance was as a minor distribution station for water and air in one of the sparsest stretches of the Belt.Fewer than a million Belters got their air from Anderson.Gustav Marconi, a career Coalition bureaucrat on the station, decided to implement a 3 percent handling surcharge on shipments passing through the station in hopes of raising the bottom line.Less than 5 percent of the Belters buying their air from Anderson were living bottle to mouth, so just under fifty thousand Belters might have to spend one day of each month not breathing.Only a small percentage of those fifty thousand lacked the leeway in their recycling systems to cover this minor shortfall.Of those, only a small portion felt that armed revolt was the correct course.Which was why of the million affected, only 170 armed Belters came to the station, took over, and threw Marconi out an airlock.They demanded a government guarantee that no further handling surcharges would be added to the price of air and water coming through the station.The Coalition sent Colonel Johnson.During the Massacre of Anderson Station, the Belters kept the station cameras rolling, broadcasting to the solar system the entire time.Everyone watched as Coalition marines fought a long, gruesome corridor to corridor battle against men with nothing to lose and no reason to surrender.The Coalition won it was a foregone conclusion but it took three days of broadcast slaughter.The iconic image of the video was not one of the fighting, but the last image the station cameras caught before they were cut off: Colonel Johnson in station ops, surrounded by the corpses of the Belters whod made their last stand there, surveying the carnage with a flat stare and hands limp at his sides.The UN tried to keep Colonel Johnsons resignation quiet, but he was too much a public figure.The video of the battle dominated the nets for weeks, only displaced when the former Colonel Johnson made a public statement apologizing for the massacre and announcing that the relationship between the Belt and the inner planets was untenable and heading toward ever greater tragedy.Then he vanished.He was almost forgotten, a footnote in the history of human carnage, until the Pallas colony revolt four years later.This time refinery metalworkers kicked the Coalition governor off station.Instead of a tiny way station with 170 rebels, it was a major Belt rock with more than 150,000 people on it.When the Coalition ordered in the marines, everyone expected a bloodbath.Colonel Johnson came out of nowhere and talked the metalworkers down; he talked the Coalition commanders into holding back the marines until the station could be handed over peacefully.He spent more than a year negotiating with the Coalition governor to improve working conditions in the refineries.And suddenly, the Butcher of Anderson Station was a Belt hero and an icon.An icon who was beaming private messages to the Knight.Holden hit the play button, and that Fred Johnson said, Mr.Holden, I think youre being played.Let me say straight out that I am speaking to you as an official representative of the Outer Planets Alliance.I dont know what youve heard, but we arent all a bunch of cowboys itching for a chance to shoot our way to freedom.Ive spent the last ten years working to make life for the Belters better without anyone getting shot.I believe in this idea so deeply that I gave up my Earth citizenship when I came out here.I tell you that so youll know how invested I am.I may be the one person in the solar system who wants war the least, and my voice is loud in OPA councils.You may have heard some of the broadcasts beating on the war drums and calling for revenge against Mars for what happened to your ship.Ive talked to every OPA cell leader I know, and no ones claiming responsibility.Someone is working very hard to start a war.If its Mars, then when you get on that ship, youll never say another word in public that isnt fed to you by Martian handlers.I dont want to think it is Mars.I cant see how they would get anything out of a war.So my hope is that even after the Donnager picks you up, you can still be a player in what follows.I am sending you a keyword.Next time you broadcast publicly, use the word ubiquitous within the first sentence of the broadcast to signal that youre not being coerced.Dont use it, and Ill assume you are.Either way, I want you to know you have allies in the Belt.I dont know who or what you were before, but your voice matters now.If you want to use that voice to make things better, I will do anything I can to help you do it.If you get free, contact me at the address that follows.I think maybe you and I have a lot to talk about.Johnson out.* * *   The crew sat in the galley drinking a bottle of ersatz tequila Amos had scrounged from somewhere.Shed was politely sipping from a small cup of it and trying to hide his grimace each time.Alex and Amos drank like sailors: a finger full in the bottom of the cup, tossed back all at once.Alex had a habit of saying Hooboy!after each shot.Amos just used a different profanity each time.He was up to his eleventh shot and so far had not repeated himself.Holden stared at Naomi.She swirled the tequila in her cup and stared back.He found himself wondering what sort of genetic mashup had produced her features.Definitely some African and South American in there.Her last name hinted at Japanese ancestry, which was only barely visible, as a slight epicanthic fold.Shed never be conventionally pretty, but from the right angle she was actually fairly striking.Shit, Im drunker than I thought.To cover, he said, So   So Colonel Johnson is calling you now.Quite the important man youve become, sir, Naomi replied.Amos put down his cup with exaggerated care.Been meaning to ask about that, sir.Any chance we might take up his offer of help and just head back to the Belt?he said.Dont know about you, but with the Martian battleship in front, and the half dozen mystery ships behind, its starting to feel pretty fuckin crowded out here.Alex snorted.Are you kidding?If we flipped now, wed be just about stopped by the time the Donnager caught up to us.Shes burnin the furniture to catch us before the Belter ships do.If we start headin their direction, the Donnie might take that as a sign weve switched teams, frag the whole lot of us.I agree with Mr.Kamal, Holden said.Weve picked our course and were going to see it through.I wont be losing Freds contact information anytime soon.Speaking of which, have you deleted his message yet, Naomi?Yes, sir.Scrubbed it from the ships memory with steel wool.The Martians will never know he talked to us.Holden nodded and unzipped his jumpsuit a little further.The galley was starting to feel very hot with five drunk people in it.Naomi raised an eyebrow at his days old T shirt.Embarrassed, he zipped back up.Those ships dont make any sense to me, Boss, Alex said.A half dozen ships flyin kamikaze missions with nukes strapped to their hulls might make a dent in a battlewagon like the Donnie, but not much else would.She opens up with her point defense network and rail guns, she can create a no fly zone a thousand klicks across.They could be killin those six ships with torpedoes already, cept I think theyre as confused about who they are as we are.Theyll know they cant catch us before the Donnager picks us up, Holden said.And they cant take her in a fight.So I dont know what theyre up to.Amos poured the last of the tequila into everyones cups and held his up in a toast.I guess well fucking find out.Captain Shaddid tapped the tip of her middle finger against her thumb when she started getting annoyed.It was a small sound, soft as a cats paws, but ever since Miller first noticed her habit, it had seemed louder.Quiet as it was, it could fill her office.Miller, she said, smiling as if she meant it.Were all on edge these days.These have been hard, hard times.Yes, sir, Miller said, lowering his head like a fullback determined to muscle his way through all defenders, but I think this is important enough to deserve closer   Its a favor for a shareholder, Shaddid said.Her father got jumpy.Theres no reason to think he meant Mars blasting the Canterbury.Tariffs are going up again.There was a mine blowout on one of the Red Moon operations.Eros is having trouble with their yeast farm.We dont go through a day without something happening in the Belt that would make a daddy scared for his precious little flower.Yes, sir, but the timing   Her fingers upped tempo.Miller bit his lips.The cause was lost.Dont go chasing conspiracies, Shaddid said.Weve got a full board of crimes we know are real.Politics, war, system wide cabals of inner planet bad guys searching for ways to screw us over?Not our mandate.Just get me a report that says youre looking, Ill send it back up the line, and we can get back to our jobs.Yes, sir.Anything else?No, sir.Shaddid nodded and turned back to her terminal.Miller plucked his hat from the corner of her desk and headed out.One of the station house air filters had gone bad over the weekend, and the replacement gave the rooms a reassuring smell of new plastic and ozone.Miller sat at his desk, fingers laced behind his head, and stared at the light fixture above him.The knot that had tied itself in his gut hadnt loosened up.That was too bad.Not so good, then?Havelock asked.Could have gone better.She pull the job?Miller shook his head.No, its still mine.She just wants me to do it half assed.Could be worse.At least you get to find out what happened.And if you maybe spend a little time after hours digging into it just for practice, you know?Yeah, Miller said.Practice.Their desks were unnaturally clean, his and Havelocks both.The barrier of paperwork Havelock had created between himself and the station had eroded away, and Miller could tell from his partners eyes and the way his hands moved that the cop in Havelock wanted to get back into the tunnels.He couldnt tell if it was to prove himself before his transfer went through, or just to break a few heads.Maybe those were two ways of saying the same thing.Just dont get yourself killed before you get out of here, Miller thought.Aloud, he said, What have we got?Hardware shop.Sector eight, third level in, Havelock said.Extortion complaint.Miller sat for a moment, considering his own reluctance as if it belonged to someone else.It was like Shaddid had given a dog just one bite of fresh meat, then pointed it back toward kibble.The temptation to blow off the hardware shop bloomed, and for a moment he almost gave in.Then he sighed, swung his feet down to the decking, and stood.All right, then, he said.Lets go make the station safe for commerce.Words to live by, Havelock said, checking his gun.Hed been doing that a lot more recently.The shop was an entertainment franchise.Clean white fixtures offering up custom rigs for interactive environments: battle simulations, exploration games, sex.A womans voice ululated on the sound system, somewhere between an Islamic call to prayer and orgasm with a drumbeat.Half the titles were in Hindi with Chinese and Spanish translations.The other half were English with Hindi as the second language.The clerk was hardly more than a boy.Sixteen, seventeen years old with a weedy black beard he wore like a badge.Can I help you?the boy said, eying Havelock with disdain just short of contempt.Havelock pulled his ID, making sure the kid got a good long look at his gun when he did it.Wed like to talk to Miller glanced at the complaint form on his terminal screen Asher Kamamatsu.He here?The manager was a fat man, for a Belter.Taller than Havelock, the man carried fat around his belly and thick muscles through the shoulders, arms, and neck.If Miller squinted, he could see the seventeen year old boy he had been under the layers of time and disappointment, and it looked a lot like the clerk out front.The office was almost too small for the three of them and stacked with boxes of pornographic software.You catch them?the manager said.No, Miller said.Still trying to figure out who they are.Dammit, I already told you.Theres pictures of them off the store camera.I gave you his fucking name.Miller looked at his terminal.The suspect was named Mateo Judd, a dockworker with an unspectacular criminal record.You think its just him, then, Miller said.All right.Well just go pick him up, throw him in the can.No reason for us to find out who hes working for.Probably no one wholl take it wrong, anyway.My experience with these protection rackets, the purse boys get replaced whenever one goes down.But since youre sure this guys the whole problem     * * *   The managers sour expression told Miller hed made his point.Havelock, leaning against a stack of boxes marked, smiled.Why dont you tell me what he wanted, Miller said.I already told the last cop, the manager said.Tell me.He was selling us a private insurance plan.Hundred a month, same as the last guy.Last guy?Havelock said.So this happened before?Sure, the manager said.Everyone has to pay some, you know.Price of doing business.Miller closed his terminal, frowning.Philosophical.But if its the price of doing business, whatre we here for?Because I thought you you people had this shit under control.Ever since we stopped paying the Loca, Ive been able to turn a decent profit.Now its all starting up again.Hold on, Miller said.Youre telling me the Loca Greiga stopped charging protection?Sure.Not just here.Half of the guys I know in the Bough just stopped showing up.We figured the cops had actually done something for once.Now weve got these new bastards, and its the same damn thing all over again.A crawling feeling made its way up Millers neck.He looked up at Havelock, who shook his head.He hadnt heard of it either.The Golden Bough Society, Sohiros crew, the Loca Greiga.All the organized crime on Ceres suffering the same ecological collapse, and now someone new moving into the evacuated niche.Might be opportunism.Might be something else.He almost didnt want to ask the next questions.Havelock was going to think he was paranoid.How long has it been since the old guys called on you for protection?Miller asked.I dont know.Long time.Before or after Mars killed that water hauler?The manager folded his thick arms; his eyes narrowed.Before, he said.Maybe a month or two.Sthat got to do with anything?Just trying to get the time scale right, Miller said.The new guy.Mateo.He tell you who was backing his new insurance plan?Thats your job, figuring it.Right?The managers expression had closed down so hard Miller imagined he could hear the click.Yes, Asher Kamamatsu knew who was shaking him down.He had balls enough to squeak about it but not to point the finger.Interesting.Well, thanks for that, Miller said, standing up.Well let you know what we find.Glad youre on the case, the manager said, matching sarcasm for sarcasm.In the exterior tunnel, Miller stopped.The neighborhood was at the friction point between sleazy and respectable.White marks showed where graffiti had been painted over.Men on bicycles swerved and weaved, foam wheels humming on the polished stone.Miller walked slowly, his eyes on the ceiling high above them until he found the security camera.He pulled up his terminal, navigated to the logs that matched the camera code, and cross referenced the time code from the stores still frames.For a moment, he thumbed the controls, speeding people back and forth.And there was Mateo, coming out of the shop.A smug grin deformed the mans face.Miller froze the image and enhanced it.Havelock, watching over his shoulder, whistled low.The split circle of the OPA was perfectly clear on the thugs armband the same kind of armband hed found in Julie Maos hole.What kind of company have you been keeping, kid?Miller thought.Youre better than this.You have to know youre better than this.Hey, partner, he said aloud.Think you can write up the report on that interview?Ive got something Id like to do.Might not be too smart to have you there.No offense.Havelocks eyebrows crawled toward his hairline.Youre going to question the OPA?Shake some trees, is all, Miller said.* * *   Miller would have thought that just being a security contractor in a known OPA convivial bar would be enough to get him noticed.In the event, half the faces he recognized in the dim light of John Rock Gentlemens Club were normal citizens.More than one of those were Star Helix, just like him, when they were on duty.The music was pure Belter, soft chimes accompanied by zither and guitar with lyrics in half a dozen languages.He was on his fourth beer, two hours past the end of his shift, and on the edge of giving up his plan as a losing scheme when a tall, thin man sat down at the bar next to him.Acne pocked cheeks gave a sense of damage to a face that otherwise seemed on the verge of laughter.It wasnt the first OPA armband hed seen that night, but it was worn with an air of defiance and authority.Miller nodded.I heard youve been asking about the OPA, the man said.Interested in joining up?Miller smiled and lifted his glass, an intentionally noncommittal gesture.You who Id talk to if I did?he asked, his tone light.Might be able to help.Maybe you could tell me about a couple other things, then, he said, taking out his terminal and putting it on the fake bamboo bar with an audible click.Mateo Judds picture glowed on the screen.The OPA man frowned, turning the screen to see it better.Im a realist, Miller said.When Chucky Snails was running protection, I wasnt above talking to his men.When the Hand took over and then the Golden Bough Society after them.My job isnt to stop people from bending the rules, its to keep Ceres stable.You understand what Im saying?I cant say I do, the pock marked man said.His accent made him sound more educated than Miller had expected.Who is this man?His names Mateo Judd.Hes been starting a protection business in sector eight.Says its backed by the OPA.People say things, Detective.It is Detective, isnt it?But you were discussing realism.If the OPAs making a move on the Ceres black economy, its going to be better all around if we can talk to each other.Communicate.The man chuckled and pushed the terminal back.The bartender paced by, a question in his eyes that wasnt asking if they needed anything.It wasnt meant for Miller.I had heard that there was a certain level of corruption in Star Helix, the man said.I admit Im impressed by your straightforward manner.Ill clarify.The OPA isnt a criminal organization.Really?My mistake.I figured from the way it killed a lot of people   Youre baiting me.We defend ourselves against people who are perpetrating economic terrorism against the Belt.Earthers.Martians.We are in the business of protecting Belters, the man said.Even you, Detective.Economic terrorism?Miller said.That seems a little overheated.You think so?The inner planets look on us as their labor force.They tax us.They direct what we do.They enforce their laws and ignore ours in the name of stability.In the last year, theyve doubled the tariffs to Titania.Five thousand people on an ice ball orbiting Neptune, months from anywhere.The suns just a bright star to them.Do you think theyre in a position to get redress?Theyve blocked any Belter freighters from taking Europa contracts.They charge us twice as much to dock at Ganymede.The science station on Phoebe?We arent even allowed to orbit it.There isnt a Belter in the place.Whatever they do there, we wont find out until they sell the technology back to us, ten years from now.Miller sipped his beer and nodded toward his terminal.So this one isnt yours?No.He isnt.Miller nodded and put the terminal back in his pocket.Oddly, he believed the man.He didnt hold himself like a thug.The bravado wasnt there.The sense of trying to impress the world.No, this man was certain and amused and, underneath it all, profoundly tired.Miller had known soldiers like that, but not criminals.One other thing, Miller said.Im looking for someone.Another investigation?Not exactly, no.Juliette Andromeda Mao.Goes by Julie.Should I know the name?Shes OPA, Miller said with a shrug.Do you know everyone in Star Helix?the man said, and when Miller didnt answer, he added, We are considerably larger than your corporation.Fair point, Miller said.But if you could keep an ear out, Id appreciate it.I dont know that youre in a position to expect favors.No harm asking.The pock faced man chuckled, put a hand on Millers shoulder.Dont come back here, Detective, he said, and walked away into the crowd.Miller took another drink of his beer, frowning.An uncomfortable feeling of having made the wrong step fidgeted in the back of his mind.Hed been sure that the OPA was making a move on Ceres, capitalizing on the death of the water hauler and the Belts uptick in fear and hatred of the inner planets.But how did that fit with Julie Maos father and his suspiciously well timed anxiety?Or the disappearance of Ceres Stations supply of usual suspects in the first place?Thinking about it was like watching a video that was just out of focus.The sense of it was almost there, but only almost.Too many dots, Miller said.Not enough lines.Excuse me?the bartender said.Nothing, Miller said, pushing the half empty bottle across the bar.Thanks.In his hole, Miller turned on some music.The lyrical chants that Candace had liked, back when they were young and, if not hopeful, at least more joyful in their fatalism.He set the lights to half power, hoping that if he relaxed, if for just a few minutes he let go of the gnawing sense that he had missed some critical detail, the missing piece might arrive on its own.Hed half expected Candace to appear in his mind, sighing and looking crossly at him the way she had in life.Instead, he found himself talking with Julie Mao.In the half sleep of alcohol and exhaustion, he imagined her sitting at Havelocks desk.She was the wrong age, younger than the real woman would be.She was the age of the smiling kid in her picture.The girl who had raced in the Razorback and won.He had the sense of asking her questions, and her answers had the power of revelation.Everything made sense.Not only the change in the Golden Bough Society and her own abduction case, but Havelocks transfer, the dead ice hauler, Millers own life and work.He dreamed of Julie Mao laughing, and he woke up late, with a headache.Havelock was waiting at his desk.His broad, short Earther face seemed strangely alien, but Miller tried to shake it off.You look like crap, Havelock said.Busy night?Just getting old and drinking cheap beer, Miller said.One of the vice squad shouted something angry about her files being locked again, and a computer tech scuttled across the station house like a nervous cockroach.Havelock leaned closer, his expression grave.Seriously, Miller, Havelock said.Were still partners, and honest to God, I think you may be the only friend Ive got on this rock.You can trust me.If theres anything you want to tell me, Im good.Thats great, Miller said.But I dont know what youre talking about.Last night was a bust.No OPA?Sure, OPA.Anymore, you swing a dead cat in this station, youll hit three OPA guys.Just no good information.Havelock leaned back, lips pressed thin and bloodless.Millers shrug asked a question, and the Earther nodded toward the board.A new homicide topped the list.At three in the morning, while Miller had been having inchoate dream conversations, someone had opened Mateo Judds hole and fired a shotgun cartridge full of ballistic gel into his left eye.Well, Miller said, called that one wrong.Which one?Havelock said.OPAs not moving in on the criminals, Miller said.Theyre moving in on the cops.The Donnager was ugly.Holden had seen pictures and videos of the old oceangoing navies of Earth, and even in the age of steel, there had always been something beautiful about them.Long and sleek, they had the appearance of something leaning into the wind, a creature barely held on the leash.The Donnager had none of that.Like all long flight spacecraft, it was built in the office tower configuration: each deck one floor of the building, ladders or elevators running down the axis.Constant thrust took the place of gravity.But the Donnager actually looked like an office building on its side.Square and blocky, with small bulbous projections in seemingly random places.At nearly five hundred meters long, it was the size of a 130 story building.Alex had said it was 250,000 tons dry weight, and it looked heavier.Holden reflected, not for the first time, on how so much of the human sense of aesthetics had been formed in a time when sleek objects cut through the air.The Donnager would never move through anything thicker than interstellar gas, so curves and angles were a waste of space.The result was ugly.It was also intimidating.As Holden watched from his seat next to Alex in the cockpit of the Knight, the massive battleship matched course with them, looming close and then seeming to stop above them.A docking bay opened, breaking up the Donnagers flat black belly with a square of dim red light.The Knight beeped insistently, reminding him of the targeting lasers painting their hull.Holden looked for the point defense cannons aimed at him.He couldnt find them.When Alex spoke, Holden jumped.Roger that, Donnager, the pilot said.Weve got steering lock.Im killing thrust.The last shreds of weight vanished.Both ships were still moving at hundreds of kilometers a minute, but their matched courses felt like stillness.Got docking permission, Cap.Take her in?It seems late to make a run for it, Mr.Kamal, Holden said.He imagined Alex making a mistake that the Donnager interpreted as threatening, and the point defense cannons throwing a couple hundred thousand Teflon coated chunks of steel through them.Go slowly, Alex, he said.They say one of those can kill a planet, Naomi said over the comm.She was at the ops station a deck below.Anyone can kill a planet from orbit, Holden replied.You dont even need bombs.Just push anvils out the airlock.That thing out there could kill Shit.Anything.Tiny touches shifted them as the maneuvering rockets fired.Holden knew that Alex was guiding them in, but he couldnt shake the feeling that the Donnager was swallowing them.* * *   Docking took nearly an hour.Once the Knight was inside the bay, a massive manipulator arm grabbed her and put it down in an empty section of the deck.Clamps grabbed the ship, the Knights hull reverberating with a metallic bang that reminded Holden of a brig cells maglocks.The Martians ran a docking tube from one wall and mated up to the Knights airlock.Holden gathered the crew at the inner door.No guns, no knives, no anything that might look like a weapon, he said.Theyll probably be okay with hand terminals, but keep them turned off just in case.If they ask for it, hand it over without complaint.Our survival here may rest on them thinking were very compliant.Yeah, Amos said.Fuckers killed McDowell, but we have to act nice   Alex started to respond, but Holden cut him off.Alex, you did twenty flying with the MCRN.Anything else we should know?Same stuff you said, Boss, Alex replied.Yes sir, no sir, and snap to when given an order.The enlisted guys will be okay, but the officers get the sense of humor trained out of em.Holden looked at his tiny crew, hoping he hadnt killed them all by bringing them here.He cycled open the lock, and they drifted down the short docking tube in the zero g.  When they reached the airlock at the end flat gray composites and immaculately clean everyone pushed down to the floor.Their magnetic boots grabbed on.The airlock closed and hissed at them for several seconds before opening into a larger room with about a dozen people standing in it.Holden recognized Captain Theresa Yao.There were several others in naval officers dress, who were part of her staff; one man in an enlisted uniform with a look of thinly veiled impatience; and six marines in heavy combat armor, carrying assault rifles.The rifles were pointed at him, so Holden put up his hands.Were not armed, he said, smiling and trying to look harmless.The rifles didnt waver, but Captain Yao stepped forward.Welcome aboard the Donnager, she said.Chief, check them.The enlisted man clumped toward them and quickly and professionally patted them all down.He gave the thumbs up to one of the marines.The rifles went down, and Holden worked hard not to sigh with relief.What now, Captain?Holden asked, keeping his voice light.Yao looked Holden over critically for several seconds before answering.Her hair was pulled tightly back, the few strands of gray making straight lines.In person, he could see the softening of age at her jaw and the corners of her eyes.Her stony expression had the same quiet arrogance that all the naval captains hed known shared.He wondered what she saw, looking at him.He resisted the urge to straighten his greasy hair.Chief Gunderson will take you down to your rooms and get you settled in, she replied.Someone will be along shortly to debrief you.Chief Gunderson started to lead them from the room when Yao spoke again, her voice suddenly hard.Mr.Holden, if you know anything about the six ships that are following you, speak now, she said.We gave them a two hour deadline to change course about an hour ago.So far they havent.In one hour Im going to order a torpedo launch.If theyre friends of yours, you could save them a great deal of pain.Holden shook his head emphatically.All I know is they came out of the Belt when you started out to meet us, Captain, Holden said.They havent talked to us.Our best guess is theyre concerned citizens of the Belt coming to watch what happens.Yao nodded.If she found the thought of witnesses disconcerting, it didnt show.Take them below, Chief, she said, then turned away.Chief Gunderson gave a soft whistle and pointed at one of the two doors.Holdens crew followed him out, the marines bringing up the rear.As they moved through the Donnager, Holden took his first really up close look at a Martian capital ship.Hed never served on a battleship in the UN Navy, and hed stepped foot on them maybe three times in seven years, always in dock, and usually for a party.Every inch of the Donnager was just a little sharper than any UN vessel hed served on.Mars really does build them better than we do.Goddamn, XO, they sure do keep their shit squeaky clean, Amos said behind him.Aint much to do on a long flight for most of the crew, Amos, Alex said.So when you arent doin somethin else, you clean.See, thats why I work haulers, Amos said.Clean decks or get drunk and screw, and Ive got a preference.As they walked through a maze of corridors, the ship started a slight vibration, and gravity slowly reappeared.They were under thrust.Holden used his heels to touch his boots slide controls, turning the magnets off.They saw almost no one, and the few they did see moved fast and said little, barely sparing them a glance.With six ships closing on them, everyone would be at their duty stations.When Captain Yao had said shed fire her torpedoes in an hour, there hadnt been a hint of threat in her voice.It was just a flat statement of fact.For most of the young sailors on this ship, it would probably be the first time theyd ever been in a live combat situation if it came to that.Holden didnt believe it would.He wondered what to make of the fact that Yao was prepared to take out a handful of Belt ships just because they were running quiet and close.It didnt suggest that theyd hesitate to kill a water hauler, like the Cant, if they thought there was reason to.Gunderson brought them to a stop in front of a hatch with OQ117 printed on it.He slid a card through the lock and gestured everyone inside.Better than Id expected, Shed said, sounding impressed.The compartment was large by ship standards.It had six high g couches and a small table with four chairs stuck to the deck with magnetic feet.An open door in one bulkhead showed a smaller compartment with a toilet and sink.Gunderson and the marine lieutenant followed the crew inside.This is your rack for the time being, the chief said.Theres a comm panel on the wall.Two of Lieutenant Kellys people will be stationed outside.Buzz them and theyll send for anything you need.How about some chow?Amos said.Well have some sent up.You are to remain here until called for, Gunderson said.Lieutenant Kelly, you have anything to add, sir?The marine lieutenant looked them over.The men outside are there for your protection, but they will react unpleasantly if you make any trouble, he said.You read me?Loud and clear, Lieutenant, Holden said.Dont worry.My people will be the easiest houseguests youve ever had.Kelly nodded at Holden with what seemed like genuine gratitude.He was a professional doing an unpleasant job.Holden sympathized.Also, hed known enough marines to know how unpleasant it could get if they felt challenged.Gunderson said, Can you take Mr.Holden here to his appointment on your way out, El Tee?Id like to get these folks squared away.Kelly nodded and took Holdens elbow.Come with me, sir, he said.Where am I going, Lieutenant?Lieutenant Lopez asked to see you as soon as you landed.Im taking you to him.Shed looked nervously from the marine to Holden and back.Naomi nodded.Theyd all see each other again, Holden told himself.He even thought it was likely to be true.Kelly led Holden at a brisk pace through the ship.His rifle was no longer at the ready but hanging from his shoulder loosely.Either hed decided Holden wasnt going to cause trouble, or that he could take him down easily if he did.
