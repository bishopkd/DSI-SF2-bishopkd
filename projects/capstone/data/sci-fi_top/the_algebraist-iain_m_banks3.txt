The Beyonders were attempting to close, but it was too late.All that the nearest hostile units accomplished was their own destruction.In two minutes the Mercatorial fleet was through without loss, and a minute later its entire fire pattern was rearward: a swirling skirt of crimson lines combing and coning into the emptying depths of space behind.Any further engagement now would be entirely on their terms, and the fleets vastly superior firepower would have the first word, and the last.Nice work, Vice.Fleet Admiral Kisipt sounded a little surprised, a little disappointed and moderately impressed.Taince knew that a lot of her fellow officers had wanted a proper battle, but this way had been better, quicker, more elegant.Nice work  from a Voehn; that was real praise.Sir.Taince kept her thought voice calm, but inside it was her turn to whoop.Submerged in her dark womb of fluid, tubes and wires, her fists clenched, a smile appeared on her until then frowning face, and a little shiver shook her cradled body.* * *  The Kehar family house on Murla, an island off the south coast a few hundred kilometres from Borquille, was another spherical building, a quarter of the size of the Hierchons palace, but remarkable for being balanced on top of a great upthrust of water, precisely like a ball balanced on a water jet in a fairground.Saluus Kehar, perfectly groomed, glowing with health and generally looking as smoothly gleaming as one of his companys spaceships, met Fassin personally on the slim suspension bridge connecting the house with the spit of land jutting out into the ancient drowned caldera where the waters foamed and roared and spumed and the house balanced, barely trembling, on the giant column of water.Fassin!Great to see you!Hey!That uniform suits you!Fassin had thought hed be briefed indoctrinated psyche tested pep talked fuck knows whatted and then bundled aboard ship to be whisked straight to Nasqueron.But even faced with arguably the single greatest emergency in its history, the Ulubine bureaucracy had a set way of doing things, and central to this ethos appeared to be not doing anything too momentous too quickly, just in case.The rest of the session in the Hierchons audience chamber after the AI projection had issued its orders and asked for questions had involved a great deal of talk, speech making, point scoring, back covering, back targeting and pre emptive blame avoidance.The image of Admiral Quile answered all the questions tirelessly and with a patience that was probably the most sure sign possible that it really was an AI talking.A human  especially an admiral, used to being obeyed instantly and without argument  would have lost patience long before the proceedings finally ground to a halt.Fassin had been pointed at and referred to several times, and been left with the distinct impression that this was all his fault.Which, he supposed, in a way it was.It had all gone on so long that Fassins stomach had perhaps in sympathy with a large component of the mood in the chamber  started grumbling.He hadnt eaten since early breakfast on glantine, after all.You are quite sure?the image above the cooking pot device asked eventually, when even the most talkative of those present seemed to have run out of questions to ask and points  and delicate portions of the anatomy  to cover.There was no hint of either pleading or relief in the projections voice.Fassin thought either would have been appropriate.Very well, then.I will bid you farewell, and good luck.The image of the human male with a bald, tattooed scalp and lined face, standing there in his much decorated armoured suit, looked around them one last time, executed a short, formal bow to the Hierchon and disappeared.Nobody seemed to know quite what to do for a moment.Then the black, pot bellied machine in the centre of the floor started to make a loud humming noise.Shrievalty Colonel Somjomion and Cessorian Clerk Regnant Voriel, attending as best they could to the machines they had been put in charge of when the others had been required to leave the chamber, started peering intently at various screens and controls.The circle of mirror armoured troopers each tapped one ear, then brought up their guns, pointing them at the cooking pot device, which was humming loudly now and starting to glow in the infrared.The hum rose and took on extra harmonics, deepening until the machine was visibly vibrating.Some of those close to the device either drew back or looked like they wanted to, as if fearing that the machine was going to explode.The air around its ribbed flanks shimmered.Above it, the atmosphere seemed to writhe and quiver, as though some mutant ghost of the image that had stood there was still fighting to escape.Then, just as the pot bellied thing started to glow a deep cherry red around its midriff, it all faded away: noise and vibration and heat.People relaxed.Somjomion and Voriel took deep breaths and nodded at the Hierchon.The troopers shouldered their arms.Whatever complex substrate inside the dark device had played host to the AI image of the Admiral had been turned to slag.The Hierchon Ormilla spoke from his glittering esuit.I invoke the full emergency powers of the War Emergency Plan.Martial law will be declared at the close of this extended session.Let those earlier excluded resume their places.The flurry of politicking that Fassin had witnessed earlier was made to look mild in comparison as  without actually telling anybody not cleared to know about it any details  what was becoming known as The Current Emergency was talked over and enhanced roles and new responsibilities were discussed, squabbled over  between and within departments  revised, re revised, traded, further discussed and re re revised before finally being handed out.Fassins belly was still making noises when the full session broke up and he was called to a briefing with his superiors in the Shrievalty Ocula.They kept him waiting in an ante room within the Oculas floor inside the Hierchons palace; he shed one layer of his cumbersome court clothes and found some human food in a dispenser in a curving outside corridor with a view over the reception plaza.(Long evening shadows, towers and spires burnished red with sunset.He looked for some obvious sign that the city, planet and system were all under martial law again, but saw nothing. )He was still wiping his fingers when they called him in.Major Taak, Colonel Somjomion said.Welcome.He was shown to a large circular table surrounded by uniformed Shrievalty personnel.They were mostly human or whule, though there were two jajuejein doing their best to look humanoid and seated, and a single oerileithe in a duller and slightly smaller version of the Hierchons esuit, the discus of which was half hidden in a wide slot in the floor.It seemed to radiate chill and dominate the room, all the same.Somjomion indicated the oerileithe.This is Colonel Hatherence, she told Fassin.She will be your superior in this mission.Pleasure, sure, the oerileithe boomed, twisting fractionally towards Fassin.The Colonels esuit had no transparent faceplate like the Hierchons, just armour and sensors, giving no sign of the creature within.Fassin nodded.Maam.Hed thought the only oerileithe in the system apart from the Hierchon were basically Ormillas near family and his girlfriends (harem was, though only just, too pejorative).He wondered whether Colonel Hatherence fitted neatly into either category or not.It was explained to him that they could not, of course, just send him off alone to do what he was supposed to do.Over the next hour, as communications, memos and remote audiences with the Hierchon himself interrupted Somjomion, Fassin was gradually given to understand that the task assigned quite specifically to him alone was one which would nevertheless unar guably be best accomplished if he was escorted and overseen by people the Hierchon and his claque of cohorts felt they could actually trust.Accordingly, Fassin would not be alone on his next delve.He would benefit from the protection and guidance of Colonel Hatherence here, and from that of two of his fellow human Seers, Braam Ganscerel, Chief Seer of the most senior Sept of all, Sept Tonderon, and  as Fassins junior  Paggs Yurnvic of Sept Reheo, with whom he had worked before.Chief Seer Ganscerel was currently readying himself to return as rapidly as possible from a habitat orbiting Quarunze, and would rendezvous with Colonel Hatherence, Major Taak and Seer Yurnvic on Third Fury, from which the delve or delves would be conducted, as soon as possible.Quarunze was the other big gas giant in Ulubis system : there were two smaller examples as well.All had Dweller populations too, though compared to Nasquerons they were negligible in size.Getting Ganscerel from Quarunze to Nasqueron and the Third Fury base would take well over a week, Fassin suspected.The old guy liked his luxuries and anyway wouldnt be physically able to cope with much more than one gee during the journey even if he wanted to.Fassin, very much feeling his way in all this, suddenly caught up within organisations and power structures he never imagined having anything much to do with and having to cope with networks of rank and superiority he had only the vaguest working knowledge of, had been about to start banging the table  probably only figuratively  and complaining about not being able to start the job hed been very clearly ordered to begin as soon as possible.Then they mentioned Ganscerel and his journey back from Quarunze and he saw that there was prob ably no way he was going to be able to move this forward faster than the pace that had already been decided.Which, in a way, suited him fine.If the system really was under threat of imminent invasion and he was being asked to go on the most important delve of his life in the midst of it : and given the amount of time they were being told there was before the invasion took place, there was every likelihood hed still be in planet when it happened  then he wanted  needed  one last delve of his own, into Borquilles underworld, its own hazy, clouded, turbulent and dangerous nether environment.He suddenly had things to do and people, or at least one person, to meet.The delay caused by Ganscerel might work out quite usefully.Of course, they probably wouldnt want to let him out of their sight, so hed have to find a way round that.He also suspected that they wanted the whole delve done at a distance, from Third Fury, with him and Ganscerel and Paggs Yurnvic all lying wired up in the base there and communicating with remotes down in Nasqueron itself.(Certainly Ganscerel wasnt capable of jumping into a gascraft, breathing gillfluid and taking multiple gees, squished in shock gel  he hadnt even done any of that stuff when he was young. )Fassin would have to try and find a way round that, too.He complained as crossly as he could pretend about not being allowed to get on with things, and then demanded some time off.You mean, leave?Somjomion said, goggle eyed.I believe you have some very intense briefing and training ahead of you, Major Taak.Many days worth which will have to be crammed into hours.There is absolutely no time for leave.He explained about Ganscerels age, infirmity and therefore slow rate of travel.Somjomion looked indignant, but checked this, finally having another hurried conference with the Hierchon himself.Indeed, she said, sighing, Chief Seer Ganscerel is profiled as being unable to withstand forces greater than 1.5 gee, and is already complaining at the prospect of that.It will be nine days before he can reach the Third Fury base.Colonel Somjomion narrowed her eyes at Fassin.We shall proceed with your fuller briefing first thing tomorrow, Major Taak.If there is any time left over, a day or two of leave may be granted.I guarantee nothing.So.Another Emergency, Saluus said.He smiled broadly.Tm told I have you to thank for this, Fass.He held out a slim flute.Fassin accepted the glass.Entirely my own work.Sal was, he supposed, one of the few people in the system for whom the prospect of a War Emergency Plan coming into force was genuinely cause for celebration.Really?Saluus said.Youre even more eminent than I thought.And you still look about twenty, you dog.Sal laughed the easy laugh of a man who could afford to be generous with his compliments.Sal chinked glasses.They were drinking champagne; some ancient Krug with a meaningless date all the way from Earth and probably worth as much as a small spaceship.It had a pleasant taste, though not many bubbles.The two men stood on a balcony, looking out over the caldera.The surging waters beneath formed a great frothed slope spreading all around from underneath the house, a shallow cone of billows and hummocks of foam all furiously bunching and collapsing and rushing ever outwards to where the fractious turmoil settled slightly and became merely wildly charging waves.The balcony was just above the equatorial rim of the house so the column of water actually supporting the place was hidden from them, but the crater walls, a couple of kilometres distant, echoed with the tumult.They had climbed up here after a modest reception and light lunch with a few of Sal and his wifes friends  notables all : who were here for the afternoon.Fassin had secured an invitation to stay for a couple of days, until the Shrievalty needed him back in Borquille.He had changed out of his dark grey Shrievalty uniform into casual clothes.Sal leaned back against the barrier.Well, thank you for coming to visit.Fassin nodded.Thank you for inviting me.My pleasure.Just mildly surprised you asked.They trust you, Sal.Fassin gave a small shrug.Ineeded to get away from all that military shit and they wouldnt let me just skip out the door of the palace and into Boogeytown.He looked out at the tumbling waters.Anyway  a glance at Salbeen too long.He wanted to give the impression that this had been a good excuse to effect some sort of reconciliation hed long wanted to make.He and Sal had met up only very occasionally over the two centuries since the wormholes destruction, usually at the sort of gigantic social events it was hard to get out of but easy to remain alone within.They hadnt really talked.Even now, meeting up, there were whole aspects of their lives that somehow didnt need to be gone into.How and what they had each been doing was a matter of public record and it would almost be an insult to inquire.Fassin had recognised Sals wife from news and social images, hadnt really needed introducing.There hadnt been a single person at the reception below, alien or otherwise  servants apart, obviously  about whom Fassin, who was no great social observer, couldnt have written a short biography.Saluus probably didnt know as much about Fassin as vice versa, but hed already congratulated him on his engagement to Jaal Tonderon, so he knew that much (or, more likely perhaps, he just had an efficient social secretary with a good database).So, what can you tell me, Fass?Sal asked casually.He wrinkled his nose.Can you say anything?About the Emergency?Well, about whatevers causing all the fuss.There was more than a fuss; there was low level war.Starting the day after martial law was declared there had been a sequence of attacks, mostly on isolated and system edge craft and settlements, though with some worrying assaults further in system, including one on a Navarchy dock habitat in Sepektes own trailing Lagrange that had killed over a thousand.Nobody knew whether it was Beyonders behind this resurgence of violence, or the E 5 Discon advanced forces, or a mixture of both.More oddly, but for Fassin far more disturbingly, somebody had nuked the High Summer house of Sept Litibiti, back on glantine, just the day before; missiled it from space like it was a military facility.Bizarre and unprecedented.The place had been empty save for a handful of unlucky gardeners and cleaners, keeping the place ticking over until the appropriate season, but it made Seers throughout the system worried that theyd suddenly, for some reason, become targets.Fassin had sent a message to Slovius saying that maybe they should consider shifting the whole Sept elsewhere on glantine.Head for an out of season hotel, perhaps.Hed yet to receive a reply, which might be Slovius ignoring his advice, or just the authorities new message traffic checking and censoring software struggling to cope.Neither would surprise.Tell me what you know, Fassin suggested.Ill fill in what I can.They want lots of warships, Fass.Sal gave a sad looking smile.Lots and lots of warships.Were to turn out as many as we can for as long as we can, though they want them sooner rather than later, and any advanced projects that might take longer than a year, even existing ones, are being deprioritised.Were to gas line a whole bunch of stuff for Sal paused, cleared his throat and waved one hand.Hell, idiot stuff; were to rough cut a whole load of civilian conversions: armed merchantmen, one shot cloud miners, tooled up cruise liners and so on.We didnt even do that in the last Emergency.So whatever it is, its serious, its presumably what our military friends would call credible, and its not very far away.Over to you.Lot I cant tell you, Fassin said carefully.Most of which I guess wouldnt interest you anyway.He wondered how much he could say, how much he needed to say.Supposedly to do with something called the Epiphany Five Disconnect.Sal raised an eyebrow.Hmm.Bit away.Wonder why theyd bother?Richer pickings inward of where they are.But a significant part of the Summed Fleet is on the way.Were told.Fassin grinned.Mm hmm.I see.And what about you?Sal asked, dipping closer to Fassin, voice dropping.Whats your part in all this?Fassin wondered how much the continual rush of noise produced by the waves below would mask their words, if anybody was listening from far away.Since hed arrived hed showered and put on a change of clothes hed requested from the house  caught without the necessary means of attire due to an extended stay away from home, hed explained, needlessly.He got the impression the servants were perfectly used to providing clothes of varying sizes and for whatever sex to house guests.Still, even without the proscribed horror of nanotech, it was possible to make bugs very small indeed these days.Had the Shrievalty or the Hierchons people put some sort of trace or mike on him?Had Sal?Did Sal put surveillance on his guests as a matter of course?His host was waiting for an answer.Fassin looked into the drink.A few small bubbles of gas rose to the surface and broke, giving some tiny proportion of the substance of Earth to the atmosphere of a planet twenty thousand light years away.I just did my job, Sal.Delved, talked, took away what the Dwellers would let me take away.Most of which was not momentous, not important, not going to change anything much at all, not something everybody would want or risk everything for.He looked Saluus Kehar in the eye.Just stumbled my way through life, you know?Over whatever turned up.Never knowing what would lead to what.Whoever does?Sal asked, then nodded.But I see.Sorry I cant really tell you too much more.Sal smiled and looked out at the slope of artificial surf, the pandemonium of waves beyond and the sheer cliffs further away still, brown black beneath a hazy azure sky.Ah, your minder, he said.The esuit of Colonel Hatherence of the Shrievalty appeared to one side, low over the foam, floating out over the mad froth of waters like a great fat grey and gold wheel.Whirling vane sets on either side of her esuit kept the Colonel from sinking into the maelstrom.For all its massive size when you were standing next to it, the esuit looked very small from up here.She giving you any problems?No.Shes okay.Doesnt insist I salute her or call her Maam all the time.Happy to keep things informal.All the same, he was hoping to get the Colonel out of the way somehow, either before or once he got down into Nasqueron.Fassin watched the Colonel as she picked her way across the scape of waves.But can you imagine trying to sneak into Boogeytown with that dogging your every move?he asked.Even just for one last night?Sal snorted.The dives and the ceilings are too low.Fassin laughed.This is like sex, he thought.Well, like the seduction scenario thing, like the whole stupid mating dance of will you wont you, do you dont you rigmarole.Tempting Sal, leading him on  He wondered if hed seemed sufficiently mysterious yet hinted at maybe being available.He needed this man.Dinner with Sal, his wife, their concubines and some business associates, including  amongst the latter  a whule, a jajuejein and a quaup.The talk was of new attacks on distant outposts, martial law, delays in comms, restrictions in travel and who would gain and who would lose from the new Emergency (nobody on any of the couches seemed to anticipate losing more than a few trivial freedoms for a while).Colonel Hatherence sat silent in one corner, needing no external sustenance, thank you, but happy, indeed honoured, to be there while they consumed nourishment, communicated conversationally and intercoursed socially while she continued her studies (much needed!), screening up on Nasqueron and its famous Dwellers.Drinks, semi narcotic foods, drug bowls.A human acrobat troupe entertained them, floodlit beyond the dining rooms balcony.No, Im serious!Sal shouted at his guests, gesturing at the acrobats, swinging through the air on ropes and trapezes.If they fall they almost certainly die!So much air in the water you cant float.Sink right down.Get caught up in the under turbulence.No, idiot!Sal told his wife.Not enough air to breathe!Some people left.Drinks later, just the humans.To Sals trophy room, corridors and rooms too small, sorry, for Colonel Hatherence (not minding; so to sleeping; good nights!).Sals wife, going to bed, and the remaining few.Soon just the two of them, overlooked by the stuffed, lacquered, dry shrunk or encased heads of beasts from dozens of planets.You saw Taince?Just before the portal went?Dinner.Day or two before.Equatower.Fassin waved in what might have been the general direction of Borquille.You could see the lights of the Equatower from the house, a thin stipple of red climbing into the sky, sometimes perversely clearer above when the lower atmosphere was hazed and the higher beacons shone down at a steeper angle through less air.She okay?Sal asked, then threw his head back and laughed too loudly.As though it matters.It was two centuries ago.Still  Anyway, she was fine.Good.They drank their drinks.Cognac.Also from Earth, long, long ago.Far, far away.Fassin got swim.Oh shit, he said, Ive got Swim.Swim?said Saluus.Swim, Fassin said.You know; when your head kind of seems to swim because you suddenly think, Hey, Im a human being but Im twenty thousand light years from home and were all living in the midst of mad shit aliens and super weapons and the whole fucking bizarre insane swirl of galactic history and politics!That: isnt it weird?And thats what?Swing?Swirl?Sal said, looking genuinely confused.No, Swim!Fassin shouted, not able to believe that Sal hadnt heard of this concept.He thought everybody had.Some people  most people, come to think of it, or so hed been told  never got Swim, but lots did.Not just humans, either.Though Dwellers, mind you, never.Wasnt even in their vocabulary.Never heard of it, Sal confessed.Well, didnt imagine you might have.Hey, you want to see something?Whatever it is, I cannot fucking wait.Come with me.Last time I heard that  We agreed no more of those.Fuck!So we did.Total retraction.Show me what you got to show me.Walk this way.Ah now, just fuck off.Fassin followed Sal through to the inner recess of his study.It was kind of what he might have expected if hed given the matter any thought: lots of wood and softly glowing pools of light, framed stuff and a desk the size of a sunken room.Funny looking twisted bits of large and gleaming metal or some other shiny substance sitting in one corner.Fassin guessed these were starship bits.There.Where?What am I supposed to be looking at?This.Sal held up a very small twisted looking bit of metal mounted on a wooden plinth.Fassin tried very hard not to let his shiver show.He was nothing like as drunk as he was trying to appear to be.Yeah?An whassat?(Overdoing it, but Sal didnt seem to notice. )Saluus held the piece of odd looking metal up before Fassins eyes.This is that thing I got out of that fucking downed ship, my man.Sal looked at it, swallowed and took a deep breath.Fassin saw Sals lip tremble.This is what  The fuckers going to break down, Fassin thought.He slapped one hand on Sals shoulder.This is no good, he told him.We need different, we need, I dont know; something.We need not this, not what is before us here.We need something different.Elsewhen or elsestuff or elsewhere.This might be my last night of freedom, Sal.He gripped the other man hard by the shoulder of his perfectly tailored jacket.Im serious!You dont know how bad things might get for me!Oh fuck, Sal, you dont know how bad things might get for all of us, and I cant fucking tell you, and this could be my last night of fun anywhere, and and and youre showing me some fucking coat hook or something, and I dont know He swiped weakly at the twisted piece of metal, patting it away and still missing.Then he sniffed and drew himself up.Sorry, he said, soberly.Sorry, Sal.He patted the other mans shoulder.But this is maybe my last, ah, night of fun, and look, I feel totally charged for anything  wish Boogeytown was right outside, really do, but on the other hand its been a long few days and maybe  no, not maybe.Maybe definitely.In fact, not that, just plain definitely the sensible thing to do is just go to bed and  You serious?Sal said, dropping the metal piece on its wooden plinth onto the desk behind him.About sleep?Fassin said, gesturing wildly.Well, it     No, you moron!About Boogeytown!What?Eh?I didnt mention Boogeytown!Yes, you did!Sal said, laughing.I did?Well, fuck!Sal had a flier.Automatic to the point of being nearly banned under the AI laws.Loaded with repair mechanisms that were not quite nanotech but only by such a tiny tiny tiny little bit.Deeply civilian but with total military clearance.If a Grand Fleet Admiral of the Summed Fucking Fleet stepped into this baby and toggled his authority it would only decrease the fuckers all areas, multi volumes access profile.Down in the hangar deck.Walk this way, har har.They left the top down part of the way, to clear their heads.It was very, very cold.They set down somewhere where litter blew about under the fans of the flier.Fassin hadnt thought there was still such a thing as litter.Boogeytown was much as he remembered it.They hit the lows, looking for highs.They trawled the bowl bars and narctail parlours, coming up with a brimming catch of buzz and girls, Fassin meanwhile trying to edge Sal in a certain bars direction, while Sal  vaguely recalling this wasnt supposed to be just fun but also a way of getting his old pal Fass to open up with more potentially useful and lucrative details about whatever the fuck was going on  tried to get his old new best buddy to move in a certain informational direction but without much success and anyway with decreasing amounts of concern and an increasing feeling of oh who gives a fuck?Fassin too was getting frustrated, still angling for one more move and one particular streetlet, one particular bar, but they were here now in this diamond walled emporium called the Narcateria where the sleaze was so coolly glitz it almost hurt, surrounded by people who hadnt seen Sal in so long and just had to keep him where he was, dont you dare go away, you wicked man you!And is this your friend?Where you been keeping him?Can I sit here, hmm?Me too me too!So eventually he had to stumble away and make a call in a private public booth and then head for the toilet where he threw up in a thin burning stream all the alcohol hed drunk since the last time hed been to the loo (over the hole, so it looked and sounded authentic), then wash his face and rejoin the drunken stoned out fray of breath catching loveliness, waiting for the right girl, the one all this had been about, all of it: asking to go to Sals in the first place, then getting him drunk and seeming to get drunk himself (which he was, but not that drunk) and then dropping hints about Boogeytown, all so that he could get away and get here and see this one particular girl   Who finally appeared nearly an hour later when he was just starting to despair but there she was, perfect and calm and quietly beautiful as ever, though looking quite different, again, with white gold hair swinging heavy as the real 24 carat article about her near triangular face, chin just made for holding, strawberry bruise lips for kissing, tiny little nose for nuzzling, cheeks for stroking, eyes for gazing into (depths, ah, depths!)brows for licking, forehead for licking too, licking dry of sex sweat after  oo!oo!oo!just too strenuous a session!Aun Liss.The one real love of his life, his controlling passion.Older again but not as old as she should be.Looking different, living different, being different, called different.Called Ko now (and that was all), not Aun Liss, but she would always be Aun Liss to him.No need to say her real name.A lot of what passed between them wasnt said anyway.Dressed in salarygirl clothes.Nothing special, revealing or provocative.Nevertheless.She held out her hand.Nearby, surrounded by  actually, nearly drowning in  utter human female and super stimulus hyper pulchritude loveli nessence, even Sal looked impressed.Fass, you dog!Aun Liss was still holding out her hand.Back in Sals flier.Sal was in the front, being grievously attended to by the infamous Segrette Twins, moaning.Fassin and Aun in the back seat, utterly happy to appear so archetypical.They kissed for a long time, then  looking round, shrugging at the front seat antics (the flier at this point not really going anywhere, circling in a holding pattern  a clinching pattern, Aun Liss suggested)  she rose up and straddled him, his hands up underneath the light dress she wore, fingers still kneading her back as they continued to do once they were finally returned to the idiot Kehar house poised over the column of water just as, Aun pointed out, she was poised over his column.(This aloud, for the benefit of anybody listening.They both laughed, not too loudly, he hoped. )Meanwhile she kept the dress on still, even in the heat of it, with his fingers pressing, kneading, moving above her arched spine producing little half pained gasps until later when they were finally just lying together under a thin sheet she shucked off the dress and he just held her.And this is what, over the course of those several hours, their fingers said, drawing and tapping out the private, effectively unbuggable code they had used for hundreds of years, since she first became his control, his link:  U STILL MY CNNECTN?They were in the private booth deep inside the Narcateria, just kissing.She slid her hands between his jacket and shirt, knuckled back, YS.WOT U GOT 4 I?1ST,

going to watch the bad machine being killed.He put his hands over Uncle Sloviuss forehead and got him to crinkle it, which felt funny and made him squirm and wriggle and laugh and meant Uncle Slovius had to hold his ankles tight to stop him falling off.Fass, stop wriggling.I fine, honest.He already knew you were supposed to say, Im fine, or, I am fine, but saying things like I fine was better because it made adults smile and sometimes hug.Sometimes it made them put a hand on your head and make a mess of your hair, but never mind.They went through the port door.It was spring and so that was the house they were in.He was big.Hed lived in all the houses except the Summer House.That one came next.Then he would have lived in them all.Then you started again.That was how it worked.Uncle Slovius ducked as they went through the doorway so he didnt bash his head.Umm, mind your head, he heard his dad say quietly somewhere behind him.His mum sighed.Oh, stop fussing.Dear.He couldnt see his mum and dad because they were behind him and Uncle Slovius but he could hear them.Look, I wasnt fussing, I was just  Yes, you  He got that funny feeling in his tummy he got when Mum and Dad talked like that.He did a slap a slap slap on Uncle Sloviuss forehead and said, More about history!More about history!as they walked down to the flier.Uncle Slovius laughed.The shake came up through Uncle Sloviuss shoulders into his bottom and whole body.My, we are a keen student.One word for it, his mother said.Oh, come on, his dad said.The boys just inquisitive.Yes, yes, youre right, his mum said.You could hear her breath through her words.My mistake.Pardon me for expressing an opinion.Oh, now, look, I didnt mean  More about Voerin!Voehn, Uncle Slovius said.Ive got a Voerin!Ive got a big one that talks and climbs and swims and jumps or can walk under the water too.Its got a gun that shoots other toys.And Ive got lots of little ones that just move.Theyve got guns too but theyre a bit small to see but they can make each other fall over.Ive nearly a hundred.I watch Attack Squad Voerin all the time!My favourite is Captain Chunce cos hes clever.I like Commander Saptpanuhr too and Corporal Qump cos hes funny.Jun and Yoze both like Commander Saptpanuhr best.Theyre my friends.Do you watch Attack Squad Voerin, Uncle Slovius?Cant say Ive ever caught it, Fass.Fassin frowned, thinking.He decided this probably meant No.Why didnt adults just say no when they meant no?They sat in the flier.He had to come down off Uncle Sloviuss shoulders but he got to sit beside him in the front.He didnt even need to tell people hed be sick if he sat in the back any more.A servant sat on the other side of him.Great uncle Fimender was behind with two old ladies who were girlfriends.He was laughing and they were too.His mum and dad were further back, talking quiet.His mum and dad were old but Uncle Slovius was really old and Great uncle Fimender was really, really old.The flier went up into the air and went through the air making a noise like the Attack ship Avenger did in Attack Squad Voerin.His model of the Attack ship Avenger flew but only in Supervised Areas Outdoors and shot guns and missiles and made the same noise.Hed wanted to bring it with him, but not been allowed, even after hed shouted.He hadnt been allowed to bring any toys.No toys at all!He pulled at Uncle Sloviuss sleeve.Tell me about the Voerin!He tried to think what had made Uncle Slovius laugh.More about history!Uncle Slovius smiled.The Voehn are the Culminas bully boys, child, said Great uncle Fimender from the seat behind.He was leaning over.His breath had that funny sweet smell like it usually did.Great uncle Fimender was fond of a drink.His voice was funny also sometimes, like all the words were sort of one big word.I wouldnt fixate too enthusiastically on the scum that stole our species birthright.Steady, now, Fim, Uncle Slovius said.He looked round at Great uncle Fimender but looked first at the servant except the servant didnt move or look back or anything.If the wrong person took you seriously you might find yourself joining this rogue AI.Hmm?He made a smile at Great uncle Fimender, who sat back again in the seat between the old lady girlfriends and took a glass with a drink in it from a picnic tray.Be an honour, he said in a quiet voice.Uncle Slovius smiled down at Fass.The Voehn went to Earth a long, long time ago, Fassin.Before humans made spaceships  before they made sea ships, almost.How long ago?About eight thousand years ago.4051BCE, Great uncle Fimender said, though only just loud enough to hear.Uncle Slovius didnt seem to hear.Fassin wasnt sure if Great uncle Fimender was disagreeing with Uncle Slovius or not.Fassin stored 4051 BCE away as an Important Number anyway.They met human people on Earth, Uncle Slovius said, and took them away with them on their ship, to other stars and planets.Kidnapping the prims!Great uncle Fimender said.Sampling the barbs, with prejudice!Eh?He didnt sound like he was talking to him and Uncle Slovius.Fass didnt understand what Great uncle Fimender was saying anyway.The old lady girlfriends were laughing.Well, Uncle Slovius said, with a small smile, whos to say whether humans were kidnapped or not?People in ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia and China were too primitive to know what was going on.They probably thought the Voehn were gods, so they might have gone with them without being kidnapped and we dont even know that the Voehn took whole people.Maybe they just took their cells.Or babies, or foetuses, or excised a few thousand fertilised eggs, Great uncle Fimender said.Then, Oh, thank you, my dear.Oops!Steady, there.In any event, Uncle Slovius said, the Voehn took some human people and put them down on planets far away from Earth and the human people grew up with other people, and the Culmina had the other people help the humans so that they became civilised quickly, and invented all the things humans back on Earth ever invented, but these human people on the other planets always knew they were part of a galactic community, hmm?Uncle Slovius looked at him with a question look on his face.Fass nodded quickly.He knew what a galactic community meant: everybody else.Anyway, people on Earth kept on inventing things, and eventually invented wormholes and portals  The Attack ship Avenger goes through wormholes and portals, he told Uncle Slovius.Of course, Uncle Slovius said.And so when human people went out and met other alien people and joined their worm hole up with everybody elses wormhole, they found out that they werent the first humans the alien people had met or had heard of, because the humans who had been taken away to the other planets by the Voehn were already quite well known.Remainder humans, Great uncle Fimender said from the seat behind.His voice sounded funny, like he might be going to burst out laughing or something.Uncle Slovius looked round at him for a short bit.Well, the terms dont matter too much, even if they might sound a little harsh sometimes.Carefully chosen to keep us in our place, remind us we owe them, either way, Great uncle Fimender said.The Culmina tell us they had people look after Earth after the Voehn took the humans away to the other stars.They made sure that nothing bad happened to Earth, like it being hit by a big rock.Great uncle Fimender made a sort of cough laugh.Easy to claim.Fass looked round at Great uncle Fimender.He sort of wanted Great uncle Fimender to be quiet so he could listen to Uncle Slovius but sort of didnt because the things Great uncle Fimender was saying, even if he didnt always understand all of them, seemed to be saying things about the things Uncle Slovius was saying.It was like they sort of agreed and didnt agree at the same time.Great uncle Fimender winked at him and gestured towards Uncle Slovius with his glass.No, no; listen!So, people from Earth got into the stars at last and found that there were aliens everywhere, Uncle Slovius told him.And some of them were us!He smiled a broad smile.And there were a lot more of the alien humans than there were of the ones who thought they were humanity, Great uncle Fimender said.It sounded like he was sneering.Uncle Slovius sighed and looked ahead.The flier was flying over mountains with snow on them.In front was a big bit of desert like a circle.Uncle Slovius shook his head and didnt seem to want to say anything but Great uncle Fimender did so Fass turned round in his seat and listened to him.And they were more technically advanced, these so called aHumans.Advanced but cowed.Servant species, just like everybody else.While all Earths dreams of wild expansion were made to look like so much belly gas.The answer to Where is everybody?turned out to be, Everywhere, but the stake at the galactic poker game is a wormhole and so we had to fund our own and bring that to the table.Then discover that Everywhere really meant Everywhere, and every damn thing you could see and every damn thing you couldnt belonged to some bugger: every rock, every planet, moon and star, every comet, dust cloud and dwarf, even the bloody null foam of space itself was somebodys home.Land on some godforsaken cinder, pull out a shovel thinking you could dig something, build something or make something of it and next thing you know an alien with two heads was poking both of them out of a burrow and telling you to fuck off, or pointing a gun at you.Or a writ  ha!Worse still!Hed never heard Great uncle Fimender talk so much.He wasnt sure that Great uncle Fimender was really talking to Uncle Slovius or to him or even to his two old lady girlfriends because he wasnt looking at any of them, he was looking at the picnic table hinged down from the seat in front, maybe looking at the glass and the decanter bottle on it, and looking sad.The two old lady girlfriends patted him and one smoothed his hair which was very black indeed but still looked old.Prepping, they call it, he said, maybe to himself or maybe to the picnic table.Bloody kidnapping.He snorted.Putting people in their place, holding them there.Letting us build our dreams then puncturing them.He shook his head, and drank from his shiny glass.Prepping?Fass asked, to make sure he had the word right.Hmm?Oh, yes.Well, its something thats gone on for as long as anybody can remember, Uncle Slovius said.He sounded gentle, and Fass wasnt sure if Uncle Slovius was talking to him or to Great uncle Fimender.He sort of half listened while he pulled out one of the fliers screens.If hed been allowed to bring any toys hed definitely have brought his BotPal and just asked, but now these damn adults were making him use a screen.He stared at the letters and numbers and things (Uncle Slovius and Great uncle Fimender were still talking).He didnt want to have to talk, he wanted to tap in like adults did.He tried a few buttons.After a while he got a lots of books symbol with a big kid standing next to it and an ear symbol.The big kid looked scruffy and was holding a drug bowl and his head was surrounded with lines and little moving satellites and flying birds.Oh well.Prepping, he said, but pressed Text.The screen said:  Prepping.A very long established practice, used lately by the Culmina amongst others, is to take a few examples of a pre civilised species from their home world (usually in clonoclastic or embryonic form) and make them subject species\slaves\mercenaries\mentored so that when the people from their home world finally assume the Galactic stage, they are not the most civilised\advanced of their kind (often theyre not even the most numerous grouping of their kind).Species so treated are expected to feel an obligation to their so called mentors (who will also generally claim to have diverted comets or otherwise prevented catastrophes in the interim, whether they have or not).This practice has been banned in the past when pan Galactic laws (see Galactic Council) have been upheld but tends to reappear in less civilised times.Practice variously referred to as Prepping, Lifting or Aggressive Mentoring.Local relevant terminology: aHuman rHuman (advanced and remainder Human).And that was just the start.He scratched his head.Too many long words.And this wasnt even an adult pedia.Maybe he should have found the not so big kids site.They were landing.Wow!He hadnt even noticed they were near the ground.The desert was covered with fliers of different sizes and there were lots in the air too and lots of people.They got out and walked across the sand though a lot of people stayed in their fliers.He got to go on Uncle Sloviuss shoulders again.Away in the distance in the centre of a big circle was a tower with a big blob on top and that was where the bad machine was which had been found hiding in a cave in the mountains and caught by the Cessoria.(The Cessoria and the Lustrals caught bad machines.Hed tried watching Lustral Patrol a few times but it was too much for old people with talk and kissing. )The bad machine in the blob on top of the big tower was allowed to make a speech but it was too full of long words.He was getting bored and it was very hot.No toys!Uncle Slovius said Shush at him, twice.He sort of tried to pretend strangle Uncle Slovius with his thighs and knees to get back at him for going Shush twice, but Uncle Slovius didnt seem to notice.Mum and Dad were still talking quietly, rolling their eyes and shaking their heads at each other as usual.Great uncle Fimender and the two old lady girlfriends had stayed in the flier.Then Lustrals in a flier  humans and a whule like a big grey bat  said things, then at last it was time and the bad machine was killed but even that wasnt very good, the blob on top of the tower just went red and made lots of smoke and then there was a big bright flash but not that big or bright and then there was a bang and bits fell down, with smoke, and some people cheered but mostly there was silence, just the bang being an echo round the mountains.When they got back to the flier Great uncle Fimender had very red eyes and said in his opinion they had just seen a terrible crime committed.* * *  Ah, young Taak.Now then, what is this nonsense about not being able to delve properly, by which of course one means remotely?Braam Ganscerel, Chief Seer of Sept Tonderon and therefore the most senior Seer of all  and Fassins future paterfamilias in law  was tall and thin and maned in white hair.He looked younger than he was, but then he was nearly seventeen hundred years old by the most obvious way of reckoning such matters.He had a sharp, angular face with a large nose, his skin was pale, waxy and translucent and his fingers and hands were long and fragile seeming.He habitually walked and stood with his head back and chest out, as though he had long ago vowed not to appear stooped as he grew into great old age and had gone too far in the other direction.This curious stance meant that his head was angled so far back on his neck that he had no choice but to look down his splendidly monumental nose at those he talked with, to or at.He held two long shining black staffs as though just returned from  or about to set off for  some particularly fashionable ski slopes.With his long, bunned white hair, pale complexion and simple but elegantly cut Seer robes  black puttees, pantaloons and long jacket  he contrived to look appealingly frail, sweetly elderly, breathtakingly distinguished and only a little less authoritative than a supreme deity.He swept into the senior officers mess of the heavy cruiser Pyralis in a clatter of clicks from his twin staffs and boot heels, attended by a pale train of half a dozen junior Seers  half of them men, half of them women, all of them greyly deferential  and, bringing up the rear, the gangly, smiling form of Paggs Yurnvic, a Seer whom Fassin had helped teach but who, having spent less time subsequently in the slowness of actual delving than Fassin had, was now older in both adjusted time and appearance.Chief Seer, Fassin said, standing and executing a formal nod that just avoided being a bow.The heavy cruiser was taking their party to Third Fury, the close orbit moon of Nasqueron from which they would delve  either all remotely, or, if Fassin had his way, through a combination of remote and direct presences.Braam Ganscerel had insisted that his years and frailty made a high gee journey to the moon out of the question  esuits, life pods and shock gel notwithstanding  and so the ship was making a gentle standard one gee, creating what felt like about twice glantines gravity and a fraction less than Sepektes.Even this standard gee, Braam Ganscerel let it be known, necessitated that he use both his staffs to support himself.This was, however, in the current grave circumstances, a sacrifice he felt it was only right and proper and indeed required that he make.Fassin thought it made him look like a stilter, like a whule.Well?the Chief Seer demanded, stopping in front of Fassin.Why cant you remote delve, Fassin?Whats wrong with you?Fear, sir, Fassin told him.Fear?Braam Ganscerel seemed to experiment with putting his head even further back than it already was, found it was possible, and left it there.Fear of being shown up by you, sir, as a merely competent Slow Seer.Braam Ganscerel half closed one eye.He looked at Fassin for a while.Youre mocking me, Fassin.Fassin smiled.I delve better direct, Braam.You know that.I do, Ganscerel said.He turned with a sort of staccato grace and let himself flop into the couch where Fassin had been sitting, watching screen news.Fassin sat too.Paggs perched on one arm of the next nearest couch and the rest of Braam Ganscerels retinue sited themselves nearby according to some arcane pecking order.Fassin nodded at Paggs.Seer Yurnvic, he said with a smile and a formality he hoped Paggs wouldnt take seriously.Paggs grinned.Good to see you, Fass.That was all right, then.However, we must do this together, I believe, Braam Ganscerel said, looking ahead at the wall screen, where the news went silently on.The funerals were taking place of some more of the Navarchy people whod died in the attack on the dock habitat at Sepektes trailing Lagrange.Ganscerel had let one of his twin staffs rest on the couch beside him, but still held the other.He waved it at the screen and it obligingly went back to being a bulkhead again.The heavy cruisers senior officers mess was a large space, but much broken up by vertical columns and diagonal reinforcing struts.Like the rest of the vessel it was quite comfortable by human standards, though Colonel Hatherence had had to be content with a cabin that was extremely cramped for an oerileithe.She had been offered passage on an escorting cruiser with more suitable accommodation but had declined.We can be together, Fassin said.You and Paggs remotely, the Colonel and I directly.That way were backed up so if anything happens to either group  Ah, Ganscerel said.You see, young Taak, this is the point.If we are all on Third Fury, with this fine vessel and its escort craft to protect us, we shall all be safe.You wish to take a tiny gascraft into the unending violence of the planets atmosphere.A dangerous enterprise at the best of times.In wartime, positively foolhardy.Braam, the old portal was protected by an entire fleet and it still got blasted.Third Fury might move, but it moves very predictably.If somebody did want to attack it they could accelerate a small rock to just under light speed and send it on an intercept course.If that happens, the only way a heavy cruiser is going to help is if by some million to one chance it happens to be in the way at the time and takes the hit itself.As nobodys going to surround the entire moon with a shell of ships, I think its unwise to rely on a few war craft to protect us from something theres almost no defence against.Why would anybody target a moonlet like Third Fury?Paggs asked.Indeed, Ganscerel said, as though he had been just about to ask that very question.No good reason, Fassin said.But then a lot of places theres been no good reason to hit have been getting attacked recently.This might well include Nasqueron itself, Ganscerel pointed out.Which can absorb a lot more punishment than Third Fury.You might still be targeted.If Im in there in a gascraft, even with Colonel Hatherence riding shotgun, I should be effectively untraceable, Fassin told them.Unless, Paggs said, shes supposed to be in constant touch with her superiors.And that might be the real reason we are all expected to stay together on Third Fury, delving remotely, Ganscerel said, sighing.He looked at Fassin.Control.Or at least the illusion of it.Our masters are fully aware how important this mission is, even if they think themselves for the moment above explaining its precise nature to all who need to know.They are naturally terrified that if it goes wrong some of the blame will stick to them.Really, it is all up to us: a bunch of academics theyve never particularly cared about or for, even though   Ganscerel looked round the assembled junior Seers   being a centre of Dweller Studies represents the only thing which makes Ulubis in any way remarkable.He directed his gaze on Fassin again.There is very little they can do, therefore they will attend with extreme diligence to what trivial matters they are able to affect.With us all apparently safe on Third Fury protected by a small fleet of warships, they will feel they are doing all they can to assist us.If they let you go down into Nasqueron, and something does go wrong, they will be blamed.In that they are right.It wont work, Braam.I think we have to try, the older man said.Look.He patted Fassins arm.Fassin was dressed in his Shrievalty majors uniform and feeling awkward amidst fellow Seers.Have you tried remote delving recently?Not for a long time, Fassin admitted.Its changed, Paggs said, nodding.Its much more lifelike, if you know what I mean; more convincing.Paggs smiled.There have been a lot of improvements over the last couple of centuries.Largely thanks to the Real Delving movement, frankly.Oh, Paggs, flattery?Fassin thought.Ganscerel patted his arm again.Just try it, will you, Fassin?Will you do that for me?Fassin didnt want to say yes immediately.This is all beside the point, he thought.Even if I didnt know there was a potential threat to Third Fury, the argument that matters is that the Dwellers we need to talk to just wont take us seriously if we turn up in remotes.Its about respect, about us taking risks, sharing their world with them, really being there.But he mustnt seem intransigent.Keep some arguments back; always have reserves.After a moment he nodded slowly.Very well.Ill do that.But only as a trial delve.A day or two.Thatll be enough to feel any difference.Then we have to make a final decision.Ganscerel smiled.They all did.They had a very pleasant dinner with the senior officers of the small fleet taking them to Third Fury.Fassin got Ganscerel alone at one point.Chief Seer, he said.I will do this remote delve, but if I feel its not good enough Im going to have to insist on going direct.He gave Ganscerel space to say something, but the old man just looked him in the eye, head thrown back.I do have authority, Fassin continued.From the briefing, from Admiral Quile and the Complector Council.I realise its been compromised by people in system coming to their own conclusions about the best way to tackle this problem, but if I think I need to, Ill go as high and wide as I can to get my way.Ganscerel thought for a while, then smiled.Do you think this delve  or delves, this mission  will be successful?No, Chief Seer.Neither do I.  However, we must make the attempt and do all we can to make it successful, even so, and even though failure is probably guaranteed.We must be seen to do what we can, attempt not to offend those above us, and aim to protect the good name and the future prospects of the Slow Seers in general.These things we can definitely do.You agree?So far, yes.If you genuinely believe that you must delve directly, I shall not stand in your way.I shall not back you, either, because to do that in my position would be to tie myself too directly to a course of action I still regard as fundamentally foolhardy.In any other set of circumstances I would simply order you to do as your most senior Chief Seer tells you to do.However, you have been instructed from on high  from extremely on high  Fassin Taak, and that does alter things somewhat.However.Try this remote delve.You might be surprised.Then make your own mind up.I wont stand in your way.The responsibility will be entirely yours.You have my full support in that.With a wink, Ganscerel turned away to talk to the heavy cruisers captain.Fassin reflected that being given full support had never felt so much like being hung out to dry.The Pyralis blazed with its own trailed aurora as it entered the protective magnetombra of Third Fury, a little twenty kilometre wide ball of rock and metal orbiting just 120,000 kilometres above Nasquerons livid cloud tops.The gas giant filled the sky, so close that its rotund bulk took on the appearance of a vast wall, its belts and zones of tearing, swirling, ever eddying clouds looking like colossal contra rotating, planet wide streams of madly coloured liquid caught whirling past each other under perfectly transparent ice.Third Fury had no appreciable atmosphere and only the vaguest suggestion of gravity.The heavy cruiser could almost have docked directly with the Seer base complex on the side of the little moon which always faced Nasqueron.However, a troop landing craft took them from one to the other.The Pyralis lay a few kilometres off, effectively another temporary satellite of the gas giant.Its escort of two light cruisers and four destroyers took up station a few tens of kilometres further out in a complicated cats cradle of nested orbits around the moon, slim slow shadow shapes only glimpsed when they passed in front of the planets banded face.Third Fury had been constructed, or converted, from an already existing moonlet, billions of years earlier, by one of the first species to pay homage at the court of the Nasqueron Dwellers.Given that Dwellers were the most widespread of the planet based species of the galaxy, with a presence in almost all gas giants  themselves the most common type of planets  the fact that out of those ninety million plus Dweller inhabited super globes there were exactly eight with populations willing to play host to those wishing to carry on more than the most fleeting conversation with their inhabitants spoke volumes  indeed, appropriately, libraries  about their almost utter lack of interest in the day to day life of the rest of the galactic community.It was, though, only almost utter; the Dwellers were not perfectly anything, including reclusive.They sought, gathered and stored vast quantities of information, albeit with no discernible logical system involved in the acquisition or the storage, and when quizzed on the matter seemed not only completely unable to present any obvious or even obscure rationale for this effectively mindless accumulation of data, but even genuinely puzzled that the question should be asked at all.There had also, throughout recorded time  even discounting the notoriously unreliable records kept on such matters by the Dwellers themselves  always been a few of their populations available for discourse and informational trading, though this was invariably only granted on the eccentric and capricious terms of the Dwellers.Since the end of the First Diasporian Age, when the galaxy and the universe were both around two and a half billion years old, there had never been no working centres of Dwellers Studies, but in the following ten and a half billion years there had never been more than ten such centres operating at any one time either.Acceptable companions came and went.The Dwellers were of the Slow, the category of species that stuck around in a civilised form for at least millions of years.The people they let come and visit them and talk to them, and with whom they were prepared to trade information, were usually numbered amongst the Quick, the kind of species that often counted its time as a civilised entity in tens of thousands of years, and sometimes not even that long.The Dwellers would tolerate and talk to other Slow species as well, though normally on a less regular and frequent basis.The suspicion was that the Dwellers, for all their fabled patience  no species colonised the galaxy at speeds averaging less than one per cent of the speed of light (not counting stopovers) unless it was supremely patient  could get bored with the species that came to talk to them, and by selecting only those numbered amongst the Quick they ensured that they would never have to endure for too long a time the attentions of people they only looked forward to seeing the back of.Just wait a bit and  in a twinkling of an eye by Dweller standards  their troublesome guests would evolve out of nuisancehood.For the last sixteen hundred years or so  barely half a Dweller eye twinkling  humans had been adjudged as acceptable confidants for the Dwellers of Nasqueron in the system of Ulubis, their presence mostly tolerated, their company usually accepted, their safety almost always guaranteed and their attempts to talk to the Dwellers and mine their vast but defiantly imaginatively organised and indexed data shales met with only the most formal of obstructiveness, the lighter forms of derision and the least determinedly obfuscatory strategies.That such playful coynesses, such nearly too small to measure diffidences and such gentle, barely meriting the name hindrances appeared to the humans concerned to be obstacles of monumental scale, hideous complexity and inexhaustibly fiendish invention just went to show whod been doing this for most of the lifetime of the universe and who for less than two thousand years.Other approaches had, of course, been tried.Bribing creatures who found the concept of money merely amusing tended to tax even the most enterprising and talented arbitrageur.The Dwellers clove to a system in which power was distributed, well, more or less randomly, it sometimes seemed, and authority and influence depended almost entirely on ones age; little leverage there.Alternatively, every now and again a species would attempt to take by force of arms what those involved in Dweller Studies attempted to wrest from the Dwellers by polite but dogged inquiry.Force, it had been discovered  independently, amazingly often  did not really work with Dwellers.They felt no pain, held their own continued survival (and that of others, given the slightest provocation) to be of relatively little consequence and seemed to embody, apparently at the cellular level, the belief that all that really mattered, ever, was a value unique to themselves which they defined as a particular kind of kudos, one of whose guiding principles appeared to be that if any outside influence attempted to mess with them they had to resist it to the last breath in the bodies of all concerned, regardless.Dwellers were almost everywhere and had been there practically for ever.They had learned a few things about making war over that time, and while their war machines were believed to be as customarily unreliable  and eccentrically designed, built and maintained  as every other piece of technology they deigned to involve themselves with, that didnt mean they werent deadly; usually for all concerned, and within a disconcertingly large volume.Other species had prevailed against Dwellers on occasion.Entire planetary populations of them had been wiped out and whole gas giants dismantled to provide the raw material for one of those monstrous megastructure projects that Quick species in particular seemed so keen on building, apparently just because they could.But the long term results were, to date, inevitably unhappy.Picking a fight with a species as widespread, long lived, irascible and  when it suited them  single minded as the Dwellers too often meant that just when  or even geological ages after when  you thought that the dust had long since settled, bygones were bygones and any unfortunate disputes were all ancient history, a small planet appeared without warning in your home system, accompanied by a fleet of moons, themselves surrounded with multitudes of asteroid sized chunks, each of those riding cocooned in a fuzzy shell made up of untold numbers of decently hefty rocks, every one of them travelling surrounded by a large landslides worth of still smaller rocks and pebbles, the whole ghastly collection travelling at so close to the speed of light that the amount of warning even an especially wary and observant species would have generally amounted to just about sufficient time to gasp the local equivalent of What the fu?before they disappeared in an impressive if wasteful blaze of radiation.Retaliation, where it was still possible, and on the few occasions it had been tried, led without fail towards a horribly messy war of attrition, whereupon the realisation of the sheer scale of the Dweller civilisation (if one could even call it that) and its past  and therefore probably future  longevity more often than not had a sobering effect on whatever species had been unwise enough to set themselves against the Dwellers in the first place.Attempting to hold your local Dweller population hostage in the hope of influencing another one  or a group of others  was an almost laughably lame and even counter productive strategy.Dwellers of any given gas giant thought little enough of their own collective safety; giving them an excuse to show how little solidarity they felt with any other group of their own kind only led to events of particular and spectacular grisliness, for all that the genetic and cultural variation between Dweller populations was much less than that displayed by any other galaxy wide grouping.The long, long arrived at consensus, particularly amongst those still nursing civilisational bruises from earlier encounters with what was arguably one of the galaxys most successful species, or those with the images of what had happened to others still fresh in their data banks, was that, on balance, it was best just to leave the Dwellers alone.Left to themselves the Dwellers disturbed nobody except occasionally themselves and those who thought too deeply about what they really represented.Their history, after all, like that of the galaxy as a whole, was one of almost but not quite uninterrupted peace and tranquillity: billions and billions of years of thankfully nothing much happening at all.In over ten billion years of civilisation there had been only three major Chaoses and the number of genuine galaxy spanning wars didnt even make it into double figures.In base eight!That was a record that the Dwellers seemed to feel everybody concerned ought to feel mildly proud of.Especially themselves.Welcome all!Chief Seer, good to see you!Seer Taak, Seer Yurnvic.Young friends.And this must be Colonel Hatherence.Pleased to make your acquaintance, maam.Duelbe, the bald, nearly spherical major domo of the Third Fury Shared Facility, greeted them in the transit hall as the military troop carrier disengaged and turned back towards the Pyralis.A couple of the youngest Seers, who had patently never encountered the positively ball like form of Duelbe before, stared.It was as a rule at such moments that comparisons regarding the similarity in shape of Third Fury and the major domo of its Shared Facility came to mind.Happily, on this occasion, if they were thought they went unvoiced.Servants took charge of luggage pallets.Hatherence shooed away retainers who offered to help her manoeuvre in the relatively confined space  the dome like hall, like the rest of the mostly underground facility, had been rebuilt on a human scale since the departure of the last species to be granted Seer status, with little spatial concession to other, effectively larger species.Colonel Hatherence was happy to float where she could without assistance, thank you, using trim vanes on the outside of her discus of esuit to propel her from place to place.Ah!Braam Ganscerel announced loudly, bouncing along the halls floor in long floating strides, idly fending himself off the ceiling above with casual prods of one staff like some strangely graceful, if inverted, pole vaulter.Thats better!One rarely appreciates gravity so much as when faced with so little of it, eh, Duelbe?The major domo smiled broadly, even though Fassin knew he must have heard the old man say this a dozen times or more.The retinue of junior Seers apparently hadnt, and gave every impression of being barely able to contain their hearty guffaws within their aching sides.The three double discs soared above a great curved canyon of cloud sliced deep within what looked like a convex bank of blood red snow a hundred kilometres high.Much further above, a sky of rushing yellow streamers afforded brief glimpses of a wanly cerise sky, dotted with the spike points of stars and, occasionally, a single, visibly sky crossing moon like a soft brown snowball.The formation of flying machines curved across towards the blood red bank of vapour and disappeared into it.Senses shifted.He felt himself reaching out with a slick effortlessness into mag and rad, grav grad and radio, pulling in a composite picture of his environment thousands of kilometres in diameter and hundreds deep, placing him with pin sharp clarity in a great reticulated accumulation of magnetic fields, radiation and gravitational gradient, all overlaid on the wide light image still available and the jelly like ghost vista of sound scape.Still taking the lead from Paggs, leading the trio, they dived towards a sharp thermocline coming into view a dozen klicks down.They flew out into a wide bubble of relative sight clarity, then into a squall of water snow.They dived deeper, through a band of pressure and temperature where water rain fell, pattering hard against the skins of their whirling double discs, then on down, down into even wide light darkness, down to the warm hydrogen slush where the discs floated like giant double cone yo yos, bobbing, steaming, flickering signals to each other.So, what do you think, young Taak?Good to be home?A fascinating experience, Fassin agreed.Were, what?He double checked his internal navigation instrumentation.Two equatorial sats along and a band up?Now, Fass, Paggs began.So if I do this  Fassin sent, and lunged his double disc towards Paggss.Paggs had guessed what was coming and already started to move away, flinching backwards and up.Fassins machine seemed to dart towards the other Seers remote craft, then draw back, stopping just short of where Paggss machine had been.Youve got just enough time to get out of the way, Fassin pointed out reasonably.Seer Taak Braam Ganscerel began.Whereas if I did something similar on the far side of the planet, Fassin continued,  at the far end of a whole chain of sats, the best part of a full light second away even without any processing delays, we might both now be listening to our remotes telling us that, at best, I just voided their warranties.Fassin, Ganscerel sent with a sigh.I think were all aware of the speed of light and the diameter of the planet.And these remotes are anyway not completely stupid, or unprotected.They have an extremely sophisticated collision avoidance system built into them.One we had to clear specifically with your friends in the Shrievalty to have built in, its so close to to being clever.But if a Dweller points a laser at you for fun, Fassin asked,  just to see if youll flinch, what good is any collision avoid ance system to you then?Perhaps, Ganscerel suggested mellowly,  one ought not to mix with the kind of Dweller who would be likely to act in such a manner in the first place.Except theyre the ones that are most likely to share interesting stuff with you, old man, not the desiccated, harmless but clueless pixie brains you tend to spend your time flattering, Fassin thought.He was fairly certain that it was just a thought.People always worried that in theory in VR you might say something you only meant to think, but he wasnt so rusty in the techniques of remote delving that he was truly concerned.It might, anyway, even do Braam Ganscerel some good to hear a few politely unspeakable things now and again.Perhaps, indeed, Chief Seer, was all he said.Hmm.Lets step out, shall we?They returned to the reality of a remote send suite buried deep in the Third Fury Facility, blinking in the light as technicians helped to unclip them from the couches, pushing themselves forward to clear the half domes of the NMR assemblages, handing back earpieces and simple black velvet blindfolds, flexing and stretching as though theyd been under for a genuinely long delve rather than a mere hour or so at a one to one time ratio.Paggs worked his fingers, undoing the last couple of soft tabs that connected him to the thin pneumo tubes which had both sensed his movements and would have prevented him from throwing himself right off the couch in the event that hed performed any especially energetic actions.Ganscerel lay with his eyes closed, breathing deeply and letting the technicians detach him from the machinery.Paggs glanced over.Are we convincing you at all, Fass?Youre convincing me its even easier to remote delve these days than it used to be.Fassin levered himself from the couch with the steady application of force from one small finger and let himself float very gently towards the floor.I would have taken your word for it.So, you only got one third of the volumes concerned, young Taak, Ganscerel said.Fassin was giving a very private briefing in an engineering store off the secondary ship hangar.Ganscerel had wanted it conducted in his quarters but there wasnt a way of squeezing the colonel in there.Present were Fassin, Ganscerel, Paggs and Colonel Hatherence.Fassin wanted them each to know as much as he did  or at least as much as he thought they ought to know  about what he had found on his long ago delve and what they would be looking for on the one they were hoping to begin the following day.Yes, he said.I traded some high definition images of Earth Twentieth Century European Expressionist paintings for  amongst a lot of other stuff  what was catalogued as a tri trans lated text of a pre Third Chaos Lutankleydar epic poem, a private, unpublished work by  or perhaps commissioned by  a Doge of the Enigmatics.It was all double encrypted and compressed but it was known to be in three volumes.I got three volumes from Valseir, only  as it turned out years later, when it was finally de mangled by the Jeltick  what Id been given wasnt Volumes One, Two and Three.It was Volume One, three times over, in three separate languages.And it wasnt by an Enigmatic Doge either.One of the volumes was in a previously known but untranslatable Penumbral language from the time of the Summation.When the translation was made it acted as a Rosetta; gave the key to a lot of other stuff, and that sidetracked everybody for a while.Then some pin eyed Jeltick scholar spotted a note at the end, buried in the appendices in a crude but related slang language, obviously added later, but not much later, that basically said the whole thing had been written during the Long Crossing of the Second Ship, by an Outcast Dweller skilled in the Penumbral language, and that, yes, of course there was a Dweller List, they  the ship, or its crew  had the key to it, and it would be included in Volume Two or Three of this epic poem.It was also, of course, in the ship, and the ship was heading for the Zateki system.Thats why the Jeltick sent an expedition straight there as soon as they had the translation.Why not come here, to Nasqueron, where they might have found the Third Volume?Paggs asked, smiling.Because the Shrievalty hadnt told them where the data had come from.Whether this was oversight or deliberate we havent been told.The Jeltick may have guessed it was from a Dweller Studies centre but they couldnt be sure whether it was or not and, if so, which one.They probably did start making inquiries, but they didnt want to alert anybody else to the importance of what they had.Dont forget, the information had been copied and re copied  it was lying about in data reservoirs all over the civilised galaxy.Quite possibly people had even already translated and read the main text but just hadnt got round to the appendices, where the all important note was.The slightest hint that there was anything of strategic interest in that tranche and everybody else would have dusted it off, read it and  bang  the Jeltick would have lost their edge.So they fuelled and tooled and set sail for Zateki instead.This could all be a hoax, you know, Ganscerel said, snorting.He adjusted his robes, frowning deeply.Ido believe I detect the laboured and tortuous signature of Dweller humour here.This could just be a joke at the expense of anyone foolish enough to fall for it.It could indeed, sir, Fassin agreed.But we have our orders and we have to make the effort, just in case it is all true.So we are looking for the remaining two volumes of this what is it called, exactly?Colonel Hatherence asked.Best translation, Fassin said, is, The Algebraist.Its all about mathematics, navigation as a metaphor, duty, love, longing, honour, long voyages home all that stuff.And what is or was this Long Crossing?Ganscerel asked irascibly.I havent heard of it.The voyage back home from what humans used to call the Triangulum Nebula, Fassin said, with a small smile.Well, Ganscerel said, frowning once more.We are not really much further forward, are we?And what, pray, do we call the Triangulum Nebula now, Seer Taak?We call it the Lost Souls II Galaxy, Chief Seer.The crossing was called the Long Crossing because it took thirty million years.The outward journey allegedly took almost no time, because it was conducted through an intergalactic wormhole, the portal location of which is amongst those included in the Dweller List.Hervil Apsile, Master Technician of the Third Fury Shared Facility, ran the ultrasonic hand held over the gascrafts starboard nacelle one more time, smiling with some satisfaction at the smooth line on the screen.Above his head, one of the Shared Facilitys drop ships stood on extended legs, a squat lifting body shape, hold doors open.To one side, the main hangars transparent dome showed a vast darkness, fitfully illuminated by long lighting flashes like sheets of tipped diamond catching the light of a dim blue sun.Checking for scrits, Hervil?Fassin asked, approaching by bounce along the fused rock floor.Apsile grinned at the sound of Fassins voice but watched the hand helds screen until hed got to the end of the seam he was inspecting.He switched the machine off and turned to Fassin.Just the standard varieties detected so far, Seer Taak.Scrits were the almost certainly mythical creatures which Dwellers blamed when anything went badly wrong anywhere in their vicinity.The humans who had lately taken up the baton of Dweller Studies had adopted early on the idea of scrits to account for the high degree of malfunctions any interaction with  or indeed near  the Dwellers seemed to involve.It was either that or accept that the Dwellers endemic technological carelessness and congenital lack of enthusiasm for keeping machinery in reliably working order was somehow contagious.Fassin patted the dark flank of the fat, arrowhead shaped gascraft.This was his own machine, designed specifically for and partly by Fassin himself.It was about five metres long, four across the beam if you included the outboard manoeuvring nacelles and a little under two metres in height.Its smooth form was broken only by the shut lines of its various manipulators and manoeuvring impellers, a few sensor bulges, and the rear power assembly, vanes currently stowed.Fassin rubbed his hand over its port tail fin.All prepped and ready, Herv?Entirely, Apsile said.He was Nubianly black, slim but muscled, sleekly bald.Only a few lines round his eyes made him look remotely as old as he was, which was very.Every year or so, before his annual depilatory treatment  he thought gene treatment too invasive  a white micro stubble would start to appear on his scalp, giving his head the appearance of a bristling star field.And you?he asked.Oh, prepped and ready too, Fassin told him.Hed just come from the days final briefing, with the Dweller Current State people.It was their challenging brief to try and keep abreast of what was going on in the sheer and utter chaos that was Dweller society and, as a sideline, keep track of where the major Dweller structures, institutions and  especially  Individuals Of Interest were at any given moment.The news was not good: a formal war was brewing between Zone two and Belt C, at least one long term storm structure between Zone one and Belt D was collapsing while two were building elsewhere, and the movements of IOIs recently had been particularly fluid.One might even say capricious.As for the whereabouts of choal Valseir, well.Nobody had seen anything of the fellow for centuries.Dwellers had always been hard to follow.In the past people had tried setting drone remotes on individuals to keep tabs on them.However, Dwellers regarded this as a gross intrusion on their privacy and had an uncanny ability to spot and destroy any such platforms, micro gascraft or bugs, no matter how small or clever they were.Dwellers also sulked.When people had the temerity to try anything so underhand, cooperation was withdrawn.Sometimes over an entire population.Sometimes for years.The Slow Seers of Nasqueron had a pretty good relationship with the local Dwellers.By Dweller Studies standards it was almost close, but only because the Seers tried to interfere as little as possible with Dweller life.In return the Dwellers were relatively cooperative, and broadcast a daily update on the location of their most important cities, structures and institutions.This eight and a bit hourly bulletin was a byword for trustworthiness  almost a legend  in Dweller Studies, on occasion approaching accuracy rates of very nearly ninety per cent.Things fine with Sept Bantrabal?Apsile asked.All well.Slovius sends his regards.Fassin had talked to his uncle a few hours earlier, still trying to persuade him to leave the Autumn House.The time delay between Third Fury and glantine made a normal conversation just about possible.Hed caught up with Jaal too, on the other side of glantine, at her Septs Spring House.Life appeared relatively normal back on glantine, the new Emergency affecting people there less than it seemed to on Sepekte.Apsile flicked a roll screen from his sleeve and tapped a few patches.He looked casually up at the lifter ship poised above the little gascraft, ready to accept the smaller vessel inside its open hold and take it down to the gas giants atmosphere.Fassin followed the Master Technicians gaze.He looked at a dark shape already hanging inside the cargo space, protruding downwards from it like a thick wheel.He frowned.That looks a lot like Colonel Hatherence, he said.Not many places shell fit, muttered Apsile.Eh?A voice bellowed.Then, quieter: My name?Oh.Yes, thats me.Seer Taak.Major Taak, I should say.Hello.Sorry; asleep.Well, you know, one does.Thought Id try out this space here for size.Fits very well, must say.I shall be able to be transported to the atmosphere of Nasqueron most ably by this vessel, if needs be.Well, so I think.Think you so too, Master Technician?Apsile smiled broadly, revealing teeth as jet as his skin.I think so too, maam.There we are agreed, then.The giant hanging discus dropped fractionally from its mountings inside the delta shaped transporter, so that it could turn and twist towards them.And so.Major Taak.How goes your attempt to persuade Chief Seer Braam Ganscerel that you ought to be allowed to delve directly?Fassin smiled.It goes like a long term delve, colonel; exceeding slow.A pity!Apsile thumbed a patch on his roll screen, clicked the screen back into his sleeve and nodded at the little gascraft.Well, shes ready.Want to put her up?he asked.Why not?It had become something of a tradition that Apsile and Fassin lifted the craft into the carrier.They stooped, took an end each and  very slowly at first  hoisted the arrowhead into the space above, letting their feet lift off the floor at the end to slow it down.The gascraft weighed next to nothing in Third Furys minuscule gravity, but it massed over two tonnes and the laws regarding inertia and momentum still applied.They were carried three metres up inside the drop ships hold, towards the opened arms of the waiting gascraft cradle.The Colonels esuit took up the space of two of the little gascraft, but that still left room for another five in the drop ships hold.The arrowhead snicked into place alongside the tall discus that held Colonel Hatherence.Satisfied that the arrowhead was correctly fastened in, the two men let themselves fall back to the floor.The colonel drifted down alongside them.Fassin looked up at the sleek lines of the gascraft.How small it looks, he thought.Tiny space to spend years in decades in even centuries They landed.Apsile, more experienced, got his knee flex just right; Fassin bounced.The giant esuit had to tilt to clear the carrier ships opened hold doors, toppling then coming upright again with a burr of vanes and a whoosh of air.Imust say I myself would prefer to enter the atmosphere directly, that is to say, in fact.Indeed, in reality, the colonel shouted.Yes, Fassin said.I would too, colonel.Good luck in that!the oerileithe boomed.Thank you, Fassin said.I suspect good luck will be necessary, if not sufficient.A few hours later he had just about enough time to reflect that it was bad luck which produced the opportunity they had both been looking for, before he had to flee for his life.* * *  The others persuaded him eventually.Thay, Sonj and Mome were all going.Why not him?Not nervous, surely?Maybe just too lazy?He wasnt nervous or  quite  that lazy.He just wanted to stay back at the nest and bland with K, who was coming to the end of a tream, socked into a traumalyser and a linked up subsal.She floated, lightly tethered, in the gentle stream blowing out of the air chair, slim graceful body semi foetal, arms waving, her long, end tied chestnut hair blossoming above her like a cobra hood, wrapping over her head then wafting back again.The NMR net was like a hand with twenty plus slim silver fingers grasping her head from the back.The subsals transparent tube disappeared into a tiny neuro taplet just behind her left earlobe.Ks eyes moved languidly behind their lids and her face seemed set in a smile.At this stage, coming out of a long tream, it was as though she had been diving in some abyssal depths and was now swimming slowly back in through a few kilometres of sunlit shallows.You could wade out to meet the person coming in without surrendering yourself to the whole para lucid chemical NMR holo induced dream state, you could sort of snorkel with them while they still gilled, heading for the beach that was mundane reality.Hey, Fass!shed sent when he first dipped in to join her, slipping on a small NMR collar and becoming part of the slowly evaporating tream.Shed been away for a day and a half; a long one.You came to meet me?Thanks, part!Have fun?he asked.More than fun.Guess where Ive been?He sent a shrug.Faintest.I did a delve!I treamed a delve like Seers do, into Nasqueron!Well, it wasnt really Nasq, it was another gas giant called Furenasyle.Thats where the chip must have been templated.You heard of Furenasyle?Yeah, its another place they do Dweller Studies.So you treamed you were there?Delving, yeah?Surely did.You make it sound so amazing.And, Fass, it was great!Best tream well, second best tream Ive ever had!K sent a kind of complicit, sexy smirk in his direction.He guessed the tream she was referring to.Theyd experienced it together.A love tream, a joint immersion in what they felt for each other.Well, supposedly.Love treams were tacky in some ways  you could still lie about your feelings in them, and if you selected the right template from the traumalyser device and suitable accompanying chemicals from the subsal, you could pretty much guarantee a tream of surpassing, wide eyed heart throbbing bliss even between two people who basically hated each other.But it had been good, between the two of them.Good, but not something that hed wanted to do again.He supposed he was suspicious of the whole Virtual Reality experience, and treaming, especially with a synched in subsal providing appropriate synthesised chemicals for delivery to the brain, was the most immersive VR you could find.Legally or semi legally, anyway.You should try it!Really!It would be like practice, dont you think?I suppose.If delving is what Im going to end up doing.I take it youd recommend it.If its like that, sure!Sure was what he was not.He was still young, still undecided.Should he become a Slow Seer, like everybody seemed to expect him to become, even including the people he shared the nest with on Hab 4409 (The Happy Hab!)?Or should he do something else entirely?He still didnt know.The very fact that everybody thought he would become a Seer eventually, after a few wild years  and these were surely wild years, not something that you ever imagined could go on for ever or even for very long  made him all the more determined not to do what was expected of him well, maybe determined was too strong a word, he admitted.Reluctant.Made him more reluctant.He supposed that was better.Still, he might surprise them all.He might go off and do something entirely, utterly and excitingly different.He just had to experience Jots of different things until he found the right thing, was all.Listen, Im probably going with the others to the protest.Well, unless you need me, you know   Good for you!I dont mind.You go.Id come too, but I need to ramp out of this shallow.That last time I steeped really crawled.Ugh!Okay.See you.Later, part!He left the nest.The nest  a low gee pod of forty or so mostly small spherical rooms housing a kind of commune of (all human) gappers, nopers, treamers, trustafarians, zealers and zonkers  was in a big bunch of living spaces up near the habs long axis, near the (rather arbitrarily termed) west end, not far beneath the suntube.The nest allegedly belonged to the mother of one of the trustafarians, though unofficially it was the Immaturian Peoples Republic of Whateverness (and had semi official paperwork and software to prove it, too).Hab 4409 was one of a few hundred thousand habitats orbiting Sepekte.It was average size, a cylinder of re formed asteroid material fifty kilometres long and ten across, spinning to create about two thirds of a gee at its internal diameter surface.It turned in the unending sunlight like a giant garden roller flattening photons.Two twelve kilometre mirror lens systems  one at either end  faced Ulubis star like a pair of vast, unbearably thin flowers.Further mirror complexes funnelled the captured sunlight through two windows of diamond sheet into the habs long axis, where a final set of mirrors  moving up and down the suntube to create something like the feel of a planetary day  finally directed the light towards the internal surface.Or at least finally directed the light towards the internal surface if there wasnt something like one of the grape bunch like nest complexes in the way (more mirrors).Many more people lived in the habs than lived on planets in the system and most of the habs were somewhere near Sepekte.Hab 4409 had been a fairly liberal, free flowing, laissez faire, who cares kind of place almost since its inception  as part of a horrendously intricate incumbent species asset swap write off dodge  two millennia earlier.Even its ultimate ownership had never fully been settled, and several generations of lawyers had gone to their plush retirements  having followed the saga of Hab 4409s provenance and title since their days as articled clerks  still lacking a sense of closure re the above.So the place attracted drifters, artists, misfits, natural exiles, political and other eccentrics and slightly deranged or badly messed up people of more or less every sort, and always had.Most were from Ulubis but some were more exotic and from further afield, generally trustafarians and or gappers portaling in from the rest of the Mercatoria, taking time out between education and responsibility to relax a little.The place produced good art, it was an unofficial  but tax deductible  finishing school for the aforesaid children of the rich (give the darling brats true freedom and let them see how empty it was, was the idea), it was a way station for those heading out to disgrace or back from perdition, and it was a halfway house for those who might or might not ever again contribute anything useful to society but who just might galvanise it fundamentally.(And, if you wanted to be really paranoid about stuff, it was  as far as the authorities were concerned  a relatively easy to watch and even easier to close down sump for dangerous ideas: a radical trap. )It was useful, in other words.It fulfilled a purpose, if not several.In a society as large as that which existed around Ulubis, somewhere had to provide that sort of service.People were people.Some would always be straight, some would always be a bit twisted, but they all had some sort of part to play, and they were all in some sense valuable, were they not?But now the fucking Mercatoria, the fucking Ascendancy or fucking Omnocracy, or whatever they fucking were, the fucking Hierchon (more likely, one of his new rotational crop of advisers who saw a way to make some money and gain some extra power), or the Peregal below him or Apparitor below him or just the Diegesian gimplet who was actually nominally the governor or mayor or whatever he was supposed to fucking be (his post, his presence and his protecting bully boys only here at all thanks to an earlier dispute over who controlled what, resulting in a grubby, century old compromise), anyway the fucking big boys, the fucking people who owned fucking everything or thought some fucker ought to own fucking everything had decided, decreed, deemed that proprietorship of the whole fucking place  and that of lots of other similar habs in similar situations of disputed\uncertain\dubious\happily contingent ownership  should pass to what they called a properly accredited and responsible authority.Which basically meant them.Or if not them, their chums.Somebody who took things like ownership and rent gathering and petty law enforcement and so on seriously.It was the law makers, the law givers, being outlaws, and it would not be allowed to stand, it would not be allowed to pass, it would not go unchallenged, it would not go into the local statutes without a serious fucking challenge.These people, for whatever fuckwit reason, were destroying part of what was good about the habs, about Sepekte Orbit, about Ulubis system, about the society they were all in the end a part of.Ultimately they were being stupid and self destructive, and all that was required was that the people who could see all this clearly  because they were right here, at the sharp end, at the cutting edge  pointed this out to them.They were all on the same side in the end, it was just that sometimes the fuckers in authority got too far away from the reality of life as the mass of people lived it, and that was when you had to make a stand, make a point and make yourself heard.So they went to the protest, down the friction tubes and the bungees and along the tramways to the central plaza and the makings of a great crowd.You just have to think about it, Mome said as they walked the last street into the plaza.The Beyonders never attack habs, never attack whole cities, never attack anything big and easy and defenceless.They attack the military and the authorities and big infrastructure stuff.Their attacks, their violence, their military strategy is a discourse amenable to analysis if one is prepared to approach it shorn of propagandistic preconceptions.And the message is clear: their argument, their war is with the Mercatorial system, with the Ascendancy and the Omnocracy and the Administrata and not with the common people, not with us.Resent being called common!Sonj protested.Erring on the side of generosity including you in the category people, Sonj, Mome shot back.Mome was a little guy, pale, intense and always slightly hunched, as though perpetually preparing either to pounce or duck.Sonj was huge; a big bumbling dark brown geezer of changeable moods and intensely curly short red hair who only looked at home or even slightly graceful in low gee.Doesnt necessarily make them the good guys, Fassin insisted.Makes them people open to reason, people capable of indulging in meaningful dialogue, Mome said.Not just mad fuckers to be put down like vermin, which is pretty much what were told they are.So whats stopping them talking to us?Fassin asked.Us, Mome said.Takes two to talk.They all looked at him.Mome was known to talk a lot.Sometimes to audiences who had, basically, long since fallen asleep.He shrugged.My cousin Lain Thay said.Another one?Mome asked, feigning incredulity.Sister of cousin Kel, half sister of cousin Yayz, Thay explained patiently.She was Sonjs part, also generously made; awkward in low gee but bouncily agile on the habs internal surface at two thirds of a gee.My cousin Lain, she continued determinedly, the one in the Navarchy, says that she reckons the reason the Beyonders attack so much at all is because if they dont the Navarchy and the Summed Fleet goes after them.And we dont just attack military stuff.She says we hit their habs.Kill millions of them.Lot of offs unhappy with  Lots of whats unhappy with?Mome asked.Lots of offs, Thay repeated.I got the word, Mome repeated with a sigh, I just didnt get the meaning.He snapped his fingers.Wait.Short for officers, right?Correct.Brilliant.Carry on.Lot of offs unhappy with this, Thay said again, so the yonds  the Beyonders  just attack us to keep us on the defensive.She nodded once.Thats what my cousin Lain says.Ayee!Crazy yonding talk, Mome said, putting his hands over his ears.Get us all arrested.They laughed.At least we have the freedom to say this sort of thing, Fassin pointed out.Mome did his special Hollow Laugh.In the central plaza, Fassin greeted people, drank in the sense of solidarity and slightly edgy fun  lots of inventive costumes, towering floss sculptures and buzzing balloonderers (trailing slogan banners, yelling chants and scattering narconfetti)  but still felt oddly apart from it all.He looked up and around, ignoring for the moment the people  mostly human  and the circle of domed and gleaming buildings.The hab was a giant, verdant city rolled up into a spinning tube, with small hills and many lakes and criss cross avenues between low rise hanging garden apartments and winding rivers and spindly towers, some arched like bows and reaching all the way up to the suntube, where they curved  or needle eyed  round to meet towers on the far side.Bunches of nests  surrounded by mirrors, trailed with friction tubes like jungle creepers  clustered near the long axis, and dirigiblisters floated like strange, semi transparent clouds beneath them.Then Fassin heard some sort of shout at one edge of the crowd, nearest the palace of the Diegesian, which was the focus for the protest.He might have smelled something strange, but then that was probably just one of the cruising balloonderers disseminating some drug that Fassins immedio immune system hadnt recognised.Then he realised maybe it wasnt, because all the balloonderers dropped suddenly, as one, out of the air.Also, the sun in the suntube went out.Which never happened.He heard lots of odd noises, some of which might have been screaming.It seemed to get cold very quickly.That was odd too.People were hitting him, with their shoulders mostly, as they went running past him, then they were falling over him, and he realised he was Fassin?, realised he was Fassin lying down, then he was Fassin getting hit again, but he was Fassin trying to get up and stand again, and he was Fassin, he was Fassin, he was on his knees and he was Fassin just about to get up from his knees onto his feet  swaying, feeling very strange, wondering what all the people were doing lying down around him  when  Fassin  he was knocked down again.By a man in armour, steel grey, with a big trunchbuster club and no face and a couple of little buzz drones at each shoulder, spraying gas and making a high, terrible keening noise that he  Fassin!wanted to get away from, but his nose and eyes and everything else stung and hurt and he didnt know what to do, he was Fasssin!just standing there and the guy with the big club thing as long as a spear came up to him and he Fasssin?stupidly thought he might ask him what was going on and what was wrong with Faaassssiiinnn?wrong when the man swept his club spear trunchbuster thing round and into his face, knocking some teeth out and sending him spinning to Fassin?His name finally jolted him awake.Back with us?Good.The speaker was a small man in a large chair across a cramped looking metal desk.The room  or whatever  was too dark to see into, even with IR.The sound of the mans voice in the space suggested it was not a big space.Fassin was aware that his face and especially his mouth hurt.He tried to wipe his mouth.He looked down.His hands could not move because his forearms were  he tried to think of the right word  shackled?They were shackled to the seat he was sitting in.What the hell was this?He started laughing.Somebody hit him in his bones.It was like his entire skeleton was a wind chime and his flesh and muscles and organs were somewhere else, only nearby but still connected somehow and some fucker  actually, some very large group of fuckers  had taken a whole load of hammers and whacked each one of his bones really hard at the same time.The pain went almost as quickly as it arrived, leaving just a weird sort of echo in his nerves.What the fuck was zhat?he asked the little man.His voice sounded comical with some of his teeth knocked out.His tongue probed the gaps.Felt like two out, one loose.He tried to remember how long it took adult teeth to grow back.The little man was quite a jolly looking soul, with a plump, amused seeming face and chubby, rosy cheeks.His hair was black, cropped.He wore a uniform of a type that Fassin didnt recognise.Are you shucking torturing me?Fassin asked.No, the little man said in a very reasonable tone of voice.Im just doing this to get your attention.One of his hands moved on the desks surface.Fassins bones clattered as though played upon again.His nerves, having experienced this twice now, decided that really this was no joke, and in fact felt extremely sore.All right!All right!he heard himself saying.Itake the shucking point.Fucking point, he said, working out how to adapt his pronunciation to his new dental layout.Dont swear, the little man said, and hurt him again.Okay!he screamed.His head hung.Snot dripped from his nose, saliva and blood from his mouth.Please dont swear, the little man said.It indicates an untidy mind.Just tell me what the f  what you want, Fassin said.Was this real?Had he been in some sort of weird VR dream ever since hed joined K for the coming out of the shallows end of tream thing earlier?Was this what happened when you got tream templates cheap, or illegally copied or something?Was this real?It felt painful enough to be real.He looked down at his legs and the hems of his shorts, all covered in blood and mucus and snot.He could see individual hairs on his legs, some standing, some plastered to his skin.He could see pores.Didnt that mean it was real?But of course it didnt.Treams, simcasts, VR, all depended on the fact that the mind could really only concentrate on one thing at a time.The rest was illusion.Human sight, the most complicated sense the species possessed, had been doing that for millions of years, fooling the mind behind the eyes.You thought you had colour vision, and in some detail, over this wide angle but really you didnt; accurate colour vision was concentrated within a tiny part of the visual field, with only vague, movement wary black and white awareness extending over the rest.The brain played tricks on itself to pretend that it saw as well away from the centre of its visual target as it did right at that bulls eye.Smart VR used that same deception; zoom in on a detail and it would be created for you in all its pinpoint exactitude, but everything else you werent attending to with such concentration could safely be ignored until your attention swung that way, keeping the amount of processing power within acceptable limits.Fassin dragged his attention away from his blood spattered leg.Is this real?he asked.The little man sighed.Mr Taak, he said, glancing down at a screen, your profile indicates that you are from a respectable family and may one day even become a useful member of society.You shouldnt be mixing and living with the sort of people you have been mixing and living with.Youve all been very foolish and people have suffered because of that stupidity.Youve been living in a kind of dream, really, and that dream is now over.Officially.I think you ought to go back home.Dont you?Where are my friends?Mr Iifilde, Mr Resiptiss, Ms Cargin and Ms Hohuel?Fassin just stared at him.Shit, in all the last few months hed been staying here hed only known them by their first names.He supposed those were Thay, Sonj and Momes last names, but really hed no idea.And there had been four, hadnt there?Did that mean they were counting K as well?But she hadnt been to the protest.Theyre being held elsewhere, or theyve been processed and released, or were still looking for them.The little man smiled.Fassin looked down at his arms, held within metal hoops.He tried to move his legs, then leaned over and looked down.His legs were shackled too.Or manacled or whatever.His mouth felt very odd.He ran his tongue round where his teeth had been, checking again.He supposed hed have to get false ones until the new ones grew back.
