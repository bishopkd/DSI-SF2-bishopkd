He hit the deck just before the sagging Culture agent did.Yalson was still staggering back after being thumped against the far bulkhead.Horza lay on the deck watching Balveda's feet and legs for a second, then he quickly scrambled up, saw Balveda move groggily, her red haired head scraping on the deck surface, her dark eyes opening briefly.He pulled the stun gun trigger again, keeping it depressed and pointing the gun at the woman's head.She shook spastically for a second, saliva drooling from one corner of her mouth, then went limp.The red bandanna rolled off her head."Are you crazy?"Yalson screamed.Horza turned to her."Her name isn't Gravant; it's Perosteck Balveda, and she's an agent in the Culture's Special Circumstances section.That's their euphemism for Military Intelligence, in case you didn't know," he said.Yalson was backed up almost to the mess room entrance, her eyes full of fear, her hands clutching at the surface of the bulkhead on either side of her.Horza went up to her.She shrank from him, and he sensed her getting ready to strike out.He stopped short of her, turned the stun gun round and handed it to her, grip first."If you don't believe me we'll probably all end up dead," he said, edging the gun forward towards her hands.She took it eventually."I'm serious," he told her."Search her for weapons.Then get her into the mess and strap her into a seat.Tie her hands down, tight.And her legs.Then strap in yourself.We've leaving; I'll explain later. "He started to go past her, then he turned and looked into her eyes."Oh, and keep stunning her every now and again, on maximum power.Special Circumstancers are very tough. "He turned and went towards the mess room.He heard the stun gun click."Kraiklyn," Yalson said.He stopped and turned round again.She was pointing the gun straight at him, holding it in both hands and level with his eyes.Horza sighed and shook his head."Don't," he said."What about Horza?""He's safe.I swear it.But he'll be dead if we don't get out of here now.And if she wakes up. "He nodded past Yalson at the long, inert form of Balveda.He turned again, then walked into the mess, the back of his head and the nape of his neck tingling with anticipation.Nothing happened.Dorolow looked up from the table and said, "What was that noise?"as Horza went past."What noise?"Horza said as he went through to the bridge.Yalson watched Kraiklyn's back as he walked through the mess room.He said something to Dorolow, then he was through to the bridge.She let the stun gun down slowly; it hung in one hand.She looked at the gun thoughtfully and said to herself, quietly, "Yalson, my girl, there are times when I think you're a little too loyal. "She raised the gun again as the cabin door opened just a crack and a small voice said, "Is it safe out there yet?"Yalson grimaced, pushed the door open and looked at the drone, which was retreating further into the cabin.She nodded her head to the side and said, "Get out here and give me a hand with this bod, you liverless piece of clockwork. ""Wake up!"Horza kicked Wubslin's leg as he swung back into his chair.Aviger was sitting in the third seat in the flight deck, looking anxiously at the screens and controls.Wubslin jumped, then looked round with bleary eyes."Eh?"he said, then: "I was just resting my eyes. "Horza pulled out the CAT's manual controls from their recess in the edge of the console.Aviger looked at them with apprehension."Just how hard did you knock your head?"he said to Horza.Horza smiled coldly at him.He scanned the screens as fast as he could and threw the safety switches on the ship's fusion motors.He tried traffic control once more.The Smallbay was still dark.The outside pressure gauge registered zero.Wubslin was talking to himself as he checked over the craft's monitoring systems."Aviger," Horza said, not looking at the older man, "I think you'd better strap in. ""What for?"Aviger asked quietly, measuredly."We can't go anywhere..We can't move.We're stuck here until a tug arrives to take us out, aren't we?""Of course we are," Horza said, adjusting the readying controls of the fusion motors and putting the ship leg controls on automatic.He turned and looked at Aviger."Tell you what; why don't you go and get that new recruit's kitbag?Take it down to the hangar and shove it into a vactube. ""What?"Aviger said, his already creased face becoming more lined as he frowned."I thought she was leaving. ""She was, but whoever is trying to keep us in here started evacuating the air from the Smallbay before she could get off.Now I want you to take her kitbag and all the other gear she may have left lying around and stow it in a vactube, all right?"Aviger got up from the seat slowly, looking at Horza with a tense, worried expression on his face."All right. "He started to leave the bridge, then hesitated, looking back at Horza."Kraiklyn, why am I putting her kitbag in the vactube?""Because there's almost certainly a very powerful bomb in it; that's why.Now get down there and do it.Aviger nodded and left, looking even less happy.Horza turned back to the controls.They were almost ready.Wubslin was still talking to himself and hadn't strapped in properly, but he seemed to be doing his part competently enough, despite frequent belches and pauses to scratch his chest and head.Horza knew he was putting the next bit off, but it had to be done.He pressed the ident button."This is Kraiklyn," he said, and coughed."Identification complete," the console said immediately.Horza wanted to shout, or at least to sag in his seat with relief, but he hadn't the time to do either, and Wubslin would have thought it a little strange.So might the ship's computer, for that matter: some machines were programmed to watch for signs of joy or relief after the formal identification was over.So he did nothing to celebrate, just brought the fusion motor primers up to operating temperature."Captain!"The small drone dashed back into the bridge, coming to a halt between Wubslin and Horza."You will let me off this ship at once and report the irregularities taking place aboard immediately, or "  "Or what?"Horza said, watching the temperature in the CAT's fusion motors soar."If you think you can get off this ship you're welcome to try; probably Culture agents would blow you to dust even if you did get out. ""Culture agents?"the small machine said with a sneer in its voice."Captain, for your information this GSV is a demilitarised civilian vessel under the control of the Vavatch Hub authorities and within the terms laid down in the Idiran Culture War Conduct Treaty drawn up shortly after the commencement of hostilities.How "  "So who turned the lights off and let the air out, idiot?"Horza said, turning to the machine briefly.He looked back to the console, turning the bow radar up as high as it would go and taking readings through the blank wall of the rear of the Smallbay."I don't know," the drone said, "but I rather doubt it would be Culture agents.Who or what do you think these supposed agents are after?You?""What if they were?"Horza took another look at the holo display of the GSV's internal layout.He briefly magnified the volume around Smallbay 27492 before switching the repeater screen off.The drone was silent for a second, then backed off through the doorway."Great.I'm locked in an antique with a paranoid lunatic.I think I'll go and look for somewhere safer than this. ""You do that!"Horza yelled down the corridor after it.He turned the hangar circuit back on."Aviger?"he said."I've done it," said the old man's voice."Right.Get to the mess fast and strap in. "Horza killed the circuit again."Well," Wubslin said, sitting back in his seat and scratching his head, looking at the bank of screens in front of him with their arrays of figures and graphs, "I don't know what it is you're intending to do, Kraiklyn, but whatever it is, we're as ready as we'll ever be to do it. "The stout engineer looked across at Horza, lifted himself slightly from his seat and pulled the restraining straps over his body.Horza grinned at him, trying to look confident.His own seat's restrainers were a little more sophisticated, and he just had to throw a switch for cushioned arms to swing over and inertia fields to come on.He pulled his helmet over his head from the hinged position and heard it hiss shut."Oh my God," Wubslin said, looking slowly away from Horza to stare at the almost featureless rear wall of the Smallbay shown on the main screen."I sure as hell hope you're not going to do what I think you are.Horza didn't reply.He hit the button to talk to the mess."All right?""Just about, Kraiklyn, but " Yalson said.Horza killed that circuit, too.He licked his lips, took the controls in his gloved hands, sucked in a deep breath, then flicked the thumb buttons on the CAT's three fusion motors.Just before the noise started he heard Wubslin say:  "Oh, my God, you are "  The screen flashed, went dark, then flashed again.The view of the Smallbay's rear wall was lit by three jets of plasma bursting from underneath the ship.A noise like thunder filled the bridge and reverberated through the whole craft.The two outboard motors were the main thrust, vectored down for the moment; they blasted fire onto the deck of the Smallbay, scattering the machinery and equipment from underneath and around the craft, slamming it into walls and off the roof as the blinding jets of flame steadied under the vessel.The inboard, lift only nose motor fired raggedly at first, then settled quickly, starting to burn its own hole through the thin layer of ultradense material which covered the Smallbay floor.The Clear Air Turbulence stirred like a waking animal, groaning and creaking and shifting its weight.On the screen, a huge shadow veered across the wall and the roof in front as the infernal light from the nose fusion motor burned under the ship; rolling clouds of gas from burning machinery were starting to haze over the view.Horza was amazed that the walls of the Smallbay had held out.He flicked the bow laser at the same time as increasing the fusion motor power.The screen detonated with light.The wall ahead burst open like a flower seen in time lapse, huge petals throwing themselves towards the ship and a million pieces of wreckage and debris flashing past the vessel's nose on the shock wave of air bursting in from the far side of the lasered wall.At the same time, the Clear Air Turbulence lifted off.The leg weight readouts stopped at zero, then blanked out as the legs, glowing red with heat, stowed themselves inside the hull.Emergency undercarriage cooling circuits whined into action.The craft started to slew to one side, shaking with its own power and with the impact of debris swirling about it.The view ahead cleared.Horza steadied the ship, then gunned the rear motors, flinging some of their power backwards, towards the Smallbay doors.A rear screen showed them glowing white hot.Horza would dearly have liked to head that way, but reversing and ramming the doors with the CAT would have probably been suicidal, and turning the craft in such a confined space impossible.Just going forward was going to be hard enough  The hole wasn't big enough.Horza saw it coming towards him and knew straight away.He used one shaking finger on the laser beam spread control set in the semi wheel of the controls, turning the spread up to maximum then firing once more.The screen washed out with light again, all around the perimeter of the hole.The CAT stuck its nose and then its body into another Smallbay.Horza waited for something to hit the sides or roof of the white hot gap, but nothing happened; they sailed through on their three pillars of fire, throwing light and wreckage and waves of smoke and gas before them.The dark waves blasted out over shuttles; the whole Smallbay they were now moving slowly through was full of shuttles of every shape and description.They were floating over them, battering them and melting them with their fire.Horza was aware of Wubslin sitting on the seat beside him, his eyes locked onto the view ahead, his legs drawn up as far as possible so that his knees stuck up above the edge of the console, and his arms locked in a sort of square over his head, each hand grasping the bicep of the other arm.His face was a mask of fear and incredulity when Horza turned round to glance at him, and grinned.Wubslin pointed frenziedly at the main screen."Watch!"he shrieked over the racket.The CAT was shaking and bouncing, rocked by the stream of superheated matter pouring from under its hull.It would be using the atmosphere around it to produce plasma, now that there was air available, and in the relatively confined space of the Smallbays the turbulence created was enough to shake the vessel bodily.There was another wall ahead, coming up faster than Horza would have liked.They were slewing slightly again as well; he narrowed the laser angle again and fired, pulling the ship round at the same time.The wall flashed once around its edges; the roof and floor of the Smallbay flashed in loops of flame where the laser caught them, and dozens of parked shuttles ahead of them pulsed with light and heat.The wall ahead started to fall slowly back, but the CAT was coming up on it faster than it was crumpling.Horza gasped and tried to pull back; he heard Wubslin howl, as the vessel's nose hit the undamaged centre of the wall.The view on the main screen tilted as the ship rammed into the wall material.Then the nose came down, the Clear Air Turbulence quivered like an animal shaking water from its fur, and they were rocking and yawing into yet another Smallbay.It was totally empty.Horza gunned the engines a little more, took a couple of bursts with the laser at the next wall, then watched in amazement as this wall, instead of falling back like the last one, crashed down towards them like a vast castle drawbridge, slamming in one fiery piece onto the deck of the empty Smallbay.In a fury of steam and gas, a mountain of water appeared over the top of the collapsing wall and poured out in a huge wave towards the approaching ship.Horza heard himself shouting.He rammed the motor controls full on and kept the laser fire button hard down.The CAT leapt forward.It flashed over the surface of the cascading water, enough of the plasma heat smashing into its liquid surface to instantly fill all the space of Smallbays its passage had created with a boiling fog of steam.As the tide of water continued to pour from the flooded Smallbay and the CAT screeched above it, the air about the ship filled with superheated steam.The external pressure gauge went up too quickly for the eye to follow; the laser blasted even more vapour off the water in front, and with an explosion like the end of the world the next wall blew out ahead of the vessel  weakened by the laser and finally blasted away by the sheer pressure of steam.The Clear Air Turbulence shot out from the tunnel of linked Smallbays like a bullet from a gun.Motors flaming, in the middle of a cloud of gas and steam which it quickly outdistanced, it roared into a canyon of air filled space between towering walls of bay doors and opened accommodation sections, lighting up kilometres of wall and cloud, screaming with its three flame filled throats, and seemingly pulling after it a tidal wave of water and a volcano like cloud of steam, gas and smoke.The water fell, turning from a solid wave into something like heavy surf, then spray, then just rain and water vapour, following the huge flapping card of the bay door tumbling through the air.The CAT wrenched itself round, twisting and slewing through the air in an attempt to check its headlong rush towards the far wall of Smallbay doors facing it across that vast internal canyon.Then its motors flickered and went out.The Clear Air Turbulence started to fall.Horza gunned the controls, but the fusion motors were dead.The screen showed the wall of doors to other bays on one side, then air and clouds, then the wall of bay doors on the other side.They were in a spin.Horza looked over at Wubslin as he fought with the controls.The engineer was staring at the main screen with a glazed expression on his face."Wubslin!"Horza screamed.The fusion motors stayed dead   "Aaah!"Wubslin seemed to have woken up to the fact that they were falling out of control; he leapt at the controls in front of him."Just fly it!"he shouted."I'll try the primers!Must have over pressured the motors!"Horza wrestled with the controls while Wubslin tried to restart the engines.On the screen, walls spun crazily about them and clouds beneath them were coming up fast  beneath them; really beneath them; a dead flat layer of clouds.Horza shook the controls again.The nose motor burst into life, guttering wildly, sending the spinning craft careering off towards one side of the artificial cliff of bay doors and walls.Horza cut the motor out.He steered into the spin, using the craft's control surfaces rather than the motors, then he aimed the whole ship straight down and put his fingers on the laser buttons again.The clouds flashed up to meet the vessel.He closed his eyes and squeezed the laser controls.The Ends of Invention was so huge it was built on three almost totally separate levels, each over three kilometres deep.They were pressure levels, there because otherwise the differential between the very bottom and the very top of the giant ship would have been the difference between standard sea level and a mountain top somewhere in the tropopause.As it was, there existed a three and a half thousand metre difference between the base and roof of each pressure level, making sudden journeys by traveltube from one to the other inadvisable.In the immense open cave that was the hollow centre of the GSV the pressure levels were marked by force fields, not anything material, so that craft could pass from one level to another without having to go outside the vessel, and it was towards one of those boundaries, marked by cloud, that the Clear Air Turbulence was falling.Firing the laser did no good whatsoever, though Horza didn't know that at the time.It was a Vavatch computer, which had taken over the internal monitoring and control from the Culture's own Minds, which opened a hole in the force field to let the falling vessel through.It did so in the mistaken assumption that less damage would be caused to The Ends of Invention by letting the rogue vessel fall through than having it impact.In the centre of a sudden maelstrom of air and cloud, in its own small hurricane, the CAT burst through from the thick air at the bottom of one pressure level and into the thin atmosphere at the top of the one below.A vortex of rag clouded air blew out after it like an inverted explosion.Horza opened his eyes again and saw with relief the distant floor of the GSV's cavernous interior, and the climbing figures on the main fusion motors" monitor screens.He hit the engine throttles again, this time leaving the nose motor alone.The two main engines caught, shoving Horza back in his seat against the cloying hold of the restrainer fields.He pulled the nose of the diving craft up, watching the floor far below gradually disappear from view as it was replaced by the sight of another wall of opened bay doors.The doors were much larger than those of the Smallbays in the level they had just left, and the few craft Horza could see either nosing into or appearing out of the lit lengths of the huge hangars were full size starships.Horza watched the screen, piloting the Clear Air Turbulence exactly like an aircraft.They were travelling quickly along a vast corridor over a kilometre across, with the layer of clouds about fifteen hundred metres above them.Starships were moving slowly through the same space, a few on their own AG fields, most towed by light lifter tugs.Everything else was moving slowly and without a fuss; only the CAT disturbed the calm of the giant ship's interior, screaming through the air on twin swords of brilliant flame pulsing from white hot plasma chambers.Another cliff face of huge hangar doors faced them.Horza looked about him at the curve of main screen and pulled the CAT over on a long banking left turn, diving a little at the same time to head down an even broader canyon of space.They flashed over a slow moving clipper being towed towards a distant open Mainbay, rocking the starship in their wake of superheated air.The wall of doors and opened entrances slanted towards them as Horza tightened the turn.Ahead, Horza could see what looked like a cloud of insects: hundreds of tiny black specks floating in the air.Far beyond them, maybe five or six kilometres away, a thousand metre square of blackness, bordered with a slowly flashing strip of subdued white light, was the exit from The Ends of Invention.It was a straight run.Horza sighed and felt his whole body relax.Unless they were intercepted, they had done it.With a little luck now, they might even get away from the Orbital itself.He gunned the engines, heading for the inky square in the distance.Wubslin suddenly sat forward, against the pull of acceleration, and punched some buttons.His repeater screen set in the console magnified the centre section of the main screen, showing the view ahead."They're people!"he shouted.Horza frowned over at the man."What?""People!Those are people!They must be in AG harnesses!We're going to go right through them!"Horza looked briefly over at Wubslin's repeater screen.It was true; the black cloud which almost filled the screen was made up of humans, flying slowly about in suits or ordinary clothes.There were thousands of them, Horza saw, less than a kilometre ahead, and closing quickly.Wubslin was staring at the screen, waving his hand at the people."Get out the way!Get out the way!"he was shouting.Horza couldn't see a way round, over or beneath the mass of flying people.Whether they were playing some curious mass aerial game or were just enjoying themselves, they were too many, too close, too widespread."Shit!"Horza said.He got ready to cut the rear plasma motors before the Clear Air Turbulence went into the cloud of humans.With luck they might make it through before they had to relight them, and so not incinerate too many people."No!"Wubslin screamed.He threw the restraining straps off, leapt across towards Horza and dived at the controls.Horza tried to fend the bulky engineer off, but failed.The controls were wrenched from his hands, and the view on the main screen tipped and swirled, pointing the nose of the speeding ship away from the black square of the GSV exit, away from the huge cloud of airborne people, and towards the cliff of brightly lit Mainbay entrances.Horza clouted Wubslin across the head with his arm, sending the man falling to the floor, stunned.He grabbed the controls back from the relaxing fingers of the engineer, but it was too late to turn away.Horza steadied and aimed.The Clear Air Turbulence darted for an open Mainbay; it flashed through the open entrance and swept over the skeleton of a starship being rebuilt in the bay, the light from the CAT's motors starting fires, singeing hair, smouldering clothes and blinding unprotected eyes.Horza saw Wubslin lying unconscious on the floor out of the corner of his eye, rocking gently as the CAT careered through the half kilometre length of Mainbay.The doors to the next bay were open, and the next and the next.They were flying through a two kilometre tunnel, racing over the repair and docking facilities of one of Evanauth's displaced shipbuilders.Horza didn't know what was at the far end, but he could see that before they got there they would have to fly over the top of a large spaceship which almost filled the third bay along.Horza vectored the fusion fire ahead so that they started to slow.Twin beams of fire flashed on either side of the main screen as the fusion power kicked forward.Wubslin's unrestrained body slid forward on the floor of the bridge, wedging under the console and his own seat.Horza lifted the CAT's nose as the blunt snout of the parked spacecraft sitting in the bay ahead approached.The Clear Air Turbulence zoomed towards the ceiling of the Mainbay, flashed between it and the top surface of the ship, then fell on the other side and, although still slowing, shot through the final Mainbay and into another corridor of free air space.It was too narrow.Horza dived the craft again, saw the floor coming up and fired the lasers.The CAT burst through a rising cloud of glowing wreckage, bumping and shaking, Wubslin's squat frame sliding out from under the console and floating back up towards the rear door of the bridge.At first Horza thought they were out at last, but they weren't; they were in what the Culture called a General bay.The CAT fell once more, then levelled out again.It was in a space which seemed even larger than the main interior of the GSV.It was flying through the bay they had stored the Megaship in: the same Megaship Horza had seen on the screen earlier being lifted out of the water by a hundred or so ancient Culture lifter craft.Horza had time to look around.There was plenty of space, lots of room and time.The Megaship lay on the floor of the giant bay, looking for all the world like a small city sitting on a great slab of metal.The Clear Air Turbulence flew past the stern of the Megaship, past tunnels full of propeller blades tens of metres across, round the side of its rearmost outrigger, where beached pleasure craft waited for a return to water, over the towers and spires of its superstructure, then out over its bows.Horza looked forward.The doors, if they were doors, of the General bay faced him, two kilometres away.They were that same distance from top to bottom, and twice that across.Horza shrugged and checked the laser again.He was becoming, he realised, almost blas about the whole thing.What the hell?he thought.The lasers picked a hole in the wall of material ahead, punching a slowly widening gap which Horza aimed straight for.A vortex of swirling air was starting to form around the hole; as the CAT rushed closer, it was caught in a small horizontal cyclone of air and started to twist.Then it was through, and in space.In a quickly dispersing bubble of air and crystals of ice, the craft burst from the body of the General Systems Vehicle, swooping into vacuum and star washed darkness at last.Behind it, a force field slammed across the hole its passage had created in the doors of the General bay.Horza felt the plasma motors stutter as their supply of outside air disappeared, then the internal tanks took up the slack.He was about to cut them and slide gently into the start up procedure for the craft's warp engines when the speakers in his headrest crackled."This is Evanauth port police.All right, you son of a bitch, just keep on that heading and slow right down.Evanauth port police to rogue craft: halt on that heading.A "  Horza pulled on the controls, taking the CAT on a huge accelerating arc up over the stern of the GSV, flashing past the outside of the kilometre square exit he had been heading for earlier.Wubslin, moaning now, bumped around the inside of the bridge as the CAT lifted its nose to head straight up, towards the maze of abandoned docks and gantries that was Evanauth port.As it went it turned, still twisting slightly from the spin it had picked up from the vortex of air bursting from the General bay.Horza let it twist, steadying it only as they approached the top of the loop, the port facilities coming up fast then sliding underneath as the craft levelled out."Rogue ship!This is your last warning!"the speakers blared."Stop now or we'll blow you out of the sky!God, he's heading for " The transmission cut off.Horza grinned to himself.He was indeed heading for the gap between the underside of the port and the top of the GSY.The Clear Air Turbulence flashed through spaces between traveltube connections, elevator shafts, graving dock gantries, transit areas, arriving shuttle craft and crane towers.Horza guided the ship through the maze with the fusion motors still blazing at maximum boost, throwing the small craft through the few hundred metres of crowded space between the Orbital and the General Systems Vehicle.The rear radar pinged, picking up following echoes.Two towers, hanging under the Orbital like upside down sky scrapers, between which Horza was aiming the CAT, suddenly blossomed with light, scattering wreckage.Horza cringed in his seat as he corkscrewed the ship into the space between the two clouds of debris."Those were across the bows," crackled the speakers again."The next ones will be straight up your ass, boy racer. "The CAT shot out over the dull grey plain of slanting material that was the start of the Ends" nose.Horza turned the CAT over and dived down, following the slope of the vast craft's bows.The rear radar signal stopped briefly, then reappeared.He flipped the ship over again.Wubslin, his arms and legs waving weakly, was dumped onto the CAT's bridge ceiling and stuck there like a fly while Horza did a section of an outside loop.The ship was racing, powering away from the Orbital port area and the big GSV, heading for space.Horza remembered about Balveda's gear, and quickly reached over to the console, closing the vactube circuit from there.A screen showed that all the vactubes had been rotated.The rear screen showed something flame inside the twin plumes of plasma fire.The rear radar pinged insistently."Goodbye, stupid!"the voice in the headrest speakers said.Horza threw the ship to one side.The rear screen went white, then black.The main screen pulsated with colours and broken lines.The speakers in Horza's helmet, as well as the speakers set into the seat, howled.Every instrument on the console flashed and wavered.Horza thought for a second they had been hit, but the motors were still blasting, the main screen was starting to clear, and the other instruments were recovering, too.The radiation meters were bleeping and flashing.The rear screen stayed blank.A damage monitor indicated that the sensors had been knocked out by a very strong pulse of radiation.Horza started to realise what had happened when the rear radar didn't start pinging again after it recovered.He threw back his head and laughed.There had indeed been a bomb in Balveda's kitbag.Whether it had gone off because it was caught in the CAT's plasma exhaust or because somebody  whoever had been trying to keep the ship on board the GSV in the first place  had detonated it remotely the instant the fleeing craft was far enough away from the Ends not to cause too much damage, Horza didn't know.Whatever; the explosion seemed to have caught the pursuing police vessels.Laughing uproariously, Horza angled the CAT further away from the great circle of brilliantly lit Orbital, heading straight out towards the stars and readying the warp engines to take over from the plasma motors.Wubslin, back on the deck, one leg caught on the arm of his own chair, moaned distantly."Mother," he said."Mother, say it's only a dream"  Horza laughed louder."You lunatic," breathed Yalson, shaking her head.Her eyes were wide."That was the craziest thing I've ever seen you do.You're mad, Kraiklyn.I'm leaving.I resign as of now Shit!I wish I'd gone with Jandraligeli, to Ghalssel You can just drop me off first place we get to. "Horza sat down wearily in the seat at the head of the mess room table.Yalson was at the far end, under the screen, which was switched into the bridge main screen.The CAT was proceeding under full warp, two hours out on its journey from Vavatch.There had been no further pursuit following the destruction of the police craft, and now the CAT was gradually coming round to the course Horza had set, into the war zone, towards the edge of the Glittercliff, towards Schar's World.Dorolow and Aviger were sitting, plainly still shaken, to one side of Yalson.The woman and the elderly man were both staring at Horza as though he was pointing a gun at them.Their mouths were open, their eyes were glazed.On the other side of Yalson the slack form of Perosteck Balveda was leaning forward, head down, her body pulling against the restraining straps of the seat.The mess room was chaotic.The CAT hadn't been readied for violent manoeuvring, and nothing had been stowed away.Plates and containers, a couple of shoes, a glove, some half unravelled tapes and spools and various other bits and pieces now lay strewn about the floor of the mess.Yalson had been hit by something, and a small trickle of blood had dried on her forehead.Horza hadn't let anybody move, apart from brief visits to the heads, for the last two hours; he'd told everybody to stay where they were over the ship PA while the CAT headed away from Vavatch on a twisting, erratic course.He had kept the plasma motors and laser warm and ready, but no further pursuit came.Now he reckoned they were safe and far enough away to warp straight.He had left Wubslin on the bridge, nursing the battered and abused systems of the Clear Air Turbulence as best he could.The engineer had apologised for grabbing at the controls and had become very subdued, not meeting Horza's eyes but tidying up one or two bits of loose debris on the bridge and stuffing some of the loose wires back under the console.Horza told Wubslin he had nearly killed them all, but on the other hand so had he, so they would forget it this time; they'd escaped intact.Wubslin nodded and said he didn't know how; he couldn't believe the ship was virtually undamaged.Wubslin wasn't undamaged; he had bruises everywhere."I'm afraid," Horza said to Yalson once he had sat down and put his feet up, "our first port of call is rather bleak and underpopulated.I'm not sure you'll want to be dropped off there. "Yalson put the heavy stun pistol down onto the table surface."And just where the hell are we going?What's going on, Kraiklyn?What was all that craziness back on the GSV?What's she doing here?Why is the Culture involved?"Yalson nodded at Balveda during this speech, and Horza kept looking at the unconscious Culture agent when Yalson stopped, waiting for an answer.Aviger and Dorolow were looking at him expectantly, too.Before Horza could answer, the small drone appeared from the corridor leading from the accommodation section.It floated in, looked round the mess room, then sat itself bodily on the table in the middle."Did I hear something about it being explanation time?"it said.It was facing Horza.Horza looked away from Balveda, to Aviger and Dorolow, then to Yalson and the drone."Well, you might as well all know that we are now heading for a place called Schar's World.It's a Planet of the Dead. "Yalson looked puzzled.Aviger said, "I've heard of those.But we won't be allowed in. ""This is getting worse," the drone said."If I were you, Captain Kraiklyn, I would turn back to The Ends of Invention and surrender yourself there.I'm sure you'd get a fair trial. "Horza ignored the machine.He sighed, looking round at the mess, stretched his legs and yawned."I'm sorry you're all being taken, perhaps against your will, but I've got to get there, and I can't afford to stop anywhere to let you off.You've all got to come. ""Oh we do, do we?"said the small drone."Yes," Horza said, looking at it, "I'm afraid so. ""But we won't be able to get anywhere near this place," Aviger protested."They don't let anybody in.There's some sort of zone around them they don't let people into. ""We'll see about that when we get there. "Horza smiled."You're not answering my questions," Yalson said.She looked at Balveda again, then down at the gun lying on the table."I've been zapping this poor bitch every time she flicks an eyelid, and I want to know why I've been doing it. ""It'll take a while to explain it all, but what it boils down to is there's something on Schar's World which both the Culture and the Idirans want.I have a contract, a commission from the Idirans, to get there and find this thing. ""You really are a paranoid," the drone said incredulously.It rose off the table and turned round to look at the others."He really is a lunatic!""The Idirans are hiring us  you  to go after something?"Yalson's voice was full of disbelief.Horza looked at her and smiled."You mean this woman', Dorolow said, pointing at Balveda, "was sent by the Culture to join us, infiltrate Are you serious?""I'm serious.Balveda was looking for me.Also for Horza Gobuchul.She wanted to get to Schar's World, or to stop us from getting there. "Horza looked at Aviger."There was a bomb in amongst her gear, by the way; it went off just after I rotated it out the tubes.It blew the police ships away.We all got a blast of radiation, but nothing lethal. ""And what about Horza?"Yalson said, looking grimly at him."Was that just some trick, or did you really meet him?""He is alive, Yalson, and as safe as any of us. "Wubslin appeared through the door from the bridge, still with an apologetic look on his face.He nodded at Horza and sat down near by."All looking fine, Kraiklyn. ""Good," Horza said."I was just explaining to everybody else about our journey to Schar's World. ""Oh," Wubslin said."Yeah. "He shrugged at the others."Kraiklyn," Yalson said, leaning forward on the table and looking intently at Horza, "you just about got us all killed fuck knows how many times back there.You probably did kill quite a few people during those in door aerobatics.You've saddled us with some secret agent from the Culture.You're practically kidnapping us to take us towards a planet in the middle of a war zone where nobody's even allowed in, to look for something both sides want enough to Well, if the Idirans are hiring a decimated bunch of second rate mercenaries, they must be pretty desperate; and if the Culture really was behind the attempt to keep us in that bay, they must be scared stiff to risk violating the neutrality of the Ends and breaking some of their precious rules of war."You may think you know what's going on and think the risk is worth it, but I don't, and I don't like this feeling of being kept in the dark at all, either.Your track record recently's been crap; let's face it.Risk your own life if you want to, but you don't have any right to risk ours, too.Not any more.Maybe we don't all want to side with the Idirans, but even if we did prefer them to the Culture, none of us signed up to start fighting in the middle of the war.Shit, Kraiklyn, we're neither equipped nor trained well enough to go up against those guys. ""I know all that," Horza said."But we shouldn't be encountering any battle forces.The Quiet Barrier round Schar's World extends far enough out so that it's impossible to watch it all.We go in from a randomly picked direction, and by the time we're spotted, there's nothing anybody could do about it, no matter what sort of ship they have.A Main Battle Fleet couldn't keep us out.When we leave it'll be the same. ""What you're trying to say is," Yalson said, sitting back in her seat, " "Easy in, easy out". ""Maybe I am," laughed Horza."Hey," Wubslin said suddenly, looking at his terminal screen, which he had just taken from his pocket."It's nearly time!"He got up and disappeared through the doors leading to the bridge.In a few seconds the screen in the mess changed, the view swivelling round until it showed Vavatch.The great Orbital hung in space, dark and brilliant, full of night and day, blue and white and black.They all looked up at the screen.Wubslin came back in and sat in his seat again.Horza felt tired.His body wanted rest, and lots of it.His brain was still buzzing from the concentration and the amount of adrenalin it had required to pilot the CAT through and out of The Ends of Invention, but he couldn't rest yet.He couldn't decide what was the best thing to do.Should he tell them who he was, tell them the truth, that he was a Changer, that he had killed Kraiklyn?How loyal were any of them to the leader they didn't yet know was dead?Yalson the most, perhaps; but surely she would be glad to know that he was alive Yet she was the one who had said that perhaps they weren't all on the Idirans" side She had never shown any sympathy for the Culture before when he had known her, but perhaps she had changed her mind.He could even Change back; there was a fairly long journey now during which it shouldn't be beyond him, perhaps with the help of Wubslin, to change the fidelities in the CAT's computer.But should he tell them  should he let them know?And Balveda: what was he going to do with her?He had had some idea of using her to bargain with the Culture, but it looked as though they had escaped now, and next stop was Schar's World, where she would at best be a liability.He ought to kill her now, but he knew, first of all, that that might not go down well with the others, especially Yalson.He also knew, although he didn't like to admit it, that he would find it personally painful to kill the Culture agent.They were enemies, they had both been very close to death and the other had done little or nothing to intervene, but actually to kill her would be very difficult.Or maybe he only wanted to pretend that he would find it very difficult; maybe it would be no bother at all, and the sort of bogus camaraderie of doing the same job, though on different sides, was just that: a fake.He opened his mouth to ask Yalson to stun the Culture agent again."Now," Wubslin said.With that, Vavatch Orbital started to disintegrate.The view of it on the mess room screen was a compensated hyperspace version, so that, although they were already outside the Vavatch system, they were watching it virtually in real time.Right at the appointed hour the unseen, unnamed, very much still militarised General Systems Vehicle which was somewhere in the vicinity of the Vavatch planetary system started its bombardment.It was almost certainly an Ocean class GSV, the same one which had sent the message that they had all watched some days ago on the mess screen, heading in towards Vavatch.That would make the warcraft very much smaller than the behemoth of The Ends of Invention, which was  for war purposes  obsolete.One Ocean class could fit inside either of the Ends" General bays, but while the larger craft  by that time an hour out from the Orbital  was full of people, the Ocean class would be packed with other warships, and weaponry.Gridfire struck the Orbital.Horza paused and watched the screen as it lit up suddenly, flashing once over its whole surface until the sensors coped with the sudden increase in brilliance and compensated.For some reason Horza had thought the Culture would just splash the gridfire all over the massive Orbital and then spatter the remains with CAM, but they didn't do that; instead a single narrow line of blinding white light appeared right across the breadth of the day side of the Orbital, a thin fiery blade of silent destruction which was instantly surrounded by the duller but still perfectly white cover of clouds.That line of light was part of the grid itself, the fabric of pure energy which lay underneath the entire universe, separating this one from the slightly younger, slightly smaller antimatter universe beneath.The Culture, like the Idirans, could now partially control that awesome power, at least sufficiently to use it for the purposes of destruction.A line of that energy, plucked from nowhere and sliced across the face of the three dimensional universe, was down there: on and inside the Orbital, boiling the Circlesea, melting the two thousand kilometres of transparent wall, annihilating the base material itself, straight across its thirty five thousand kilometre breadth.Vavatch, that fourteen million kilometre hoop, was starting to uncoil.A chain, it had been cut.There was nothing left now to hold it together; its own spin, the source of both its day night cycle and its artificial gravity, was now the very force tearing it all apart.At about one hundred and thirty kilometres per second, Vavatch was throwing itself into outer space, unwinding like a released spring.The livid line of fire appeared again, and again, and again, working its way methodically round the Orbital from where the original burst had struck, neatly parcelling the entire Orbital into squares, thirty five thousand kilometres to a side, each containing a sandwich of trillions upon trillions of tonnes of ultradense base material, water, land and air.Vavatch was turning white.First the gridfire seared the water into a border of clouds; then the outrushing air, spilling from each immense flat square like heavy fumes off a table, turned its load of water vapour to ice.The ocean itself, no longer held by the spin force, was shifting, spilling with infinite slowness over one edge of every plate of ruptured base material, becoming ice and swirling away into space.The precise, brilliant line of fire marched on, going back in reverse spin direction, neatly dissecting the still curved, still spinning sections of the Orbital with its sudden, lethal flashes of light  light from outside the normal fabric of reality.Horza remembered what Jandraligeli had called it, back when Lenipobra had been enthusing about the destruction."The weaponry of the end of the universe," the Mondlidician had said.Horza watched the screen and knew what the man had meant.It was all going.All of it.The wreck of the Olmedreca, the tabular berg it had collided with, the wreck of the CAT's shuttle, Mipp's body, Lenipobra's, whatever was left of Fwi Song's corpse, Mr First's the living bodies of the other Eaters  if they hadn't been rescued, or had still refused the Damage game arena, the docks and Kraiklyn's dead body, the hovercraft animals and fishes, birds, germs, all of it: everything flash burned or flash frozen, suddenly weightless, spinning into space, going, dying.The relentless line of fire completed its circuit of the Orbital, back almost to where it had started.The Orbital was now a rosette of white flat squares backing slowly away from each other towards the stars: four hundred separate slabs of quickly freezing water, silt, land and base material, angling out above or underneath the plane of the system's planets like flat square worlds themselves.There was a moment of grace then, as Vavatch died in solitary, blazing splendour.Then at its dark centre, another blazing star patch rose, bursting white as the Hub was struck with the same terrible energy which had smashed the world itself.Like a target, then, Vavatch blazed.Just as Horza thought that the Culture would be content with that, the screen lit up once more.Everyone of those flat cards, and the Hub, of the exploded Orbital blazed once with an icy, sparkling brilliance as though a million tiny white stars were shining through each shattered piece.The light faded, and those four hundred expanses of flat worlds with their centre Hub were gone, replaced by a grid of diced shapes, each exploding away from the others as well as from the rest of the disintegrating Orbital.Those pieces flashed, too, bursting slowly with a billion pinpricks of light which, when they faded, left debris almost too small to make out.Vavatch was now a swollen and spiralled disc of flashing, glittering splinters, expanding very slowly against the distant stars like a ring of bright dust.The glinting, sparkling centre made it look like some huge, lidless and unblinking eye.The screen flashed one final time.No single points of light could be made out this time.It was as though the whole now vague but bloated image of the shattered circular world glowed with some internal heat, making a torus shaped cloud out of it, a halo of white light with a fading iris at its centre.Then the show was over, and only the sun lit up the slowly blooming nimbus of the annihilated world.On other wavelengths there would probably be a lot still to see, but the mess room screen was on normal light.Only the Minds, only the starships, would see the whole destruction perfectly; only they would be able to appreciate it for all that it had to offer.Of the entire range of the electromagnetic spectrum, the unaided human eye could see little more than one per cent: a single octave of radiation out of an immense long keyboard of tones.The sensors on a starship would see everything, right across that spectrum, in far greater detail and at a much slower apparent speed.The whole display that was the Orbital's destruction was, for all its humanly perceivable grandeur, quite wasted on the animal eye.A spectacle for the machines, thought Horza; that was all it was.A sideshow for the damn machines."Chicel" Dorolow said.Wubslin exhaled loudly and shook his head.Yalson turned and looked at Horza.Aviger stayed with his head turned to the screen."Amazing what one can accomplish when one puts one's mind to it, eh Horza?"At first, stupidly, he thought that Yalson had said it, but of course it was Balveda.She brought her head up slowly.Her deep, dark eyes were open; she looked groggy, and her body still sagged against the webbing of the seat straps.The voice had been clear and steady, though.Horza saw Yalson reaching for the stun gun on the table.She reached out and brought the gun closer to her but left it lying on the table.She was looking suspiciously at the Culture agent.Aviger and Dorolow and Wubslin were staring at her, too."Are the batteries on that stun gun running down?"Wubslin said.Yalson was still looking at Balveda, her eyes narrowed."You're a little confused, Gravant, or whoever you are," Yalson said."That's Kraiklyn. "Balveda smiled at Horza.He left his face blank.He didn't know what to do.He was exhausted, worn out.It was too much of an effort.Let what was going to happen, happen.He'd had enough of deciding."Well," Balveda said to him, "are you going to tell them, or shall I?"He said nothing.He watched Balveda's face.The woman drew a deep breath and said, "Oh all right, I'll tell them. "She turned to Yalson."His name is Bora Horza Gobuchul, and he's impersonating Kraiklyn.Horza's a Changer from Heibohre and he works for the Idirans.Has done for the last six years.He's Changed to become Kraiklyn.I imagine your real leader is dead.Horza probably killed him, or at least left him somewhere in or around Evanauth."I'm very sorry. "She looked around the others, including the small drone."But unless I'm much mistaken we're all taking a little trip to a place called Schar's World.Well, you are, anyway.I have a feeling my own journey might be a little shorter  and infinitely longer. "Balveda smiled ironically at Horza."Two?"the drone on the table said to nobody in particular."I'm stuck in a leaky museum piece with two paranoid lunatics?""You're not," Yalson was saying, ignoring the machine and gazing at Horza."You're not, are you?She's lying. "Wubslin turned and looked at him.Aviger and Dorolow exchanged glances.Horza sighed and took his feet off the table, sitting a little straighter in his seat.He leaned forward and put his elbows on the table, his chin in his hands.He was watching, feeling, trying to gauge the mood of the various people in the room.He was aware of their distances, the tension in their bodies, and how much time he would need to get to the plasma pistol on his right hip.He raised his head and looked at all of them, settling his gaze on Yalson."Yes," he said, "I am. "Silence filled the mess room.Horza waited for a reaction.Instead the sound of a door opening came from down the corridor through the accommodation section.They all looked at the doorway.Neisin appeared, wearing only a pair of grubby, stained shorts.His hair was sticking out in every direction, his eyes were slits, his skin was patchy with dry and moist areas, and his face was very pale.A smell of drink gradually worked its way through the mess.He looked round the room, yawned, nodded at them, pointed vaguely at some of the still uncleared debris lying around and said, "This place is nearly in as big a mess as my cabin.You'd think we'd been manoeuvring or something.Sorry.Thought it was time to eat.Think I'll go back to bed. "He yawned again and left.The door closed.Balveda was laughing quietly.Horza could see some tears in her eyes.The others just looked confused.The drone said:  "Well, Mr Observant there is probably the only person on this mobile asylum with an untroubled mind at the moment. "The machine turned on the table, scratching the surface as it faced Horza."Are you really claiming to be one of these fabled human impersonators?"it asked with a sneer in its voice.Horza looked down the table, then into Yalson's wary, frowning eyes."That's what I am. ""They're extinct," Aviger said, shaking his head."They're not extinct," Balveda told him, her thin, finely moulded head turning briefly to the old man."But they're part of the Idiran sphere now; absorbed.Some of them always did support the Idirans, the rest either left or decided they might as well throw in their lot with them.Horza's one of the first lot.Can't stand the Culture.He's taking you all to Schar's World to kidnap a shipwrecked Mind for his Idiran masters.A Culture Mind.So that the galaxy will be free from human interference and the Idirans can have a free run at "  "All right, Balveda," Horza said.She shrugged."You're Horza," Yalson said, pointing at him.He nodded.She shook her head."I don't believe it.I'm starting to come round to the drone's way of thinking; you're both crazy.You took a nasty blow to the head, Kraiklyn, and you, lady"  she looked at Balveda  "have had your brains scrambled by this thing. "Yalson picked up the stun gun and then put it down again."I don't know," Wubslin said, scratching his head and looking at Horza as though he was some sort of exhibit."I thought the captain seemed a bit strange.I couldn't imagine him doing what he just did in the GSV. ""What did you do, Horza?"Balveda said."I seem to have missed something.How did you get away?""I flew out, Balveda.Used the fusion motors and the laser and blasted out. ""Really?"Balveda laughed again, throwing her head back.She went on laughing, but her laughter was a little too loud, and the tears were coming too quickly to her eyes."Ho ho.Well, I am impressed.I thought we had you. ""When did you find out?"he asked her quietly.She sniffed and tried to wipe her nose on her shoulder."What?That you weren't Kraiklyn?"She played her tongue along her top lip."Oh, just before you came aboard.We had a microdrone pretending to be a fly.It was programmed to land on anybody approaching the ship while it was in the Smallbay and take a skin cell or hair or something away with it.We identified you from your own chromosomes.There was another agent outside; he must have used his effector on the bay controls when he monitored you starting to get ready to leave.I was supposed to do whatever I could if you appeared.Kill you, capture you, disable the ship: anything.But they didn't tell me until too late.They knew somebody might overhear if they warned me, but they must have started to get worried. ""That was the noise you heard from her kitbag," Horza told Yalson, "just before I zapped her. "He looked back at Balveda."I got rid of the gear, by the way, Balveda.Dumped it all through the vactubes.Your bomb went off. "Balveda seemed to sag a little further in her seat.He guessed that she had been hoping her gear was on board.At the very least she might have been hoping the bomb had still to be triggered and that, while she would die, she would not die in vain, or alone."Oh yes," she said, looking down at the table, "the vactubes. ""What about Kraiklyn?"Yalson asked."He's dead," Horza said."I killed him. ""Oh well," Yalson tutted, and rapped her fingers on the table surface."That's that.I don't know if you two really are mad or if you're telling the truth; both possibilities are pretty awful. "She looked from Balveda to Horza, raising her eyebrows at the man and saying, "By the way, if you really are Horza, it's a lot less pleasant to see you back than I thought it was going to be. ""I'm sorry," he told her.She turned her head away from him."I still think the best thing to do is to head back for The Ends of Invention and lay the whole thing before the authorities. "The drone rose fractionally above the surface of the table and looked round at them all.Horza leant forward and tapped its casing.It faced him."Machine," he said, "we're going to Schar's World.If you want to go back to the GSV I'll gladly put you in a vactube and let you make your own way back.But you mention returning and getting a fair trial one more time and I'm going to blast your synthetic fucking brains out, understand?""How dare you speak to me like that!"the drone bellowed."I'll have you know I am an Accredited Free Construct, certified sentient under the Free Will Acts by the Greater Vavatch United Moral Standards Administration and with full citizenship of the Vavatch Heterocracy.I am near to paying off my Incurred Generation Debt, when I'll be free to do exactly what I like, and have already been accepted for a degree course in applied paratheology at the University of "  "Will you shut your goddamn speaker and listen?"Horza shouted, breaking into the machine's breathless monologue."We're not on Vavatch, and I don't care how god damn smart you are, or how many qualifications you've got.You're on this ship and you do as I say.You want to get off?Get off now and float back to whatever's left of your precious fucking Orbital.Stay, and you obey orders.Or get junked. ""Those are my choices?""Yes.Use some of your accredited free will and decide right now. ""I" The drone rose from the table, then sank again."Hmm," it said."Very well.I shall stay. ""And obey all orders. ""And obey all orders"  "Good, at "  " within reason. ""Machine," Horza said, reaching for the plasma pistol."Oh good grief, man!"the drone exclaimed."What do you want?A robot?"Its voice sneered."I don't have an Off button on my reasoning functions; I can't choose not to have free will.I could quite easily swear to obey all orders regardless of the consequences; I could vow to sacrifice my life for you if you asked me to; but I'd be lying, so that I could live."I swear to be as obedient and faithful as any of your human crew in fact as the most obedient and faithful of them.For pity's sake, man, in the name of all reason, what more can you ask?"Sneaky bastard.Horza thought."Well," he said, "I suppose that will just have to do.Now, can "  "But I am obliged to serve immediate notice on you that under the terms of my Retrospective Construction Agreement, my Incurred Generation Debt Loan Agreement and my Employment Contract, your forcible removal of myself from my place of work makes you liable for the servicing of said debt until my return, as well as risking civil and criminal proceedings "  "Fucking hell, drone," Yalson interrupted."Sure it wasn't law you were going to study?""I take full responsibility, machine," Horza told it."Now, shut ,"  "Well, I hope you're properly insured," the drone muttered."up!""Horza?"Balveda said."Yes, Perosteck?"He turned to her with a sense of relief.Her eyes were glittering.She licked her top lip again, then looked back at the surface of the table, her head down."What about me?""Well," he said slowly, "it did cross my mind to blow you out a vactube" He saw her tense.Yalson, too: she turned in her seat to face him, clenching her fists and opening her mouth.Horza went on, " But you may be of some use yet, and oh, call it sentiment. "He smiled."You'll have to behave, of course. "Balveda looked up at him.There was hope in her eyes, but also the piteousness of those who don't want to hope too soon."You mean that, I hope," she said quietly.Horza nodded."I mean it.I couldn't possibly get rid of you anyway, before I find out how the hell you got off The Hand of God. "Balveda relaxed, breathing deeply.When she laughed it was softly.Yalson was looking with a jaundiced expression at Horza and still rapping her fingers on the table."Yalson," Horza said, "I'd like you and Dorolow to take Balveda and strip her.Take her suit and everything else off. "He was aware of them all looking at him.Balveda was arching her eyebrows with faked shock.He went on, "I want you to take the surgery equipment and run every sort of test you can on her once she's naked to make sure she hasn't got any skin pouches, implants or prosthetics; use the ultrasound and the X ray gear and the NMR and anything else we've got.Once you've done that you can find something for her to wear.Put her suit in a vactube and dump it.Also any jewellery or other personal possessions of any sort or size, regardless of how innocent they may look. ""You want her washed and anointed, put in a white robe and placed on a stone altar, too?"Yalson said acidly.Horza shook his head."I want her clean of anything, anything at all that could be used as a weapon or that could turn into one.The Culture's latest gadgetry for the Special Circumstancers includes things called memoryforms; they might looked like a badge, or a medallion" He smiled at Balveda, who nodded back wryly, " or anything else.But do a certain something to them  touch them in the right place, make them wet, speak a certain word  and they become a communicator, a gun or a bomb.I don't want to risk there being anything more dangerous than Ms Balveda herself on board. ""What about when we get to Schar's World?"Balveda said."We'll give you some warm clothes.If you wrap up well, you'll be all right.No suit, no weapons. ""And the rest of us?"asked Aviger."What are we supposed to do when you get to this place?Assuming they'll let you in, which I doubt. ""I'm not sure yet," Horza said truthfully."Maybe you'll have to come with me.I'll have to see what I can do about the ship's fidelities.Possibly you'll all be able to stay on board; perhaps you'll all have to hit dirt with me.However, there are some other Changers there, people like myself but not working for the Idirans.They should be able to look after you if I'm to be gone for any amount of time.Of course," he said, looking at Yalson, "if any of you want to come along with me, I'm sure that we can treat this as a normal operation in terms of share outs and so forth.Once I'm finished with the CAT, those of you who so desire may want to take it over for yourselves, run it any way you like; sell it if you want; it's up to you.At any rate, you'll all be free to do as you wish, once I've accomplished my mission on Schar's World  or done my best to, at least. "Yalson had been looking at him, but now she turned away, shaking her head.Wubslin was looking at the deck.Aviger and Dorolow stared at each other.The drone was silent."Now," Horza said, rising stiffly, "Yalson and Dorolow, if you wouldn't mind seeing to Ms Balveda" With a show of some reluctance, Yalson sighed and got up.Dorolow started to undo some of the restraining straps around the Culture agent's body."And do be very careful with her," Horza continued."Keep one person well away from her with the gun pointed in her direction the whole time, while the other does the work. "Yalson muttered something under her breath and leaned to pick up the stun gun from the table.Horza turned to Aviger."I think somebody should tell Neisin about all the excitement he's missed, don't you?"Aviger hesitated, then nodded."Yes, Kraik " He stopped, spluttered, then said no more.He got up from his seat and went quickly down the corridor towards the cabins."I think I'll open up the forward compartments and have a look at the laser, Kraiklyn, if that's all right with you," Wubslin said."Oh, I mean Horza. "The engineer stood, frowning and scratching his head.Horza nodded.Wubslin found a clean undamaged beaker and took a cold drink from the dispenser, then went down the corridor through the accommodation section.Dorolow and Yalson had freed Balveda.The tall, pale skinned Culture woman stretched, closing her eyes and arching her neck.She ran a hand through her short red hair.Dorolow watched warily.Yalson held the stun gun.Balveda flexed her shoulders, then indicated she was ready."Right," Yalson said, waving Balveda forward with the gun."We'll do this in my cabin. "Horza stood up to let the three women by.As Balveda passed, her long, easy stride unencumbered by the light suit, he said, "How did you get off The Hand of God, Balveda?"She stopped and said, "I killed the guard and then sat and waited, Horza.The GCU managed to take the cruiser intact.Eventually some nice soldier drones came and rescued me. "She shrugged."Unarmed, you killed an Idiran in full battle armour and toting a laser?"Horza said sceptically.Balveda shrugged again."Horza, I didn't say it was easy. ""What about Xoralundra?"Horza asked through a grin."Your old Idiran friend?Must have escaped.A few of them did.At any rate, he wasn't among the dead or captured. "Horza nodded and waved her by.Followed by Yalson and Dorolow, Perosteck Balveda went down the corridor to Yalson's cabin.Horza looked at the drone sitting on the table."Think you can make yourself useful, machine?""I suppose, as you obviously intend to keep us all here and take us to this unattractive sounding rockball on the edge of nowhere, I might as well do what I can to make the journey as safe as possible.I'll help with the vessel's maintenance, if you like.I would prefer, though, if you called me by my name, and not just by that word you manage to make sound like an expletive: machine.I am called Unaha Closp.Is it asking too much for you to address me as such?""Why, certainly not, Unaha Closp," Horza said, trying to look and sound sufficiently bogus in his abjection."I shall most assuredly ensure that I call you that in future. ""It might," the drone said, rising from the table to the level of Horza's eyes, "seem amusing to you, but it matters to me.I am not just a computer, I am a drone.I am conscious and I have an individual identity.Therefore I have a name. ""I told you I'd use it," Horza said."Thank you.I shall go and see if your engineer needs any help inspecting the laser housing. "It floated to the door.Horza watched it go.He was alone.He sat down and looked at the screen, down at the far end of the mess.The debris that had been Vavatch glowed with a barren glare; that vast cloud of matter was still visible.But it was cooling, dead and spinning away; becoming less real, more ghostly, less substantial all the time.He sat back and closed his eyes.He would wait a while before going to sleep.He wanted to give the others time to think about what they had found out.They would be easier to read then; he would know if he was safe for the moment or whether he would have to watch them all.He also wanted to wait until Yalson and Dorolow had finished with Balveda.The Culture agent might be biding her time, now she thought she had longer to live, but she might still try something.He wanted to be awake in case she did.He still hadn't decided whether to kill her now or not, but at least he, too, now had time to think.The Clear Air Turbulence completed its last programmed course correction, swinging its nose towards the Glittercliff face; not in the precise direction of the Schar's World star, but onto the general bearing.Behind it, still expanding, still radiating, still slowly dissolving in the system to which it had given its name, the unnumbered twinkling fragments of the Orbital called Vavatch blew out towards the stars, drifting on a stellar wind that rang and swirled with the fury of the world's destruction.Horza sat alone in the mess room a little longer, watching the remnants dissipate.Light against the darkness, a fat torus of nothing, just debris.An entire world just wiped out.Not merely destroyed  the very first cut of the Grid energies would have been enough to do that  but obliterated, taken carefully, precisely, artistically apart; annihilation made into an aesthetic experience.The arrogant grace of it, the absolute zero coldness of that sophisticated viciousness it impressed almost as much as it appalled.Even he would admit to a certain reluctant admiration.The Culture had not wasted its lesson to the Idirans and the rest of the galactic community.It had turned even that ghastly waste of effort and skill into a thing of beauty But it was a message it would regret, Horza thought, as the hyper light sped and the ordinary light crawled through the galaxy.This was what the Culture offered, this was its signal, its advertisement, its legacy: chaos from order, destruction from construction, death from life.Vavatch would be more than its own monument; it would commemorate, too, the final, grisly manifestation of the Culture's lethal idealism, the overdue acknowledgement that not only was it no better than any other society, it was much, much worse.They sought to take the unfairness out of existence, to remove the mistakes in the transmitted message of life which gave it any point or advancement (a memory of darkness swept through him, and he shivered) But theirs was the ultimate mistake, the final error, and it would be their undoing.Horza considered going to the bridge to switch the view on the screen to real space, and so see the Orbital intact again, as it had been a few weeks before when the real light the CAT was now travelling through had left the place.But he shook his head slowly, though there was nobody there to see, and watched the quiet screen at the far end of the disordered and deserted room instead.State of play: two  The yacht dropped anchor within a wooded bay.The water was clear, and ten metres beneath the sparkling waves the sandy floor of the anchorage was visible.Tall everblues were spread in a rough crescent around the small inlet, their dusty looking roots sometimes visible on the ochre sandstone they clung to.There were some small cliffs of the same rock, sprinkled with bright flowers and overlooking golden beaches.The white yacht, its long reflection flickering on the water like a silent flame, feathered its tall sails and swung slowly into the faint breeze coming through one arm of the woods and over the cupped bay.People took small canoes or dinghies to the shore, or jumped into the warm water and swam.Some of the ceerevells, which had escorted the yacht on its voyage from its home port, stayed to play in the bay; their long red bodies slipped through the water under and around the vessel's hull, and their snorting breath echoed from the low cliffs facing the water.Sometimes they nudged the boats heading for the shore, and a few of the swimmers played with the sleek animals, diving to swim with them, touch them, hold onto them.The shouts of the people in the boats drew gradually further away.They beached the small craft and disappeared into the woods, going to explore the uninhabited island.The small waves of the inland sea lapped at the disturbed sand.Fal "Ngeestra sighed and, after walking once around the yacht, sat down near the stem on a padded seat.She played absently with one of the ropes tied between the stanchions, rubbing it with her hand.The boy who had been talking to her during the morning, when the yacht was sailing slowly out from the mainland towards the islands, saw her sitting there, and came to talk to her."Aren't you going to look at the island?"he said.He was very thin and light looking.His skin was a deep, almost golden yellow.There was a sheen about it which made Fal think of a hologram because it looked somehow deeper than his skinny arms and legs were thick."I don't feel like it," Pal said.She hadn't wanted the boy to talk to her earlier and she didn't want to talk to him now.She was sorry she'd agreed to come on the cruise."Why not?"the boy said.She couldn't remember his name.She hadn't been paying attention when he started talking to her, and she wasn't even sure he had told her his name, though she assumed he had."I just don't. "She shrugged.She wasn't looking at him."Oh," he said.He was silent for a while.She was aware of the sunlight reflecting from his body, but she still didn't turn to look at him.She watched the distant trees, the waves, the ruddy bodies of the ceerevells hump backing on the surface of the water as they rose to vent and then dive again.The boy said, "I know how you feel. ""Do you?"she said, and turned to look at him.He looked a little surprised.He nodded."You're fed up, aren't you?""Maybe," she said, looking away again."A little bit. ""Why does that old drone follow you about everywhere?"She darted a glance at the boy.Jase was below decks just then, getting a drink for her.It had come aboard at the port with her and had stayed not too far away all the time  the hovering, protective way it usually did.She shrugged again and watched a flock of birds rise from the interior of the island.They called and dipped and wheeled in the air."It looks after me," she said.She stared at her hands, watching the sunlight reflect from her nails."Do you need looking after?""No. ""Then why does it look after you?""I don't know. ""You're very mysterious, you know," he said.She wasn't looking, but she thought she heard a smile in his voice.She shrugged soundlessly."You're like that island," he said."You're strange and mysterious like it is. "Fal snorted and tried to look scathing; then she saw Jase appearing from a doorway, carrying a glass.She got up quickly, followed by the boy, walked down the deck, and met the old drone, taking the glass from it and smiling at it gratefully.She buried her face in the container and sipped at the drink, looking out through the glass at the boy."Well, hello, young man," Jase said."Aren't you going to have a look at the island?"Fal wanted to kick the machine because of its hearty voice and the way it had said almost what the boy had said to her."I might," the boy said, looking at her."You should," Jase said, starting to float towards the stern.The old machine extended a curved field, like a shadow without something to cast it, out from its casing and round the boy's shoulders."By the way, I couldn't help overhearing you when you were talking earlier," it said, gently guiding the boy down the deck.His golden head turned over his shoulder to look at Fal, who was still drinking her drink very slowly, and just starting to follow Jase and the boy, a couple of paces behind.The boy looked away from her and towards the drone at his side, which was saying, "You were talking about not getting into Contact"  "That's right. "The boy's voice was suddenly defensive."I was talking about that, so?"Fal continued to walk behind the drone and the boy.She smacked her lips.Ice in the glass clinked."You sounded bitter," Jase said."I'm not bitter," the boy said quickly."I just think it isn't fair, that's all. ""That you weren't picked?"Jase asked.They were approaching the seats round the stern where Fal had sat a few minutes earlier."Well, yes.It's all I've ever wanted, and I think they made a mistake.I know I'd be good.I thought with the war and all that they would need more people. ""Well, yes.But Contact has far more applicants than it can use. ""But I thought one of the things that they considered was how much you wanted to get in, and I know nobody could have wanted to get in as much as I do.Ever since I can remember I've wanted" The boy's voice trailed off as they came to the seats.Fal sat down; so did the boy.Fal was looking at him now but not listening.She was thinking."Perhaps they don't think you're mature enough yet. ""I am mature!""Hmm.They very rarely take people so young, you know.For all I know they're looking for a special sort of immaturity when they do take people your age. ""Well, that's silly.I mean, how do you know what to do if they don't tell you what they want?How can you prepare?I think it's all really unfair. ""In a way I think it's meant to be," Jase replied."They get so many people applying, they can't take them all or even just take the best because there are so many of them, so they choose at random from them.You can always reapply. ""I don't know," the boy said, sitting forward and putting his elbows on his knees and his head into his hands, staring at the polished wood of the deck."Sometimes I think they just tell you that so you won't feel bad when they reject you.I think they do maybe take the very best.But I think they've made a mistake.But because they won't tell you why you've failed, what can you do about it?"She was thinking about failure too.Jase had congratulated her on her idea about finding the Changer.Only that morning, when they were on the ancient steam funicular down from the lodge, they had heard about the events at Vavatch, when the Changer called Bora Horza Gobuchul had appeared and escaped on the pirate ship, taking their agent Perosteck Balveda with him.Her hunch had been right, and Jase was effusive in its praise, making the point that it wasn't her fault the man had got away.But she was depressed.Sometimes being right, thinking the correct thing, predicting accurately, depressed her.It had all seemed so obvious to her.It hadn't been a supernatural omen or anything silly like that when Perosteck Balveda suddenly turned up (on the battle damaged but victorious GCU Nervous Energy, which was towing most of a captured Idiran cruiser), but it had seemed so so natural that Balveda ought to be the one to go in search of the missing Changer.By that time they'd had more information about what had been going on in that volume of space when that particular duel had been going on; and the reported, possible and probable movements of various ships had pointed (again, she thought, fairly obviously) to the privateer craft called the Clear Air Turbulence.There were other possibilities, and they were followed up, too, as far as the already stretched resources of Contact's Special Circumstances section would allow, but she was always certain that if any of the branching possibilities was going to bear fruit it would be the Vavatch connection.The captain of the Clear Air Turbulence was called Kraiklyn; he played Damage.Vavatch was the most obvious site for a full Damage game in years.Therefore the most likely place to intercept the vessel  apart from Schar's World if the Changer already had control  was Vavatch.She had stuck her neck out by insisting that Vavatch was the most likely place, and that the woman agent Balveda should be one of those to go there, and now it had all come true and she realised it wasn't really her neck she had stuck out at all.It was Balveda's.But what else could be done?The war was accelerating throughout an immense volume; there were many other urgent missions for the few Special Circumstances agents, and anyway Balveda was the only really good one within range.There was one young man they'd sent in with her, but he was only promising, not experienced.Fal had known all along that if it came to it, Balveda would risk her own life, not the man's, if infiltrating the mercenaries was the only chance of getting to the Changer and through him to the Mind.It was brave but, Fal suspected, it was mistaken.The Changer knew Balveda; he might well recognise her, no matter how much she'd altered her own appearance (and there hadn't been time for Balveda to undergo radical physical change).If the Changer realised who she was (and Fal suspected he had), Balveda had far less chance of completing her mission than even the most callow and nervous but unsuspected rookie agent.Forgive me, lady, Fal thought to herself.I'd have done better by you if I could  She had tried to hate the Changer all that day, tried to imagine him and hate him because he had probably killed Balveda, but apart from the fact that she found it hard to imagine somebody when she had no idea what he might look like (the ship's captain, Kraiklyn?), for some reason the hatred would not materialise.The Changer did not seem real.She liked the sound of Balveda; she was brave and daring, and Fal hoped against hope that Balveda would live, that somehow she would survive it all and that one day, maybe, they would meet, perhaps after the war  But that didn't seem real, either.She couldn't believe in it; she couldn't imagine it the way she had imagined, say, Balveda finding the Changer.She had seen that in her mind, and had willed it to happen In her version, of course, it was Balveda who won, not the Changer.But she couldn't imagine meeting Balveda, and somehow that was frightening, as though she had started to believe in her own prescience so much that the inability to imagine something clearly enough meant that it would never happen.Either way, it was depressing.What chance had the agent of living through the war?Not a good one at the moment, Fal knew that, but even supposing Balveda did somehow save herself this time, what were the chances she'd wind up dead anyway, later on?The longer the war went on, the more likely it was.Fal felt, and the general concensus of opinion among the more clued up Minds was, that the war would last decades rather than years.Plus or minus a few months, of course.Fal frowned and bit her lip.She couldn't see them getting the Mind; the Changer was winning, and she had all but run out of ideas.All she had thought of recently was a way  perhaps, just maybe  of putting Gobuchul off: probably not a way of stopping him completely, but possibly a way of making his job harder.But she wasn't optimistic, even if Contact's War Command agreed to such a dangerous, equivocal and potentially expensive plan  "Fal?"Jase said.She realised she was looking at the island without seeing it.The glass was growing warm in her hand, and Jase and the boy were both looking at her."What?"she said, and drank."I was asking what you thought about the war," the boy said.He was frowning, looking at her with narrowed eyes, the sunlight sharp on his face.She looked at his broad, open face and wondered how old he was.Older than her?Younger?Did he feel like she did  wanting to be older, yearning to be treated as responsible?"I don't understand.What do you mean?Think about it in what way?""Well," the boy said, "who's going to win?"He looked annoyed.She suspected it had been very obvious that she hadn't been listening.She looked at Jase, but the old machine didn't say anything, and with no aura field there was no way of telling what it was thinking or how it was feeling.Was it amused?Worried?She drank, gulping down the last of the cool drink."We are, of course," she said quickly, glancing from the boy to Jase.The boy shook his head."I'm not so sure," he said, rubbing his chin."I'm not sure we have the will. ""The will?"Fal said."Yes.The desire to fight.I think the Idirans are natural fighters.We aren't.I mean, look at us" He smiled, as though he was much older and thought himself much wiser than she, and he turned his head and waved his hand lazily towards the island, where the boats lay tilted against the sand.Fifty or sixty metres away Fal saw what looked like a man and woman coupling, in the shallows under a small cliff; they were bobbing up and down, the woman's dark hands clasped round the man's lighter neck.Was that what the boy was being so urbane about?Good grief, the fascination of sex.No doubt it was great fun, but then how could people take it so seriously?Sometimes she felt a sneaking envy for the Idirans; they got over it; after a while it no longer mattered.They were dual hermaphrodites, each half of the couple impregnating the other, and each usually bearing twins.After one or occasionally two pregnancies  and weanings  they changed from their fertile breeder stage to become warriors.Opinion was divided on whether they increased in intelligence or just underwent a personality alteration.Certainly they became more cunning but less open minded, more logical but less imaginative, more ruthless, less compassionate.They grew by another metre; their weight almost doubled; their keratinous covering became thicker and harder; their muscles increased in bulk and density; and their internal organs altered to accommodate these power increasing changes.At the same time, their bodies absorbed their reproductive organs, and they became sexless.All very linear, symmetrical and tidy, compared to the Culture's pick your own approach.Yes, she could see why this gangly idiot sitting in front of her with his nervously superior smile would find the Idirans impressive.Young fool."This is " Fal was annoyed, enough to be a little stuck for words."This is just us now.We haven't evolved we've changed a lot, changed ourselves a lot, but we haven't evolved at all since we were running around killing ourselves.I mean each other. "She sucked her breath in, annoyed with herself now.The boy was smiling tolerantly at her.She felt herself blushing."We are still animals," she insisted."We're natural fighters just as much as the Idirans. ""Then how come they're winning?"the boy smirked."They had a head start.We didn't begin properly preparing for war until the last moment.Warfare has become a way of life for them; we're not all that good at it yet because it's been hundreds of generations since we had to do it.Don't worry," she told him, looking down at her empty glass and lowering her voice slightly, "we're learning quite fast enough. ""Well, you wait and see," the boy said, nodding at her."I think we'll pull out of the war and let the Idirans get on with their expansion  or whatever you want to call it.The war's been sort of exciting, and it's made a change, but it's been nearly four years now, and" He waved one hand again. "we haven't even won anything much yet. "He laughed."All we keep doing is running away!"Fal stood up quickly, turning away in case she started to cry."Oh shit," the boy was saying to Jase."I suppose I've gone and said something now Did she have a friend or a relation?"She walked down the deck, limping a little as the newly healed leg started to hurt again with a distant, nagging ache."Don't worry," Jase was saying to the boy."Leave her alone and she'll be all right"  She put her glass inside one of the dark, empty cabins of the yacht, then kept going, heading for the forward superstructure.She climbed up a ladder to the wheelhouse, then up another ladder to its roof, and sat there with her legs crossed (the recently broken leg hurt, but she ignored it) and looked out to sea.Far away, almost on the haze limit, a ridge of whiteness shimmered in the near still air.Fal "Ngeestra let out a long, sad breath and wondered if the white shapes  probably only visible because they were high up, in clearer air  were snowy mountain tops.Maybe they were just clouds.She couldn't remember the geography of the place well enough to work it out.She sat there, thinking of those peaks.She remembered when once, high in the foothills where a small mountain stream levelled out onto a marshy plateau for a kilometre or so, arcing and swerving and bowing over the sodden, reed covered land like an athlete stretching and flexing between games, she had found something which had made that winter day's walk memorable.Ice had been forming in clear, brittle sheets at the side of the flowing stream.She had spent some time happily marching through the shallows of the water, crunching the thin ice with her boots and watching it drift downstream.She wasn't climbing that day, just walking; she had waterproofs on and carried little gear.Somehow the fact she wasn't doing anything dangerous or physically demanding had made her feel like a young child again.She came to a place where the stream flowed over a terrace of rock, from one level of moor down to another, and there a small pool had carved itself into the rock just beneath the rapids.The water fell less than a metre, and the stream was narrow enough to jump: but she remembered that stream and that pool because there in the circling water, caught beneath the splashing rapids, floated a frozen circle of foam.The water was naturally soft and peaty, and a yellow white foam sometimes formed in the mountain streams of that area, blown by the winds and caught in the reeds, but she had never seen it collected into a circle like that and frozen.She laughed when she saw it.She waded in and carefully picked it up.It was only a little greater in diameter than the distance between her outstretched thumb and little finger and a few centimetres thick, not as fragile as she had at first feared.The frothy bubbles had frozen in the cold air and almost freezing water, making what looked like a tiny model of a galaxy: a fairly common spiral galaxy, like this one, like hers.She held the light confection of air and water and suspended chemicals and turned it over in her hands, sniffing it, sticking her tongue out and licking it, looking at the dim winter sun through it, flicking her finger to see if it would ring.She watched her little rime galaxy start to melt, very slowly, and saw her own breath blow across it, a brief image of her warmth in the air.Finally she put it back where she had found it, slowly revolving in the pool of water at the base of the small rapids.The galaxy image had occurred to her then, and she thought at the time about the similarity of the forces which shaped both the little and the vast.She had thought, And which is really the most important?but then felt embarrassed to have thought such a thing.Every now and again, though, she went back to that thought, and knew that each was exactly as important as the other.Then later she would go back to her second thoughts on the matter and feel embarrassed again.Fal "Ngeestra took a deep breath and felt a little better.She smiled and raised her head, closing her eyes for a moment and watching the red sun haze behind her eyelids.Then she ran a hand through her curly blonde hair and wondered again if the distant, wavering, unsure shapes over the shimmering water were clouds, or mountains.9.Schar's World  Imagine a vast and glittering ocean seen from a great height.It stretches to the clear curved limit of every angle of horizon, the sun burning on a billion tiny wavelets.Now imagine a smooth blanket of cloud above the ocean, a shell of black velvet suspended high above the water and also extending to the horizon, but keep the sparkle of the sea despite the lack of sun.Add to the cloud many sharp and tiny lights, scattered on the base of the inky overcast like glinting eyes: singly, in pairs, or in larger groups, each positioned far, far away from any other set.That is the view a ship has in hyperspace as it flies like a microscopic insect, free between the energy grid and real space.The small, sharp lights on the undersurface of the cloud cover are stars; the waves on the sea are the irregularities of the Grid on which a ship travelling in hyperspace finds traction with its engine fields, while that sparkle is its source of energy.The Grid and the plain of real space are curved, rather like the ocean and the cloud would be round a planet, but less so.Black holes show as thin and twisting waterspouts from clouds to sea; supernovae as long lightning flashes in the overcast.Rocks, moons, planets, Orbitals, even Rings and Spheres, hardly show at all  The two Killer class Rapid Offensive Units Trade Surplus and Revisionist raced through the hyperspace, flashing underneath the web of real space like slim and glittering fish in a deep, still pond.They wove past systems and stars, keeping deep beneath the empty spaces where they were least likely to be traced.Their engines were each a focus of energy almost beyond imagining, packing sufficient power within their two hundred metres to equal perhaps one per cent of the energy produced by a small sun, flinging the two vessels across the four dimensional void at an equivalent speed in real space of rather less than ten light years per hour.At the time, this was considered particularly fast.They sensed the Glittercliff and Sullen Gulf ahead.They twisted their headlong rush to angle them deep inside the war zone, aiming themselves at the system which contained Schar's World.Far in the distance, they could see the group of black holes which had created the Gulf.Those flutes of plunging energy had passed through the area millennia before, clearing a space of consumed stars behind them, creating an artificial galactic arm as they headed in a long spiral closer towards the centre of the slowly spinning island of stars and nebulae that was the galaxy.The group of black holes was commonly known as the Forest, so closely were they grouped, and the two speeding Culture craft had instructions to try to force their way between those twisted, lethal trunks, if they were seen and pursued.The Culture's field management was considered superior to the Idirans', so it was thought they would have a better chance of getting through, and any chasing craft might even break off rather than risk tangling with the Forest.It was a terrible risk even to contemplate, but the two ROUs were precious; the Culture had not yet built many, and everything possible had to be done to make sure that the craft got back safely or, if the worst came to the worst, were destroyed utterly.They encountered no hostile ships.They flashed across the inward face of the Quiet Barrier in seconds and delivered their prescribed loads in two short bursts, then twisted once and tore away at maximum speed, out through the thinning stars and past the Glitter cliff, into the empty skies of the Sullen Gulf.They registered hostile craft stationed near the Schar's World system starting off in pursuit, but they had been seen too late, and they quickly outdistanced the probing beams of track lasers.They set course for the far side of the Gulf, their strange mission completed.The Minds on board, and the small crew of humans each vessel carried (who were there more because they wanted to be than for their utility), hadn't been told why they were blasting empty space with expensive warheads, shooting off CREWSs at each other's target drones, dumping clouds of CAM and ordinary gas and releasing odd little unpowered signalling ships which were little more than unmanned shuttles packed with broadcasting equipment.The entire effect of this operation would be to produce a few spectacular flashes and flares and a scattering of radiation shells and wide band signals before the Idirans cleared up the debris and blasted or captured the signal craft.They had been asked to risk their lives on some damn fool panic mission which seemed designed to convince nobody in particular that there had been a space battle in the middle of nowhere when there hadn't.And they had done it!What was the Culture coming to?The Idirans seemed to relish suicide missions.You could easily form the impression that they considered being asked to carry out any other sort something of an insult.But the Culture?Where even in the war forces discipline was regarded as a taboo word, where people always wanted to know why this and why that?Things had come to a pretty pass indeed.The two ships raced across the Gulf, arguing.On board, heated discussions were taking place between members of their crews.It took twenty one days for the Clear Air Turbulence to make the journey from Vavatch to Schar's World.Wubslin had spent the time carrying out what repairs he could to the craft, but what the ship needed was another thorough overhaul.While structurally it was still sound, and life support functioned nearly normally, it had suffered a general degradation of its systems, though no catastrophic failures.The warp units ran a little more raggedly than before, the fusion motors were not up to sustained use in an atmosphere  they would get them down to and up from Schar's World, but not provide much more in airflying time  and the vessel's sensors had been reduced in numbers and efficiency to a level not far above operational minimum.They had still escaped lightly, Horza thought.With the CAT under his control, Horza was able to switch off the computer's identity circuits.He didn't have to fool the Free Company, either; so, as the days passed, he Changed slowly to resemble his old self a little more.That was for Yalson and the other members of the Free Company.He was really striking two thirds of a compromise between Kraiklyn and the self he had been on the CAT before it had reached Vavatch.There was another third in there which he let grow and show itself on his face for nobody on board, but for a red haired Changer girl called Kierachell.He hoped she would recognise that part of his appearance when they met again, on Schar's World."Why did you think we'd be angry?"Yalson asked him in the CAT's hangar one day.They had set up a target screen at one end and put their lasers onto practice.The screen's built in projector flashed images for them to shoot at.Horza looked at the woman."He was your leader. "Yalson laughed."He was a manager; how many of them are liked by their staff?This is a business, Horza, and not even a successful one.Kraiklyn managed to get most of us retired prematurely.Shit!The only person you needed to fool was the ship. ""There was that," Horza said, aiming at a human figure darting across the distant screen.The laser spot was invisible, but the screen sensed it and flashed white light where it hit.The human figure, hit in the leg, stumbled but did not fall: half marks."I did need to fool the ship.But I didn't want to risk somebody being loyal to Kraiklyn. "It was Yalson's turn, but she was looking at Horza, not the screen.The ship's fidelities had been bypassed, and now all that was needed to command it was a numeric code, which only Horza knew, and the small ring he wore, which had been Kraiklyn's.He had promised that when they got to Schar's World, if there was no other way off the planet, he would set the CAT's computer to free itself of all fidelity limitations after a given time, so that if he didn't come back out of the tunnels of the Command System the Free Company would not be stranded.
