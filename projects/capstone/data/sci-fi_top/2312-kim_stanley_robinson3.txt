Private jet.Well have to get a worm box too.A what?We have a system.Its always supposed to be a box of soil or worms, and theres an understanding that it doesnt get inspected.Worms?Kiran said.Thats right, Zasha told him with a grim little smile.Im going to get you off planet, because of Ms.Stockholm here, but given the circumstances, we have to do it off the record.That takes using the systems we have.So you might have to go up in a big box of worms, all right?Are you going to be okay with that?No problem, said Kiran.Extracts (4)  At the end of the period of planetary accretion, about 4.5 billion years ago, there were more planets than there are now, all slung around by close calls and orbital resonances and pulled together by gravity, so that they sometimes collided.They had been doing it for a billion years to get to this point, and this was the last stage of that process of accretion.During this period every one of the inner planets took at least one very big hit.A planet called Theia grew at Earths L5 point until it was about the size of Mars, then drifted into a collision with Earth.It hit at a forty five degree angle, at something less than four kilometers per secondnot fast in astronomical terms.Theias iron core plunged in and merged with Earths core, and Theias mantle and some of Earths mantle were thrown into orbit.The angular momentum imparted by the hit spun Earth to a five hour day.Two moons accreted from the ejected material rather quickly; estimates range from a month to a century.Eventually the smaller moon splatted onto the larger one, leaving behind the jagged mountains on the anti terran side of the resulting moon, Luna.Around the same time, a small planet about three thousand kilometers in diameter struck Mars and created the Borealis Basin, which is basically Marss northern hemisphere, still six kilometers lower than the southern hemisphere.Venus was struck by a Mars sized planet, creating a moon like Earths, called Neith; ten million years later, another impactor gave Venus its slow retrograde motion.This change in rotation slowed Neith and caused it to plunge back into Venus and merge with it.Mercury was struck by a protoplanet half its size, at such a speed and angle that Mercurys mantle was stripped off and cast throughout Mercurys orbit.Ordinarily Mercury would have swept these pieces back up, but in the four million years this process would have taken, most of the material was pushed outward by solar radiation and thus never made it back to Mercury.About sixteen quadrillion tons of Mercurys crust eventually ended up on Earth, and more on Venus.In the end only the heaviest 70 percent of Mercury remained, essentially the planets core.Thus the Mars g for a diameter smaller than Titans.Somewhat later, the young Jupiter and Saturn fell into a one to two orbital resonance, with Jupiter spinning through two of its years for every one of Saturns.This created a very powerful combined gravity wave, swinging around the solar system at varying strength, depending on where the two giants were in relation to each other.This new wave at its strongest caught Neptune, which had grown just outside Saturn, and threw it away from the sun!Neptune flew out past Uranus, pulling Uranus outward too, also onto its side.Only at that point did the two smaller gas giants end up in the orbits they now occupy.Inside Jupiters orbit, meanwhile, that same Jupiter Saturn resonance wave caught asteroids and threw them like pinballs all over the system, in the period called the Late Heavy Bombardment, 3.9 billion years ago.All the inner planets and moons were pummeled with impacts, to the point where the surfaces of these planets often were seas of molten rock.The Era of Big Hits!The Late Heavy Bombardment!Never let it be said that the great merry go round is entirely fixed and regular in its motionthat it doesnt sometimes resemble more a swirl of bumper cars.Gravity, mysterious gravity, immutably following its own laws, interacts with matter, and somehow the result is complex motion.Invisible waves slinging rocks this way and that.What if human history has such invisible waves?Because ultimately the same forces apply.What big hits made us what we are?Will some new resonance create a wave and throw us in a new direction?Are we entering our own Late Heavy Bombardment?KIRAN AND SWAN  From the moment Kiran saw the woman his cousins had grabbed, everything changed.She was old, tall, good looking.She moved as if she were swimming.He knew immediately that she was a spacer, and that kidnapping her was a terrible idea.After that everything went a bit too fast for him actually to be deciding what to do.This is what happened to him when he was in a pinch: he watched himself do what he did from just behind and to one side.People said he was cool, but really he was slow.And yet good things still seemed to happen.Her hair was black; she looked Chinese or Mongol.Her eyes were brown, with a little blue patch at the bottom of one eye; and really it was her eyes that captured him.Some kind of coincidencethe girls back home had those same dark eyes with luminous whites, in a dark faceit was very compelling to him.She had looked to him the moment he had taken her arm, to show how much she wanted to be freea very passionate look, as if she knew what being held captive was like, and was afraid.It shocked him how expressive her face was, how firmly she grabbed his attention.Her friend Zasha had called it Lima syndromemaybe so.Maybe now he was an incompetent Peruvian.But he was going to space.That meant leavingbut he could send money back to his relatives.They were tired of putting him up anyway.He could go and see what he had always dreamed of seeingwhich was really just anywhere, but space in particular, ever since he was a small boy.Mars, the asteroidsanywhere out there.Everyone heard stories.The woman drove them out to Newark.Jammed in the little seat behind them, he began to realize it was really happeningsomething, anyway.His idiot cousins were not going to be able to find him and beat him.A new life: he began to quiver slightly, as if he were the hostage who had been kidnapped.In a way it was almost true.Captured by a look, stuffed into the backseat of a car.They came to an airport that did not look like Newark.They drove out to a hangar and were escorted up a stand of stairs into a small jet.He had never been in anything like it, and was impressed by its speed as they took off.They gave him a window seat and he watched Manhattan below, like a great ship of light.Off they went into the night.Eventually he leaned his head on the window and fell asleep.Later he woke with a stiff neck, watched the ocean get closer.The jet landed on a green island with reddish soil.Out into a pungent evening, humid air like mid August in Jersey, almost like his childhood home in Hyderabad.Rice fields.Childhood memories sparked out of what he saw and smelled, and again he walked as if a little beside himself.He was very distracted as they entered a building.Mercury House, a sign said.Inside, they took him to a big room, where immense white plastic tubs like those used in industrial kitchens were being sealed and loaded onto a pallet.All right, young man, said Swans friend Zasha, clearly still a little disgusted to have to be doing this for Swan.In you go.Put on this spacesuit first, then the helmet.After that were going to cover you in dirt and worms, and up you go.To Swan: My friend wont inspect the boxes that have my sign on them.Hes got the next shift.Why the worms?Its a way to show Im not using it casually.I only send up a couple people a year like this.And naturally he gets favors back from me.What about the AI inspections?What about them?We do a lot of stuff outside that system.Zasha grinned fiercely at her.This is a hawala elevator, the whole thing is set up to skip certain scans.Then Kiran was in a crinkly one piece and had a helmet on and was breathing cool coppery air.They helped him in and laid him out in the tub as if in his coffin, and a wriggling mass of worms and black dirt was dumped over his body and face.He was going to leave Earth buried in worms.Thank you!he called out to the woman and her friend.It was a long trip.Kiran lay there thinking.He could feel the worms writhing all over him.When he freaked out and hyperventilated, the helmet and suit seemed to be able to take it.Eventually he always had to calm back down.There were water and food tubes that would come out of the neck of the suit to where he could suck on them, and though the food was a paste, it was very sustaining.He was not too cold or too hot.The sensation of movement over him was disconcerting, sometimes horrible.This must be what it was like to be dead and buried.The worms would eat you.Or it was like the purification rites in certain festivalsin the Durga puja, for instance, in which you were steeped in ash or manure until it was time for the cleansing.He liked that holiday.So here he was.As he had to eat and drink, then shit and pee, all in this suit, he was for the moment pretty much like the worms.We are poor forked worms on this Earth, his grandfather used to say.Birds pick us off.As time passed he went entirely weightless.He had heard it took five days to ascend.It seemed longer.He began to get bored.When he felt a jolt upward, and then light flooded the dirt and the lid disappeared, he struggled up as carefully as he could, thinking the worms in the box were fellow travelers who deserved no harm.Careful!he commanded the people helping him out of the box, and Swan laughed at him.She led him to a little bathroom.Once out of his suit, he showered.In the hot water he thought, Ah yes, this is the cleansing.Next came the purification; what would it be?Was this woman who had seized him a manifestation of Durga, mother of Ganeshalso sometimes manifested as Kali?You look good, Swan said when he emerged from the bathroom.Not too traumatic?Kiran shook his head.Time to think.Where to next?Again she laughed.This ship is going to Venus, she told him.Im on my way to Mercury, so Ill drop you off.Kiran said, Isnt Venus a Chinese place?Yes and no, Swan said.Kiran persisted: So I become Chinese?No.There are all kinds of people there.My friends will give you an ID.After that, anything can happen.But Venus is a good place for you to start.They were traveling in a terrarium called the Delta of Venus, an ag asteroid dedicated to growing food for Earthmostly enhanced rices but also other crops that liked it warm and wet.The internal gravity felt like Earth; Kiran couldnt detect the famous Coriolis push to the side.They spent their days out in the upcurving fields, working alongside water buffalo, tractors, canal boats, and many other workers, most of them passengers.After an hour the work became hard on the back, and as the passengerssome of them only a little taller than the rice sprouts, while others were taller than giants, which was at first startling to seesloshed up and down the rows, they talked to pass the time.Complaint and desire to be elsewhere were natural themes.Im festivalled out.Ive tried them all.The only place terraforming matters is on Earth, and theyre terrible at it.Its all turning out to be face business.We could have taken the Grindewald and gone mountain climbing.The Mnch, the Eiger, the Jungfrau, theyve reproduced every damn crack.Id rather go in an aquarium and swim around.Live with a mermaid for a week.Beachworlds were wonderful, all agreed.With Earths beaches gone, the ones inside aquaria were much beloved.Others advocated cloud forest worlds; these were visits to arboreal heaven and an earlier stage of primate life.Such bliss to be a monkey!Someone said, Or a bonobo.I wish I had gone on a sexliner.This broke a little dam of reticence and brought the talk immediately around to sex on those sexliners, which were often designed to look like Caribbean resorts.Dionysian dances, perpetual tantric orgies, Kundalini panmixia, everyone had a story.One of them said mournfully, I could have spent the whole trip in a touchy feely box, and here I am wielding a hand hoe.Touchy feely box?Kiran couldnt help asking.You get in a box that has holes cut in it about as big around as your hand, and then people reach in the holes and do what they want.Im surprised people would do that.Lines always seem pretty long, for both inside and outside.I should have thought of the worms that way, Kiran said to Swan.Could have been happy all the way up that elevator.Id rather be in here than in one of those, someone else called.Farms are sexy!All this fertilizer!Many groaned at this.It was not a joke that resonated.Someone else said, Last time I was on a sexliner, this group of bisexuals ran out to the pool, about twenty of them, all with the biggest tits and cocks you ever saw, and all of them with erections, and they got in a circle one behind the next and plunged into the one in front of them and away they went.It was like when you see insects clumping together on a summer day, keep fucking till they fall to the ground.This brought on quite a silence until someone said heavily, Wish I had seen that, which got the others laughing, or loudly protesting that any such image had ever been put in their heads.Im just saying, the witness insisted.These things happen.Its a regular sport.And it seemed to Kiran that after the talk about sexliners the rice planting hurt less.And when these people were done for the day and back at the dorm, it seemed like the farm might turn into a sexy place after all.There was a look in peoples eyes Kiran thought he recognized.Extracts (5)  Take raw Venus.CO2 atmosphere of ninety five bar, temperature at surface would melt lead, hotter even than Mercurys brightside.A hellish place.On the other hand, .9 g, and just a tad smaller than Earth.Two continental rises on the surface, Ishtar and Aphrodite.Earths sister planet.Theres real potential here for a great new creation.Take one Saturnian ice moonDione will do fine.Dismantle with Von Neumann self replicating excavators, cutting it into chunks about ten kilometers on a side.Attach mass drivers to the chunks and send them down to Venus.While doing this, build a round sunshield of lunatic aluminum, very thin material, only 50 grams per square meter and yet still totaling 3 x 1013 kilograms, the largest thing ever built by humans.Concentric strips give the sunshield flexibility and allow it to tack up into the solar wind to hold its position at the L1 point, where it will shadow Venus entirely.Deprived of insolation, the planet will cool at a rate of five K a year.After 140 years, the CO2 atmosphere will have rained and snowed to the surface and frozen as a layer of dry ice.Scrape all the dry ice that landed on Ishtar and Aphrodite down to the lowlands, being careful to keep a smooth surface.While clearing off the continents, release another suite of Von Neumann self replicating chemical factories designed to break oxygen out of the frozen CO2; these will create 150 millibars of oxygen for the atmosphere, in about the same time it takes for all the CO2 atmosphere to freeze.A purely oxygen atmosphere would be too flammable, so add a buffer gas, preferably nitrogen, to make a more stable mix.Titan may be oversubscribed for its excess nitrogen, so be prepared to seek substitutions.Argon mined on Luna would also serve in a pinch.When you have the oxygen you want, and the dry ice all flat on the lowlands, cover the dry ice with foamed rock, so that the CO2 is a completely sequestered feature of the lithosphere.Now take the chunks of Dione you have been saving and crack them against each other in the oxygen and buffer atmosphere at the correct height to create steam and rain.This will add back to the planet some heat, which at this point has been taken below the human friendly range.Possibly some light can be let through the sunshield if needed to help heating.It will only take two years for the greater part of the impact water to rain and snow onto the surface, so be ready to work fast.The water on the surface after this Dione infusion will be equal to about 10 percent of Earths water.It will be freshwater; salt to taste.The water will cover 80 percent of Venus, which is much flatter than Earth, to an average depth of 120 meters.If deeper seas are preferred, but also a maximum amount of land, consider digging an oceanic trench with some of the Dione impactors.Remember this will complicate the CO2 sequestration if you choose to do it, so make adjustments accordingly.If it is done carefully, however, Venus could ultimately end up with about twice the land surface that Earth has.At this point (140 years freezing and preparation, 50 years scraping and poaching, so be patient!)you might think that the planet is ready for biological occupation.But remember, combining the Venusian year of 224 days with its daily rotation period of 243 days, you get a screwball curve (retrograde motion, sun rising in the west) in which the solar day for any particular point on the planet is 116.75 days.Tests have long since determined that thats too long for most Terran life forms to survive, tweaked or not.So at this point, two main options have been identified.First is to program the sunshield so that it lets through sunlight to the surface and then blocks it off again, flexing like a circular venetian blind to make a more Terran rhythm of night and day.This would make it easy on the new biosphere, but would require that the sunshield work without fail.The second option would call for another round of impactor bombardments, this time striking the surface of the planet such that their angular momentum spins the planet up to something like a fifty hour day, which is considered within the tolerance limit for most Terran life forms.The problem with this option is the way it would delay occupation of the planets surface, by its release of a considerable amount of the sequestered dry ice under the foamed rock layer.Biosphere establishment would have to be put off for another two hundred years, effectively doubling the time of terraformation.But there would be no further reliance on a sunshield.And a properly constituted and maintained Venusian atmosphere could handle full sunlight without greenhousing or other spoilage.Which option you choose is your preference.Think about what you want in the end, or, if you dont believe in endings, which process you prefer.KIRAN AND SHUKRA  A few days later they were approaching Venus.Kiran was pleased to see Swan joining him on the ferry ride down.She wanted to talk to a friend; she would introduce Kiran to him, then be on her way.There were no space elevators on Venus, because the planet rotated too slowly for such a system to work.So their ferry sprouted wings, and as they tore down through the atmosphere the windows torched yellow white.They landed on a huge runway next to a domed city, then got into a subway car, and came up from that short ride into the city.There they found what seemed like the entire population in the streets.Kiran followed Swan through the crowds, and in a side street they went up some stairs into a little Mercury House, set over a fish shop.They dropped off their bags, then went back out to join the crowd.The faces of the city were mostly Asian.People shouted, and in the din no one could hear well, so they shouted even louder.Swan looked at Kiran and grinned at his expression.It isnt always like this!she shouted.Too bad!Kiran shouted back.Two big ice asteroids were apparently headed for a collision at the upper edge of the new Venusian atmosphere, roughly above the equator.This city, Colette, was three hundred kilometers north of the collision, and would therefore be quickly enveloped in a downpour.The rain would not stop for a couple of years, Swan said, after which they would let a little light through their sunscreen and have more ordinary weather.But first the big rain.Crowds stood around them waiting for it, singing and cheering and shouting.And right at midnight the southern sky lit up white, then incandescent yellow, then all the reds ever seen.The inside of the city looked briefly like they were seeing it in the infrared.The noise of the cheering was stupendous.Somewhere a brass band was playingKiran spotted the musicians, on risers across the squareseveral hundred trumpets, French horns, baritones, trombones, tubas, all the euphoniums, everything from miniature cornets to alphorns, playing immense dissonant chords that blatted in the air and shifted ceaselessly toward harmonies that never came.Kiran didnt know whether to call it music; it sounded like they played without a plan.The effect was to make people shout and howl, leap and dance.They were making their sky.Within the hour a wild rain had erased the stars and was drumming onto the dome as if trying to wash it away.They might as well have been at the bottom of a waterfall.The citys lights bounced off the dome glass and came back somehow liquefied, so that shadows ran over peoples faces.At some point Swan squeezed Kirans upper arm in a manner very like the way he had hers the night they had met.He felt the pressure, he knew what she meant; his blood burned up and down from the spot she held.All right already!he shouted to her.Thank you!With a little smile she let him go.They stood in the streaming light, the dome a dim milky white over them.The roar of voices was like waves breaking on a beach of cobbles.Youll be all right?she said.Ill be fine!So now you owe me.Yes.But I dont know what I can give you in return.Ill think of something, she said.For now, Ill introduce you to Shukra.I worked for him a long time ago, and now hes moved into some very high circles here.So if you work for him and do your best, and he likes you, then youll have your chance.Ill give you a translator to help you.Back in Colettes Mercury House they ate a breakfast, then Swan took Kiran across town to meet her friend Shukra.He proved to be a middle aged man with a round cheerful face under a shock of white hair.Sorry about Alex, he said to Swan.I enjoyed working with her.Yes, Swan said.Seems like everyone did.She introduced Kiran: I met this young man when I went out to Jersey, and he got me out of a mess.He wanted a job, and I thought he might be someone you could use.Shukra heard this impassively, but Kiran could see from the bunching of his eyebrows that he was interested.What can you do?he said to Kiran.Construction, retail, janitorial, bookkeeping, Kiran said.And I can learn fast.Youll need to, Shukra said.Ive got jobs that need doing, so well get you into something.Oh, Swan said, and he needs papers.Ah, Shukra said.Swan met his gaze without flinching.Now she was going to owe him, Kiran saw.If you say so, he said at last.You are my black swan.Ill see what I can do.Thanks, Swan said.After that she needed to get out to the spaceport to catch her flight.She took Kiran aside and briefly hugged him.Ill see you again.I hope so!Kiran said.It will happen.I get around.She smiled briefly.Anyway, well always have New Jersey.Lima, he said.Well always have Lima.She laughed.I thought it was Stockholm.And gave him a kiss on the cheek and was gone.Extracts (6)  The economic model of the space settlements developed in part from their origins as scientific stations.In this early model, life in space was not a market economy; once you were in space, your housing and food were provided in an allotment system, as in Antarctic scientific stations.What markets existed tended to be private unregulated individual enterprises in nonessential goods.Capitalism was in effect relegated to the margin, and the necessities of life were a shared commons  exchange between Earth and individual space colonies was on a national or treaty association basis, thus a kind of colonial model, with the colonies producing metals and volatiles, knowledge useful for Earth management, and later on, food  once the space elevators were in place (first at Quito, 2076) traffic between Earth and space increased by a factor of a hundred million.At that point the solar system became accessible.It was too big to inhabit rapidly, but the increasing speed of space travel meant that over the course of the twenty second century the entire solar system came within easy reach.It is not a coincidence that the second half of this century saw the beginning of the Accelerando  the space diaspora occurred as late capitalism writhed in its internal decision concerning whether to destroy Earths biosphere or change its rules.Many argued for the destruction of the biosphere, as being the lesser of two evils  one of the most influential forms of economic change had ancient origins in Mondragon, Euskadi, a small Basque town that ran an economic system of nested co ops organized for mutual support.A growing network of space settlements used Mondragon as a model for adapting beyond their scientific station origins to a larger economic system.Cooperating as if in a diffuse Mondragon, the individual space settlements, widely scattered, associated for mutual support and  supercomputers and artificial intelligence made it possible to fully coordinate a non market economy, in effect mathematicizing the Mondragon.Needs were determined year to year in precise demographic detail, and production then directed to fill the predicted needs.All economic transactionsfrom energy creation and extraction of raw materials, through manufacturing and distribution, to consumption and waste recyclingwere accounted for in a single computer program.Once policy questions were answeredmeaning desires articulated in a sharply contested political strugglethe total annual economy of the solar system could be called out on a quantum computer in less than a second.The resulting qube programmed Mondragon, sometimes called the Albert Hahnel model, or the Spuffordized Soviet cybernetic model, could be  if everyone had been working in a programmed Mondragon, all would have been well; but it was only one of several competing economies on Earth, all decisively under the thumb of late capitalism, still in control of more than half of Earths capital and production, and with its every transaction tenaciously reaffirming ownership and capital accumulation.This concentration of power had not gone away but only liquefied for a while and then jelled elsewhere, much of it on Mars, as Gini figures for the era clearly reveal  in residual emergent models, any given economic system or historical moment is an unstable mix of past and future systems.Capitalism therefore was the combination or battleground of its residual element, feudalism, and its emergent elementwhat?with the success of the Martian revolution and the emergence of its single planetwide social democratic system, the gates were opened for the rest of the solar system to follow.Many space settlements remained colonies of Terran nations and combines, however, so the ultimate result was a patchwork of systems somewhat resembling anarchy.Much of the space economy came to be dominated by a league of settlements called the Mondragon Accord.The Accord was renewed at a conference every five years, and annually the Accords AIs called out its economy, thereafter correcting it frequently (several times a second)  the longer the Mondragon Accord went on, the more robust it got.Confident in the Accords support of the necessities, individual settlements enterprise markets made more and more side deals, the so called above and beyonds, all working on the margin.If not for Mars and its  as feudalism is the residual on Earth, capitalism is the residual on Mars  the margin itself grows with prosperity, resulting in increasing sophistication and culture  the existence of the marginal economy, semiautonomous, semi unregulated, resembling anarchy, filled with fraud, double dealing, and crime, delighted all free marketeers, libertarians, anarchists, and many others, some enjoying the bonobo barter and others the machismo of a wild west and wealth beyond need  marginal capitalism is a tough guy sport like rugby or tackle football, suitable mostly for people slightly overdosed on testosterone.On the other hand, with some rule and attitude changes, it has proven it can be an interesting game, even beautiful, like baseball or volleyball.It is a valid project at the margin, a form of self actualization, not to be applied to the necessities, but on the margin a nice hobby, even perhaps an art form  confining capitalism to the margin was the great Martian achievement, like defeating the mob or any other protection racket      WAHRAM AND SWAN  Wahram was back in Terminator before Swan returned from Earth.At that point the city was sliding over the immense plain of Beethoven Crater, and Wahram screwed his courage to the sticking point and when she got into town, asked Swan if she wanted to go out with him to a facility in the west wall of Beethoven, to hear a concert and catch up on things.As he made the call, he was, he had to admit, nervous.Her quicksilver manner left him uncertain what to expect; he could not even predict whether he would be going out to Beethoven with her or with Pauline.On the other hand, he liked Pauline; so hopefully it would be all right either way.And with luck Swan would no longer be so intent to learn all there was to know about Alexs plans concerning the qubes.That, Inspector Genette had made very clear, they had to keep from her.In any case, the chance to hear some Beethoven was enough to spur him on.He made the call; and Swan agreed to go.After that Wahram looked up the program for the performance they were to attend, and was excited to see it was a triple bill of rarely played transcriptions: first a wind ensemble playing a transcription of the Appassionata piano sonata; then Beethovens opus 134, which was his own transcription for two pianos of his Grosse Fugue for string quartet, opus 133.Lastly a string quartet was to play a transcription of their own for the Hammerklavier sonata.Brilliant programming, Wahram felt, and he joined Swan at the south lock of Terminator with an anticipation so strong that it overwhelmed the uneasiness he felt both about her and about being outside Terminator, on the surface of Mercury.Necessary movement westwardwell, this was always true in some sense, he told himself, and focused his thoughts on the concert.Maybe there was no real reason for concern.It was interesting to think that he might be irrationally afraid of the sun.At the little museum in the west wall of Beethoven, he was astonished to see that they were almost the only people in the audience, aside from the musicians not playing, who sat in the front rows to listen.The facility had an empty main room that would have held a few thousand people, but happily this concert was in a side hall with just a couple hundred seats, arced around a small stage in Greek theater style.Acoustics were excellent.The wind ensemble, slightly outnumbering its audience, rollicked its way through the finale of the Appassionata in a way that made it one of the greatest wind pieces Wahram had ever heard, fast to the point of effervescence.The transcription to winds made it a new thing in the same way that Ravel had made Mussorgskys Pictures at an Exhibition a new thing.When they were done, two pianists got up, and sitting at grand pianos snuggled into each other like two sleeping cats, they played Beethovens own opus 134, his transcription of his Grosse Fugue.They had to pound away like percussionists, simply hammering the keys.More clearly than ever Wahram heard the intricate weave of the big fugue, also the crazy energy of the thing, the maniacal vision of a crushing clockwork.The sharp attack of struck piano keys gave the piece a clarity and violence that strings with the best will and technique in the world could not achieve.Wonderful.Then some other transcriber had gone in the opposition direction, arranging the Hammerklavier sonata for string quartet.Here, even though four instruments were now playing a piece written for one, it was still a challenge to convey the Hammerklaviers intensity.Broken out among two violins, viola, and cello, it all unpacked beautifully: the magnificent anger of the first movement; the aching beauty of the slow movement, one of Beethovens finest; and then the finale, another big fugue.It all sounded very like the late quartets to Wahrams earthus a new late quartet, by God!It was tremendous to hear.Wahram glanced around at the audience and saw the wind players and the pianists were standing on their feet behind the chairs, bouncing, swaying in place, faces uplifted and eyes closed, as if in prayer; hands sometimes spastically waving before them, as if conducting or dancing.Swan too was back there dancing, looking transported.Wahram was very pleased to see that; he was out there himself in the space of Beethoven, a very great space indeed.It would have been shocking to see someone immune to it; it would have put her outside his zone of sympathy or comprehension.Afterward, as an encore, the musicians announced they wanted to try an experiment.They separated the two pianos, and the string quartet then sat between them, in a circle facing inward; then they reprised the two big fugues, all playing at the same time.The two pieces overlapped with the wrong instruments applied to each, increasing the cognitive confusion; and the quiet parts in each came at the same time, in an urgent eye of the storm, revealing the structural similarity of the two monsters.When both returned to their main fugues, the six instruments sawed or pounded away in their own worlds, lashing out six different tunes in a crisscross fury, with Messiaenic crashes.They ended together somehow.Wahram wasnt certain which of them had been extended or curtailed to make that happen, but in any case they finished together with a big crash, and everyone there, already on their feet, could only clap and cheer and whistle.Wonderful, Wahram said afterward.Truly.Swan shook her head.Too crazy at the end, but I liked it.They stayed around to join the congratulations and the discussion among the musicians, who were as interested as could be in what it had sounded like from the outside; more than one said they had been able to focus only on their own parts.Someone played back a recording made of it, and they listened along with the rest, until the musicians began to pause the recording and discuss details.Time to get back to Terminator, Swan said.All right.Thanks ever so much for this, it was very fine.My pleasure.Listen, do you want to walk back over to the city tracks?Its nice after a wild concert like this one.Theyve got suits here we can use.It gives you a chance to walk it out a little.Butdo we have time?Oh yes.Well get to the platform well ahead of the city.Ive done this before.She must not have noticed his discomfort at being out on the surface of Mercury.Well, so he had to agree.Even though every other member of the audience, and the musicians too, took the tram back.On which they were almost certainly continuing the interesting discussion of the concert, of transpositions in Beethoven, and so on.But no.A walk on a burned world.When their borrowed spacesuits had confirmed integrity, they exited the halls air lock and headed back north toward Terminators tracks.Beethoven Crater had as smooth a surface as he had seen on Mercury.Little Bello was under the horizon to the east.Wahram walked along nervously.Their headlamps illuminated long ellipses of black desert.Fines lofted from the fronts of their boots and drifted back to the baked ground behind them.Their boot prints would last for a billion years, but they were on a track of prints, and the damage to the surface had long since been done.Flanking the dusty trail, the knobby granulated rock caught their headlamps beams and reflected them in little diamond pricks of light that looked like frost, though they must have been minute crystal surfaces.They passed a rock with a Kokopelli painted on it; the figure appeared to be holding a telescope rather than a flute and was pointing the glass to the east.For a while Wahram whistled the theme of the Grosse Fugue, half speed, under his breath.Do you whistle?Swan asked, sounding surprised.I suppose I do.So do I!Wahram, who did not think of himself as someone who whistled for others, did not continue.They topped a small rise, and before them lay Terminators tracks.No city in sight yet; one had to assume it was still over the horizon to the east.The nearest track blocked the view of most of those paralleling it on its other side.It was made of a particular kind of tempered steel, he had heard, and gleamed a dull silver in the starlight.Its underside stood a few meters above the ground, and the thick pylons supporting it were set every fifty meters or so.A loading platform abutted the outer track to the northwest of them, he was happy to see.The tram from the concert was already there.Sunlight pricked a high point on the west wall of Beethoven.Everything in the landscape was lit by that burnished cliff edge.Dawn was on its way, slow but sure.When it came over the eastern horizon Terminator would make a grand sight.Possibly that was the dome of the globe, already visible as a curved glint.A stupendous flash of light blazed up from the tracks where the loading platform had been.A bloodred afterimage split his vision in two halves; as it was pulsing back to a less vivid vertical blob, rocks began crashing down around them, kicking up puffs of dust that moved like splashed water.They both cried out, although Wahram had no idea what either said; then Swan was crying, Get down, guard your head!and tugging at his arm.Wahram kneeled next to her and put an arm around her shoulders; she seemed to be trying to put her arms over his helmet while ducking hers against his chest.Looking over her, he saw that the tracks where the platform had been had disappeared in a big ball of dust, and the very top of the dust cloud was now high enough to be up in the sunlight.The brilliant yellow of the sunlit part of the cloud illuminated the land around it like a beacon of fire.The land at the foot of the cloud was glowing with a light of its own; it appeared to be a pool of smoking lava.A meteor, he said stupidly.Swan was talking on the common band.A few more rocks fell on the land around them, invisible until announced by an explosion of dust.It looked like the land was exploding, as if mines were going off.Occasionally a falling rock was hot and looked like a shooting star.Some ember blinks were still up there flying among the stars.They would get hit or they wouldnt: an awful feeling.Guarding their helmets did not seem like it was going to do much good.Dust flew up over them, fell back to land in lazy sheets and veils.Gray topped by yellow; but when the top of the dust cloud fell back below the horizontal beams of approaching sunlight, they were plunged into the darkness of Mercurial night, with only the distant lit crater wall to illuminate them with its reflection.Red bars still pulsed vertically in the middle of Wahrams sight.It seemed much dimmer than it had before.Theres a group of sunwalkers just south of here, up under the crater wall, Swan said grimly.She asked a question on the common band.One of thems been hit, and they need help.Come on.He followed her away from the tracks, feeling blind and confused.Was it a meteor strike?Looks like it.Although the tracks have a detect and deflect system, so I dont know what happened.Come on, weve got to hurry!I want to get back to the city.Its ohhh.She groaned as the realization appeared to strike her that the city was doomed.No!she cried as she dragged him southward.No, no, no, no, no, no, no.Over and over as they stumbled along.Then: How could it be.He couldnt tell if it was a rhetorical question.Dont know, he said.She tugged at him and he kept his eyes on the ground to keep from kicking a rock and falling.Rocks littered the land.He tried to remember what he had seen; had it been a flash?From above?Hadnt it risen?Noa downward motion.He closed his eyes, but the red bar and light red clouds still bounced around on the black backdrop of the insides of his eyelids.He opened his eyes, glanced at Swan.Later perhaps they could review her qubes visual record, assuming it kept one.She was muttering now in the irritated tone of voice she seemed to use only when addressing it.She led him around a hillock, and when they had cleared it, they spotted a group of three people in spacesuits, all three walking, which was good to see, but with one holding one arm with the other hand, and walking awkwardly as a result.The other two flanked this one, helping or trying to.Hey!Swan said on the common band, and they looked up and saw them approaching.One waved.Swan and Wahram joined them a few minutes later.How are you?Swan said.Happy to be alive, said the one holding an arm.I got hit on the arm!I can see.Lets get back to the city.What happened?A meteor hit the tracks, it looked like.How could that be?I dont know.Come on!Without further discussion the five of them began walking at speed toward the tracks, striding along in a Martian lope that made the best of the local g.  Wahram was all right at it because of his time on Titan, which was about half as heavy as this, but similar enough.Together they bounded down the mild slope, angling eastward to intercept the city as soon as possible.There was a strange keening in Wahrams ear, an animal moan of distress; at first he thought it was the hurt sunwalker, but then realized it was Swan.Of course it was her city, her home.They came over a rise that gave them a view of the top half of the citys dome, bulging over the horizon like the blue bubble of a pocket universe.The city appeared to be moving still.The tracks ahead of it are damaged, he said.Yes, of course!Is there a way for it to get past a section of broken track?No!How would that work?I dont know, Im just wondering.It seems like most support systems try to avoid criticalities.Of course.But the tracks are protected, theres an anti meteor system!It must not have worked?Apparently not!Again she cried out, a piercing sound in his ear even when damped by his suits intercom.The sunwalkers were chattering among themselves, sounding worried.What will we do when we get to it?Wahram asked on the common band.Swan stopped groaning and said, What do you mean?Are there lifeboats?You knowrovers to drive to the nearest spaceport?Yes, of course.Enough for everyone?Yes!And are there spaceships enough at the nearest spaceport?Enough for the whole population of Terminator?Theres shelter in all the spaceports, enough to hold a lot of people.And vehicles to go west to the next ones.And some hoppers can handle being on the brightside.As they hurried across the black rubbly plain, Terminator slowly hove up over the horizon.The upper half of the interior of the Dawn Wall was now visible, looking much steeper than it really was, all whitewashed walls and trees.A thick bar of green marked the treetops of the park.Extending forward from the trees were the crops of the farm.A snow globe on silver tracks, headed to its doom.They could see no people in the city, even though it was now looming above them.Certainly no one was on the terraces of the Dawn Wall anymore.It looked abandoned.And there was no way to get up into it.The platform had been in the impact zone.Everyone who had been at the concert must have been killed.Inside the city they could see a trio of deer: buck, doe, fawn.Swans cries pitched up an octave.No.No!It was strange to be standing there, looking up at the empty citys Mediterranean calm.Swan ran under the tracks to the north side of the city, and the rest of them followed.From that side they could see a little convoy of ground vehicles far to the north and west, rolling away from them through the break in Beethovens northwest wall.The cars were fast, and soon over the horizon.Theyve left, Wahram observed.Yes yes.Pauline?I suppose we could walk to the spaceport?Wahram said, worried.Swan was talking to her internal qube, however, and Wahram couldnt follow the gist of the exchange.Her tone of voice was utterly caustic.She broke off that argument and said to him, The cars arent coming back.The city will stop automatically when it hits the break in the tracks.We have to leave.Every tenth platform has elevators that go down to shelters under the tracks, so we have to get to one of those.How near is the closest one to the west?About ninety kilometers.The town just passed one back to the east.Ninety kilometers!Yes.Well need to go east.Its only nine kilometers.Our suits will handle the sunlight for the time it will take us.Wahram said, Maybe we could walk the ninety.No we couldnt, what do you mean?I think we could.People have done it.Athletes who have trained for it have done it.I do enough walking to know, and maybe I could do it, but you couldnt.You cant do it by willpower alone.And this sunwalker is hurt.No, listen, well be all right going into the sunlight.Its just the corona well be exposed to, and no more than an hour or a little more.Ive done it often.Id rather not.You have no choice!Come on, the longer we dither, the longer well be exposed!That was true.All right, then, he said, and felt his heart pound inside him.She turned around, held out her arms up to the city, groaned like an animal.Oh, my town, my town, ohhhh Well come back!Well rebuild!Ohhhhh  Behind the glassy face mask her face was wet with tears.She noticed him watching her and swung a hand back as if to strike at him.Come on, we have to go!She gestured to the three sunwalkers.Come on!As they started running east, Swan howled over the common band, a sound like an alarm siren that had done its duty but continued on in the emptiness after a disaster.The figure running before him did not seem capable of generating such a terrible sound, which stuck him like pins in the ears.A lot of animals had no doubt been left behind insidethe whole little terrarium, a community of plants and animals.And she designed such things.And this one was her home.Suddenly her howl made it clear to him that saving the humans of the place was not really enough.So much got left behind.A whole world.If a world dies, its people dont matter anymoreso the howl seemed to say.Dawn kept coming, as always.Now this was an interesting matter: could he modulate his fear, rein it in and use it to impel him at the optimum pace for the quickest arrival at the platform out there to the east, in the raw light of daybreak?And did that pace match the pace that was going to be set for him by the person he was following?For Swan was moaning still, crying and cursing, keening in a rhythm that was keyed to her running; she bounced forward on the impact of her strides, perhaps helpless to go slower; and yet she was moving faster than he could match.He had to give ground and keep to his own pace, and hope that he would at least be able to keep the distance close enough that he wouldnt lose her over the horizon.Although of course the tracks would lead him right to the platform, so even if she disappeared over the horizon, that should not matter.And yet he did not want to lose sight of her.The three sunwalkers were already a considerable distance ahead of her, even the one with the hurt arm.So maybe the unhappy noise she was making was in fact slowing her down.The land dipped and rose here in such a way that he could see many kilometers to the north, and the highlands in that direction were now all ablaze with sunlight.That lit part of the landscape threw light over the shadowed terrain they ran in, and Wahram saw the rumples in the land, and the rubble on it, better than he had ever seen anything before, not just on Mercury but anywhere.Everything looked coated by a layer of friable powder, no doubt the result of the daily bake and freeze.The light from the north grew so bright he had to look away to preserve his vision for the dark places underfoot and before him.Ahead the moaning silhouette bounded against the stars.He forced his breath into a rhythm with his feet, watched the ground he was running on, focused on a rapid efficient gait.One third g could be deceptive, being neither light nor heavy.It had the potential for speedy running, but a fall was not a trivial thing, especially in this situation.Swan was on home ground and did not appear to be thinking of him at all.He ran on.Normally the distance involved would be for him a matter of about forty five minutes of running, he reckoned, depending on terrain.That was long enough to call for restraint from full speed, even for runners.Was she going out too fast?He saw no signs of deceleration.On the other hand, she was not getting farther ahead.And he was now in a pace he thought he could sustain.It was neither fast nor slow.He huffed and puffed, watched the ground carefully.Quick glances showed Swan always well short of the horizon.It was all going to work outthen he stumbled and had to catch himself up by way of some desperate windmilling of the arms, after which he kept his head down and focused on the ground more than ever.It was one of those moments when the shock of the unexpected throws one into a different space.He could see Swans boot prints superimposed on the palimpsest of earlier prints.Her stride was shorter than his.He flew over her steps, even though he was losing ground on her.The sunwalkers were halfway over the horizon.Swans moaning still filled his ears, but he refused to let himself turn down the volume or turn it off.Then the sun blinked over the horizon, and again he felt his heart pounding.At first, licks of orange fire popped over the horizon and disappeared.The corona was hotter than the actual surface of the sun by a great deal, as he recalled.Magnetic surges, bowing up in characteristic loops of fire, rising majestically over the horizon and hanging there before blasting off to one side or the other.The suns flames, in effect, flying up in stupendous explosions guided by the magnetic fields that roiled in the burn.He ran on looking down at the ground, but the next time he glanced up most of the horizon ahead of him was orangethe sun itself, its orangeness stuffed and writhing with bubbles and banners of yellow.To stop it down to something his eyes could handle, his faceplate had to render the rest of the cosmos black.The horizon was the only thing that could be clearly picked out, a line out there not very high, not smooth, various hills and dips that bounced and blurred.Swan stood out blackly, a runner imago, her silhouette thinned by white light pouring around her.The ground underfoot was now a salt and pepper pattern impossible to read, aching white and deep black all jumbled together so that the white parts pulsed and shimmered in his vision.He had to trust it was flat enough to run, because it didnt look like it.And then after another while it became a black chipped white that looked flat as a sheet.They were out in full day.He began to sweat.Probably this was just fear, and the sudden helpless acceleration in his pace.His suit began to hum audibly in its effort to cool him, a slight but terrible sound.His sweat would slide down his flanks and legs and collect at a seal above the boots.He didnt think enough could collect to drown him, but he wasnt sure.The black flicker of Swan in the sun had become a sort of spectre of the Brocken, exploding in and out of existence in vibrant pulses.He thought he saw her look over her shoulder at him, but he did not dare wave to her lest he lose his balance and fall.She seemed short, and suddenly he saw she was visible now only from the knees up.The horizon was about as far away as it would be on Titan.That meant he was probably only five or ten minutes behind her.Then the platform top appeared over the horizon just to her left, next to the southernmost track, and he quickened his pace yet again.In any physical endeavor a little kick at the end could usually be found.This time, however, it seemed he was truly stretched to his maximum.Indeed it very quickly turned into something more like a desperate attempt to hold what speed he had.He was gasping, and had to force himself to a breath pattern in a rhythm coordinated with his pounding heavy legs, one gasp for two strikes.It was very frightening to look up and see almost the whole visible stretch of the eastern horizon topped by the corona; the slight curve of it seemed to suggest it would eventually fill most of the sky, as if what was rising before them was some kind of universal sun.Mercury looked like a bowling ball rolling into that light.His sweat now filled his suit to his thighs, and he wondered again if he could drown in it.But then again, he could drink it and save himself.Happily his air supply was still cool in his face.His faceplate polarization shifted, and the texture of the sun through the black glass of his faceplate articulated into thousands of tongues of flame.Big fields of tendrils moved in concert, whole regions swirling like cats paws on water.It looked like a living being, a creature made of fire.The platform was a block of black in the black, Swan a black movement beside it.He reached her, stopped, gasped for a while with his hands on his knees, his back to the sun.Her keening had stopped, although from time to time she still moaned.The sunwalkers apparently had already taken the elevator down; she was waiting for it to come back up.Im sorry, he said when he could speak.Sorry Im late.She was looking at the sun, now four fingers high over the jagged black horizon.Oh my God, look at it, she said.Just look at it.Wahram tried, but it was too bright, too big.Then a loop of the corona flew hugely higher than any they had yet seen, as if the sun were trying to reach out and burn them with a touch.Oh no!Swan cried out, and pulled Wahram over to her and against the door, moving to his sun side and pulling him down to shield him with herself, punching elevator buttons over his shoulder and cursing.Come on hurry!she yelled.Oh thats a big flare, thats bad.By the time you see one of those its already zapped you.Finally the elevator doors slid open and the two of them rushed in.The doors closed.They felt the elevator car drop.When Wahrams faceplate and eyes had adjusted to the ordinary light, he saw that Swans face under her faceplate was wet with tears and snot.She sniffed hard.Damn that was a big flare, she said, wiping her face.When the elevator stopped and they got out, she said to the sunwalkers, Any of you have a dosimeter on you?One of them replied as if quoting: If you want to know, you dont want to know.She looked at Wahram, her expression grim in a way he had never seen.Pauline?she said.Find the dosimeter in this suit.She listened for a while, then clutched her chest, staggered down to one knee.Oh shit, she said faintly.Im killed.How much did you get?Wahram exclaimed, alarmed.He checked his wristpad; it showed a radiation spike of 3.762 sieverts, and he hissed.They would be needing a lot of DNA repair the next time they got their treatmentsif they could make it.He repeated his question: How much did you get?She stood up and would not look at him.I dont want to talk about it.That was quite a slice of the sun, he said.Its not that, she said.It was that flare.Bad luck.The sunwalkers nodded at this, and Wahram felt a little queasy jolt slither down his spine.They were in a lock.The elevator doors closed behind them, the door on the other side of the lock slid open, followed by a little whoosh of air.They went into a low room of some considerable size, with several doors and passageways leading out of it.Is this a refuge?Wahram asked.Do we have to stay here through the brightside crossing?Can we?This is part of a whole system, Swan explained.It was built to help with the construction of the tracks.Every tenth platform has a unit like this under it, and theres a utilidor that connects them all.A work tunnel.The sunwalkers were already checking some of the cabinet doors on one wall.So we could hurry underground in this tunnel and catch up to the nightside?Get to help?Yes.But I wonder if the part under the meteor strike is still passable.I guess we can go see.Its all heated and aerated?Yes.After some people died when they came down to take shelter, the stations have been made minimally survivable.Actually, I think you have to re aerate the utilidor section by section as you go along.Its like turning on the lights.One of the sunwalkers gave a thumbs up, and Swan took off her helmet and Wahram did too.Do either of you have radio comms?one of them asked.Ours arent working, and were thinking maybe the sun fried them.And the phone here isnt working.We wont be able to tell people were down here.Pauline, are you all right?Swan said aloud, and fell silent.How is your qube?Wahram asked after a while.Shes all right, Swan said dismissively.She says my head served as good insulation for her.Oh dear.They followed the sunwalkers down the hall, took stairs down to a set of large rooms below.The biggest room down there contained a scattering of couches and low tables, and the long bar of a communal kitchen.Swan introduced herself and Wahram to the three sunwalkers, who were people of indeterminate age and gender.They nodded politely at Swans introduction, but did not identify themselves.How is your arm?Swan asked the hurt one.Its broken, the person said simply, and held it out a little.Clean hit, but the rock was small and just falling, I guess.Tossed up in the big hit.Now it seemed to Wahram that this one at least was young.Well wrap it, one of the others said, also young.We can try to straighten it, and then wrap it with a support, no matter how straight it is.Did any of you see the meteor strike?Swan asked.They all three shook their heads.All young, Wahram thought.These were the kinds of people who walked around Mercury right before sunrise, torching themselves with solar visions.Although apparently Swan was also one of them.The young in spirit, then.What are we going to do?he asked.We can take the utilidor west till we get to the next spaceport on the nightside, one of them said.Do you think the utilidor is still passable under the hit?Swan asked.Oh, the one said.I didnt think of that.It might be, said the one with the broken forearm.The third one was looking in cabinets against the wall.You never know.I doubt it, Swan said.But I guess we can go look.Its only about fifteen klicks away.Only fifteen!Wahram didnt say.They stood there looking at each other.Well, shit, Swan said.Lets go take a look.I dont want to just sit here.Wahram suppressed a sigh.It was not as if they had a great number of choices.And if they could get through to the west, and hurried, they could catch up to the night, and hopefully the spaceport where the people from Terminator had gone.So they went to a door at the west end of the room and went through it into a passageway, lit dimly by a string of overhead lights that were part of the ceiling.The walls of the tunnel were raw faces of rock, in some places cracked, in others bare walls with drill bit marks angling upward on their left and downward on their right.They hiked west at a good clip.The one with the broken arm seemed to be the fastest of them all, although one of the other sunwalkers stuck close by the hurt one.No one spoke.An hour passed; then, after a short rest sitting on some cubical blocks of rock in the tunnel, another hour.Did your Pauline get an image of the strike?Wahram asked Swan when they were walking again.The utilidor was wide enough for three or four people to walk abreast, as the sunwalkers were proving ahead of them.Ive looked, but its just a flash to one side.Only a few milliseconds of light before the explosion upward and out, coming down fast and hot.But why hot?Theres no atmosphere to heat it, so that doesnt make sense.It kind of looks like it came from, I dont know, somewhere else.From some other universe.Seems like some other explanation will be forthcoming, Wahram could not help saying.Well, you explain it, she said sharply, as if speaking to her qube.I cant, Wahram said calmly.They walked on in silence.Presumably at some point they were walking underneath the city.Above them, Terminator would be burning up in the days rain of light.Then the tunnel ahead of them appeared to end.They had all put their helmets back on, as it was the easiest way to carry them, and now they shone their helmets headlamps into the darkness before them.A mass of rock rubble filled the tunnel, floor to roof.It was cold here, and suddenly Swan said, Wed better seal our helmets, and her faceplate slid down.Wahram did the same.They stood there looking at the blockage.All right, Swan said grimly.Cant go west.Well have to go east, I guess.But how long will that take?Wahram said.She shrugged.If we sit here, it will be eighty eight days till sunset.If we walk, it will be less.Walk around half of Mercury?Less than half, because we will be walking and the planet will be rolling.Thats the point.I mean, what else are we going to do?Im not going to sit here for three months!She was almost in tears, he saw.How far is it again?he asked, thinking half of Titan as he said it.His stomach contracted within him.About two thousand kilometers.But if we walk east at, say, thirty kilometers a day, we shorten the wait time to something more like forty days.So we can cut it in half.That seems worth it to me.And it doesnt have to be continuous walking.I mean, its not like the sunwalkers.We walk a days worth, eat, sleep a night, then walk again.Set a daily schedule.If we hiked for twelve hours out of every twenty four, that would be a lot, but it would save even more days.What, Pauline?Can you turn up Paulines voice again?Wahram requested.I dont want to now.She says twelve hour days of walking would shorter our time down here by around forty five days.Thats enough for me.Well, Wahram said.Thats a lot of walking.I know, but what are you going to do?Sit here for over twice as long?No, he said slowly.I guess not.Although really it would not be so very long.A rereading of Proust and OBrian, a few times through the Ring cycle; his little wristpad was very well stocked.But the way she stood there looking at him, these were not thoughts he felt comfortable expressing.Ill turn up Pauline, she said, as if giving him something in exchange for his agreement.Solvitur ambulando, Pauline said.Latin for It is solved by walking.Diogenes of Sinope.Thus you prove motion is real, Wahram supposed.Yes.Wahram sighed.I was already convinced.Back at the first underground station they took stock.The three sunwalkers were perfectly happy to walk for six or seven weeks; it was very like their usual mode of existence.Their names were Tron, Tor, and Nar.They were gender nondescripts as far as Wahram was concerned, and seemed to him very young and simple.They lived only to hike around Mercury; they seemed to know nothing more than that, or perhaps they didnt speak much to strangers.But what they did say seemed childlike to him, or provincial in the extreme.There were whole terraria filled with such folk, of course, but he had gotten used to thinking of the Mercurials as highly sophisticated, steeped in history and art and culture.Now he was learning that it was not universally true.He realized he had thought sun worshippers would be followers of the various early solar religions of ancient Egypt, Persia, the Incabut no.They just liked the sun.It looked like they were going to have to spend a couple of nights sleeping on the floor of the unimproved tunnel in between each way station.Every third day, Swan said, we can resupply.It sets a good goal.We might even be able to go farther, Tron said shyly.Tron was the one with the broken arm, so Wahram refrained from mentioning that for him personally, thirty three kilometers a day might prove enough, or too much.That he might be the drag on this group was discouraging.In any case Swan was overseeing the filling of backpacks she had found in the emergency supply cabinets: their spacesuit helmets, some emergency air, water bottles, food, air mattresses, a little pot and stove.A roll of aerogel blankets, not very warm looking, but the utilidor would stay at this temperature, Swan said; and it was pretty warm.So: tunnel walk.Possibly similar to spelunking expeditions of long duration.Little headlamps were included in the packs too, although for now they were not necessary, as the ceiling held a warm square of yellow white light every twenty meters or so, illuminating the rough rock of the utilidor very well.They were about fifteen meters underground, Swan said.The tunnel had been drilled through bedrock or regolith, with a heat finish that had imparted frequent swirls and dashes of mineral color, reminiscent of the cut surfaces of certain meteorites.In some stretches silver curves lay over pewter, then jet black.The floor had been chipped to a texture that made for a good grip underfoot.The tight curve of Mercury meant that the most distant overhead lights merged into a single bar of light.It was as if they could see the arc of the planet, which Wahram found vaguely encouraging.He was finding the idea of thirty three kilometers a day, for more than forty days in a row, daunting.Must recall they were down around the forty fifth latitude south here, so the distance was not as far as it would have been if they were on the equator.Sometimes Terminators tracks went even farther south, as he recalled.Things could be worse.So.Walk for an hour, in a tunnel that changed very little, and only in iterative ways.Stop, sit on the ground, rest for a while; then walk an hour more.At the end of three hours, stop and eat.Already that interval felt very long, something like a week or more in ordinary human time, in the time of thinking.But they did that three times before stopping to eat a larger meal, then slept for eight or nine hours.Hour, hour, hour; hour, hour, hour; hour, hour, hour.The sensation of lengthening time grew very strong in Wahram.Why it should feel so long was hard to tell; the repetition of the elements of the day he would have thought might streamline and thus speed the hours; but no.Instead it was protraction, a very pronounced feeling of protraction.At the end of each day, as he settled down, footsore and exhausted, to sleep, he could stretch out on his air mattress and say, One down, thirty seven to go, or even thirty three to go, and feel a little stab of despair.Every hour felt like a week!Could they endure it?The sunwalkers usually hiked a bit ahead, and by the time Wahram and Swan joined them at a stop, they were always prepping tea.Then, well before Wahram was ready to get up and go again, the young ferals were off, almost apologetically, with a nod and a wave.His days, therefore, were spent mostly with Swan.She was clearly not happy at the prospect of this hike, even though it was her idea.She was doing it only because the alternative was worse, in her estimation.It was something to be endured, in misery mute or voluble.Some days she went ahead, some days fell behind.Im going to get sick at some point, she said once.It became clear to Wahram that she liked the situation even less than he didfar less than he did, as she told him herself.She hated it, she said; suffered from claustrophobia; could not stand to be indoors; needed copious daily sunlight; needed lots of variety in her daily routines and in her sensory stimuli.These were necessities, she told Wahram, and in no uncertain terms.This is so horrible, she exclaimed often, making the word an emphatic three syllables with fore and aft stresses.Horrible, horrible, horrible.I wont be able to make it.Lets talk about something else, Wahram would suggest.How can I?Its horrrr i bull.Endless repetition of these points would still occupy only the first hour of their twelve hour day of walking and rests.After such a first hour, Wahram would usually decide it was appropriate to point out that they would need to talk about something else if they were to avoid undue repetition stress on both their parts.Tired of me already?Swan concluded from these observations.Not at all.Vastly entertained.Even interested.But this motif, of the unhappy voyage of necessity, its limited.Its played out.I want a different story.Thats lucky for you, because I was going to change the subject.Lucky for me indeed.She trudged on ahead of him.There was no reason to hurry to say the next thing; they had all day.Wahram watched her walk ahead of him: her stride was graceful and long, she was in her home g and sinuous, efficient.Very quickly she could get well ahead of him.She did not seem ill yet.From behind he sometimes heard her having conversations with her qube.For whatever reason, she had shifted Paulines voice to exterior audibility; maybe she was keeping that little promise to him.The conversations between the two almost always sounded like arguments; Swans voice was clearer and more hectoring, but Paulines alto, slightly muffled by Swans own skin, was somehow mulishly contentious as well.Depending on how one programmed them, qubes could be real fiends for argument, quibblers to the highest degree.Once Wahram caught up enough to be able to eavesdrop on them, and came in on something that had been going on for a while; Swan was saying, Poor Pauline, if I were you I would be so sad!I feel so sorry for you!It must feel terrible to be nothing but a packet of algorithms!Pauline said, This is the rhetorical device called anacoenesis, in which one pretends to put oneself in the place of ones opponent.No, not at all, Swan assured her.I really am sympathetic.To be so few qubits, to be just algorithms grinding it out.I mean considering that, you do very well.Pauline said, This is the rhetorical device called synchoresis, in which one makes a concession before renewing the assault.Maybe youre right.I dont really know why I thought you were stupid, given the huge power of these arguments of yours.And yet  This is both sarcasm and aporia in the bad sense I mentioned before, of a momentary expression of doubt, often faked, before renewing the attack.And this is the defense called casuistry, where when youve got nothing you retreat into a cloud of verbiage.Maybe youre right, maybe its just smart consciousness and stupid consciousness.That would explain a lot.Pauline did not seem to be deterred.Happy to submit our speech acts to a double blind study to see if any distinctions at all can be made between yours and mine.Really?Swan said.Are you saying you can pass a Turing test?It depends whos asking the questions.Swan laughed scornfully, but she really was amused, Wahram could hear it.So at least the qube was good for that.The two of them swapped the lead every half hour, just to mark time and change the view, such as it was.They did not always talk; it would have been impossible, he thought.In any case they hiked in silence for many minutes at a time.Over them the tunnel lights seemed to move independently backward, as if they walked at the top of a vast Ferris wheel, and only just kept pace with the backward sweep of the wheel.At the end of an hour Wahrams feet were sore, and he was happy to sit down.They used their aerogel sleeping pads as cushions to sit on.Meals came from foil envelopes found in the emergency gear at the stations, and were bland for the most part.After a while they mostly only wanted to drink water, though there were some powders to mix in if one wanted.In general their rests were about half an hour long.Any longer and Wahram began to stiffen up, and Swan became fretful.And the sunwalkers would get too far ahead.So Wahram would heave himself to his feet and take off again.Do you think any of these stations have walking poles in them?I doubt it.We can look at the next one.Maybe something could be used as canes.After a time of silence she would sometimes snap.All right tell me something!Tell me about yourself!Whats your first memory?I dont know, Wahram said, trying to locate it.My first memory, she said, comes from a time that my parents tell me I was three.My parents were part of a house that decided to move to the other side of the city.I think we were trading places north to south, in order to look at the other half of the countryside as we passed by it.Or maybe they just told me that.So a bunch of carts were there, and both houses were moving stuff back and forth.Everything my family owned could fit on the back of one battery cart and two handcarts.My mother took me back inside when the place was emptied, and it scared me.I think thats why I remember it.My room looked much smaller when it was empty, and that seemed backward and scared me, like the world had shrunk.We fill rooms to make them bigger.Then we went back outside, and the other image that sticks with me, along with the empty room, was all the stuff in the bed of the cart, and everyone standing by it at the curb, under a set of trees.Above some trees I could see the Dawn Wall.She hiked on for a time in silence, and Wahram felt the empty grumble in his stomach that marked another mealtimes approach.By now thats all burned down, she said.But now her voice was unusually calm.She was no longer grieving in the same way, it seemed.When the sun got high enough that the city was out of the shade of the Dawn Wall, she added, it would go quick.I know the tracks dont melt on the brightside, Wahram said.Anything else?The city infrastructure will be fine, she conceded.The shell.Some metals, ceramics, mixes of the two.Glassy metals.And then just ordinary tempered steel, stainless steel.Austenite steel.Well see.I suppose it will be interesting to see what it looks like when night falls on it again.Everything will have burned away except the frame, I guess.As soon as the sun hit, the plants would begin to die.Theyll be dead by now, all the plants and animals, even the bacteria and such.Well have to rebuild it.Maybe, he said.What do you mean?Well, I think theyll want to understand what happened to the tracks, and feel they are in a position to stop it happening again.Or else build to a different design.Free the city from its tracks, maybe, and roll over the landscape on wheels.That would require some locomotion, she pointed out.As it is, the expansion of the tracks drives the city forward.Well, it will be interesting to see what happens, then.Wahram hesitated.It would be pointless to rebuild and then have a recurrence.If it was a low likelihood accident, then a recurrence wouldnt be likely.I was under the impression that all such happenstances were already guarded against.Me too.Are you suggesting that it was some kind of attack?Yes, well, Ive been thinking about that, anyway.I mean, consider what happened to us on Io.But who would want to attack Terminator?she demanded.Attack it and yet miss it by a few kilometers, killing the town but leaving the people alive?I dont know, Wahram said uneasily.Theres been talk about the conflict between Earth and Mars, how it could even lead to war.Yes, she said, but the talk always goes on to declare this impossible, because everyone is so vulnerable.Mutual assured destruction, as always.Ive always wondered about that, Wahram admitted.What if a first strike is made to look like an accident, and is so successful that no one knows who did it, and meanwhile the victim is mostly vaporized?A scenario like that might make one think there is not any certain mutually assured destruction.Who would feel that way?Swan asked.Almost any power on Earth could make the calculation.Theyre safer than any of us.And Mars is notoriously self absorbed, and also cant be punctured with a single dart.No, Im not convinced there cant be a power out there that harbors a feeling of invulnerability.Or an anger so great they dont care about consequences.What could that be, though?Swan said.What causes that kind of anger?I dont know say food, water, land power prestige ideology differential advantage.Madness.These are the usual motives, arent they?I suppose!She sounded horrified that he could make such a list, as if this were not part of Mercurial discourse, although really it was simply Machiavelli, or Aristotle.Pauline would know the list.Anyway, he went on, Ill be very interested to find out what people are saying when we get out of here.Only thirty days to go, she said grimly.One step at a time, he said gamely.Oh please!Take it like that and its eternity.Not at all.But I will desist.After a while he said, Interesting how a moment comes when you feel hungry.You didnt before, and then you do.Thats not interesting.My feet are sore.Thats not interesting either.Each step is a little pain, or every other.Plantar fasciitis, I reckon.Would you like to take a rest?No.Theyre only sore, not hurt.And they get warmed up.Then tired.I hate this.And yet here we are.The hour of walking passed.The rest period passed.The next hour passed.The rest following that passed.The tunnel stayed always the same.The stations every third night were almost the same, but not quite.They ransacked these places, looking for something different.Up at the top of the elevator shafts in each station lay the surface, exposed to the full Mercurial sun and approaching seven hundred K on surfaces struck by light; there being no air, there was no air temperature.At this point they were under Tolstoi Crater, more or less; Pauline was managing their navigation, such as it was, by a sort of dead reckoning; down here her little radio too was out of touch.The station phones never worked.Swan guessed they were elevator phones onlyor else the whole system had broken in the impact, and because of the ongoing situation with Terminators population, and the fact that the crushed part of the tunnel was now out in the sun, no one was available to fix it.Hour after hour they walked.It was easy to lose track of days, particularly since Pauline would keep track.The pseudoiterative was less pseudo than ever.This was the true iterative.Swan walked before Wahram, her shoulders slumped like those of a mime portraying dejection.Minutes dragged until each one felt like ten; it was an exponential expansion of time, a syruping of protraction.They would therefore live ten times as long.He cast about for something to say that would not irritate her.She was muttering at Pauline.I used to whistle when I was a kid, he said, and tried a single tone.His lips felt thicker than they had when he was young.Oh yestongue higher against roof of mouth.Very good.I would whistle the melodies from the symphonies I liked.Whistle, then, Swan said.I whistle too.Really!he said.Yes.I told you.But you first.Do you do Beethoven, like what we heard at that concert?I do, kind of.Just some of the tunes.Do that, then.There had been a period in Wahrams youth when every morning had had to begin with Beethovens Eroica, the breakthrough Third Symphony, announcement of a new age in music and indeed in the human spirit, written after Beethoven learned that he was going deaf.So Wahram whistled the two commanding notes that started the first movement, and then whistled the main line, at a tempo that fit with his walking pace.That wasnt so hard to do, somehow.As he whistled along he was never sure he was going to remember the passage that came next, yet by the time he got to the point of change, the next one followed inevitably from it, and flowed from him quite satisfactorily.Somewhere in him these things remained.The sequence of long elaborate melodies flowed one to the next, in just the compelling logic of Beethovens own thinking.And this sequence consisted of one stirring inevitable song after another.Most of the passages should have been stranded by counterpoint and polyphonies, and he jumped from one orchestral section to another, depending on which one seemed the main line.But it had to be said that even as single tunes, inexpertly whistled, the magnificence of Beethovens music was palpable in the tunnel.The three sunwalkers drifted back, it seemed, to hear it better.After the first movement was over, Wahram found the other three movements came as fully to him as the first, so that by the time he was done, it had taken him about the same forty minutes that an orchestra would have taken with the real thing.The great variations of the finale were so stirring that he almost hyperventilated in the performance of it.Wonderful, Swan said when he was done.Really good.What tunes.My God.Do more.Can you do more?Wahram had to laugh.He thought it over.Well, I think I could do the Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh, and Ninth.Also some bits of the quartets and sonatas, maybe.
