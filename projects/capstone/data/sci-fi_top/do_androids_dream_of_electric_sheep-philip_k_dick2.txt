And dont listen in on the conversation; its confidential.He glared at her.Yes, sir, Miss Marsten said.Go ahead and dial.She then cut herself out of the circuit, leaving him to face the outside world.He dialedby memorythe number of the false animal shop at which he had gotten his ersatz sheep.On the small vidscreen a man dressed like a vet appeared.Dr.McRae, the man declared.This is Deckard.How much is an electric ostrich?Oh, Id say we could fix you up for less than eight hundred dollars.How soon did you want delivery?We would have to make it up for you; theres not that much call for  Ill talk to you later, Rick interrupted; glancing at his watch he saw that nine thirty had arrived.Good by.He hurriedly hung up, rose, and shortly thereafter stood before Inspector Bryants office door.He passed by Bryants receptionistattractive, with waist length braided silver hairand then the inspectors secretary, an ancient monster from the Jurassic swamp, frozen and sly, like some archaic apparition fixated in the tomb world.Neither woman spoke to him nor he to them.Opening the inner door he nodded to his superior, who was busy on the phone; seating himself he got out the specs on Nexus 6, which he had brought with him, and once more read them over as Inspector Bryant talked away  He felt depressed.And yet, logically, because of Daves sudden disappearance from the work scene, he should be at least guardedly pleased.4  Maybe Im worried, Rick Deckard conjectured, that what happened to Dave will happen to me.An andy smart enough to laser him could probably take me, too.But that didnt seem to be it.I see you brought the poop sheet on that new brain unit, Inspector Bryant said, hanging up the vidphone.Rick said, Yeah, I heard about it on the grapevine.How many andys are involved and how far did Dave get?Eight to start with, Bryant said, consulting his clipboard.Dave got the first two.And the remaining six are here in Northern California?As far as we know.Dave thinks so.That was him I was talking to.I have his notes; they were in his desk.He says all he knows is here.Bryant tapped the bundle of notepaper.So far he did not seem inclined to pass the notes on to Rick; for some reason he continued to leaf through them himself, frowning and working his tongue in and around the fringes of his mouth.I have nothing on I my agenda, Rick offered.Im ready to take over in Daves place.Bryant said thoughtfully, Dave used the Voigt Kampff Altered Scale in testing out the individuals he suspected.You realizeyou ought to, anyhowthat this test isnt specific for the new brain units.No test is; the Voigt scale, altered three years ago by Kampff, is all we have.He paused, pondering.Dave considered it accurate.Maybe it is.But I would suggest this, before you take out after these six.Again he tapped the pile of notes.Fly to Seattle and talk with the Rosen people.Have them supply you a representative sampling of types employing the new Nexus 6 unit.And put them through the Voigt Kampff, Rick said.It sounds so easy, Bryant said, half to himself.Pardon?Bryant said, I think Ill talk to the Rosen organization myself, while youre on your way.He eyed Rick, then, silently.Finally he grunted, gnawed on a fingernail, and eventually decided on what he wanted to say.Im going to discuss with them the possibility of including several humans, as well as their new androids.But you wont know.Itll be my decision, in conjunction with the manufacturers.It should be set up by the time you get there.He abruptly pointed at Rick, his face severe.This is the first time youll be acting as senior bounty bunter.Dave knows a lot; hes got years of experience behind him.So have I, Rick said tensely.Youve handled assignments devolving to you from Daves schedule; hes always decided exactly which ones to turn over to you and which not to.But now youve got six that he intended to retire himselfone of which managed to get him first.This one.Bryant turned the notes around so that Rick could see.Max Polokov, Bryant said.Thats what it calls itself, anyhow.Assuming Dave was right.Everything is based on that assumption, this entire list.And yet the Voigt Kampff Altered Scale has only been administered to the first three, the two Dave retired and then Polokov.It was while Dave was administering the test; thats when Polokov lasered him.Which proves that Dave was right, Rick said.Otherwise he would not have been lasered; Polokov would have no motive.You get started for Seattle, Bryant said.Dont tell them first; Ill handle it.Listen.He rose to his feet, soberly confronted Rick.When you run the Voigt Kampff scale up there, if one of the humans fails to pass it  That cant happen, Rick said.One day, a few weeks ago, I talked with Dave about exactly that.He had been thinking along the same lines.I had a memo from the Soviet police, W. P. O.  itself, circulated throughout Earth plus the colonies.A group of psychiatrists in Leningrad have approached W. P. O.  with the following proposition.They want the latest and most accurate personality profile analytical tools used in determining the presence of an androidin other words the Voigt Kampff scaleapplied to a carefully selected group of schizoid and schizophrenic human patients.Those, specifically, which reveal whats called a flattening of affect.Youve heard of that.Rick said, Thats specifically what the scale measures.Then you understand what theyre worried about.This problem has always existed.Since we first encountered androids posing as humans.The consensus of police opinion is known to you in Lurie Kampff s article, written eight years ago.Role taking Blockage in the Undeteriorated Schizophrenic.Kampff compared the diminished emphatic faculty found in human mental patients and a superficially similar but basically  The Leningrad psychiatrists, Bryant broke in brusquely, think that a small class of human beings could not pass the Voigt Kampff scale.If you tested them in line with police work youd assess them as humanoid robots.Youd be wrong, but by then theyd be dead.He was silent, now, waiting for Ricks answer.But these individuals, Rick said, would all be  Theyd be in institutions, Bryant agreed.They couldnt conceivably function in the outside world; they certainly couldnt go undetected as advanced psychoticsunless of course their breakdown had come recently and suddenly and no one had gotten around to noticing.But this could happen.A million to one odds, Rick said.But he saw the point.What worried Dave, Bryant continued, is this appearance of the new Nexus 6 advance type.The Rosen organization assured us, as you know, that a Nexus 6 could be delineated by standard profile tests.We took their word for it.Now were forced, as we knew we would be, to determine it on our own.Thats what youll be doing in Seattle.You understand, dont you that this could go wrong either way.If you cant pick out all the humanoid robots, then we have no reliable analytical tool and well never find the ones whore already escaping.If your scale factors out a human subject, identifies him as android Bryant beamed at him icily.It would be awkward, although no one, absolutely not the Rosen people, will make the news public.Actually well be able to sit on it indefinitely, although of course well have to inform W. P. O.  and they in turn will notify Leningrad.Eventually itll pop out of the papes at us.But by then we may have developed a better scale.He picked the phone up.You want to get started?Use a department car and fuel yourself at our pumps.Standing, Rick said, Can I take Dave Holdens notes with me?I want to read them along the way.Bryant said, Lets wait until youve tried out your scale in Seattle.His tone was interestingly merciless, and Rick Deckard noted it.When he landed the police department hovercar on the roof of the Rosen Association Building in Seattle he found a young woman waiting for him.Black haired and slender, wearing the new huge dust filtering glasses, she approached his car, her hands deep in the pockets of her brightly striped long coat.She had, on her sharply defined small face, an expression of sullen distaste.Whats the matter?Rick said as he stepped from the parked car.The girl said, obliquely, Oh, I dont know.Something about the way we got talked to on the phone.It doesnt matter.Abruptly she held out her hand; he reflexively took it.Im Rachael Rosen.I guess youre Mr.Deckard.This is not my idea, he said.Yes, Inspector Bryant told us that.But youre officially the San Francisco Police Department, and it doesnt believe our unit is to the public benefit.She eyed him from beneath long black lashes, probably artificial.Rick said, A humanoid robot is like any other machine; it can fluctuate between being a benefit and a hazard very rapidly.As a benefit its not our problem.But as a hazard, Rachael Rosen said, then you come in.Is it true, Mr.Deckard, that youre a bounty hunter?He shrugged, with reluctance, nodded.You have no difficulty viewing an android as inert, the girl said.So you can retire it, as they say.Do you have the group selected out for me?he said.Id like to He broke off.Because, all at once, he had seen their animals.A powerful corporation, he realized, would of course be able to afford this.In the back of his mind, evidently, he had anticipated such a collection; it was not surprise that he felt but more a sort of yearning.He quietly walked away from the girl, toward the closest pen.Already he could smell them, the several scents of the creatures standing or sitting, or, in the case of what appeared to be a raccoon, asleep.Never in his life had he personally seen a raccoon.He knew the animal only from 3 D films shown on television.For some reason the dust had struck that species almost as hard as it had the birdsof which almost none survived, now.In an automatic response he brought out his muchthumbed Sidneys and looked up raccoon with all the sublistings.The list prices, naturally, appeared in italics; like Percheron horses, none existed on the market for sale at any figure.Sidneys catalogue simply listed the price at which the last transaction involving a raccoon had taken place.It was astronomical.His name is Bill, the girl said from behind him.Bill the raccoon.We acquired him just last year from a subsidiary corporation.She pointed past him and he then perceived the armed company guards, standing with their machine guns, the rapid fire little light Skoda issue; the eyes of the guards had been fastened on him since his car landed.And, he thought, my car is clearly marked as a police vehicle.A major manufacturer of androids, he said thoughtfully, invests its surplus capital on living animals.Look at the owl, Rachael Rosen said.Here, Ill wake it up for you.She started toward a small, distant cage, in the center of which jutted up a branching dead tree.There are no owls, he started to say.Or so weve been told.Sidneys, he thought; they list it in their catalogue as extinct: the tiny, precise type, the E, again and again throughout the catalogue.As the girl walked ahead of him he checked to see, and he was right.Sidneys never makes a mistake, he said to himself.We know that, too.What else can we depend on?Its artificial, he said, with sudden realization; his disappointment welled up keen and intense.No.She smiled and he saw that she had small even teeth, as white as her eyes and hair were black.But Sidneys listing, he said, trying to show her the catalogue.To prove it to her.The girl said, We dont buy from Sidneys or from any animal dealer.All our purchases are from private parties and the prices we pay arent reported.She added, Also we have our own naturalists; theyre now working up in Canada.Theres still a good deal of forest left, comparatively speaking, anyhow.Enough for small animals and once in a while a bird.For a long time he stood gazing at the owl, who dozed on its perch.A thousand thoughts came into his mind, thoughts about the war, about the days when owls had fallen from the sky; he remembered how in his childhood it had been discovered that species upon species had become extinct and how the papes had reported it each dayfoxes one morning, badgers the next, until people had stopped reading the perpetual animal obits.He thought, too, about his need for a real animal; within him an actual hatred once more manifested itself toward his electric sheep, which he had to tend, had to care about, as if it lived.The tyranny of an object, he thought.It doesnt know I exist.Like the androids, it had no ability to appreciate the existence of another.He had never thought of this before, the similarity between an electric animal and an andy.The electric animal, he pondered, could be considered a subform of the other, a kind of vastly inferior robot.Or, conversely, the android could be regarded as a highly developed, evolved version of the ersatz animal.Both viewpoints repelled him.If you sold your owl, he said to the girl Rachael Rosen, how much would you want for it, and how much of that down?We would never sell our owl.She scrutinized him with a mixture of pleasure and pity; or so he read her expression.And even if we sold it, you couldnt possibly pay the price.What kind of animal do you have at home?A sheep, he said.A black faced Suffolk ewe.Well, then you should be happy.Im happy, he answered.Its just that I always wanted an owl, even back before they all dropped dead.He corrected himself.All but yours.Rachael said, Our present crash program and overall planning call for us to obtain an additional owl which can nate with Scrappy.She indicated the owl dozing on its perch; it had briefly opened both eyes, yellow slits which healed over as the owl settled back down to resume its slumber.Its chest rose conspicuously and fell, as if the owl, in its hypnagogic state, had sighed.Breaking away from the sightk made absolute bitterness blend throughout his prior reaction of awe and yearninghe said, Id like to test out the selection, now.Can we go downstairs?My uncle took the call from your superior and by now he probably has  Youre a family?Rick broke in.A corporation this large is a family affair?Continuing her sentence, Rachael said, Uncle Eldon should have an android group and a control group set up by now.So lets go.She strode toward the elevator, hands again thrust violently in the pockets of her coat; she did not look back, and he hesitated for a moment, feeling annoyance, before he at last trailed after her.What have you got against me?he asked her as together they descended.She reflected, as if up to now she hadnt known.Well, she said, you, a little police department employee, are in a unique position.Know what I mean?She gave him a malice filled sidelong glance.How much of your current output, he asked, consists of types equipped with the Nexus 6?All, Rachael said.Im sure the Voigt Kampff scale will work with them.And if it doesnt well have to withdraw all Nexus 6 types from the market.Her black eyes flamed up; she glowered at him as the elevator ceased descending and its doors slid back.Because you police departments cant do an adequate job in the simple matter of detecting the minuscule number of Nexus 6s who balk  A man, dapper and lean and elderly, approached them, hand extended; on his face a harried expression showed, as if everything recently had begun happening too fast.Im Eldon Rosen, he explained to Rick as they shook hands.Listen, Deckard; you realize we dont manufacture anything here on Earth, right?We cant just phone down to production and ask for a diverse flock of items; its not that we dont want or intend to cooperate with you.Anyhow Ive done the best I can.His left hand, shakily, roved through his thinning hair.Indicating his department briefcase, Rick said, Im ready to start.The senior Rosens nervousness buoyed up his own confidence.Theyre afraid of me, he realized with a start.Rachael Rosen included.I can probably force them to abandon manufacture of their Nexus 6 types; what I do during the next hour will affect the structure of their operation.It could conceivably determine the future of the Rosen Association, here in the United States, in Russia, and on Mars.The two members of the Rosen family studied him apprehensively and he felt the hollowness of their manner; by coming here he had brought the void to them, had ushered in emptiness and the hush of economic death.They control inordinate power, he thought.This enterprise is considered one of the systems industrial pivots; the manufacture of androids, in fact, has become so linked to the colonization effort that if one dropped into ruin, so would the other in time.The Rosen Association, naturally, understood this perfectly.Eldon Rosen had obviously been conscious of it since Harry Bryants call.I wouldnt worry if I were you, Rick said as the two Rosens led him down a highly illuminated wide corridor.He himself felt quietly content.This moment, more than any other which he could remember, pleased him.Well, they would all soon know what his testing apparatus could accomplishand could not.If you have no confidence in the Voigt Kampff scale, he pointed out, possibly your organization should have researched an alternate test.It can be argued that the responsibility rests partly on you.Oh, thanks.The Rosens had steered him from the corridor and into a chic, living roomish cubicle furnished with carpeting, lamps, couch, and modern little endtables on which rested recent magazines  including, he noticed, the February supplement to the Sidneys catalogue, which he personally had not seen.In fact, the February supplement wouldnt be out for another three days.Obviously the Rosen Association had a special relationship with Sidneys.Annoyed, he picked up the supplement.This is a violation of public trust.Nobody should get advance news of price changes.As a matter of fact this might violate a federal statute; he tried to remember the relevant law, found he could not.Im taking this with me, he said, and, opening his briefcase, dropped the supplement within.After an interval of silence, Eldon Rosen said wearily, Look, officer, it hasnt been our policy to solicit advance  Im not a peace officer, Rick said.Im a bounty hunter.From his opened briefcase he fished out the Voigt Kampff apparatus, seated himself at a nearby rosewood coffee table, and began to assemble the rather simple polygraphic instruments.You may send the first testee in, he informed Eldon Rosen, who now looked more haggard than ever.Id like to watch, Rachael said, also seating herself.Ive never seen an empathy test being administered.What do those things you have there measure?Rick said, Thishe held up the flat adhesive disk with its trailing wiresmeasures capillary dilation in the facial area.We know this to be a primary autonomic response, the socalled shame or blushing reaction to a morally shocking stimulus.It cant be controlled voluntarily, as can skin conductivity, respiration, and cardiac rate.He showed her the other instrument, a pencil beam light.This records fluctuations of tension within the eye muscles.Simultaneous with the blush phenomenon there generally can be found a small but detectable movement of  And these cant be found in androids, Rachael said.Theyre not engendered by the stimuli questions; no.Although biologically they exist.Potentially.Rachael said, Give me the test.Why?Rick said, puzzled.Speaking up, Eldon Rosen said hoarsely, We selected her as your first subject.She may be an android.Were hoping you can tell.He seated himself in a series of clumsy motions, got out a cigarette, lit it and fixedly watched.5  The small beam of white light shone steadily into the left eye of Rachael Rosen, and against her cheek the wire mesh disk adhered.She seemed calm.Seated where he could catch the readings on the two gauges of the Voigt Kampff testing apparatus, Rick Deckard said, Im going to outline a number of social situations.You are to express your reaction to each as quickly as possible.You will be timed, of course.And of course, Rachael said distantly, my verbal responses wont count.Its solely the eye muscle and capillary reaction that youll use as indices.But Ill answer; I want to go through this and She broke off.Go ahead, Mr.Deckard.Rick, selecting question three, said, You are given a calfskin wallet on your birthday.Both gauges immediately registered past the green and onto the red; the needles swung violently and then subsided.I wouldnt accept it, Rachael said.Also Id report the person who gave it to me to the police.After making a jot of notation Rick continued, turning to the eighth question of the Voigt Kampff profile scale.You have a little boy and he shows you his butterfly collection, including his killing jar.Id take him to the doctor.Rachaels voice was low but firm.Again the twin gauges registered, but this time not so far.He made a note of that, too.Youre sitting watching TV, he continued, and suddenly you discover a wasp crawling on your wrist.Rachael said, Id kill it.The gauges, this time, registered almost nothing: only a feeble and momentary tremor.He noted that and hunted cautiously for the next question.In a magazine you come across a full page color picture of a nude girl.He paused.Is this testing whether Im an android, Rachael asked tartly, or whether Im homosexual?The gauges did not register.He continued, Your husband likes the picture.Still the gauges failed to indicate a reaction.The girl, he added, is lying face down on a large and beautiful bearskin rug.The gauges remained inert, and he said to himself, An android response.Failing to detect the major element, the dead animal pelt.Heritsmind is concentrating on other factors.Your husband hangs the picture up on the wall of his study, he finished, and this time the needles moved.I certainly wouldnt let him, Rachael said.Okay, he said, nodding.Now consider this.Youre reading a novel written in the old days before the war.The characters are visiting Fishermans Wharf in San Francisco.They become hungry and enter a seafood restaurant.One of them orders lobster, and the chef drops the lobster into the tub of boiling water while the characters watch.Oh god, Rachael said.Thats awful!Did they really do that?Its depraved!You mean a live lobster?The gauges, however, did not respond.Formally, a correct response.But simulated.You rent a mountain cabin, he said, in an area still verdant.Its rustic knotty pine with a huge fireplace.Yes, Rachael said, nodding impatiently.On the walls someone has hung old maps, Currier and Ives prints, and above the fireplace a deers head has been mounted, a full stag with developed horns.The people with you admire the decor of the cabin and you all decide  Not with the deer head, Rachael said.The gauges, however, showed an amplitude within the green only.You become pregnant, Rick continued, by a man who has promised to marry you.The man goes off with another woman, your best friend; you get an abortion and  I would never get an abortion, Rachael said.Anyhow you cant.Its a life sentence and the police are always watching.This time both needles swung violently into the red.How do you know that?Rick asked her, curiously.About the difficulty of obtaining an abortion?Everybody knows that, Rachael answered.It sounded like you spoke from personal experience.He watched the needles intently; they still swept out a wide path across the dials.One more.Youre dating a man and he asks you to visit his apartment.While youre there he offers you a drink.As you stand holding your glass you see into the bedroom; its attractively decorated with bullfight posters, and you wander in to look closer.He follows after you, closing the door.Putting his arm around you, he says  Rachael interrupted, Whats a bullfight poster?Drawings, usually in color and very large, showing a matador with his cape, a bull trying to gore him.He was puzzled.How old are you?he asked; that might be a factor.Im eighteen, Rachael said.Okay; so this man closes the door and puts his arm around me.What does he say?Rick said, Do you know how bullfights ended;  I suppose somebody got hurt.The bull at the end, was always killed.He waited, watching the two needles.They palpitated restlessly, nothing more.No real reading at all.A final question, he said.Two part.You are watching an old movie on TV, a movie from before the war.It shows a banquet in progress; the guests are enjoying raw oysters.Ugh, Rachael said; the needles swung swiftly.The entree, he continued, consists of boiled dog, stuffed with rice.The needles moved less this time, less than they had for the raw oysters.Are raw oysters more acceptable to you than a dish of boiled dog?Evidently not.He put his pencil down, shut off the beam of light, removed the adhesive patch from her check.Youre an android, he said.Thats the conclusion of the testing, he informed heror rather itand Eldon Rosen, who regarded him with writhing worry; the elderly mans face contorted, shifted plastically with angry concern.Im right, arent I?Rick said.There was no answer, from either of the Rosens.Look, he said reasonably.We have no conflict of interest; its important to me that the Voigt Kampff test functions, almost as important as it is to you.The elder Rosen said, Shes not an android.I dont believe it, Rick said.Why would he lie?Rachael said to Rick fiercely.If anything, wed lie the other way.I want a bone marrow analysis made of you, Rick said to her.It can eventually be organically determined whether youre android or not; its slow and painful, admittedly, but  Legally, Rachael said, I cant be forced to undergo a bone marrow test.Thats been established in the courts; self incrimination.And anyhow on a live personnot the corpse of a retired androidit takes a long time.You can give that damn Voigt Kampff profile test because of the specials; they have to be tested for constantly, and while the government was doing that you police agencies slipped the Voigt Kampff through.But what you said is true; thats the end of the testing.She rose to her feet, paced away from him, and stood with her hands on her hips, her back to him.The issue is not the legality of the bone marrow analysis, Eldon Rosen said huskily.The issue is that your empathy delineation test failed in response to my niece.I can explain why she scored as an android might.Rachael grew up aboard Salander 3.She was born on it; she spent fourteen of her eighteen years living off its tape library and what the nine other crew members, all adults, knew about Earth.Then, as you know, the ship turned back a sixth of the way to Proxima.Otherwise Rachael would never have seen Earthanyhow not until her later life.You would have retired me, Rachael said over her shoulder.In a police dragnet I would have been killed.Ive known that since I got here four years ago; this isnt the first time the Voigt Kampff test has been given to me.In fact I rarely leave this building; the risk is enormous, because of those roadblocks you police set up, those flying wedge spot checks to pick up unclassified specials.And androids, Eldon Rosen added.Although naturally the public isnt told that; theyre not supposed to know that androids are on Earth, in our midst.I dont think they are, Rick said.I think the various police agencies here and in the Soviet Union have gotten them all.The population is small enough now; everyone, sooner or later, runs into a random checkpoint.That, anyhow, was the idea.What were your instructions, Eldon Rosen asked, if you wound up designating a human as android?Thats a departmental matter.He began restoring his testing gear to his briefcase; the two Rosens watched silently.Obviously, he added, I was told to cancel further testing, as Im now doing.If it failed once theres no point in going on.He snapped the briefcase shut.We could have defrauded you, Rachael said.Nothing forced us to admit you mistested me.And the same for the other nine subjects weve selected.She gestured vigorously.All we had to do was simply go along with your test results, either way.Rick said, I would have insisted on a list in advance.A sealed envelope breakdown.And compared my own test results for congruity.There would have had to be congruity.And I can see now, he realized, that I wouldnt have gotten it.Bryant was right.Thank god I didnt go out bounty hunting on the basis of this test.Yes, I suppose you would have done that, Eldon Rosen said.He glanced at Rachael, who nodded.We discussed that possibility, Eldon said, then, with reluctance.This problem, Rick said, stems entirely from your method of operation, Mr.Rosen.Nobody forced your organization to evolve the production of humanoid robots to a point where  We produced what the colonists wanted, Eldon Rosen said.We followed the time honored principle underlying every commercial venture.If our firm hadnt made these progressively more human types, other firms in the field would have.We knew the risk we were taking when we developed the Nexus 6 brain unit.But your Voigt Kampff test was a failure before we released that type of android.If you had failed to classify a Nexus 6 android as an android, if you had checked it out as humanbut thats not what happened.His voice had become hard and bitingly penetrating.Your police departmentothers as wellmay have retired, very probably have retired, authentic humans with underdeveloped empathic ability, such as my innocent niece here.Your position, Mr.Deckard, is extremely bad morally.Ours isnt.In other words, Rick said with acuity, Im not going to be given a chance to check out a single Nexus 6.You people dropped this schizoid girl on me beforehand.And my test, he realized, is wiped out.I shouldnt have gone for it, he said to himself.However, its too late now.We have you, Mr.Deckard, Rachael Rosen agreed in a quiet, reasonable voice; she turned toward him, then, and smiled.He could not make out, even now, how the Rosen Association had managed to snare him, and so easily.Experts, he realized.A mammoth corporation like thisit embodies too much experience.It possesses in fact a sort of group mind.And Eldon and Rachael Rosen consisted of spokesmen for that corporate entity.His mistake, evidently, had been in viewing them as individuals.It was a mistake he would not make again.Your superior Mr.Bryant, Eldon Rosen said, will have difficulty understanding how you happened to let us void your testing apparatus before the test began.He pointed toward the ceiling, and Rick saw the camera lens.His massive error in dealing with the Rosens had been recorded.I think the right thing for us all to do, Eldon said, is sit down and He gestured affably.We can work something out, Mr.Deckard.Theres no need for anxiety.The Nexus 6 variety of android is a fact; we here at the Rosen Association recognize it and I think now you do, too.Rachael, leaning toward Rick, said, How would you like to own an owl?I doubt if Ill ever own an owl.But he knew what she meant; he understood the business the Rosen Association wanted to transact.Tension of a kind he had never felt before manifested itself inside him; it exploded, leisurely, in every part of his body.He felt the tension, the consciousness of what was happening, take over completely.But an owl, Eldon Rosen said, is the thing you want.He glanced at his niece inquiringly.I dont think he has any idea  Of course he does, Rachael contradicted.He knows exactly where this is heading.Dont you, Mr.Deckard?Again she leaned toward him, and this time closer; he could smell a mild perfume about her, almost a warmth.Youre practically there, Mr.Deckard.You practically have your owl.To Eldon Rosen she said, Hes a bounty hunter; remember?So he lives off the bounty he makes, not his salary.Isnt that so, Mr.Deckard?He nodded.How many androids escaped this time?Rachael inquired.Presently he said, Eight.Originally.Two have already been retired, by someone else; not me.You get how much for each android?Rachael asked.Shrugging, he said, It varies.Rachael said, If you have no test you can administer, then there is no way you can identify an android.And if theres no way you can identify an android theres no way you can collect your bounty.So if the Voigt Kampff scale has to be abandoned  A new scale, Rick said, will replace it.This has happened before.Three times, to be exact.But the new scale, the more modern analytical device, had been there already; no lag had existed.This time was different.Eventually, of course, the Voigt Kampff scale will become obsolete, Rachael agreed.But not now.Were satisfied ourselves that it will delineate the Nexus 6 types and wed like you to proceed on that basis in your own particular, peculiar work.Rocking back and forth, her arms tightly folded, she regarded him with intensity.Trying to fathom his reaction.Tell him he can have his owl, Eldon Rosen grated.You can have the owl, Rachael said, still eyeing him.The one up on the roof.Scrappy.But we will want to mate it if we can get our hands on a male.And any offspring will be ours; that has to be absolutely understood.Rick said, Ill divide the brood.No, Rachael said instantly; behind her Eldon Rosen shook his head, backing her up.That way youd have claim to the sole bloodline of owls for the rest of eternity.And theres another condition.You cant will your owl to anybody; at your death it reverts back to the association.That sounds, Rick said, like an invitation for you to come in and kill me.To get your owl back immediately.I wont agree to that; its too dangerous.Youre a bounty hunter, Rachael said.You can handle a laser gunin fact youre carrying one right now.If you cant protect yourself, how are you going to retire the six remaining Nexus 6 andys?Theyre a good deal smarter than the Grozzi Corporations old W 4.But I hunt them, he said.This way, with a reversion clause on the owl, someone would be hunting me.And he did not like the idea of being stalked; he had seen the effect on androids.It brought about certain notable changes, even in them.Rachael said, All right; well yield on that.You can will the owl to your heirs.But we insist on getting the complete brood.If you cant agree to that, go on back to San Francisco and admit to your superiors in the department that the Voigt Kampff scale, at least as administered by you, cant distinguish an andy from a human being.And then look for another job.Give me some time, Rick said.Okay, Rachael said.Well leave you in here, where its comfortable.She examined her wristwatch.Half an hour, Eldon Rosen said.He and Rachael filed toward the door of the room, silently.They had said what they intended to say, he realized; the rest lay in his lap.As Rachael started to close the door after herself and her uncle, Rick said starkly, You managed to set me up perfectly.You have it on tape that I missed on you; you know that my job depends on the use of the Voigt Kampff scale; and you own that goddamn owl.Your owl, dear, Rachael said.Remember?Well tie your home address around its leg and have it fly down to San Francisco; itll meet you there when you get off work.It, he thought.She keeps calling the owl it.Not her.Just a second, he said.Pausing at the door, Rachael said, Youve decided?I want, he said, opening his briefcase, to ask you one more question from the Voigt Kampff scale.Sit down again.Rachael glanced at her uncle; he nodded and she grudgingly returned, seating herself as before.Whats this for?she demanded, her eyebrows lifted in distasteand wariness.He perceived her skeletal tension, noted it professionally.Presently he had the pencil of light trained on her right eye and the adhesive patch again in contact with her check.Rachael stared into the light rigidly, the expression of extreme distaste still manifest.My briefcase, Rick said as he rummaged for the Voigt Kampff forms.Nice, isnt it?Department issue.Well, well, Rachael said remotely.Babyhide, Rick said.He stroked the black leather surface of the briefcase.One hundred percent genuine human babyhide.He saw the two dial indicators gyrate frantically.But only after a pause.
