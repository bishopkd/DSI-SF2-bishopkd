1  The Deliverator belongs to an elite order, a hallowed subcategory.He's got esprit up to here.Right now, he is preparing to carry out his third mission of the night.His uniform is black as activated charcoal, filtering the very light out of the air.A bullet will bounce off its arachnofiber weave like a wren hitting a patio door, but excess perspiration wafts through it like a breeze through a freshly napalmed forest.Where his body has bony extremities, the suit has sintered armorgel: feels like gritty jello, protects like a stack of telephone books.When they gave him the job, they gave him a gun.The Deliverator never deals in cash, but someone might come after him anywaymight want his car, or his cargo.The gun is tiny, aero styled, lightweight, the kind of a gun a fashion designer would carry; it fires teensy darts that fly at five times the velocity of an SR 71 spy plane, and when you get done using it, you have to plug it into the cigarette lighter, because it runs on electricity.The Deliverator never pulled that gun in anger, or in fear.He pulled it once in Gila Highlands.Some punks in Gila Highlands, a fancy Burbclave, wanted themselves a delivery, and they didn't want to pay for it.Thought they would impress the Deliverator with a baseball bat.The Deliverator took out his gun, centered its laser doo hickey on that poised Louisville Slugger, fired it.The recoil was immense, as though the weapon had blown up in his hand.The middle third of the baseball bat turned into a column of burning sawdust accelerating in all directions like a bursting star.Punk ended up holding this bat handle with milky smoke pouring out the end.Stupid look on his face.Didn't get nothing but trouble from the Deliverator.Since then the Deliverator has kept the gun in the glove compartment and relied, instead, on a matched set of samurai swords, which have always been his weapon of choice anyhow.The punks in Gila Highlands weren't afraid of the gun, so the Deliverator was forced to use it.But swords need no demonstrations.The Deliverator's car has enough potential energy packed into its batteries to fire a pound of bacon into the Asteroid Belt.Unlike a bimbo box or a Burb beater, the Deliverator's car unloads that power through gaping, gleaming, polished sphincters.When the Deliverator puts the hammer down, shit happens.You want to talk contact patches?Your car's tires have tiny contact patches, talk to the asphalt in four places the size of your tongue.The Deliverator's car has big sticky tires with contact patches the size of a fat lady's thighs.The Deliverator is in touch with the road, starts like a bad day, stops on a peseta.Why is the Deliverator so equipped?Because people rely on him.He is a roll model.This is America.People do whatever the fuck they feel like doing, you got a problem with that?Because they have a right to.And because they have guns and no one can fucking stop them.As a result, this country has one of the worst economies in the world.When it gets down to ittalking trade balances hereonce we've brain drained all our technology into other countries, once things have evened out, they're making cars in Bolivia and microwave ovens in Tadzhikistan and selling them hereonce our edge in natural resources has been made irrelevant by giant Hong Kong ships and dirigibles that can ship North Dakota all the way to New Zealand for a nickelonce the Invisible Hand has taken all those historical inequities and smeared them out into a broad global layer of what a Pakistani brickmaker would consider to be prosperityy'know what?There's only four things we do better than anyone else    music  movies  microcode (software)  high speed pizza delivery    The Deliverator used to make software.Still does, sometimes.But if life were a mellow elementary school run by well meaning education Ph.D. s, the Deliverator's report card would say: Hiro is so bright and creative but needs to work harder on his cooperation skills.So now he has this other job.No brightness or creativity involvedbut no cooperation either.Just a single principle: The Deliverator stands tall, your pie in thirty minutes or you can have it free, shoot the driver, take his car, file a class action suit.The Deliverator has been working this job for six months, a rich and lengthy tenure by his standards, and has never delivered a pizza in more than twenty one minutes.Oh, they used to argue over times, many corporate driver years lost to it: homeowners, red faced and sweaty with their own lies, stinking of Old Spice and job related stress, standing in their glowing yellow doorways brandishing their Seikos and waving at the clock over the kitchen sink, I swear, can't you guys tell time?Didn't happen anymore.Pizza delivery is a major industry.A managed industry.People went to CosaNostra Pizza University four years just to learn it.Came in its doors unable to write an English sentence, from Abkhazia, Rwanda, Guanajuato, South Jersey, and came out knowing more about pizza than a Bedouin knows about sand.And they had studied this problem.Graphed the frequency of doorway delivery time disputes.Wired the early Deliverators to record, then analyze, the debating tactics, the voice stress histograms, the distinctive grammatical structures employed by white middle class Type A Burbclave occupants who against all logic had decided that this was the place to take their personal Custerian stand against all that was stale and deadening in their lives: they were going to lie, or delude themselves, about the time of their phone call and get themselves a free pizza; no, they deserved a free pizza along with their life, liberty, and pursuit of whatever, it was fucking inalienable.Sent psychologists out to these people's houses, gave them a free TV set to submit to an anonymous interview, hooked them to polygraphs, studied their brain waves as they showed them choppy, inexplicable movies of porn queens and late night car crashes and Sammy Davis, Jr., put them in sweet smelling, mauve walled rooms and asked them questions about Ethics so perplexing that even a Jesuit couldn't respond without committing a venial sin.The analysts at CosaNostra Pizza University concluded that it was just human nature and you couldn't fix it, and so they went for a quick cheap technical fix: smart boxes.The pizza box is a plastic carapace now, corrugated for stiffness, a little LED readout glowing on the side, telling the Deliverator how many trade imbalance producing minutes have ticked away since the fateful phone call.There are chips and stuff in there.The pizzas rest, a short stack of them, in slots behind the Deliverator's head.Each pizza glides into a slot like a circuit board into a computer, clicks into place as the smart box interfaces with the onboard system of the Deliverator's car.The address of the caller has already been inferred from his phone number and poured into the smart box's built in RAM.From there it is communicated to the car, which computes and projects the optimal route on a heads up display, a glowing colored map traced out against the windshield so that the Deliverator does not even have to glance down.If the thirty minute deadline expires, news of the disaster is flashed to CosaNostra Pizza Headquarters and relayed from there to Uncle Enzo himselfthe Sicilian Colonel Sanders, the Andy Griffith of Bensonhurst, the straight razor swinging figment of many a Deliverator's nightmares, the Capo and prime figurehead of CosaNostra Pizza, Incorporatedwho will be on the phone to the customer within five minutes, apologizing profusely.The next day, Uncle Enzo will land on the customer's yard in a jet helicopter and apologize some more and give him a free trip to Italyall he has to do is sign a bunch of releases that make him a public figure and spokesperson for CosaNostra Pizza and basically end his private life as he knows it.He will come away from the whole thing feeling that, somehow, he owes the Mafia a favor.The Deliverator does not know for sure what happens to the driver in such cases, but he has heard some rumors.Most pizza deliveries happen in the evening hours, which Uncle Enzo considers to be his private time.And how would you feel if you had to interrupt dinner with your family in order to call some obstreperous dork in a Burbclave and grovel for a late fucking pizza?Uncle Enzo has not put in fifty years serving his family and his country so that, at the age when most are playing golf and bobbling their granddaughters, he can get out of the bathtub dripping wet and lie down and kiss the feet of some sixteen year old skate punk whose pepperoni was thirty one minutes in coming.Oh, God.It makes the Deliverator breathe a little shallower just to think of the idea.But he wouldn't drive for CosaNostra Pizza any other way.You know why?Because there's something about having your life on the line.It's like being a kamikaze pilot.Your mind is clear.Other peoplestore clerks, burger flippers, software engineers, the whole vocabulary of meaningless jobs that make up Life in Americaother people just rely on plain old competition.Better flip your burgers or debug your subroutines faster and better than your high school classmate two blocks down the strip is flipping or debugging, because we're in competition with those guys, and people notice these things.What a fucking rat race that is.CosaNostra Pizza doesn't have any competition.Competition goes against the Mafia ethic.You don't work harder because you're competing against some identical operation down the street.You work harder because everything is on the line.Your name, your honor, your family, your life.Those burger flippers might have a better life expectancybut what kind of life is it anyway, you have to ask yourself.That's why nobody, not even the Nipponese, can move pizzas faster than CosaNostra.The Deliverator is proud to wear the uniform, proud to drive the car, proud to march up the front walks of innumerable Burbclave homes, a grim vision in ninja black, a pizza on his shoulder, red LED digits blazing proud numbers into the night: 12:32 or 15:15 or the occasional 20:43.The Deliverator is assigned to CosaNostra Pizza #3569 in the Valley.Southern California doesn't know whether to bustle or just strangle itself on the spot.Not enough roads for the number of people.Fairlanes, Inc.is laying new ones all the time.Have to bulldoze lots of neighborhoods to do it, but those seventies and eighties developments exist to be bulldozed, right?No sidewalks, no schools, no nothing.Don't have their own police forceno immigration controlundesirables can walk right in without being frisked or even harassed.Now a Burbclave, that's the place to live.A city state with its own constitution, a border, laws, cops, everything.The Deliverator was a corporal in the Farms of Merryvale State Security Force for a while once.Got himself fired for pulling a sword on an acknowledged perp.Slid it right through the fabric of the perp's shirt, gliding the flat of the blade along the base of his neck, and pinned him to a warped and bubbled expanse of vinyl siding on the wall of the house that the perp was trying to break into.Thought it was a pretty righteous bust.But they fired him anyway because the perp turned out to be the son of the vice chancellor of the Farms of Merryvale.Oh, the weasels had an excuse: said that a thirty six inch samurai sword was not on their Weapons Protocol.Said that he had violated the SPAC, the Suspected Perpetrator Apprehension Code.Said that the perp had suffered psychological trauma.He was afraid of butter knives now; he had to spread his jelly with the back of a teaspoon.They said that he had exposed them to liability.The Deliverator had to borrow some money to pay for it.Had to borrow it from the Mafia, in fact.So he's in their database nowretinal patterns, DNA, voice graph, fingerprints, footprints, palm prints, wrist prints, every fucking part of the body that had wrinkles on italmostthose bastards rolled in ink and made a print and digitized it into their computer.But it's their moneysure they're careful about loaning it out.And when he applied for the Deliverator job they were happy to take him, because they knew him.When he got the loan, he had to deal personally with the assistant vice capo of the Valley, who later recommended him for the Deliverator job.So it was like being in a family.A really scary, twisted, abusive family.CosaNostra Pizza #3569 is on Vista Road just down from Kings Park Mall.Vista Road used to belong to the State of California and now is called Fairlanes, Inc.Rte.CSV 5.Its main competition used to be a U. S.  highway and is now called Cruiseways, Inc.Rte.Cal 12.Farther up the Valley, the two competing highways actually cross.Once there had been bitter disputes, the intersection closed by sporadic sniper fire.Finally, a big developer bought the entire intersection and turned it into a drive through mall.Now the roads just feed into a parking systemnot a lot, not a ramp, but a systemand lose their identity.Getting through the intersection involves tracing paths through the parking system, many braided filaments of direction like the Ho Chi Minh trail.CSV 5 has better throughput, but Cal 12 has better pavement.That is typicalFairlanes roads emphasize getting you there, for Type A drivers, and Cruiseways emphasize the enjoyment of the ride, for Type B drivers.The Deliverator is a Type A driver with rabies.He is zeroing in on his home base, CosaNostra Pizza #3569, cranking up the left lane of CSV 5 at a hundred and twenty kilometers.His car is an invisible black lozenge, just a dark place that reflects the tunnel of franchise signsthe loglo.A row of orange lights burbles and churns across the front, where the grille would be if this were an air breathing car.The orange light looks like a gasoline fire.It comes in through people's rear windows, bounces off their rearview mirrors, projects a fiery mask across their eyes, reaches into their subconscious, and unearths terrible fears of being pinned, fully conscious, under a detonating gas tank, makes them want to pull over and let the Deliverator overtake them in his black chariot of pepperoni fire.The loglo, overhead, marking out CSV 5 in twin contrails, is a body of electrical light made of innumerable cells, each cell designed in Manhattan by imageers who make more for designing a single logo than a Deliverator will make in his entire lifetime.Despite their efforts to stand out, they all smear together, especially at a hundred and twenty kilometers per hour.Still, it is easy to see CosaNostra Pizza #3569 because of the billboard, which is wide and tall even by current inflated standards.In fact, the squat franchise itself looks like nothing more than a low slung base for the great aramid fiber pillars that thrust the billboard up into the trademark firmament.Marca Registrada, baby.The billboard is a classic, a chestnut, not a figment of some fleeting Mafia promotional campaign.It is a statement, a monument built to endure.Simple and dignified.It shows Uncle Enzo in one of his spiffy Italian suits.The pinstripes glint and flex like sinews.The pocket square is luminous.His hair is perfect, slicked back with something that never comes off, each strand cut off straight and square at the end by Uncle Enzo's cousin, Art the Barber, who runs the second largest chain of low end haircutting establishments in the world.Uncle Enzo is standing there, not exactly smiling, an avuncular glint in his eye for sure, not posing like a model but standing there like your uncle would, and it says    The Mafia  you've got a friend in The Family!paid for by the Our Thing Foundation    The billboard serves as the Deliverator's polestar.He knows that when he gets to the place on CSV 5 where the bottom corner of the billboard is obscured by the pseudo Gothic stained glass arches of the local Reverend Wayne's Pearly Gates franchise, it's time for him to get over into the right lanes where the retards and the bimbo boxes poke along, random, indecisive, looking at each passing franchise's driveway like they don't know if it's a promise or a threat.He cuts off a bimbo boxa family minivanveers past the Buy 'n' Fly that is next door, and pulls into CosaNostra Pizza #3569.Those big fat contact patches complain, squeal a little bit, but they hold on to the patented Fairlanes, Inc.high traction pavement and guide him into the chute.No other Deliverators are waiting in the chute.That is good, that means high turnover for him, fast action, keep moving that 'za.As he scrunches to a stop, the electromechanical hatch on the flank of his car is already opening to reveal his empty pizza slots, the door clicking and folding back in on itself like the wing of a beetle.The slots are waiting.Waiting for hot pizza.And waiting.The Deliverator honks his horn.This is not a nominal outcome.Window slides open.That should never happen.You can look at the three ring binder from CosaNostra Pizza University, cross reference the citation for window, chute, dispatcher's, and it will give you all the procedures for that windowand it should never be opened.Unless something has gone wrong.The window slides open andyou sitting down?smoke comes out of it.The Deliverator hears a discordant beetling over the metal hurricane of his sound system and realizes that it is a smoke alarm, coming from inside the franchise.Mute button on the stereo.Oppressive silencehis eardrums uncringethe window is buzzing with the cry of the smoke alarm.The car idles, waiting.The hatch has been open too long, atmospheric pollutants are congealing on the electrical contacts in the back of the pizza slots, he'll have to clean them ahead of schedule, everything is going exactly the way it shouldn't go in the three ring binder that spells out all the rhythms of the pizza universe.Inside, a football shaped Abkhazian man is running to and fro, holding a three ring binder open, using his spare tire as a ledge to keep it from collapsing shut; he runs with the gait of a man carrying an egg on a spoon.He is shouting in the Abkhazian dialect; all the people who run CosaNostra pizza franchises in this part of the Valley are Abkhazian immigrants.It does not look like a serious fire.The Deliverator saw a real fire once, at the Farms of Merryvale, and you couldn't see anything for the smoke.That's all it was: smoke, burbling out of nowhere, occasional flashes of orange light down at the bottom, like heat lightning in tall clouds.This is not that kind of fire.It is the kind of fire that just barely puts out enough smoke to detonate the smoke alarms.And he is losing time for this shit.The Deliverator holds the horn button down.The Abkhazian manager comes to the window.He is supposed to use the intercom to talk to drivers, he could say anything he wanted and it would be piped straight into the Deliverator's car, but no, he has to talk face to face, like the Deliverator is some kind of fucking ox cart driver.He is red faced, sweating, his eyes roll as he tries to think of the English words.A fire, a little one, he says.The Deliverator says nothing.Because he knows that all of this is going onto videotape.The tape is being pipelined, as it happens, to CosaNostra Pizza University, where it will be analyzed in a pizza management science laboratory.It will be shown to Pizza University students, perhaps to the very students who will replace this man when he gets fired, as a textbook example of how to screw up your life.New employeeput his dinner in the microwavehad foil in itboom!the manager says.Abkhazia had been part of the Soviet fucking Union.A new immigrant from Abkhazia trying to operate a microwave was like a deep sea tube worm doing brain surgery.Where did they get these guys?Weren't there any Americans who could bake a fucking pizza?Just give me one pie, the Deliverator says.Talking about pies snaps the guy into the current century.He gets a grip.He slams the window shut, strangling the relentless keening of the smoke alarm.A Nipponese robot arm shoves the pizza out and into the top slot.The hatch folds shut to protect it.As the Deliverator is pulling out of the chute, building up speed, checking the address that is flashed across his windshield, deciding whether to turn right or left, it happens.His stereo cuts out againon command of the onboard system.The cockpit lights go red.Red.A repetitive buzzer begins to sound.The LED readout on his windshield, which echoes the one on the pizza box, flashes up: 20:00.They have just given the Deliverator a twenty minute old pizza.He checks the address; it is twelve miles away.2  The Deliverator lets out an involuntary roar and puts the hammer down.His emotions tell him to go back and kill that manager, get his swords out of the trunk, dive in through the little sliding window like a ninja, track him down through the moiling chaos of the microwaved franchise and confront him in a climactic thick crust apocalypse.But he thinks the same thing when someone cuts him off on the freeway, and he's never done ityet.He can handle this.This is doable.He cranks up the orange warning lights to maximum brilliance, puts his headlights on autoflash.He overrides the warning buzzer, jams the stereo over to Taxiscan, which cruises all the taxi driver frequencies listening for interesting traffic.Can't understand a fucking word.You could buy tapes, learn while you drive, and learn to speak Taxilinga.It was essential, to get a job in that business.They said it was based on English but not one word in a hundred was recognizable.Still, you could get an idea.If there was trouble on this road, they'd be babbling about it in Taxilinga, give him some warning, let him take an alternate route so he wouldn't get  he grips the wheel  stuck in traffic  his eyes get big, he can feel the pressure driving  them back  into his skull  or caught behind a mobile home  his bladder is very full  and deliver the pizza  Oh, God oh, God  late  22:06 hangs on the windshield; all he can see, all he can think about is 30:01.The taxi drivers are buzzing about something.Taxilinga is mellifluous babble with a few harsh foreign sounds, like butter spiced with broken glass.He keeps hearing fare.They are always jabbering about their fucking fares.Big deal.What happens if you deliver your fare  late  you don't get as much of a tip?Big deal.Big slowdown at the intersection of CSV 5 and Oahu Road, per usual, only way to avoid it is to cut through The Mews at Windsor Heights.TMAWHs all have the same layout.When creating a new Burbclave, TMAWH Development Corporation will chop down any mountain ranges and divert the course of any mighty rivers that threaten to interrupt this street planergonomically designed to encourage driving safety.A Deliverator can go into a Mews at Windsor Heights anywhere from Fairbanks to Yaroslavl to the Shenzhen special economic zone and find his way around.But once you've delivered a pie to every single house in a TMAWH a few times, you get to know its little secrets.The Deliverator is such a man.He knows that in a standard TMAWH there is only one yardone yardthat prevents you from driving straight in one entrance, across the Burbclave, and out the other.If you are squeamish about driving on grass, it might take you ten minutes to meander through TMAWH.But if you have the balls to lay tracks across that one yard, you have a straight shot through the center.The Deliverator knows that yard.He has delivered pizzas there.He has looked at it, scoped it out, memorized the location of the shed and the picnic table, can find them even in the darkknows that if it ever came to this, a twenty three minute pizza, miles to go, and a slowdown at CSV 5 and Oahuhe could enter The Mews at Windsor Heights (his electronic delivery man's visa would raise the gate automatically), scream down Heritage Boulevard, rip the turn onto Strawbridge Place (ignoring the DEAD END sign and the speed limit and the CHILDREN PLAYING ideograms that are strung so liberally throughout TMAWH), thrash the speed bumps with his mighty radials, blast up the driveway of Number 15 Strawbridge Circle, cut a hard left around the backyard shed, careen into the backyard of Number 84 Mayapple Place, avoid its picnic table (tricky), get into their driveway and out onto Mayapple, which takes him to Bellewoode Valley Road, which runs straight to the exit of the Burbclave.TMAWH security police might be waiting for him at the exit, but their STDs, Severe Tire Damage devices, only point one waythey can keep people out, but not keep them in.This car can go so fucking fast that if a cop took a bite of a doughnut as the Deliverator was entering Heritage Boulevard, he probably wouldn't be able to swallow it until about the time the Deliverator was shrieking out onto Oahu.Thunk.And more red lights come up on the windshield: the perimeter security of the Deliverator's vehicle has been breached.No.It can't be.Someone is shadowing him.Right off his left flank.A person on a skateboard, rolling down the highway right behind him, just as he is laying in his approach vectors to Heritage Boulevard.The Deliverator, in his distracted state, has allowed himself to get pooned.As in harpooned.It is a big round padded electromagnet on the end of an arachnofiber cable.It has just thunked onto the back of the Deliverator's car, and stuck.Ten feet behind him, the owner of this cursed device is surfing, taking him for a ride, skateboarding along like a water skier behind a boat.In the rearview, flashes of orange and blue.The parasite is not just a punk out having a good time.It is a businessman making money.The orange and blue coverall, bulging all over with sintered armorgel padding, is the uniform of a Kourier.A Kourier from RadiKS, Radikal Kourier Systems.Like a bicycle messenger, but a hundred times more irritating because they don't pedal under their own powerthey just latch on and slow you down.Naturally.The Deliverator was in a hurry, flashing his lights, squealing his contact patches.The fastest thing on the road.Naturally, the Kourier would choose him to latch onto.No need to get rattled.With the shortcut through TMAWH, he will have plenty of time.He passes a slower car in the middle lane, then cuts right in front of him.The Kourier will have to unpoon or else be slammed sideways into the slower vehicle.Done.The Kourier isn't ten feet behind him anymorehe is right there, peering in the rear window.Anticipating the maneuver, the Kourier reeled in his cord, which is attached to a handle with a power reel in it, and is now right on top of the pizza mobile, the front wheel of his skateboard actually underneath the Deliverator's rear bumper.An orange and blue gloved hand reaches forward, a transparent sheet of plastic draped over it, and slaps his driver's side window.The Deliverator has just been stickered.The sticker is a foot across and reads, in big orange block letters, printed backward so that he can read it from the inside.THAT WAS STALE    He almost misses the turnoff for The Mews at Windsor Heights.He has to jam the brakes, let traffic clear, cut across the curb lane to enter the Burbclave.The border post is well lighted, the customs agents ready to frisk all comerscavity search them if they are the wrong kind of peoplebut the gate flies open as if by magic as the security system senses that this is a CosaNostra Pizza vehicle, just making a delivery, sir.And as he goes through, the Kourierthat tick on his asswaves to the border police!What a prick!Like he comes in here all the time!He probably does come in here all the time.Picking up important shit for important TMAWH people, delivering it to other FOQNEs, Franchise Organized Quasi National Entities, getting it through customs.That's what Kouriers do.Still.He's going too slow, lost all his momentum, his timing is off.Where's the Kourier?Ah, reeled out some line, is following behind again.The Deliverator knows that this jerk is in for a big surprise.Can he stay on his fucking skateboard while he's being hauled over the flattened remains of some kid's plastic tricycle at a hundred kilometers?We're going to find out.The Kourier leans backthe Deliverator can't help watching in the rearviewleans back like a water skier, pushes off against his board, and swings around beside him, now traveling abreast with him up Heritage Boulevard and slap another sticker goes up, this one on the windshield!It says    SMOOTH MOVE, EX LAX    The Deliverator has heard of these stickers.It takes hours to get them off.Have to take the car into a detailing place, pay trillions of dollars.The Deliverator has two things on his agenda now: He is going to shake this street scum, whatever it takes, and deliver the fucking pizza all in the space of    24:23    the next five minutes and thirty seven seconds.This is itgot to pay more attention to the roadhe swings into the side street, no warning, hoping maybe to whipsaw the Kourier into the street sign on the corner.Doesn't work.The smart ones watch your front tires, they see when you're turning, can't surprise them.Down Strawbridge Place!It seems so long, longer than he rememberednatural when you're in a hurry.Sees the glint of cars up ahead, cars parked sideways to the roadthese must be parked in the circle.And there's the house.Light blue vinyl clapboard two story with one story garage to the side.He makes that driveway the center of his universe, puts the Kourier out of his mind, tries not to think about Uncle Enzo, what he's doing right nowin the bath, maybe, or taking a crap, or making love to some actress, or teaching Sicilian songs to one of his twenty six granddaughters.The slope of the driveway slams his front suspension halfway up into the engine compartment, but that's what suspensions are for.He evades the car in the drivewaymust have visitors tonight, didn't remember that these people drove a Lexuscuts through the hedge, into the side yard, looks for that shed, that shed he absolutely must not run into  it's not there, they took it down  next problem, the picnic table in the next yard  hang on, there's a fence, when did they put up a fence?This is no time to put on the brakes.Got to build up some speed, knock it down without blowing all this momentum.It's just a four foot wooden thing.The fence goes down easy, he loses maybe ten percent of his speed.But strangely, it looked like an old fence, maybe he made a wrong turn somewherehe realizes, as he catapults into an empty backyard swimming pool.If it had been full of water, that wouldn't have been so bad, maybe the car would have been saved, he wouldn't owe CosaNostra Pizza a new car.But no, he does a Stuka into the far wall of the pool, it sounds more like an explosion than a crash.The airbag inflates, comes back down a second later like a curtain revealing the structure of his new life: he is stuck in a dead car in an empty pool in a TMAWH, the sirens of the Burbclave's security police are approaching, and there's a pizza behind his head, resting there like the blade of a guillotine, with 25:17 on it.Where's it going?someone says.A woman.He looks up through the distorted frame of the window, now rimmed with a fractal pattern of crystallized safety glass.It is the Kourier talking to him.The Kourier is not a man, it is a young woman.A fucking teenaged girl.She is pristine, unhurt.She has skated right down into the pool, she's now oscillating back and forth from one side of the pool to the other, skating up one bank, almost to the lip, turning around, skating down and across and up the opposite side.She is holding her poon in her right hand, the electromagnet reeled up against the handle so it looks like some kind of a strange wide angle intergalactic death ray.Her chest glitters like a general's with a hundred little ribbons and medals, except each rectangle is not a ribbon, it is a bar code.A bar code with an ID number that gets her into a different business, highway, or FOQNE.Yo!she says.Where's the pizza going?He's going to die and she's gamboling.White Columns.5 Oglethorpe Circle, he says.I can do that.Open the hatch.His heart expands to twice its normal size.Tears come to his eyes.He may live.He presses a button and the hatch opens.On her next orbit across the bottom of the pool, the Kourier yanks the pizza out of its slot.The Deliverator winces, imagining the garlicky topping accordioning into the back wall of the box.Then she puts it sideways under her arm.It's more than a Deliverator can stand to watch.But she'll get it there.Uncle Enzo doesn't have to apologize for ugly, ruined, cold pizzas, just late ones.Hey, he says, take this.The Deliverator sticks his black clad arm out the shattered window.A white rectangle glows in the dim backyard light: a business card.The Kourier snatches it from him on her next orbit, reads it.It says      On the back is gibberish explaining how he may be reached: a telephone number.A universal voice phone locator code.A P. O.  box.His address on half a dozen electronic communications nets.And an address in the Metaverse.Stupid name, she says, shoving the card into one of a hundred little pockets on her coverall.But you'll never forget it, Hiro says.If you're a hacker ...How come I'm delivering pizzas?Right.Because I'm a freelance hacker.Look, whatever your name isI owe you one.Name's Y. T. , she says, shoving at the pool a few times with one foot, building up more energy.She flies out of the pool as if catapulted, and she's gone.The smartwheels of her skateboard, many, many spokes extending and retracting to fit the shape of the ground, take her across the lawn like a pat of butter skidding across hot Teflon.Hiro, who as of thirty seconds ago is no longer the Deliverator, gets out of the car and pulls his swords out of the trunk, straps them around his body, prepares for a breathtaking nighttime escape run across TMAWH territory.The border with Oakwood Estates is only minutes away, he has the layout memorized (sort of), and he knows how these Burbclave cops operate, because he used to be one.So he has a good chance of making it.But it's going to be interesting.Above him, in the house that owns the pool, a light has come on, and children are looking down at him through their bedroom windows, all warm and fuzzy in their Li'l Crips and Ninja Raft Warrior pajamas, which can either be flameproof or noncarcinogenic but not both at the same time.Dad is emerging from the back door, pulling on a jacket.It is a nice family, a safe family in a house full of light, like the family he was a part of until thirty seconds ago.3  Hiro Protagonist and Vitaly Chernobyl, roommates, are chilling out in their home, a spacious 20 by 30 in a U Stor It in Inglewood, California.The room has a concrete slab floor, corrugated steel walls separating it from the neighboring units, andthis is a mark of distinction and luxurya roll up steel door that faces northwest, giving them a few red rays at times like this, when the sun is setting over LAX.From time to time, a 777 or a Sukhoi/Kawasaki Hypersonic Transport will taxi in front of the sun and block the sunset with its rudder, or just mangle the red light with its jet exhaust, braiding the parallel rays into a dappled pattern on the wall.But there are worse places to live.There are much worse places right here in this U Stor It.Only the big units like this one have their own doors.Most of them are accessed via a communal loading dock that leads to a maze of wide corrugated steel hallways and freight elevators.These are slum housing, 5 by 10s and 10 by 10s where Yanoama tribespersons cook beans and parboil fistfuls of coca leaves over heaps of burning lottery tickets.It is whispered that in the old days, when the U Stor It was actually used for its intended purpose (namely, providing cheap extra storage space to Californians with too many material goods), certain entrepreneurs came to the front office, rented out 10 by 10s using fake IDs, filled them up with steel drums full of toxic chemical waste, and then abandoned them, leaving the problem for the U Stor It Corporation to handle.According to these rumors, U Stor It just padlocked those units and wrote them off.Now, the immigrants claim, certain units remain haunted by this chemical specter.It is a story they tell their children, to keep them from trying to break into padlocked units.No one has ever tried to break into Hiro and Vitaly's unit because there's nothing in there to steal, and at this point in their lives, neither one of them is important enough to kill, kidnap, or interrogate.Hiro owns a couple of nice Nipponese swords, but he always wears them, and the whole idea of stealing fantastically dangerous weapons presents the would be perp with inherent dangers and contradictions: When you are wrestling for possession of a sword, the man with the handle always wins.Hiro also has a pretty nice computer that he usually takes with him when he goes anywhere.Vitaly owns half a carton of Lucky Strikes, an electric guitar, and a hangover.At the moment, Vitaly Chernobyl is stretched out on a futon, quiescent, and Hiro Protagonist is sitting cross legged at a low table, Nipponese style, consisting of a cargo pallet set on cinderblocks.As the sun sets, its red light is supplanted by the light of many neon logos emanating from the franchise ghetto that constitutes this U Stor It's natural habitat.This light, known as loglo, fills in the shadowy corners of the unit with seedy, oversaturated colors.Hiro has cappuccino skin and spiky, truncated dreadlocks.His hair does not cover as much of his head as it used to, but he is a young man, by no means bald or balding, and the slight retreat of his hairline only makes more of his high cheekbones.He is wearing shiny goggles that wrap halfway around his head; the bows of the goggles have little earphones that are plugged into his outer ears.The earphones have some built in noise cancellation features.This sort of thing works best on steady noise.When jumbo jets make their takeoff runs on the runway across the street, the sound is reduced to a low doodling hum.But when Vitaly Chernobyl thrashes out an experimental guitar solo, it still hurts Hiro's ears.The goggles throw a light, smoky haze across his eyes and reflect a distorted wide angle view of a brilliantly lit boulevard that stretches off into an infinite blackness.This boulevard does not really exist; it is a computer rendered view of an imaginary place.Beneath this image, it is possible to see Hiro's eyes, which look Asian.They are from his mother, who is Korean by way of Nippon.The rest of him looks more like his father, who was African by way of Texas by way of the Armyback in the days before it got split up into a number of competing organizations such as General Jim's Defense System and Admiral Bob's National Security.Four things are on the cargo pallet: a bottle of expensive beer from the Puget Sound area, which Hiro cannot really afford; a long sword known in Nippon as a katana and a short sword known as a wakizashiHiro's father looted these from Japan after World War II went atomicand a computer.The computer is a featureless black wedge.It does not have a power cord, but there is a narrow translucent plastic tube emerging from a hatch on the rear, spiraling across the cargo pallet and the floor, and plugged into a crudely installed fiber optics socket above the head of the sleeping Vitaly Chernobyl.In the center of the plastic tube is a hair thin fiber optic cable.The cable is carrying a lot of information back and forth between Hiro's computer and the rest of the world.In order to transmit the same amount of information on paper, they would have to arrange for a 747 cargo freighter packed with telephone books and encyclopedias to power dive into their unit every couple of minutes, forever.Hiro can't really afford the computer either, but he has to have one.It is a tool of his trade.In the worldwide community of hackers, Hiro is a talented drifter.This is the kind of lifestyle that sounded romantic to him as recently as five years ago.But in the bleak light of full adulthood, which is to one's early twenties as Sunday morning is to Saturday night, he can clearly see what it really amounts to: He's broke and unemployed.And a few short weeks ago, his tenure as a pizza delivererthe only pointless dead end job he really enjoyscame to an end.Since then, he's been putting a lot more emphasis on his auxiliary emergency backup job: freelance stringer for the CIC, the Central Intelligence Corporation of Langley, Virginia.The business is a simple one.Hiro gets information.It may be gossip, videotape, audiotape, a fragment of a computer disk, a xerox of a document.It can even be a joke based on the latest highly publicized disaster.He uploads it to the CIC databasethe Library, formerly the Library of Congress, but no one calls it that anymore.Most people are not entirely clear on what the word congress means.And even the word library is getting hazy.It used to be a place full of books, mostly old ones.Then they began to include videotapes, records, and magazines.Then all of the information got converted into machine readable form, which is to say, ones and zeroes.And as the number of media grew, the material became more up to date, and the methods for searching the Library became more and more sophisticated, it approached the point where there was no substantive difference between the Library of Congress and the Central Intelligence Agency.Fortuitously, this happened just as the government was falling apart anyway.So they merged and kicked out a big fat stock offering.Millions of other CIC stringers are uploading millions of other fragments at the same time.CIC's clients, mostly large corporations and Sovereigns, rifle through the Library looking for useful information, and if they find a use for something that Hiro put into it, Hiro gets paid.A year ago, he uploaded an entire first draft film script that he stole from an agent's wastebasket in Burbank.Half a dozen studios wanted to see it.He ate and vacationed off of that one for six months.Since then, times have been leaner.He has been learning the hard way that 99 percent of the information in the Library never gets used at all.Case in point: After a certain Kourier tipped him off to the existence of Vitaly Chernobyl, he put a few intensive weeks into researching a new musical phenomenonthe rise of Ukrainian nuclear fuzz grunge collectives in L. A.  He has planted exhaustive notes on this trend in the Library, including video and audio.Not one single record label, agent, or rock critic has bothered to access it.The top surface of the computer is smooth except for a fisheye lens, a polished glass dome with a purplish optical coating.Whenever Hiro is using the machine, this lens emerges and clicks into place, its base flush with the surface of the computer.The neighborhood loglo is curved and foreshortened on its surface.Hiro finds it erotic.This is partly because he hasn't been properly laid in several weeks.But there's more to it.Hiro's father, who was stationed in Japan for many years, was obsessed with cameras.He kept bringing them back from his stints in the Far East, encased in many protective layers, so that when he took them out to show Hiro, it was like watching an exquisite striptease as they emerged from all that black leather and nylon, zippers and straps.And once the lens was finally exposed, pure geometric equation made real, so powerful and vulnerable at once, Hiro could only think it was like nuzzling through skirts and lingerie and outer labia and inner labia....It made him feel naked and weak and brave.The lens can see half of the universethe half that is above the computer, which includes most of Hiro.In this way, it can generally keep track of where Hiro is and what direction he's looking in.Down inside the computer are three lasersa red one, a green one, and a blue one.They are powerful enough to make a bright light but not powerful enough to burn through the back of your eyeball and broil your brain, fry your frontals, lase your lobes.As everyone learned in elementary school, these three colors of light can be combined, with different intensities, to produce any color that Hiro's eye is capable of seeing.In this way, a narrow beam of any color can be shot out of the innards of the computer, up through that fisheye lens, in any direction.Through the use of electronic mirrors inside the computer, this beam is made to sweep back and forth across the lenses of Hiro's goggles, in much the same way as the electron beam in a television paints the inner surface of the eponymous Tube.The resulting image hangs in space in front of Hiro's view of Reality.By drawing a slightly different image in front of each eye, the image can be made three dimensional.By changing the image seventy two times a second, it can be made to move.By drawing the moving three dimensional image at a resolution of 2K pixels on a side, it can be as sharp as the eye can perceive, and by pumping stereo digital sound through the little earphones, the moving 3 D pictures can have a perfectly realistic soundtrack.So Hiro's not actually here at all.He's in a computer generated universe that his computer is drawing onto his goggles and pumping into his earphones.In the lingo, this imaginary place is known as the Metaverse.Hiro spends a lot of time in the Metaverse.It beats the shit out of the U Stor It.Hiro is approaching the Street.It is the Broadway, the Champs lyses of the Metaverse.It is the brilliantly lit boulevard that can be seen, miniaturized and backward, reflected in the lenses of his goggles.It does not really exist.But right now, millions of people are walking up and down it.The dimensions of the Street are fixed by a protocol, hammered out by the computer graphics ninja overlords of the Association for Computing Machinery's Global Multimedia Protocol Group.The Street seems to be a grand boulevard going all the way around the equator of a black sphere with a radius of a bit more than ten thousand kilometers.That makes it 65,536 kilometers around, which is considerably bigger than Earth.The number 65,536 is an awkward figure to everyone except a hacker, who recognizes it more readily than his own mother's date of birth: It happens to be a power of 2216 power to be exactand even the exponent 16 is equal to 24, and 4 is equal to 22.Along with 256; 32,768; and 2,147,483,648; 65,536 is one of the foundation stones of the hacker universe, in which 2 is the only really important number because that's how many digits a computer can recognize.One of those digits is 0, and the other is 1.Any number that can be created by fetishistically multiplying 2s by each other, and subtracting the occasional 1, will be instantly recognizable to a hacker.Like any place in Reality, the Street is subject to development.Developers can build their own small streets feeding off of the main one.They can build buildings, parks, signs, as well as things that do not exist in Reality, such as vast hovering overhead light shows, special neighborhoods where the rules of three dimensional spacetime are ignored, and free combat zones where people can go to hunt and kill each other.The only difference is that since the Street does not really existit's just a computer graphics protocol written down on a piece of paper somewherenone of these things is being physically built.They are, rather, pieces of software, made available to the public over the world wide fiber optics network.When Hiro goes into the Metaverse and looks down the Street and sees buildings and electric signs stretching off into the darkness, disappearing over the curve of the globe, he is actually staring at the graphic representationsthe user interfacesof a myriad different pieces of software that have been engineered by major corporations.In order to place these things on the Street, they have had to get approval from the Global Multimedia Protocol Group, have had to buy frontage on the Street, get zoning approval, obtain permits, bribe inspectors, the whole bit.The money these corporations pay to build things on the Street all goes into a trust fund owned and operated by the GMPG, which pays for developing and expanding the machinery that enables the Street to exist.Hiro has a house in a neighborhood just off the busiest part of the Street.It is a very old neighborhood by Street standards.About ten years ago, when the Street protocol was first written, Hiro and some of his buddies pooled their money and bought one of the first development licenses, created a little neighborhood of hackers.At the time, it was just a little patchwork of light amid a vast blackness.Back then, the Street was just a necklace of streetlights around a black ball in space.Since then, the neighborhood hasn't changed much, but the Street has.By getting in on it early, Hiro's buddies got a head start on the whole business.Some of them even got very rich off of it.That's why Hiro has a nice big house in the Metaverse but has to share a 20 by 30 in Reality.Real estate acumen does not always extend across universes.The sky and the ground are black, like a computer screen that hasn't had anything drawn into it yet; it is always nighttime in the Metaverse, and the Street is always garish and brilliant, like Las Vegas freed from constraints of physics and finance.But people in Hiro's neighborhood are very good programmers, so it's tasteful.The houses look like real houses.There are a couple of Frank Lloyd Wright reproductions and some fancy Victoriana.So it's always a shock to step out onto the Street, where everything seems to be a mile high.This is Downtown, the most heavily developed area.If you go a couple of hundred kilometers in either direction, the development will taper down to almost nothing, just a thin chain of streetlights casting white pools on the black velvet ground.But Downtown is a dozen Manhattans, embroidered with neon and stacked on top of each other.In the real worldplanet Earth, Realitythere are somewhere between six and ten billion people.At any given time, most of them are making mud bricks or field stripping their AK 47s.Perhaps a billion of them have enough money to own a computer; these people have more money than all of the others put together.Of these billion potential computer owners, maybe a quarter of them actually bother to own computers, and a quarter of these have machines that are powerful enough to handle the Street protocol.That makes for about sixty million people who can be on the Street at any given time.Add in another sixty million or so who can't really afford it but go there anyway, by using public machines, or machines owned by their school or their employer, and at any given time the Street is occupied by twice the population of New York City.That's why the damn place is so overdeveloped.Put in a sign or a building on the Street and the hundred million richest, hippest, best connected people on earth will see it every day of their lives.It is a hundred meters wide, with a narrow monorail track running down the middle.The monorail is a free piece of public utility software that enables users to change their location on the Street rapidly and smoothly.A lot of people just ride back and forth on it, looking at the sights.When Hiro first saw this place, ten years ago, the monorail hadn't been written yet; he and his buddies had to write car and motorcycle software in order to get around.They would take their software out and race it in the black desert of the electronic night.4  Y. T.  has been privileged to watch many a young Clint plant his sweet face in an empty Burbclave pool during an unauthorized night run, but always on a skateboard, never ever in a car.The landscape of the suburban night has much weird beauty if you just look.Back on the paddle again.It rolls across the yard on a set of RadiKS Mark IV Smartwheels.She upgraded to said magical sprockets after the following ad appeared in Thrasher magazine.CHISELED SPAM  is what you will see in the mirror if you surf on a weak plank with dumb, fixed wheels and interface with a muffler, retread, snow turd, road kill, driveshaft, railroad tie, or unconscious pedestrian.If you think this is unlikely, you've been surfing too many ghost malls.All of these obstacles and more were recently observed on a one mile stretch of the New Jersey Turnpike.Any surfer who tried to groove that 'vard on a stock plank would have been sneezing brains.Don't listen to so called purists who claim any obstacle can be jumped.Professional Kouriers know: If you have pooned a vehicle moving fast enough for fun and profit, your reaction time is cut to tenths of a secondeven less if you are way spooled.Buy a set of RadiKS Mark II Smartwheelsit's cheaper than a total face retread and a lot more fun.Smartwheels use sonar, laser rangefinding, and millimeter wave radar to identify mufflers and other debris before you even get honed about them.Don't get Midasizedupgrade today!These were words of wisdom.Y. T.  bought the wheels.Each one consists of a hub with many stout spokes.Each spoke telescopes in five sections.On the end is a squat foot, rubber tread on the bottom, swiveling on a ball joint.As the wheels roll, the feet plant themselves one at a time, almost glomming into one continuous tire.If you surf over a bump, the spokes retract to pass over it.If you surf over a chuckhole, the robo prongs plumb its asphalty depths.Either way, the shock is thereby absorbed, no thuds, smacks, vibrations, or clunks will make their way into the plank or the Converse hightops with which you tread it.The ad was rightyou cannot be a professional road surfer without smartwheels.Prompt delivery of the pizza will be a trivial matter.She glides from the dewy turf over the lip of the driveway without a bump, picks up speed on the 'crete, surfs down its slope into the street.A twitch of the butt reorients the plank, now she is cruising down Homedale Mews looking for a victim.A black car, alive with nasty lights, whines past her the other way, closing in on the hapless Hiro Protagonist.Her RadiKS Knight Vision goggles darken strategically to cut the noxious glaring of same, her pupils feel safe to remain wide open, scanning the road for signs of movement.The swimming pool was at the crest of this Burbclave, it's downhill from here, but not downhill enough.Half a block away, on a side street, a bimbo box, a minivan, grinds its four pathetic cylinders into action.She sees it catercorner from her present coordinates.The white backup lights flash instantly as the driver shifts into D by way of R and N.  Y. T.  aims herself at the curb, hits it at a fast running velocity, the spokes of the smartwheels see it coming and retract in the right way so that she glides from street to lawn without a hitch.Across the lawn, the feet leave a trail of hexagonal padmarks.A stray dog turd, red with meaty undigestible food coloring, is embossed with the RadiKS logo, a mirror image of which is printed on the tread of each spoke.The bimbo box is pulling away from the curb, across the street.Squirrelly scrubbing noises squirm from its sidewalls as they grind against the curb; we are in the Burbs, where it is better to take a thousand clicks off the lifespan of your Goodyears by invariably grinding them up against curbs than to risk social ostracism and outbreaks of mass hysteria by parking several inches away, out in the middle of the street (That's okay, Mom, I can walk to the curb from here), a menace to traffic, a deadly obstacle to uncertain young bicyclists.Y. T.  has pressed the release button on her poon's reel/handle unit, allowing a meter of cord to unwind.She whips it up and around her head like a bolo on the austral range.She is about to lambada this trite conveyance.The head of the poon, salad bowl size, whistles as it orbits around; this is unnecessary but sounds cool.Pooning a bimbo box takes more skill than a ped would ever imagine, because of their very road unworthiness, their congenital lack of steel or other ferrous matter for the MagnaPoon to bite down on.Now they have superconducting poons that stick to aluminum bodywork by inducing eddy currents in the actual flesh of the car, turning it into an unwilling electromagnet, but Y. T.  does not have one of these.They are the trademark of the hardcore Burbclave surfer, which, despite this evening's entertainment, she is not.Her poon will only stick to steel, iron, or (slightly) to nickel.The only steel in a bimbo box of this make is in the frame.She makes a low slung approach.Her poon's orbital plane is nearly vertical, it almost grinds on the twinkly suburban macadam on the forward limb of each orbit.When she pounds the release button, it takes off from an altitude of about one centimeter, angling slightly upward, across the street, under the floor of the bimbo box, and sucks steel.It's a solid hit, as solid as you can get on this nebula of air, upholstery, paint, and marketing known as the family minivan.The reaction is instantaneous, quick witted by Burb standards.This person wants Y. T.  gone.The van takes off like a hormone pumped bull who has just been nailed in the ass by the barbed probe of a picador.It's not Mom at the wheel.It's young Studley, the teenaged boy, who like every other boy in this Burbclave has been taking intravenous shots of horse testosterone every afternoon in the high school locker room since he was fourteen years old.Now he's bulky, stupid, thoroughly predictable.He steers erratically, artificially pumped muscles not fully under his control.The molded, leather grained, maroon colored steering wheel smells like his mother's hand lotion; this drives him into a rage.The bimbo box surges and slows, surges and slows, because he is pumping the gas pedal, because holding it to the floor doesn't seem to have any effect.He wants this car to be like his muscles: more power than he knows what to do with.Instead, it hampers him.As a compromise, he hits the button that says POWER.Another button that says ECONOMY pops out and goes dead, reminding him, like an educational demonstration, that the two are mutually exclusive.The van's tiny engine downshifts, which makes it feel more powerful.He holds his foot steady on the gas and, making the run down Cottage Heights Road, the minivan's speed approaches one hundred kilometers.Approaching the terminus of Cottage Heights Road, where it tees into Bellewoode Valley Road, he espies a fire hydrant.TMAWH fire hydrants are numerous, for safety, and highly designed, for property values, not the squat iron things imprinted with the name of some godforsaken Industrial Revolution foundry and furry from a hundred variously flaked layers of cheap city paint.They are brass, robot polished every Thursday morning, dignified pipes rising straight up from the perfect, chemically induced turf of the Burbclave lawns, flaring out to present potential firefighters with a menu of three possible hose connections.They were designed on a computer screen by the same aesthetes who designed the Dyna Victorian houses and the tasteful mailboxes and the immense marble street signs that sit at each intersection like headstones.Designed on a computer screen, but with an eye toward the elegance of things past and forgotten about.Fire hydrants that tasteful people are proud to have on their front lawns.Fire hydrants that the real estate people don't feel the need to airbrush out of pictures.This fucking Kourier is about to die, knotted around one of those fire hydrants.Studley the Testosterone Boy will see to it.It is a maneuver he has witnessed on televisionwhich tells no liesa trick he has practiced many times in his head.Building up maximum speed on Cottage Heights, he will yank the hand brake while swinging the wheel.The ass end of the minivan will snap around.The pesky Kourier will be cracked like a whip at the end of her unbreakable cable.Into the fire hydrant she will go.Studley the Teenager will be victorious, free to cruise in triumph down Bellewoode Valley and out into the greater world of adult men in cool cars, free to go return his overdue videotape, Raft Warriors IV: The Final Battle  Y. T.  does not know any of this for a fact, but she suspects it.None of this is real.It is her reconstruction of the psychological environment inside of that bimbo box.She sees the hydrant coming a mile away, sees Studley reaching down to rest one hand on the parking brake.It is all so obvious.She feels sorry for Studley and his ilk.She reels out, gives herself lots of slack.He whips the wheel, jerks the brake.The minivan goes sideways, overshooting its mark, and doesn't quite snap her around the way he wanted; she has to help it.As its ass is rotating around, she reels in hard, converting that gift of angular momentum into forward velocity, and ends up shooting right past the van going well over a mile a minute.She is headed for a marble gravestone that says BELLE WOODE VALLEY ROAD.She leans away from it, leans into a vicious turn, her spokes grip the pavement and push her away from that gravestone, she can touch the pavement with one hand she is heeled over so hard, the spokes push her onto the desired street.Meanwhile, she has clicked off the electromagnetic force that held her pooned to the van.The poon head comes loose, caroms off the pavement behind her as it is automatically reeled in to reunite with the handle.She is headed straight for the exit of the Burbclave at fantastic speed.Behind her, an explosive crash sounds, resonating in her gut, as the minivan slides sideways into the gravestone.She ducks under the security gate and plunges into traffic on Oahu.She cuts between two veering, blaring, and screeching BMWs.BMW drivers take evasive action at the drop of a hat, emulating the drivers in the BMW advertisementsthis is how they convince themselves they didn't get ripped off.She drops into a fetal position to pass underneath a semi, headed for the Jersey barrier in the median strip like she's going to die, but Jersey barriers are easy for the smartwheels.That lower limb of the barrier has such a nice bank to it, like they designed it for road surfers.She rides halfway up the barrier, angles gently back down to the lane for a smooth landing, and she's in traffic.There's a car right there and she doesn't even have to throw the poon, just reaches out and plants it right on the lid of the trunk.This driver's resigned to his fate, doesn't care, doesn't hassle her.He takes her as far as the entrance to the next Burbclave, which is a White Columns.Very southern, traditional, one of the Apartheid Burbclaves.Big ornate sign above the main gate: WHITE PEOPLE ONLY.NON CAUCASIANS MUST BE PROCESSED.She's got a White Columns visa.Y. T.  has a visa to everywhere.It's right there on her chest, a little bar code.A laser scans it as she careens toward the entrance and the immigration gate swings open for her.It's an ornate ironwork number, but harried White Columns residents don't have time to sit idling at the Burbclave entrance watching the gate slowly roll aside in Old South majestic turpitude, so it's mounted on some kind of electromagnetic railgun.She is gliding down the antebellum tree lined lanes of White Columns, one microplantation after another, still coasting on the residual kinetic energy boost that originated in the fuel in Studley the Teenager's gas tank.The world is full of power and energy and a person can go far by just skimming off a tiny bit of it.The LEDs on the pizza box say: 29:32, and the guy who ordered itMr.Pudgely and his neighbors, the Pinkhearts and the Roundass clanare all gathered on the front lawn of their microplantation, prematurely celebrating.Like they had just bought the winning lottery ticket.From their front door they have a clear view all the way down to Oahu Road, and they can see that nothing is on its way that looks like a CosaNostra delivery car.Oh, there is curiositysniffing interestat this Kourier with the big square thing under her armmaybe a portfolio, a new ad layout for some Caucasian supremacist marketing honcho in the next plat over, but  The Pudgelys and the Pinkhearts and the Roundasses are all staring at her, slackjawed.She has just enough residual energy to swing into their driveway.Her momentum carries her to the top.She stops next to Mr.Pudgely's Acura and Mrs.Pudgely's bimbo box and steps off her plank.The spokes, noting her departure, even themselves out, plant themselves on the top of the driveway, refuse to roll backward.A blinding light from the heavens shines down upon them.Her Knight Visions keep her from being blinded, but the customers bend their knees and hunch their shoulders as though the light were heavy.The men hold their hairy forearms up against their brows, swivel their great tubular bodies to and fro, trying to find the source of the illumination, muttering clipped notations to each other, brief theories about its source, fully in control of the unknown phenomenon.The women coo and flutter.Because of the magical influence of the Knight Visions, Y. T.  can still see the LEDs: 29:54, and that's what it says when she drops the pizza on Mr.Pudgely's wing tips.The mystery light goes off.The others are still blinded, but Y. T.  sees into the night with her Knight Visions, sees all the way into near infrared, and she sees the source of it, a double bladed stealth helicopter thirty feet above the neighbor's house.It is tastefully black and unadorned, not a news crewthough another helicopter, an old fashioned audible one, brightly festooned with up to the minute logos, is thumping and whacking its way across White Columns airspace at this very moment, goosing the plantations with its own spotlight, hoping to be the first to obtain this major scoop: a pizza was delivered late tonight, film at eleven.Later, our personality journalist speculates on where Uncle Enzo will stay when he makes his compulsory trip to our Standard Metropolitan Statistical Area.But the black chopper is running dark, would be nearly invisible if not for the infrared trail coming out of its twin turbojets.It is a Mafia chopper, and all they wanted to do was to record the event on videotape so that Mr.Pudgely would not have a leg to hop around on in court, should he decide to take his case down to Judge Bob's Judicial System and argue for a free pizza.One more thing.There's a lot of shit in the air tonight, a few megatons of topsoil blowing down from Fresno, and so when the laser beam comes on it is startlingly visible, a tiny geometric line, a million blazing red grains strung on a fiber optic thread, snapping into life instantly between the chopper and Y. T.'s chest.It appears to widen into a narrow fan, an acute triangle of red light whose base encompasses all of Y. T.'s torso.It takes half a second.They are scanning the many bar codes mounted on her chest.They are finding out who she is.The Mafia now knows everything about Y. T. where she lives, what she does, her eye color, credit record, ancestry, and blood type.That done, the chopper tilts and vanishes into the night like a hockey puck sliding into a bowl of India ink.Mr.Pudgely is saying something, making a joke about how close they came, the others eke out a laugh, but Y. T.  cannot hear them because they are buried under the thunderwhack of the news chopper, then flash frozen and crystalized under its spotlight.The night air is full of bugs, and now Y. T.  can see all of them, swirling in mysterious formations, hitching rides on people and on currents of air.There is one on her wrist, but she doesn't slap at it.The spotlight lingers for a minute.The broad square of the pizza box, bearing the CosaNostra logo, is mute testimony.They hover, shoot a little tape just in case.Y. T.  is bored.She gets on her plank.The wheels blossom and become circular.She guides a tight wobbly course around the cars, coasts down into the street.The spotlight follows her for a moment, maybe picking up some stock footage.Videotape is cheap.You never know when something will be useful, so you might as well videotape it.People make their living that waypeople in the intel business.People like Hiro Protagonist.They just know stuff, or they just go around and videotape stuff.They put it in the Library.When people want to know the particular things that they know or watch their videotapes, they pay them money and check it out of the Library, or just buy it outright.This is a weird racket, but Y. T.  likes the idea of it.Usually, the CIC won't pay any attention to a Kourier.But apparently Hiro has a deal with them.Maybe she can make a deal with Hiro.Because Y. T.  knows a lot of interesting little things.One little thing she knows is that the Mafia owes her a favor.5  As Hiro approaches the Street, he sees two young couples, probably using their parents' computers for a double date in the Metaverse, climbing down out of Port Zero, which is the local port of entry and monorail stop.He is not seeing real people, of course.This is all a part of the moving illustration drawn by his computer according to specifications coming down the fiber optic cable.The people are pieces of software called avatars.They are the audiovisual bodies that people use to communicate with each other in the Metaverse.Hiro's avatar is now on the Street, too, and if the couples coming off the monorail look over in his direction, they can see him, just as he's seeing them.They could strike up a conversation: Hiro in the U Stor It in L. A.  and the four teenagers probably on a couch in a suburb of Chicago, each with their own laptop.But they probably won't talk to each other, any more than they would in Reality.These are nice kids, and they don't want to talk to a solitary crossbreed with a slick custom avatar who's packing a couple of swords.Your avatar can look any way you want it to, up to the limitations of your equipment.If you're ugly, you can make your avatar beautiful.If you've just gotten out of bed, your avatar can still be wearing beautiful clothes and professionally applied makeup.You can look like a gorilla or a dragon or a giant talking penis in the Metaverse.Spend five minutes walking down the Street and you will see all of these.Hiro's avatar just looks like Hiro, with the difference that no matter what Hiro is wearing in Reality, his avatar always wears a black leather kimono.Most hacker types don't go in for garish avatars, because they know that it takes a lot more sophistication to render a realistic human face than a talking penis.Kind of the way people who really know clothing can appreciate the fine details that separate a cheap gray wool suit from an expensive handtailored gray wool suit.You can't just materialize anywhere in the Metaverse, like Captain Kirk beaming down from on high.This would be confusing and irritating to the people around you.It would break the metaphor.Materializing out of nowhere (or vanishing back into Reality) is considered to be a private function best done in the confines of your own House.Most avatars nowadays are anatomically correct, and naked as a babe when they are first created, so in any case, you have to make yourself decent before you emerge onto the Street.Unless you're something intrinsically indecent and you don't care.If you are some peon who does not own a House, for example, a person who is coming in from a public terminal, then you materialize in a Port.There are 256 Express Ports on the street, evenly spaced around its circumference at intervals of 256 kilometers.Each of these intervals is further subdivided 256 times with Local Ports, spaced exactly one kilometer apart (astute students of hacker semiotics will note the obsessive repetition of the number 256, which is 28 powerand even that 8 looks pretty juicy, dripping with 22 additional 2s).The Ports serve a function analogous to airports: This is where you drop into the Metaverse from somewhere else.Once you have materialized in a Port, you can walk down the Street or hop on the monorail or whatever.The couples coming off the monorail can't afford to have custom avatars made and don't know how to write their own.They have to buy off the shelf avatars.One of the girls has a pretty nice one.It would be considered quite the fashion statement among the K Tel set.Looks like she has bought the Avatar Construction SetTM and put together her own, customized model out of miscellaneous parts.It might even look something like its owner.Her date doesn't look half bad himself.The other girl is a Brandy.Her date is a Clint.Brandy and Clint are both popular, off the shelf models.When white trash high school girls are going on a date in the Metaverse, they invariably run down to the computer games section of the local Wal Mart and buy a copy of Brandy.The user can select three breast sizes: improbable, impossible, and ludicrous.Brandy has a limited repertoire of facial expressions: cute and pouty; cute and sultry; perky and interested; smiling and receptive; cute and spacy.Her eyelashes are half an inch long, and the software is so cheap that they are rendered as solid ebony chips.When a Brandy flutters her eyelashes, you can almost feel the breeze.Clint is just the male counterpart of Brandy.He is craggy and handsome and has an extremely limited range of facial expressions.Hiro wonders, idly, how these two couples got together.They are clearly from disparate social classes.Perhaps older and younger siblings.But then they come down the escalator and disappear into the crowd and become part of the Street, where there are enough Clints and Brandys to found a new ethnic group.The Street is fairly busy.Most of the people here are Americans and Asiansit's early morning in Europe right now.Because of the preponderance of Americans, the crowd has a garish and surreal look about it.For the Asians, it's the middle of the day, and they are in their dark blue suits.For the Americans, it's party time, and they are looking like just about anything a computer can render.The moment Hiro steps across the line separating his neighborhood from the Street, colored shapes begin to swoop down on him from all directions, like buzzards on fresh road kill.Animercials are not allowed in Hiro's neighborhood.But almost anything is allowed in the Street.A passing fighter plane bursts into flames, falls out of its trajectory, and zooms directly toward him at twice the speed of sound.It plows into the Street fifty feet in front of him, disintegrates, and explodes, blooming into a tangled cloud of wreckage and flame that skids across the pavement toward him, growing to envelop him so that all he can see is turbulent flame, perfectly simulated and rendered.Then the display freezes, and a man materializes in front of Hiro.He is a classic bearded, pale, skinny hacker, trying to beef himself up by wearing a bulky silk windbreaker blazoned with the logo of one of the big Metaverse amusement parks.Hiro knows the guy; they used to run into each other at trade conventions all the time.He's been trying to hire Hiro for the last two months.Hiro, I can't understand why you're holding out on me.We're making bucks hereKongbucks and yenand we can be flexible on pay and bennies.We're putting together a swords and sorcery thing, and we can use a hacker with your skills.Come on down and talk to me, okay?Hiro walks straight through the display, and it vanishes.Amusement parks in the Metaverse can be fantastic, offering a wide selection of interactive three dimensional movies.But in the end, they're still nothing more than video games.Hiro's not so poor, yet, that he would go and write video games for this company.It's owned by the Nipponese, which is no big deal.But it's also managed by the Nipponese, which means that all the programmers have to wear white shirts and show up at eight in the morning and sit in cubicles and go to meetings.When Hiro learned how to do this, way back fifteen years ago, a hacker could sit down and write an entire piece of software by himself.Now, that's no longer possible.Software comes out of factories, and hackers are, to a greater or lesser extent, assembly line workers.Worse yet, they may become managers who never get to write any code themselves.The prospect of becoming an assembly line worker gives Hiro some incentive to go out and find some really good intel tonight.He tries to get himself psyched up, tries to break out of the lethargy of the long term underemployed.This intel thing can be a great racket, once you get yourself jacked into the grid.And with his connections, it shouldn't be any problem.He just has to get serious about it.Get serious.Get serious.But it's so hard to get serious about anything.He owes the Mafia the cost of a new car.That's a good reason to get serious.He cuts straight across the Street and under the monorail line, headed for a large, low slung black building.It is extraordinarily somber for the Street, like a parcel that someone forgot to develop.It's a squat black pyramid with the top cut off.It has one single doorsince this is all imaginary, there are no regulations dictating the number of emergency exits.There are no guards, no signs, nothing to bar people from going in, yet thousands of avatars mill around, peering inside, looking for a glimpse of something.These people can't pass through the door because they haven't been invited.Above the door is a matte black hemisphere about a meter in diameter, set into the front wall of the building.It is the closest thing the place has to decoration.Underneath it, in letters carved into the wall's black substance, is the name of the place: THE BLACK SUN.So it's not an architectural masterpiece.When Da5id and Hiro and the other hackers wrote The Black Sun, they didn't have enough money to hire architects or designers, so they just went in for simple geometric shapes.The avatars milling around the entrance don't seem to care.If these avatars were real people in a real street, Hiro wouldn't be able to reach the entrance.It's way too crowded.But the computer system that operates the Street has better things to do than to monitor every single one of the millions of people there, trying to prevent them from running into each other.It doesn't bother trying to solve this incredibly difficult problem.On the Street, avatars just walk right through each other.So when Hiro cuts through the crowd, headed for the entrance, he really is cutting through the crowd.When things get this jammed together, the computer simplifies things by drawing all of the avatars ghostly and translucent so you can see where you're going.Hiro appears solid to himself, but everyone else looks like a ghost.He walks through the crowd as if it's a fogbank, clearly seeing The Black Sun in front of him.He steps over the property line, and he's in the doorway.And in that instant he becomes solid and visible to all the avatars milling outside.As one, they all begin screaming.Not that they have any idea who the hell he isHiro is just a starving CIC stringer who lives in a U Stor It by the airport.But in the entire world there are only a couple of thousand people who can step over the line into The Black Sun.He turns and looks back at ten thousand shrieking groupies.Now that he's all by himself in the entryway, no longer immersed in a flood of avatars, he can see all of the people in the front row of the crowd with perfect clarity.They are all done up in their wildest and fanciest avatars, hoping that Da5idThe Black Sun's owner and hacker in chiefwill invite them inside.They flicker and merge together into a hysterical wall.Stunningly beautiful women, computer airbrushed and retouched at seventy two frames a second, like Playboy pinups turned three dimensionalthese are would be actresses hoping to be discovered.Wild looking abstracts, tornadoes of gyrating lighthackers who are hoping that Da5id will notice their talent, invite them inside, give them a job.A liberal sprinkling of black and white peoplepersons who are accessing the Metaverse through cheap public terminals, and who are rendered in jerky, grainy black and white.A lot of these are run of the mill psycho fans, devoted to the fantasy of stabbing some particular actress to death; they can't even get close in Reality, so they goggle into the Metaverse to stalk their prey.There are would be rock stars done up in laser light, as though they just stepped off the concert stage, and the avatars of Nipponese businessmen, exquisitely rendered by their fancy equipment, but utterly reserved and boring in their suits.There's one black and white who stands out because he's taller than the rest.The Street protocol states that your avatar can't be any taller than you are.This is to prevent people from walking around a mile high.Besides, if this guy's using a pay terminalwhich he must be, to judge from the image qualityit can't jazz up his avatar.It just shows him the way he is, except not as well.Talking to a black and white on the Street is like talking to a person who has his face stuck in a xerox machine, repeatedly pounding the copy button, while you stand by the output tray pulling the sheets out one at a time and looking at them.He has long hair, parted in the middle like a curtain to reveal a tattoo on his forehead.Given the shitty resolution, there's no way to see the tattoo clearly, but it appears to consist of words.He has a wispy Fu Manchu mustache.Hiro realizes that the guy has noticed him and is staring back, looking him up and down, paying particular attention to the swords.A grin spreads across the black and white guy's face.It is a satisfied grin.A grin of recognition.The grin of a man who knows something Hiro doesn't.The black and white guy has been standing with his arms folded across his chest, like a man who is bored, who's been waiting for something, and now his arms drop to his sides, swing loosely at the shoulders, like an athlete limbering up.He steps as close as he can and leans forward; he's so tall that the only thing behind him is empty black sky, torn with the glowing vapor trails of passing animercials.Hey, Hiro, the black and white guy says, you want to try some Snow Crash?A lot of people hang around in front of The Black Sun saying weird things.You ignore them.But this gets Hiro's attention.Oddity the first: The guy knows Hiro's name.But people have ways of getting that information.It's probably nothing.The second: This sounds like an offer from a drug pusher.Which would be normal in front of a Reality bar.But this is the Metaverse.And you can't sell drugs in the Metaverse, because you can't get high by looking at something.The third: The name of the drug.Hiro's never heard of a drug called Snow Crash before.That's not unusuala thousand new drugs get invented each year, and each of them sells under half a dozen brand names.But snow crash is computer lingo.It means a system crasha bugat such a fundamental level that it frags the part of the computer that controls the electron beam in the monitor, making it spray wildly across the screen, turning the perfect gridwork of pixels into a gyrating blizzard.Hiro has seen it happen a million times.But it's a very peculiar name for a drug.The thing that really gets Hiro's attention is his confidence.He has an utterly calm, stolid presence.It's like talking to an asteroid.Which would be okay if he were doing something that made the tiniest little bit of sense.Hiro's trying to read some clues in the guy's face, but the closer he looks, the more his shitty black and white avatar seems to break up into jittering, hard edged pixels.It's like putting his nose against the glass of a busted TV.It makes his teeth hurt.Excuse me, Hiro says.What did you say?You want to try some Snow Crash?He has a crisp accent that Hiro can't quite place.His audio is as bad as his video.Hiro can hear cars going past the guy in the background.He must be goggled in from a public terminal alongside some freeway.I don't get this, Hiro says.What is Snow Crash?It's a drug, asshole, the guy says.What do you think?Wait a minute.This is a new one on me, Hiro says.You honestly think I'm going to give you some money here?And then what do I do, wait for you to mail me the stuff?I said try, not buy, the guy says.You don't have to give me any money.Free sample.And you don't have to wait for no mail.You can have it now.He reaches into his pocket and pulls out a hypercard.It looks like a business card.The hypercard is an avatar of sorts.It is used in the Metaverse to represent a chunk of data.It might be text, audio, video, a still image, or any other information that can be represented digitally.Think of a baseball card, which carries a picture, some text, and some numerical data.A baseball hypercard could contain a highlight film of the player in action, shown in perfect high def television; a complete biography, read by the player himself, in stereo digital sound; and a complete statistical database along with specialized software to help you look up the numbers you want.A hypercard can carry a virtually infinite amount of information.For all Hiro knows, this hypercard might contain all the books in the Library of Congress, or every episode of Hawaii Five O that was ever filmed, or the complete recordings of Jimi Hendrix, or the 1950 Census.Ormore likelya wide variety of nasty computer viruses.If Hiro reaches out and takes the hypercard, then the data it represents will be transferred from this guy's system into Hiro's computer.Hiro, naturally, wouldn't touch it under any circumstances, any more than you would take a free syringe from a stranger in Times Square and jab it into your neck.And it doesn't make sense anyway.That's a hypercard.I thought you said Snow Crash was a drug, Hiro says, now totally nonplussed.It is, the guy says.Try it.Does it fuck up your brain?Hiro says.Or your computer?Both.Neither.What's the difference?Hiro finally realizes that he has just wasted sixty seconds of his life having a meaningless conversation with a paranoid schizophrenic.He turns around and goes into The Black Sun.6  At the exit of White Columns sits a black car, curled up like a panther, a burnished steel lens reflecting the loglo of Oahu Road.It is a Unit.It is a Mobile Unit of MetaCops Unlimited.A silvery badge is embossed on its door, a chrome plated cop badge the size of a dinner plate, bearing the name of said private peace organization and emblazoned    DIAL 1 800 THE COPS  All Major Credit Cards    MetaCops Unlimited is the official peacekeeping force of White Columns, and also of The Mews at Windsor Heights, The Heights at Bear Run, Cinnamon Grove, and The Farms of Cloverdelle.They also enforce traffic regulations on all highways and byways operated by Fairlanes, Inc.A few different FOQNEs also use them: Caymans Plus and The Alps, for example.But franchise nations prefer to have their own security force.You can bet that Metazania and New South Africa handle their own security; that's the only reason people become citizens, so they can get drafted.Obviously, Nova Sicilia has its own security, too.Narcolombia doesn't need security because people are scared just to drive past the franchise at less than a hundred miles an hour (Y. T.  always snags a nifty power boost in neighborhoods thick with Narcolombia consulates), and Mr.Lee's Greater Hong Kong, the grandaddy of all FOQNEs, handles it in a typically Hong Kong way, with robots.MetaCops' main competitor, WorldBeat Security, handles all roads belonging to Cruiseways, plus has worldwide contracts with Dixie Traditionals, Pickett's Plantation, Rainbow Heights (check it outtwo apartheid Burbclaves and one for black suits), Meadowvale on the [insert name of river] and Brickyard Station.WorldBeat is smaller than MetaCops, handles more upscale contracts, supposedly has a bigger espionage armthough if that's what people want, they just talk to an account rep at the Central Intelligence Corporation.And then there's The Enforcersbut they cost a lot and don't take well to supervision.It is rumored that, under their uniforms, they wear T shirts bearing the unofficial Enforcer coat of arms: a fist holding a nightstick, emblazoned with the words SUE ME.So Y. T.  is coasting down a gradual slope toward the heavy iron gate of White Columns, waiting for it to roll aside, waiting, waitingbut the gate does not seem to be opening.No laser pulse has shot out of the guard shack to find out who Y. T.  is.The system has been overridden.If Y. T.  was a stupid ped she would go up to the MetaCop and ask him why.The MetaCop would say, The security of the city state, and nothing more.These Burbclaves!These city states!So small, so insecure, that just about everything, like not mowing your lawn, or playing your stereo too loud, becomes a national security issue.No way to skate around the fence; White Columns has eight foot iron, robo wrought, all the way around.She rolls up to the gate, grabs the bars, rattles it, but it's too big and solid to rattle.MetaCops aren't allowed to lean against their Unitmakes them look lazy and weak.They can almost lean, look like they're leaning, they can even brandish a big leaning against the car 'tude like this particular individual, but they can't lean.Besides, with the complete, glinting majesty of their Personal Portable Equipment Suite hanging on their Personal Modular Equipment Harness, they would scratch the finish of the Unit.Jack this barrier to commerce, man, I got deliveries to make, Y. T.  announces to the MetaCop.A wet, smacking burst, not loud enough to be an explosion, sounds from the back of the Mobile Unit.It is the soft thup of a thick wrestler's loogie being propelled through a rolled up tongue.It is the distant, muffled splurt of a baby having a big one.Y. T.'s hand, still gripping the bars of the gate, stings for a moment, then feels cold and hot at the same time.She can barely move it.She smells vinyl.The MetaCop's partner climbs out of the back seat of the Mobile Unit.The window of the back door is open, but everything on the Mobile Unit is so black and shiny you can't tell that until the door moves.Both MetaCops, under their glossy black helmets and night vision goggles, are grinning.The one getting out of the Mobile Unit is carrying a Short Range Chemical Restraint Projectora loogie gun.Their little plan has worked.Y. T.  didn't think to aim her Knight Visions into the back seat to check for a goo firing sniper.The loogie, when expanded into the air like this, is about the size of a football.Miles and miles of eensy but strong fibers, like spaghetti.The sauce on the spaghetti is sticky, goopy stuff that stays fluid for an instant, when the loogie gun is fired, then sets quickly.MetaCops have to tote this kind of gear because when each franchulate is so small, you can't be chasing people around.The perpalmost always an innocent thrasheris always a three second skateboard ride away from asylum in the neighboring franchulate.Also, the incredible bulk of the Personal Modular Equipment Harnessthe chandelier o' gearand all that is clipped onto it slows them down so bad that whenever they try to run, people just start laughing at them.So instead of losing some pounds, they just clip more stuff onto their harnesses, like the loogie gun.The snotty, fibrous drop of stuff has wrapped all the way around her hand and forearm and lashed them onto the bar of the gate.Excess goo has sagged and run down the bar a short ways, but is setting now, turning into rubber.A few loose strands have also whipped forward and gained footholds on her shoulder, chest, and lower face.She backs away and the adhesive separates from the fibers, stretching out into long, infinitely thin strands, like hot mozzarella.These set instantly, become solid, and then break, curling away like smoke.It is not quite so grotendous, now that the loogie is off her face, but her hand is still perfectly immobilized.You are hereby warned that any movement on your part not explicitly endorsed by verbal authorization on my part may pose a direct physical risk to you, as well as consequential psychological and possibly, depending on your personal belief system, spiritual risks ensuing from your personal reaction to said physical risk.Any movement on your part constitutes an implicit and irrevocable acceptance of such risk, the first MetaCop says.There is a little speaker on his belt, simultaneously translating all of this into Spanish and Japanese.Or as we used to say, the other MetaCop says, freeze, sucker!The untranslatable word resonates from the little speaker, pronounced esucker and saka respectively.We are authorized Deputies of MetaCops Unlimited.Under Section 24.5.2 of the White Columns Code, we are authorized to carry out the actions of a police force on this territory.Such as hassling innocent thrashers, Y. T.  says.The MetaCop turns off the translator.By speaking English you implicitly and irrevocably agree for all our future conversation to take place in the English language, he says.You can't even rez what Y. T.  says, Y. T.  says.You have been identified as an Investigatory Focus of a Registered Criminal Event that is alleged to have taken place on another territory, namely, The Mews at Windsor Heights.That's another country, man.This is White Columns!Under provisions of The Mews at Windsor Heights Code, we are authorized to enforce law, national security concerns, and societal harmony on said territory also.A treaty between The Mews at Windsor Heights and White Columns authorizes us to place you in temporary custody until your status as an Investigatory Focus has been resolved.Your ass is busted, the second MetaCop says.As your demeanor has been nonaggressive and you carry no visible weapons, we are not authorized to employ heroic measures to ensure your cooperation, the first MetaCop says.You stay cool and we'll stay cool, the second MetaCop says.However, we are equipped with devices, including but not limited to projectile weapons, which, if used, may pose an extreme and immediate threat to your health and well being.Make one funny move and we'll blow your head off, the second MetaCop says.Just unglom my fuckin' hand, Y. T.  says.She has heard all this a million times before.White Columns, like most Burbclaves, has no jail, no police station.So unsightly.Property values.Think of the liability exposure.MetaCops has a franchise just down the road that serves as headquarters.As for a jail, some place to habeas the occasional stray corpus, any half decent franchise strip has one.They are cruising in the Mobile Unit.Y. T.'s hands are cuffed together in front of her.One hand is still half encased in rubbery goo, smelling so intensely of vinyl fumes that both MetaCops have rolled down their windows.Six feet of loose fibers trail into her lap, across the floor of the Unit, out the door, and drag on the pavement.The MetaCops are taking it easy, cruising down the middle lane, not above issuing a speeding ticket here and there as long as they're in their jurisdiction.Motorists around them drive slowly and sanely, appalled by the thought of having to pull over and listen to half an hour of disclaimers, advisements, and tangled justifications from the likes of these.The occasional CosaNostra delivery boy whips past them in the left lane, orange lights aflame, and they pretend not to notice.What's it gonna be, the Hoosegow or The Clink?the first MetaCop says.From the way he is talking, he must be talking to the other MetaCop.The Hoosegow, please, Y. T.  says.The Clink!the other MetaCop says, turning around, sneering at her through the antiballistic glass, wallowing in power.The whole interior of the car lights up as they drive past a Buy 'n' Fly.Loiter in the parking lot of a Buy 'n' Fly and you'd get a suntan.Then WorldBeat Security would come and arrest you.All that security inducing light makes the Visa and MasterCard stickers on the driver's side window glow for a moment.Y. T.  is card carrying, Y. T.  says.What does it cost to get off?How come you keep calling yourself Whitey?the second MetaCop says.Like many people of color, he has misconstrued her name.Not whitey.Y. T. , the first MetaCop says.That's what Y. T.  is called, Y. T.  says.That's what I said, the second MetaCop says.Whitey.Y. T. , the first one says, accenting the T so brutally that he throws a glittering burst of saliva against the windshield.Let me guessYolanda Truman?No.Yvonne Thomas?No.Whatsit stand for?Nothing.Actually, it stands for Yours Truly, but if they can't figure that out, fuck 'em.You can't afford it, the first MetaCop says.You're going up against TMAWH here.I don't have to officially get off.I could just escape.This is a class Unit.We don't support escapes, the first MetaCop says.Tell you what, the second one says.You pay us a trillion bucks and we'll take you to a Hoosegow.Then you can bargain with them.Half a trillion, Y. T.  says.Seven hundred and fifty billion, the MetaCop says.Final.Shit, you're wearing cuffs, you can't be bargaining with us.Y. T.  unzips a pocket on the thigh of her coverall, pulls out the card with her clean hand, runs it through a slot on the back of the front seat, puts it back in her pocket.The Hoosegow looks like a nice new one.Y. T.  has seen hotels that were worse places to sleep.Its logo sign, a saguaro cactus with a black cowboy hat resting on top of it at a jaunty angle, is brand new and clean.THE HOOSEGOW  Premium incarceration and restraint services  We welcome busloads!There are a couple of other MetaCop cars in the lot, and an Enforcer paddybus parked across the back, taking up ten consecutive spaces.This draws much attention from the MetaCops.The Enforcers are to the MetaCops what the Delta Force is to the Peace Corps.One to check in, says the second MetaCop.They are standing in the reception area.The walls are lined with illuminated signs, each one bearing the image of some Old West desperado.Annie Oakley stares down blankly at Y. T. , providing a role model.The check in counter is faux rustic; the employees all wear cowboy hats and five pointed stars with their names embossed on them.In back is a door made of hokey, old fashioned iron bars.Once you got through there, it would look like an operating room.A whole line of little cells, curvy and white like prefab shower stallsin fact, they double as shower stalls, you bathe in the middle of the room.Bright lights that turn themselves off at eleven o'clock.Coin operated TV.Private phone line.Y. T.  can hardly wait.The cowboy behind the desk aims a scanner at Y. T. , zaps her bar code.Hundreds of pages about Y. T.'s personal life zoom up on a graphics screen.Huh, he says.Female.The two MetaCops look at each other like, what a geniusthis guy could never be a MetaCop.Sorry, boys, we're full up.No space for females tonight.Aw, c'mon.See that bus in back?There was a riot at Snooze 'n' Cruise.Some Narcolombians were selling a bad batch of Vertigo.Place went nuts.Enforcers sent in a half dozen squads, brought in about thirty.So we're full up.Try The Clink, down the street.Y. T.  does not like the looks of this.They put her back in the car, turn on the noise cancellation in the back seat, so she can't hear anything except squirts and gurgles coming from her own empty tummy, and the glistening crackle whenever she moves her glommed up hand.She was really looking forward to a Hoosegow mealCampfire Chili or Bandit Burgers.In the front seat, the two MetaCops are talking to each other.They pull out into traffic.Up in front of them is a square illuminated logo, a giant Universal Product Code in black on white with BUY 'N' FLY underneath it.Stuck onto the same signpost, beneath the Buy 'n' Fly sign, is a smaller one, a narrow strip in generic lettering: THE CLINK.They are taking her to The Clink.The bastards.She pounds on the glass with cuffed together hands, leaving sticky handprints.Let these bastards try to wash the stuff off.They turn around and look right through her, the guilty scum, like they heard something but they can't imagine what.They enter the Buy 'n' Fly's nimbus of radioactive blue security light.Second MetaCop goes in, talks to the guy behind the counter.There's a fat white boy purchasing a monster trucks magazine, wearing a New South Africa baseball cap with a Confederate flag, and overhearing them he peers out the window, wanting to lay his eyes on a real perp.A second man comes out from back, same ethnicity as the guy behind the counter, another dark man with burning eyes and a bony neck.This one is carrying a three ring binder with the Buy 'n' Fly logo.To find the manager of a franchise, don't strain to read his title off the name tag, just look for the one with the binder.The manager talks to the MetaCop, nods his head, pulls a keychain out of a drawer.Second MetaCop comes out, saunters to the car, suddenly whips open the back door.Shut up, he says, or next time I fire the loogie gun into your mouth.Good thing you like The Clink, Y. T.  says, cause that is where you will be tomorrow night, loogie man.'Zat right?Yeah.For credit card fraud.Me cop, you thrasher.How you gonna make a case at Judge Bob's Judicial System?I work for RadiKS.We protect our own.Not tonight you don't.Tonight you took a pizza from the scene of a car wreck.Left the scene of an accident.RadiKS tell you to deliver that pizza?Y. T.  does not return fire.The MetaCop is right; RadiKS did not tell her to deliver that pizza.She was doing it on a whim.So RadiKS ain't gonna help you.So shut up.He jerks her arm, and the rest of her follows.The three ringer gives her a quick look, just long enough to make sure she is really a person, not a sack of flour or an engine block or a tree stump.He leads them around to the fetid rump of the Buy 'n' Fly, dark realm of wretched refuse in teeming dumpsters.He unlocks the back door, a boring steel number with jimmy marks around the edges like steel clawed beasts have been trying to get in.Y. T.  is taken downstairs into the basement.First MetaCop follows, carrying her plank, banging it heedlessly against doorways and stained polycarbonate bottle racks.Better take her uniformall that gear, the second MetaCop suggests, not unlewdly.The manager looks at Y. T. , trying not to let his gaze travel sinfully up and down her body.For thousands of years his people have survived on alertness: waiting for Mongols to come galloping over the horizon, waiting for repeat offenders to swing sawed off shotguns across their check out counters.His alertness right now is palpable and painful; he's like a goblet of hot nitroglycerin.The added question of sexual misconduct makes it even worse.To him it's no joke.Y. T.  shrugs, trying to think of something unnerving and wacky.At this point, she is supposed to squeal and shrink, wriggle and whine, swoon and beg.They are threatening to take her clothes.How awful.But she does not get upset because she knows that they are expecting her to.A Kourier has to establish space on the pavement.Predictable law abiding behavior lulls drivers.They mentally assign you to a little box in the lane, assume you will stay there, can't handle it when you leave that little box.Y. T.  is not fond of boxes.Y. T.  establishes her space on the pavement by zagging mightily from lane to lane, establishing a precedent of scary randomness.Keeps people on their toes, makes them react to her, instead of the other way round.Now these men are trying to put her in a box, make her follow rules.She unzips her coverall all the way down below her navel.Underneath is naught but billowing pale flesh.The MetaCops raise their eyebrows.The manager jumps back, raises both hands up to form a visual shield, protecting himself from the damaging input.No, no, no!he says.Y. T.  shrugs, zips herself back up.She's not afraid; she's wearing a dentata.The manager handcuffs her to a cold water pipe.Second MetaCop removes his newer, more cybernetic brand of handcuffs, snaps them back onto his harness.First MetaCop leans her plank against the wall, just out of her reach.Manager kicks a rusty coffee can across the floor, caroming it expertly off her skin, so she can go to the bathroom.Where you from?Y. T.  asks.Tadzhikistan, he says.A jeek.She should have known.Well, shitcan soccer must be your national pastime.The manager doesn't get it.The MetaCops emit rote, shallow laughter.Papers are signed.Everyone else goes upstairs.On his way out the door, the manager turns off the lights; in Tadzhikistan, electricity is quite the big deal.Y. T.  is in The Clink.7  The Black Sun is as big as a couple of football fields laid side by side.The decor consists of black, square tabletops hovering in the air (it would be pointless to draw in legs), evenly spaced across the floor in a grid.Like pixels.The only exception is in the middle, where the bar's four quadrants come together (4 = 22).This part is occupied by a circular bar sixteen meters across.Everything is matte black, which makes it a lot easier for the computer system to draw things in on top of itno worries about filling in a complicated background.And that way all attention can be focused on the avatars, which is the way people like it.It doesn't pay to have a nice avatar on the Street, where it's so crowded and all the avatars merge and flow into one another.But The Black Sun is a much classier piece of software.In The Black Sun, avatars are not allowed to collide.Only so many people can be here at once, and they can't walk through each other.Everything is solid and opaque and realistic.And the clientele has a lot more classno talking penises in here.The avatars look like real people.For the most part, so do the daemons.Daemon is an old piece of jargon from the UNIX operating system, where it referred to a piece of low level utility software, a fundamental part of the operating system.In The Black Sun, a daemon is like an avatar, but it does not represent a human being.It's a robot that lives in the Metaverse.A piece of software, a kind of spirit that inhabits the machine, usually with some particular role to carry out.The Black Sun has a number of daemons that serve imaginary drinks to the patrons and run little errands for people.It even has bouncer daemons that get rid of undesirablesgrab their avatars and throw them out the door, applying certain basic principles of avatar physics.Da5id has even enhanced the physics of The Black Sun to make it a little cartoonish, so that particularly obnoxious people can be hit over the head with giant mallets or crushed under plummeting safes before they are ejected.This happens to people who are being disruptive, to anyone who is pestering or taping a celebrity, and to anyone who seems contagious.That is, if your personal computer is infected with viruses, and attempts to spread them via The Black Sun, you had better keep one eye on the ceiling.Hiro mumbles the word Bigboard.This is the name of a piece of software he wrote, a power tool for a CIC stringer.It digs into The Black Sun's operating system, rifles it for information, and then throws up a flat square map in front of his face, giving him a quick overview of who's here and whom they're talking to.It's all unauthorized data that Hiro is not supposed to have.But Hiro is not some bimbo actor coming here to network.He is a hacker.If he wants some information, he steals it right out of the guts of the systemgossip ex machina.Bigboard shows him that Da5id is ensconced in his usual place, a table in the Hacker Quadrant near the bar.The Movie Star Quadrant has the usual scattering of Sovereigns and wannabes.The Rock Star Quadrant is very busy tonight; Hiro can see that a Nipponese rap star named Sushi K has stopped in for a visit.And there are a lot of record industry types hanging around in the Nipponese Quadrantwhich looks like the other quadrants except that it's quieter, the tables are closer to the floor, and it's full of bowing and fluttering geisha daemons.Many of these people probably belong to Sushi K's retinue of managers, flacks, and lawyers.Hiro cuts across the Hacker Quadrant, headed for Da5id's table.He recognizes many of the people in here, but as usual, he's surprised and disturbed by the number he doesn't recognizeall those sharp, perceptive twenty one year old faces.Software development, like professional sports, has a way of making thirty year old men feel decrepit.Looking up the aisle toward Da5id's table, he sees Da5id talking to a black and white person.Despite her lack of color and shitty resolution, Hiro recognizes her by the way she folds her arms when she's talking, the way she tosses her hair when she's listening to Da5id.Hiro's avatar stops moving and stares at her, adopting just the same facial expression with which he used to stare at this woman years ago.In Reality, he reaches out with one hand, picks up his beer, takes a pull on the bottle, and lets it roll around in his mouth, a bundle of waves clashing inside a small space.Her name is Juanita Marquez.Hiro has known her ever since they were freshmen together at Berkeley, and they were in the same lab section in a freshman physics class.The first time he saw her, he formed an impression that did not change for many years: She was a dour, bookish, geeky type who dressed like she was interviewing for a job as an accountant at a funeral parlor.At the same time, she had a flamethrower tongue that she would turn on people at the oddest times, usually in some grandiose, earth scorching retaliation for a slight or breach of etiquette that none of the other freshmen had even perceived.It wasn't until a number of years later, when they both wound up working at Black Sun Systems, Inc., that he put the other half of the equation together.At the time, both of them were working on avatars.He was working on bodies, she was working on faces.She was the face department, because nobody thought that faces were all that importantthey were just flesh toned busts on top of the avatars.She was just in the process of proving them all desperately wrong.But at this phase, the all male society of bitheads that made up the power structure of Black Sun Systems said that the face problem was trivial and superficial.It was, of course, nothing more than sexism, the especially virulent type espoused by male techies who sincerely believe that they are too smart to be sexists.That first impression, back at the age of seventeen, was nothing more than thatthe gut reaction of a post adolescent Army brat who had been on his own for about three weeks.His mind was good, but he only understood one or two things in the whole worldsamurai movies and the Macintoshand he understood them far, far too well.
