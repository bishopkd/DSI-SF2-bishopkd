  To Jesse   The word must communicate something (other than itself)  Walter Benjamin, On Language as Such and on the Language of Man    PROLOGUE  THE CHILDREN of the embassy all saw the boat land.Their teachers and shiftparents had had them painting it for days.One wall of the room had been given over to their ideas.Its been centuries since any voidcraft vented fire, as they imagined this one doing, but its a tradition to represent them with such trails.When I was young, I painted ships the same way.I looked at the pictures and the man beside me leaned in too.Look, I said.See?Thats you.A face at the boats window.The man smiled.He gripped a pretend wheel like the simply rendered figure.You have to excuse us, I said, nodding at the decorations.Were a bit parochial.No, no, the pilot said.I was older than him, dressed up and dropping slang to tell him stories.He enjoyed me flustering him.Anyway, he said, thats not...It is amazing though.Coming here.To the edge.With Lord knows whats beyond.He looked into the Arrival Ball.THERE WERE other parties: seasonals, comings out, graduations and yearsends, the three Christmases of December; but the Arrival Ball was always the most important.Dictated by the vagaries of trade winds, it was irregular and rare.It had been years since the last.Diplomacy Hall was crowded.Mingling with the embassy staff were security, teachers and physicians, local artists.There were delegates from isolated outsider communities, hermit farmers.There were very few newcomers from the out, in clothes the locals would soon emulate.The crew was due to leave the next day or the one after; Arrival Balls always came at the end of a visit, as if celebrating an arrival and a departure at once.A string septet played.One of the members was my friend Gharda, who saw me and frowned an apology for the unsubtle jig she was halfway through.Young men and women were dancing.They were licensed embarrassments to their bosses and elders, who would themselves, to their younger colleagues delight, sometimes sway or turn a humorously stilted pirouette.By the temporary display of childrens illustrations were Diplomacy Halls permanent hangings: oils and gouaches, flat and trid photographs of staff, Ambassadors and attachs; even of Hosts.They tracked the citys history.Creepers reached the height of the panelling to a deco cornice, spread into a thicket canopy.The wood was designed to sustain them.Their leaves were disturbed by thumb sized vespcams hunting for images to transmit.A security man Id been friends with years before waved a brief greeting with his prosthesis.He was silhouetted in a window metres high and wide, which overlooked the city and Lilypad Hill.Behind that slope was the boat, loaded with cargo.Beyond kilometres of roofs, past rotating church beacons, were the power stations.They had been made uneasy by the landing, and were still skittish, days later.I could see them stamping.Thats you, I said, pointing them out to the steersman.Thats your fault.He laughed but he was only half looking.He was distracted by pretty much everything.This was his first descent.I thought I recognised a lieutenant from a previous party.On his last arrival, years before, it had been a mild autumn in the embassy.Hed walked with me through the leaves of the high floor gardens and stared into the city, where it had not been autumn, nor any other season he could have known.I walked through smoke from salvers of stimulant resin and said goodbyes.A few outlanders whod finished commissions were leaving, and with them a tiny number of locals whod requested, and been granted, egress.Darling, are you weepy?said Kayliegh.I wasnt.Ill see you tomorrow, and maybe even the day after.And you can...But she knew that communication would be so difficult it would end.We hugged until she, at least, was a little teary, and laughing too, saying, You of all people, you must know why Im off, and I was saying, I know, you cow, Im so jealous!I could see her thinking, You chose, and it was true.Id been going to leave, until half a year before, until the last miab had descended, with the shocking news of what, who, was on the way.Even then Id told myself Id stick to my plan, head into the out when the next relief came.But it was no real revelation to me when at last the yawl had crossed the sky and left it howling, and Id realised I was going to stay.Scile, my husband, had probably suspected before I did that I would.When will they be here?asked the pilot.He meant the Hosts.Soon, I said, having no idea.It wasnt the Hosts I wanted to see.Ambassadors had arrived.People came close to them but they didnt get jostled.There was always space around them, a moat of respect.Outside, rain hit the windows.Id been able to ascertain nothing of what had been going on behind doors from any of my friends, any usual sources.Only the top bureaucrats and their advisors had met our most important, controversial newcomers, and I was hardly among them.People were glancing at the entrance.I smiled at the pilot.More Ambassadors were entering.I smiled at them, too, until they acknowledged me.The city Hosts would come before long, and the last of the new arrivals.The captain and the rest of the ships crew; the attachs; the consuls and researchers; perhaps a few late immigrants; and the point of all this, the impossible new Ambassador.Proem  THE IMMERSER    0.1  WHEN WE WERE YOUNG in Embassytown, we played a game with coins and coin sized crescent offcuts from a workshop.We always did so in the same place, by a particular house, beyond the rialto in a steep sloping backstreet of tenements, where advertisements turned in colours under the ivy.We played in the smothered light of those old screens, by a wall we christened for the tokens we played with.I remember spinning a heavy two sou piece on its edge and chanting as it went, turnabout, incline, pig snout, sunshine, until it wobbled and fell.The face that showed and the word Id reached when the motion stopped would combine to specify some reward or forfeit.I see myself clearly in wet spring and in summer, with a deuce in my hand, arguing over interpretations with other girls and with boys.We would never have played elsewhere, though that house, about which and about the inhabitant of which there were stories, could make us uneasy.Like all children we mapped our hometown carefully, urgently and idiosyncratically.In the market we were less interested in the stalls than in a high cubby left by lost bricks in a wall, which we always failed to reach.I disliked the enormous rock that marked the towns edge, which had been split and set again with mortar (for a purpose I did not yet know), and the library, the crenellations and armature of which felt unsafe to me.We all loved the college for the smooth plastone of its courtyard, on which tops and hovering toys travelled for metres.We were a hectic little tribe and constables would frequently challenge us, but we need only say, Its alright sir, madam, we have to just...and keep on.We would come fast down the steep and crowded grid of streets, past the houseless automa of Embassytown, with animals running among us or by us on low roofs, and while we might pause to climb trees and vines, we always eventually reached the interstice.At this edge of town the angles and piazzas of our home alleys were interrupted by at first a few uncanny geometries of Hosts buildings; then more and more, until our own were all replaced.Of course we would try to enter the Host city, where the streets changed their looks, and brick, cement or plasm walls surrendered to other more lively materials.I was sincere in these attempts but comforted that I knew Id fail.Wed compete, daring each other to go as far as we could, marking our limits.Were being chased by wolves, and we have to run, or Whoever goes furthests vizier, we said.I was the third best southgoer in my gang.In our usual spot, there was a Hostnest in fine alien colours tethered by creaking ropes of muscle to a stockade, that in some affectation the Hosts had fashioned like one of our wicker fences.Id creep up on it while my friends whistled from the crossroads.See images of me as a child and theres no surprise: my face then was just my face now not yet finished, the same suspicious mouth pinch or smile, the same squint of effort that sometimes got me laughed at later, and then as now I was rangy and restless.Id hold my breath and go forward on a lungful through where the airs mixedpast what was not quite a hard border but was still remarkably abrupt, a gaseous transition, breezes sculpted with nanotech particle machines and consummate atmosphere artistryto write Avice on the white wood.Once on a whim of bravado I patted the nests flesh anchor where it interwove the slats.It felt as taut as a gourd.I ran back, gasping, to my friends.You touched it.They said that with admiration.I stared at my hand.We would head north to where aeoli blew, and compare our achievements.A QUIET, well dressed man lived in the house where we played with coins.He was a source of local disquiet.Sometimes he came out while we were gathered.He would regard us and purse his lips in what might have been greeting or disapproval, before he turned and walked.We thought we understood what he was.We were wrong, of course, but wed picked up whatever we had from around the place and considered him broken and his presence inappropriate.Hey, I said more than once to my friends, when he emerged, pointing at him behind his back, hey.We would follow when we were brave, as he walked alleys of hedgerow toward the river or a market, or in the direction of the archive ruins or the Embassy.Twice I think one of us jeered nervously.Passersby instantly hushed us.Have some respect, an altoysterman told us firmly.He put down his basket of shellfish and aimed a quick cuff at Yohn, who had shouted.The vendor watched the old mans back.I remember suddenly knowing, though I didnt have the words to express it, that not all his anger was directed at us, that those tutting in our faces were disapproving, at least in part, of the man.Theyre not happy about where he lives, said that evenings shiftfather, Dad Berdan, when I told him about it.I told the story more than once, describing the man we had followed carefully and confusedly, asking the dad about him.I asked him why the neighbours werent happy and he smiled in embarrassment and kissed me good night.I stared out of my window and didnt sleep.I watched the stars and the moons, the glimmering of Wreck.I CAN DATE the following events precisely, as they occurred on the day after my birthday.I was melancholic in a way Im now amused by.It was late afternoon.It was the third sixteenth of September, a Dominday.I was sitting alone, reflecting on my age (absurd little Buddha!), spinning my birthday money by the coin wall.I heard a door open but I didnt look up, so it may have been seconds that the man from the house stood before me while I played.When I realised, I looked up at him in bewildered alarm.Girl, he said.He beckoned.Please come with me.I dont remember considering running.What could I do, it seemed, but obey?His house was astonishing.There was a long room full of dark colours, cluttered with furniture, screens and figurines.Things were moving, automa on their tasks.We had creepers on the walls of our nursery but nothing like these shining black leaved sinews in ogees and spirals so perfect they looked like prints.Paintings covered the walls, and plasmings, their movements altering as we entered.Information changed on screens in antique frames.Hand sized ghosts moved among potted plants on a trid like a mother of pearl games board.Your friend.The man pointed at his sofa.On it lay Yohn.I said his name.His booted feet were up on the upholstery, his eyes were closed.He was red and wheezing.I looked at the man, afraid that whatever hed done to Yohn, as he must have done, he would do to me.He did not meet my eyes, instead fussing with a bottle.They brought him to me, he said.He looked around, as if for inspiration on how to speak to me.Ive called the constables.He sat me on a stool by my barely breathing friend and held out a glass of cordial to me.I stared at it suspiciously until he drank from it himself, swallowed and showed me he had by sighing with his mouth open.He put the vessel in my hand.I looked at his neck, but I could not see a link.I sipped what he had given me.The constables are coming, he said.I heard you playing.I thought it might help him to have a friend with him.You could hold his hand.I put the glass down and did so.You could tell him youre here, tell him hell be alright.Yohn, its me, Avice.After a silence I patted Yohn on the shoulder.Im here.Youll be alright, Yohn.My concern was quite real.I looked up for more instructions, and the man shook his head and laughed.Just hold his hand then, he said.What happened, sir?I said.They found him.He went too far.Poor Yohn looked very sick.I knew what hed done.Yohn was the second best southgoer in our group.He couldnt compete with Simmon, the best of all, but Yohn could write his name on the picket fence several slats farther than I.  Over some weeks Id strained to hold my breath longer and longer, and my marks had been creeping closer to his.So he must have been secretly practising.Hed run too far from the breath of the aeoli.I could imagine him gasping, letting his mouth open and sucking in air with the sour bite of the interzone, trying to go back but stumbling with the toxins, the lack of clean oxygen.He might have been down, unconscious, breathing that nasty stew for minutes.They brought him to me, the man said again.I made a tiny noise as I suddenly noticed that, half hidden by a huge ficus, something was moving.I dont know how Id failed to see it.It was a Host.It stepped to the centre of the carpet.I stood immediately, out of the respect Id been taught and my childs fear.The Host came forward with its swaying grace, in complicated articulation.It looked at me, I think: I think the constellation of forking skin that was its lustreless eyes regarded me.It extended and reclenched a limb.I thought it was reaching for me.Its waiting to see the boys taken, the man said.If he gets better itll be because of our Host here.You should say thank you.I did so and the man smiled.He squatted beside me, put his hand on my shoulder.Together we looked up at the strangely moving presence.Little egg, he said, kindly.You know it cant hear you?Or, well...that it hears you but only as noise?But youre a good girl, polite.He gave me some inadequately sweet adult confection from a mantelpiece bowl.I crooned over Yohn, and not only because I was told to.I was scared.My poor friends skin didnt feel like skin, and his movements were troubling.The Host bobbed on its legs.At its feet shuffled a dog sized presence, its companion.The man looked up into what must be the Hosts face.Staring at it, he might have looked regretful, or I might be saying that because of things I later knew.The Host spoke.Of course Id seen its like many times.Some lived in the interstice where we dared ourselves to play.We sometimes found ourselves facing them, as they walked with crablike precision on whatever their tasks were, or even ran, with a gait that made them look as if they must fall, though they did not.We saw them tending the flesh walls of their nests, or what we thought of as their pets, those whispering companion animal things.We would quieten abruptly down in their presence and move away from them.We mimicked the careful politeness our shiftparents showed them.Our discomfort, like that of the adults we learned it from, outweighed any curiosity at the strange actions we might see the Hosts performing.We would hear them speak to each other in their precise tones, so almost like our voices.Later in our lives a few of us might understand some of what they said, but not yet, and never really me.Id never been so close to one of the Hosts.My fear for Yohn distracted me from all Id otherwise feel from this proximity to the thing, but I kept it in my sight, so it could not surprise me, then when it rocked closer to me I shied away abruptly and broke off whispering to my friend.They were not the only exoterres Id seen.There were exot inhabitants of Embassytowna few Kedis, a handful of Shurasi and othersbut with them, while there was strangeness of course there was never that abstraction, that sheer remove one felt from Hosts.One Shurasi shopkeeper would even joke with us, his accent bizarre but his humour clear.Later I understood that those immigrants were exclusively from species with which we shared conceptual models, according to various measures.Hosts, the indigenes, in whose city we had been graciously allowed to build Embassytown, were cool, incomprehensible presences.Powers like subaltern gods, who sometimes watched us as if we were interesting, curious dust; and who provided our biorigging, and to which the Ambassadors alone spoke.We were reminded often that we owed them courtesy.Pass them in the street and we would show the required respect, then run on giggling.Without my friends, though, I couldnt camouflage my fear with silliness.Its asking if the boyll be alright, the man said.He rubbed his mouth.Colloquially, something like, will he run later or will he cool?It wants to help.It has helped.It probably thinks me rude.He sighed.Or mentally ill.Because I wont answer it.It can see Im diminished.If your friend doesnt die itll be because it brought him here.The Hosts found him.I could tell the man was trying to speak gently to me.He seemed unpractised.They can come here but they know we cant leave.They know more or less what we need.He pointed at the Hosts pet.They had their engines breathe oxygen into him.Yohnll maybe be fine.The constablesll come soon.Your names Avice.Where do you live, Avice?I told him.Do you know my name?Id heard it of course.I was unsure of the etiquette of speaking it to him.Bren, I said.Bren.That isnt right.You understand that?You cant say my name.You might spell it, but you cant say it.But then I cant say my name either.Bren is as good as any of us can do.It...He looked at the Host, which nodded gravely.Now, it can say my name.But thats no good: it and I cant speak anymore.Why did they bring him to you, sir?His house was close to the interstice, to where Yohn had fallen, but hardly adjacent.They know me.They brought your friend to me because though as I say they know me to be lessened in some way they also recognise me.They speak and they must hope Ill answer them.Im...I must be...very confusing to them.He smiled.Its all foolishness, I know.Believe me I do know that.Do you know what I am, Avice?I nodded.Now, of course, I know that I had no idea what he was, and Im not sure he did either.The constables at last arrived with a medical team, and Brens room became an impromptu surgery.Yohn was intubated, drugged, monitored.Bren pulled me gently out of the experts way.We stood to one side, I, Bren and the Host, its animal tasting my feet with a tongue like a feather.A constable bowed to the Host, which moved its face in response.Thanks for helping your friend, Avice.Perhaps hell be fine.And Ill see you soon, Im sure.Turnaround, incline, piggy, sunshine?Bren smiled.While a constable ushered me out at last, Bren stood with the Host.It had wrapped him in a companionable limb.He did not pull away.They stood in polite silence, both looking at me.AT THE NURSERY they fussed over me.Even assured by the officer that Id done nothing wrong, the staffparents seemed a little suspicious about what Id got myself into.But they were decent, because they loved us.They could see I was in shock.How could I forget Yohns shaking figure?More, how could I forget being quite so close up to the Host, the sounds of its voice?I was haunted by what had been, without question, its precise attention on me.So somebody had drinks with Staff, today, did they?my shiftfather teased as he put me to bed.It was Dad Shemmi, my favourite.Later in the out I took mild interest in all the varieties of ways to be a family.I dont remember any particular jealousy I, or most other Embassytown children, felt at those of our shiftsiblings whose blood parents at times visited them: it wasnt in particular our norm there.I never looked into it, but I wondered, in later life, whether our shift and nursery system continued social practices of Embassytowns founders (Bremen has for a long time been relaxed about including a variety of mores in its sphere of governance), or if it had been thrown up a little later.Perhaps in vague social evolutionary sympathy with the institutional raising of our Ambassadors.No matter.You heard terrible stories from the nurseries from time to time, yes, but then in the out I heard bad stories too, about people raised by those whod birthed them.On Embassytown we all had our favourites and those we were more scared of, those whose on duty weeks we relished and those not, those wed go to for comfort, those for advice, those wed steal from, and so on; but our shiftparents were good people.Shemmi I loved the most.Why do the people not like Mr.Bren living there?Not Mr.Bren, darling, just Bren.They, some of them, dont think its right for him to live like that, in town.What do you think?He paused.I think theyre right.I think its...unseemly.There are places for the cleaved.Id heard that word before, from Dad Berdan.Retreats just for them, so...Its ugly to see, Avvy.Hes a funny one.Grumpy old sod.Poor man.But it isnt good to see.That kind of wound.Its disgusting, some of my friends later said.Theyd learnt this attitude from less liberal shiftparents.Nasty old cripple should go to the sanatorium.Leave him alone, Id say.He saved Yohn.Yohn recovered.His experience didnt stop our game.I went a little farther, a little farther over weeks, but I never reached Yohns marks.The fruits of his dangerous experiment, a last mark, was metres beyond any of his others, the initial letter of his name in a terrible hand.I fainted there, he would tell us.I nearly died.After his accident he was never able to go nearly so far again.He remained the second best because of his history, but I could beat him now.How do I spell Brens name?I asked Dad Shemmi, and he showed me.Bren, he said, running his finger along the word: seven letters; four he sounded; three he could not.0.2  WHEN I WAS seven years old I left Embassytown.Kissed my shiftparents and siblings goodbye.I returned when I was eleven: married; not rich but with savings and a bit of property; knowing a little of how to fight, how to obey orders, how and when to disobey them; and how to immerse.Id become fair to good at several things, though I excelled, I thought, at only one.It wasnt violence.Thats an everyday risk of port life, and over my time away Id lost only a few more fights than Id won.I look stronger than I am, I was always quickish, and like many middling scrappers Id become good at insinuating more skill than I had.I could avoid confrontations without obvious cowardice.I was bad at money but had amassed some.I couldnt claim that marriage was my real skill, but I was better at it than many.Id had two previous husbands and a wife.Id lost them to changes of predilection, without rancouras I say, I wasnt bad at marriage.Scile was my fourth spouse.As an immerser I progressed to the ranks I aspired tothose that granted me a certain cachet and income while keeping me from fundamental responsibilities.This is what I excelled at: the life technique of aggregated skill, luck, laziness and chutzpah that we call floaking.Immersers, I think, created the term.Everyone has some floaker in them.Theres a devil on your shoulder.Not everyone crewing aspires to master the techniquethere are those who want to captain or explorebut for most, floaking is indispensable.Some people think it mere indolence but its a more active and nuanced technique than that.Floakers arent afraid of effort: many crew work very hard to get shipboard in the first place.I did.When I think of my age I think in years, still, even after all this time and travel.Its bad form, and ship life should have cured me of it.Years?one of my first officers shouted at me.I dont give two shits about whatever your pisspot homes sidereal shenanigans are, I want to know how old you are.Answer in hours.Answer in subjective hours: no officer cares if youve slowed any compared to your pisspot home.No one cares which of the countless year lengths you grew up with.So, when I was about 170 kilohours old I left Embassytown.I returned when I was 266Kh, married, with savings, having learnt a few things.I was about 158 kilohours old when I learnt that I could immerse.I knew then what Id do, and I did it.I answer in subjective hours; I have to bear objective hours vaguely in mind; I think in the years of my birth home, which was itself dictated to by the schedules of another place.None of this has anything to do with Terre.I once met a junior immerser from some self hating backwater who reckoned in what he called earth years, the risible fool.I asked him if hed been to the place by the calendar of which he lived.Of course hed no more idea of where it was than I.    AS IVE GROWN OLDER Ive become conscious of how unsurprising I am.What happened to me didnt happen to many Embassytownersthats surely the pointbut the story of its happening is classic.I was born in a place that I thought for thousands of hours was enough of a universe.Then I knew quite suddenly that it was not, but that I wouldnt be able to leave; and then I could leave.You hear the same all over the place, and not only among the human.Heres another memory.We used to play at immersing, running up behind each other in a little Im invisible crouch, then shouting Emerge!and grabbing.We knew very little about immersion, and that play acting was, I would come to learn, not much more inaccurate than most adult descriptions of the immer.Irregularly throughout my youth, scheduled between incoming ships, miabs would arrive.Uncrewed little boxes full of oddments, steered by ware.Plenty were lost en route: became hazards forever, I later learned, in variously strange corroded forms, in the immer theyd been built to travel.But most reached us.As I got older my excitement at those arrivals became coloured by frustration, envy of them, until I realised I would, in fact, get out into the out.They became hints, then: little whispers.When I was four and a half years old I saw a train hauling a just touched down miab through Embassytown.Like most children and many adults, I always wanted to witness their arrival.There was a little gang of us there from the nursery, watched and lightly corralled by Mum Quiller, I think it was, and we ourselves roughly looked out for our much younger shiftfriends.We were able to lean up over the railings mostly uninterrupted and chatter at each other and the arrival.As always the miab was laid on a colossal flatbed, and the biorigged locomotor that hauled it through the wide cut of Embassytowns industrial rails was heaving, putting out temporary muscular legs to strain along with its engine.The miab on its back was bigger than my nurserys hall.A very real container, snub bullet shaped, moving through light rain.Its surface sheened with saft that evanesced out from its crystal shielding in threads that degraded to nothing.The authorities were irresponsible, I know now, not to have waited for that immer stained surface to calm.This wasnt the first miab theyd brought in still damp from its journey.I saw a building dragged.Thats what it looked like.A big train wheezing with effort, its enginarii cajoling it through a gash.The enormous room was tugged uphill towards the Ambassadors castle, surrounded by Embassytowners, cheering and waving ribbons.It had an escort of centaurs, men and women perched at the front of quadruped biorigged conveyances.Some of the towns few exots stood by their Terre friends: Kedis frills rose and flushed colours, Shurasi and Pannegetch made their sounds.There were automa in the crowd: some staggering boxes, some with persuasive enough Turingware that they seemed enthusiastic participants.Inside the unmanned vessel would be cargo, presents to us from Dagostin and perhaps beyond, import things we coveted, bookware and books, newsware, rare foods, tech, letters.The craft itself would be cannibalised, too.Id sent things out in return myself, yearly, when our own much smaller miabs were dispatched.They contained hardy goods and the paraphernalia of official duties (all carefully copied before dispatchno one would assume any miab would reach its destination), but a little space was retained for children to correspond with pen pal schools in the out.Miab, miab, message in a bottle!Mum Berwick would sing as she gathered our letters up.Dear Class 7, Bowchurch High, Charo City, Bremen, Dagostin, I remember writing.I wish that I could come with my letter to visit you.Brief catch up epistolary flurries every rare often.The miab passed by one of the waterways we called rivers, which are small canals, under Stilt Bridge.I remember that there were Hosts there, with a delegation of Embassy Staff, looking down through the bridges coloured glass portals, flanked by our security on biorigged mount machines.It was out of my sight when the stowaway emerged from the miab, but Ive seen recordings.The tracks were overlooked by tenements on the east side and the animal gardens on the west when cracking first became audible.Had it been a kilometre farther, into the rookeries and under the bridgepaths in the Embassys close vicinity, it would have gone much worse.You can see from the newsloads that some in the crowd knew what was happening.There were shouts as the noise grew, people trying to warn people.Some of those who understood simply ran.Us kids mostly just stood I think, though Mum Quiller would have done her best to get us out of there.Theres the sound of the miabs ceramic case straining in anti Newtonian ways.People are peering over the railings to see; more and more are getting out of there.The miab splits, sending blades of hull matter viciously airborne.Something from the immer comes out.Taxonomy is imprecise.Most experts agree that what emerged on that day was a minor manifestation, one Id later learn to call a stichling.It was an insinuation at first, composing itself of angles and shadows.It accreted itself from its surrounds, manifesting in the transient.The bricks, plastone and concrete of buildings, the energy of the cages and the flesh of the captive animals from the gardens spilled toward and into the swimming thing, against physics.They substanced it.Houses were unroofed as their slates dripped sideways into a presence growing every moment more physical, more suited to this realness.IT WAS PUT DOWN quickly.They hammered it with sometimes guns, that violently assert the manchmal, this stuff, our everyday, against the always of the immer.It was banished or dispatched after minutes of shrieking.Thankfully no Hosts were harmed.But the emergence left scores of others dead.Some were killed in the explosion; some were lessened, had partially poured away.From then on, when retrieving miabs, Staff obeyed the protocols of care that they had been letting slip.Our trids showed repeated debates, fury and angst.Whoever it was in Staff who was sacked in disgrace was a scapegoat for the system.A young, dashingly ill disciplined Ambassador DalTon more or less asserted that on cam, in anger, which I remember the parents talking about.Dad Noor even told me the disaster would be the end of the pomp of arrival.He was wrong about this, of course.He was always a lugubrious man.Of course my friends and I were obsessed with the tragedy.Within a very short time we were playing it as a game, making immer bubbling and cracking shellcase noises, firing finger guns and sticks at those of us temporarily monsters.I conceived of the stichling as some sort of slayed dragon.THERES A STORY told, sort of a traditional view, that immersers never remember their childhoods.Thats obviously not true.People say it as a way to stress the strangeness of the immer; the implication being that theres something in that foundational altreality that plays buggery with human minds.(Which it can do, certainly, but not like that. )Its not true, but it is the case that I, and most of the immersers Ive known, have casual, or vague, or discombobulated memories of when we were small.I dont think its a mystery: I think its a corollary of our mindsets, the way we think, those of us who want to go into the out.I recall episodes very well, but episodes, not a timeline.The most relevant times, the definitional ones.The rest of its disorganised in my head, and mostly I dont mind.Here: one other time in my childhood, I was in the company of Hosts.One morning in the third monthling of July I was called to a meeting.It was Dad Shemmi they sent to fetch me.He squeezed my shoulder as he pointed me in to one of the nurserys scruffy paperwork and datspace filled offices.It was Mum Solfers room, and Id not been in it before.Mostly Terretech, though a boxy biorigged bin was quietly eating her rubbish.Solfer was older, kind, distracted, knew me by name, which she did not all my shiftsiblings.She beckoned me, obviously uneasy.She stood, glanced around as if for a sofa, which the room was without, sat again.Behind her desk with hernot unamusing, in retrospect, it was smallish and too cramped for themwas Dad Renshaw, a relatively new, thoughtful and teacherly shiftfather, who smiled at me; and to my astonishment the third person waiting for me was Bren.It had been almost a year, nearly 25Kh, since Yohns accident, since I or any of us had returned to that house.Id grown, of course, and more than many of my siblings, but as soon as I entered, Bren smiled recognition.He looked unchanged.They might have been the same clothes he had on as before.Mum shifted.Though she sat with the others on one side of the desk while I, on the stiffly adult chair to which she directed me, was on the other, the way she moved her eyebrows at me I felt suddenly that she and I were together in whatever this oddness was.Id be paid for this, she said (an uploading of no little size, it turned out); it was quite safe; it was an honour.She didnt make very much sense.Dad Renshaw gently interrupted her.He turned to Bren and motioned for him to speak.Youre needed, Bren said to me.Thats all this is.He opened his hands palm up, as if their emptiness were evidence of something.The Hosts need you and again for some reason its ended up going through me.Theyre trying to prepare something.Theyre having a debate.A few of them are convinced they can make their point clearly by...by comparison.He watched to see if I followed.Theyve...sort of thought of one.But the events it describes havent happened.Do you understand what that means?They want to make it speakable.So they need to organise it.Quite precisely.It involves a human girl.He smiled.You see why I asked for you.I suppose he didnt know any other children.Bren smiled at the way my mouth was moving.You...want me to...perform a simile?I said at last.Its an honour!Dad Renshaw said.It is an honour, Bren said.I can see you know that.Perform?He wagged his head in a sort of well, yes and no way.I wont tell you lies.Itll hurt.And it wont be nice.But I promise youll be alright.I promise.He leaned toward me.Therell be money in it for you, like your Mum was saying.And.Also.Youll have the thanks of the Staff.And the Ambassadors.Renshaw glanced up.I wasnt so young as to not know what that gratitude was worth.Id an idea of what I hoped to do when I was old enough, by then, and the goodwill of Staff was something I wanted very much.I ALSO SAID YES to the request because I thought it would take me into the Host city.It did not.The Hosts came to us, to a part of town to which Id hardly ever been.I was taken there in a corvidmy first flight, but I was too nervous to enjoy it escorted not by constables but Embassy SecStaff, their bodies subtly gnarled with augmens and tecs.Bren escorted me, with no one else, no shiftparents, though he had no official role in Embassytown.(I didnt know that then. )That was a time, though, before he withdrew from the last of such informal Staff like roles.He tried to be kind to me.I remember we skirted Embassytowns edges and I saw for the first time the scale of the enormous throats that delivered biorigging and supplies to us.They flexed, wet and warm ends of siphons extending kilometres beyond our boundaries.I saw other craft over the city: some biorigged, some old Terretech, some chimerical.We came down in a neglected quarter that no one had been bothered to take off grid.Though it was almost empty its streets were lit by lifelong neon and trid spectres dancing in midair, announcing restaurants long since closed.In the ruins of one such, Hosts were waiting.Their simile, I had been warned, required me to be alone with them, so Bren gave me into their authority.He shook his head at me as he did, as if we were agreeing that something was a little absurd.He whispered that it wouldnt be long, and that he would be waiting.WHAT OCCURRED in that crumbling once dining room wasnt by any means the worst thing Ive ever suffered, or the most painful, or the most disgusting.It was quite bearable.It was, however, the least comprehensible event that had or has ever happened to me.I was surprised how much that upset me.For a long time the Hosts didnt pay attention to me, but performed precise mimes.They raised their giftwings, they stepped forward and back.I could smell their sweet smell.I was frightened.Id been prepared: it was imperative for the sake of the simile that I act my part perfectly.They spoke.I understood only the very basics of what I heard, could pick out an occasional word.I listened for the overlapping whisper Id been told meant she, and when I heard it I came forward and did what they wanted.I know now to call what I did then disassociating.I watched it all, myself included.I was impatient for it to finish; I felt nothing growing, no special connection between me and the Hosts.I was only watching.While we performed the actions that were necessary, that would allow them to speak their analogy, I thought of Bren.He could of course no longer speak to the Hosts.What was happening had been organised by the Embassy, and I supposed Brens erstwhile colleagues, the Ambassadors, must have been glad for him to help organise it.I wonder if they were giving him something to do.After I was done, in the youthmall, my friends demanded all details.We were roughnecks like most Embassytowner children are.You were with the Hosts?Thats import, Avvy!Swear?Say it like a Host?Say it like a Host, I said, appropriately solemn for the oath.No way.What did they do?I showed my bruises.I both did and didnt want to talk about it.Eventually I enjoyed the telling and embellishing of it.It gave me status for days.Other consequences were more important.Two days later, Dad Renshaw escorted me to Brens house.It was the first time Id been there since Yohns accident.Bren smiled and welcomed me, and there within I met my first Ambassadors.Their clothes were the most beautiful Id seen.Their links glinted, the lights on them stuttering in time to the fields they generated.I was cowed.There were three of them, and the room was crowded.The more so as, behind them, moving side to side, whispering to Bren or one or other Ambassador, was an autom, computer in segmented body, the womans face it gave itself animated as it spoke.I could see the Ambassadors trying to be warm to me, a child, as Bren had tried, without having any practise at it.An older woman said, Avice Benner Cho, is it?in an amazing, grand voice.Come in.Sit.We wanted to thank you.We think you should hear how youve been canonised.The Ambassadors spoke to me in the language of our Hosts.They spoke me: they said me.They warned me that the literal translation of the simile would be inadequate and misleading.There was a human girl who in pain ate what was given her in an old room built for eating in which eating had not happened for a time.Itll be shortened with use, Bren told me.Soon theyll be saying youre a girl ate what was given her.What does it mean, sirs, maams?They shook their heads, they moued.Its not really important, Avice, one of them said.She whispered to the computer and I saw the created face nod.And it wouldnt be accurate anyway.I asked again with another formulation, but they would say nothing more about it.They kept congratulating me on being in Language.Twice during the rest of my adolescence I heard myself, my simile, spoken: once by an Ambassador, once by a Host.Years, thousands of hours after I acted it, I finally had it sort of explained to me.It was a crude rendering, of course, but it is I think more or less an expression intended to invoke surprise and irony, a kind of resentful fatalism.I didnt speak to Bren again the whole rest of my childhood and youth, but I found out he visited my shiftparents at least one other time.Im sure it was my help with the simile, and Brens vague patronage, that helped get me past the exam board.I worked hard but was never an intellectual.I had what was needed for immersion, but no more than several others did, and less than some who didnt pass.Very few cartas were granted, to civilians, or those of us with the aptitudes to traverse the immer out of sopor.There was no obvious reason that a few months later, after those tests, even with my facilities acknowledged, I should have been given, as I was, rights to de world, into the out.0.3  EACH SCHOOL YEAR, the second monthling of December was given over to assessments.Most investigated what wed learnt from our lessons; a few others checked more recherche abilities.Not many of us scored particularly highly in these latter, in the various flairs prized elsewhere, in the out.In Embassytown we started from the wrong stock, we were told: we had the wrong mutagens, the wrong equipment, a lack of aspiration.Many children didnt even sit the more arcane exams, but I was encouraged to.Which I suppose means my teachers and shiftparents had seen something in me.I did perfectly fine in most things; well in rhetoric and some performative elements of literature, which pleased me, and in readings of poetry.But what I stood out in, it transpired, without knowing what it was I was doing, were certain activities the purposes of which I couldnt divine.I stared at a query screen of bizarre plasmings.I had to react to them in various ways.It took about an hour and it was well designed, like a game, so I wasnt bored.I proceeded to other tasks, none testing knowledge, but reactions, intuitions, inner ear control, nervousness.What they gauged was potential skill at immersing.The woman who ran the sessions, young and chic in smart clothes borrowed, bartered or begged from one of the Bremeni staff, in fashion in the out, went over my results with me, and told me what they meant.I could see she was not unimpressed.She stressed to me, not cruelly but to avoid any later upset, that this concluded nothing and was just stage one of many.But I knew as she explained this that I would become an immerser, and I did.Id only started to feel the smallness of Embassytown by then, to grumble in claustrophobia, but with her readings came impatience.I finagled, when I was old enough, invitations to Arrival Balls, and hobnobbed with women and men from the out.I enjoyed and envied the seeming insouciance with which they mentioned countries on other planets.It was only kilohours or years later that I really understood how not inevitable my trajectory had been.That many students with more aptitude than me hadnt succeeded; that I truly might have failed to leave.My story was the cliche, but theirs was by far the more common, the more true.That contingency had made me feel sick, then, as if I might fail still, even though I was out.Even people whove never immersed think they know more or less, they might grantwhat the immer is.They dont.I had this argument once with Scile.It was the second conversation we ever had (the first was about language).He started in with his opinions, and I told him I wasnt interested in hearing what the landstuck might think about immer.We lay in bed and he teased me as I went on about his ignorance.What are you talking about?he said.You dont even believe what youre saying; youre too smart for this.Youre just spouting immerser bullshit.I could do this stuff in my sleep.No one understands it like us, not the scientists, not the politicians, not the bloody public!Its your favourite story, this.Keeps everyone out.He made me laugh with his impression.Still, I told him, still: the immer was indescribable.But he wouldnt let me have that either.Youre fooling no one with this stuff.You think I havent listened to how you talk?I know, I know, youre not one for the gab, youre just a floaker, blah blah.As if you dont read your poetry, as if you take language for granted.He shook his head.Anyway, youll do me out of a job with talk like that.Its beyond words, indeed.Theres no such thing.I put my hand over his mouth.That was just how it was, I told him.Now, granted, he continued through my fingers, performing the same teacherly tone, now muffled, words cant actually be referents, that I grant you, theres the tragedy of language, but our asymptotic efforts at deploying them arent nothing, either.Hush up, you, I told him.Its all true, I said, I say it like a Host.Well then, he said, I withdraw, in the face of truth.Id studied the immer a long time, but my first moment of immersion had been as impossible to describe as I insisted.With the handful of other carta passed new crew and emigrants, and Bremeni Embassy Staff whod finished their commissions, Id come by ketch to my vessel.My first commission was with the Wasp of Kolkata.It was quasi autonomous, a cityship, immersing under the flag of itself, subcontracted by Dagostin for this run.I remember I stood with all the other greenhorns in the crows nest, Arieka a wall across the sky through which we moved, with beautiful care, toward our immersion point.Somewhere beneath the worlds static seeming cloud was Embassytown.The steersperson took us close to Wreck.It was hard to see.It looked at first like lines drawn across space, then was briefly, shabbily corporeal.It ebbed back and forth in solidity.It was many hundreds of metres across.It rotated, all its extrusions moving, each on its own schedule, its coagulated teardrops and girder  filigree shape spinning complexly.Wrecks architecture was roughly similar to Wasps, but it was antiquated, and it seemed many times our dimensions.It was like an original of which we were a scale model, until abruptly it altered its planes and became small or far off.Occasionally it wasnt there, and sometimes only just.Officers, augmens glimmering under their skins, reminded us first timers what it was we were about to do, of the dangers of the immer.This, Wreck, showed that and why Arieka was an outpost, so hard to reach, so underdeveloped, satelliteless after that first catastrophe.I would have been professional.Yes I was about to immerse for the first time, but I would have done anything I was ordered and I think Id have done it well.But the officers remembered what it was like to be a rookie, and they had us, the handful of new immersers, at a viewing place.Where we could react as we had to, the skills wed practised never a guarantee that the first time wouldnt sicken you.Where we could take a moment with our awe and experience it however we experienced it.There are currents and storm fronts in the immer.There are in the immer stretches it takes tremendous skill and time to cross.Those were among the techniques I now knew, along with the somatic control, the mantric thoughtfulness and instrumentalised matter offactness that made me an immerser, allowed immersers to stay conscious and intentional when we immersed.On a map, its not so many billions of kilometres from Dagostin or other hubs.But those Euclidian star charts are used only by cosmologists, by some exoterres whose physics we cant work, by religious nomads adrift at excruciating sublux pace.I was scandalised to first see themmaps were discouraged on Embassytownand anyway such charts are irrelevant to travellers like me.Look instead at a map of the immer.Such a big and tidal quiddity.Pull it up, rotate it, check its projections.Examine that light phantom every way you can, and even allowing that its a flat or trid rendering of a topos which rebels against our accounting, the situation is visibly different.The immers reaches dont correspond at all to the dimensions of the manchmal, this space where we live.The best we can do is say that the immer underlies or overlies, infuses, is a foundation, is langue of which our actuality is a parole, and so on.Here in the everyday, in light decades and petametres, Dagostin is vastly more distant from Tarsk and Hodgsons than from Arieka.But in the immer, Dagostin to Tarsk is a few hundred hours on a prevailing wind; Hodgsons is in the centre of sedate and crowded deeps; and Arieka is very far from anything.Its beyond a convulsion where violent streams of immer roll against each other, where there are shallows, dangerous juts and matterbanks of everyday space in the always.It sits alone at the edge of known immer, so far as the immer can be known.Without expertise and bravery, and the skill of the immersers, no one could get to my world.The stringency of the final exams Id sat makes sense when you see those charts.Raw aptitude was hardly enough.Certainly there were politics of exclusion, too: of course Bremen wanted to keep careful control of us Embassytowners; but only the most skilled crew could safely come to Arieka in any case, or could leave it.Some of us were socketed to link us to ship routines, and immerware and augmens helped; but none of that was enough to make an immerser.The way the officers explained it made it seem as if the ruins of the Pionier, which I had to stop calling Wreck now it was no longer a star to me but a coffin for colleagues, were a warning against carelessness.As a parable that was unfair.The Pionier had not been so horribly beached between states by officers or crew underestimating the immer: it was precisely care and respectful exploration that had destroyed it.Like other vessels across various tracta cognita in the early hours of it all, it had been lured.By what it had thought a message, an invitation.When immernauts first breached the meniscus of everyday space, among the many phenomena that had astounded them was the fact that, even on their crude instruments, they had received signals, from somewhere in the ur space.Regular and resonant, clear evidence of sentience.They had tried to go to the sources.For a long time theyd thought it was lack of skill, neophyte immersion, that kept bringing their ships to disaster on those searches.Again and again they wrecked, bursting ruinously half out of the immer into the corporeal manchmal.The Pionier was a casualty of that time, before explorers had understood that the pulses were put out by lighthouses.They were not invitations.What the ships had striven toward were warnings to stay away.SO THERE ARE lighthouses throughout the immer.Not every dangerous zone is marked by the beacons, but many are.They are, it seems, at least as old as this universe, which isnt the first theres been.The prayer so often muttered before immersion is one of thanks to those unknown who placed them.Gracious Pharotekton watch over us now.I didnt see the Ariekene Pharos that first time out, but thousands of hours later.To be precise Ive never seen it, of course, nor could I; that would require light and reflection and other physics that are meaningless there.But Ive seen representations, rendered by ships windows.The ware in those portholes depicts the immer and everything in it in terms useful to crew.Ive seen pharoes like complex clots, like crosshatching, contoured and shaped into information.When I returned to Embassytown, the captain, in what I think was a gift to me, had the screens run tropeware: as we approached gnarls of immer into the dangerous buffetings that surround Arieka, I saw a beam in the fractal black, a pointing arm of light as a lamp seemed to turn.And when the pharos came into view, floating in the middle of the unplace, it was a brick lighthouse topped with bronze and glass.I TOLD HIM about these things when I met him, and Scile, who would later be my husband, wanted me to describe my first immersion.Hed been through immer, of coursehe wasnt indigene to the world on which we slept togetherbut as a passenger of modest income and no particular immunities, hed remained in sopor.Though he had, he told me, once paid to be woken a little early, so he could experience immersion.(Id heard of people doing that.A crew shouldnt allow it, and surely only would in shallow shallows. )Scile had been violently immersick.What could I tell him?Protected by the everyday field, that first time the Wasp splashed through and immersed it wasnt even as if I had immer against my skin.Truth was you could say Id felt more directly connected to the immer as a trainee in Embassytown, when Id socketed to a scope that worked on the immer like the flat bottom of a glass pushed down on water.Id seen right into it then, up close, and that had changed me.Dont ask me to describe that, Id have said.The Wasp went in hard.I was inexperienced but I could easily grit through the nausea that, despite my training, I felt.Even cosseted in that manchmal field I felt all the tugs of strange velocity, as we moved in what were not really directions, and the misleading gravity bubble wed brought with us did its best.But I was much too anxious not to disgrace myself to give in to awe.That came only later, after our indulgence was ended, after wed been put to initial frantic duties and then after those were finished, when wed reached a cruising depth of immersion.What we do, what we can doimmersersis not just keep ourselves stable, sentient and healthy in the immer, stay able to walk and think, eat, defecate, obey and give orders, make decisions, judge immerstuff, the paradata that approximate distances and conditions, without being crippled with always sick.Though thats not nothing.It isnt only that we have, some say (and some refute), a certain flatness of imagination that keeps the immer from basilisking us out of usefulness.Weve learnt its caprices, to travel it, but knowledge can always be learnt.Ships while still in the manchmalTerre ones, I mean, Ive never been on any exot vessels that abjure the immer and I know nothing about the ways they moveare heavy boxes full of people and stuff.Immerse, into the immer, where the translations of their ungainly lines have purpose, and theyre gestalts of which were part, each of us a function.Yes, were a crew working together like any crew, but more.The engines take us out of the sometimes, but its we who do the taking, too; its we who push the ship as well as it that pulls us.Its us tacking and involuting through the ur space, the shifts in it we call tides.Civilians, even those awake not puking or weeping, cant do that.The fact is a lot of the bullshit we tell you about the immer is true.Were still playing you, when we tell you: the story dramatises, even without lying.This is the third universe, I told Scile.Thereve been two others before this.Right?I didnt know how much civilians knew: this stuff had become my common sense.Each one was born different.It had its own lawsin the first one they reckon light was about twice as fast as it is here now.Each one was born and grew and got old and collapsed.Three different sometimes.But below all that, or around it, or whatever, theres only ever been one immer, one always.He did know all that, it turned out.But to be told these everyday facts by an immerser made them something new, and he listened like a boy.WE WERE in a bad hotel on the outskirts of Pellucias, a small city popular with tourists because of the gorgeous magmafalls it straddles.Its the capital of a small country on a world the name of which I dont remember.In the everyday, its not in our galaxy, its off somewhere light aeons away, but it and Dagostin are close neighbours via the immer.By then I was seasoned enough.Id been to many places.I was between commissions, when I met Scile, spending a couple of local weeks on self granted shore leave before I went for another job.I was picking up rumoursof new immertech, exploration, dubious missions.The hotel bar was full of immersers and other port life, travellers recovering, and, this time, academics.I was pretty familiar with all but the last of these types.In the lobby was an ad for a course in The Healing Power of Story, at which I made rude noises.A trid of turning and altering words floated the corridors, welcoming guests to the inaugural meeting of the Gold and Silver Circuits Board; to a convocation of Shurasi philosopher bureaucrats; to CHEL, the Conference of Human Exoterre Linguists.I was drunk in the bar with a bunch of temporary stopover friends, all now thoroughly hazy memories.We were being obnoxious.I went from half heartedly flirting with a bartender to mocking a table of scholars from CHEL, no less drunk or boisterous than we.Wed eavesdropped on them, then told them with immerser swagger that they didnt know anything about life or even languages in the out, and so on.Go on then, ask me something, I said to Scile.That was the first thing I ever said to him.I know exactly how Id have looked: leaning back in my high chair, turned so resting my back against the bar top, my head back so I could look down at him.I was surely pointing at him with both hands and smiling a bit pinch mouthed so as to not yet give him any satisfaction.Scile was the least gone at his table, and he was refereeing the teasing on both sides.I know all about weird languages, I told him.More than any of you buggers.Im from Embassytown.When he believed me, Ive never seen a man so astonished, so delighted.He didnt stop playing but he looked at me very differently, the more when he discovered none of my companions were my compatriots.I was the only Embassytowner, and Scile loved it.It wasnt just his attention I liked: I was pleased with how this compact, tough looking guy fenced with me, and kept everyone raucously amused while asking questions with actual content.We stumbled off after a while and spent a night and a day trying to enjoy sex together, sleeping, trying again, several times, with good humoured lack of success.After that over breakfast he badgered and blandished and begged me; and I, pretending disdain and having a lovely time, acquiesced, and let him take me, tired but, as I teased him, not sore enough, to the conference.He presented me to his colleagues.The CHEL was for the Terre study of all exot languages, but it was those generally considered most strange that fascinated its members.I saw slapdash temporary trids advertising sessions on cross cultural chromatophore signalling, on touch communication among the unseeing Burdhan, and on me.Im working in Homash.Do you know it?said one young woman to me, apropos of nothing.She was very happy when I told her no.They speak by regurgitation.Pellets embedded with enzymes in different combinations are sentences, which their interlocutors eat.I noticed my own trid in the background.Embassytowner guest!On life among the Ariekei.Thats wrong, I told the conference organisers, theyre Hosts.But they told me: Only to you.Sciles colleagues were eager to talk to me: no one there had met Embassytowners before.Nor Hosts, of course.Theyre still quarantined, I told them, but in any case theyve never asked about coming out.We dont even know if they could take immersion.I was willing to be a curio but I disappointed them.Id warned Scile I would.The discussion became vague and sociological when they realised that I wouldnt be able to tell them almost anything about Language.I hardly understand any, I said.We only learn a tiny bit, except Staff and Ambassadors.One participant pulled up some recordings of Hosts speaking, and ran through some vocabulary.I was pleased to be able to nuance a couple of the definitions, but honestly there were at least two people in the room who understood Language better than I did.Instead I told them stories of life in the outpost.They didnt know about the aeoli, the air sculpting that kept a breathable dome over Embassytown.A few had seen some bits of exported biorigging, but I could talk them through the out of date trids they had of the vaster infrastructure, the herds of houses, timelapse of a young bridge maturing from its pontoon cell to link city regions for no reasons I could give.Scile asked me about religion, and I told him that so far as I knew the Hosts had none.I mentioned the Festivals of Lies.Scile was not the only one who wanted to pursue that.But I thought they couldnt, someone said.Thats sort of the point, I said.To strive for the impossible.Whatre they like, those festivals?I laughed and said Id no clue, had never been to one, of course, had never been into the Host city.They began to debate Language among themselves.Wondering how to repay their hospitality in anecdote, I told what had happened to me in the abandoned restaurant.They were attentive all over again.Scile stared with his manic precision.You were in a simile?they said.I am a simile, I said.Youre a story?I was glad to be able to give Scile something.He and his colleagues were more excited at my having been similed than I was.SOMETIMES I teased Scile that he only wanted me for my Hosts language, or because Im part of a vocabulary.Hed finished the bulk of his research.It was a comparative study of a particular set of phonemes, in several different languagesand not all of one species, or one world, which made little sense to me.What are you looking for?I said.Oh, secrets, he said.You know.Essences.Inherentnesses.Bravo on that ugly word.And?And there arent any.Mmm, I said.Awkward.Thats defeatist talk.Ill cobble something together.A scholar can never let mere wrongness get in the way of the theory.Bravo again.I toasted him.We stayed together in that hotel much longer than either of us had planned, and then I, having no plans and no commission, sought work on the vessel taking him a trade route home.I was experienced and well referenced, and getting the job wasnt hard.It was only a short trip, 400 hours or somesuch.When I realised how bad was Sciles reaction to immersion I was very touched that he chose not to travel in sopor that first time together.It was a pointless gesturehe endured my shifts in lonely nausea, and despite meds could hardly even speak to me when I was off duty.But even irritated at his condition, I was touched.From what I gathered, it wouldnt have taken very much for him to tidy up his last few chapters, the charts, sound files and trids.But Scile suddenly announced to me that he was not going to hand in his thesis.Youve done all that work and you wont jump the last hoop?I said.Sod it, he said, flamboyantly unconcerned.He made me laugh.The revolution stalled!My poor failed radical.Yeah.Well.I was bored.But, hold on, I tried to say, more or less, but are you serious?Surely it would be worth  Its done, its old news, forget it.I have other research projects anyway, simile.What are you like?He bowed at that bad joke, clicked his fingers and moved us, thematically, on.He kept asking about Embassytown.His intensity was exciting, but he diluted it with enough self mockery that I believed his sometimes obsessive demeanour was partly performance.We didnt stay long in his parochial university town.He said hed follow me and pester me until I gave in and took him I knew where.I didnt believe any of this, but when I got my next commission he took transit with me, as a passenger.Once on that trip, when we were in shallow, calm immer, I brought Scile out of sopor to see a school of the immer predators we call hai.Ive spoken to captains and scientists who dont believe them to be anything like life, only aggregates of immer, their attacks and jackknife precision just the jostles of an immer chaos in which our manchmal brains cant learn to see the deep random.Myself, Ive always thought them monsters.Scile, fortified with drugs, and I watched our assertion charges shake the immer and send the hai darting.When we emerged wherever we emerged, wherever our vessel had delivery or pickup, Scile would register at local libraries, picking at old research and starting his new project.Where there were sights we saw them.We shared beds but fairly quickly we gave up on sex.He learnt languages wherever we were, with his ferocious concentration, slang if he already knew the formal vocabulary.Id travelled far more than he had, but I spoke and read only Anglo Ubiq.I was pleased by his company, often amused, always interested.I tested him, taking jobs that hauled us through immer for hundreds of hours at a time, nothing cruelly long but long enough.He finally passed, according to my unclear emotional accounting, when I realised that I wasnt only watching to see if hed stay, but was hoping he wouldnt leave.We were married on Dagostin, in Bremen, in Charo City, to where Id sent my childish letters.I told myself, and it was true, that it was important for me to emerge in my capital port sometimes.Even at the dragged out pace of interworld letterexchanges, Scile had corresponded with local researchers; and I, never a loner, had contacts and the quick intense friendships that come and go among immersers; so we knew wed have a reasonable turnout.There in my national capital, which most Embassytowners never saw, I could register with the union, download savings into my main account, amass news of Bremen jurisdiction.The flat I owned was in an unfashionable but pleasant part of the city.Around my house I rarely saw anyone accoutremented with the silly luxury tech imported from Embassytown.Being married under local law would make it easier for Scile to visit any of Bremens provinces or holdings.I responded for a long time to his pestering fascination, never the joke he at first pretended, with the information that Id no intention of returning to Embassytown.But I think by the time we married I was ready to give him the gift of taking him to my first home.IT WASNT wholly straightforward: Bremen controlled entry to some of its territories almost as carefully as it did egress.We were intending to disembark there, so I wasnt just signing up on a merchant run.At Transit House, perplexed officials sent me up a chain of authority.Id expected that but I was mildly surprised at how high, if my reading of office furniture as evidence wasnt on the fritz, the buck passing went.You want to go back to Embassytown?a woman who must presumably have been only a rung or two down from the boss said.You have to realise thats...unusual.So everyone keeps telling me.You miss home?Hardly, I told her.The things we do for love.I sighed theatrically but she didnt want to play.Its not as if I relish the idea of being stuck so far from the hub.She met my look and did not respond.She asked me what I planned to do on Arieka, in Embassytown.I told her the truthto floak, I said.That didnt amuse her either.To whom would I be reporting on arrival?I told her no oneI was no ones subordinate there, I was a civilian.She reminded me that Embassytown was a Bremen port.Where had I been since entering the out?Everywhere, she stressed, and who could remember that?I had to go through my cartas and all my old dat swipes, though she must have known that at plenty of places such formalities of arrival were slapdash.She read my list, including terminuses and brief stops I didnt remember at all.She asked me questions about the local politics of one or two at which I could only smile, so ill equipped was I to answer; and she stared at me as I burbled.I wasnt sure what she suspected me of.Ultimately, as a carta carrying Embassytown native immerser, crewing and vouching for my fianc, it only took tenacity to get him the rights to entry, and me to reentry.Scile had been preparing for his work there, reading, listening to recordings, watching what few trids and vids there are.Hed even decided on what the title of his book would be.One shift only, I told him.Were only going until the next relief.In Charo City, in a cathedral to Christ Uploaded, which to my surprise he asked for, I married Scile according to Bremen law, in the second degree, registering as a nonconnubial love match, and I took him to Embassytown.Part One  INCOME    Latterday, 1   DIPLOMACY HALL was jammed.It was usual for every ball, every greeting of leaving visitors, to be busy, but not like that night.It was hardly surprising: thered been extraordinary anticipation.However much the Staff might have insisted to us all that this was a regular arrival, they didnt even attempt to sound as if they believed it.I was jostled among the dress clothes.I wore jewels and I activated a few augmens that sent a corona of pretty lights around me.I leaned against the wall in the thick leaves.Well dont you look good?Ehrsul had found me.Short hair.Choppy.Like it.Did you say goodbye to Kayliegh?I thank you, and I did indeed.I still cant believe she got the papers to leave.Well.Ehrsul nodded to where Kayliegh hung onto the arm of Damier, a Staffwoman partly responsible for cartas.I think she may have made a horizontal application.I laughed.Ehrsul was autom.Her integument was adorned that night with acrylic peacock feathers, and trid jewellery orbited her.Im so tired, she said.She made her face crackle as if static interrupted it.Im just waiting to see our new Ambassador in actionhow can I not, really?then Im gone.She only ever used one corpus, according to some Terrephile sense of politesse or accommodation.I think she knew that having to relate to someone variably physically incarnate would trouble us.She was import, of course, though it wasnt clear where shed come from, or when.Shed been in Embassytown for longer than the lifetime of anyone I knew.Her Turingware was way beyond local capabilities, and more than the equal of any Id seen in the out.Spending time with most automa is like accompanying someone brutally cognitively damaged, but Ehrsul was a friend.Come save me from the village idiots, she sometimes said to me after downloading updates alongside other automa.Do you joke to yourself when no ones watching?I had asked her once.Does it matter?she had said at last, and I felt scolded.It had been rude and adolescent to raise the question of her personality, her apparent consciousness, of whether it was for my benefit.It was a tradition that none of the few automs whose behaviour was human enough to prompt the question would answer it.She was my best friend, and somewhat well known, oddity that she was.When I met her I was certain I had seen her before.I couldnt place it, at first; then when I realised what I thought the situation had been I asked her abruptly (as if I could startle her): What did they want you there for?At Brens place, ages ago, when the Ambassadors recited my simile to me?That was you, wasnt it?Remember?Avice, she had said, gently reproving, and made her face shake as if disappointed.That was all I ever got from her on the matter and I didnt push it.We huddled together by the indoor ivy and watched little cams flit around the room, recording.Decorative biorigging shed colours from carapaces.Have you met them, then?Ehrsul said.The esteemed intake for whom we wait?I havent.That surprised me.Ehrsul had no job, wasnt under the obligation of any tithe, but as a computer she was valuable to Staff, and often acted for them.I would have said the same about methat my inside outside status had been useful to themuntil I fell from favour.Id have expected Ehrsul to be part of whatever discussions had been ongoing, but since the new Ambassador had arrived, apparently, the Staff had retreated into clique.Theres tussling, Ehrsul said.Thats what Ive heard.People told Ehrsul things: perhaps it was because she wasnt human, but was almost.I think she also tapped into the localnet, broke encryption on enough snips to be a good source of information to friends.People are worried.Though I gather some have rather taken a shine...Watch MagDa.And now Wyatts been insisting on getting involved.Wyatt?Hes been citing old laws, trying to brief the Ambassador alone, thank you very much.That sort of thing.Wyatt, the Bremen representative, had arrived with his small staff on the previous trade vessel, to relieve Chettenham, his predecessor.He was scheduled to leave in one more tours time.Bremen had established Embassytown somewhat more than two megahours ago.We were all juridically Bremeni: protectees.But the Ambassadors who governed formally in Bremens name were born here, of course, as were Staff and we who made up their canton.Wyatt, Chettenham and other attachs on their lengthy postings relied on Staff for trade information, for suggestions, for access to Hosts and tech.It was rare for them to issue orders other than Carry on.They were advisors to Staff, too, useful for gauging the politics in the capital.I was intrigued that Wyatt was now interpreting his remit in so muscular a fashion.This was the first time in living memory that an Ambassador had arrived from the out.Had the party not forced their handsthe ship was leaving and the ball couldnt be delayed I suspected the Staff would have tried to quarantine the new arrivals longer, and continued with whatever their intrigues were.CalVins here, Ehrsul warned quietly, her displayed face glancing over my shoulder.I did not look round.She looked at me and made a little what?face, telling me without words that shed still like to know what had happened there, sometime.I shook my head.Yanna Southel, Embassytowns senior research scientist, arrived, and with her an Ambassador.I whispered to Ehrsul, Good, its EdGar.Time to schmooze.
