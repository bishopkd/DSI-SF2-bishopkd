All of us traveled together in a little pack.To be perfectly honest, our band had formerly consisted of a couple of hundred dinosaurs, most of them duck billed plant eaters, but Utahraptor and I had been forced to eat most of these just a few a day, of course, so that they didn't notice at first, as they were not very intelligent.Finally their number had dwindled to one, a gaunt and gamy fellow named Everett, whom we tried to stretch out for as long as we could.During those last few days, Everett was constantly looking around for his companions.Like all plant eaters, he had eyes in the side of his head and could see in almost all directions.Everett seemed to think that if he could just swivel his head around in the right direction, a big healthy pack of duck bills would suddenly rotate into view.At the very end, I think that Everett may have put two and two together; I saw him blink in surprise once, as if the light had finally gone on in his head, and the rest of that day he was very quiet, as if all of his half dozen or so neurons were busy working out the implications.After that, as we continued across this burned country where Everett had nothing to eat, he became more and more listless and whiny until finally Utahraptor lost his temper, lashed out with one leg, and there was Everett's viscera sitting there on the ground like a sack of groceries.Then there was simply nothing to do except eat him.I got most of him as usual, though Utahraptor kept darting in around my ankles and snatching up choice bits, and from time to time Pteranodon would swoop in and grab a whorl of intestine.Ankylosaurus stood off to the side and watched.For a long time we'd taken him for an idiot, because he would always just squat there watching us divide up those duck bills, munching stupidly on the erratic horsetail, never saying much.In retrospect, maybe he was just a taciturn sort.He must have worked out that we would very much like to eat him, if only we could locate some chink in his armor.If only we had!For many days after Everett had become just another scat on our tracks, Utahraptor and Pteranodon and I trudged across that dead landscape eyeing Ankylosaurus, drooling down our chins as we imagined the unspeakably tender morsels that must lie nestled inside that armored shell.He must have been hungry too, and no doubt his morsels were getting less fat and tender by the day.From time to time we would encounter some sheltered hollow where unfamiliar green plants were poking their shoots through the black and gray debris, and we would encourage Ankylosaurus to stop, take his time, and eat all he wanted."No, really!We don't mind waiting for you!"He would always fix his tiny little side mounted eyes on us and look at us balefully as he grazed."How was your dinner, Anky?"we'd say, and he'd grumble something like, "Tastes like iridium as usual," and then we'd go another couple of days without exchanging a word.One day we reached the edge of the sea.The salt water lapped up onto a lifeless beach strewn with the bones of extinct sea creatures, from tiny trilobites all the way up to plesiosaurs.Behind us was the desert we'd just crossed.To the south was a range of mountains that would have been impassable even if half of them hadn't been erupting volcanoes.And north of us we could see snow dusting the tops of the hills, and we all knew what that meant: If we went in that direction, we'd soon freeze to death.So we were stuck there, the four of us, and though we didn't have mediatrons and cine aerostats in those days, we all pretty much knew what was up: We were the last four dinosaurs on earth.Pretty soon we would be three, and then two, and then one, and then none at all, and the only question left to settle was in what order we'd go.You might think this would be awful and depressing, but it wasn't really that bad; being dinosaurs, we didn't spend a lot of time pondering the imponderables, if you know what I mean, and in a way it was kind of fun waiting to see how it would all work out.There was a general assumption on all hands, I think, that Ankylosaurus would be the first to go, but Utah and I would have killed each other in an instant.So we all kind of faced off on the beach there, Utahraptor and Ankylosaurus and I in a neat triangle with Pteranodon hovering overhead.After we had been facing off there for some hours, I noticed out of the corner of my eye that the banks to the north and south seemed to be moving, as if they were alive.Suddenly there was a thundering and rushing sound in the air all around us, and I couldn't help looking up, though I kept one sharp eye on Utahraptor.The world had been such a quiet and dead place for so long that we were startled by any noise or movement, and now it seemed that the air and ground had come alive once more, just as in the old days before the comet.The noise in the air was caused by a great flock of teensy tiny Pteranodons, though instead of smooth reptilian skin their wings were covered with oversize scales, and they had toothless, bony beaks instead of proper mouths.These miserable things these airborne crumbs were swarming all around Pteranodon, getting in his eyes, pecking at his wings, and it was all he could do to keep airborne.As I mentioned, I was keeping one eye on Utahraptor as always, and to my surprise he suddenly turned away and ran up onto the north slope, with an eagerness that could be explained only by the availability of food.I followed him, naturally, but pulled up short.Something was wrong.The ground on the north slope was covered with a moving carpet that swarmed around Utahraptor's feet.Focusing my eyes, which frankly were not very good, I saw that this carpet actually consisted of thousands of tiny dinosaurs whose scales had grown very long and slender and numerous in short, they were furry.I had been seeing these quadrupedal hors d'oeuvres dodging around under logs and rocks for the last few million years and always taken them for an especially ill conceived mutation.But suddenly there were thousands of them, and this at a time when there were only four dinosaurs left in the whole world.And they seemed to be working together.They were so tiny that Utahraptor had no way to get them into his mouth, and whenever he stopped moving for an instant, they swarmed onto his legs and tail and nipped at his flesh.A plague of shrews.I was so confounded that I stopped in my tracks.That was a mistake, for soon I felt a sensation in my legs and tail like millions of pinpricks.Turning around, I saw that the south slope was covered with ants, millions of them, and they had apparently decided to eat me.Meanwhile Ankylosaurus was bellowing and swinging his bony ball around without effect, for the ants were swarming on his body as well.Well, before long the shrews and the ants and the birds started to run into each other and have skirmishes of their own, and so at that point they called a truce.The King of the Birds, the King of the Shrews, and the Queen of the Ants all got together on top of a rock to parley.In the meantime they left us dinosaurs alone, seeing that we were trapped in any case.The situation struck me as unfair, so I approached the rock where these despicable micro monarchs were chattering away, a mile a minute, and spoke: "Yo!Aren't you going to invite the King of the Reptiles?"They looked at me like I was crazy."Reptiles are obsolete," said the King of the Shrews."Reptiles are just retarded birds," said the King of the Birds, "and so I am your King, thank you very much. "There's only zero of you," said the Queen of the Ants.In ant arithmetic, there are only two numbers: Zero, which means anything less than a million, and Some."You can't cooperate, so even if you were King, the title would be meaningless. ""Besides," said the King of the Shrews, "the purpose of this summit conference is to decide which of our kingdoms shall eat which dinosaur, and we do not suppose that the King of the Dinosaurs, even if there were such a thing, would be able to participate constructively. "Mammals always talked this way to show off their oversize brains which were basically the same as ours, but burdened with a lot of useless extra business on top useless, I should say, but darn tasty."But there are three kingdoms and four dinosaurs," I pointed out.Of course this was not true in ant arithmetic, so the Queen of the Ants immediately began to make a fuss.In the end I had to go over among the ants and crush them with my tail until I had killed a few million, which is the only way that you can get an ant to take you seriously."Surely three dinosaurs would be enough to give all of your subjects a square meal," I said."May I suggest that the birds peck Pteranodon to the bone, the shrews tear Utahraptor limb from limb, and the ants feast on the corpse of Ankylosaurus?"The three monarchs appeared to be considering this suggestion when Utahraptor sped up in a huff."Excuse me, Your Royal Highnesses, but who appointed this fellow king?I am just as qualified to be king as he. "In short order, Pteranodon and Ankylosaurus also laid claim to the throne.The King of the Shrews, the King of the Birds, and the Queen of the Ants told us all to shut up, and then conferred amongst themselves for a few minutes.Finally the King of the Shrews stepped forward."We have reached a decision," he said."Three dinosaurs will be eaten, and one, the King of the Reptiles, will be spared; all that remains is for one of you to demonstrate that you are superior to the other three and deserve to wear the crown. ""Very well!"I said, and turned on Utahraptor, who began backing away from me, hissing and swiping the air with his giant claws.If I could dispatch Utahraptor with a frontal assault, Pteranodon would swoop down to steal some of the carrion, and I could ambush her then; having fortified myself by eating the other two, I might be strong enough to overcome Ankylosaurus."No, no, no!"screamed the King of the Shrews."This is just the kind of thing I was talking about when I said you reptiles were obsolete.It's not about who is the biggest and baddest anymore. ""It's about cooperation, organization, regimentation," said the Queen of the Ants."It's about brains," said the King of the Shrews."It's about beauty, glory, dazzling flights of inspiration!"said the King of the Birds.This precipitated another stridulent dispute among the two Kings and the Queen.Everyone got very short tempered, and there probably would have been serious trouble if the tide had not come in and washed a few whale carcasses and dead elasmosaurs onto the beach.As you can imagine, we fell upon these gifts with abandon, and while I was eating my fill, I also managed to swallow innumerable birds, shrews, and ants who were feasting on the same pieces of meat as I.   After everyone had filled their bellies and calmed down somewhat, the Kings and the Queen resumed their discussions.Finally the King of the Shrews, who seemed to be the designated spokesmonarch, stepped forward again."We cannot come to an agreement as to which of you should be the King of the Reptiles, so each of our nations, Birds, Mammals, and Ants, will put each of you to a trial, and then we will gather again and put it to a vote.If the vote results in a tie, we will eat all four of you and bring the Kingdom of Reptiles to an end. "We drew lots, and I was chosen to go among the ants for the first round of trials.I followed the Queen into the midst of her army, picking my way slowly until the Queen said, "Step lively, lung breather!Time is food!Don't worry about those ants beneath your feet you can't possibly kill more than zero!"So from then on, I just walked normally, though my claws became slick with crushed ants.We traveled south for a day or two and then stopped on a stream bank."South of here is the territory of the King of the Cockroaches.Your first task is to bring me the head of the King. "Looking across the river, I could see that the entire countryside was swarming with an infinite number of cockroaches, more than I could ever stomp; and even if I could stomp them all, there must be more below the ground, which was doubtless where the King lived.I waded across the river and traveled through the Kingdom of the Cockroaches for three days until I crossed another river and entered into the Kingdom of the Bees.This place was greener than any I'd seen for a while, with many wildflowers, and bees swarmed everywhere taking nectar back to their nests, which were as big as houses.This gave me an idea.I toppled several hollow trees filled with honey, dragged them back to the Kingdom of the Cockroaches, split them open, and made sticky honey trails leading down toward the ocean.The cockroaches followed the trails down to the water's edge, where the waves broke over their heads and drowned them.For three days I kept watch over the beach as the number of cockroaches dwindled, and finally on the third day the King of the Roaches emerged from his throne room to see where everyone had gone.I coaxed him onto a leaf and carried him back north across the river and into the Kingdom of the Ants, much to the amazement of the Queen.Next I was put into the care of the King of the Birds.He and his chirping, chattering army led me up into the mountains, up above the snowline, and I was sure that I would freeze to death.But as we continued up, it suddenly became warmer, which I did not understand until I realized that we were approaching a live volcano.We finally stopped at the edge of a red hot lava flow half a mile wide.In the center of the flow, a tall black rock stood out like an island in the middle of a river.The King of the Birds plucked one golden feather from his tail and gave it to a soldier, who took it in his beak, flew over the lava, and left that feather on the very top of the black rock.By the time that soldier flew back, he was half roasted from the heat radiating from the lava and don't think my mouth didn't water!"Your job," said the King, "is to bring me that feather. "Now, this was clearly unfair, and I protested that the birds were obviously trying to favor Pteranodon.This kind of argument might have worked with ants or even shrews; but the King of the Birds would hear none of it.For them, virtue consisted in being birdlike, and fairness didn't enter into it.Well, I stood on the edge of that lava flow until my skin smoked, but I couldn't see how to reach that feather.Finally I decided to give up.I was walking away, cutting my feet on the sharp rock, when suddenly it hit me: The rock I'd been standing on, this whole time, was nothing other than lava that had gotten cold and solidified.This was high in the mountains, where glaciers and snowfields soared above me like palace walls.I climbed up onto a particularly steep slope and began pounding the snow with my tail until I started an avalanche.Millions of tons of ice and snow thundered down onto the lava flow, throwing up a tremendous blast of steam.For three days and nights I could not see the claws in front of my face for all of the steam, but on the third day it finally cleared away, and I saw a bridge of hardened lava running straight to that black rock.I scampered across (to the extent that a dinosaur can scamper), snatched that golden feather, ran back, and stood in the snow for a while cooling my feet off.Then I marched back to the King of the Birds, who was, of course, astonished.Next I found myself in the care of the mammals, who were almost all shrews.They led me up into the foothills, to the mouth of a great cave."Your job," said the King of the Shrews, "is to wait here for Dojo and then defeat him in single combat. "Then all the shrews went away and left me there alone.I waited in front of that cave for three days and three nights, which gave me plenty of time to scope the place out.At first I was rather cocky about this challenge, for it seemed the easiest of the three; while I had no idea who or what Dojo was, I knew that in all the world I had never met my equal when it came to single combat.But on the first day, sitting there on my tail waiting for Dojo, I noticed a sprinkling of small glittering objects on the ground, and examining them carefully I realized that they were, in fact, scales.To be precise, they were dinosaur scales, which I recognized as belonging to Pteranodon, Ankylosaurus, and Utahraptor, and they appeared to have been jarred loose from their bodies by powerful impacts.On the second day I prowled around the vicinity and found tremendous gashes in tree trunks, which had undoubtedly been made by Utahraptor as he slashed wildly at Dojo; other trees that had been snapped off entirely by the club at the end of the tail of Ankylosaurus; and long scratches in the earth made by the talons of Pteranodon as she dove again and again at some elusive opponent.At this point, I became concerned.It was clear that all three of my opponents had fought Dojo and lost, so if I lost also (which was inconceivable), I would be even with the others; but the rules of the contest stated that in the event of a tie, all four dinosaurs would be eaten, and the Kingdom of Reptiles would be no more.I spent the night fretting about who or what the terrible Dojo was.On the third day nothing happened, and I began wondering whether I should go into the cave and look for Dojo.So far the only living thing I had seen around here was a black mouse that occasionally darted out from the rocks at the cave's entrance, foraging for a bit of food.The next time I saw that mouse, I said (speaking softly so as not to scare it),  "Say, mouse!Is there anything back inside that cave?"The black mouse sat up on its haunches, holding a huckleberry between its little hands and nibbling on it."Nothing special," he said, "just my little dwelling.A fireplace, some tiny pots and pans, a few dried berries, and the rest is full of skeletons. ""Skeletons?"I said."Of other mice?""There are a few mouse skeletons, but mostly they are dinosaurs of one kind or another, primarily meat eaters. ""Who have become extinct because of the comet," I suggested."Oh, pardon me, sir, but I must respectfully inform you that the deaths of these dinosaurs are unrelated to the comet. ""How did they die, then?"I asked."I regret to say that I killed them all in self defense. ""Ah," I said, not quite believing it, "then you must be .."Dojo the Mouse," he said, "at your service. ""I am terribly sorry to have bothered you, sir," I said, using my best manners, for I could see that this Dojo was an unusually polite sort, "but your fame as a warrior has spread far and wide, and I have come here humbly to seek your advice on how I may become a better warrior myself; for it has not escaped my notice that in the postcomet environment, teeth like carving knives and six tons of muscle may be in some sense outmoded. "What follows is a rather long story, for Dojo had much to teach me and he taught it slowly.Sometime, Nell, I will teach you everything I learned from Dojo; all you need do is ask.But on the third day of my apprenticeship, when I still had not learned anythingexcept humility, good manners, and how to sweep out the cave, I asked Dojo if he would be interested in playing a game of tic tac toe.This was a common sport among dinosaurs.We would scratch it out in the mud.(Many paleontologists have been baffled to find tic tac toe games littering prehistoric excavations and have chalked it up to the local workers they hire to do their digging and hauling. )In any case, I explained the rules of the game to Dojo, and he agreed to give it a try.We went down to the nearest mud flat, and there, in plain view of many shrews, I played a game of tic tac toe with Dojo and vanquished him, although I will confess it was touch and go for a while.It was done; I had defeated Dojo in single combat.The next morning I excused myself from Dojo's cave and went back down to the beach, where the other three dinosaurs had already gathered, looking much the worse for wear as you can imagine.The King of the Shrews, the King of the Birds, and the Queen of the Ants converged on us with all their armies and crowned me King of the Reptiles, or Tyrannosaurus Rex as we used to say.Then they ate the other three dinosaurs as agreed.Besides me, the only reptiles left were a few snakes, lizards, and turtles, who continue to be my obedient subjects.I could have lived a luxurious life as King, but by now, Dojo had taught me humility, and so I went back to his cave immediately and spent the next few million years studying his ways.All you need do is ask, Nell, and I will pass his knowledge on to you.Judge Fang goes for a dinner cruise with a Mandarin;  they visit a mysterious ship;  a startling discovery;  a trap is sprung.Dr.X's boat was not the traditional sort of wallowing pleasure barge that was fit only for the canals and shallow lakes of the Yangtze's sodden delta; it was a real ocean going yacht built on Western lines.Judging from the delicacies that began to make their way up to the foredeck shortly after Judge Fang came aboard, the vessel's galley had been retrofitted with all the accoutrements of a professional Chinese kitchen: umbrella size woks, gas burners like howling turbojets, and extensive storage lockers for innumerable species of fungi as well as bird nests, shark fins, chicken feet, fcetal rats, and odds and ends of many other species both rare and ubiquitous.The courses of the meal were small, numerous, and carefully timed, served up in an array of fine porcelain that could have filled several rooms of the Victoria and Albert Museum, delivered with the precision of surgical air strikes by a team of waiters.Judge Fang got to eat this way only when someone really important was trying to taint him, and though he had never knowingly allowed his judicial judgment to be swayed, he did enjoy the chow.They began with tea and some preliminary courses on the foredeck of the yacht, as it made its way down the Huang Pu, with the old European buildings of the Bund on the left, lit up eerily by the wash of colored light radiating from the developments of Pudong, which rose precipitously from the bank on the right.At one point, Dr.X had to excuse himself belowdecks for a few moments.Judge Fang strolled to the very bow of the yacht, nestled himself into the acute angle formed by the converging rails, let the wind tug at his beard, and enjoyed the view.The tallest buildings in Pudong were held up by huge aerostats vacuumfilled ellipsoids hundreds of stories above street level, much wider than the buildings they supported, and usually covered with lights.Some of these extended out over the river itself.Judge Fang rested his elbows carefully on the rail to maintain his balance, then tilted his head back so that he was staring straight up at the underside of one such, pulsing with oversaturated colored light.The trompe l'oeil was enough to make him dizzy, and so he quickly looked down.Something thumped against the hull of the yacht, and he looked into the water to see a human corpse wrapped up in a white sheet, blundering along a foot or two beneath the surface, dimly luminescent in the light from the building overhead.In time the yacht made its way out into the estuary of the Yangtze, only a few miles from the East China Sea at this point, miles wide, and much colder and rougher.Judge Fang and Dr.X repaired to a dining cabin belowdecks with panoramic windows that mostly just reflected back the light of the candles and lanterns around the table.Not long after they had taken their seats, the yacht accelerated powerfully, first shooting forward and then leaping up out of the water before resuming its steady, level motion.Judge Fang realized that the yacht was actually a hydrofoil, which had been merely idling along on her hull while they had enjoyed the city view but which had now climbed up out of the water.The conversation so far had consisted almost entirely of formal courtesies.This had eventually led them into a discussion of Confucian philosophy and traditional culture, clearly a subject of interest to both of them.Judge Fang had complimented the Doctor on his sublime calligraphy, and they talked about that art for a while.Then, obligatorily returning the compliment, Dr.X told the Judge how superbly he was executing his duties as magistrate, particularly given the added difficulty of having to deal with barbarians."Your handling of the affair of the girl and the book was, in particular, a credit to your abilities," Dr.X said gravely.Judge Fang found it interesting that the boy who had actually stolen the book was not mentioned.He supposed that Dr.X was referring not so much to the criminal case as to Judge Fang's subsequent efforts to protect the girl."This person is grateful, but all credit should go to the Master," Judge Fang said."The prosecution of this case was founded entirely upon his principles, as you might have seen, had you been able to do us the honor of joining our discussion of the matter at the House of the Venerable and Inscrutable Colonel. ""Ah, it is indeed a misfortune that I could not attend," the Doctor said, "as it would, no doubt, have helped to improve my own, so imperfect understanding of the Master's principles. ""I meant no such insinuation rather, that the Doctor might have guided me and my staff to a more nearly adequate resolution of the affair than we were, in fact, able to devise. ""Perhaps it would have been good fortune for both of us for me to have been present in the Colonel's house on that day," Dr.X said, returning neatly to equilibrium.There was silence for a few minutes as a new course was brought out, plum wine poured by the waiter.Then Dr.X continued, "One aspect of the case on which I would have been particularly eager to consult your wisdom would have been the disposition of the book. "So he was still stuck on that book.Though it had been weeks since Dr.X had released any more of those book hunting mites into the airspace of the Leased Territories, Judge Fang knew that he was still offering a nice bounty to anyone who could tell him the whereabouts of the book in question.Judge Fang was beginning to wonder whether this obsession with the book might be a symptom of a general decline in the Doctor's mental powers."Your advice on the subject would have been of inestimable value to me," Judge Fang said, "as this aspect of the case was particularly troublesome for a Confucian judge.If the item of stolen property had been anything other than a book, it would have been confiscated.But a book is different it is not just a material possession but the pathway to an enlightened mind, and thence to a well ordered society, as the Master stated many times. ""I see," said Dr.X, slightly taken aback.He seemed genuinely thoughtful as he stroked his beard and stared into the flame of a candle, which had suddenly begun to flicker and gyrate chaotically.It seemed as though the Judge had raised a novel point here, which deserved careful consideration."Better to leave the book in the hands of one who could benefit from its wisdom, than to let it remain, inert, in a police warehouse. ""That was my no doubt less than perfect conclusion, hastily arrived at," Judge Fang said.Dr.X continued to ponder the matter for a minute or so."It does credit to your professional integrity that you are able to focus so clearly upon the case of one small person. ""As you will no doubt appreciate, being a far more accomplished scholar than I, the interests of the society come first.Beside that, the fate of one little girl is nothing.But other things being equal, it is better for society that the girl is educated than that she remain ignorant. "Dr.X raised his eyebrows and nodded significantly at this.The subject did not come up again during the rest of the meal.He assumed that the hydrofoil was swinging around in a lazy circle that would eventually take them back to the mouth of the Huang Pu.But when the engines were throttled back and the craft settled back onto its hull and began to rock with the waves again, Judge Fang could not see any lights outside the windows.They were nowhere near Pudong, nor any other inhabited land as far as he could tell.Dr.X gestured out the window at nothing and said, "I have taken the liberty of arranging this visit for you.It touches upon a case that has recently come under your purview and also has to do with a subject that seems of particular interest to you and which we have already discussed this evening. "When Judge Fang followed his host out onto the deck, he was finally able to make out their surroundings.They were on the open ocean, with no land in sight, though the urban glow of Greater Shanghai could clearly be seen to the west.It was a clear night with a nearly full moon that was illuminating the hull of an enormous ship nearby.Even without the moonlight this vessel would have been noticeable for the fact that it blocked out all of the stars in one quadrant of the sky.Judge Fang knew next to nothing about ships.He had toured an aircraft carrier in his youth, when it docked for a few days at Manhattan.He suspected that this ship was even larger.It was almost entirely dark except for pinpricks of red light here and there, suggesting its size and general shape, and a few horizontal lines of yellow light shining out the windows of its superstructure, many stories above their heads.Dr.X and Judge Fang were conveyed on board this vessel by a small crew who came out to meet them in a launch.As it drew alongside the Doctor's yacht, the Judge was startled to realize that its crew consisted entirely of young women.Their accents marked them as belonging to an ethnic subgroup, common in the Southeast, that lived almost entirely on the water; but even if they had not spoken, Judge Fang would have inferred this from their nimble handling of the boat.Within a few minutes, Dr.X and Judge Fang had been conveyed aboard the giant vessel through a hatch set into the hull near the waterline.Judge Fang noted that this was not an old fashioned steel vessel; it was made of nanotechnological substances, infinitely lighter and stronger.No matter compiler in the world was large enough to compile a ship, so the shipyards in Hong Kong had compiled the pieces one by one, bonded them together, and slid them down the ways into the sea, much as their pre Diamond Age predecessors had done.Judge Fang had been expecting that the ship would be some kind of bulk carrier, consisting almost entirely of huge compartments, but the first thing he saw was a long corridor running parallel to the keel, seemingly the length of the entire ship.Young women in white, pink, or occasionally blue dresses and sensible shoes bustled back and forth along this corridor entering into and emerging from its innumerable doors.There was no formal welcome, no captain or other officers.As soon as the boat girls had assisted them on board, they bowed and took their leave.Dr.X began to amble down the corridor, and Judge Fang followed him.The young women in the white dresses bowed as they approached, then continued on their way, having no time to waste on advanced formalities.Judge Fang had the general sense that they were peasant women, though none of them had the deep tans that were normally a mark of low social status in China.The boat girls had worn blue, so he gathered that this color identified people with nautical or engineering duties.In general, the ones in the pink dresses were younger and slenderer than the ones in the white dresses.The tailoring was different too; the pink dresses closed up the middle of the back, the white ones had two zippers symmetrically placed in the front.Dr.X chose a door, apparently at random, swung it open, and held it for Judge Fang.Judge Fang bowed slightly and stepped through it into a room about the dimensions of a basketball court, though with a lower ceiling.It was quite warm and humid, and dimly lit.The first thing he saw was more girls in white dresses, bowing to him.Then he realized that the room was otherwise filled with cribs, hundreds of cribs, and that each crib had a perfect little girl baby in it.Young women in pink bustled back and forth with diapers.From place to place, a woman sat beside a crib, the front of her white dress unzipped, breast feeding a baby.Judge Fang felt dizzy.He was not willing to acknowledge the reality of what he saw.He had mentally prepared himself for tonight's meeting with Dr.X by reminding himself, over and over, that the Doctor was capable of any trickery, that he could not take anything he saw at face value.But as many first time fathers had realized in the delivery room, there was something about the sight of an actual baby that focused the mind.In a world of abstractions, nothing was more concrete than a baby.Judge Fang whirled on his heel and stormed out of the room, brushing rudely past Dr.X.  He picked a direction at random and walked, strode, ran down the corridor, past five doors, ten, fifty, then stopped for no particular reason and burst through another door.It might as well have been the same room.He felt almost nauseous and had to take stern measures to keep tears from his eyes.He ran out of the room and stormed through the ship for some distance, going up several stairways, past several decks.He stepped into another room, chosen at random, and found the floor covered with cribs, evenly spaced in rows and columns, each one containing a sleeping one year old, dressed in fuzzy pink jammies with a hood and a set of mouse ears, each one clutching an identical white security blanket and nestled up with a stuffed animal.Here and there, a young woman in a pink dress sat on the floor on a bamboo mat, reading a book or doing needlework.One of these women, close to Judge Fang, set her needlework down, rearranged herself into a kneeling position, and bowed to him.Judge Fang gave her a perfunctory bow in return, then padded over to the nearest crib.A little girl with astonishingly thick eyelashes lay there, deeply asleep, breathing regularly, her mouse ears sticking out through the bars of the crib, and as Judge Fang stood and stared at her, he imagined that he could hear the breathing of all the children on this ship at once, combined into a gentle sigh that calmed his heart.All of these children, sleeping so peacefully; everything must be okay.It was going to be fine.He turned away and saw that the young woman was smiling at him.It was not a flirting smile or a silly girlish smile but a calm and confident smile.Judge Fang supposed that wherever Dr.X was on this ship, he must be smiling in much the same way at this moment....When Dr.X started the cine, Judge Fang recognized it right away: This was the work of the mediagrapher PhyrePhox, who was still, as far as he knew, languishing in a holding cell in downtown Shanghai.The setting was an outcropping of stones amid a dun, dust scoured vastitude, somewhere in the interior of China.The camera panned across the surrounding waste, and Judge Fang did not have to be told that these had once been fertile fields, before the water table had been drained out from under them.A couple of people approached, kicking up a plume of dust as they walked, carrying a small bundle.As they drew closer, Judge Fang could see that they were horrifyingly gaunt, dressed in dirty rags.They came to the center of the rocky outcropping and laid the bundle on the ground, then turned and walked away.Judge Fang turned away from the mediatron and dismissed it with a wave of the hand; he did not have to see it to know that the bundle was a baby, probably female."This scene could have happened anytime in the history of China," Dr.X said.They were sitting in a rather spartan wardroom in the vessel's superstructure."It has always been done with us.The great rebellions of the 1800's were fueled by throngs of angry young men who could not find wives.In the darkest days of the Mao Dynasty's birth control policy, two hundred thousand little ones were exposed in this fashion" he gestured toward the frozen image on the mediatron "each year.Recently, with the coming of civil war and the draining of the Celestial Kingdom's aquifers, it has once again become common.The difference is that now the babies are collected.We have been doing it for three years. ""How many?"Judge Fang said."A quarter of a million to date," Dr.X said."Fifty thousand on this ship alone. "Judge Fang had to set his teacup down for a few moments while he grappled with this notion.Fifty thousand lives on this ship alone."It won't work," Judge Fang said finally."You can raise them this way until they are toddlers, perhaps but what happens when they are older and bigger, and must be educated and given space to run around and play?""It is indeed a formidable challenge," Dr.X said gravely, "but I trust you will take to heart the words of the Master: 'Let every man consider virtue as what devolves on himself.He may not yield the performance of it even to his teacher. 'I wish you good fortune, Magistrate. "This statement had much the same effect as if Dr.X had hit the Judge over the head with a board: startling, yes, but the full impact was somehow delayed."I'm not sure if I follow you, Doctor. "Dr.X crossed his wrists and held them up in the air."I surrender.You may take me into custody.Torture will not be necessary; I have already prepared a signed confession. "Judge Fang had not hitherto realized that Dr.X had such a well developed sense of humor.He decided to play along."As much as I would like to bring you to justice, Doctor, I am afraid that I cannot accept your surrender, as we are out of my jurisdiction. "The Doctor nodded to a waiter, who swung the cabin door open to let in a cool breeze and a view of the gaudy waterfront of the Leased Territories, suddenly no more than a mile away from them."As you can see, I have ordered the ships to come into your jurisdiction, Your Honor," Dr.X said.He gestured invitingly out the door.Judge Fang stepped out onto an open gangway and looked over the rail to see four other giant ships following in this one's wake.Dr.X's reedy voice came out through the open door."You may now take me, and the crew of these ships, to prison for the crime of baby smuggling.You may also take into custody these ships and all quarter million of the little mice on board.I trust you can find qualified caregivers somewhere within your jurisdiction. "Judge Fang gripped the rail with both hands and bowed his head.He was very close to clinical shock.It would be perfectly suicidal to call the Doctor's bluff.The concept of having personal responsibility for so many lives was terrifying enough in and of itself.But to think of what would eventually become of all of these little girls in the hands of the corrupt officialdom of the Coastal Republic.Dr.X continued, "I have no doubt that you will find some way to care for them.As you have demonstrated in the case of the book and the girl, you are too wise a magistrate not to understand the importance of proper upbringing of small children.No doubt you will exhibit the same concern for each one of these quarter of a million infants as you did for one little barbarian girl. "Judge Fang stood up straight, whirled, and strode back through the door."Shut the door and leave the room," he said to the waiter.When he and the Doctor were alone together, Judge Fang faced Dr.X, descended to his knees, bent forward, and knocked his forehead against the deck three times."Please, Your Honor!"Dr.X exclaimed, "it is I who should be doing honor to you in this way. ""For some time I have been contemplating a change of career," Judge Fang said, rising to an upright kneeling position.He stopped before continuing and thought it through once more.But Dr.X had left him no way out.It would have been uncharacteristic of the Doctor to spring a trap that could be escaped.As the Master had said, The mechanic, who wishes to do his  work well, must first sharpen his tools.When you are living in any  state, take service with the most worthy among its great officers,  and make friends of the most virtuous among its scholars."Actually, I am satisfied with my career, but dissatisfied with my tribal affiliation.I have grown disgusted with the Coastal Republic and have concluded that my true home lies in the Celestial Kingdom.I have often wondered whether the Celestial Kingdom is in need of magistrates, even those as poorly qualified as I. ""This is a question I will have to take up with my superiors," Dr.X said."However, given that the Celestial Kingdom currently has no magistrates whatsoever and therefore no real judicial system, I deem it likely that some role can be found for one with your superb qualifications. ""I see now why you desired the little girl's book so strongly," Judge Fang said."These young ones must all be educated. ""I do not desire the book itself so much as I desire its designer the artifex Hackworth," Dr.X said."As long as the book was somewhere in the Leased Territories, there was some hope that Hackworth could find it it is the one thing he desires most.If I could have found the book, I could have extinguished that hope, and Hackworth would then have had to approach me, either to get the book back or to compile another copy. ""You desire some service from Hackworth?""He is worth a thousand lesser engineers.And because of various hardships over the last few decades, the Celestial Kingdom does not have even that many lesser engineers; they have all been lured away by the promise of riches in the Coastal Republic. ""I will approach Hackworth tomorrow," Judge Fang said."I will inform him that the man known to the barbarians as Dr.X has found the lost copy of the book. ""Good," Dr.X said, "I shall expect to hear from him. "Hackworth's dilemma;  an unanticipated return to the hong of Dr.X;  hitherto unseen ramifications of Dr.X's premises;  a criminal is brought to justice.Hackworth had some time to run through the logic of the thing one more time as he waited in the front room of Dr.X's hong, waiting for the old man to free himself up from what sounded like a twelve way cine conference.On his first visit here he'd been too nervous to see anything, but today he was settled cozily in the cracked leather armchair in the corner, demanding tea from the help and thumbing through Dr.X's books.It was such a relief to have nothing to lose.Since that deeply alarming visit from Chang, Hackworth had been at his wits' end.He had made an immense cock up of the whole thing.Sooner or later his crime would come out and his family would be disgraced, whether or not he gave money to Chang.Even if he somehow managed to get the Primer back, his life was ruined.When he had received word that Dr.X had won the race to recover the lost copy of the Primer, the thing had turned from bad to farcical.He had cut a day at work and gone for a long hike in the Royal Ecological Conservatory.By the time he had returned home, sunburned and pleasantly exhausted, he had been in a much better mood.That Dr.X had the Primer actually improved his situation.In exchange for the Primer, the Doctor would presumably want something from Hackworth.In this case, it was not likely to be a mere bribe, as Chang had hinted; all of the money Hackworth had, or was ever likely to make, could not be of interest to Dr.X.  It was much more likely that the Doctor would want some sort of a favor he might ask Hackworth to design something, to do a little bit of consulting work, as it were.Hackworth wanted so badly to believe this that he had bolstered the hypothesis with much evidence, real and phantasmal, during the latter part of his hike.It was well known that the Celestial Kingdom was desperately far behind in the nanotechnological arms race; that Dr.X himself devoted his valuable time to rooting through the debris of the New Atlantan immune system proved this.Hackworth's skills could be of measureless value to them.If this were true, then Hackworth had a way out.He would do some job for the Doctor.In exchange, he would get the Primer back, which was what he wanted more than anything.As part of the deal, Dr.X could no doubt find some way to eliminate Chang from Hackworth's list of things to worry about; Hackworth's crime would never be known to his phyle....Victorians and Confucians alike had learned new uses for the foyer, anteroom, or whatever it was called, and for the old etiquette of visiting cards.For that matter, all tribes with sophistication in nanotech understood that visitors had to be carefully examined before they could be admitted into one's inner sanctum, and that such examination, carried out by thousands of assiduous reconnaissance mites, took time.So elaborate waiting room etiquette had flourished, and sophisticated people all over the world understood that when they called upon someone, even a close friend, they could expect to spend some time sipping tea and perusing magazines in a front room infested with unobtrusive surveillance equipment.One entire wall of Dr.X's front room was a mediatron.Cine feeds, or simple stationary graphics, could be digitally posted on such a wall just as posters and handbills had been in olden times.Over time, if not removed, they tended to overlap each other and build up into an animated collage.Centered on Dr.X's media wall, partly concealed by newer clips, was a cine clip as ubiquitous in northern China as the face of Mao Buddha's evil twin had been in the previous century.Hackworth had never sat and watched it all the way through, but he'd glimpsed it so many times, in Pudong taxicabs and on walls in the Leased Territories, that he knew it by heart.Westerners called it Zhang at the Shang.The setting was the front of a luxury hotel, one of the archipelago of Shangri Las strung up the Kowloon Guangzhou superhighway.The horseshoe drive was paved with interlocking blocks, brass door handles gleamed, thickets of tropical flowers sprouted from boat size planters in the lobby.Men in business suits spoke into cellphones and checked their watches, white gloved bellhops sprinted into the drive, pulled suitcases from the trunks of red taxicabs, wiped them down with clean moist cloths.The horseshoe drive was plugged into an eight lane thoroughfare not the highway, but a mere frontage road with a spiked iron fence running down the center to keep pedestrians from crossing in midblock.The pavement, new but already crumbling, was streaked with red dust washed down out of the devastated hills of Guangdong by the latest typhoon.Traffic suddenly became thin, and the camera panned upstream: Several lanes had been blocked by a swarm of bicycles.Occasionally a red taxi or Mercedes Benz would squeeze by along the iron fence and burst free, the driver holding down the horn button so furiously that he might detonate the air bag.Hackworth could not hear the sound of the horn, but as the camera zoomed in on the action, it became possible to see one driver take his hand off the horn and turn back to shake his finger at the mob of bicyclists.When he saw who was pedaling the lead bicycle, he turned away nauseous with fear, and his hand collapsed into his lap like a dead quail.The leader was a stocky man with white hair, sixtyish but pumping away vigorously on an unexceptional black bicycle, wearing drab worker's clothes.He moved it down the street with deceptive speed and pulled into the horseshoe drive.An embolism of bicycles formed on the street as hundreds tried to crowd in the narrow entrance.And here came another classic moment: The head bellhop skirted his stand up desk and ran toward the bicyclist, waving him off and hurling abuse in Cantonese until he got about six feet away and realized he was looking at Zhang Han Hua.At this point Zhang had no job title, being nominally retired an ironical conceit that the Chinese premiers of the late twentieth century and early twenty first had perhaps borrowed from American Mafia bosses.Perhaps they recognized that job titles were beneath the dignity of the most powerful man on earth.People who had gotten this close to Zhang claimed that they never thought about his temporal power the armies, the nuclear weapons, the secret police.All they could think about was the fact that, during the Great Cultural Revolution, at the age of eighteen, Zhang Han Hua had led his cell of Red Guards into hand to hand combat with another cell that they deemed insufficiently fervid, and that, at the conctusion of the battle, Zhang had feasted on the raw flesh of his late adversaries.No one could stand face to face with Zhang without imagining the blood streaming down his chin.The bellhop collapses to his knees and begins literally kowtowing.Zhang looks disgusted, hooks one of his sandaled feet under the bellhop's collarbone, and prods him back upright, then speaks a few words to him in the hillbilly accent of his native Fujien.The bellhop can hardly bow enough on his way back into the hotel; displeasure registers on Zhang's face all he wants is some fast service.During the next minute or so, progressively higher ranking hotel officials cringe out the door and abase themselves in front of Zhang, who simply ignores them, looking bored now.No one really knows whether Zhang is a Confucianist or a Maoist at this point in his life, but at this moment it makes no difference: for in the Confucian view of society, as in the Communist, peasants are the highest class and merchants the lowest.This hotel is not for peasants.Finally a man in a black business suit emerges, preceded and pursued by bodyguards.He looks angrier than Zhang, thinking that he must be the victim of some unforgivable practical joke.This is a merchant among merchants: the fourteenth richest man in the world, the third richest in China.He owns most of the real estate within half an hour's drive of this hotel.He does not break his stride as he steps into the drive and recognizes Zhang; he walks straight up to him and asks him what he wants, why the old man has bothered to come down from Beijing and interfere with his business on his foolish bicycle ride.Zhang simply steps forward and speaks a few words into the rich man's ear.The rich man takes a step back, as if Zhang has punched him in the chest.His mouth is open, revealing flawless white teeth, his eyes are not focused.After a few moments, he takes another two steps back, which gives him enough room for his next maneuver: He stoops, puts one knee down, then the other, bends forward at the waist until he is on all fours, then settles himself down full length on the nicely interlocked pavingstones.He puts his face on the pavement.He kowtows to Zhang Han Hua....One by one the Dolbyized voices in the next room signed off until only Dr.X and another gentleman were left, haggling about something desultorily, taking long breaks between volleys of tweeter busting oratory to stoke pipes, pour tea, or whatever these people did when they were pretending to ignore each other.The discussion petered out rather than building to a violent climax as Hackworth had secretly, mischievously been hoping, and then a young fellow pulled the curtain aside and said, "Dr.X will see you now. "Dr.X was in a lovely, generous mood probably calculated to convey the impression that he'd always known Hackworth would be back.He rustled to his feet, shook Hackworth's hand warmly, and invited him out to dinner "at a place nearby," he said portentously, "of utmost discretion.',  It was discreet because one of its cozy private dining rooms was connected directly to one of the back rooms of Dr.X's establishment, so that one could reach it by walking down a sinous inflated Nanobar tube that would have stretched to half a kilometer long if you extricated it from Shanghai, took it to Kansas, and pulled on both ends.Squinting through the translucent walls of the tube as he assisted Dr.X to dinner, Hackworth cloudily glimpsed several dozen people pursuing a range of activities in some half dozen different buildings, through which Dr.X had apparently procured some kind of right of way.Finally it spat them out into a nicely furnished and carpeted dining room, which had been retrofitted with a powered sliding door.The door opened just as they were sitting down, and Hackworth was almost knocked off balance as the tube sneezed nanofiltered wind; a beaming four foot tall waitress stood in the doorway, closing her eyes and leaning forward against the anticipated wind blast.In perfect San Fernando Valley English she said, "Would you like to hear about our specials?"Dr.X was at pains to reassure Hackworth that he understood and sympathized with his situation; so much so that Hackworth spent much of the time wondering whether Dr.X had already known about it."Say no more, it is taken care of," Dr.X finally said, cutting Hackworth off in midexplanation, and after that Hackworth was unable to interest Dr.X in the topic anymore.This was reassuring but unsettling, as he could not avoid the impression that he had just somehow agreed to a deal whose terms had not been negotiated or even thought about.But Dr.X's whole affect seemed to deliver the message that if you were going to sign a Faustian bargain with an ancient and inscrutable Shanghainese organized crime figure, you could hardly do better than the avuncular Dr.X, who was so generous that he would probably forget about it altogether, or perhaps just stow the favor away in a yellowed box in one of his warrens.By the end of the lengthy meal, Hackworth was so reassured that he had almost forgotten about Lieutenant Chang and the Primer altogether.Until, that is, the door slid open again to reveal Lieutenant Chang himself.Hackworth hardly recognized him at first, because he was dressed in a much more traditional outfit than usual: baggy indigo pajamas, sandals, and a black leather skullcap that concealed about seventy five percent of his knotlike skull.Also, he had begun to grow his whiskers out.Most alarmingly, he had a scabbard affixed to his belt, and the scabbard had a sword in it.He stepped into the room and bowed perfunctorily to Dr.X, then turned to face Hackworth."Lieutenant Chang?"Hackworth said wealdy."Constable Chang," said the interloper, "of the district tribunal of Shanghai. "And then he said the Chinese words that meant Middle Kingdom."I thought you were Coastal Republic. ""I have followed my master to a new country," Constable Chang said."I must regretfully place you under arrest now, John Percival Hackworth. ""On what charge?"Hackworth said, forcing himself to chuckle as if this were all a big practical joke among close friends."That on the  day of  , 21 , you did bring stolen intellectual property into the Celestial Kingdom specifically, into the hong of Dr.X and did use that property to compile an illegal copy of a certain device known as the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer. "There was no point in claiming that this was not true."But I have come here this evening specifically to regain possession of that same device," Hackworth said, "which is in the hands of my distinguished host here.Certainly you are not intending to arrest the distinguished Dr.X for trafficking in stolen property. "Constable Chang looked expectantly toward Dr.X.  The Doctor adjusted his robes and adopted a radiant, grandfatherly smile."I am sorry to tell you that some reprehensible person has apparently provided you with wrong information," he said."In fact, I have no idea where the Primer is located. "The dimensions of this trap were so vast that Hackworth's mind was still reeling through it, bouncing haplessly from one wall to another, when he was hauled before the district magistrate twenty minutes later.They had set up a courtroom in a large, ancient garden in the interior of Old Shanghai.It was an open square paved with flat gray stones.At one end was a raised building open to the square on one side, covered with a sweeping tile roof whose corners curved high into the air and whose ridgeline was adorned with a clay frieze portraying a couple of dragons facing off with a large pearl between them.Hackworth realized, dimly, that this was actually the stage of an open air theatre, which enhanced the impression that he was the sole spectator at an elaborate play written and staged for his benefit.A judge sat before a low, brocade covered table in the center of the stage, dressed in magnificent robes and an imposing winged hat decorated with a unicorn emblem.Behind him and off to one side stood a small woman wearing what Hackworth assumed were phenomenoscopic spectacles.When Constable Chang had pointed to a spot on the gray flagstones where Hackworth was expected to kneel, he ascended to the stage and took up a position flanking the Judge on the other side.A few other functionaries were arranged on the square, mostly consisting of Dr.X and members of his retinue, arranged in two parallel lines forming a tunnel between Hackworth and the Judge.Hackworth's initial surge of terror had worn off.He had now entered into morbid fascination with the incredible dreadfulness of his situation and the magnificent performance staged by Dr.X to celebrate it.He knelt silently and waited in a stunned, hyper relaxed state, like a pithed frog on the dissection table.Formalities were gone through.The Judge was named Fang and evidently came from New York.The charge was repeated, somewhat more elaborately.The woman stepped forward and introduced evidence: a cine record that was played on a large mediatron covering the back wall of the stage.It was a film of the suspect, John Percival Hackworth, slicing a bit of skin from his hand and giving it to (the innocent) Dr.X, who (not knowing that he was being gulled into committing a theft) extracted a terabyte of hot data from a cocklebur shaped mite, and so on, and so on."The only thing that remains is to prove that this information was, indeed, stolen though this is strongly implied by the suspect's behavior," Judge Fang said.In support of this assertion, Constable Chang stepped forward and told the story of his visit to Hackworth's flat."Mr.Hackworth," said Judge Fang, "would you like to dispute that this property was stolen?If so, we will hold you here while a copy of the information is supplied to Her Majesty's Police; they can confer with your employer to determine whether you did anything dishonest.Would you like us to do that?""No, Your Honour," Hackworth said."So you are not disputing that the property was stolen, and that you deceived a subject of the Celestial Kingdom into colluding with your criminal behavior?""I am guilty as charged, Your Honour," Hackworth said, "and I throw myself on the mercy of the court. ""Very well," Judge Fang said, "the defendant is guilty.The sentence is sixteen strokes of the cane and ten years' imprisonment. ""Goodness gracious!"Hackworth murmured.Inadequate as this was, it was the only thing that came to him."Insofar as the strokes of the cane are concerned, since the defendant was motivated by his filial responsibility to his daughter, I will suspend all but one, on one condition. ""Your Honour, I shall endeavour to comply with whatever condition you may choose to impose. ""That you supply Dr.X with the decryption key to the data in question, so that additional copies of the book may be made available to the small children crowding our orphanages. ""This I will gladly do," Hackworth said, "but there are complications.,,  "I'm waiting," Judge Fang said, not sounding very pleased.Hackworth got the impression that this business about the caning and the Primer was a mere prelude to something bigger, and that the Judge just wanted to get through it."In order for me to weigh the seriousness of these complications," Hackworth said, "I will need to know how many copies, approximately, Your Honour intends to make. ""In the range of hundreds of thousands. "Hundreds of thousands!"Please excuse me, but does Your Honour understand that the book is engineered for girls starting around the age of four?""Yes. "Hackworth was taken aback.Hundreds of thousands of children of both sexes and all ages would not have been difficult to believe.Hundreds of thousands of four year old girls was hard for the mind to grasp.Just one of them was quite a handful.But it was, after all, China."The magistrate is waiting," Constable Chang said."I must make it clear to Your Honour that the Primer is, in large part, a ractive that is, it requires the participation of adult ractors.While one or two extra copies might go unnoticed, a large number of them would overwhelm the built in system provided for paying for such services. ""Then part of your responsibility will be to make alterations in the Primer so that it is suitable for our requirements we can make do without those parts of the book that depend heavily on outside ractors, and supply our own ractors in some cases," Judge Fang said."This should be feasible.I can build in automatic voice generation capabilities not as good, but serviceable. "At this point, John Percival Hackworth, almost without thinking about it and without appreciating the ramifications of what he was doing, devised a trick and slipped it in under the radar of the Judge and Dr.X and all of the other people in the theatre, who were better at noticing tricks than most other people in the world."While I'm at it, if it pleases the court, I can also," Hackworth said, most obsequiously, "make changes in the content so that it will be more suitable for the unique cultural requirements of the Han readership.But it will take some time. ""Very well," said Judge Fang, "all but one stroke of the cane are suspended, pending the completion of these alterations.As for the ten years of imprisonment, I am embarrassed to relate that this district, being very small, does not have a prison, and so the suspect will have to be released this evening after the business with the cane is finished.But rest assured, Mr.Hackworth, that your sentence will be served, one way or another. "The revelation that he would be released to his family this very evening hit Hackworth like a deep lungful of opium smoke.The caning went by quickly and efficiently; he did not have time to worry about it, which helped a little.The pain sent him straight into shock.Chang pulled his flaccid body off the rack and bore him over to a hard cot, where he lay semiconscious for a few minutes.They brought him tea a nice Keemun with distinct lavender notes.Without further ado he was escorted straight out of the Middle Kingdom and into the streets of the Coastal Republic, which had never been more than a stone's throw away from him during all of these proceedings, but which might as well have been a thousand miles and a thousand years distant.He made his way straight to a public matter compiler, moving in a broad based gait, with tiny steps, bent over somewhat, and compiled some first aid supplies painkillers and some hmocules that supposedly helped to knit wounds together.Thoughts about the second part of the sentence, and how he might end up serving it, did not come back to him until he was halfway back across the Causeway, borne swiftly on autoskates, the wind keening through the fabric of his trousers and inflaming the laceration placed neatly across his buttocks, like the track of a router.This time, he was surrounded by a flock of hornet size aerostats flying in an ellipsoidal formation all around him, hissing gently and invisibly through the night and waiting for an excuse to swarm.This defensive system, which had seemed formidable to him when he compiled it, now seemed like a pathetic gesture.It might stop a youth gang.But he had insensibly transcended the plane of petty delinquents and moved into a new realm, ruled by powers almost entirely hidden from his ken, and knowable to the likes of John Percival Hackworth only insofar as they perturbed the trajectories of the insignificant persons and powers who happened to be in his vicinity.He could do naught but continue falling through the orbit that had been ordained for him.This knowledge relaxed him more than anything he had learned in many years, and when he returned home, he kissed the sleeping Fiona, treated his wounds with more therapeutic technology from the M. C. , covered them with pajamas, and slid beneath the covers.Drawn inward by Gwendolyn's dark radiant warmth, he fell asleep before he had even had time to pray.More tales from the Primer;  the story of Dinosaur and Dojo;  Nell learns a thing or two about the art of self defense;  Nell's mother gets, and loses, a worthy suitor;  Nell asserts her position against a young bully.She loved all of her four companions, but her favorite had come to be Dinosaur.At first she'd found him a little scary, but then she'd come to understand that though he could be a terrible warrior, he was on her side and he loved her.She loved to ask him for stories about the old days before the Extinction, and about the time he had spent studying with the mouse Dojo.There were other students too ...said the book, speaking in Dinosaur's voice, as Nell sat by herself in the corner of the playroom....In those days we had no humans, but we did have monkeys, and one day a little girl monkey came to the entrance of our cave looking quite lonely.Dojo welcomed her inside, which surprised me because I thought Dojo only liked warriors.When the little monkey saw me, she froze in terror, but then Dojo flipped me over his shoulder and bounced me off the walls of the cave a few times to demonstrate that I was fully under control.He made her a bowl of soup and asked her why she was wandering around the forest all by herself.The monkey, whose name was Belle, explained that her mother and her mother's boyfriend had kicked her out of the family tree and told her to go swing on the vines for a couple of hours.But the bigger monkeys hogged all the vines and wouldn't let Belle swing, so Belle wandered off into the forest looking for companionship and got lost, finally stumbling upon the entrance to Dojo's cave."You may stay with us for as long as you like," Dojo said."All we do here is play games, and you are invited to join our games if it pleases you. ""But I am supposed to be home soon," Belle complained."My mother's boyfriend will give me a whipping otherwise. ""Then I will show you the way from your family tree to my cave and back," Dojo said, "so that you can come here and play with us whenever your mother sends you out. "Dojo and I helped Belle find her way back through the forest to her family tree.On our way back to the cave, I said,  "Master, I do not understand. ""What seems to be the trouble?"Dojo said."You are a great warrior, and I am studying to become a great warrior myself.Is there a place in your cave for a little girl who just wants to play?""I'll be the judge of who does and doesn't make a warrior," Dojo said."But we are so busy with our drills and exercises," I said."Do we have time to play games with the child, as you promised?""What is a game but a drill that's dressed up in colorful clothing?"Dojo said."Besides, given that, even without my instruction, you weigh ten tons and have a cavernous mouth filled with teeth like butcher knives, and that all creatures except me flee in abject terror at the mere sound of your footsteps, I do not think that you should begrudge a lonely little girl some play time. "At this I felt deeply ashamed, and when we got home, I swept out the cave seven times without even being asked.A couple of days later, when Belle came back to our cave looking lonely and forlorn, we both did our best to make her feel welcome.Dojo began playing some special games with her, which Belle enjoyed so much that she kept coming back, and believe it or not, after a couple of years of this had gone by, Belle was able to flip me over her shoulder just as well as Dojo.Nell laughed to think of a little girl monkey flipping a great dinosaur over her shoulder.She went back one page and reread the last part more carefully:  A couple of days later, when Belle came back to our cave looking lonely and forlorn, we both did our best to make her feel welcome.Dojo made a special meal in his kitchen out of rice, fish, and vegetables and made sure that she ate every scrap.Then he began playing a special game with her called somersaults.An illustration materialized on the facing page.Nell recognized the open space in front of the entrance to Dojo's cave.Dojo was sitting up on a high rock giving instructions to Dinosaur and Belle.Dinosaur tried to do a somersault, but his tiny front arms could not support the weight of his massive head, and he fell flat on his face.Then Belle gave it a try and did a perfect somersault.Nell tried it too.It was confusing at first, because the world kept spinning around her while she did it.She looked at the illustration in the book and saw Belle doing exactly what Nell had done, making all of the same mistakes.Dojo scampered down from his rock and explained how Belle could keep her head and body straight.Nell followed the advice as she gave it another try, and this time it felt better.Before her time was up, she was doing perfect somersaults all over the playground.When she went back to the apartment, Mom wouldn't let her in at first, so she did somersaults up and down the hall for a while.Finally Mom let her in, and when she saw that Nell had gotten sand in her hair and shoes down at the playground, she gave her a spanking and sent her to bed without any food.But the next morning she went to the M. C.  and asked it for the special meal Dojo made for Belle.The M. C.  said it couldn't really make fish, but it could make nanosurimi, which was kind of like fish.It could make rice too.Vegetables were a problem.Instead it gave her some green paste she could eat with a spoon.Nell told the M. C.  that this was her Belle food and that she was going to have it all the time from now on, and after that the M. C.  always knew what she wanted.Nell didn't call it her magic book anymore, she called it by the name printed plain as day on the title page, which she'd only been able to read recently:  YOUNG LADY'S ILLUSTRATED PRIMER a Propdeutic Enchiridion in which is told the tale of Princess Nelland her various friends, kin, associates, &c.    The Primer didn't speak to her as often as it used to.She had found that she could often read the words more quickly than the book spoke them, and so she usually ordered it to be silent.She often put it under her pillow and had it read her bedtime stories, though, and sometimes she even woke up in the middle of the night and heard it whispering things to her that she had just been dreaming about.Tad had long since vanished from their home, though not before giving Mom a broken nose.He'd been replaced by Shemp, who had been replaced by Todd, who had given way to Tony.One day the Shanghai Police had come to arrest Tony, and he had plugged one of them right in the living room with his skull gun, blowing a hole in the guy's stomach so that intestines fell out and trailed down between his legs.The other policemen nailed Tony with a Seven Minute Special and then dragged their wounded comrade out into the hallway, while Tony, bellowing like a cornered, rabid animal, ran into the kitchen and grabbed a knife and began hacking at his chest where he thought the Seven Minute Special had gone into his body.By the time the seven minutes had gone by and the policemen burst back into the apartment, he had dug a hole in his pectoral muscle all the way down to his ribs.He menaced the cops with his bloody knife, and the cop in charge punched in some numbers on a little black box in his hand, and Tony buckled and screamed as a single cookie cutter detonated inside his thigh.He dropped the knife.The cops rushed in and shrink wrapped him, then stood around his body, mummified in glistening plastic, and kicked him and stomped him for a minute or two, then finally cut a hole in the plastic so Tony could breathe.They bonded four handles onto the shrink wrap and then carried him out between them, leaving Nell to clean up the blood in the kitchen and the living room.She wasn't very good at cleaning things up yet and ended up smearing it around.When Mom got home, she screamed and cried for a while and then spanked Nell for making a mess.This made Nell sad, and so she went to her room and picked up the Primer and made up a story of her own, about how the wicked stepmother had made Princess Nell clean up the house and had spanked her for doing it wrong.The Primer made up pictures as she went along.By the time she was finished, she had forgotten about the real things that had happened and remembered only the story she had made up.After that, Mom swore off men for a while, but after a couple of months she met a guy named Brad who was actually nice.He had a real job as a blacksmith in the New Atlantis Clave, and one day he took Nell to work with him and showed her how he nailed iron shoes onto the hooves of the horses.This was the first time Nell had actually seen a horse, and so she did not pay much attention to Brad and his hammers and nails.Brad's employers had a giant house with vast green fields, and they had four kids, all bigger than Nell, who would come out in fancy clothes and ride those horses.But Mom broke up with Brad; she didn't like craftsmen, she said, because they were too much like actual Victorians, always spouting all kinds of crap about how one thing was better than another thing, which eventually led, she explained, to the belief that some people were better than others.She took up with a guy named Burt who eventually moved in with them.Burt explained to Nell and Harv that the house needed discipline and that he intended to provide it, and after that he spanked them all the time, sometimes on the butt and sometimes on the face.He spanked Mom a lot too.Nell was spending much more time at the playground, where it was easier for her to do all of the exercises that Dojo was teaching to Belle.She also played games with the other kids sometimes.One day she was playing tetherball with a friend of hers and kept beating her every time.Then a boy came up, a boy bigger than either Nell or her friend, and insisted that he be allowed to play.Nell's friend gave up her place, and then Nell played against the boy, whose name was Kevin.Kevin was a big solid boy who was proud of his bulk and his strength, and his philosophy of tetherball was winning through intimidation.He would grab the ball, wind up melodramatically, baring his teeth and getting his face bright red, then smash the ball with a windmill punch, complete with sound effects that always showered the ball with spit.The performance was so impressive that many children just stood and watched it in awe, afraid to get in the way of the tetherball, and after that Kevin would just keep smashing the ball faster and faster on each revolution while vomiting profanity at his opponent.Nell knew that Kevin's mom had lived with a lot of the same guys that Nell's mom had lived with; he frequently sported black eyes that he certainly hadn't gotten on the playground.Nell had always been afraid of Kevin.But today when he wound up for his big serve, he just looked silly; kind of like Dinosaur did sometimes when sparring with Belle.The ball swung toward her, dewy with spit and not really going all that fast.Kevin was shouting things at her, calling her a cunt and other words, but for some reason Nell didn't hear it and didn'tcare, she just lunged toward the ball and punched it hard, putting her whole body behind her knuckles in a straight line, just as Dojo taught.She hit the ball so hard, she didn't even feel it; it shot up in a wide arc that took it behind and above Kevin's head, and after that all she had to do was give it a few more slaps as it whizzed by, and she'd won the game."Two out of three," Kevin said, and they played again, with the same result.Now all the kids were laughing at Kevin, and he lost his temper, turned bright red, and charged at Nell.But Nell had watched Kevin use this tactic on other kids, and she knew that it only worked because usually the kids were too scared to move.Dojo had explained to Belle that the best way to fight Dinosaur was simply to get out of his way and let his own strength defeat him, so that's what Nell did with Kevin: stepped aside at the last minute, made one foot into a hook, and tripped him.Kevin smashed tremendously into a swingset, gathered himself up, and charged a second time.Nell dodged him and tripped him again."Okay," Kevin said, "you win. "He approached Nell holding out his right hand to shake.But Nell had seen this one too, and she knew it was a trick.She reached out with her right hand as if she were going to shake.But as Kevin was groping at this bait, every muscle in his arm tense, Nell turned her palm toward the floor and drew her hand down, then back across the middle of her body.She was watching Kevin as she did this and saw that his eyes were tracking her hand, mesmerized.She continued to move her hand around in a long ellipse, turning her palm upward, thrusting it forward, poking her fingers into Kevin's staring eyes.He put his hands to his face.She kicked him between the legs as hard as she could, taking her time and striking the target precisely.As he bent over, she grabbed his hair and kneed him in the face, then shoved him down on his butt and left him there, too surprised, for the moment, to start bawling.Hackworth lunches in distinguished company;  a disquisition on hypocrisy;  Hackworth's situation develops new complications.Hackworth arrived at the pub first.He got a pint of porter at the bar, cask conditioned stuff from the nearby Dovetail community, and strolled around the place for a few minutes while he waited.He had been fidgeting at his desk all morning and enjoyed the opportunity to stretch his legs.The place was done up like an ancient London publican house circa World War II, complete with fake bomb damage to one corner of the structure and taped X's over each windowpane which only made Hackworth think of Dr.X.  Autographed photos of British and American airmen were stuck up on the walls here and there, along with other miscellany recalling the heyday of Anglo American cooperation:   SEND  a gun  TO DEFEND  A BRITISH HOME  British civilians, faced with threat of invasion, desperately  need arms for the defense of their homes.YOU CAN AID  American Committee for Defense of British Homes   Bowler hats hung in clusters from poles and wall hooks all over the room, like great bunches of black grapes.A lot of engineers and artifexes seemed to come to this place.They hunched over pints of beer at the bar and delved into steak and kidney pies at the little tables, chatting and chuckling.There was nothing prepossessing about the place or its patrons, but Hackworth knew that the odds and ends of nanotechnological lore collected in the heads of these middle class artisans was what ultimately kept New Atlantis wealthy and secure.He had to ask himself why he hadn't been satisfied with simply being one of them.John Percival Hackworth projected his thoughts into matter and did it better than anyone else in this place.But he had felt the need to go beyond that he had wanted to reach beyond mere matter and into someone's soul.Now, whether he wanted to or not, he was going to reach hundreds of thousands of souls.The men at the tables watched him curiously, then nodded politely and looked away when he caught their eye.Hackworth had noticed a full lane Rolls Royce parked in front of the place on his way in.Someone important was here, evidently in a back room.Hackworth and everyone else in the place knew it, and they were all in a heightened state of alertness, wondering what was up.Major Napier rode up on a standard issue cavalry chevaline and came in at noon on the dot, pulling off his officer's hat and exchanging a hilarious greeting with the barkeep.Hackworth recognized him because he was a hero, and Napier recognized Hackworth for reasons left provocatively unspecified.Hackworth translated his pint to the left and exchanged a vigorous handshake with Major Napier in front of the bar.They strolled toward the back of the place, exchanging some hearty, forgettable, balderdashladen banter.Napier stepped nimbly in front of him and pulled open a small door in the back wall.Three steps led down into a little snuggery with mullioned windows on three sides and a single copper covered table in the middle.A man was sitting by himself at the table, and as Hackworth descended the steps, he realized, that it was Lord Alexander Chung Sik Finkle McGraw, who stood up, returned his bow, and greeted him with a warm and hearty handshake, taking such evident measures to put Hackworth at ease that, in some respects, the opposite result was achieved.More banter, a bit more restrained.A waiter came in; Hackworth ordered a steak sandwich, today's special, and Napier simply nodded to the waiter to indicate his complete agreement, which Hackworth took as a friendly gesture.Finkle McGraw declined to eat anything.Hackworth was not really hungry anymore.It was clear that Royal Joint Forces Command had figured out at least some of what had happened, and that Finkle McGraw knew about it too.They had decided to approach him privately instead of simply lowering the boom on him and drumming him out of the phyle.This should have filled him with boundless relief, but it didn't.Things had seemed so simple after his prosecution in the Celestial Kingdom.Now he suspected they were about to get infinitely more complicated."Mr.Hackworth," Finkle McGraw said after the pleasantries had petered out, speaking in a new tone of voice, a the meeting will come to order sort of voice, "please favour me with your opinion of hypocrisy."Excuse me.Hypocrisy, Your Grace?""Yes.You know. ""It's a vice, I suppose. ""A little one or a big one?Think carefully much hinges upon the answer. ""I suppose that depends upon the particular circumstances. ""That will never fail to be a safe answer, Mr.Hackworth," the Equity Lord said reproachfully.Major Napier laughed, somewhat artificially, not knowing what to make of this line of inquiry."Recent events in my life have renewed my appreciation for the virtues of doing things safely," Hackworth said.Both of the others chuckled knowingly."You know, when I was a young man, hypocrisy was deemed the worst of vices," Finkle McGraw said."It was all because of moral relativism.You see, in that sort of a climate, you are not allowed to criticise others after all, if there is no absolute right and wrong, then what grounds is there for criticism?"Finkle McGraw paused, knowing that he had the full attention of his audience, and began to withdraw a calabash pipe and various related supplies and implements from his pockets.As he continued, he charged the calabash with a blend of leather brown tobacco so redolent that it made Hackworth's mouth water.He was tempted to spoon some of it into his mouth."Now, this led to a good deal of general frustration, for people are naturally censorious and love nothing better than to criticise others' shortcomings.And so it was that they seized on hypocrisy and elevated it from a ubiquitous peccadillo into the monarch of all vices.For, you see, even if there is no right and wrong, you can find grounds to criticise another person by contrasting what he has espoused with what he has actually done.In this case, you are not making any judgment whatsoever as to the correctness of his views or the morality of his behaviour you are merely pointing out that he has said one thing and done another.Virtually all political discourse in the days of my youth was devoted to the ferreting out of hypocrisy."You wouldn't believe the things they said about the original Victorians.Calling someone a Victorian in those days was almost like calling them a fascist or a Nazi. "Both Hackworth and Major Napier were dumbfounded."Your Grace!"Napier exdaimed."I was naturally aware that their moral stance was radically different from ours but I am astonished to be informed that they actually condemned the first Victorians. ""Of course they did," Finkle McGraw said."Because the first Victorians were hypocrites," Hackworth said, getting it.Finkle McGraw beamed upon Hackworth like a master upon his favored pupil."As you can see, Major Napier, my estimate of Mr.Hackworth's mental acuity was not ill founded. ""While I would never have supposed otherwise, Your Grace," Major Napier said, "it is nonetheless gratifying to have seen a demonstration. "Napier raised his glass in Hackworth's direction."Because they were hypocrites," Finkle McGraw said, after igniting his calabash and shooting a few tremendous fountains of smoke into the air, "the Victorians were despised in the late twentieth century.Many of the persons who held such opinions were, of course, guilty of the most nefandous conduct themselves, and yet saw no paradox in holding such views because they were not hypocrites themselves they took no moral stances and lived by none. ""So they were morally superior to the Victorians " Major Napier said, still a bit snowed under.  "even though in fact, because they had no morals at all. "There was a moment of silent, bewildered head shaking around the copper table."We take a somewhat different view of hypocrisy," Finkle McGraw continued."In the late twentieth century Weltanschauung, a hypocrite was someone who espoused high moral views as part of a planned campaign of deception he never held these beliefs sincerely and routinely violated them in privacy.Of course, most hypocrites are not like that.Most of the time it's a spirit is willing, flesh is weak sort of thing. ""That we occasionally violate our own stated moral code," Major Napier said, working it through, "does not imply that we are insincere in espousing that code. ""Of course not," Finkle McGraw said."It's perfectly obvious, really.No one ever said that it was easy to hew to a strict code of conduct.Really, the difficulties involved the missteps we make along the way are what make it interesting.The internal, and eternal, struggle, between our base impulses and the rigorous demands of our own moral system is quintessentially human.It is how we conduct ourselves in that struggle that determines how we may in time be judged by a higher power. "All three men were quiet for a few moments, chewing mouthfuls of beer or smoke, pondering the matter."I cannot help but infer," Hackworth finally said, "that the present lesson in comparative ethics which I thought was nicely articulated and for which I am grateful must be thought to pertain, in some way, to my situation. "The other men raised their eyebrows in a not very convincing display of mild astonishment.The Equity Lord turned toward Major Napier, who took the floor briskly and cheerfully."We do not know all the particulars of your situation as you know, Atlantan subjects are entitled to polite treatment from all branches of H. M.'s Joint Forces unless they violate the tribal norms, and that means, in part, that we don't go round putting people under high res surveillance just because we are curious about their, er, avocations.In an era when everything can be surveiled, all we have left is politeness.However, we do quite naturally monitor comings and goings through the border.And not long ago, our curiosity was piqued by the arrival of one Lieutenant Chang of the District Magistrate's Office.He was also clutching a plastic bag containing a rather battered top hat.Lieutenant Chang proceeded directly to your flat, spent half an hour there, and departed, minus the hat. "The steak sandwiches arrived at the beginning of this bit of exposition.Hackworth began messing about with condiments, as if he could belittle the importance of this conversation by paying equal attention to having just the right goodies on his sandwich.He fussed with his pickle for a while, then began examining the bottles of obscure sauces arrayed in the center of the table, like a sommelier appraising a wine cellar."I had been mugged in the Leased Territories," Hackworth said absently, "and Lieutenant Chang recovered my hat, somewhat later, from a ruffian. "He had fixed his gaze, for no special reason, on a tall bottle with a paper label printed in an ancient crabbed typeface."MCWHORTER'S ORIGINAL CONDIMENT" was written large, and everything else was too small to read.The neck of the bottle was also festooned with black and white reproductions of ancient medals awarded by pre Enlightenment European monarchs at exhibitions in places like Riga.Just a bit of violent shaking and thwacking ejected a few spurts of the ochre slurry from the pore size orifice at the top of the bottle, which was guarded by a quarter inch encrustation.Most of it hit his plate, and some impacted on his sandwich."Yes," Major Napier said, reaching into his breast pocket and taking out a folded sheet of smart foolscap.He told it to uncrease itself on the table and prodded it with the nib of a silver fountain pen the size of an artillery shell."Gatehouse records indicate that you do not venture into the L. T.  often, Mr.Hackworth, which is certainly understandable and speaks well of your judgment.There have been two forays in recent months.On the first of these, you left in midafternoon and returned late at night bleeding from lacerations that seemed to have been recently incurred, according to the" Major Napier could not repress a tiny smile "evocative description logged by the border patrol officer on duty that night.On the second occasion, you again left in the afternoon and returned late, this time with a single deep laceration across the buttocks not visible, of course, but picked up by surveillance. "Hackworth took a bite of his sandwich, correctly anticipating that the meat would be gristly and that he would have plenty of time to think about his situation while his molars subdued it.He did have plenty of time, as it turned out; but as frequently happened to him in these situations, he could not bring his mind to bear on the subject at hand.All he could think about was the taste of the sauce.If the manifest of ingredients on the bottle had been legible, it would have read something like this: Water, blackstrap molasses, imported habanero peppers, salt, garlic, ginger, tomato puree, axle grease, real hickory smoke, snuff, butts of clove cigarettes, Guinness Stout fermentation dregs, uranium mill tailings, muffler cores, monosodium glutamate, nitrates, nitrites, nitrotes and nitrutes, nutrites, natrotes, powdered pork nose hairs, dynamite, activated charcoal, match heads, used pipe cleaners, tar, nicotine, singlemalt whiskey, smoked beef lymph nodes, autumn leaves, red fuming nitric acid, bituminous coal, fallout, printer's ink, laundry starch, drain deaner, blue chrysotile asbestos, carrageenan, BHA, BHT, and natural flavorings.He could not help smiling at his own complete haplessness, both now and on the night in question."I will concede that my recent trips to the Leased Territories have not left me disposed to make any more. "This comment produced just the right sort of clubby, knowing smiles from his interlocutors.Hackworth continued, "I saw no reason to report the mugging to Atlantan authorities "  "There was no reason," Major Napier said."Shanghai Police might have been interested, though. ""Ah.Well, I did not report it to them either, simply because of their reputation. "This bit of routine wog bashing would have elicited naughty laughter from most.Hackworth was struck by the fact that neither Finkle McGraw nor Napier rose to the bait."And yet," Napier said, "Lieutenant Chang belied that reputation, did he not, when he went to the trouble of bringing your hat now worthless to you in person, when he was off duty, rather than simply mailing it or for that matter throwing it away. ""Yes," Hackworth said, "I suppose he did. ""We found it rather singular.While we would not dream of enquiring into the particulars of your conversation with Lieutenant Chang, or of prying into your affairs in any other way, it did occur to some suspicious minds here ones that have perhaps been exposed to the Oriental milieu for too long that Lieutenant Chang's intentions might not be entirely honourable, and that he might bear watching.At the same time, for your own protection, we decided to keep a motherly eye on you during any later sojourns beyond the dog pod grid. "Napier did some more scrawling on his paper.Hackworth watched his pale blue eyes jumping back and forth as various records materialized on its surface."You took one more trip to the Leased Territories actually, across the Causeway, across Pudong, into the old city of Shanghai," Napier said, "where our surveillance machinery either malfunctioned or was destroyed by countermeasures.You returned several hours later with a chunk taken out of your arse. "Napier suddenly slapped the paper down on his desk, looked up at Hackworth for the first time in quite a while, blinking his eyes a couple of times as he refocused, and relaxed against the sadistically designed wooden back of his chair."Hardly the first time that one of H. M.  subjects has gone for a nocturnal prowl on the wild side and come back having suffered a beating but normally the beatings are much less severe, and normally they are bought and paid for by the victim.My assessment of you, Mr.Hackworth, is that you are not interested in that particular vice. ""Your assessment is correct, sir," Hackworth said, a bit hotly.This self vindication left him in the position of having to provide some better explanation of the puckered cicatrice running across his buttocks.Actually, he didn't have to explain anything this was an informal luncheon, not a police interrogation but it would not do much for his already tatterdemalion credibility if he let it pass without comment.As if to emphasize this fact, both of the other men were now silent for some time."Do you have any more recent intelligence about the man named Chang?"Hackworth asked."It is singular that you should ask.As it happens, the whilom Lieutenant; his colleague, a woman named Pao; and their superior, a magistrate named Fang, all resigned on the same day, about a month ago.They have resurfaced in the Middle Kingdom. ""You must have been struck by the coincidence that a judge who is in the habit of caning people enters the service of the Middle Kingdom, and shortly thereafter, a New Atlantan engineer returns from a visit to said clave bearing marks of having been caned. ""Now that you mention it, it is quite striking," Major Napier said.The Equity Lord said, "It might lead one to conclude that the engineer in question owed some debt to a powerful figure within that clave, and that the judicial system was being used as a sort of collection agency. "Napier was ready for his leg of the relay."Such an engineer, if one existed, might be surprised to know that John Zaibatsu is intensely curious about the Shanghainese gentleman in question an honest to god Mandarin of the Celestial Kingdom, if he is who we think he is and that we have been trying for some time, with little success, to obtain more information about his activities.So, if the Shanghainese gentleman were to request that our engineer partake in activities that we would normally consider unethical or even treasonous, we might take an uncharacteristically forgiving stance.Provided, that is, that the engineer kept us well informed. ""I see.Would that be something like being a double agent, then?"Hackworth said.Napier winced, as if he were being caned himself."It is a crashingly unsubtle phrase.But I can forgive your using it in this context. ""Would John Zaibatsu then make some kind of formal commitment to this arrangement?""It is not done that way," Major Napier said."I was afraid of that," Hackworth said."Typically such commitments are superfluous, as in most cases the party has very little choice in the matter. ""Yes," Hackworth said, "I see what you mean. ""The commitment is a moral one, a question of honour," Finkle McGraw said."That such an engineer falls into trouble is evidence of mere hypocrisy on his part.We are inclined to overlook this sort of routine caducity.If he goes on to behave treasonously, then that of course is a different matter; but if he plays his role well and provides information of value to Her Majesty's Joint Forces, then he has rather deftly parlayed a small error into a grand act of heroism.You may be aware that it is not unusual for heroes to receive knighthoods, among other more tangible rewards. "For a few moments, Hackworth was too startled to speak.He had expected exile and perhaps deserved it.Mere forgiveness was more than he could have hoped for.But Finkle McGraw was giving him the opportunity for something much greater: a chance to enter the lower ranks of the nobility.An equity stake in the tribal enterprise.There was only one answer he could make, and he blurted it out before he had time to lose his nerve."I thank you for your forbearance," he said, "and I accept your commission.Please consider me to be at Her Majesty's service from this moment forward. ""Waiter!Bring some champagne, please," Major Napier called."I believe we have something to celebrate. "From the Primer, the arrival of a sinister Baron;  Burt's disciplinary practices;  the plot againstthe Baron;  practical application of ideas gleaned from the Primer;  flight.Outside the Dark Castle, Nell's wicked stepmother continued to live as she pleased and to entertain visitors.Every few weeks a ship would sail over the horizon and anchor in the little bay where Nell's father had once kept his fishing boat.An important fellow would be rowed ashore by his servants and would live in the house with Nell's stepmother for a few days, weeks, or months.In the end, she always got into shouting arguments with her visitors, which Nell and Harv could hear even through the thick walls of the Dark Castle, and when the visitor had gotten sick of it, he would row back out to his ship and sail away, leaving the wicked Queen heartbroken and sobbing on the shore.Princess Nell, who had hated her stepmother at first, came to feel sorry for her in a way and to realize that the Queen was locked into a prison of her own making, even darker and colder than the Dark Castle itself.One day a barkentine with red sails appeared in the bay, and a red headed man with a red beard came to shore.Like the other visitors, he moved in with the Queen and lived with her for a time.Unlike the others, he was curious about the Dark Castle and would ride up to its gates every day or two, rattle the door handles, and walk all around it, staring at its high walls and towers.In the third week of the man's visit, Nell and Harv were astonished to hear the twelve locks on the gate being opened, one by one.In walked the red headed man.When he saw Nell and Harv, he was just as astonished as they were."Who are you?"he demanded in a low, gruff voice.Princess Nell was about to answer, but Harv stopped her."You are the visitor here," he said."Identify yourself. "At this, the man's face turned almost as red as his hair, and he strode forward and struck Harv across the face with his mailed fist."I am Baron Jack," he said, "and you may consider that my calling card. "Then, just for spite, he aimed a kick at Princess Nell; but his foot in its heavy metal armor was too slow, and Princess Nell, remembering the lessons Dinosaur had taught her, dodged it easily."You must be the two brats the Queen told me about," he said."You were supposed to be dead by now eaten up by trolls.Well, tonight you shall be, and tomorrow the castle will be mine!"He seized Harv and began to bind his arms with a stout rope.Princess Nell, forgetting her lessons, tried to stop him, and in a flash he had grabbed her by the hair and tied her up as well.Soon both of them were lying helpless on the ground."We'll see how well you can fight off the trolls tonight!"Baron Jack said, and giving each of them a slap and a kick just for spite, he strode off through the gate and locked the twelve locks again.Princess Nell and Harv had a long wait until the sun went down and her Night Friends came to life and untied her and Harv.Princess Nell explained that the evil Queen had a new lover who intended to take the Dark Castle for himself."We must fight him," Purple said.Princess Nell and all the other friends were startled to hear these words, for usually Purple was patient and wise and counseled against fighting."There are many shades of gray in the world," she explained, "and many times when the hidden way is best; but some things are purely evil and must be fought to the death. ""If he were but a man, I could crush him with one foot," Dinosaur said, "but not during the daytime; and even at night, the Queen is a sorceress, and her friends have mickle powers.We will need a plan. "That night there was hell to pay.Kevin, the boy whom Nell had defeated over tetherball, had learned everything he knew about being a bully from none other than Burt, because Burt had lived with Kevin's mom for a while and might even have been Kevin's dad, so Kevin went to Burt and told him that he'd been beaten up by Harv and Nell acting together.That night, both Harv and Nell got the worst spanking of their lives.It went on so long that finally Mom tried to step in and get Burt to calm down.But Burt slapped Mom across the face and shoved her down on the floor.Finally, Harv and Nell ended up in their room together.Burt was in the living room having a few beers and getting into a Burly Scudd ractive.Mom had run out of the apartment, and they had no idea where she was.One of Harv's eyes was swollen shut, and one hand was not working.Nell was terribly thirsty, and when she went to pee, it came out red.Also she had burns on her arms from Burt's cigarettes, and the pain just kept getting worse.They could sense Burt's movements through the wall, and they could hear the Burly Scudd ractive.Harv could tell when Burt had gone to sleep because a single user ractive eventually went into pause mode if the user stopped racting.When they were sure Burt was sleeping, they stole into the, kitchen to get some medicine from the M. C.   Harv got a bandage for his wrist and a cold pack for his eye, and he asked the M. C.  for something to put on their cuts and burns so they wouldn't get infected.The M. C.  displayed a whole menu of mediaglyphs for different kinds of remedies.Some of them were premiums, which you had to pay money for, and there were a few freebies.One of the freebies was a cream that came in a tube, like toothpaste.They took it back to their room and took turns spreading it on each other's cuts and burns.Nell lay quietly in bed until she could tell that Harv had gone to sleep.Then she got out the Young Lady's Illustrated Primer.When Baron Jack came back to the castle the following day, he was angry to find the ropes piled on the ground, and no bones cracked and gnawed by trolls.He stormed into the castle with drawn sword, bellowing that he would kill Harv and Princess Nell himself; but entering into the dining room, he stopped in wonderment as he saw a great feast that had been laid out on the table for him: loaves of brown bread, pots of fresh butter, roasted fowl, a suckling pig, grapes, apples, cheese, broth, and wine.Standing next to the table were Harv and Princess Nell, dressed in servants' uniforms."Welcome to your castle, Baron Jack," Princess Nell said."As you can see, we your new servants have prepared a small snack that we hope will be to your liking. "Actually, Duck had prepared all of the food, but as this was the daytime, she had turned back into a little toy along with all the other Night Friends.Baron Jack's anger subsided as his greedy eyes traveled over the feast."I will try a few bites," he said, "but if any of the food is not perfect, or if you do not serve me to my liking, I'll have your heads spiked on the gates of the castle like that!"and he snapped his fingers in Harv's face.Harv looked angry and was about to blurt out something terrible, but Princess Nell remembered the words of Purple, who said that the hidden way was best, and she said in a sweet voice, "For imperfect service we would deserve nothing better. "Baron Jack began to eat, and such was the excellence of Duck's cooking that once he started, he could barely stop himself.He sent Harv and Nell scurrying back to the kitchen again and again to bring him more food, and though he constantly found fault with them and rose from his chair to give them beatings, he had apparently decided that they were worth more to him alive than dead."Sometimes he would burn their skin with cigarettes too," Nell whispered.The letters changed on the page of the Primer."Princess Nell's pee pee turned red too," Nell said, "because the Baron was a very bad man.And his real name wasn't Baron Jack.His real name was Burt. "As Nell spoke the words, the story changed in the Primer."And Harv couldn't use his arm because of the wrist, so he had to carry everything with one hand, and that's because Burt was a bad man and he hurt it really bad," Nell said.After a long silence, the Primer began to speak again, but the lovely voice of the Vicky woman who told the story sounded thick and hoarse all of a sudden and would stumble in the middle of sentences.Baron Burt ate all day, until finally the sun went down."Bar the doors," said a high squeaking voice, "or the trolls will be after us!"These words came from a little man in a suit and top hat who had just scurried through the doors and was now eyeing the sunset nervously."Who is that pipsqueak interrupting my dinner!?"roared Baron Burt."This is our neighbor," Princess Nell said."He comes to visit us in the evening.Please let him sit by the fire. "Baron Burt looked a bit suspicious, but at this moment Harv set a delicious strawberry cheesecake in front of him, and he forgot about the little man entirely, until a few minutes later, when the high squeaking voice piped up again:  There once was a Baron named Burt  Who was so tough he couldn't be hurt  And could wrestle a bear; but I think  After two or three drinks  Like a child he'd throw up on his shirt."Who dares mock the Baron!?"bellowed Baron Burt, and looked down to see the new visitor leaning insouciantly on his walking stick and raising a glass as if to toast his health.Your Majesty, don't be upset  And please feel free now to get  Into bed; for it's been a long day  And you're in a bad way  And your trousers you're soon going to wet."Bring me a cask of ale!"shouted Baron Burt."And bring another for this upstart, and we'll see who can hold his drink. "Harv rolled two casks of strong ale into the room.Baron Burt raised one to his lips and drained it in single pull.The little man on the floor then did the same.Two skins of wine were then brought, and once again both Baron Burt and the little man easily finished them.Finally, two bottles of strong liquor were brought, and the Baron and the little man took turns drinking one swallow at a time until the bottles were empty.The Baron was confounded by the small man's ability to drink; but there he stood, upright and sober, while Baron Burt was becoming very drunk.Finally the little man pulled a small bottle from his pocket and said,  For a young man, ale is fine  While grown ups much prefer wine  Liquor's a thing  That's fit for a king  But it's kid stuff compared to moonshine.The little man uncorked the bottle and took a drink, then handed it to Baron Burt.The Baron took one swallow and fell asleep instantly in his chair."Mission accomplished," said the little man, sweeping off his top hat with a deep bow, revealing a set of long furry ears for he was none other than Peter in disguise.Princess Nell ran back to the kitchen to tell Dinosaur, who was sitting by the fire with a long wooden pole, poking it in the coals and turning it round and round to make the point very sharp."He's asleep!"she whispered.Miranda, sitting in her stage at the Parnasse, felt an overwhelming sense of relief as her next line appeared on the prompter.She took a deep breath before she delivered it, closed her eyes, settled her mind, tried to put herself there in the Dark Castle.She looked deep into Princess Nell's eyes and sold the line with every scrap of talent and technique she had."Good!"said Dinosaur."Then the time has come for you and Harv to flee from the Dark Castle!You must be as stealthy as you can.I will come out later and join you. "Please get out of there.Please run away.Get out of thatchamber of horrors where you've been living, Nell, and get to anorphanage or a police station or something, and I will find you.Nomatter where you are, I'll find you.Miranda had it worked out already: she could compile an extra mattress, put Nell on the floor of her bedroom and Harv in the living room of her flat.If only she could figure out who the hell they were.Princess Nell hadn't responded.She was thinking, which was the wrong thing to do right now.Get out.Get out.
