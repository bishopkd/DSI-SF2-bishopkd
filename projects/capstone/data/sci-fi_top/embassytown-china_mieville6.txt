This is chance.A cosmic balls up.MagDa hadnt equalised.I saw broken veins beneath the eyes of one and one only, and new lines beside the mouth of the other.This is just a glitch between two evolutions, they said.How would they accommodate it?This doesnt mean anything.Theyll listen themselves to death before theyll try to change.The Hosts had always been incomprehensible.In that one sense, nothing had altered.The upper floors of the Embassy had become a moral ruin.A little farther down, I saw Mag and Da cajole the Ariekei who came, force them to focus just long enough that we could be sure theyd understood our requests, for materials and expertise.And in return, what was it MagDa offered?Have it say about colour, I thought I heard one Host say.It will, MagDa said.You will bring us the tool animals before tomorrow and we will make sure it describes every colour of the walls.We keep going through colours for them, Mag said to me.Theyre loving it, Da said.But eventually......the piquancy of its going to wear off.After this exchange I made new sense of EzRas little speeches to the city.Someone would generally translate.Some nodded to logic.Others were random sentences, or statements of preference or condition.Im tired, subject verb object like childrens grammars.What Id previously thought whims of subject I realised might be gifts for particular Ariekene listeners, in return for this or that favour.Economies and politics.In the Embassy corridors, Ra, that impossible not doppel, joined MagDa and me.Mag and Da kissed him.His presence meant we were approached by people desperate for some kind of intercession.He was as kind to them as he could be.Id seen too many messiahs thrown up by Embassytown.How long do we have to go on?one distraught woman asked him.Until the relief, he said.So many hundreds of thousands of hours, scratching out an interstitial living while the Hosts hankered for EzRas sounds.Then what?the woman said.Then what?Do we leave?No one answered.I saw MagDas faces.I thought of what life would be, for them, in the out.Reliefs had arrived on catastrophised worlds before.No communications could warn; theres no outracing an immer ship.No crew could know what theyd see when their doors opened.There were famous cases of trade vessels emerging from immer to find charnel grounds on once established colonies.Or disease, or mass insanity.I wondered how it would be for our incoming captain to emerge in our orbit, as close as she or he dared to the Ariekene pharos.If we were lucky, that ship would find a populace desperate to become refugees.MagDa in the out?CalVin?Or even Mag and Da and Cal and Vin?What would they do?And they were among the most collected of the Ambassadors.By then most others were falling, to various degrees, apart.They go into the city, MagDa told me when we were alone.She was talking about Ambassadors.Those of them who can still pull themselves together a bit.They go in, and find Hosts.Ones theyve always worked with.Or they just...stand between buildings.And they just start to talk.They shook their heads.They go in groups of two or three or four Ambassadors and just......they just...they try......to make the Ariekei listen.They looked at me.We did it once, ourselves.Early on.But the Ariekei wouldnt listen.They understood, and might even answer.But they would always go back to waiting for EzRas announcements.The vespcams got everywhere, wouldnt let Ambassadors hide their breakdowns.Id seen footage of JoaQuin howling, and speaking Language, and in their misery losing their rhythm with each other, so the Ariekes to which they desperately tried to talk didnt understand them.Did you hear about MarSha?MagDa said.I remember nothing about their voices that warned me that they were about to say anything shocking.They killed themselves.I stopped in my work.I leaned on the table and looked at MagDa slowly.I couldnt speak.I put my hand over my mouth.MagDa watched me.Therell be others, they said quietly, at last.When the ship comes, I thought, I could leave.WHERES WYATT?I asked Ra.Jail.Just up the corridor from Ez.Still?Are they...debriefing him...or what?Ra shrugged.Wheres Scile?I had not seen, nor heard from, nor heard of, my husband, since the start of this ruinous time.Dont know, Ra said.You know I dont really know him, right?There was always a crowd of Staff around us when we were talking...before.I dont even know if Id recognise him.I dont even know who he is, let alone where he is.I descended, passed searchers looking through a room full of papers for useful things.We were doing a lot of scavenging.More floors down, and I heard someone call my name.I stopped.It was Cal, or Vin, in the entrance to a stairwell.He blocked my way and stared at me.I heard you were around here, he said.He was alone.I frowned.His aloneness continued.He took my hands.It was months since wed spoken.I kept looking around him and I kept frowning.I dont know where he is, he said.Close, Im sure.Hell be here soon.I heard you were here.This was the one Id meant to wake.He stared with a desperation that made me shudder.I looked down to avoid his eyes and saw something I could barely believe.You turned off your link.I said.Its lights were off.I stared at it.I was looking for you, because...He ran out of anything to say and his voice got to me.I touched his arm.He looked so suddenly needful at that that I couldnt help pitying him.Whats been happening to you?I said.Bad enough for me, but the Ambassadors had become abruptly nothing.In the corridor behind him his doppel appeared.Youre talking to her?he said.He tried to grab his brother, who didnt take his eyes from me but shook his doppel off.Come on.They werent equalised.As with MagDa, I could see differences.They whispered an altercation and the newcomer backed away.Cal.The first man, the half who had sought me out, said, looking at me.Cal.He pointed at his brother, at the other end of the corridor.He prodded his own chest with his thumb.Vin.I knew his look of longing wasnt, or wasnt just, for me.I met it.Vin walked backwards to join his brother, looking at me for several seconds before he turned.12  I TRAVELLED INTO the city with MagDa and Staff, part of a group trying to keep a paralysed Embassytown alive.Aeolius on me exhaling air I could breathe, I walked at last into that geography.We couldnt risk corvids: the systems in place to ensure safe landing were now too often not operated.We couldnt waitour biorigged medical equipment, our food tech, the living roots and pipes of our water system needed Ariekene attention.And I think there was also in us something that needed to keep checking, to try to test what was happening.Like mythical polar explorers, or the pioneers of Homo diaspora, we trudged in formation, carrying trade goods.The architecture quivered as we came and related to us as germs in a body.Ariekei saw us.They murmured, and MagDa spoke to them, and often they would respond in ways that suggested they hardly knew we were there.We were not relevant.We went past the speakers Staff had helped to place, and around each of them, though they were currently silent, were gatherings of Ariekei.These were the furthest gone: we were learning to distinguish degrees of addiction.They would wait there for more sound, whispering to each other and to the speakers, repeating whatever they had last heard EzRa speak.Ra had to cajole and threaten Ez into their performances, now.One concessionbecause Ez was treated like a capricious child, with castor oil and sugarwas, within the limits of barter necessity, to let Ez decide what they would say.What we would hear translated into Language, then, were rambling discussions of Ezs past.If EzRa spoke during one of our trips into the city we couldnt escape listening to them.Christ knows what Ra thought as he spoke these platitudes that Ez wanted his audience to get drunk on....I always felt different from the others around me, the Ariekei listeners would repeat.We would walk past a patchwork of Ezs ego in scores of voices.She never understood me...,...so it was my turn...,...things would never be the same again...It was almost unbearable to hear the Ariekei say these things.Ez, I realised, built up an arc over many days.These werent disparate anecdotes: it was an autobiography.And that, I heard in an Ariekene voice, was where the trouble really started, and what happened next youll have to wait to hear.Ez was ending each session on a cliffhanger, as if that was what kept his listeners avid.They would have listened no less hard had he expounded details of import duties or bylaws on construction specifications or dreams or shopping lists.WE WOULD MAKE our way to some nursery for the processing of bioriggage, a cremator full of memory, a residence or leviathan hearthlair or wherever, and when we found through the efforts of MagDa or another Ambassador the Host for which we were looking, there would follow careful discussion.It was a tortured business, negotiation with an exot addict.But we would generally achieve something.And in the company of a Host or with a cage full of the tool parasites our maintenance needed, or with plans or the maps we were learning to use and draw, we would retrace our way.It was always a full days expedition.The city would react vividly to us, walls sweating, window ventricles opening.The ears that each house had grown would flex with expectation.That was another reason we preferred not to be outside when EzRa broadcast.I wasnt alone in finding the gluttony of the architecture and its inhabitants, the frantic eavesdropping of the walls, horrible.Order was tenuous and dangerous but there: this wasnt the collapse it so might have been.The ship would come.Until then we lived on the brink.When we left, we would leave a world of desperate Ariekei crawling in withdrawal.I couldnt think about that, or what would happen after that.It would be a long time until we had the luxury of guilt.I met the same Ariekei more than once on our expeditions.Their nicknames were Scissors; RedRag; Skully.If EzRas broadcast sounded they would snap to as utterly as any other Ariekei.But other times they did their best with us: a cadre was emerging among the Hosts who were, perhaps, our counterparts; trying, from their side, to keep things going.Harder for them, given that they were afflicted.IN EMBASSYTOWN we had countertendencies, now, to the drive toward collapse.Schools and crches started running again.Though no one knew yet on quite what basis our economy worked any more, shiftparents mostly kept care of their charges, and our hospitals and other institutions continued.Out of necessity our town didnt fuss about the lines of profit or accounting that had previously driven its production and its distribution.I mustnt give the impression that it was healthy.Embassytown was violently dying.When we citynauts returned it was to streets that werent safe.Constables escorted us.We couldnt punish those determined to party their way to the end of the world.Besides, all of us sometimes went to their convivials.(I wondered if Id meet Scile at any: I never did. )The curfew was unforgiving, though.Constables even left some dead, their bodies censored by pixellation on our news channels.There were fights in Embassytown, and assaults, and murders.There were suicides.There are fashions in suicide, and some of ours were dramatic and melancholy.More than one person took what was known as the Oates Road, strapping on a mask to breathe and simply walking out of Embassytown, and on, out of sight and into the city; even, some stories had it, out beyond it; to let what would, happen.But the most common choice for those oppressed to death by the new times was hanging.According to what protocols Ive no idea, news editors decided that those mostly bloodless bodies could be shown without digital disguise.We grew used to shots of dangling dead.The news didnt report the suicides of Ambassadors.MagDa showed me footage of the bodies of Hen and Ry, lying entangled on their bed, intertwined by the spasms caused by poison.Where are ShelBy?I said.ShelBy and HenRy had been together.Gone, MagDa said.Theyll turn up, Mag said.Da said: Dead.HenRy wont be the last.They wont be able to hide this sort of thing much longer.In fact, given the population size......the rates higher than average.Were killing ourselves more than others.Well, I said.All business.I suppose its no wonder.No, its not, is it?MagDa said.It really isnt.Is it any wonder?WE DRAGOONED some of Embassytowns transient machines, uploading what ware we could to make them less stupid.Still they were unfit for all but basic tasks.Ehrsul would still not answer my buzzes, or, I learnt, anyones.I realised how many days it was since Id seen her, was ashamed and abruptly fearful.I went to her apartment.Alone: I wasnt the only one from the new Staff who knew her, but if any of the worst outcomes I suddenly pictured were true, I could only bear to find out, to find her, on my own.But she opened her door to my knocking almost immediately.Ehrsul?I said.Ehrsul?She greeted me with her usual sardonic humour, as if her name hadnt been a question.I could not understand.She asked me how Id been, said something about her work.I let her blather a while, getting me a drink.When I asked her what shed been doing, where shed been, why she hadnt responded to my messages, she ignored me.Whats going on?I said.I demanded to know what she made of our catastrophe.I asked, and her avatar face simply froze, flickered, and came back, and she continued her meaningless tasks and directionless wit.She said nothing to my question at all.Come with me, I said.I asked her to join MagDa and me.I asked her to come with me into the city.But whenever I mooted anything that would mean her leaving her room, the same stuttering fugue occurred.She would skip a moment, then continue as if Id said nothing, and talk about something outdated or irrelevant.Its either a fuckup of some kind or shes doing it deliberately, a harried Embassy waregener told me later, when I described it to her.You think?I was about to respond, but she clarified: it might be an autom equivalent of a child singing I cant hear you, with fingers in its ears.When I left Ehrsuls, I saw a letter in front of her door, opened and discarded.She didnt acknowledge it, even as I bent very slowly to pick it up, right in front of her, looking at her the whole time.Dear Ehrsul, it read.Im worried about you.Of course whats going ons got us all terrified, but Im concerned...and so on.Ehrsul waited while I read.What must my expression have been?I was holding my breath, certainly.Her avatar stuttered in and out of focus until I was done.I didnt recognise the name at the letters end.I saw from the way it fluttered, minutely, when I bent to put it back on the floor, that my fingers were shaking.How many best friends had she collected?Maybe I was her uptown version, linked to Staff.Perhaps each of us had a niche.Perhaps all of us had been afraid for her.Thinking about her made me think also of CalVin, of whatever pointless actions they were performing, and of Scile, from whom I had still heard nothing.I buzzed Bren, repeatedly, but to my infuriation and concern he didnt answer.I went back to his house but no one came to the door.I DONT THINK Id understood what Ra dealt with until I was on Ez duty.We could of course have simply held a gun to Ezs head, but when we threatened too hard, he threatened us back, and his behaviour was so unpredictable we had to take seriously the possibility that hed refuse to speak, and damn us all, out of spite.So instead we chaperoned him everywhere, at once jailers, companions and foils.That way when it was time for him to perform, he could make our lives hard, and we could let him kick us around, until, sulkily, he acquiesced.Security was always in at least twos.I asked to join Simmon.When I met him he gripped my right hand in greeting with his left.I stared.The right arm hed worn for years, an Ariekene biorigged contrivance of imprecise colour and texture but exactly mimicking Terre morphology, was gone.The sleeve of his jacket was neatly pinned.It was addicted, he said.When I was charging it it mustve...He had used a zelle, like the Hosts and their city.It was sort of spasming.It tried to grow ears, he said.I cut it off.It was still trying to listen, even lying there on the floor..Ez was in EzRas Embassy chambers.He was drunk and wheedling, excoriating Ra for cowardice and conspiracy, calling MagDa filthy names.Nasty but no nastier than many arguments Id heard.Ra was what surprised me.He stood differently than Id seen him do before.He whom we often mocked for his taciturnity spat back epithets.Make sure hes ready to speak when he gets back, Ra said to us.Ez gesticulated an obscenity at him.Can I at least go to a party?Or will you bastards try to keep me even from that?Ez moaned as we followed him to the venue in the Embassys lower floors.We stood watch, policed the drink he took, though wed never seen excess seem to alter his abilities to speak Language.We watched him fuck and argue.The glints on his link puttered frantically, hunting for and not finding its pair, striving to boost a connection Ez was avoiding.I could say it was depressing, that party, like a walk through purgatory, we at the end of the world rutting into oblivion and drugging ourselves idiot to autogenerated rhythms and a hammer of lights through smoke.Perhaps to those participating it was joyful.It didnt hold Ezs interest.I was as impassive as a soldier.Ez took us to what had been an office equipment warehouse in the middle floors of the Embassy and was now an ersatz bar.He drank until I intervened, which made him delighted because then he could denounce me.The only people in this peculiar thrown together place were ex Staff and one or two Ambassadors.They showed no concern that he was risking our world with every glass.Your friends, I whispered, and shook my head.He met my eyes quite unmoved by the disgust.Embassytowners had taken over the lower floors of the Embassy, looking for safety.Those levels had become back alleys.Men and women, nurseries and shiftparents reconfigured cupboards and spilled out of meeting rooms, turning architecture inside out.We went walking through these night streets made of corridors, where lights not broken had been reprogrammed into diurnal rhythms and house numbers were chalked on inside doors by which people leaned and talked while children played games past their bedtime.Embassytown had come inside.Sotted and maudlin, Ez began to badmouth Ra.That lanky shit, he muttered as we followed him through semiautonomous zones policed by their own incompetent constables.Coattailing me, then coming the big I am.Ra was the only person in Embassytown who shared Ezs colloquialisms and accent.Dont you see what hes doing?Easy for him to play the nice boy when, with...he can...Cheap lamps flickered above us, new stars.I shouldnt...Ez said.Im tired, and I want to stop this...and I want Ra to leave me alone.I said, Ez, I dont think I know what you mean.Please stop calling me that!Fucking stupid, stupid...Its...I knew his former name.He was the man who had been Joel Rukowsi.I looked at him in the rubbish specked hall.I wouldnt call him Rukowsi, or Joel, and when I repeated his name Ez he slumped and accepted it.Simmon and I rescued him from the fights he provoked.When it was time eventually for him and Ra to perform their dawn chorus, the first speech of the day, he insulted us as we led him back up through the changed building, through new fiefdoms, embryonic slums, where new ways of living were incubating.At the chamber I reached for the door, and Ez halted me with a touch and without speaking asked me for a moment.That was the only time that night I felt anything from him other than scorn.He closed his eyes.He sighed and his face went back to drunk and ornery.Come on then, you bastard, he shouted, and shoved open the door.Ra and MagDa were waiting.They disentangled while Ez mocked them.We watched EzRa fight.When Ez made some prurient cruel comment about MagDa, Ra shouted at him.What do you think you are?Ez laughed back.What do you think this is?You leave her out of this!?Are you serious?Even I had to bite back a bit of laughter at that unexpected imitation, and Ra seemed a little shamefaced.Here, said Ez later, as sound engineers and bioriggers prepared him for broadcast.Ra read the paper Ez handed him.Not going to go over that stuff from yesterday?Ra said.His voice was suddenly and surprisingly neutral.No, said Ez.I want to keep on.I think I left it at a good moment, lets keep things going.They dont care!I wanted to shout.You could describe the fucking carpet, the effect would be the same.Ra asked questions about cadence and timing, wrote notes in the margin.Ez had no copy: hed memorised what he wanted to say.When they spoke I wasnt looking at them but over the city, and it twitched as the first hit of language came, as EzRa continued with their stories of Ezs youth.13  CYNICALLY, WHO WERE WE?Not many, a gathering of no ones, floakers, dissident Staff, a handful of precious Ambassadors.But our numbers were growing, and our edicts werent completely ignored.Embassytowners had begun to do as we suggested, asked, or ordered.WeMagDa above allworked hard at our few Ariekei contacts.We worked hard full stop, too hard for me to feel just then whatever it was I ultimately probably would, from Ezs abuse, from reading Ehrsuls letter.MagDa even persuaded some of the most contained and coherent Ariekei into the corridors of the Embassy, not simply on eager pilgrimage to EzRa, but on new business.She might reward them with a snip of unheard recording of EzRa, one of our rare stolen buggings.Some of them know this is a problem, said Mag.The Ariekei.You can tell.Some of them, said Da....theres some kind of debate, some kind of...Some of them want to be cured.Like fucking fungus, rumours spread.Our cams still gusted through the city.Some were intercepted by the antibodies the houses secreted, which came up like segmented predators.But when their investigations left them satisfied that the cams were no threat, they left them unmolested.The footage taught us more about our Hosts city than we had ever known: too late.And every little half seen movement, everything we saw out there, the what and where of which we couldnt identify or clarify, gave traction to stories about missing secrets, fifth columns, Staff self exiled, old grudges.In the farmlands, huge flocks of biorigging spawned in irregular harvests.Foods and tech came from those stretches by biotic ways.Addiction was chemical: there was a slow stream of it from the city to the kraals and the rural Ariekei.They began to neglect their charges and come to the city, for the sound they suddenly needed without ever having heard.Their deserted manors grew sick, wheezing and hungry.Herds of rigged equipment, medical tech and building tools, girdered and rhino sized spinners of protein and polymer foundations, went feral.When their shepherds reached the city there was no one to meet them.The country Ariekei saw their worst afflicted compatriots lying by speakers and starving to death, waiting for the next sentence.Their bodies lay unhonoured.If the buildings around them were still healthy enough their dog sized animalculae would break the corpses down: if not, the slower processes of internal rot would smear them gradually into the road.Fights were common.Withdrawal and Ariekene need meant aggression.The afflicted would tear into things on sudden searches for EzRas Language.A less affected Ariekes, usually from the country, might frill its fanwing in formal pugnacity, but the more addicted had no time for traditional displays and would simply hurl themselves hooves and giftwings at their startled opponents.Once I saw footage of EzRas broadcast start in the middle of such a battle.The combatants slumped against each other immediately and coiled together as if in affection, still bleeding their blood.Things are getting worse again, Da said.We were going to infect the entire planet.Thats not the only thing we have to contend with.It was Bren.He stood in the doorway.A suspiciously perfect pose, all framed.Hello Avice Benner Cho, he said.I rose.I shook my head at him.You prodigal bastard, I said.Prodigal?he said.Where have you been?Prodigal extravagant?he said.Or penitent?A little cautiously, he smiled at me.I didnt quite smile at him for a minute, but then, fuck it, yes I did.HOW DID YOU get in here?someone said, so newly promoted by circumstance that they added Who are you?to hisses of embarrassment.Ra shook Brens hand and tried to welcome him.Bren waved him away.Its not just these Ariekene refugees we have to contend with, Bren said.Though theyll certainly complicate matters.He spoke with monotone authority.There are other things.Of course he couldnt speak Language since his doppel had died, but there were some Ariekeiyou might sentimentally and misleadingly call them old friendsthat came to his house and told him things.Do you think none of them want this to change?Bren said.No, we know, Mag said, but he continued.You think there are no Hosts who are horrified?Theyre thinking through a fug, true, but some of them are still thinking.You know what they call EzRa?The god drug.After a silence I said carefully, That is a kenning.No, Bren said.He glanced around the room, gauging who knew that old term for the compound trope.Its not like a bone house, Avice.He thumped his chest, his bone house.Its more straightforward.Its just truth.Huh, someone said shakily, thats religion for you...No it is not, Bren said.Gods are gods and drugs are drugs but here, here, theres a city not only of the addicted but of...a sort of faithful.They dont have gods, I said.How...?He interrupted me.Theyve known about them ever since we got here and told them what they are and what they do.They couldnt talk about voidcraft or trousers either, before we arrived, but they find ways now.And there are some Hosts wholl do anything to stop this.That might not be much yet, maybe, until they can get themselves free enough to try to free themselves more.But if they do, well.Theyll end it however they can.You should think of all the ways a few determined Ariekei might try to...liberate...afflicted compatriots.He joined me again, in private, that night, in my rooms.He asked me where was my friend Ehrsul and I told him that I didnt know.That was almost all I said that night.Bren himself didnt have much to say, but he had come, and we sat together while he said it.I LEFT THE CITY.Three times.Seeing those immigrant Ariekei from the outlands gave us ideas.There were some which hadnt yet left their homesteads but had started to yearn for EzRas pronouncements.We went to them.Our craft had ventricles through which I could put my head and look down as we flew.It exuded air in its belly bridge, pressurised enough that the bad atmosphere couldnt push in.I took breaths, then put my head out to watch the ground.A kilometre below, the demesnes of the Host city.Plateaus and cultivation and simple massive rocks, fractured, their fractures filled with black weedstuff.Meadows crossed with tracks and punctuated by habitations.More grown architecture: rooms suspended by gas sacs watched us as we flew, with simple eyes.Leaving Embassytown and then the city felt as dramatic as entering immer.It might have been beautiful.Swaying through fields, even now during the breakdown, farms ambled hugely after their keepers if they still had them, or alone.Symbionts cleaned their pelts.The farms would birth components or biomachines in wet cauls.Orchards of lichen were crisscrossed with the gut pipework that spanned out from the city, still looked after in places by tenacious Host tenders.A long way off were steppes where herds of semiwild factories ran, which twice each long year Ariekene scientist gauchos would corral.We hoped to find a few of these cowboy bioriggers left, to trade their creatures offspring.There was I; Henrych, who had been a stallholder and now had joined the new committees; Sarah, with just enough knowledge of science to be useful; BenTham the Ambassador.The Ambassador were unkempt, bewildered and resentful.Unlike several of their fellows, though, they had still enough decorum to ensure that they were exactly equally dishevelled.We landed and from the hillside came the distress call of grass, as our vehicles began to graze.In our aeoli masks we gathered equipment, made camp, called in to Embassytown, established a timetable.Checked once more over the orders and the wish list.I dont think this tribe exchanges many reactor pups, I said, down the line to home.Talk to KelSey.Theyre with the wetland cultivators, arent they?Thats where theyll get them, along with some incinerators.So on.We divided hunting duties between the various crews beyond the city.Our spancarts were skittish, their foreparts stretched in rippling caterpillar motion.We stacked them full of datchips, all sound files.Some were stolen, some made with Ezs grudging consent, when this system had been formulated and mooted to them.I was almost certainly not as calm as this telling would imply.Id been looking down onto the surface of the country I was born in, grew up in, returned to, that was my home, and that, that view beyond Embassytown, had been impossible for me till then.So there was that, and there was what I was doing, and the stakes of it.I was looking into a season and a surface without cognates.Id been into the out, but in homily fashion, my own planet was the most alien place Id seen.Things like crossbred anemones and moths froze as we passed, waved sensory limbs behind us.Our cart rutted toward settlements and animals like rags of paper flew in the hot sky.The farmstead at the end of knotted man thick tributaries of the pipework was as restless as most architecture.A squirming tower laid young machinery in eggs.The paper shred birds picked parasites from it.Its keepers started when they saw us, then galloped for our company.The farm lowed.So far out, the addiction seemed weaker or different.BenTham could communicate our desires and understand theirs.They knew that we might have something they could hear, and they clamoured for that, unsatisfied by the degraded remnants of fix that backwashed down the arteries from the city whenever EzRa spoke, or what they half heard from the nearest speakers, kilometres away, or what previous barterers had offered.We showed our wares, voil , like a peddler in the hills in old books.I played a datchip, and from it, in Language, EzRa said, When my father died I was sad but there was a freedom in it too.The Hosts reared and said something.Theyve got this one, BenTham said.Theyd played it many times, and it had no more effect: they at last heard it for its content, and they didnt care about Ezs father.We offered other bits from his history, cliches of diplomacy, idle thoughts, weather reports.We gave them for free.We are very happy about the increased opportunities for technical assistance, and tempted them with the first few phonemes of I broke my leg when I fell out of a tree.Theyre asking if we have the one about unacceptable levels of wastage in the refinement industry, Ben or Tham said.They heard about it from neighbours.Husbanding carefully, we gave them enough to buy the biorigging we needed, and some expertise, some explanations.Doing so we spread the addiction, too: we knew that.We brought out pure product, EzRa speech, and these as yet only half affected outlanders would succumb.I made a similar journey twice more after that first time.Soon afterwards, another of our buoyant dirigible beasts didnt return.When at last our cams found it they reeled back to us footage and trid of it dead and strewn in burnt out flesh and a slick of guts across the countryside.There drowned in it and shattered, all dead, were our people.Ambassador; navigator; technician; Staff.Id known Ambassador LeNa slightly, one of the crewmembers well.I held my mouth closed with my hands as we watched.We were all affected.We fetched back the bodies and honoured them as well as we could with new ceremonies.Our crews searched the mouldering wreckage.The ship wasnt sick, I dont think, our investigator told us in committee.I dont know what happened.IN EMBASSYTOWN we did our best to stand in the way of warlordism, but we small band of ersatz organisers could only slow a degeneration toward that kind of rule.More Ambassadors were joining us, terrified into organisation, inspired by MagDa.Others of course remained useless.Two more killed themselves.Some deactivated their links.Ez seemed...not calmer perhaps, but more broken, I thought, when I chaperoned him again.Delivering him finally to Ra, though, they argued even more viciously than before.I can make things bad for you, Ez kept shouting.There are things I could say.When we went into the city, we had to pass the corpses of houses and Hosts.The death breakdown of biorigging designed and bred to be immortal contaminated the air with unexpected fumes.We heard more Ariekei fighting around speakers.Some of their dead had died from the violence of the desperate; some, those without enough of the new sustenance they needed, just died; and in some places there were more organised brutalities, cadres exerting new kinds of control.The living grabbed what datchips we gave them: these were rewards for these new tough local organisers, in crude concert with which we were just managing to maintain a tenuous system.One evening as we returned to Embassytown, I lagged behind my colleagues, shaking the mulch of rotting bridges from my boots.I looked back into the Ariekene city, and I saw two human women looking at me.They were only there a second.They stood one to either side of an alley mouth, metres away, looking at me gravely, and then they were gone.I couldnt have described them well, probably not even recognised them again, but I knew that they had had the same face.IT WAS ONLY LATER, when things went wrong all over again and these new routines were made bullshit, that I realised Id come to expect us to muddle through until the ship came and flew us all away.One scheduled evening we could find neither Ez nor Ra at the time of their broadcast.Neither would answer our buzzes.That was like Ez, but it wasnt like Ra.Ez was in none of his preferred places.We searched the dangerous corridors of the Embassy: no one had seen him.We tried to buzz Mag or Da, who were often with Ra, but they wouldnt answer either.We found the four of them in MagDas new rooms, high in the Embassy.There were several of us, constables and new Staff like me.When we turned onto a last stretch of hallway we saw a figure huddled by the apartment door.We levelled our gun things but she didnt move.It was Da.As I approached I thought she was dead.But then she looked up at us, with despair.Into the rooms and to a dreadful scene.Still as a diorama.Mag on the bed, in the same precise pose as Da outside, the wall between them.She looked up at us too, and back at the dead man on the bed with her.It was Ra, quite ruined with blood.A handle emerged from his chest, like a lever.Ez sat a way off, rubbing his head and face, smearing blood on himself, blubbing....I really didnt, it wasnt, oh, God, it was, look, I, Im so, it...he said, and so on.When he saw us, among other emotions I swear I saw shame broader than for one dead man: he knew what hed done to all of us.My hand kept twitching as if Id take the thing out of Ra.Later we found out that at first the argument had been, ostensibly, about MagDa.That was the marshalling of unconvincing, rote things to express other deeper terrors and resentments.The surface specifics didnt really matter.This wasnt about whatever they shouted as they fumbled and implements turned deadly.We werent very used to murder.It wasnt me who closed Ras eyes but it was me who held Mags hand and led her away.There wasnt much time to just grieve: the ramifications of the situation were obvious.I was already thinking of the tiny stock we had of EzRa prerecorded on datchip.When I returned the others were hauling Ez away and taking Da to join her doppel.I secured the scene.I was alone for some minutes with Ras corpse.Did you have to?I said.I think I whispered out loud.I was trying hard to keep myself together and I succeeded.Couldnt you have backed down?I put my hand on Ras face.I looked at him and shook my head and knew that Embassytown and I and all the Embassytowners would die.Part Five  NOTES    14  WE HID THE DEATH for days.We were miserable with secrecy.Thered be panic when Embassytown knew.I couldnt convince myself panic in three days time would be much worse than panic now: still we hid it, like a reflex.We had only a few recordings of EzRa.Ez had been careful.Once we risked repeating a speech that the Ariekei had heard before, but the footage we saw of consternation, the fights we spurred among outraged listeners, frightened us.We didnt try that again.We had perhaps twenty days of broadcasts.When we played them to the city we kept them as brief as we dared.New hierarchies were asserting among the Hosts, from what we could tell.We didnt understand them.After the murder, MagDa equalised again, for the first time in days.They entered the committee room where we were meeting, smart and unsmiling and precisely identical.I couldnt tell if it was a good or a bad reaction.In any case it didnt last.They accepted some condolences.Theyd lost no authority, remained our de facto leader, listening, debating, and offering their thoughts and almost orders.Obeying MagDa, and out of some prurience, I became Ezs keeper.He wanted to talk.He maundered through self justification, self disgust, anger, regret.Id sit in the room where he was held and listen.At first I tried to glean the specifics of what had happened.What was it?I asked MagDa once.They looked weary.One of them shook her head and the other said, Thats really not the point.This outcome had been waiting for a long time.Plenty among us advocated simply ending Ez.I and others argued against it.MagDa took our side, which was what settled it.They calculated that an excess of mercy, ultimately, would work for them better than vengefulness.Even at that time when none of us really believed we had a future, MagDa were planning for it.I pitied Ez, though I despised him too, of course.I felt that as shocking an act as hed committed should change someone; that he should emerge either better or fully a monster.That he could kill someone and remain the pathetic figure he was previously shocked me.He was idiotic with resentment.He responded to all my questions with a childs churlishness.He wanted to continue telling me about his life, as he had the Hosts, with Ra, in Language.He picked up where they had left off.He didnt come clean about much.He didnt tell us whatever his original task had been, that I was sure hed had, hisand Rasintended role to undermine Embassytowns power.His motivations for this secrecy were obscure: all motivations are.I dont know how the news of Ras deaththat he had, I suppose, technically, become got out, but word of his death, and therefore that of EzRa, did spread.A guard; a rogue vespcam; an Ambassador; a doppel saying it to a momentary partner, just because it was something that could be said.The knowledge just seemed to well up in Embassytown.On the fourth day after Ras death I woke to church bells.Sects were calling their faithful.Soon, I knew, the mere knowledge that there was nothing we Staff could do wouldnt stop the crowds from marching on us to demand we did anything.Embassytown would fall, perhaps even before the craving Ariekei came for us.In the time that was my own, for various reasons, foremost among them a sudden urgency, a sense that he might understand all this from his weird perspective, might help me or want help, I started hunting again for Scile.After what CalVin had done with Sciles collaboration, Id tried to avoid finding out which other Ambassadors were complicit in s execution.I couldnt face thinking about it.Cowardice or pragmatism, I dont know.In these later days that ignorance was a relief: it was hard enough to live in Embassytown right then without relating to my new colleagues with that murder in mind.I did at last meet CalVin, at a gathering of Ambassadors, both those on MagDas committee and those too dissolute or afraid to be.I went straight to them.Where is he?I asked Vin.Scile.This time I didnt mistake him for his doppel.Neither of them answered me.BREN BUZZED ME.People are being attacked.In Carib Alley.A corvid took constables, MagDa and me to the flashpoint in Embassytowns outskirts.Bren was there already, on the ground, waving us down, torch in his hand: it was night.Down a small street Ariekei were clamouring outside a block.A small group of Terre were inside.They hadnt joined the exodus from this area.Idiots, someone said.The Ariekei were hurling things: rubbish, rock, glass.They each gripped the door in turn, frustrated by its mechanism.They were shouting in Language.EzRas voice.Where is it?This lot are the weakest, Bren said.Theyre too far gone to be satisfied with what we give them now.We were increasingly parsimonious with the recorded god drug.They know there are Terre here, must think theyre holding EzRas voice, on datchip or something.Dont look like that.This isnt about logic.Theyre desperate.Vespcams gathered.We watched their feeds.What do you feel, witnessing the end?In my case it wasnt despair but disbelief and shock, endlessly.There, stepped into red mud by the hooves of the Ariekei, was a Terre body.A pulped man.I wasnt the only one who cried out at that sight.The cams darted closer.One was slapped from the air by an irate giftwing.Constables touched their weapons but what, would we attack the Ariekei?We couldnt retaliate.We didnt know what that would invoke.Officers reached the rear of the buildings, made surreptitious entrances, got the terrified inhabitants away.We watched in split visuals: them with their charges; the Hosts clamouring as they attacked the house.There was more motion.Ariekei newcomers were approaching.There, said Bren.He wasnt surprised by what he saw.There were four or five new arrivals.I thought they were coming to join the attack on the house, but to my great shock they shoved in a wedge into the crowd of Ariekei with their giftwings whipping.They reared and slammed hooves into their fellows, shattering carapaces.The fight was fast and brutal.Ariekene blood sprayed, and there were the calls of Hosts in pain.Look.I pointed.The cameras flitted and gave me another moments view of some of the new attackers.Do you see?They were without fanwings.They had only stumps, flesh rags.Bren hissed.The traumatised human inhabitants made it to our flyer, joined us watching that new fight.The attackers killed one of the other Ariekei.Seeing it die made me think of Beehive.The Host lay there red with hoofprints in familiar gore: its attacker had slipped in what remained of the Terre man.So...we have Ariekene protectors, now?I said.No, Bren said.Thats not what you just saw.WE MOVED the last people from the edges of Embassytown, into blocks we could guard with constables and rapidly inducted militia.Some holdouts we forced to leave.Ariekei gathered at the ends of streets and watched their human neighbours go.We timed a broadcast of EzRa to coincide with our evacuation: the double voice called and the Ariekei reeled and stampeded to the speakers and left us alone.Between the ruining city and the centre of Embassytown was a deserted zone: our buildings, our houses without men and women in them, valuables taken and only the shoddy and dispensable left behind.I helped supervise the exodus.Afterwards, in the thin air at the edge of the aeoli breath, I walked through half empty rooms.Power was still connected.In some places screens and flats had been left on, and newscasters talked to me, describing the very removals that had left them alone, interviewing Mag and Da, who nodded sternly and insisted that this was necessary, temporarily.I sat in empty homes and watched my friends dissemble.I picked up books and trinkets and put them down again.Ehrsuls rooms were in this zone.I stood outside them, and after a long time I buzzed her.I rang her doorbell.It was the first time Id tried her in a long time.She didnt answer.The Ariekei began to move into the emptied streets.A vanguard of their most desperate.With their pining battery animals, and followed by slow carrion eaters they would have bothered to kill as pests before, the Hosts searched the houses, too.They pressed with incomprehension and care at computers, their random ministrations running no longer relevant programs, cleaning rooms, working out finances, playing games, organising the minutiae of those missing.The Ariekei found no Language to listen to.The absence of their drug didnt wean them off it: there was no cold turkey for them; EzRas speech had insinuated too deep into them for that.Instead, more of the weakest of them just began to die.Among the Terre, Ambassador SidNey committed suicide.Avice.Bren buzzed me.Can you come to my house?HE WAS WAITING for me.Two women were with him.They were older than me but not old.One was by the window, one by Brens chair.They watched me as I entered.No one spoke.They were identical.They were doppels.I could discern no differences.They werent just doppels, they were equalised.I was looking at an Ambassador, an Ambassador I did not recognise.And that, I knew, wasnt possible.Yes, Bren said to me.He laughed minutely at my face.I need to talk to you, he said.I need you to keep quiet about something.Well, about...One of the women came towards me.She held out her hand.Avice Benner Cho, she said.Obviously this is a shock, her doppel said.Oh no, I said finally.A shock?Please.Avice.Bren said.Avice, this is Yl.I learnt the spelling later.It sounded like ill.And this is Sib.Their faces exactly those of each other, heavy and shrewd, but they wore different clothes.Yl was in red, Sib in grey.I shook my head.They both wore little aeoli, unhooked and resting in our Embassytown air.I saw you, I remembered.Once, in...I pointed at the city.Probably, said Sib.I dont remember, said Yl.Avice, Bren said.YlSib are here to...Theyre how I know whats going on.YlSibwhat an ugly name.I knew as he said it that theyd once been Ambassador SibYl, and that this recomposition was part of their rebellion.YlSib live in the city, Bren said gently.Of course they did.Hed hinted to me of such hidden.I realised he was saying my name.Avice.Avice.Why me, Bren?I said.I said it quietly enough that it was as if intimate, though Yl and Sib could hear me.Why am I here?Wheres MagDa, where are the others?No, he said.He and Sib and Yl glanced at each other.Too much bad blood.History.YlSib and that lot were on opposite sides for a long time.Some things dont change.But youre different.And I need your help.I was staring into something opened up.Fractures, renegades, guerrilla Ambassadors, unquiet cleaved.What the hell else was out there?Who?Scile?Shiftfather Christmas?Back came stupid tales, now not so stupid.I remembered unanswered questions, I wondered whod gone from Embassytown, whod turned their backs on it, over years, and I wondered why.Embassytowns dying, Yl said.She gestured at the window, and Sib at the soundless wallscreen.The worst, most Language starved Ariekei were coming.They shambled in unnatural bursts like toys.Troops of the collapsing, falling apart variously, claiming our streets without intent, with only oratees despair, but killing as they came, us and each other.We could no longer walk the outermost of our streets: there were too many attacks, too much Ariekene rage.Cams showed those in their dotage instar wandering with pendulous food bellies, some stumbling by their random ways into Embassytown.No Ariekei tended them.It was shocking.There were rumours that in periods between EzRa word highs some Ariekei were eating these unstruggling elders, as evolution intended but their culture had abjured.Even as things fell apart I was desperate to ask YlSib where theyd been, what had happened, what theyd done since they absconded, years ago.Theyd lived so close, maybe in some biorigged dwelling that sweated air at them inside.Did they consult?Had they worked for the Ariekei?Were they independent?Trading in information, go betweens in informal economies of which Id never known a thing?There was no way, I thought, such a hinterland could have been sustained without the patronage of some in Embassytown.You said they werent helping us, I said.Those mad Ariekei that came and attacked the others.Bren said, They werent.YlSib said, Factions are emerging.Some Ariekei cant even think anymore.Theyre dying.Those are the ones tearing up the outskirts.Then there are some trying to keep some kind of order.Live in new ways.Manage their addiction.Theyre trying all kinds of methods.Desperate stuff.Repeating phrases theyve heard EzRa say, to see if they can give each other fixes.Trying to take control of neighbourhoods.Trying to ration out the broadcasts.Organise different listening shifts for different groups, to keep things more......organised.And then there are dissidents who want to change everything.We have sects, Bren said.So do they, now.Not ones that worship a god, though.Ones that hate it.They know the worlds ending, said YlSib.And some of them want to bring in a new one.They despise the other Ariekei.Thats what you saw.Their word for the addicts was...They said a word together, in Language.They used to call them that, Sib or Yl said, although they cant anymore.It means weak.Sick.It means languid.Lotus eaters.Theyre going to start a new order.How...?I remembered the stubbed and ruined fanwings.They cant call them that anymore, because they cant hear, or speak, theyve no Language.Oh, I. ..I said.Oh, God.They did it to themselves.To escape temptation, Bren said.Its a vicious cure but its a cure.Without hearing, their bodies stop needing the drug.And now, the only thing they hate worse than their afflicted brethren is the affliction.Or, to put it another way, us, said YlSib.If theyd seen you......theyd have killed you faster than they did their own.Theres not many of them, Bren said.Yet.But without EzRa to speak, without the drug, theyre the only Ariekei with a plan.The only Ariekei, Sib said.Weve got one too, though.We have, said Yl, a plan.15  IN THE OUT, Id learnt that our Embassy isnt a huge building.In countries on many planets Id seen much larger: taller, aided by gravity cranes; more sprawling.But it was large enough.I was only slightly surprised to discover that there were whole corridors, whole floors that by convoluted design Id not only never been into but had never suspected were there.You know what to do, YlSib had said to us.You need a replacement.Open the damn infirmary.That was the basis of their idea, the plan that Bren relayed to MagDas committee, as if it were his own.I wasnt clear on why hed introduced me to YlSib, but he was right to trust me.Close to the top of the Embassy, in a set of infolding rooms and halls, was the separated off zone.I followed those who knew the way.The Ambassadors and Staff of the committee looked horrified at Brens suggestion.He insisted, with references incomprehensible to those of the committee ignorant of the infirmary he mentioned.I pretended to be one of them.There could be others in there we can use, Bren said.And how are we supposed to know?said Da.Well, thats a difficulty, hed said.Were going to have to have a test subject.ONLY STREETS AWAY, the anarchy of desperate Ariekei grew worse, and more of our houses fell.Embassytowners still foolishly near the city would turn corners into those ravenous things, who rushed at them and in Language begged them to speak, to sound like EzRa sounded.When they didnt, the Ariekei took hold of them and opened them up.Perhaps in rage, perhaps in some hope that the wanted sound would emerge from the holes they made.I couldnt believe what we were planning.Wed gone by foot into the city, in a snatch squad.Smoke and birds circled above us.Micropolitics were everything in Embassytown by then, groups of men and women enforcing their wills in territories of two or three streets, armed with wrenches, or pistols or pistol beasts crudely rigged, that they shouldnt have had to use, that clenched them too tight, drew blood from the weapon hand.Wheres EzRa then, you fuckers?they shouted when they saw us.Going to fix everything, are you?Some of those posses shouted that they would attack the Hosts.If they did they might take down one or two of the weakest, but against those aggressive self mutilated theyd have no chance.Into the ring of Embassytown we had lost, where the Ariekei had been followed by pet weeds.They were already shaggy or crustlike over what had recently been our architecture.The air here was tainted by theirs.We kept our weapons up.Ariekei saw us, and now it was they who shouted, came forward, ran away.EzRa, EzRa, the voice, where is the voice?Dont kill unless you really have to, said Da.We found a lone Ariekes, turning, pining for words.Come with us, MagDa said.EzRa, the Ariekes said.Come with us, MagDa said, and you will hear EzRa.We buzzed a corvid.It was antique, metal and silicon and polymers: entirely Terretech.We were chary of using our more sophisticated machines now: they were built with a compromise of our traditions and local biorigging, and as addiction spread, they might be tainted.For all we knew they might gush that need if we flew them, in their exhaust, perhaps in the tone of their drone.THE ARIEKES who came with us was called .It was confused and overcome by need for the god drugs voice.It was physically starving, too, though it didnt seem to know it.We gave it food.It followed us because we made promises about EzRa.We took it with us to that infirmary.I wasnt the only ex commoner on the committee, who hadnt known the wing existed.By a series of counter intuitive corridor turns and staircases we arrived at a heavy door.There was even a guard.Security, in this time when all officers were needed.Got your message, Ambassador, he said to MagDa.Im still not sure I can...I. ..He looked at us.He saw the cowed Ariekes with us.Were in martial times, Officer, MagDa said.You dont really think......
