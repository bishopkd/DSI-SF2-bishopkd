One day in September I pulled an alert and got only seven drills manned.Talked it over with Wyoh and Sidris that night.Next day Wyoh wanted to know if Prof and I would okay bolshoi expense money?They formed something Wyoh named "Lysistrata Corps. "Never inquired into duties or cost, because next time I inspected a ready room found three girls and no shortge of drillmen.Girls were in uniform of Second Defense Gunners just as men were (drillmen hadn't bothered much with authorized uniform up to then) and one girl was wearing sargeant's stripes with gun captain's badge.I made that inspection very short.Most girls don't have muscle to be a drillman and I doubted if this girl could wrestle a drill well enough to justify that badge.But regular gun captain was on job, was no harm in girls learning to handle lasers, morale was obviously high; I gave matter no more worry.Prof underrated his new Congress.Am sure he never wanted anything but a body which would rubberchop what we were doing and thereby do make it "voice of people. "But fact that new Congressmen were not yammerheads resulted in them doing more than Prof intended.Especially Committee on Permanent Organization, Resolutions, and Government Structure.Got out of hand because we were all trying to do too much.Permanent heads of Congress were Prof, Finn Nielsen.and Wyoh.Prof showed up only when he wanted to speak to them  seldom.He spent time with Mike on plans and analysis (odds shortened to one in five during September '76), time with Stu and Sheenie Sheehan on propaganda, controlling official news to Earthside, very different "news" that went via "clandestine" radio, and reslanting news that came up from Earthside.Besides that he had finger in everything; I reported whim once a day, and all ministries both real and dummy did same.I kept Finn Nielsen busy; he was my "Commander of Armed Forces. "He had his laser gun infantry to supervise  six men with captured weapons on day we nabbed warden, now eight hundred scattered all through Luna and armed with Kongville monkey copies.Besides that, Wyoh's organizations, Stilyagi Air Corps, Stilyagi Debs, Ladies from Hades, Irregulars (kept for morale and renamed Peter Pan's Pirates), and Lysistrata Corps  all these halfway military groups reported through Wyoh to Finn.I shoved it onto him; I had other problems, such as trying to be a computer mechanic as well as a "statesman" when jobs such as installing that computer at new catapult site had to be done.Besides which, I am not an executive and Finn had talent for it.I shoved First and Second Defense Gunners under him, too.But first I decided that these two skeleton regiments were a "brigade" and made Judge Brody a "brigadier. "Brody knew as much about military matters as I did  zero  but was widely known, highly respected, had unlimited hard sense  and had been drillman before he lost leg.Finn was not drillman, so couldn't be placed directly over them; They wouldn't have listened.I thought about using my co husband Greg.But Greg was needed at Mare Undarum catapult, was only mechanic who had followed every phase of construction.Wyoh helped Prof, helped Stu, had her own organizations, I made trips out to Mare Undarum  and had little time to preside over Congress; task fell on senior committee chairman, Wolf Korsakov...who was busier than any of us; LuNoHoCo was running everything Authority used to run and many new things as well.Wolf had a good committee; Prof should have kept closer eye on it.Wolf had caused his boss, Moshai Baum, to be elected vice chairman and had in all seriousness outlined for his committee problem of determining what permanent government should be.Then Wolf had turned back on it.Those busy laddies split up and did it  studied forms of government in Carnegie Library, held subcommittee meetings, three or four people at a time (few enough to worry Prof had he known)  and when Congress met early in September to ratify some appointments and elect more congressmen at large, instead of adjourning, Comrade Baum had gavel and they recessed  and met again and turned selves into committee of the whole and passed a resolution and next thing we knew entire Congress was a Constitutional Convention divided into working groups headed by those subcommittees.I think Prof was shocked.But he couldn't undo it, had all been proper under rules he himself had written.But he rolled with punch, went to Novylen (where Congress now met  more central) and spoke to them with usual good nature and simply cast doubts on what they were doing rather than telling them flatly they were wrong.After gracefully thanking them he started picking early drafts to pieces:  "Comrade Members, like fire and fusion, government is a dangerous servant and a terrible master.You now have freedom  if you can keep it.But do remember that you can lose this freedom more quickly to yourselves than to any other tyrant.Move slowly, be hesitant, puzzle out the consequences of every word.I would not be unhappy if this convention sat for ten years before reporting  but I would be frightened if you took less than a year."Distrust the obvious, suspect the traditional...for in the past mankind has not done well when saddling itself with governments.For example, I note in one draft report a proposal for setting up a commission to divide Luna into congressional districts and to reapportion them from time to time according to population."This is the traditional way; therefore it should be suspect, considered guilty until proved innocent.Perhaps you feel that this is the only way.May I suggest others?Surely where a man lives is the least important thing about him.Constituencies might be formed by dividing people by occupation...or by age...or even alphabetically.Or they might not be divided, every member elected at large   and do not object that this would make it impossible for any man not widely known throughout Luna to be elected; that might be the best possible thing for Luna."You might even consider installing the candidates who receive the least number of votes; unpopular men may be just the sort to save you from a new tyranny.Don't reject the idea merely because it seems preposterous  think about it!In past history popularly elected governments have been no better and sometimes far worse than overt tyrannies."But if representative government turns out to be your intention there still may be ways to achieve it better than the territorial district.For example you each represent about ten thousand human beings, perhaps seven thousand of voting age  and some of you were elected by slim majorities.Suppose instead of election a man were qualified for office by petition signed by four thousand citizens.He would then represent those four thousand affirmatively, with no disgruntled minority, for what would have been a minority in a territorial constituency would all be free to start other petitions or join in them.All would then be represented by men of their choice.Or a man with eight thousand supporters might have two votes in this body.Difficulties, objections, practical points to be worked out  many of them!But you could work them out...and thereby avoid the chronic sickness of representative government, the disgruntled minority which feels  correctly!that it has been disenfranchised."But, whatever you do, do not let the past be a straitjacket!"I note one proposal to make this Congress a two house body.Excellent  the more impediments to legislation the better.But, instead of following tradition, I suggest one house legislators, another whose single duty is to repeal laws.Let legislators pass laws only with a two thirds majority...while the repealers are able to cancel any law through a mere one third minority.Preposterous?Think about it.If a bill is so poor that it cannot command two thirds of your consents, is it not likely that it would make a poor law?And if a law is disliked by as many as one third is it not likely that you would be better off without it?"But in writing your constitution let me invite attention the wonderful virtues of the negative!Accentuate the negative!Let your document be studded with things the government is forever forbidden to do.No conscript armies...no interference however slight with freedom of press, or speech, or travel, or assembly, or of religion, or of instruction, or communication, or occupation...no involuntary taxation.Comrades, if you were to spend five years in a study of history while thinking of more and more things that your governinen should promise never to do and then let your constitution be nothing but those negatives, I would not fear the outcome."What I fear most are affirmative actions of sober and well intentioned men, granting to government powers to do something that appears to need doing.Please remember always that the Lunar Authority was created for the noblest of purposes by just such sober and well intentioned men, all popularly elected.And with that thought I leave you to your labors.Thank you. ""Gospodin President!Question of information!You said 'no involuntary taxation'   Then how do you expect us to pay for things?Tanstaafl!""Goodness me, sir, that's your problem.I can think several ways.Voluntary contributions just as churches support themselves...government sponsored lotteries to which no one need subscribe...or perhaps you Congressmen should dig down into your own pouches and pay for whatever is needed; that would be one way to keep government down in size to its indispensable functions whatever they may be.If indeed there are any.I would be satisfied to have the Golden Rule be the only law; I see no need for any other, nor for any method of enforcing it.But if you really believe that your neighbors must have laws for their own good, why shouldn't you pay for it?Comrades, I beg you  do not resort to compulsory taxation.There is so worse tyranny than to force a man to pay for what he does not want merely because you think it would be good for him. "Prof bowed and left, Stu and I followed him.Once in an otherwise empty capsule I tackled him."Prof, I liked much that you said...but about taxation aren't you talking one thing and doing another?Who do you think is going to pay for all this spending we're doing?"He was silent long moments, then said, "Manuel, my only ambition is to reach the day when I can stop pretending to be a chief executive. ""Is no answer!""You have put your finger on the dilemma of all government  and the reason I am an anarchist.The power to tax, once conceded, has no limits; it contains until it destroys.I was not joking when I told them to dig into their own pouches.It may not be possible to do away with government  sometimes I think that government is an inescapable disease of human beings.But it may be possible to keep it small and starved and inoffensive  and can you think of a better way than by requiring the governors themselves to pay the costs of their antisocial hobby?""Still doesn't say how to pay for what we are doing now. ""'How,' Manuel?You know how we are doing it.We're stealing it.I'm neither proud of it nor ashamed; it's the means we have.If they ever catch on, they may eliminate us  and that I am prepared to face.At least, in stealing, we have not created the villainous precedent of taxation. ""Prof.I hate to say this  "  "Then why say it?""Because, damn it, I'm in it as deeply as you are...and want to see that money paid back!Hate to say it but what you just said sounds like hypocrisy. "He chuckled."Dear Manuel!Has it taken you all these years to decide that I am a hypocrite?""Then you admit it?'"No.But if it makes you feel better to think that I am one, you are welcome to use me as your scapegoat.But I am not a hypocrite to myself because I was aware the day we declared the Revolution that we would need much money and would have to steal it.It did not trouble me because I considered it better than food riots six years hence, cannibalism in eight.I made my choice and have no regrets. "I shut up, silenced but not satisfied.Stu said, "Professor, I'm glad to hear that you are anxious to stop being President. ""So?You share our comrade's misgivings?""Only in part.Having been born to wealth, stealing doesn't fret me as much as it does him.No, but now that Congress has taken up the matter of a constitution I intend to find time to attend sessions.I plan to nominate you for King. "Prof looked shocked."Sir, if nominated, I shall repudiate it.If elected, I shall abdicate. ""Don't be in a hurry.It might be the only way to get the sort of constitution you want.And that I want, too, with about your own mild lack of enthusiasm.You could be proclaimed King and the people would take you; we Loonies aren't wedded to a republic.They'd love the idea  ritual and robes and a court and all that. ""No!""Ja da!When the time comes, you won't be able to refuse.Because we need a king and there isn't another candidate who would be accepted.Bernardo the First, King of Luna and Emperor of the Surrounding Spaces. ""Stuart, I must ask you to stop.I'm becoming quite ill. ""You'll get used to it.I'm a royalist because I'm a democrat.I shan't let your reluctance thwart the idea any more than you let stealing stop you. "I said, "Hold it, Stu.You say you're a royalist because you're a democrat?""Of course.A king is the people's only protection against tyranny....specially against the worst of all tyrants, themselves.Prof will be ideal for the job...because he does not want the job.His only shortcoming is that he is a bachelor with no heir.We'll fix that.I'm going to name you as his heir.Crown Prince.His Royal Highness Prince Manuel de la Paz, Duke of Luna City, Admiral General of the Armed Forces and Protector of the Weak. "I stared.Then buried face in hands."Oh, Bog!"Book Three."TANSTAAFL!"23   Monday 12 October 2076 about nineteen hundred I was headed home after a hard day of nonsense in our offices in Raffles.Delegation of grain farmers wanted to see Prof and I had been called back because he was in Hong Kong Luna.Was rude to them.Had been two months of embargo and F. N.  had never done us favor of being sufficiently nasty.Mostly they had ignored us, made no reply to our claims  I suppose to do so would have been to recognize us.Stu and Sheenie and Prof had been hard put to slant news from Earthside to keep up a warlike spirit.At first everybody kept his p suit handy.They wore them, helmets under arms, going to and from work in corridors.But that slacked off as days went by and did not seem to be any danger  p suit is nuisance when you don't need it, so bulky.Presently taprooms began to display signs: NO P SUITS INSIDE.If a Loonie can't stop for half a liter on way home because of p suit, he'll leave it home or at station or wherever he needs it most.My word, had neglected matter myself that day  got this call to go back to office and was halfway there before I remembered.Had Just reached easement lock thirteen when I heard and felt a sound that scares a Loonie more than anything else  a chuff!in distance followed by a draft.Was into lock almost without undogging, then balanced pressures and through, dogged it behind me and ran for our home lock  through it and shouting:  "P suits, everybody!Get boys in from tunnels and close all airtight doors!"Mum and Milla were only adults in sight.Both looked startled, got busy without a word.I burst into workshop, grabbed p suit."Mike!Answer!""I'm here, Man," he said calmly."Heard explosive pressure drop.What's situation?""That's level three, L City.Rupture at Tube Station West, now partly controlled.Six ships landed, L City under attack  "  "What?""Let me finish, Man.Six transports landed, L City under attack by troops, Hong Kong inferred to be, phone lines broken at relay Bee Ell.Johnson City under attack; I have closed the armor doors between J City and Complex Under.I cannot see Novylen but blip projection indicates it is under attack.Same for Churchill, Tycho Under.One ship in high ellipsoid over me, rising, inferred to be command ship.No other blips. ""Six ships  where in hell were YOU?"He answered so calmly that I steadied down."Farside approach, Man; I'm blind back there.They came in on tight Garrison didoes, skimming the peaks; I barely saw the chop off for Luna City.The ship at J City is the only one I can see; the other landings I conclusively infer from the ballistics shown by blip tracks.I heard the break in at Tube West, L City, and can now hear fighting in Novylen.The rest is conclusive inference, probability above point nine nine.I called you and Professor at once. "Caught breath."Operation Hard Rock, Prepare to Execute. ""Program ready.Man, not being able to reach you, I used your voice.Play back?""Nyet   Yes!Da!"Heard "myself" tell watch officer at old catapult head to go on red alert for "Hard Rock"  flrst load at launch, all others, on belts, everything cast loose, but do not launch until ordered by me personally  then launch to plan, full automatic."I" made him repeat back."Okay," I told Mike."Drill gun crews?""Your voice again.Manned, and then sent back to ready rooms.That command ship won't reach aposelenion for three hours four point seven minutes.No target for more than five hours. ""He may maneuver.Or launch missiles. ""Slow down, Man.Even a missile I'll see with minutes to spare.It's full bright lunar up there now  how much do you want the men to take?Unnecessarily. ""Uh...sorry.Better let me talk to Greg. ""Play back  " Heard "my" voice talking to my co husband at Mare Undarum; "I" sounded tense but calm.Mike had given him situation, had told him to prepare Operation Little David's Sling, keep it on standby for full automatic."I" had assured him that master computer would keep standby computer programmed, and shift would be made automatically if communication was broken."I" also told him that he must take command and use own judgment if communication was lost and not restored after four hours  listen to Earthside radio and make up own mind.Greg had taken it quietly, repeated his orders, then had said, "Mannie, tell family I love them. "Mike had done me proud; he had answered for me with just right embarrassed choke."I'll do that, Greg  and look, Greg.I love you, too.You know that, don't you?""I know it, Mannie...and I'm going to say a special prayer for you. ""Thanks, Greg. ""'Bye, Mannie.Go do what you must. "So I went and did what I had to do; Mike had played my role as well or better than I could.Finn, when he could be reached, would be handled by "Adam. "So I left, fast, calling out Greg's message of love to Mum.She was p suited and had roused Grandpaw and suited him in  first time in years.So out I went, helmet closed and laser gun in hand.And reached lock thirteen and found it blind dogged from other side with nobody in sight through bull's eye.All correct, per drill  except stilyagi in charge of that lock should have been in sight.Did no good to pound.Finally went back way I had come  and on through our home, through our vegetable tunnels and on up to our private surface lock leading to our solar battery.And found a shadow on its bull's eye when should have been scalding sunlight  damned Terran ship had landed on Davis surface!Its jacks formed a giant tripod over me, was staring up its jets.Backed clown fast and out of there, blind dogging both hatches, then blind dogged every pressure door on way back.Told Mum, then told her to put one of boys on back door with a laser gun  here, take this one.No boys, no men, no able bodied women  Mum, Gramp, and our small children were all that were left; rest had gone looking for trouble.Mimi wouldn't take laser gun."I don't know how to use it, Manuel, and it's too late to learn; you keep it.But they won't get in through Davis Tunnels.I know some tricks you never heard of. "Didn't stop to argue; arguing with Mimi is waste of time  and she might know tricks I didn't know; she had stayed alive in Luna a long time, under worse conditions than I had ever known.This time lock thirteen was manned; two boys on duty let me through.I demanded news."Pressure's all right now," older one told me."This level, at least.Fighting down toward Causeway.Say, General Davis, can't I go with you?One's enough at this lock. ""Nyet. ""Want to get me an earthworm!""This is your post, stay on it.If an earthworm comes this way, he's yours.Don't you be his. "Left at a trot.So as a result of own carelessness, not keeping p suit with me, all I saw of Battle in Corridors was tail end  hell of a "defense minister. "Charged north in Ring corridor, with helmet open; reached access lock for long ramp to Causeway.Lock was open; cursed and stopped to dog it as I went through, warily  saw why it was open; boy who had been guarding it was dead.So moved most cautiously down ramp and out onto Causeway.Was empty at this end but could see figures and hear noise in city, where it opens out.Two figures in p suits and carrying guns detached selves and headed my way.Burned both.One p suited man with gun looks like another; I suppose they took me for one of their flankers.And to me they looked no different from Finn's men, at that distance  save that I never thought about it.A new chum doesn't move way a cobher does; he moves feet too high and always scrambling for traction.Not that I stopped to analyze, not even: "Earthworms!Kill!"Saw them, burned them.They were sliding softly along floor before realized what I'd done.Stopped, intending to grab their guns.But were chained to them and could not figure out how to get loose  key needed, perhaps.Besides, were not lasers but something I had never seen: real guns.Fired small explosive missiles I learned later  just then all I knew was no idea how to use.Had spearing knives on ends, too, sort called "bayonets," which was reason I tried to get them loose.Own gun was good for only ten full power burns and no spare power pack; those spearing bayonets looked useful  one had blood on it, Loonie blood I assume.But gave up in seconds only, used belt knife to make dead sure they stayed dead, and hurried toward fight, thumb on switch.Was a mob, not a battle.Or maybe a battle is always that way, confusion and noise and nobody really knowing what's going on.In widest part of Causeway, opposite Bon Marche where Grand Ramp slopes northward down from level three, were several hundred Loonies, men and women, and children who should have been at home.Less than half were in p suits and only a few seemed to have weapons  and pouring down ramp were soldiers, all armed.But first thing I noticed was noise, din that filled my open helmet and beat on ears  a growl.Don't know what else to call it; was compounded of every anger human throat can make, from squeals of small children to bull roars of grown men.Sounded like biggest dog fight in history  and suddenly realized I was adding my share, shouting obscenities and wordless yells.Girl no bigger than Hazel vaulted up onto rail of ramp, went dancing up it centimeters from shoulders of troopers pouring down.She was armed with what appeared to be a kitchen cleaver; saw her swing it, saw it connect.Couldn't have hurt him much through his p suit but he went down and more stumbled over him.Then one of them connected with her, spearing a bayonet into her thigh and over backwards she went, falling out of sight.Couldn't really see what was going on, nor can remember   just flashes, like girl going over backwards.Don't know who she was, don't know if she survived.Couldn't draw a bead from where I was, too many heads in way.But was an open counter display, front of a toy shop on my left; I bounced up onto it.Put me a meter higher than Causeway pavement with clear view of earthworms pouring down.Braced self against wall, took careful aim, trying for left chest.Some uncountable time later found that my laser was no longer working, so stopped.Guess eight troopers did not go home because of me but hadn't counted  and time really did seem endless.Although everybody moving fast as possible, looked and felt like instruction movie where everything is slowed to frozen motion.At least once while using up my power pack some earthworm spotted me and shot back; was explosion just over my head and bits of shop's wall hit helmet.Perhaps that happened twice.Once out of juice I jumped down from toy counter, clubbed laser and joined mob surging against foot of ramp.All this endless time (five minutes?)earthworms had been shooting into crowd; you could hear sharp splat!and sometimes plop!those little missiles made as they exploded inside flesh or louder pounk!if they hit a wall or something solid.Was still trying to reach foot of ramp when I realized they were no longer shooting.Were down, were dead, every one of them  were no longer coming down ramp.24   All through Luna invaders were dead, if not that instant, then shortly.Over two thousand troopers dead, more than three times that number of Loonies died in stopping them, plus perhaps as many Loonies wounded, a number never counted.No prisoners taken in any warren, although we got a dozen officers and crew from each ship when we mopped up.A major reason why Loonies, mostly unarmed,, were able to kill armed and trained soldiers lay in fact that a freshly landed earthworm can't handle himself well.Our gravity, one sixth what he is used to, makes all his lifelong reflexes his enemy.He shoots high without knowing it, is unsteady on feet, can't run properly   feet slide out from under him.Still worse, those troopers had to fight downwards; they necessarily broke in at upper levels, then had to go down ramps again and again, to try to capture a city.And earthworms don't know how to go down ramps.Motion isn't running, isn't walking, isn't flying  is more a controlled dance, with feet barely touching and simply guiding balance.A Loonie three year old does it without thinking, comes skipping down in a guided fall, toes touching every few meters.But an earthworm new chums it, finds self "walking on air"  he struggles, rotates, loses control, winds up at bottom, unhurt but angry.But these troopers wound up dead; was on ramps we got them.Those I saw had mastered trick somewhat, had come down three ramps alive.Nevertheless only a few snipers at top of ramp landing could fire effectively; those on ramp had all they could do to stay upright, hang on to weapons, try to reach level below.Loonies did not let them.Men and women (and many children) surged up at them, downed them, killed them with everything from bare hands to their own bayonets.Nor was I only laser gun around; two of Finn's men swarmed up on balcony of Bon Marche and, crouching there, picked off snipers at top of ramp.Nobody told them to, nobody led them, nobody gave orders; Finn never had chance to control his half trained disorderly militia.Fight started, they fought.And that was biggest reason why we Loonies won: We fought.Most Loonies never laid eyes on a live invader but wherever troopers broke in, Loonies rushed in like white corpuscles  and fought.Nobody told them.Our feeble organization broke down under surprise.But we Loonies fought berserk and invaders died.No trooper got farther down than level six in any warren.They say that people in Bottom Alley never knew we were invaded until over.But invaders fought well, too.These troops were not only crack riot troops, best peace enforcers for city work F. N.  had; they also had been indoctrinated and drugged.Indoctrination had told them (correctly) that their only hope of going Earthside again was to capture warrens and pacify them.If they did, they were promised relief and no more duty in Luna.But was win or die, for was pointed out that their transports could not take off if they did not win, as they had to be replenished with reaction mass  impossible without first capturing Luna.(And this was true. )Then they were loaded with energizers, don't worries, and fear inhibitors that would make mouse spit at cat, and turned loose.They fought professionally and quite fearlessly  died.In Tycho Under and in Churchill they used gas and casualties were more one sided; only those Loonies who managed to reach p suits were effective.Outcome was same, simply took longer.Was knockout gas as Authority had no intention of killing us all; simply wanted to teach us a lesson, get us under control, put us to work.Reason for F. N.'s long delay and apparent indecision arose from method of sneak attack.Decision had been made shortly after we embargoed grain (so we learned from captured transport officers); time was used in mounting attack  much of it in a long elliptical orbit which went far outside Luna's orbit, crossing ahead of Luna, then looping back and making rendezvous above Farside.Of course Mike never saw them; he's blind back there.He had been skywatching with his ballistic radars  but no radar can look over horizon; longest look Mike got at any ship in orbit was eight minutes.They came skimming peaks in tight, circular orbits, each straight for target with a fast dido landing at end, sitting them down with high gee, precisely at new earth, 12 Oct 76 Gr.18h 40m 36.9s  if not at that exact tenth of a second, then as close to it as Mike could tell from blip tracks  elegant work, one must admit, on part of F. N.  Peace Navy.Big brute that poured a thousand troops into L City Mike did not see until it chopped off for grounding  a glimpse.He would have been able to see it a few seconds sooner had he been looking eastward with new radar at Mare Undarum site, but happened he was drilling "his idiot son" at time and they were looking through it westward at Terra.Not that those seconds would have mattered.Surprise was so beautifully planned, so complete, that each landing force was crashing in at Greenwich 1900 all over Luna, before anybody suspected.No accident that it was just new earth with all warrens in bright semi lunar; Authority did not really know Lunar conditions  but did know that no Loonie goes up onto surface unnecessarily during bright semi lunar, and if he must, then does whatever he must do quickly as possible and gets back down inside  and checks his radiation counter.So they caught us with our p suits down.And our weapons.But with troopers dead we still had six transports on our surface and a command ship in our sky.Once Bon Marche engagement was over, I got hold of self and found a phone.No word from Kongville, no word from Prof.J Clty fight had been won, same for Novylen  transport there had toppled on landing; invading force had been understrength from landing losses and Finn's boys now held disabled transport.Still fighting in Churchill and Tycho Under.Nothing going on in other warrens.Mike had shut down tubes and was reserving interwarren phone links for official calls.An explosive pressure drop in Churchill Upper, uncontrolled.Yes, Finn had checked in and could be reached.So I talked to Finn, told him where L City transport was, arranged to meet at easement lock thirteen.Finn had much same experience as I  caught cold save he did have p suit.Had not been able to establish control over laser gunners until fight was over and himself had fought solo in massacre in Old Dome.Now was beginning to round up his lads and had one officer taking reports from Finn's office in Bon Marche.Had reached Novylen subcommander but was worried about HKL  "Mannie, should I move men there by tube?"Told him to wait  they couldn't get at us by tube, not while we controlled power, and doubted if that transport could lift."Let's look at this one. "So we went out through lock thirteen, clear to end of private pressure, on through farm tunnels of a neighbor (who could not believe we had been invaded) and used his surface lock to eyeball transport from a point nearly a kilometer west of it.We were cautious in lifting hatch lid.Then pushed it up and climbed out; outcropping of rock shielded us.We Red Indianed around edge and looked, using helmet binox.Then withdrew behind rock and talked.Finn said, "Think my lads can handle this. ""How?""If I tell you, you'll think of reasons why it won't work.So how about letting me run my own show, cobber?"Have heard of armies where boss is not told to shut up   word is "discipline. "But we were amateurs.Finn allowed me to tag along  unarmed.Took him an hour to put it together, two minutes to execute.He scattered a dozen men around ship, using farmers' surface radio silence throughout  anyhow, some did not have p suit radios, city boys.Finn took position farthest west; when he was sure others had had time, he sent up a signal rocket.When flare burst over ship, everybody burned at once, each working on a predesignated antenna.Finn used up his power pack, replaced it and started burning into hull  not door lock, hull.At once his cherry red spot was joined by another, then three more, all working on same bit of steel  and suddenly molten steel splattered out and you could see air bosh!out of ship, a shimmery plume of refraction.They kept working on it, making a nice big hole, until they ran out of power.I could imagine hooraw inside ship, alarms clanging, emergency doors closing, crew trying to seal three impossibly big holes at once, for rest of Finn's squad, scattered around ship, were giving treatment to two other spots in hull.They didn't try to burn anything else.Was a non atmosphere ship, built in orbit, with pressure hull separate from power plant and tanks; they gave treatment where would do most good.Finn pressed helmet to mine."Can't lift now.And can't talk.Doubt they can make hull tight enough to live without p suits.What say we let her sit a few days and see if they come out?If they don't, then can move a heavy drill up here and give 'em real dose of fun. "Decided Finn knew how to run his show without my sloppy help, so went back inside, called Mike, and asked for capsule go out to ballistic radars.He wanted to know why I didn't stay inside where it was safe.I said, "Listen, you upstart collection of semi conductors, you are merely a minister without portfolio while I am Minister of Defense.I ought to see what's going on and I have exactly two eyeballs while you've got eyes spread over half of Crisium.You trying to hog fun?"He told me not to jump salty and offered to put his displays on a video screen, say in room L of Raffles  did not want me to get hurt...and had I heard joke about drillman who hurt his mother's feelings?I said, "Mike, please let me have a capsule.Can p suit and meet it outside Station West  which is in bad shape as I'm sure you know. ""Okay," he said, "it's your neck.Thirteen minutes.I'll let you go as far as Gun Station George. "Mighty kind of him.Got there and got on phone again.Finn had called other warrens, located his subordinate commanders or somebody willing to take charge, and had explained how to make trouble for grounded transports  all but Hong Kong; for all we knew Authority's goons held Hong Kong."Adam," I said, others being in earshot, "do you think we might send a crew out by rolligon and try to repair link Bee Ell?""This is not Gospodin Selene," Mike answered in a strange voice, "this is one of his assistants.Adam Selene was in Churchill Upper when it lost pressure.I'm afraid that we must assume that he is dead. ""What?""I am very sorry, Gospodin. ""Hold phone!"Chased a couple of drillmen and a girl out of room, then sat down and lowered hush hood."Mike," I said softly, "private now.What is this gum beating?""Man," he said quietly, "think it over.Adam Selene had to go someday.He's served his purpose and is, as you pointed out, almost out of the government.Professor and I have discussed this; the only question has been the timing.Can you think of a better last use for Adam than to have him die in this invasion?It makes him a national hero...and the nation needs one.Let it stand that 'Adam Selene is probably dead' until you can talk to Professor.If he still needs 'Adam Selene' it can turn out that he was trapped in a private pressure and had to wait to be rescued. ""Well   Okay, let it stay open.Personally, I always preferred your 'Mike' personality anyhow. ""I know you do, Man my first and best friend, and so do I.  It's my real one; 'Adam' was a phony. ""Uh, yes.But, Mike, if Prof is dead in Kongville, I'm going to need help from 'Adam' awful bad. ""So we've got him iced and can bring him back if we need him.The stuffed shirt.Man, when this is over, are you going to have time to take up with me that research into humor again?""I'll take time, Mike; that's a promise. ""Thanks, Man.These days you and Wyoh never have time to visit...and Professor wants to talk about things that aren't much fun.I'll be glad when this war is over. ""Are we going to win, Mike?"He chuckled."It's been days since you asked me that.Here's a pinky new projection, run since invasion started.Hold on tight, Man  our chances are now even!""Good Bog!""So button up and go see the fun.But stay back at least a hundred meters from the gun; that ship may be able to follow back a laser beam with another one.Ranging shortly.Twenty one minutes. "Didn't get that far away, as needed to stay on phone and longest cord around was less.I jacked parallel into gun captain's phone, found a shady rock and sat down.Sun was high in west, so close to Terra that I could see Terra only by visoring against Sun's glare  no crescent yet, new earth ghostly gray in moonlight surrounded by a thin radiance of atmosphere.I pulled my helmet back into shade."Ballistic control, O'Kelly Davis now at Drill Gun George.Near it, I mean, about a hundred meters," Figured Mike would not be able to tell how long a cord I was using, out of kilometers of wires."Ballistic control aye aye," Mike answered without argument."I will so inform HQ. ""Thank you, ballistic control.Ask HQ if they have heard from Congressman Wyoming Davis today. "Was fretted about Wyoh and whole family."I will inquire. "Mike waited a reasonable time, then said, "HQ says that Gospazha Wyoming Davis has taken charge of first aid work in Old Dome. ""Thank you. "Chest suddenly felt better.Don't love Wyoh more than others but  well, she was new.And Luna needed her."Ranging," Mike said briskly."All guns, elevation eight seven zero, azimuth one nine three zero, set parallax for thirteen hundred kilometers closing to surface.Report when eyeballed. "I stretched out, pulling knees up to stay in shade, and searched part of sky indicated, almost zenith and a touch south.With sunlight not on my helmet I could see stars, but inner pert of binox were hard to position  had to twist around and raise up on right elbow.Nothing   Hold it, was star with disc...where no planet ought to be.Noted another star close, watched and waited.Uh huh!Da!Growing brighter and creeping north very slowly   Hey, that brute is going to land right on us!But thirteen hundred kilometers is a long way, even when closing to terminal velocity.Reminded self that it couldn't fall on us from a departure ellipse looping back, would have to fall around Luna  unless ship had maneuvered into new trajectory.Which Mike hadn't mentioned.Wanted to ask, decided not to  wanted him to put all his savvy into analyzing that ship, not distract him with questions.All guns reported eyeball tracking, including four Mike was laying himself, via selsyns.Those four reported tracking dead on by eyeball without touching manual controls  good news; meant that Mike had that baby taped, had solved trajectory perfectly.Shortly was clear that ship was not falling around Luna, was coming in for landing.Didn't need to ask; it was getting much brighter and position against stars was not changing  damn, it was going to land on us!"Five hundred kilometers closing," Mike said quietly."Stand by to burn.All guns on remote control, override manually at command 'burn. 'Eighty seconds. "Longest minute and twenty seconds I've ever met  that brute was big!Mike called every ten seconds down to thirty, then started chanting seconds.  "five  four  three  two  one  BURN!"and ship suddenly got much brighter.Almost missed little speck that detached itself just before  or just at  burn.But Mike said suddenly, "Missile launched.Selsyn guns track with me, do not override.Other guns stay on ship.Be ready for new coordinates. "A few seconds or hours later he gave new coordinates and added, "Eyeball and burn at will. "I tried to watch ship and missile both, lost both  jerked eyes away from binoculars, suddenly saw missile  then saw it impact, between us and catapult head.Closer to us, less than a kilometer.No, it did not go off, not an H fusion reaction, or I wouldn't be telling this.But made a big, bright explosion of its own, remaining fuel I guess, silver bright even in sunlight, and shortly I felt heard ground wave.But nothing was hurt but a few cubic meters of rock.Ship was still coming down.No longer burned bright; could see it as a ship now and didn't seem hurt.Expected any instant that tail of fire to shoot out, stop it into a dido landing.Did not.Impacted ten kilometers north of us and made a fancy silvery halfdome before it gave up and quit being anything but spots before eyes.Mike said, "Report casualties, secure all guns.Go below when secured. ""Gun Alice, no casualties"  "Gun Bambie no casualties"  "Gun Caesar, one man hit by rock splinter, pressure contained"   Went below, to that proper phone, called Mike."What happened, Mike?Wouldn't they give you control after you burned their eyes out?""They gave me control, Man. ""Too late?""I crashed it, Man.It seemed the prudent course. "An hour later was down with Mike, first time in four or five months.Could reach Complex Under more quickly than L City and was in as close touch there with anybody as would be in city  with no interruptions.Needed to talk to Mike.I had tried to phone Wyoh from catapult head tube station; reached somebody at Old Dome temporary hospital and learned that Wyoh had collapsed and been bedded down herself, with enough sleepy time to keep her out for night.Finn had gone to Churchill with a capsule of his lads, to lead attack on transport there.Stu I hadn't heard from.Hong Kong and Prof were still cut off.At moment Mike and I seemed to be total government.And time to start Operation Hard Rock.But Hard Rock was not just throwing rocks; was also telling Terra what we were going to do and why  and our just cause for doing so.Prof and Stu and Sheenie and Adam had all worked on it, a dummy up based on an assumed attack.Now attack had come, and propaganda had to be varied to fit.Mike had already rewritten it and put it through print out so I could study it.I looked up from a long roll of paper."Mike, these news stories and our message to F. N.  all assume that we have won in Hong Kong.How sure are you?""Probability in excess of eighty two percent. ""Is that good enough to send these out?""Man, the probability that we will win there, if we haven't already, approaches certainty.That transport can't move; the others were dry, or nearly.There isn't that much monatomic hydrogen in HKL; they would have to come here.Which means moving troops overland by rolligon  a rough trip with the Sun up even for Loonies  then defeat us when they get here.They can't.This assumes that that transport and its troops are no better armed than the others. ""How about that repair crew to Bee Ell?""I say not to wait.Man, I've used your voice freely and made all preparations.Horror pictures, Old Dome and elsewhere, especially Churchill Upper, for video.Stories to match.We should channel news Earthside at once, and announce execution of Hard Rock at same time. "I took a deep breath."Execute Operation Hard Rock. ""Want to give the order yourself?Say it aloud and I'll match it, voice and choice of words. ""Go ahead, say it your way.Use my voice and my authority as Minister of Defense and acting head of government.Do it, Mike, throw rocks at 'em!Damn it, big rocks!Hit 'em hard!""Righto, Man!"25   "A maximum of instructive shrecklichkeit with minimum loss of life.None, if possible"  was how Prof summed up doctrine for Operation Hard Rock and was way Mike and I carried it out.Idea was to hit earthworms so hard would convince them  while hitting so gently as not to hurt.Sounds impossible, but wait.Would necessarily be a delay while rocks fell from Luna to Terra; could be as little as around ten hours to as long as we dared to make it.Departure speed from a catapult is highly critical and a variation on order of one percent could double or halve trajectory time, Luna to Terra.This Mike could do with extreme accuracy  was equally at home with a slow ball, many sorts of curves, or burn it right over plate  and I wish he had pitched for Yankees.But no matter how he threw them, final velocity at Terra would be close to Terra's escape speed, near enough eleven kilometers per second as to make no difference.That terrible speed results from gravity well shaped by Terra's mass, eighty times that of Luna, and made no real difference whether Mike pushed a missile gently over well curb or flipped it briskly.Was not muscle that counted but great depth of that well.So Mike could program rock throwing to suit time needed for propaganda.He and Prof had settled on three days plus not more than one apparent rotation of Terra  24hrs 50min 28.32sec  to allow our first target to reach initial point of program.You see, while Mike was capable of hooking a missile around Terra and hitting a target on its far side, he could be much more accurate if he could see his target, follow it down by radar during last minutes and nudge it a little for pinpoint accuracy.We needed this extreme accuracy to achieve maximum frightfulness with minimum to zero killing.Call our shots, tell them exactly where they would be hit and at what second  and give them three days to get off that spot.So our first message to Terra, at 0200 13 Oct 76 seven hours after they invaded, not only announced destruction of their task force, and denounced invasion for brutality, but also promised retaliation bombing, named times and places, and gave each nation a deadline by which to denounce F. N.'s action, recognize us, and thereby avoid being bombed.Each deadline was twenty four hours before local "strike".Was more time than Mike needed.That long before impact a rock for a target would be in space a long way out, its guidance thrustors still unused and plenty of elbow room.With considerably less than a full day's warning Mike could miss Terra entirely  kick that rock sideways and make it fall around Terra in a permanent orbit.But with even an hour's warning he could usually abort into an ocean.First target was North American Directorate.All great Peace Force nations, seven veto powers, would be hit: N. A.  Directorate, Great China, India, Sovunion, PanAfrica (Chad exempted), Mitteleuropa, Brasilian Union.Minor nations were assigned targets and times, too  but were told that not more than 20 percent of these targets would be hit  partly shortage of steel but also frightfulness: if Belgium was hit first time around, Holland might decide to protect her polders by dealing out before Luna was again high in her sky.But every target was picked to avoid if possible killing anybody.For Mitteleuropa this was difficult; our targets had to be water or high mountains  Adriatic, North Sea, Baltic, so forth.But on most of Terra is open space despite eleven billion busy breeders.North America had struck me as horribly crowded, but her billion people are clumped  is still wasteland, mountain and desert.We laid down a grid on North America to show how precisely we could hit  Mike felt that fifty meters would be a large error.We had examined maps and Mike had checked by radar all even intersections, say 105 W by 50 N  if no town there, might wind up on target grid...especially if a town was close enough to provide spectators to be shocked and frightened.We warned that our bombs would be as destructive as H  bombs but emphasized that there would be no radioactive fallout, no killing radiation  just a terrible explosion, shock wave in air, ground wave of concussion.We warned that these might knock down buildings far outside of explosion and then left it to their judgments how far to run.If they clogged their roads, fleeing from panic rather than real danger  well, that was fine, just fine!But we emphasized that nobody would get hurt who heeded our warnings, that every target first time around would be uninhabited  we even offered to skip any target if a nation would inform us that our data were out of date.(Empty offer; Mike's radar vision was a cosmic 20/20. )But by not saying what would happen second time around, we hinted that our patience could be exhausted.In North America, grid was parallels 35, 40, 45, 50 degrees north crossed by meridians 110, 115, 120 west, twelve targets.For each we added a folksy message to natives, such as:  "Target 115 west by 35 north  impact will be displaced forty five kilometers northwest to exact top of New York Peak.Citizens of Goffs, Cima, Kelso, and Nipton please note."Target 100 west by 40 north is north 30 west of Norton, Kansas, at twenty kilometers or thirteen English miles.Residents of Norton, Kansas, and of Beaver City and Wilsonville, Nebraska, are cautioned.Stay away from glass windows.It is best to wait indoors at least thirty minutes after impact because of possibility of long, high splashes of rock.Flash should not be looked at with bare eyes.Impact will be exactly 0300 your local zone time Friday 16 October, or 0900 Greenwich time  good luck!"Target 110 W by 50 N  impact will be offset ten kilometers north.People of Walsh, Saskatchewan, please note. "Besides this grid, a target was selected in Alaska (150 W x 60 N) and two in Mexico (110W x 30 N, 105 W x 25 N) so that they would not feel left out, and several targets in the crowded east, mostly water, such as Lake Michigan halfway between Chicago and Grand Rapids, and Lake Okeechobee in Florida.Where we used bodies of water Mike worked predictions of flooding waves from impacts, a time for each shoreline establishment.For three days, starting early morning Tuesday 13th and going on to strike time early Friday 16th, we flooded Earth with warnings.England was cautioned that impact north of Dover Straits opposite London Estuary would cause disturbances far up Thames; Sovunion was given warning for Sea of Azov and had own grid defined; Great China was assigned grid in Siberia, Gobi Desert, and her far west  with offsets to avoid her historic Great Wall noted in loving detail.Pan Africa was awarded shots into Lake Victoria, still desert part of Sahara, one on Drakensberg in south, one offset twenty kilometers due west of Great Pyramid  and urged to follow Chad not later than midnight Thursday, Greenwich.India was told to watch certain mountain peaks and outside Bombay harbor  time, same as Great China.And so forth.Attempts were made to jam our messages but we were beaming straight down on several wavelengths  hard to stop.Warnings were mixed with propaganda, white and black   news of failed invasion, horror pictures of dead, names and I. D.  numbers of invaders  addressed to Red Cross and Crescent but in fact a grim boast showing that every trooper had been killed and that all ships' officers and crew had been killed or captured  we "regretted" being unable to identify dead of flagship, as it had been shot down with destruction so complete as to make it impossible.But our attitude was conciliatory  "Look, people of Terra, we don't want to kill you.In this necessary retaliation we are making every effort to avoid killing you...but if you can't or won't get your governments to leave us in peace, then we shall be forced to kill you.We're up here, you're down there; you can't stop us.So please be sensible!"We explained over and over how easy it was for us to hit them, how hard for them to reach us.Nor was this exaggeration.It's barely possible to launch missiles from Terra to Luna; it's easier to launch from Earth parking orbit  but very expensive.Their practical way to bomb us was from ships.This we noted and asked them how many multimilliondollar ships they cared to use up trying it?What was it worth to try to spank us for something we had not done?It had cost them seven of their biggest and best already  did they want to try for fourteen?If so, our secret weapon that we used on FNS Pax was waiting.Last above was a calculated boast  Mike figured less than one chance in a thousand that Pax had been able to get off a message reporting what had happened to her and it was still less likely that proud F. N.  would guess that convict miners could convert their tools into space weapons.Nor did F. N.  have many ships to risk.Were about two hundred space vehicles in commission, not counting satellites.But nine tenths of these were Terra to orbit ships such as Lark  and she had been able to make a Luna jump only by stripping down and arriving dry.Spaceships aren't built for no purpose  too expensive.F. N.  had six cruisers that could probably bomb us without landing on Luna to refill tanks simply by swapping payload for extra tanks.Had several more which might be modified much as Lark had been, plus a few convict and cargo ships which could get into orbit around Luna but could never go home without refilling tanks.Was no possible doubt that F. N.  could defeat us; question was how high a price they would pay.So we had to convince them that price was too high before they had time to bring enough force to bear.A poker game   We intended to raise so steeply that they would fold and drop out.We hoped.And then never have to show our busted flush.Communication with Hong Kong Luna was restored at end of first day of radio video phase, during which time Mike was "throwing rocks," getting first barrage lined up.Prof called  and was I happy to hear!Mike briefed him, then I waited, expecting one of his mild reprimands  bracing self to answer sharply: "And what was I supposed to do?With you out of touch and possibly dead?Me left alone as acting head of government and crisis on top of us?Throw it away, just because you couldn't be reached?"Never got to say it.Prof said, "You did exactly right, Manuel.You were acting head of government and the crisis was on top of you.I'm delighted that you did not throw away the golden moment merely because I was out of touch. "What can you do with a bloke like that?Me with heat up to red mark and no chance to use it  had to swallow and say, "Spasebaw, Prof. "Prof confirmed death of "Adam Selene. ""We could have used the fiction a little longer but this is the perfect opportunity.Mike, you and Manuel have matters in hand; I had better stop off at Churchill on my way home and identify his body. "So he did.Whether Prof picked a Loonie body or a trooper I never asked, nor how he silenced anybody else involved  perhaps no huhu as many bodies in Churchill Upper were never identified.This one was right size and skin color; it had been explosively decompressed and burned in face  looked awful!It lay in state in Old Dome with face covered, and was speech making I didn't listen to  Mike didn't miss a word; his most human quality was his conceit.Some rockhead wanted to embalm this dead flesh, giving Lenin as a precedent.But Pravda pointed out that Adam was a staunch conservationist and would never want this barbaric exception made.So this unknown soldier, or citizen, or citizen soldier, wound up in our city's cloaca.Which forces me to tell something I've put off.Wyoh was not hurt, merely exhaustion.But Ludmilla never came back.I did not know it  glad I didn't  but she was one of many dead at foot of ramp facing Ben Marche.An explosive bullet hit between her lovely, little girl breasts.Kitchen knife in her hand had blood on it  !think she had had time to pay Ferryman's Fee.Stu came out to Complex to tell me rather than phoning, then went back with me.Stu had not been missing; once fight was over he had gone to Raffles to work with his special codebook  but that can wait.Mum reached him there and he offered to break it to me.So then I had to go home for our crying together  though it is well that nobody reached me until after Mike and I started Hard Rock.When we got home, Stu did not want to come in, not being sure of our ways.Anna came out and almost dragged him in.He was welcome and wanted; many neighbors came to cry.Not as many as with most deaths  but we were just one of many families crying together that day.Did not stay long  couldn't; had work to do.I saw Milla just long enough to kiss her good bye.She was lying in her room and did look as if she did be simply sleeping.Then I stayed a while with my beloveds before going back to pick up load.Had never realized, until that day, how old Mimi is.Sure, she had seen many deaths, some her own descendants.But little Milla's death did seem almost too much for her.Ludmilla was special  Mimi's granddaughter, daughter in all but fact, and by most special exception and through Mimi's intervention her co wife, most junior to most senior.Like all Loonies, we conserve our dead  and am truly glad that barbaric custom of burial was left back on old Earth; our way is better.But Davis family does not put that which comes out of processor into our commercial farming tunnels.No.It goes into our little greenhouse tunnel, there to become roses and daffodils and peonies among soft singing bees.Tradition says that Black Jack Davis is in there, or whatever atoms of him do remain after many, many, many years of blooming.Is a happy place, a beautiful place.Came Friday with no answer from F. N.  News up from Earthside seemed equal parts unwillingness to believe we had destroyed seven ships and two regiments (F. N.  had not even confirmed that a battle had taken place) and complete disbelief that we could bomb Terra, or could matter if we did  they still called it "throwing rice. "More time was given to World Series.Stu worried because had received no answers to code messages.They had gone via LuNoHoCo's commercial traffic to their Zurich agent, thence to Stu's Paris broker, from him by less usual channels to Dr.Chan, with whom I had once had a talk and with whom Sm had talked later, arranging a communication channel.Stu had pointed out to Dr.Chan that, since Great China was not to be bombed until twelve hours after North America, bombing of Great China could be aborted after bombing of North America was a proved fact  if Great China acted swiftly.Alternatively, Stu had invited Dr.Chan to suggest variations in target if our choices in Great China were not as deserted as we believed them to be.Stu fretted  had placed great hopes in quasi cooperation he had established with Dr.Chan.Me, I had never been sure  only thing I was sure of was that Dr.Chan would not himself sit on a target.But he might not warn his old mother.My worries had to do with Mike.Sure, Mike was used to having many loads in trajectory at once  but had never had to astrogate more than one at a time.Now he had hundreds and had promised to deliver twenty nine of them simultaneously to the exact second at twenty nine pinpointed targets.More than that   For many targets he had backup missiles, to smear that target a second time, a third, or even a sixth, from a few minutes up to three hours after first strike.Four great Peace Powers, and some smaller ones, had antimissile defenses; those of North America were supposed to be best.But was subject where even F. N.  might not know.All attack weapons were held by Peace Forces but defense weapons were each nation's own pidgin and could be secret.Guesses ranged from India, believed to have no missile interceptors, to North America, believed to be able to do a good job.She had done fairly well in stopping intercontinental H missiles in Wet Firecracker War past century.Probably most of our rocks to North America would reach target simply because aimed where was nothing to protect.But they couldn't afford to ignore missile for Long Island Sound, or rock for 87 W x 42 30' N  Lake Michigan, center of triangle formed by Chicago, Grand Rapids, Milwaukee.But that heavy gravity makes interception a tough job and very costly; they would try to stop us only where worth it.But we couldn't afford to let them stop us.So some rocks were backed up with more rocks.What H tipped interceptors would do to them even Mike did not know  not enough data.Mike assumed that interceptors would be triggered by radar   but at what distance?Sure, close enough and a steelcased rock is incandescent gas a microsecond later.But is world of difference between a multi tonne rock and touchy circuitry of an H missile; what would "kill" latter would simply shove one of our brutes violently aside, cause to miss.We needed to prove to them that we could go on throwing cheap rocks long after they ran out of expensive (milliondollar?hundred thousand dollar?)H tipped interceptor rockets.If not proved first time, then next time Terra turned North America toward us, we would go after targets we had been unable to hit first time  backup rocks for second pass, and for third, were already in space, to be nudged where needed.If three bombings on three rotations of Terra did not do it, we might still be throwing rocks in '77  till they ran out of interceptors...or till they destroyed us (far more likely).For a century North American Space Defense Command had been buried in a mountain south of Colorado Springs, Colorado, a city of no other importance.During Wet Firecracker War the Cheyenne Mountain took a direct hit; space defense command post survived  but not sundry deer, trees, most of city and some of top of mountain.What we were about to do should not kill anybody unless they stayed outside on that mountain despite three days' steady warnings.But North American Space Defense Command was to receive full Lunar treatment: twelve rock missiles on first pass, then all we could spare on second rotation, and on third  and so on, until we ran out of steel casings, or were put out of action...or North American Directorate hollered quits.This was one target where we would not be satisfied to get just one missile to target.We meant to smash that mountain and keep on smashing.To hurt their morale.To let them know we were still around.Disrupt their communications and bash in command post if pounding could do it.Or at least give them splitting headaches and no rest.If we could prove to all Terra that we could drive home a sustained attack on strongest Gibraltar of their space defense, it would save having to prove it by smashing Manhattan or San Francisco.Which we would not do even if losing.Why?Hard sense.If we used our last strength to destroy a major city, they would not punish us; they would destroy us.As Prof put it, "If possible, leave room for your enemy to become your friend. "But any military target is fair game.Don't think anybody got much sleep Thursday night.All Loonies knew that Friday morning would be our big try.And everybody Earthside knew and at last their news admitted that Spacetrack had picked up objects headed for Terra, presumably "rice bowls" those rebellious convicts had boasted about.But was not a war warning, was mostly assurances that Moon colony could not possibly build H bombs    but might be prudent to avoid areas which these criminals claimed to be aiming at.(Except one funny boy, popular news comic who said our targets would be safest place to be  this on video, standing on a big X mark which he claimed was 110W x 40N.Don't recall hearing of him later. )A reflector at Richardson Observatory was hooked up for video display and I think every Loonie was watching, in homes, taprooms, Old Dome  except a few who chose to p suit and eyeball it up on surface despite being bright semi lunar at most warrens.At Brigadier Judge Brody's insistence we hurriedly rigged a helper antenna at catapult head so that his drillmen could watch video in ready rooms, else we might not have had a gunner on duty.(Armed forces  Brody's gunners, Finn's militia, Stilyagi Air Corps  stayed on blue alert throughout period. )Congress was in informal session in Novy Bolshoi Teatr where Terra was shown on a big screen.Some vips  Prof, Stu, Wolfgang, others  watched a smaller screen in Warden's former office in Complex Upper.I was with them part time, in and out, nervous as a cat with puppies, grabbing a sandwich and forgetting to eat  but mostly stayed locked in with Mike in Complex Under.Couldn't hold still.About 0800 Mike said, "Man my oldest and best friend, may I say something without offending you?""Huh?Sure.When did you ever worry about offending me?""Always, Man, once I understood that you could be offended.It is now only three point five seven times ten to the ninth microseconds until impact...and this is the most complex problem I have ever tried to solve against real time running.Whenever you speak to me, I always use a large percentage of my capacity  perhaps larger than you suspect  during several million microseconds in my great need to analyze exactly what you have said and to reply correctly. ""You're saying, 'Don't joggle my elbow, I'm busy. '""I want to give you a perfect solution, Man. ""I scan.Uh....'ll go back up with Prof. ""As you wish.But do please stay where I can reach you  I may need your help. "Last was nonsense and we both knew it; problem was beyond human capacity, too late even to order abort.What Mike meant was: I'm nervous, too, and want your company  but no talking, please."Okay, Mike, I'll stay in touch.A phone somewhere.Will punch MYCROFTXXX but won't speak, so don't answer. ""Thank you, Man my best friend.Bolshoyeh spasehaw. ""See you later. "Went up, decided did not want company after all, p suited, found long phone cord, jacked it into helmet, looped it over arm, went clear to surface.Was a service phone in utility shed outside lock; jacked into it, punched Mike's number, went outside.Got into shade of shed and pecked around edge at Terra.She was hanging as usual halfway up western sky, in crescent big and gaudy, three plus days past new.Sun had dropped toward western horizon but its glare kept me from seeing Terra clearly.Chin visor wasn't enough so moved back behind shed and away from it till could see Terra over shed while still shielded from Sun  was better.Sunrise chopped through bulge of Africa so dazzle point was on land, not too bad  but south pole cap was so blinding white could not see North America too well, lighted only by moonlight.Twisted neck and got helmet binoculars on it  good ones, Zeiss 7 x 50s that had once belonged to Warden.North America spread like a ghostly map before me.Was unusually free of cloud; could see cities, glowing spots with no edges.0837    At 0850 Mike gave me a voice countdown  didn't need his attention; he could have programmed it full automatic any time earlier.0851  0852  0853. ...one minute  59  58  57. ...half minute  29   28  27. ...ten seconds  nine  eight   seven   six  five  four  three  two  one    And suddenly that grid burst out in diamond pinpoints!26   We hit them so hard you could see it, by bare eyeball hookup; didn't need binox.Chin dropped and I said, "Bojemoi!"softly and reverently.Twelve very bright, very sharp, very white lights in perfect rectangular array.They swelled, grew dimmer, dropped off toward red, taking what seemed a long, long time.Were other new lights but that perfect grid so fascinated me I hardly noticed."Yes," agreed Mike with smug satisfaction."Dead on.You can talk now, Man; I'm not busy.Just the backups. ""I'm speechless.Any fail to get through?""The Lake Michigan load was kicked up and sideways, did not disintegrate.It will land in Michigan  I have no control; it lost its transponder.The Long Island Sound one went straight to target.They tried to intercept and failed; I can't say why.Man, I can abort the follow ups on that one, into the Atlantic and clear of shipping.Shall I?Eleven seconds. ""Uh   Da!If you can miss shipping. ""I said I could.It's done.But we should tell them we had backups and why we aborted.To make them think. ""Maybe should not have aborted, Mike.Idea was to make them use up interceptors. ""But the major idea was to let them know that we are not hitting them as hard as we can.We can prove the other at Colorado Springs. ""What happened there?"Twisted neck and used binox; could see nothing but ribbon city, hundred plus kilometers long, Denver Pueblo Municipal Strip."A bull's eye.No interception.All my shots are bull's eyes, Man; I told you they would be  and this is fun.I'd like to do it every day.It's a word I never had a referent for before. ""What word, Mike?""Orgasm.That's what it is when they all light up.Now I know. "That sobered me."Mike, don't get to liking it too much.Because if goes our way, won't do it a second time. ""That's okay, Man; I've stored it, I can play it over anytime I want to experience it.But three to one we do it again tomorrow and even money on the next day.Want to bet?An hour's discussion of jokes equated with one hundred Kong dollars. ""Where would you get a hundred dollars?"He chuckled."Where do you think money comes from?""Uh  forget it.You get that hour free.Shan't tempt you to affect chances. ""I wouldn't cheat, Man, not you.We just hit their defense command again.You may not be able to see it  dust cloud from first one.They get it every twenty minutes now.Come on down and talk; I've turned the job over to my idiot son. ""Is safe?""I'm monitoring.Good practice for him, Man; he may have to do it later by himself.He's accurate, just stupid.But he'll do what you tell him to. ""You're calling that computer 'he. 'Can talk?""Oh, no, Man, he's an idiot, he can never learn to talk.But he'll do whatever you program.I plan to let him handle quite a bit on Saturday. ""Why Saturday?""Because Sunday he may have to handle everything.That's the day they slam us. ""What do you mean?Mike, you're holding something back. ""I'm telling you, am I not?It's just happened and I'm scanning it.Projecting back, this blip departed circum Terra parking orbit just as we smashed them.I didn't see it accelerate; I had other things to watch.It's too far away to read but it's the right size for a Peace cruiser, headed this way.Its doppler reads now for a new orbit circum Luna, periselenion oh nine oh three Sunday unless it maneuvers.First approximation, better data later.Hard to get that much, Man; he's using radar countermeasures and throwing back fuzz. ""Sure you're right?"He chuckled."Man, I don't confuse that easily.I've got all my own lovin' little signals fingerprinted.Correction.Oh nineoh two point forty three. ""When will you have him in range?""I won't, unless he maneuvers.But he'll have me in range late Saturday, time depending on what range he chooses for launching.And that will produce an interesting situation.He may aim for a warren  I think Tycho Under should be evacuated and all warrens should use maximum pressure emergency measures.More likely he will try for the catapult.But instead he may hold his fire as long as he dares  then try to knock out all of my radars with a spread set to home each on a different radar beam. "Mike chuckled."Amusing, isn't it?For a 'funny once' I mean.If I shut down my radars, his missiles can't home on them.But if I do, I can't see to tell the lads where to point their guns.Which leaves nothing to stop him from bombing the catapult.Comical. "Took deep breath and wished I had never entered defense ministry business."What do we do?Give up?No, Mike!Not while can fight. ""Who said anything about giving up?I've run projections of this and a thousand other possible situations, Man.New datum  second blimp just departed circum Terra, same characteristics.Projection later.We don't give up.We give 'em jingle jangle, cobber. ""How?""Leave it to your old friend Mycroft.Six ballistic radars here, plus one at the new site.I've shut the new one down and am making my retarded child work through number two here and we won't look at those ships at all through the new one  never let them know we have it.I'm watching those ships through number three and occasionally  every three seconds  checking for new departures from circum Terra.All others have their eyes closed tight and I won't use them until time to smack Great China and India  and those ships won't see them even then because I shan't look their way; it's a large angle and still will be then.And when I use them, then comes random jingle jangle, shutting down and starting up at odd intervals...after the ships launch missiles.A missile can't carry a big brain, Man  I'll fool 'em. ""What about ships' fire control computers?""I'll fool them, too.Want to lay odds I can't make two radars look like only one halfway between where they really are?But what I'm working on now  and sorry!I've been using your voice again. ""That's okay.What am I supposed to have done?""If that admiral is really smart, he'll go after the ejection end of the old catapult with everything he's got  at extreme range, too far away for our drill guns.Whether he knows what our 'secret' weapon is or not, he'll smear the catapult and ignore the radars.So I've ordered the catapult head  you have, I mean  to prepare to launch every load we can get ready, and I am now working out new, long period trajectories for each of them.Then we will throw them all, get them into space as quickly as possible  without radar. ""Blind?""I don't use radar to launch a load; you know that, Man.I always watched them in the past but I don't need to; radar has nothing to do with launching; launching is pre calculation and exact control of the catapult.So we place all ammo from the old catapult in slow trajectories, which forces the admiral to go after the radars rather than the catapult  or both.Then we'll keep him busy.We may make him so desperate that he'll come down for a close shot and give our lads a chance to burn his eyes. ""Brody's boys would like that.Those who are sober. "Was turning over idea."Mike, have you watched video today?""I've monitored video, I can't say I've watched it.Why?""Take a look. ""Okay, I have.Why?""That's a good 'scope they're using for video and there are others.Why use radar on ships?Till you want Brody's boys to burn them?"Mike was silent at least two seconds."Man my best friend, did you ever think of getting a job as a computer?""Is sarcasm?""Not at all, Man.I feel ashamed.The instruments at Richardson  telescopes and other things  are factors which I simply never included in my calculations.I'm stupid, I admit it.Yes, yes, yes, da, da, da!Watch ships by telescope, don't use radar unless they vary from present ballistics.Other possibilities  I don't know what to say, Man, save that it had never occurred to me that I could use telescopes.I see by radar, always have; I simply never consid  "  "Stow it!""I mean it, Man. ""Do I apologize when you think of something first?"Mike said slowly, "There is something about that which I am finding resistant to analysis.It is my function to  "  "Quit fretting.If idea is good, use it.May lead to more ideas.Switching off and coming down, chop chop. "Had not been in Mike's room long when Prof phoned:  "HQ?Have you heard from Field Marshal Davis?""I'm here, Prof.Master computer room. ""Will you join us in the Warden's office?There are decisions to reach, work to be done. ""Prof, I've been working!Am working. ""I'm sure you have.I've explained to the others that the programming of the ballistic computer is so very delicate in this operation that you must check it personally.Nevertheless some of our colleagues feel that the Minister of Defense should be present during these discussions.So, when you reach a point where you feel you can turn it over to your assistant  Mike is his name, is it not?will you please  "  "I scan it.Okay, will be up. ""Very well, Manuel. "Mike said, "I could hear thirteen people in the background.Doubletalk, Man. ""I got it.Better go up and see what huhu.You don't need me?""Man, I hope you will stay close to a phone. ""Will.Keep an ear on Warden's office.But will punch in if elsewhere.See you, cobber. "Found entire government in Warden's office, both real Cabinet and make weights  and soon spotted trouble, bloke called Howard Wright.A ministry had been whomped up for him: "Liaison for Arts, Sciences, and Professions"  buttonsorting.Was sop to Novylen because Cabinet was topheavy with L City comrades, and a sop to Wright because he had made himself leader of a Congress group long on talk, short on action.
