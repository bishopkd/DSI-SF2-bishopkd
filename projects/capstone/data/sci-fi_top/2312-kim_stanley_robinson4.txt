Id lose the thread in a lot of those, Im afraid.Maybe not in the late quartets.Ive lived to those sweet things.Id have to try and see how it went.How can you remember so many?For a long time thats all I listened to.Thats crazy.All right, try the Fourth, then.You can take them in order.Later, please.I have to rest.My lips are already destroyed, I can feel them twice as big.Theyre like a big old gasket right now.She laughed and let him be.An hour later, however, she brought it back up, and sounded like she would be very discouraged if he didnt do it.All right, but you join me, he said.But I dont know the tunes.I dont really remember the stuff I hear people play.That doesnt matter, Wahram said.Just whistle.You said you did.I do, but it sounds like this.She whistled for a while: a glorious burble of music, exactly like some kind of songbird.Wow, you sound just like a bird, he said.Very fluid glissandos, and I dont know whats, but just like a bird.Yes, thats right.I have some skylark polyps in me.You mean in your brain?Bird brains, put into your own?Yes.Alauda arvensis.Also some Sylvia borin, the garden warbler.But you know that birds brains are organized on completely different lines than mammal brains?No.I thought everyone knew that.Some qube architecture is based on bird brains, so it got discussed for a while.I didnt know.Well, the thinking that we mammals do in layers of cells across our cortex, birds do in clusters of cells, distributed like bunches of grapes.I didnt know that.So you can take some of your own stem cells and introduce skylark song node DNA into them, and then you can introduce it through the nose to the brain, and it makes a little cluster in the limbic system.Then when you whistle, the cluster links into your already existing musical networks.All those are very old parts.Theyre almost like bird parts of the brain already.So the new ones get hooked in, and off you go.You did this?Yes.How did it feel?For answer she whistled.In the tunnel one liquid glissando led to another: bright birdsong, there in the tunnel with them.Amazing, Wahram said.I didnt know you could do that.You should be the one whistling, not me.You dont mind?On the contrary.So she whistled as they walked along, sometimes for the full hour between breaks.Her burble shifted through all kinds of phases and phrases, and it seemed to Wahram these were so various they must be the songs of more than two species of bird.But he wasnt sure, as it occurred to him also that she might be as vocally limited by her body as any bird, so these could perhaps be just the variety of songs that a real songbird sang.Glorious music!It was somewhat like Debussy at times, and of course there were Messiaens specific imitations of birds; but Swans whistling was stranger, more repetitive, with endless permutations of little figures, often repeating in insistent ostinato trills that got their hooks into him, sometimes to the point of irritation.When she stopped, he could still call to mind some of her tunes.Whales had songs, of course, but birds must have been the first musicians.Unless dinosaurs too had made music.He seemed to recall something about big hollows in certain hadrosaur skulls, inexplicable except as sounding devices.The sound one of those would have made was interesting to try to imagine.He even hummed a bit, testing how it would feel in his own big barrel of a chest.So was that the bird, or you?he asked when she took a pause.We are the same, she said.After a while she said, Mozarts pet starling once revised a phrase he wrote.The bird sang it after he played it on the piano, but changed all the sharps to flats.Mozart described it happening in the margin of the score.That was beautiful!he wrote.When the bird died, he sang at its funeral, and read a poem to it.And his next composition, which the publisher called A Musical Joke, had a starling style.Nice, Wahram said.Its true that birds always look intelligent.Not doves, she said.But then, in a dark tone: You can either have high specific intelligence or high general intelligence, but not both.Wahram didnt know what to say to that; the thought had turned her suddenly grim.Well, he said.We should whistle together.So well have both?What?Never mind.All right.So he went back to the Eroica, and this time she whistled along, in an avian counterpoint or descant to the melodies.Her parts fit his in the manner of internal cadenzas, or jazz improvisations, and at Beethovens more heroic moments, which came pretty frequently, her additions rose to a furious pace of invention, sounding as if the bird inside her had been driven into a fit by Beethovens audacity.They whistled some very stirring duets.It definitely passed the time in ways that it hadnt passed before.You needed the gift of time, he thought, to explore a pleasure like this.He could go through all the Beethoven he knew; and after them, the four symphonies of Brahms, so noble and heartfelt; also the last three symphonies of Tchaikovsky.All the great parts of the soundtrack of his oh so romantic youth.Meanwhile Swan was up for anything, and her augmentations added a wild baroque or avant garde touch to the tunes, additions that often amazed him.The piercing quality of her sound must have carried a long way up and down the tunnel, and sometimes the sunwalkers would slow down and walk just ahead of them, bouncing in time to the music, even whistling themselves, inexpertly but enthusiastically.The finale of Beethovens Seventh was particularly successful with them as marching music; and when they got up after a rest to take up their walking again, the sunwalkers often requested the horn cry that began Tchaikovskys Fourth, then its first theme, so full of the feeling that there was a fate ruling them now, a fate dark and grand.At the end of one of their shared performances of Beethovens Ninth, they all shook their heads in wonder, and Nar turned back and said, Sirs, you certainly are good whistlers!What tunes!Well, Wahram said.Those are Beethoven.Oh!I thought they called it whistling.We thought you were making them up, Tron added.We were impressed.Later, when the three youths had gotten ahead, Wahram said, Are all the sunwalkers like that?No!Swan said, annoyed.I told you, Im a sunwalker myself.He did not want her annoyed.Tell me, do you have anything else interesting added to your brain?I do.She still sounded sour.Theres an earlier AI, from when I was a child, put in my corpus callosum to help deal with some convulsions I was having.And a bit of one loverwe thought wed share some of our sexual responses and see where that led us.Which was nowhere, as it turned out, but I presume that bit is still in there.And theres other stuff too, but I dont want to talk about it.Oh dear.Is it confusing?Not at all.Grimmer and grimmer she sounded.What, dont you have anything in you?In a way.I suppose everyone does, he said reassuringly, though in fact he had seldom heard of a brain with as many interventions as hers.I take some vasopressin and some oxytocin, as recommended.Those both come from vasotocin, she said authoritatively.Theres just one amino acid of difference between the three.So I take the vasotocin.Its very old, so old it controls sex behavior in frogs.My.No, its just what you need.I dont know.I feel fine with the oxytocin and vasopressin.Oxytocin is social memory, she said.You dont notice other people without it.I need more of it.Vasopressin too, I suppose.The monogamy hormone, Wahram said.Monogamy in males.But only three percent of mammals are monogamous.Even birds do better than that, I think.Swans, Wahram suggested.Yes.And I am Swan Second Swan.But Im not monogamous.No?No.Except Im faithful to endorphins.He frowned, but assumed she was joking and tried to go along.Isnt that just like having a dog or something?I like dogs.Dogs are wolves.But wolves are not monogamous.No.But endorphins are.He sighed, feeling he had lost her point, or that she had.Its the touch of the beloved that stimulates endorphins, he said, and left it at that.You couldnt whistle the end of the Moonlight Sonata.That night, as they slept in the tunnel on their little aerogel mattresses under their thin blankets, he awoke to find that Swan had moved, and was sleeping against him back to back.The resulting flood of oxytocin relieved his sore hips a little; this was how one could read it.Of course the urge to sleep with someone, the pleasure in sleeping with someone, was not exactly synonymous with sex.Which was reassuring.Across the floor indeed the three ferals were curled together like kittens.The tunnels were warm, often too warm, but right on the floor it got cold.Very faintly he heard her purring.Feline genes for sameyes, he had heard of itpeople said it felt good, very like humming.Feel pleasure, purr, feel better: a positive feedback into more pleasure, loop, loop, loop, all at the pace of breathing, it sounded like when he listened to her.A different kind of music.Although he knew very well that sick cats sometimes purred at a momentary relief, or even as if hoping to feel better, trying to jump start the loop.He had lived with a cat who had done that near its end.A fifty year old cat is an impressive creature.The loss of this ancient eunuch had been one of Wahrams first losses, so he remembered its purr near the end as particularly pitiful, the sound of some emotion too crowded to name.A good friend of his had died purring.So now this purr from Swan gave him a little shiver of worry.Down the tunnel after a sleep, groggy and dim.The morning hour.Whistle the slow movement from the Eroica, Beethovens funeral music for his sense of hearing, written as it was dying inside him.We live an hour and it is always the same,  he recited.Then the slow movement of the first of the late quartets, opus 127, variations on a theme, so rich; as majestic as the funeral march, but more hopeful, more in love with beauty.And then the third movement that followed was so strong and cheerful it could have been a fourth movement.Swan gave him a black look.Damn you, she said, youre enjoying this.His bass croak of laughter felt good in his chest, a little hadrosauric.Danger to him was like wine,  he growled.Whats that?The Oxford English Dictionary.Or thats where I saw it.You like quotations.We have come a long way, we have a long way to go.In between we are somewhere.Come on, whats that?A fortune cookie?Reinhold Messner, I believe.He really was kind of enjoying it, he had to admit.Only twenty five more days, more or less; it wasnt such a big number.He could endure.It was the most iterative pseudoiterative he would ever live, thus interesting, as a kind of limit case of what he supposedly wanted.A reductio ad absurdum.And the tunnel was not so much a matter of sensory deprivation as it was sensory overload, but in very few elements: the walls of the tunnel, the lights running along its ceiling fore and aft for as far as they could see.But Swan was not enjoying it.This particular day seemed worse than any before, in fact.She even slowed down, something he had never seen before, to the point where he had to slow down a bit to keep from getting well ahead of her.Are you all right?he asked after waiting for her to catch up.No.I feel like crap.I guess its happening.Do you feel anything?In fact Wahram was sore in his hips, knees, and feet.His ankles were all right.His back was all right once he got walking.Im sore, he admitted.Im worried about that last solar flare we saw.By the time you see one of those, theres faster radiation thats come off the snap.Im afraid we might have gotten cooked.I feel shitty.Im just sore.But then, you covered me at the elevator.It probably hit us differently.I hope so.Lets ask the ferals how they feel.They did at the next stop, where, by the looks on their faces, the sunwalkers had waited long enough to be concerned.Tron said, How goes it?Im feeling sick, Swan said.How are you three feeling?They looked at each other.All right, Tron said.No nausea or diarrhea?No headaches or muscle soreness?No hair coming out?The three sunwalkers looked at each other, shrugged.They had gone down the elevator earlier.Im not very hungry, Tron said, but the food isnt very good.My arm is still sore, Nar offered.Swan looked resentfully at them.They were sunwalkers, young and strong; they were doing what they did all the time, except underground and widdershins.She looked at Wahram.What about you?Wahram said, Im sore.I cant go much faster than I already am, or longer, or something will break.Swan nodded.Same for me.I may even have to slow down.I feel bad.So I wonder if the three of you should hurry on ahead, and when you get to the sunset, or run into people, you can tell them about us.The sunwalkers nodded.How will we know when were there?Tron asked.In a couple of weeks, when you come to stations, you can go up in the elevator and have a look.All right.Tron looked at Tor and Nar, and they all nodded.Well go get help.Thats right.Dont go out so fast you hurt yourselves.After that Wahram and Swan walked on their own.An hour walking, a half hour sitting, over and over for nine times; then a long meal and a sleep.An hour was a long time; nine of them, with their rests, felt like a couple of weeks.They whistled from time to time, but Swan was not feeling well, and Wahram did not want to do it on his own, unless she asked him to.She stopped and fell back in the tunnel from time to time to relieve herself; Ive got the runs, she said at one point, Ive got to empty my suit.After that she only would say, Wait a minute, and then, after five or ten minutes, catch up to him again, and on they would go.She looked desiccated.She became irritable and often spoke viciously to Pauline, and sometimes to Wahram too.Querulous, disagreeable, unpleasant.Wahram would get annoyed with how unfair she was, how pointless the unpleasantness she created out of nothing, and he would hike along speechlessly, whistling dark little fragments under his breath.In these moments he struggled to remember a lesson from his crche, which was that with moody people you had to discount the low points in their cycle, or it would not work at all.His crche had numbered six, and one had been moody to the point of bipolarity, and in the end this had been what caused the group to semi disband, Wahram believed; he himself had been one of those least able to see that person in their whole amplitude.Six people had thirty relationships in it, and hex wisdom had it that all but one or two of these had to be good for a crche to endure.They hadnt even come close to that, but later Wahram had realized that the moody one in the upper half of his cycle was one of the people he most missed out of the group.Had to recall that and learn from it.Then a time came when ten minutes passed with Swan back down the hall, and she didnt return; and then he thought he heard a groan.So he went back and found her sprawled on the floor, semiconscious at best, with her spacesuit down her to ankles and her excretion obviously interrupted midcourse.And she was indeed groaning.Oh no!he said, and crouched by her side.She had her long sleeved shirt still on, but under it her flesh was blue with cold on the side that had been on the ground.Swan, can you hear me?Are you hurt?He held up her head; her eyes were swimming a little.Damn, he said.He didnt want to pull her spacesuit up over the mess between her legs.Here, he said, Im going to clean you up.Like anyone he had done his share of diaper changes, on both babies and elders, and knew the drill.And one pocket of his suit had his toilet tissues; he himself had had to deploy them in a hurry a few times recently, which now worried him more than it had.And he had water, and even some moist pads in foil packets, courtesy of his suit.So he got them out and shifted her legs around and cleaned her up.Even with his eyes averted he could not help seeing in the tangle of her pubic hair a small penis and testicles, about where her clitoris might have been, or just above.A gynandromorph; it did not surprise him.He finished cleaning her up, trying to be meticulous but fast, and then he pulled her arms over his shoulders and lifted hershe was heavier than he would have thoughtand pulled up her spacesuit, and got the top part around her waist and sat her back down on the ground.Got the arms of the suit onto her.Happily a suits AI worked Jeeveslike to help the occupant into it.He considered her little backpack, there on the ground; it had to be taken.He decided to put it back on her.With all that arranged, he lifted her up and carried her before him in his arms.Her head lolled back too far for his liking and he stopped.Swan, can you hear me?She groaned, blinked.He got his arm behind her neck and head and hefted her up again.What?she said.You passed out, he said.While you were having the runs.Oh, she said.She pulled her head upright, put her arms around his neck.He started walking again.She was not that heavy, now that he had her help in holding her.I could feel a vasovagal coming on, she said.Am I getting my period again?No, I dont think so.It feels like it, Im cramping.But I dont think I have enough body fat to do it.Maybe not.Suddenly she jerked in his arms, pulled away to look at him face to face.Oh my.Hey looksome people dont like to touch me.I have to tell you.You know those people who ingest some of the aliens from Enceladus?Ingest?Yes.An infusion of that bacterial suite.They eat some of the Enceladans; its supposed to be good for you.I did that.A long time ago.So, well, some people dont like the idea.Dont even like to be in contact with a person whos done it.Wahram gulped uneasily, felt a jolt of queasiness.Was that the alien bug, or just the thought of the bug?No way to tell.What was done was done, he could not change it.As I recall, he said, the Enceladan life suite is not regarded as being particularly infectious?No, thats right.But it is conveyed in bodily fluids.I mean, it has to get into your blood, I think.Although I drank mine.Maybe it only has to get into the gut; thats right.Thats why people worry.So  Ill be all right, Wahram said.He carried her for a while, aware that she was inspecting his face.Judging by what he saw in the mirror when he shaved, he did not think there would be much to see.Without intending to, he said, Youve done some strange things to yourself.She made a face and looked away.Moral condemnation of other people is always rather rude, dont you think?Yes, I do.Of course.Though I notice we do it all the time.But I was speaking of strangeness only.No condemnation implied.Oh sure.Strangeness is so good.Well, isnt it?Were all strange.She turned her head to look at him again.I am, I know that.In lots of ways.You saw another way, I suppose.Glancing at her lap.Yes, Wahram said.Although thats not what makes you strange.She laughed weakly.Youve fathered children?he asked.Yes.I suppose you think thats strange too.Yes, he said seriously.Though I am an androgyn, myself, and once gave birth to a child.So, you knowit strikes me as a very strange experience, no matter which way it happens.She pulled her head back to inspect him, clearly surprised.I didnt know that.It wasnt really relevant to ones actions in the present, Wahram said.Part of ones past, you know.And anyway, it seems to me most spacers of a certain age have tried almost everything, dont you think?I guess so.How old are you?Im a hundred and eleven, thank you.What about you?A hundred and thirty five.Very nice.She shifted in his arms, lifting a fist in a mime of threatening him.By way of a riposte he said, Do you think you can walk now?Maybe.Let me try.He put her feet down, pulled her upright.She leaned against him.She hobbled along for a bit holding his arm, then stood straight and proceeded on her own, slowly.We dont have to walk, you know, he said.I mean, we can get to the next station and wait there.Lets see how I feel.We can decide when we get there.Wahram said, Do you think it was the sun that made you sick?Because I must say, for being in M g, Im feeling very sore in my joints.She shrugged.We took a shot big enough to kill our comms.Pauline says I took ten sieverts.Wow.The LD 50 was about thirty, he thought.My wristpad would have flagged it if Id taken that much.I checked and it was only up three.But you covered me while we were waiting for the elevator.Well, there was no reason both of us should take a full hit.I suppose.But we could have taken turns.You didnt know about the flare.Whats your lifetime total?Im at around two hundred, he said.They all relied on the DNA repair component of the longevity treatment to stay in space as much as they did.Not bad, she said.Im at five.She sighed.This could be it.Or maybe it just killed the bacteria in my gut.I think thats whats happened.I hope.Although my hair is falling out too.My joints are probably just sore from all the walking, Wahram said.Could be.What do you do for aerobics?I walk.Thats not much of a test of your aerobic system.I huff and I puff as I walk and I talk.Trying to distract her.Another quote?I think I made that up.One of my mantras for the daily routine.Daily routine.I like routine.No wonder youre happy in here.Its true that there is a routine here.They trudged down the tunnel in silence for a long time.When they got to the next station, they declared it a day and settled in to rest a few extra hours, as well as sleep through their night.Once Swan walked back down the tunnel to do something, then returned, and she fell asleep and seemed to sleep well, without purring.The next morning she wanted to carry on walking, declaring she would go slow and be careful.So off they went.The lights kept appearing ahead out of the distant floor, then up and over them in their long arc.The effect was as if they were always about to walk downhill.Wahram tried to keep sight of one particular light, but could not be sure he had kept track of it from its first appearance to overhead.It could be some kind of unit: the view to horizon; multiplied how many times, he was not quite sure.Can you ask Pauline to calculate our view distance to the horizon?he asked at one point.I know it, Swan said shortly.Its three kilometers.I see.Suddenly it didnt seem to make much difference.Shall we whistle?Wahram asked after they had walked in silence for half an hour.No, she said.Im all whistled out.Tell me a story.Tell me your story, I want to hear more things that I dont know about you.Easy enough, to be sure.Although suddenly he could not think exactly how to start.Well, I was born a hundred and eleven years ago, on Titan.My mother was a wombman who came originally from Callisto, a third generation Jovian, and my father was an androgyn from Mars, exiled in one of their political conflicts.I grew up mostly on Titan, but it was very constrained in those days, a matter of stations and just a few small domes.So I also lived in Herschel for some years as I went to school, then also on Phoebe, and one of the polar orbiters, and then, recently, Iapetus.Almost everyone in the Saturn system moves around to get a sense of the whole, especially if youre involved with the civil service.Do many people do that?Everyone has to do the basic training, and give a certain amount of time to Saturn, as they say, and they may also get drafted in the lottery for some position in the government.Some get drafted and grow to like it and then do more.Thats what I did.One of my last mandatories was on Hyperion, and it was very small, but I really grew fond of that place, it was so strange.Theres that word again.Well, life is strange, or so it seems to me.He sang, People are strange, when youre a stranger, and then cut it short.Hyperion is truly strange.Its apparently the remnant of a collision between two moons of about equal size.Whats left looks like the side of a honeycomb, and the ridges bracketing the holes are white, while the powder filling every hole about halfway is black.So when you walk the ridges, or float over that side of the moon, it is very like some supremely bold work of art.A big old goldsworthy, she said.Sort of.And its an easy place to disturb by ones presence.So its been a question how to set up a station, even whether to set one up, and how it should be run if one is put there permanently.Having helped with that, I have the sense of being a curator or something.Interesting.I thought so.So, I went back to Iapetus, which is also a superb place to live; its kind of a pulling back, and at an angle, to give you a better view of the whole system, and of why it should evoke such feeling.There I studied terraforming governance, and the diplomatic arts, such as they are  The honest man sent by his country to lie for it?Oh, I would hope that is not an accurate description of a diplomat.Its not mine, and I hope not yours.I dont think we get to choose what words mean.No?I think we do.Only within very tight limits, she said.But go on.Well, after that I went back to Titan and worked on the terraforming there.In those years I had my children.With partners?Yes, my crche had six parents and eight children.I see them all from time to time.Its almost always a pleasure.I try not to worry about them.I love the kids; I remember parts of their lives they dont remember themselves.I think thats of more interest to me than to them.Thats all right.Memory is a haunting.You remember times you liked, and you want something like them.But you can only get new things.So I try to want what I get.It isnt obvious how to do it.You get into your second century and it gets hard, I think.It was never not hard, she said.True.This world is very mysterious to me.I mean, I hear what people say about the universe, but I dont know how to put it to use.To me it sounds meaningless.So I agree with those who say we have to make our own meaning.The concept of the project I find useful.Something you do in the present, and can remember doing in the past, and expect to do in the future, in order to create something.A work of art which need not be in the arts per se, but something human worth doing.Thats existentialism, yes?Yes, I think thats right.I dont see how you can avoid it.Hmm.She thought about it.The light gleamed off her black hair in white streaks.Tell me about your crche.How did that work?On Titan there would be groups of people around the same age, who were educated together and worked together.Smaller cohorts would band together out of these to raise children.Usually it was in groups of half a dozen or so.There were different ways to structure them.It depended on compatibilities.There was a feeling at the time that pair bonds didnt have enough people in them to endure over the long haulthat they succeeded less than half the time, and children needed more.So there would be some larger number.Almost everyone thought of it as a child raising method and not a lifelong arrangement.Thus the name crche.Eventually there were a lot of hurt feelings involved.But if youre lucky, it can be good for a while, and you just have to take that and move on when the time comes.I still stay in touch with them; were even still a crche.But the kids are grown, and we very rarely see each other.I see.A long time of silent walking passed, and Wahram was feeling rather companionable, and not too sore.Then Swan said vehemently, I cant stand it in here.Theres no chance of changing.Its like a prison, or a school.Our submercurial life, he said, just a little offended, as he had been enjoying himself.On the other hand, she was ill.It will soon enough come to an end.Not soon enough.She shook her head gloomily.They walked on, hour after hour.Everything stayed the same.Swan walked better than she had right after her collapse, but she was still slower than she had been before it.It didnt matter to Wahram; he liked the slower pace, in fact.He was still quite sore in the mornings, but did not seem to be getting any worse; nor did he feel weak or nauseous, though he was on the lookout for the symptoms in an uncomfortable way.He felt queasy a lot.Swan had pulled off all the hair on her head, leaving a fair number of scabby patches.What about you?he said at one point.Tell me more about you.Did you really lie naked on blocks of ice for hours at a time?Did you cut orreries into your skin and make patterns of blood on you?She was walking ahead of him, and now she hesitated, then stopped and let him take the lead.I dont want to shout back at you, she said as he passed her.And yes, she said as they carried on, I did do those things, and other kinds of abramovics.The body is very good material for art, I think.But that was mostly when I was in my fifties.What about before?I was born in Terminator, as I said.It was just being constructed, and I was a kid in the farm when they were still putting in the irrigation systems.It was a big deal when the soil arrived.It came out of big tubes, like wet cement, only black.I played in there with my mother while they were getting the first crops and the park plants started.It was a great place to be a kid.Its hard to believe that itll all be dead when we come up.Ill have to see it to believe it.Anyway thats where I grew up.The past is always gone, Wahram said.Whether the place is still there or not.Maybe for you, oh sage one, she said.I never felt that way.Anyway, after that I lived on Venus for a while, working for Shukra.Then I designed terraria.Then I moved into making artworks, working with landscapes or bodies.Goldsworthies and abramovics, still very interesting to me, and how I make my living.So Im out and about, following commissions.But I keep a room in Terminator.My parents both died, so my grandparents Alex and Mqaret were kind of like my parents.You couldnt have made any critique of pair bonding by looking at those two.Poor Mqaret.No, I know, he said.It was child rearing I was talking about, that seems to take more than two people.You must have learned that too?She shot him a glance.One of them is out there somewhere.The child I had with Zasha died.Im sorry.Yes, well, she was old.I dont want to talk about that right now.In fact she was slowing down, and seemed to him hunched over.He said, Are you all right?Feeling weaker.Do you want to stop and rest?No.On they struggled, in silence.He helped her through one hour, supporting her as she walked with one of his arms around her back and under her far arm, pulling up.After the rests she struggled up and continued walking, and would brook no argument against it.When they got to the next station, he looked around in every cabinet and closet in the place, and in the last closet he checked (but it was always the last one, when you found something) there was a little four wheeled pushcart with a bar on one end that rose to chest height; otherwise it was a flatbed set just above wheel height, the bed one meter by two, and the two swiveling wheels opposite the bar.Lets put our backpacks on here and Ill push them, he suggested.She gave him a look.You think you can push me around.It would be easier than carrying you, if it came to that.She dumped her backpack on the cart, and the next morning took off ahead of him.At first he had to hurry; then he caught up with her; then he slowed down as she did.Hour after hour.Without discussing it, she would sometimes sit on the cart.Up on the surface over them passed the craters and scarps named after the great artists of Earth; they went under Tsao Chan, Philoxenus, Rm, Ives.He whistled Columbia, the Gem of the Ocean, which Ives had incorporated so memorably into one of his wild compositions.He thought of Rms I Died as Mineral and wished he had it memorized better.I died as mineral and rose as a plant, I died as plant and was born an animal; when did I ever lose by dying?Who is that?Rm.More silence.Down the big curve of the tunnel.The walls here were cracked, and it looked like they had been heat treated more than usual to fuse them to impermeability.Crazed glazes of black on black.Craquelure to infinity.She groaned and stood up from the cart and walked back to the west.One moment, I have to go again.Oh dear.Good luck.After a long while he heard a distant groan, maybe even a forlorn Help.He went back down the tunnel, pulling the cart with him.She had collapsed again with her suit down.Again he had to clean her up.She was a little more conscious this time, and looked away; even at one point batted weakly at him.In the middle of his work she looked at him blearily, resentfully.This isnt really me, she said.Im not really here.Well, he said, a little offended.Im not either.She slumped back.After a while she said, So nobodys here.When he was done and she was dressed again, he got her on the cart and pushed her forward.She lay there without a word.In the next break he got her to drink some water dosed with nutrients and electrolytes.The cart, as she said at one point, was beginning to resemble a hospital bed.From time to time Wahram whistled a little, usually choosing Brahms.There was a stoic resolution at the heart of Brahmss melancholy that was very appropriate now.They still had twenty two days to go.That evening they sat there in silence.The scene devolved into the desultory animal behaviors that often followed such little crisesthe turned heads, the preparations for sleep pursued abstractedly; dull aching drop into sleep, that unseen refuge.Here the pseudoiterative needed to be held to as a comfort.Lick ones wounds.All these things had happened before and would happen again.One morning she got up and tried to walk, and after twenty minutes she sat back on the cart again.This is worrisome, she said in a small voice.If enough cells were busted  Wahram didnt say anything.He pushed her along.Suddenly it occurred to him that she could die in this tunnel and there was nothing he could do about it, and a wave of nausea passed through him, making him weak in the legs.A stay in a hospital could have done so much.After another long silence, she said in a low voice, I suppose I used to enjoy risking death.The jolt of the fear.The thrill when you survive.It was a kind of decadence.Thats what my mom used to say, Wahram said.Like horror stories, where you try to shock yourself awake or something.But all that stuff is wrong.Say you attend the death of a person and help them out.All the images you see are out of horror stories.You see that those images came from where you are.But you stay anyway.And after a time you see thats just the way it is.Everyone goes there.You help but really you cant help, you just sit there.And eventually youre holding the hand of a dead person.Supposedly a nightmare.Bones thrust up out of the ground to clutch you and so on.And yet in the actual act, perfectly natural.All of it natural.Yes?Wahram said, after she had stopped for a while.She heard him and went on.The body tries to stay alive.Its not so Its natural.Maybe youll see it now.First the human brain dies, then the animal brain, then the lizard brain.Like your Rm, only backward.The lizard brain tries to its very last bit of energy to keep things going.Ive seen it.Some kind of desire.Its a real force.Life wants to live.But eventually a link breaks.The energy stops getting to where it needs to be.The last ATP gets used.Then we die.Our bodies return to earth, go back to being soil.A natural cycle.So She looked up at him.So what?Why the horror?What are we?Wahram shrugged.Animal philosophers.An odd accident.A rarity.Or common as can be, but  She didnt continue.Dispersed?Wahram ventured.Temporary?Alone.Always alone.Even when touching someone.Well, we can talk, he said hesitantly.Thats part of life too.Its not just lizard stuff.We throw ourselves out and span the gap, sometimes.She shook her head sadly.I always fall in the gap.Hmm, he said, nonplussed.That would be bad.But I dont see how that could be right.Given what youve told me.And what Ive seen of you.Its how it feels that matters.He thought about that for a while.The lights passed them overhead, he pushed her on the cart.Was that right?Was it how you felt about what you did that made it good or bad, rather than what you did, or what others saw?Well, you were stuck in your thoughts.The current medical definition of the term neurotic was simply a tendency to have bad thoughts.If you had that tendency, he thought, looking down at Swans bare scaly head, if you were neurotic, then the material to work with would be nearly infinite.Was that true?Well, here they were, little spins of atoms which felt inside that something mattered, even while looking out at the stars, even inside a tunnel that looped downward forever.Then the spin would decohere and collapse.So, faced with that: good thoughts or bad thoughts?He whistled the beginning of Beethovens Ninth, thinking to drag her through her black mood and out the other side, by way of the old maestros deepest tragedy, the Ninths first movement.He shifted ahead to the repeated phrase near the end of the movement, the one that Berlioz had thought proof of madness.He repeated it.It was the simple tune he had used for walking uphill all his life.Now they were walking downhill, at the top of a great circle, but it fit his mood perfectly well.He kept on whistling the eight notes over and over.Six down, two up.Simple and clear.Finally Swan, sitting below him on the cart, her back against the bar he held, facing forward, spoke again, but slurring her words a bit, and talking as if to Pauline.I wonder if people know were alive.You can never tell.It meant everything at the time, but then the time changed, and you changed, and they changed.And then its gone.She doesnt have anything to say to me.Long pause.Wahram said, Who was your childs father?You had one each way?Yes.I dont know who the father was.I got pregnant on Fassnacht, when everyone is in masks.Some man I liked the look of.She knows who it is, she had him traced.You liked the look of a masked person?I did.The look of what you might call his demeanor.I see.I wanted to keep it simple.It was a conventional practice at the time.Now I wouldnt do it that way.But you never know until its too late.You develop a folie  deux for a few years, its very intense, but its a folly, and after you come out you cant look back at it without feeling You have to wonder whether it was a good thing or not.You miss it but you regret it too, its stupid.I keep on doing things, but I still havent figured out what to do.Live and make art, he said.Who said that?You did, I thought.I dont remember that.Maybe I did.But what if Im not a very good artist?Its a long term project.And some people are late bloomers, is that what youre saying?Yes, I suppose.Something like that.You keep getting chances.Maybe.But, you know, it would be good to be making progress somehow.Not making the same mistakes over and over.Spirals, he suggested.Spiral up, doing the same things at a higher level.Thats the art of it no matter what you do.Maybe for you.But theres nothing unusual about me.I beg to differ.No, nothing unusual.Principle of mediocrity.Youre an advocate of that?An exemplar of it.The middle way.Middle of the cosmos.But only just as much as anyone else.A strange feature of infinity.Were all in the middle somehow.Anyway, its a view I find useful.I use it to work on things.To structure my project, so to speak.Part of a philosophy.Philosophy.Well, yes.She fell silent at the thought.Maybe we missed it, Swan said one day as she walked behind him.Maybe we walked all the way under the brightside and the nightside too, and are back under the sun again.Maybe weve lost track of the time or the distance.Maybe youve screwed us with your ineptitude, just like Pauline.No, he said.She ignored him and muttered about things that could have gone wrong while they had been underground.It unreeled into quite an amazingly long list, gothically inventive: they could have gotten disoriented and were now actually walking west; they could have gotten into another utilidor, angled toward the north pole; Mercury could have been evacuated and them the only ones left on the planet; they could have died in the sun and the first elevator taken them down to hell.Wahram wondered if she was serious, hoped she wasnt.There was so much that made her unhappy.Circadian rhythms; possibly she was walking when she should be sleeping.Many years before, he had learned you could not trust anything you thought between two and five a. m. ; in those dark hours the brain was deprived of certain fuels or functions necessary for right mentation.Ones thoughts and moods darkened to a sometimes fugilin black.Better to sleep or, failing that, to discount in advance any thought or mood from those hours and see what a new day brought in the way of a fresh perspective.He wondered if he could ask her about this without offending her.Possibly not.She was irritable already, and seemed miserable.How are you doing?he would ask.We never get anywhere.Imagine that we were never getting anywhere, even before we came to this place.No matter where we move, we have never gotten anywhere.But that is so wrong.God, I hate your philosophy.Of course weve gotten somewhere.Weve come a long way, we have a long way to go.Oh please.Fuck you and your fortune cookies.Here we are now.Its too long.Too long  Think of it as an ostinato passage.Stubbornly repetitive.But then she fell silent, and then began to moanalmost a hum, a sound she was unaware that she made.Little miserable grunts.Someone crying.I dont want to talk, she said when he asked again.Shut up and let me be.Youre worthless to me.When things get tough, youre worthless.That night they reached another elevator station.She stuffed food in her as if sticking batteries in a machine.After that she muttered again, wandering in ways he couldnt follow.Possibly talking to her Pauline.On it went, a muttering in his ear.They performed their ablutions back down the tunnel without incident, and then lay down on their pads and tried to sleep.The muttering continued.After a while she whimpered herself to sleep.The next morning she wouldnt eat, or talk, or even move.She lay on her side in a catatonic fit, or a syncope, or simply paralysis.Pauline, can you talk?Wahram asked quietly, when Swan would say nothing.The slightly muffled voice from Swans neck said, Yes.Can you tell me about Swans vital signs?No, Swan said from nowhere.Vital signs available to me are nearly normal, except for blood sugar.You need to eat, Wahram said to Swan.She did not respond.He spooned some electrolyte water into her mouth, patiently waited for her to swallow.When she had taken in a few deciliters without drooling too much of it away, he said, Its noon up there.Up above us, on the surface, its noon.Middle of the brightside crossing.I think we need to take you up to have a look at the sun.Swan cracked an eyelid and looked up at him.We need to see it, he told her.She shoved her torso off the floor.Do you think?Is it possible?Wahram asked in reply.Yes, she said after thinking it over, it is.We can stay in the shade of the tracks.Its less bad at noon than in the morning or afternoon, because the photons come straight down and fewer hit your suit.We shouldnt stay out for long though.Thats all right.You need to see it, and nows the time.Noon on Mercury.Come on.He helped her up.He found their helmets and carried them into the elevator car, went back and picked up Swan, took her to the elevator.Up they went, and he got her helmet on and sealed it, checked her air, did the same for himself.The suits showed all was well.The elevator car came to a halt.Wahram felt his pulse pounding in his fingertips.The elevator door opened at the upper platform, and the world went white.Their faceplates adjusted, and a basic black and white sketch of a world appeared before them.To the left and slightly below were the citys tracks, glowing a deep incandescent white.To the right Mercurys noontime landscape extended to the horizon.In the absence of an atmosphere, there was only the land itself to take the blow of sunlight; it was glowing white hot.His helmets tint had shifted so hard that the stars were no longer visible in the sky.It was a white plane topped by a black hemisphere.The white was lightly pulsing.Swan walked out the door onto the platform.Hey!Wahram said, and went out after her.Get back in here!How would we see the sun in there?Come on, it will be all right for a while.The platform must be seven hundred K like everything else.Your boot soles are completely insulated at that temperature.Amazed, Wahram let her go.She tilted her head back to stare at the sun.Wahram couldnt help following her glancea stunning blastfearfully he looked down again.The afterimage was there to contemplate: a circle both white and red at the same time, giant in his vision.The dhalgren sun, real at last.Clearly his faceplate was filtered to an almost completely polarized black opacity, and yet the land was still white, etched with tiny black lines.Swan was still looking up.Dying of thirst, she now drowned in the torrent.Following her example, breaking out all over in a sweat, he glanced up again.The surface of the sun was a roiling mass of white tendrils.It bounced as if throwing off thermal waves; then he realized it was his heart bouncing him, bumping his body hard enough to make his vision jostle.Writhing white circle in a starless charcoal sky.White banners flowing over themselves everywhere in the circle, the movement suggestive of some vast living intelligence.A god, sure, why not?It looked like a god.Wahram dragged his gaze away and took her arm.Come on, Swan.Back inside now.Youve gotten your infusion.Wait just a second.Swan, dont do this.No, wait.Look down there by the track.She pointed.Somethings coming.And there was.Out of the east, on the smoothed ground just outside the outermost track, a small vehicle was approaching them.It stopped at the foot of the platform stairs, and a door in the side of the vehicle opened.A figure in a spacesuit appeared, looked up at them, waved them down.Could our sunwalkers have sent people out to get us?Wahram asked.I dont know, Swan said.Has there been enough time?I dont think so.They descended the stairs, Wahram holding Swan by the arm.She seemed pretty solid on her feet.Rejuvenated perhaps by the sight of the noon sun.Or the prospect of rescue.They got in the cars lock, and when it had closed on them, they were admitted to the interior, and in a sizeable compartment could take off their helmets and talk.Their rescuers were full of amazement.They had been making a brightside crossing at speed, they said, and had had no expectation whatsoever of seeing anyone standing on one of the platforms.And looking straight up at the sun, no less!How the hell did you people get there?What are you doing?Were from Terminator, Wahram explained.There are three more of us down there, a bit farther along to the east.Ah ha!But how did you Well, look, lets get going.You can tell it to us while we drive.Of course.Here, sit down by the window, then, take a look, its beautiful out there.The vehicle began to move.They passed by the station they had stood on.They were being rescued.Swan and Wahram stared at each other.Oh no!Swan said faintlyas if they had tripped into an unexpected disasteras if she were going to miss the second half of their walk.That made him smile.Lists (4)  sanguine,

corner coffee bar with a terrace or sidewalk, and there sip a big unsweetened Turkish coffee and read Passepartout as it displayed the latest news from around the system.After that Genette liked to continue walking in whatever city that morning happened to bring, eventually getting to work at the local Interplan office, invariably a small set of rooms near the government house.Interplan was unfortunately not a universally acknowledged police agency but rather something in the nature of a semiautonomous quasi governmental treaty monitor, so their work was often compromised, and Genette could sometimes feel like a private agent or an NGO gadfly; but they had good data.Genette liked to walk around in that data.The office was fine, colleagues stalwart, data important, but the walking itself was crucial.It was while walking that the inspector experienced the little visions and epiphanies that, when they came, constituted both the solution to the problem and the best moments in life.This could sometimes happen at the office, while looking at new stuff, or at things in the archives, to check a hypothesis that might have occurred over coffee.Their graphics rooms were always very powerful spaces of representation, with three dimensional and time lapsed virtual flows of real interest and beauty.Of course it was true that standing in clouds of colored dots and lines sometimes only added to ones confusion.But other times Genette would see things in the representations and then go back out in the world and notice things no one had noticed before, and that was very pleasing.That was the best part.Getting some consequent action out of the insights achieved was never quite as much fun.More often than the inspector would ever confess to any single person, it had been necessary to make deals in some poorly defined spaceanarchy, one might call it in a bad moodto bring certain findings to any kind of action in the world.But so far no crushing blame had rebounded on Interplans head, and in a business like theirs that was all one could ask for.As senior investigator, Genette could usually choose what cases to pursue, but of course the destruction of Terminator trumped all that kind of thing, commanding immediate attention from everywhere in the solar system.Also, since Terminator was part of the Mondragon, and Interplan was more closely associated with the Accord than with any other political entity, it was natural to get involved.Besides, there had never been a case quite like it.To have Mercurys only city torched (but there was a Phosphor being built, its tracks in the Mercurial north; have to look at that, wouldnt be the first time that real estate conflicts led to arson): naturally the whole solar system was transfixed.It was not clear what had happened, or how, or why, or by whom, and people loved this kind of thing, and were demanding answers.There would in fact be competing investigations into the incident.But the Lion of Mercury had been a good friend of the inspectors, and when the lion cubs had managed to regather after the evacuation, and assert Mercurial authority over the investigation, they had asked Genette to take charge.There was no question of declining such a request, which, it seemed, could also serve as a way to further the projects one had been pursuing with Alex and Wahram.Indeed the inspector felt that the destruction of Terminator so soon after the attack on Io, and the death of Alex, might be part of a pattern.The autopsy had confirmed that Alexs death had been the result of natural causes, but there remained a nagging ambiguity in Genettes mindfor some natural causes could be pushed to happen.It was while beginning the trip to Mercury, walking across the concourse of the spaceport to the gate for the ferry, enjoying the sight of people making their way to their gates with their usual unconscious skill, that the solution to the problem of the attack on Terminator all at once came to the inspector.The vivid image was like the single thing that remains caught from a dream, and it created any number of useful research lines to follow on the flight downsystem, but most of all a feeling of certainty that was very nice.It relieved what could have been quite a worry.By the time the inspector got to Mercury, the refugees from Terminator had either taken refuge in shelters or been dunkirked off planet.The death toll was at eighty three, most from health events or accidents with suits and locks, the usual emergency collection of mistakes and equipment failure and panic.Evacuations were notoriously one of the most dangerous of human activities, worse even than childbirth.Given that, and the fact that Terminator itself was still out there broiling on the brightside, the investigation was only just getting under way.It had been determined that the cameras for that stretch of track had been destroyed by the impact, along with a platform called Hammersmith, where it was feared a concert party had perished.On the other hand, Terminators orbital meteor defense system had provided its records for the relevant time, and neither radar, visual, nor infrared records showed any meteor prior to the hit.Satellite visuals of the impact showed no remains of an impactor.Attack from the fifth dimension!as people were saying.Genette, having seen the solution to this aspect of things, decided it was possible that pretending ignorance might allow time for the perpetrator to slip, and would also suppress copycat crimes.So the inspector said nothing about that, and remained in a room in the Rilke spaceport, interviewing witnesses.A big flash of light.Ah, thank you.Time to put in a heads up to Wang, perhaps, to run some feasibility studies on Genettes solution to the mystery.News came that two more refugees had been plucked off the brightside, and one of them turned out to be Alexs granddaughter, the artist Swan Er Hong.To be rescued out in the middle of the brightside seemed odd, and the inspector went to see them at the hospital in Schubert.Swan lay in a bed hooked up to a couple of IVs; very pale; apparently recovering from radiation sickness, caused by a coronal flare that had struck just before she and her companions had gotten underground.Genette climbed onto the chair next to her bed.Dark rings around red rimmed brown eyes.Wahram, having accompanied her in her trek in the utilidor system, was sitting on the other side of the bed.Apparently he had not gotten as sick.He did look quite weary.Swan registered Genettes presence beside her.You again, she said.What the fuck.She glared at Wahram, who blanched a little to see it, even raised a hand to ward off her gaze.What are you two up to?she demanded.Genette turned on Passepartout, a qube like an old wristwatch, and said, Please dont be upset.I am inspector general of the Interplanetary Police, as I told you when we met before.I was worried to learn of Alexs unexpected death, and although that appears to have been a natural event, I have been continuing to look into a number of untoward events that may be connected.You were close to Alex, and you were there to witness the assault on Io, and now you were here again when Terminator was attacked.It may be a coincidence, but you can see why we continue to run into each other.Swan nodded unhappily.Wahram said, Did you ever find out anything out about the remains of the figure that fell into the lava on Io?Lets discuss that later, Genette said with a warning look at Wahram.For now we need to focus on the destruction of Terminator.Do you two mind telling me what you saw?Swan sat up and described the strike, then their return to the city, and their realization that they had missed the evacuation; then their run east to the nearest track platform, and their descent into the utilidor.Wahram merely nodded in confirmation from time to time.This took a few minutes.After that Swans account of their time in the utilidor was very brief, and Wahram did not elaborate or nod at anything.Twenty four days could be a long time.Genette looked back and forth between them.Neither of them had seen much at the time of the blast, it was clear.So is Terminator still burning?Swan said.Strictly speaking, the burning is done.It is now incandescing.She turned away, face scrunched in a knot.In their final transmissions, the cameras and AIs left behind in Terminator had recorded the city igniting in the sunlightburning, melting, exploding, and so forth, until the recording instruments had failed.It had not been a general inferno but rather a patchwork of smaller fires, starting at different times.Some heat resistant AIs were still transmitting data, documenting what happened as everything heated to seven hundred K.  A collage of all those images gave a good impression of the incineration, though it seemed pretty clear that Swan would not want to see it.But in fact she did.When she composed herself, she declared, I want to see it all.Show me everything.I need to see it.I intend to make a penance somehow, a memorial.For now, tell us what you know!What happened?The inspector shrugged.The citys tracks were impacted by something.The site itself is still out on the brightside, and until sunset arrives a thorough investigation cant be made.The impactor was invisible to your meteor defense systems, which should not be possible, as it massed many thousands of kilograms.Some people are saying it must have been a comet strike.I prefer to call it the event.It still isnt established for sure that it wasnt an explosion from below.Like a mine planted under it?Wahram asked.Well, some satellite photos do make it look more like an impact event.But then questions arise.The inspectors wristqube spoke in a clear singsong: Youve got a visitor named Mqaret.Tell him where we are, Genette said to it.Ask him to join us.Swans cheeks had turned hectic.I want to see Terminator, she announced.It might be possible to visit briefly in a protected vehicle, but little can be done there now.The crews on site are mostly taking shelter in the shade of it.Sunset reaches that longitude in about seventeen more days.Then Mqaret came into the room, and Swan cried out his name and reached out for a hug.We thought you were dead!Mqaret exclaimed.That whole concert party disappeared, and we thought you were with them, and then the evacuation was chaos, and we thought you were killed.We got down into the utilidor, Swan said.Well, people checked down there, but they didnt see anyone.We decided to hike east, to get it over with faster.I can see how you would do that, but you should have left a note.I thought we did.Really?But never mindyoure so thin!We need to get you to the lab to have a really thorough look at you.Mqaret circled the bed and gave Wahram a brief hug too.Thank you for getting my Swan home.We hear you took care of her down there.Genette saw that Swan did not look entirely happy at this description.Wahram said, We all helped each other.Indeed we look forward to seeing the young sunwalkers we were down there with.Mqaret said, Theyre in the process of retrieving them now, and I hope theyll be fine.A fair number of sunwalkers have been picked up.Ours were very helpful, Wahram said, although Swan snorted to hear it.Mqaret seemed unaffected by the destruction of the city; as it came on the heels of Alexs death, he no doubt felt that it didnt really matter.With Terminator gone, however, the Mercurials were now reduced to staying in underground shelters scattered all over the planet, in a way not that different from how people occupied Io.Which was not the optimal position from which to rebuild.But they could do it, and in fact work had already started, using heat resistant shelters and robots.Very soon after sunset came to the burned city, they would fix the tracks and have the citys frame moving again; then they could rebuild in the safety of darkness, as they had the first time.Meanwhile they were still in emergency mode, and their influence elsewhere in the system correspondingly reduced.So now Mqaret said to Swan, but with a look to Genette and Wahram, Well rebuild and well be all right.The people who talk about our fatal criticality have different criticalities of their own.Were all vulnerable in space.There isnt a single off Earth settlement that couldnt be destroyed, except for Mars.Which is part of what makes Mars insufferable, Genette noted.I will create a monument to our loss, Swan declared, struggling as if to leave her bed.Tugging dramatically at her IV linesI will perform an abramovic in the ruins, to express the citys grief.Perhaps a period of crucifixion would be appropriate.Burning at the stake, Wahram suggested.Swan shot him a poisonous look.Mqaret objected more tactfully, pointing out that Swan was not yet recovered enough to use her body as a canvas.Its always so hard on you, Swan, you cant.I will!I most certainly will.But Swans qube spoke from the right side of her neck: I must inform you that you have given me instructions to oppose any abramovician artworks when your health is not optimal.These are your own instructions to yourself.Ridiculous, Swan said.Sometimes circumstances demand a change in plan.This is an overriding life event, a catastrophe.It demands a response in kind.I must inform you that you have given me instructions to oppose doing an abramovic when your health is not optimal.Shut up, Pauline.I dont want you to speak now.Mqaret had moved to block Swan from leaving her bed; now he said, Dear Swan, your Pauline is right.Meaning that you yourself are right, and speaking from a larger perspective in yourself.Dont be hasty here.There are better ways for you to exert yourself during our time of troubles.Theres work to be done.Its work to express Terminators fate in art.I know, and for you especially.But you are one of our biome designers, and so youll be very much needed in that capacity.We can seize this opportunity to renovate the park and the farm.Swan looked alarmed.Surely well just replace them?No one will want anything changedI know I wont.Well, well see about that.But you must be available to the city.Swan glowered.I will be no matter what.Can we at least take a hopper around into the brightside and look at it?I think so.Ill ask for seats on one of the daytrippers as soon as I can.But you need to finish your recovery first.A few days later they all went out in a hopper, following the tracks east into daylight and the wreckage of Terminator.The land below as seen through heavy filtering was the white of paper, marked by black rings and a few wavering lines, resembling all together some alphabet written with compasses.The tracks themselves were a narrow band of glowing white wires.Then over the horizon reared Terminator.The dome frame glowed as white as the tracks.The interior was a black mass, which as they got closer resolved to smaller masses of clinkers and gunk and ash, black blobs, black powder.Some metal surfaces glowed red.It was reminiscent of old photos of Terran cities destroyed by firestorm.Mqaret shook his head at the sight.You can see why we need to stay on the nightside.Swan stared down, seeming not to hear.No theatrics this time, Genette noted.Grim desolation in an empty face.Looked like she was somewhere else.Wahram was watching her unobtrusively.The glowing ruin of the city was dominated by the still standing Dawn Wall.Its east facing exterior was as silvery and pure as ever, but its inside was now a mess of curving black terraces.Some of the rooftops made of royal blue ceramic tiles had remained intact, and even now held their color.The Great Staircase still cut down through black strip after black strip, the imported marble of the steps nacreous in the heat.The glowing white spans of the dome frame curved up at the sky like the framework of the dome in Hiroshima.It was so beautiful, Mqaret said.Still is, said Swan.Mqaret said, Well import some mature trees and grow the rest from seed.Although I have to tell you, the arrangements with insurance dont seem to be working out very well.Theyre arguing about the definition of full replacement.Also it isnt clear yet whether it was an act of God or an act of war.The council lawyers think the insurance is there for us either way, but who knows.Its going to be expensive, thats the main thing.Well need help.Luckily the Accord will have our back.And replacing the animals will be easy, as the terraria are well above capacity.He glanced at Wahram, cleared his throat.I hear the Vulcanoids are also anxious to help.Naturally theyre worried down there.
