Door didnt move.He had to get past it.Naomi wasnt going to like this.With his one free hand, Miller loosened the woven metal strap around the bomb until it could rock back and forth a little.Carefully, slowly, he lifted the corner of it.Then, watching the status readouts, he wedged the hand terminal under it, the metal corner digging hard into the touch screen over the enter button.The trigger stayed green.If the station shook or shifted, hed still have five seconds to get to it.Good enough.Braced with both hands, Miller tugged at the doors.More of the black crust fell away as he levered the doors open far enough to see through.The corridor beyond was nearly round; the dark growth had filled in the corners until the passage looked like a huge desiccated blood vessel.The only lights were his suits headlights and a million tiny luminescent dots that swirled in the air like blue fireflies.When the Eros feed pulsed, growing momentarily louder, the fireflies dimmed and then returned.The environment suit reported breathable air with higher than expected concentrations of argon, ozone, and benzene.One of the luminescent dots floated past him, swirling on currents he couldnt feel.Miller ignored it, pushing at the doors, widening the gap centimeter by centimeter.He could put in an arm to feel the crust.It seemed solid enough to support the cart.That was a godsend.If it had been thigh high alien mud, he would have had to find some other way to carry the bomb.It was going to be bad enough hauling the cart up to the rounded surface.No rest for the wicked, Julie Mao said in his mind.No peace for the good.He went back to work.By the time hed shoved the doors wide enough to get through, he was sweating.His arms and back ached.The dark crust had started growing down the corridor, tendrils shooting out toward the airlock, keeping to the edges, where walls met floor or ceiling.The blue glow had colonized the air.Eros was heading out the corridor as quickly as he was heading in.Faster, maybe.Miller hauled the cart up with both hands, watching the hand terminal closely.The bomb rocked, but not so much it lost its grip on the trigger.Once he was safely in the corridor, he took the terminal back.One.Two.The heavy bomb casing had carved a little divot in the touch pad, but it still worked.Miller took the cart handle and leaned forward, the uneven, organic surface beneath him translated into the rough tug and flutter of the carts vibration.Hed died here once.Hed been poisoned.Shot.These halls, or ones much like them, had been his battleground.His and Holdens.They were unrecognizable now.He passed through a wide, nearly empty space.The crust had thinned here, the metal walls of the warehouse showing through in places.One LED still glowed in the ceiling, the cool white light spilling onto the darkness.The path led him to the casino level, the architecture of commerce still bringing visitors to the same spot.The alien bark was nearly gone, but the space had been transformed.Pachinko machines stood in their rows, half melted or exploded or, like a few, still glittering and asking for the financial information that would unlock the gaudy lights and festive, celebratory sound effects.The card tables were still visible under mushroom caps of clear glutinous gel.Lining the walls and cathedral high ceilings, black ribs rippled with hairlike threads that glowed at the tips without offering any illumination.Something screamed, the sound muffled by Millers suit.The broadcast feed of the station sounded louder and richer now that he was under its skin.He had the sudden, transporting memory of being a child and watching a video feed of a boy whod been swallowed by a monstrous whale.Something gray and the size of Millers two fists together flew by almost too fast to see.It hadnt been a bird.Something scuttled behind an overturned vending machine.He realized what was missing.There had been a million and a half people on Eros, and a large percentage of them had been here, on the casino level, when their own personal apocalypse came.But there were no bodies.Or, no.That wasnt true.The black crust, the millions of dark rills above him with their soft, oceanic glow.Those were the corpses of Eros, recreated.Human flesh, remade.A suit alarm told him he was starting to hyperventilate.Darkness started to creep in at the edge of his vision.Miller sank to his knees.Dont pass out, you son of a bitch, he told himself.Dont pass out, or if you do, at least land so your weights on the damned trigger.Julie put her hand on his.He could almost feel it, and it steadied him.She was right.They were only bodies.Just dead people.Victims.Just another slab of recycled meat, same as every unlicensed whore hed seen stabbed to death in the cheap hotels on Ceres.Same as all the suicides whod thrown themselves out of airlocks.Okay, the protomolecule had mutilated the flesh in weird ways.Didnt change what it was.Didnt change what he was.When youre a cop, he told Julie, repeating something hed told every rookie hed been partnered with in his career, you dont have the luxury of feeling things.You have to do the job.So do the job, she said gently.He nodded.He stood.Do the job.As if in response, the sound in his suit changed, the Eros feed fluting up through a hundred different frequencies before exploding in a harsh flood of what he thought was Hindi.Human voices.Till human voices wake us, he thought, without quite being able to recall where the phrase came from.Somewhere in the station, there was going to be something.A control mechanism or a power supply or whatever the protomolecule was using instead of an engine.He didnt know what it would look like or how it would be defended.He didnt have any idea how it worked, apart from the assumption that if he blew it up, it wouldnt keep going very well.So we go back, he told Julie.We go back to what we do know.The thing that was growing inside Eros, using the stone skin of the asteroid as its own unarticulated exoskeleton, hadnt cut off the ports.It hadnt moved the interior walls or recreated the chambers and passages of the casino level.So the stations layout should be pretty near what it had always been.Okay.Whatever it used to drive the station through space, it was using a shitload of energy.Okay.So find the hot spot.With his free hand, he checked the environment suit.Ambient temperature was twenty seven degrees: hot but far from unbearable.He walked briskly back toward the port corridor.The temperature dropped by less than a hundredth of a degree, but it did drop.All right, then.He could go to each of the corridors, find which one was hottest, and follow it.When he found a place in the station that was, say, three or four degrees hotter than the rest, that would be the place.Hed roll the cart up beside it, let up his thumb, and count to five.No problem.When he got back to the cart, something golden with the soft look of heather was growing around the wheels.Miller scraped it off as best he could, but one of the wheels had still developed a squeak.Nothing to be done about that.With one hand hauling the cart and the other mashing down on his hand terminals dead mans switch, Miller headed up, deeper into the station.* * *   Shes mine, mindless Eros said.It had been stuck on the phrase for the better part of an hour.Shes mine.Shes mine.Fine, Miller muttered.You can have her.His shoulder ached.The squeak in the carts wheel had grown worse, the whine of it cutting through the souls of the damned madness of the Eros feed.His thumb was starting to tingle from the constant, relentless pressure of not annihilating himself quite yet.With each level he rose, the spin gravity grew lighter and the Coriolis a little more noticeable.It wasnt quite the same as on Ceres, but it was close and felt like coming home.He found himself looking forward to when the job was done.He imagined himself back in his hole, a six pack of beer, some music on the speakers that had an actual composer instead of the wild, empty minded glossolalia of the dead station.Maybe some light jazz.Who ever thought the idea of light jazz would be appealing?Catch me if you can, cocksuckers, Eros said.I am gone and gone and gone.Gone and gone and gone.The inner levels of the station were both more familiar and stranger.Away from the mass grave of the casino level, more of Eros old life showed through.Tube stops still glowed, announcing line errors and counseling patience.Air recyclers hummed.The floors were relatively clean and clear.The sense of near normalcy made the changes stand out eerily.Dark fronds coated the walls with swirling nautilus patterns.Flakes of the stuff drifted down from above, whirling in the spin gravity like soot.Eros still had spin gravity but didnt have gravity from the massive acceleration it was under.Miller chose not to try to figure that out.A flock of softball sized spiderlike things crawled through the corridor, leaving a slick sheen of glowing slime behind them.It wasnt until he paused to knock one off the cart that he recognized them as severed hands, the trailing wrist bones charred black and remade.Part of his mind was screaming, but it was a distant one and easy to ignore.He had to respect the protomolecule.For something that had been expecting prokaryotic anaerobes, it was doing a bang up job of making do.He paused to check his suits sensor array.The temperature had risen half a degree since hed left the casino and a tenth of a degree since hed entered this particular main hall.The background radiation was also climbing, his poor abused flesh sucking in more rads.The concentration of benzene was going down, and his suit was picking up more exotic aromatic molecules tetracene, anthracene, naphthalene with behavior sufficiently strange to confuse the sensors.So it was the right direction.He leaned forward, the cart resisting his pull like a bored kid.As he recalled, the structural layout was roughly like Ceres, and he knew Ceres like he knew his name.One more level up maybe two there would be a confluence of services from the lower, high g levels and the supply and energy systems that did better at lower gravity.It seemed as likely a place to grow a command and control center as any.As good a location for a brain.Gone and gone and gone, Eros said.And gone.It was funny, he thought, how the ruins of the past shaped everything that came after.It seemed to work on all levels; one of the truths of the universe.Back in the ancient days, when humanity still lived entirely down a well, the paths laid down by Roman legions had become asphalt and later ferroconcrete without ever changing a curve or a turn.On Ceres, Eros, Tycho, the bore of the standard corridor had been determined by mining tools built to accommodate the trucks and lifts of Earth, which had in turn been designed to go down tracks wide enough for a mule carts axle.And now the alien the thing from out in the vast dark was growing along the corridors, ducts, tube routes, and water pipes laid out by a handful of ambitious primates.He wondered what it would have been like if the protomolecule hadnt been captured by Saturn, had actually found its way into the soup of primordial Earth.No fusion reactors, no navigation drives, no complex flesh to appropriate.What would it have done differently if it hadnt had to build around some other evolutions design choices?Miller, Julie said.Keep moving.He blinked.He was standing in the empty passageway at the base of an access ramp.He didnt know how long hed been lost in his own mind.Years, maybe.He blew out a long breath and started up the ramp.The corridors above him were reading as considerably hotter than ambient.Almost three degrees.He was getting close.There was no light, though.He took his tingling, half numbed thumb off the select button, turned on the hand terminals little utility LED, and got back to the dead mans switch just before the count of four.Gone and gone and and and and and and.The Eros feed squealed, a chorus of voices chattering in Russian and Hindi clamoring over the old singular voice and being drowned out in turn by a deep creaking howl.Whale song, maybe.Millers suit mentioned politely that he had half an hour of oxygen left.He shut the alarm down.The transfer station was overgrown.Pale fronds swarmed along the corridors and twisted into ropes.Recognizable insects flies, cockroaches, water spiders crawled along the thick white cables in purposeful waves.Tendrils of something that looked like articulated bile swept back and forth, leaving a film of scurrying larvae.They were as much victim of the protomolecule as the human population.Poor bastards.You cant take the razor back, Eros said, and its voice sounded almost triumphant.You cant take the razor back.She is gone and gone and gone.The temperature was climbing faster now.It took him a few minutes to decide that spinward might be slightly warmer.He hauled the cart.He could feel the squeaking, a tiny, rattling tremor in the bones of his hand.Between the mass of the bomb and the failing wheel bearings, his shoulders were starting to really ache.Good thing he wasnt going to have to haul this damn thing back down.Julie was waiting for him in the darkness; the thin beam from his hand terminal cut through her.Her hair floated, spin gravity having, after all, no effect on phantoms of the mind.Her expression was grave.How does it know?she asked.Miller paused.Every now and then, all through his career, some daydreamed witness would say something, use some phrase, laugh at the wrong thing, and hed know that the back of his mind had a new angle on the case.This was that moment.You cant take the razor back, Eros crowed.The comet that took the protomolecule into the solar system in the first place was a dead drop, not a ship, Julie said, her dark lips never moving.It was just ballistic.Any ice bullet with the protomolecule in deep freeze.It was aimed at Earth, but it missed and got grabbed by Saturn instead.The payload didnt steer it.Didnt drive it.Didnt navigate.It didnt need to, Miller said.Its navigating now.Its going to Earth.How does it know to go to Earth?Where did that information come from?Its talking.Where did that grammar come from?Who is the voice of Eros?Miller closed his eyes.His suit mentioned that he only had twenty minutes of air.You cant take the Razorback!She is gone and gone and gone!Oh fuck, Miller said.Oh Jesus.He let go of the cart, turning back toward the ramp and the light and the wide station corridors.Everything was shaking, the station itself trembling like someone on the edge of hypothermia.Only of course it wasnt.The only one shaking was him.It was all in the voice of Eros.It had been there all the time.He should have known.Maybe he had.The protomolecule didnt know English or Hindi or Russian or any of the languages it had been spouting.All of that had been in the minds and softwares of Eros dead, coded in the neurons and grammar programs that the protomolecule had eaten.Eaten, but not destroyed.It had kept the information and languages and complex cognitive structures, building itself on them like asphalt over the roads the legions built.The dead of Eros werent dead.Juliette Andromeda Mao was alive.He was grinning so hard his cheeks ached.With one gloved hand, he tried the connection.The signal was too weak.He couldnt get through.He told his uplink on the surface ship to crank up the power, got a connection.Holdens voice came over the link.Hey.Miller.How you doing?The words were soft, apologetic.A hospice worker being gentle to the dying.An incandescent spark of annoyance lit his mind, but he kept his voice steady.Holden, he said.We have a problem.Actually, weve sort of figured out how to solve the problem, Holden replied.I dont think so.Im linking you to my suits med data, Miller said.A few seconds later, four columns of numbers popped up in a small window on Holdens console.It all looked fairly normal, though there were subtleties that only a med tech, like Shed, would be able to interpret correctly.Okay, Holden said.Thats great.Youre getting a little irradiated, but other than that   Miller cut him off.Am I suffering from hypoxia?he said.The data from his suit showed 87 mmHg, comfortably above baseline.No, Holden said.Anything that would make a guy hallucinate or get demented?Alcohol, opiates.Something like that?Not that I can see, Holden said, growing impatient.Whats this about?Are you seeing things?Just the usual, Miller replied.I wanted to get that shit out the way, because I know what youre going to say next.He stopped talking, and the radio hissed and popped in Holdens ear.When Miller spoke again after several seconds of silence, his voice had taken on a different tone.It wasnt quite pleading, but close enough to make Holden shift uncomfortably in his seat.Shes alive.There was only one she in Millers universe.Julie Mao.Uh, okay.Not sure how to respond to that.Youll have to take my word that Im not having a nervous breakdown or psychotic episode or anything like that.But Julies in here.Shes driving Eros.Holden looked at the suits medical data again, but it kept reporting normal readings, all the numbers except for radiation comfortably in the green.His blood chemistry didnt even look like he was particularly stressed for a guy carrying a fusion bomb to his own funeral.Miller, Julies dead.We both saw the body.We saw what the protomolecule did to it.We saw her body, sure.We just assumed she was dead because of the damage   She didnt have a heartbeat, Holden said.No brain activity, no metabolism.Thats pretty much the definition of dead.How do we know what dead looks like to the protomolecule?We  Holden started, then stopped.We dont, I guess.But no heartbeat, thats a pretty good start.Miller laughed.Weve both seen the feeds, Holden.Those rib cages equipped with one arm that drag themselves around, think they have a heartbeat?This shit hasnt been playing by our rules since day one, you expect it to start now?Holden smiled to himself.Miller was right.Okay, so what makes you think Julie isnt just a rib cage and a mass of tentacles?She might be, but its not her body Im talking about, Miller said.Shes in here.Her mind.Its like shes flying her old racing pinnace.The Razorback.Shes been babbling about it on the radio for hours now, and I just didnt put it together.But now that I have, its pretty goddamn clear.Why is she headed toward Earth?I dont know, Miller said.He sounded excited, interested.More alive than Holden had ever heard him.Maybe the protomolecule wants to get there and its messing with her.Julie wasnt the first person to get infected, but shes the first one that survived long enough to get somewhere.Maybe shes the seed crystal and everything that the protomolecules doing is built on her.I dont know that, but I can find out.I just need to find her.Talk to her.You need to get that bomb to wherever the controls are and set it off.I cant do that, Miller said.Because of course he couldnt.It doesnt matter, Holden thought.In a little less than thirty hours, youre both radioactive dust.All right.Can you find your girl in less than Holden had the Roci do a revised time of impact for the incoming missiles twenty seven hours?Why?What happens in twenty seven hours?Earth fired her entire interplanetary nuclear arsenal at Eros a few hours ago.We just turned the transponders on in the five freighters you parked on the surface.The missiles are targeting them.The Roci is guessing twenty seven hours to impact based on the current acceleration curve.The Martian and UN navies are on their way to sterilize the area after detonation.Make sure nothing survives or slips the net.Jesus.Yeah, Holden said with a sigh.Im sorry I didnt tell you sooner.Ive had a lot going on, and it sort of slipped my mind.There was another long silence on the line.You can stop them, Miller said.Shut down the transponders.Holden spun his chair around to face Naomi.Her face had the same what did he just say?look that he knew was on his own.She pulled the suits medical data over to her console, then called up the Rocis medical expert system and began running a full medical diagnostic.The implication was clear.She thought something was wrong with Miller that wasnt immediately apparent from the data they were getting.If the protomolecule had infected him, used him as a last ditch misdirection  Not a chance, Miller.This is our last shot.If we blow this one, Eros can orbit the Earth, spraying brown goo all over it.No way we take that risk.Look, Miller said, his tone alternating between the earlier pleading and a growing frustration.Julie is in here.If I can find her, a way to talk to her, I can stop this without the nukes.What, ask the protomolecule to pretty please not infect the Earth, when that was what it was designed to do?Appeal to its better nature?Miller paused for a moment before speaking again.Look, Holden, I think I know whats going on here.This thing was intended to infect single celled organisms.The most basic forms of life, right?Holden shrugged, then remembered there was no video feed and said, Okay.That didnt work, but its a smart bastard.Adaptive.It got into a human host, a complex multicelled organism.Aerobic.Huge brain.Nothing like what it was built for.Its been improvising ever since.That mess on the stealth ship?That was its first try.We saw what it was doing with Julie in that Eros bathroom.It was learning how to work with us.Where are you going with this?Holden said.There was no time pressure yet, with the missiles still more than a day away, but he couldnt quite keep the impatience out of his voice.All Im saying is Eros now isnt what the protomolecules designers planned on.Its their original plan laid over the top of billions of years of our evolution.And when you improvise, you use what youve got.You use what works.Julies the template.Her brain, her emotions are all over this thing.She sees this run to Earth as a race, and shes crowing about winning.Laughing at you because you cant keep up.Wait, Holden said.Shes not attacking Earth, shes going home.For all we know, shes not heading for Earth at all.Luna, maybe.She grew up there.The protomolecule piggybacked on her structure, her brain.And so she infected it as much as it infected her.If I can make her understand whats really going on, then maybe I can negotiate with her.How do you know that?Call it a hunch, Miller said.Im good with hunches.Holden whistled, the entire situation doing a flip flop in his head.The new perspective was dizzying.But the protomolecule still wants to obey its program, Holden said.And we have no idea what that is.I can damn sure tell you it isnt wiping humans out.The things that shot Phoebe at us two billion years ago didnt know what the hell humans were.Whatever it wants to do needed biomass, and its got that now.Holden couldnt stop himself from snorting at that.So, what?They dont mean us any harm?Seriously?You think if we explain that wed rather not have it land on Earth, then it will just agree and go somewhere else?Not it, Miller said.Her.Naomi looked up at Holden, shaking her head.She wasnt seeing anything organic wrong with Miller either.Ive been working this case for, shit, almost a year, Miller said.Ive climbed into her life, read her mail, met her friends.I know her.Shes about as independent as a person can be, and she loves us.Us?Holden asked.People.She loves humans.She gave up being the little rich girl and joined the OPA.She backed the Belt because it was the right thing to do.No way she kills us if she knows thats whats happening.I just need to find a way to explain.I can do this.Give me a chance.Holden ran a hand through his hair, grimacing at the accumulating grease.A day or two at high g was not conducive to regular showering.Cant do it, Holden said.Stakes are too high.Were going ahead with the plan.Im sorry.Shell beat you, Miller said.What?Okay, maybe she wont.Youve got a shitload of firepower.But the protomolecules figured out how to get around inertia.And Julie?Shes a fighter, Holden.If you take her on, my moneys on her.Holden had seen the video of Julie fighting off her attackers on board the stealth ship.Shed been methodical and ruthless in her own defense.Shed fought without giving quarter.Hed seen the wildness in her eyes when she felt trapped and threatened.Only her attackers combat armor had kept her from doing a lot more damage before they took her down.Holden felt the hair on the back of his neck stand up at the idea of Eros actually fighting.So far it had been content to run from their clumsy attacks.What happened when it went to war?You could find her, Holden said, and use the bomb.If I cant get through to her, Miller said, thats my deal.Ill find her.Ill talk to her.If I cant get through, Ill take her out, and you can turn Eros into a cinder.Im fine with that.But you have to give me time to try it my way first.Holden looked at Naomi looking back at him.Her face was pale.He wanted to see the answer in her expression, to know what he should do based on what she thought.He didnt.It was his call.Do you need more than twenty seven hours?Holden finally asked.He heard Miller exhale loudly.There was gratitude in his voice that was, in its own way, worse than the pleading had been.I dont know.There are a couple thousand kilometers of tunnels down here, and none of the transit systems work.I have to walk everywhere pulling this damn wagon.Not to mention the fact that I dont really know what Im even looking for.But give me a little time, Ill figure it.And you know that if this doesnt work, youll have to kill her.Yourself and Julie?I know.Holden had the Roci calculate how long it would take Eros to reach the Earth at the current rate of acceleration.The missiles from Earth were covering the distance a lot faster than Eros was.The IPBMs were just overpowered Epstein drives with nuclear bombs riding up front.Their acceleration limits were the functional limits of the Epstein drive itself.If the missiles didnt arrive, it would still take nearly a week for Eros to get to Earth, even if it kept a constant rate of acceleration.There was some flexibility in there.Hold on, let me work something out here, Holden said to Miller, then muted the connection.Naomi, the missiles are flying in a straight line toward Eros, and the Roci thinks theyll intercept it in about twenty seven hours, give or take.How much time do we buy if we turn that straight line into a curve?How much of a curve can we do and still give the missiles a chance to catch Eros before it gets too close?Naomi tipped her head to one side, looking at him suspiciously through narrowed eyes.What are you about to do?she said.Maybe give Miller a chance to head off the first interspecies war.You trust Miller?she said with surprising vehemence.You think hes insane.You threw him off the ship because you thought he was a psychopath and a killer, and now youre going to let him speak for humanity to an alien God thing that wants to rip us to shreds?Holden had to suppress a smile.Telling an angry woman was how attractive her anger made her would make it stop being cute very quickly.And besides that, he needed it to make sense to her.That was how hed know if he was right.You told me once that Miller was right, even when I thought he was wrong.I didnt make it a blanket statement, Naomi said, spacing her words out like she was speaking to an idiot child.I said he was right to shoot Dresden.That doesnt mean Millers stable.Hes in the process of committing suicide, Jim.Hes fixated on this dead girl.I cant even begin to imagine what might be going through his head right now.Agreed.But hes there, on the scene, and hes got a keen eye for observation and just plain figuring shit out.This guy tracked us to Eros based on the ship name we picked.Thats pretty damned impressive.Hed never even met me, and he knew me well enough from researching me to know Id like naming my ship after Don Quixotes horse.Naomi laughed.Really?Is that where that comes from?So when he says that he knows Julie, I believe him.Naomi started to say something, then paused.You think shell beat the nukes?Naomi said, more softly.He thinks she can.And he thinks he can talk her into not killing us all.I have to give him that chance.I owe it to him.Even if it means killing Earth?No, Holden said.Not that much.Naomi paused again.Her anger faded.So delay the impact, not abort, Naomi said.Buy him some time.How much can we get?Naomi frowned, looking at the readouts.He could almost see the options clicking through her mind.She smiled, her fierceness gone now, replaced by the mischievous look she got when she knew she was being really clever.As much as you want.* * *   You want to do what?Fred asked.Pull the nukes off course for a while to buy Miller some time, but not so much that we cant still use them to destroy Eros if we need to, Holden said.Its simple, Naomi added.Im sending you detailed instructions.Give me the overview, Fred said.Earth has targeted their missiles on the five freighter transponders on Eros, Naomi said, pulling her plan up as an overlay on the comm video.You have ships and stations all over the Belt.You use the transponder reconfiguring program you gave us way back when, and you keep shifting those transponder codes to ships or stations along these vectors to pull the missiles into a long arc that eventually wraps back around to Eros.Fred shook his head.Wont work.The minute UNN Command sees were doing it, theyll just tell the missiles to stop following those particular codes, and theyll try to figure out some other way to target Eros, he said.And theyll also be really pissed at us.Yeah, theyre going to be pissed all right, Holden said.But theyre not going to get their missiles back.Just before you start leading the missiles off course, were going to launch a massive hacking attempt from multiple locations on the missiles.So theyll assume an enemy is trying to trick them, and shut down mid flight reprogramming, Fred said.Yep, Holden replied.Well tell them were going to trick them so they stop listening, and once theyre not listening, well trick them.Fred shook his head again, this time giving Holden the vaguely frightened look of a man who wanted to back slowly out of the room.There is no way in hell I am going along with this, he said.Miller isnt going to work some magical deal with the aliens.Were going to wind up nuking Eros no matter what.Why delay the inevitable?Because, Holden said.Im starting to think it might be less dangerous this way.If we use the missiles without taking out Eros command center brain whatever, we dont know if itll work, but Im pretty sure our chances go down.Millers the only one who can do that.And these are his terms.Fred said something obscene.If Miller doesnt manage to talk to it, hell take it out.I do trust him for that, Holden said.Come on, Fred, you know these missile designs as well as I do.Better.They put enough fuel pellets in those drives to fly around the solar system twice.We arent losing anything by giving Miller a little more time.Fred shook his head a third time.Holden saw his face go hard.He wasnt going to buy it.Before he could say no, Holden said, Remember that box with the protomolecule samples, and all the lab notes?Want to know what my price is for it?You, Fred said slowly, drawing it out, are out of your God damn mind.Want to buy it or what?Holden replied.You want the magic ticket to a seat at the table?You know my price now.Give Miller his chance, and the samples yours.* * *   Id be curious to know how you talked them into it, Miller said.I was thinking I was probably screwed.Doesnt matter, Holden said.We bought you your time.Go find the girl and save humanity.Well be waiting to hear back.And ready to nuke you into dust if we dont remained unsaid.There was no need.Ive been thinking about where to go, if I can talk to her, Miller said.He had the already lost hopefulness of a man with a lottery ticket.I mean, shes got to park this thing somewhere.If we live.If I can save her.If the miracle is true.Holden shrugged, even though no one could see it.Give her Venus, he said.Its an awful place.I dont and I dont, the voice of Eros muttered.Juliette Mao, talking in her sleep.I dont and I dont and I dont   Come on, Miller said.Come on, you sonofabitch.Be here.The medical bays were lush and overgrown, black spirals with filaments of bronze and steel climbing the walls, encrusting the examination tables, feeding on the supplies of narcotics, steroids, and antibiotics spilling out of the broken supply cabinets.Miller dug through the clutter with one hand, his suit alarm chiming.His air had the sour taste that came from being through the recyclers too many times.His thumb, still mashed on the dead mans switch, tingled when it wasnt shooting with pain.He brushed the almost fungal growth off a storage box that wasnt broken yet, found the latch.Four medical gas cylinders: two red, one green, one blue.He looked at the seal.The protomolecule hadnt gotten them yet.Red for anesthetic.Blue nitrogen.He picked up the green.The sterile shield on the delivery nipple was in place.He took a deep sighing breath of dying air.Another few hours.He put down his hand terminal (one two), popped the seal (three), fed the nipple into his suits intake (four), and put a finger on the hand terminal.He stood, feeling the cool of the oxygen tank in his hand while his suit revised his life span.Ten minutes, an hour, four hours.The medical cylinders pressure hit equality with the suits, and he popped it off.Four more hours.Hed won himself four more hours.It was the third time hed managed an emergency resupply since hed talked to Holden.The first had been at a fire suppression station, the second at a backup recycling unit.If he went back down to the port, there would probably be some uncompromised oxygen in some of the supply closets and docked ships.If he went all the way back to the surface, the OPA ships would have plenty.But there wasnt time for that.He wasnt looking for air; he was looking for Juliette.He let himself stretch.The kinks in his neck and back were threatening to turn into cramps.The CO2 levels in the suit were still on the high side of acceptable, even with the new oxygen coming into the mix.The suit needed maintenance and a new filter.Itd have to wait.Behind him, the bomb in its cart kept its own counsel.He had to find her.Somewhere in the maze of corridors and rooms, the dead city, Juliette Mao was driving them back to Earth.Hed tracked four hot spots.Three had been decent candidates for his original plan of vast nuclear immolation: hubs of wire and black alien filament tangling into huge organic looking nodes.The fourth had been a cheap lab reactor churning on its way to meltdown.It had taken him fifteen minutes to get the emergency shutdown going, and he probably shouldnt have wasted the time.But wherever he went, no Julie.Even the Julie of his imagination was gone, as if the ghost had no place now that he knew the real woman was still alive.He missed having her around, even if shed only been a vision.A wave went through the medical bays, all the alien growth rising and falling like iron filings with a magnet passed beneath them.Millers heart sped up, adrenaline leaking into his blood, but it didnt happen again.He had to find her.He had to find her soon.He could feel exhaustion grinding at him, little teeth chewing at the back of his mind.He already wasnt thinking as clearly as he should.Back on Ceres, hed have gone back to his hole, slept for a day, and come back to the problem whole.Not an option here.Full circle.Hed come full circle.Once, in a different life, hed taken on the task of finding her; then, when hed failed, thered been taking vengeance.And now he had the chance to find her again, to save her.And if he couldnt, he was still pulling a cheap, squeaky wheeled wagon behind him that would do for revenge.Miller shook his head.He was having too many moments like this, getting lost in his own thoughts.He took a fresh grip on the cart full of fusion bomb, leaned forward, and headed out.The station around him creaked the way he imagined an old sailing ship might have, timbers bent by waves of salt water and the great tidal tug of war between earth and moon.Here, it was stone, and Miller couldnt guess what forces were acting on it.Hopefully nothing that would interfere with the signal between his hand terminal and his cargo.He didnt want to be reduced to his component atoms unintentionally.It was getting more and more clear that he couldnt cover the whole station.Hed known that from the start.If Julie had gotten herself someplace obscure hidden in some niche or hole like a dying cat he wouldnt find her.Hed become a gambler, betting against all hope on drawing the inside straight.The voice of Eros shifted, different voices now, singing something in Hindi.A childs round, Eros harmonizing with itself in a growing richness of voices.Now that he knew to listen for it, he heard Julies voice threading its way among the others.Maybe it had always been there.His frustration verged on physical pain.She was so close, but he couldnt quite reach her.He pulled himself back into the main corridor complex.The hospital bays had been a good place to look for her too.Plausible.Fruitless.Hed looked at the two mercantile bio labs.Nothing.Hed tried the morgue, the police holding tanks.Hed even gone through the evidence room, bin after plastic bin of contraband drugs and confiscated weapons scattered on the floor like oak leaves in one of the grand parks.It had all meant something once.Each one had been part of a small human drama, waiting to be brought out into the light, part of a trial or at least a hearing.Some small practice for judgment day, postponed now forever.All points were moot.Something silver flew above him, faster than a bird, and then another, and then a flock, streaming by overhead.Light glittered off the living metal, bright as fish scales.Miller watched the alien molecule improvising in the space above him.You cant stop here, Holden said.You have to stop running and get on the right road.Miller looked over his shoulder.The captain stood, real and not, where his inner Julie would have been.Well, thats interesting, Miller thought.I know, he said.Its just I dont know where she went.And well, look around.Big place, you know?You can stop her or I will, his imaginary Holden said.If I just knew where she went, Miller said.She didnt, Holden said.She never went.Miller turned to look at him.The swarm of silver roiled overhead, chittering like insects or a badly tuned drive.The captain looked tired.Millers imagination had put a surprising swath of blood at the corner of the mans mouth.And then it wasnt Holden anymore; it was Havelock.The other Earther.His old partner.And then it was Muss, her eyes as dead as his own.Julie didnt go anyplace.Miller had seen her in the hotel room, back when he still hadnt believed that anything but a bad smell could rise from the grave.Back before.Shed been taken away in a body bag.And then taken somewhere else.The Protogen scientists had recovered her, harvested the protomolecule, and spread Julies remade flesh through the station like bees pollinating a field of wildflowers.Theyd given her the station, but before theyd done it, theyd put her someplace they thought they would be safe.Safe room.Until they were ready to distribute the thing, theyd want to contain it.To pretend it could be contained.It wasnt likely theyd have gone to the trouble of cleaning up after theyd gotten what they needed.It wasnt as if anyone else was going to be around to use the space, so chances were good she was still there.That narrowed things.There would be isolation wards in the hospital, but Protogen wouldnt have been likely to use facilities where non Protogen doctors and nurses might wonder what was happening.Unnecessary risk.All right.They could have set up in one of the manufacturing plants down by the port.There were plenty of places there that required all waldo work.But again, it would have been at the risk of being discovered or questioned before the trap was ready to spring.Its a drug house, Muss said in his mind.You want privacy, you want control.Extracting the bug from the dead girl and extracting the good shit from the poppy seeds might have different chemistry, but its still crime.Good point, Miller said.And near the casino level No, thats not right.The casino was the second stage.The first was the radiation scare.They put a bunch of people in the radiation shelters and cooked them to get the protomolecule good and happy, then they infected the casino level.So where would you put a drug kitchen that was close to the rad shelters?Muss asked.The roiling silver stream overhead veered left and then right, pouring through the air.Tiny curls of metal began to rain down, drawing thin trails of smoke behind them as they did.If I had the access?The backup environment controls.Its an emergency facility.No foot traffic unless someones running inventory.Its got all the equipment for isolation built in already.Wouldnt be hard.And since Protogen ran Eros security even before they put the disposable thugs in place, theyd be able to arrange it, Muss said, and she smiled joylessly.See?I knew you could think that through.For less than a second, Muss was gone and Julie Mao his Julie was in her place.She was smiling and beautiful.Radiant.Her hair floated around her as if she were swimming in zero g.  And then she was gone.His suit alarm warned him about an increasingly corrosive environment.Hang tight, he said to the burning air.Ill be right there.* * *   It was just less than thirty three hours from the moment hed realized that Juliette Andromeda Mao wasnt dead to the one when he cycled down the emergency seals and pulled his cart into Eros backup environmental control facility.The clean, simple lines and error reducing design of the place still showed under the outgrowth of the protomolecule.Barely.Knots of dark filament and nautilus spirals softened the corners of wall and floor and ceiling.Loops hung from the ceiling like Spanish moss.The familiar LED lights still shone under the soft growth, but more illumination came from the swarm of faint blue dots glowing in the air.His first step onto the floor sank him into a thick carpet up the ankle; the bomb cart would have to stay outside.His suit reported a wild mix of exotic gases and aromatic molecules, but all he smelled was himself.All the interior rooms had been remade.Transformed.He walked through the wastewater treatment control areas like a scuba diver in a grotto.The blue lights swirled around him as he passed, a few dozen adhering to his suit and glittering there.He almost didnt brush them off the helmets faceplate, thinking they would smear like dead fireflies, but they only swirled back up into the air.The air recycling monitors still danced and glowed, the thousand alarms and incident reports silhouetting the latticework of protomolecule that covered the screens.Water was flowing somewhere close by.She was in a hazmat analysis node, lying on a bed of the dark thread that spilled out from her spine until it was indistinguishable from a massive fairy tale cushion of her own flowing hair.Tiny points of blue light glittered on her face, her arms, her breasts.The bone spurs that had been pressing out of her skin had grown into sweeping, almost architectural connections with the lushness around her.Her legs were gone, lost in the tangle of dark alien webs; she reminded Miller of a mermaid who had traded her fins for a space station.Her eyes were closed, but he could see them shifting and dancing under the lids.And she was breathing.Miller stood beside her.She didnt have quite the same face as his imagined Julie.The real woman was wider through the jaw, and her nose wasnt as straight as he remembered it.He didnt notice that he was weeping until he tried to wipe the tears away, batting his helmet with a gloved hand.He had to make do with blinking hard until his sight cleared.All this time.All this way.And here was what hed come for.Julie, he said, putting his free hand on her shoulder.Hey.Julie.Wake up.I need you to wake up now.He had his suits medical supplies.If he needed to, he could dose her with adrenaline or amphetamines.Instead, he rocked her gently, like he had Candace on a sleepy Sunday morning, back when shed still been his wife, back in some distant, near forgotten lifetime.Julie frowned, opened her mouth, closed it.Julie.You need to wake up now.She moaned and lifted an ineffectual arm to push him away.Come back to me, he said.You need to come back now.Her eyes opened.They werent human anymore the sclera etched with swirls of red and black, the iris the same luminous blue as the fireflies.Not human, but still Julie.Her lips moved soundlessly.And then:  Where am I?Eros Station, Miller said.The place isnt what it used to be.Not even where it used to be, but   He pressed the bed of filament with his hand, judging it, and then rested his hip at her side like he was sitting on her bed.His body felt achingly tired and also lighter than it should.Not like low gravity.The unreal buoyancy had nothing to do with the weary flesh.Julie tried to talk again, struggled, stopped, tried again.Who are you?Yeah, we havent officially met, have we?My names Miller.I used to be a detective for Star Helix Security back on Ceres.Your parents contracted with us, only it was really more a friends in high places thing.I was supposed to track you down, grab you, ship you back down the well.Kidnap job?she said.Her voice was stronger.Her gaze seemed more focused.Pretty standard, Miller said, then sighed.I kind of cocked it up, though.Her eyes fluttered closed, but she kept talking.Something happened to me.Yeah.It did.Im scared.No, no, no.Dont be scared.Its all right.In an ass backward kind of way, but its all right.Look, right now the whole station is heading back for Earth.Really fast.I dreamed I was racing.I was going home.Yeah, we need to stop that.Her eyes opened again.She looked lost, anguished, alone.A tear streaked down from the corner of her eye, glowing blue.Give me your hand, Miller said.No, really, I need you to hold something for me.She lifted her hand slowly, seaweed in a soft current.He took his hand terminal, settled it in her palm, pressed her thumb to the dead mans switch.Just hold that there.Dont let it up.What is it?she asked.Long story, just dont let up.His suit alarms shrieked at him when he undid his helmet seals.He turned them off.The air was strange: acetate and cumin and a deep, powerful musk that made him think of hibernating animals.Julie watched him as he stripped off his gloves.Right then, the protomolecule was latching on to him, burrowing into his skin and eyes, getting ready to do to him what it had done to everyone on Eros.He didnt care.He took the hand terminal back and then laced his fingers through hers.Youre driving this bus, Julie, he said.Do you know that?I mean, can you tell?Her fingers were cool in his, but not cold.I can feel something, she said.Im hungry?Not hungry, but I want something.I want to go back to Earth.We cant do that.I need you to change course, Miller replied.What had Holden said?Give her Venus.Head for Venus instead.Thats not what it wants, she said.Its what weve got on offer, Miller said.Then, a moment later: We cant go home.We need to go to Venus.She was quiet for a long moment.Youre a fighter, Julie.Youve never let anyone call your shots for you.Dont start now.If we go to Earth   Itll eat them too.The same way it ate me.Yeah.She looked up at him.Yeah, he said again.Like that.What happens on Venus?We die maybe.I dont know.But we dont take a lot of people with us, and we make sure no one gets a hold of this crap, he said, gesturing at the grotto around them.And if we dont die, then well, thatll be interesting.I dont think I can.You can.The thing thats doing all this?Youre smarter than it is.Youre in control.Take us to Venus.The fireflies swirled around them, the blue light pulsing slightly: bright and dim, bright and dim.Miller saw it in her face when she made the decision.All around them, the lights went bright, the grotto flooding in soft blue, and then dimmed back to where they had been before.Miller felt something catch at the back of his neck like the first warning of a sore throat.He wondered if hed have time to deactivate the bomb.And then he looked at Julie.Juliette Andromeda Mao.OPA pilot.Heir to the Mao Kwikowski corporate throne.The seed crystal of a future beyond anything hed ever dreamed.Hed have plenty of time.Im afraid, she said.Dont be, he said.I dont know whats going to happen, she said.No one ever does.And, look, you dont have to do this alone, he said.I can feel something in the back of my mind.It wants something I dont understand.Its so big.Reflexively, he kissed the back of her hand.There was an ache starting deep in his belly.A sense of illness.A moments nausea.The first pangs of his transformation into Eros.Dont worry, he said.Were gonna be fine.Holden dreamed.Hed been a lucid dreamer most of his life, so when he found himself sitting in his parents kitchen in the old house in Montana, talking to Naomi, he knew.He couldnt quite understand what she was saying, but she kept pushing her hair out of her eyes as she munched cookies and drank tea.And while he found that he wasnt ever able to pick a cookie up and take a bite out of it, he could smell them, and the memory of Mother Elises chocolate chip oatmeal cookies was a very good one.It was a good dream.The kitchen strobed red once, and something changed.Holden felt the wrongness of it, felt the dream slipping from warm memory into nightmare.He tried to say something to Naomi but couldnt form the words.The room strobed red again, but she didnt seem to notice.He got up and went to the kitchen window and looked out.When the room strobed a third time, he saw what was causing it.Meteors were falling out of the sky, leaving behind them fiery trails the color of blood.He somehow knew they were chunks of Eros as it crashed through the atmosphere.Miller had failed.The nuclear attack had failed.Julie had come home.He turned around to tell Naomi to run, but black tendrils had burst through the floor and wrapped her up, pierced her body in multiple places.They poured from her mouth and eyes.Holden tried to run to her, to help her, but he couldnt move, and when he looked down, he saw that the tendrils had come up and grabbed him too.One wrapped around his waist and held him.Another pressed into his mouth.He woke with a yell in a dark room that was strobing with red light.Something was holding him around the waist.In a panic he began clawing at it, threatening to tear a fingernail loose on his left hand, before his rational mind reminded him where he was.On the ops deck, in his chair, belted down in zero g.   He popped his finger into his mouth, trying to soothe the abused fingertip hed damaged on one of the chair buckles, and took a few deep breaths through his nose.The deck was empty.Naomi was asleep down in her cabin.Alex and Amos were off duty and presumably sleeping too.Theyd spent almost two days without rest during the high g chase of Eros.Holden had ordered everyone to get some shut eye and had volunteered to take first watch.And then had promptly fallen asleep.Not good.The room flashed red again.Holden shook his head to clear the last of the sleep away, and refocused his attention on his console.A red warning light pulsed, and he tapped the screen to open up the menu.It was his threat panel.Someone was hitting them with a targeting laser.He opened up the threat display and turned on the active sensors.The only ship within millions of kilometers was the Ravi, and it was the ship that was targeting them.According to the automatic logs, it had just started a few seconds earlier.He reached out to activate the comm and call the Ravi as his incoming message light flickered on.He opened the connection, and a second later, McBrides voice said, Rocinante, cease maneuvering, open your outer airlock door, and prepare to be boarded.Holden frowned at his console.Was that a weird joke?McBride, this is Holden.Uh, what?Her reply was in a clipped tone that was not encouraging.Holden, open your outer airlock and prepare for boarding.If I see a single defensive system wake up, I will fire on your ship.Is that understood?No, he said, not quite able to keep the annoyance out of his voice.Its not understood.And Im not going to let you board me.What the hell is going on?Ive been ordered by UNN Command to take control of your vessel.Youre charged with interfering with UNN military operations, unlawfully commandeering UNN military assets, and a list of other crimes Im not going to bother reading right now.If you do not surrender immediately, we will be forced to fire on you.Oh, said Holden.The UNN had discovered that their missiles were changing course, had attempted to reprogram them, and had discovered that the missiles werent listening.They were upset.McBride, Holden said after a moment.Boarding us wont do any good.We cant give you those missiles back.And its unnecessary, anyway.Theyre just taking a little detour.McBrides laugh sounded more like the sharp bark of an angry dog just before it bit.Detour?she said.You handed three thousand five hundred and seventy three high yield thermonuclear interplanetary ballistic missiles over to a traitor and accused war criminal!It took Holden a minute.You mean Fred?I think traitor is a bit harsh   McBride cut in.Deactivate the false transponders leading our missiles away from Eros, and reactivate the transponders on the surface, or we will fire on your ship.You have ten minutes to comply.The connection dropped with a click.Holden looked at the console with something between disbelief and outrage, then shrugged and hit the battle stations alarm.Deck lights came on all over the ship in an angry red.The warning Klaxon sounded three times.In less than two minutes, Alex rushed up the ladder to the cockpit, and half a minute behind him, Naomi threw herself into her ops station.Alex spoke first.The Ravi is four hundred kilometers away, he said.Ladar says her tube is open, and shes got us locked.Clearly enunciating his words, Holden said, Do not I repeat, do not open our tubes or attempt to get a target lock on the Ravi at this time.Just keep a close eye on her, and prepare to go defensive if she looks like shes firing.Lets not do anything to provoke her.Shall I begin jamming?Naomi said from behind him.No, that would look aggressive.But prep a countermeasures package and have your finger on the ready button, Holden said.Amos, you in engineering?Roger that, Cap.Ready to go down here.Bring the reactor up to one hundred percent and pull control of the point defense cannons to your console down there.If they shoot at us at this range, Alex wont have time to fly and shoot back.You see a red dot on the threat console, you open up with the PDCs immediately.Copy?Roger that, Amos said.Holden blew a long breath through his teeth, then opened the channel to the Ravi again.McBride, this is Holden.We are not surrendering, we are not going to let you board us, and we arent going to comply with your demands.Where do we go from here?Holden, McBride said.Your reactor is coming up.Are you getting ready to fight with us?No, just getting ready to try and survive.Why, are we fighting?Another short harsh laugh.Holden, McBride said.Why do I get the feeling you arent taking this seriously?Oh, I absolutely am, Holden replied.I dont want you to kill me, and believe it or not, I have no desire to kill you.The nukes are on a little detour, but this isnt something we need to go down in flames over.I cant give you what you want, and Im not interested in spending the next thirty years in a military prison.You gain nothing by shooting us, and I will fight back if it comes to that.McBride cut the channel.Captain, Alex said.The Ravi is startin to maneuver.Shes spraying clutter.I think shes gettin ready to make an attack run.Shit.Holden had been so sure he could talk her out of it.Okay, go defensive.Naomi, start your countermeasures.Amos?Got your finger on that button?Ready, Amos replied.Dont hit it until you see a missile launch.Dont want to force their hand.Sudden crushing gs hit Holden, stuffing him into his chair.Alex had started maneuvering.At this distance, maybe I can out turn her.Keep her from bein able to take a shot, the pilot said.Do it, and open the tubes.Roger, Alex said, his professional pilots calm not quite able to keep the excitement about a possible battle out of his voice.Ive broken the targeting lock, Naomi said.Their laser array is not nearly as good as the Rocis.Im just drowning it in clutter.Hooray for bloated Martian defense budgets, Holden replied.The ship jerked suddenly through a series of wild maneuvers.Damn, Alex said, his voice strained by the g force of the sharp turns.The Ravi just opened up on us with her PDCs.Holden checked his threat display and saw the long glowing pearl strands of incoming rounds displayed there.The shots were falling well behind them.The Roci reported the distance between the ships as 370 kilometers pretty long range for computer targeting systems to hit a wildly maneuvering ship with a ballistic shot from another wildly maneuvering ship.Return fire?Amos yelled into the comm.No!Holden yelled back.If she wanted us dead, shed be throwing torpedoes.Dont give her a reason to want us dead.Cap, were out turnin her, Alex said.The Rocis just too fast.Well have a firing solution in less than a minute.Roger, Holden said.Do I take the shot?Alex asked, his silly Martian cowboy accent fading as his tension rose.No.Their targeting laser just shut off, Naomi said.Which means theyve given up trying to cut our jamming, Holden replied, and have just switched their missiles over to radar tracking.Not as accurate, Naomi said hopefully.A corvette like that carries at least a dozen fish.They only need to hit us with one to make us dead.And at this range   A gentle sound came from his threat console, letting him know that the Roci had calculated a firing solution to the Ravi.Ive got tone!Alex yelled.Fire?No!Holden said.He knew that inside the Ravi, they were getting the loud warning buzz of an enemy lock.Stop, Holden willed them.Please dont make me kill you.Uh, Alex said in a low voice.Huh.Behind Holden, at almost the same moment, Naomi said, Jim?Before he could ask, Alex came back on the general comm.Hey, Captain, Eros just came back.What?Holden said, a brief image of the asteroid sneaking up like a cartoon villain on the two circling warships popping into his head.Yeah, Alex said.Eros.It just popped back up on radar.Whatever it was doing to block our sensors, it just stopped doing it.Whats it doing?Holden said.Get me a course.Naomi pulled the tracking information to her console and began working on it, but Alex was done a few seconds sooner.Yeah, he said.Good guess.Its changing course.Still heading sunward, but deflecting away from the Earth vector it was on.If it keeps this course and speed, Naomi chimed in, Id say it was heading toward Venus.Wow, said Holden.That was a joke.Good joke, Naomi said.Well, someone tell McBride she doesnt need to shoot us now.Hey, Alex said, his voice thoughtful.If we made those nukes stop listening, that means we cant shut em down, right?Wonder where Freds going to drop those.Hell if I know, Amos said.Just disarmed Earth, though.Thats gotta be fucking embarrassing.Unintended consequences, Naomi sighed.Always with the unintended consequences.* * *   Eros crashing into Venus was the most widely broadcast and recorded event in history.By the time the asteroid reached the suns second planet, several hundred ships had taken up orbits there.Military vessels tried to keep the civilian ships away, but it was no use.They were just outnumbered.The video of Eros descent was captured by military gun cameras, civilian ship telescopes, and the observatories on two planets and five moons.Holden wished he could have been there to see it up close, but Eros had picked up speed after it had turned, almost as though the asteroid were impatient for the journey to end now that the destination was in sight.He and the crew sat in the galley of the Rocinante and watched it on the broadcast newsfeeds.Amos had dug up yet another bottle of faux tequila from somewhere and was liberally splashing it into coffee cups.Alex had them flying toward Tycho at a gentle one third g.  No need to hurry now.It was all over but the fireworks.Holden reached out, took Naomis hand, and held it tightly as the asteroid entered Venus orbit and then seemed to stop.He felt like he could feel the entire human race holding their breath.No one knew what Eros no, what Julie would do now.No one had spoken to Miller after the last time Holden had, and he wasnt answering his hand terminal.No one knew for sure what had happened on the asteroid.When the end came, it was beautiful.In orbit around Venus, Eros came apart like a puzzle box.The giant asteroid split into a dozen chunks, stringing out around the equator of the planet in a long necklace.Then those dozen pieces split into a dozen more, and then a dozen after that, a glittering fractal seed cloud spreading out across the entire surface of the planet, disappearing into the thick cloud layer that usually hid Venus from view.Wow, Amos said, his voice almost reverent.That was gorgeous, Naomi said.Vaguely unsettling, but gorgeous.They wont stay there forever, Holden said.Alex tossed off the last of the tequila in his glass, then refilled it from the bottle.What dya mean, Cap?he asked.Well, Im just guessing.But I doubt the things that built the protomolecule just wanted to store it here.This was part of a bigger plan.We saved the Earth, Mars, the Belt.Question is, what happens now?Naomi and Alex exchanged glances.Amos pursed his lips.On screen, Venus glittered as arcs of lightning danced all across the planet.Cap, Amos said.You are seriously harshing my buzz.Epilogue: Fred  Frederick Lucius Johnson.Former colonel in Earths armed forces, Butcher of Anderson Station.Thoth Station now too.Unelected prime minister of the OPA.He had faced his own mortality a dozen times, lost friends to violence and politics and betrayal.Hed lived through four assassination attempts, only two of which were on any record.Hed killed a pistol wielding attacker using only a table knife.Hed given the orders that had ended hundreds of lives, and stood by his decisions.And yet public speaking still made him nervous as hell.It didnt make sense, but there it was.Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads   General Sebastian will be at the reception, his personal secretary said.Remember not to ask after her husband.Why?I didnt kill him, did I?No, sir.Hes having a very public affair, and the generals a bit touchy about it.So she might want me to kill him.You can make the offer, sir.The greenroom was actually done in red and ochre, with a black leather couch, a mirrored wall, and a table laid out with hydroponic strawberries and carefully mineralized drinking water.The head of Ceres security, a dour faced woman named Shaddid, had escorted him from the dock to the conference facilities three hours earlier.Since then, hed been pacing three steps in one direction, turn, three steps back like the captain of an ancient ship of the line on his quarterdeck.Elsewhere in the station, the representatives of the formerly warring factions were in rooms of their own, with secretaries of their own.Most of them hated Fred, which wasnt particularly a problem.Most of them feared him too.Not because of his standing in the OPA, of course.Because of the protomolecule.The political rift between Earth and Mars was probably irreparable; the Earth forces loyal to Protogen had engineered a betrayal too deep for apologies, and too many lives had been lost on both sides for the coming peace to look anything like it had been before.The naive among the OPA thought this was a good thing: an opportunity to play one planet against the other.Fred knew better.Unless all three forces Earth, Mars, and the Belt could reach a real peace, they would inevitably fall back into a real war.Now if only Earth or Mars thought of the Belt as something more than an annoyance to be squashed after their true enemy was humiliated But in truth, anti Mars sentiment on Earth was higher now than it had been during the shooting war, and Martian elections were only four months away.A significant shift in the Martian polity could ease the tensions or make things immeasurably worse.Both sides had to see the big picture.Fred stopped before a mirror, adjusted his tunic for the hundredth time, and grimaced.When did I turn into a damned marriage counselor?he said.We arent still talking about General Sebastian, are we, sir?No.Forget I said anything.What else do I need to know?Theres a possibility that Blue Mars will try to disrupt your presentation.Hecklers and signs, not guns.Captain Shaddid has several Blues in custody, but some may have slipped past her.All right.You have interviews scheduled with two political narrowcasts and a news source based on Europa.The Europa interviewer is likely to ask about Anderson Station.All right.Anything new from Venus?Somethings happening down there, his secretary said.Its not dead, then.Apparently not, sir.Great, he said bitterly.Ladies and gentlemen, we stand at a crossroads.On one hand there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation, and on the other   And on the other, theres the bogeyman of Venus, getting ready to crawl up out of its well and slaughter you all in your sleep.I have the live sample, which is your best, if not only, hope of divining what its intentions and capabilities are, and which I have hidden so that you cant just march over and take it from me.Its the only reason any of you are listening to me in the first place.So how about a little respect here?His secretarys terminal chirped, and she consulted it briefly.Its Captain Holden, sir.Do I have to?It would be best if he felt he was part of the effort, sir.He has a track record of amateur press releases.Fine.Bring him in.The weeks that had passed since Eros Station had come apart in the thick skies of Venus had been good to Holden, but prolonged high g dives like the one the Rocinante had sustained chasing Eros had long lasting effects.The burst blood vessels in the mans sclera had healed; the pressure bruising was gone from around his eyes and the back of his neck.Only a little hesitation in the way he walked spoke of the deep joint pain, cartilage still on its way back to its natural form.Acceleration swagger, theyd called it, back when Fred had been a different man.Hey, Holden said.Youre looking pretty.Did you see the latest feed from Venus?Two kilometer high crystal towers.What do you think that is?Your fault?Fred suggested, keeping the tone friendly.You could have told Miller to drive it into the sun.Yes, because two kilometer high crystal towers coming out of the sun wouldnt be creepy at all, Holden said.Are those strawberries?Have some, Fred said.He hadnt been able to eat anything since that morning.So, Holden said around a mouthful of fruit, are they really going to sue me over this?Unilaterally giving away all mineral and development rights to an entire planet on an open radio channel?Yeah, Holden said.I would guess the people who actually owned those rights are probably going to sue you, Fred said.If they ever figure out who they are.Could you give me a hand with that?Holden asked.Ill be a character witness, Fred said.I dont actually make the law.Then what exactly are you all doing here?Couldnt there be some kind of amnesty?We retrieved the protomolecule, tracked down Julie Mao on Eros, broke Protogen, and saved Earth.You saved Earth?We helped, Holden said, but his voice had a more somber tone.Millers death still bothered the captain.Fred knew how that felt.It was a joint effort.Freds personal secretary cleared her throat and glanced toward the door.Theyd need to go soon.Ill do what I can, Fred said.Ive got a lot of other things on the plate, but Ill do what I can.And Mars cant have the Roci back, Holden said.Right of salvage says thats my ship now.They arent going to see it that way, but I will do what I can.You keep saying that.It keeps being all I can do.And youll tell them about him, right?Holden said.Miller.He deserves the credit.The Belter who went back into Eros of his own free will in order to save Earth?Youre damn right Im going to tell them about him.Not the Belter.Him.Josephus Aloisus Miller.Holden had stopped eating the free strawberries.Fred crossed his arms.Youve been reading up, Fred said.Yeah.Well.I didnt know him all that well.Neither did anybody else, Fred said, and then softened a little.I know its hard, but we dont need a real man with a complex life.We need a symbol of the Belt.An icon.Sir, the secretary said.We really do need to go now.Thats what got us here, Holden said.Icons.Symbols.People without names.All of those Protogen scientists were thinking about biomass and populations.Not Mary who worked in supply and raised flowers in her spare time.None of them killed her.You think they wouldnt have?I think if they were going to, they owed it to her to know her name.All their names.And you owe it to Miller not to make him into something he wasnt.Fred laughed.He couldnt help it.Captain, he said, if youre saying that I should amend my address to the peace conference so that it wasnt a noble Belter sacrificing himself to save the Earth if youre suggesting that I say something like We happened to have a suicidal ex cop on site instead you understand this process less than I thought you did.Millers sacrifice is a tool, and Im going to use it.Even if it makes him faceless, Holden said.Even if it makes him something he never was?Especially if it makes him something he never was, Fred said.Do you remember what he was like?Holden frowned and then something flickered in his eyes.Amusement.Memory.He was kind of a pain in the ass, wasnt he?Holden said.That man could take a visitation from God with thirty underdressed angels announcing that sex was okay after all and make it seem vaguely depressing.He was a good man, Holden said.He wasnt, Fred said.But he did his job.And now Ive got to go do mine.Give em hell, Holden said.And amnesty.Keep talking up the amnesty.Fred walked down the curving hallway, his secretary close behind him.The conference halls had been designed for smaller things.Petty ones.Hydroponics scientists getting away from their husbands and wives and children to get drunk and talk about raising bean sprouts.Miners coming together to lecture each other about waste minimization and tailings disposal.High school band competitions.And instead, these work carpets and brushed stone walls were going to have to bear the fulcrum of history.It was Holdens fault that the shabby, small surroundings reminded him of the dead detective.They hadnt before.The delegations were seated across the aisle from each other.The generals and political appointees and general secretaries of Earth and Mars, the two great powers together at his invitation to Ceres, to the Belt.Territory made neutral because neither side took it seriously enough to be concerned about their demands.All of history had brought them here, to this moment, and now, in the next few minutes, Freds job was to change that trajectory.The fear was gone.Smiling, he stepped up to the speakers dais, the podium.The pulpit.There was a scattering of polite applause.A few smiles, and a few frowns.Fred grinned.He wasnt a man anymore.He was a symbol, an icon.A narrative about himself and about the forces at play in the solar system.And for a moment, he was tempted.In that hesitation between drawing breath and speaking, part of him wondered what would happen if he shed the patterns of history and spoke about himself as a man, about the Joe Miller who hed known briefly, about the responsibility they all shared to tear down the images they held of one another and find the genuine, flawed, conflicted people they actually were.It would have been a noble way to fail.Ladies and gentlemen, he said.We stand at a crossroads.On one hand, there is the very real threat of mutual annihilation.On the other   He paused for effect.On the other, the stars.Extras    Meet the author  JAMES S.

Martins assistant.They both live in Albuquerque, New Mexico.Find out more about this series at www.the expanse.com.Interview  Leviathan Wakes is the first book in a series called The Expanse.What kind of story are you telling in this series?Theres a lot of science fiction that talks about the near future.Theres a lot about great galaxy spanning empires of the distant future.But theres not much that talks about the part in between.The Expanse is playing on that bridge.Whatever drives us off Earth to the rest of the solar system or from there to the stars, the problems we have are the ones we bring with us.What I want to do is write good old fashioned space opera centered around human stories, but with an increasingly large backdrop.It seems like Leviathan Wakes is a science fiction book, but it borrows from a lot of other genres as well, including horror and noir.Did you intend to blend those genres?What kind of book do you feel this is?Its definitely science fiction of the old school space opera variety.Thats the story I wanted to tell.But half of the story was a detective story, and as soon as Detective Miller hit the page, he told me in a loud voice that he was a classic noir character.It was in his voice and the way he talked about things, you know?As for the horror feel, thats just the way I roll.Ive never written anything in my life that didnt at least blur the line into horror.If I wrote greeting cards, theyd probably have a squick factor.Leviathan Wakes has two protagonists with very different worldviews, which are often in conflict.Can you describe those views and why you chose that particular conflict?You know how they say science fiction is about the future youre writing about, but its also about the time youre writing in?Holden and Miller have got two different views on the ethical use of information.Thats very much a current argument.Holdens my holy fool.Hes an idealist, a man who faces things with this very optimistic view of humanity.He believes that if you give people all of the information, theyll do the right thing with it, because people are naturally good.Miller is a cynic and a nihilist.He looks at the dissemination of information as a game you play.He doesnt have faith in anyone elses moral judgment.Control of information is how you get people to do what you want, and he doesnt trust anyone else to make that call.I picked those two characters because theyre both right, and theyre both wrong.By having them in the same story, I can have them talk to each other.And that central disagreement is sort of underneath everything else that happens.Leviathan Wakes has a gritty and realistic feel.How much research did you do on the technology side of things, and how important was it to you that they be realistic and accurate?Okay, so what youre really asking me there is if this is hard science fiction.The answer is an emphatic no.I have nothing but respect for well written hard science fiction, and I wanted everything in the book to be plausible enough that it doesnt get in the way.But the rigorous how to with the math shown?Its not that story.This is working mans science fiction.Its like in Alien, we meet the crew of the Nostromo doing their jobs in this very blue collar environment.Theyre truckers, right?Why is there a room in the Nostromo where water leaks down off of chains suspended from the ceiling?Because it looks cool and makes the world feel a little messy.It gives you the feel of the world.Ridley Scott doesnt explain why that room exists, and when most people watch the film, it never even occurs to them to ask.What kind of drive does the Nostromo use?I bet no one walked out of the film asking that question.I wanted to tell a story about humans living and working in a well populated solar system.I wanted to convey a feeling of what that would be like, and then tell a story about the people who live there.So how does the Epstein drive work?Very well.Efficiently.In your acknowledgments you thank the New Mexico Critical Mass writers group.What effect did having that workshop environment have on your work?Well, Critical Mass is a lot more than a workshop or critical group.Its more like a writers mafia.Just about anything you might need, someone in the group can get it for you.Walter Jon Williams, who wrote the brilliant Dread Empires Fall space opera series, was there to give important tips about writing in that genre.S.  M.  Stirling and Victor Milan write some of best action in the business, and there was a lot of action for them to critique.Ian Tregillis is an actual astrophysicist and made himself available for technical questions.Melinda Snodgrass is pretty much the Yoda of letting you know when youve wandered too far away from your plot.And the entire group, including Emily Mah, Terry England, and George R.  R.  Martin, was there to read and critique the early drafts of the book, and a lot of changes were made based on their advice.Youve worked with George R.  R.  Martin a lot in the past.What kind of advice did he have for this project?Yes, Ive done a number of projects with him in one incarnation or another.In this case, he was mostly just encouraging.He likes old fashioned space opera, and he followed my progress on the book with great interest.He was also the first to read the final version.He was very complimentary.He said at one point that it was the best book about vomit zombies hed ever read.That was nice.Where do you see the Expanse series going from here?Well, Im contracted with Orbit for at least two more books.They are titled Calibans War and Dandelion Sky.I hope to keep exploring the idea of human expansion into the solar system and beyond, and balancing the very real threats that the galaxy poses for the fledgling human diaspora against the threats that those same humans will bring with them.For up to date information on what Im up to and where the project is headed, people can visit www.the expanse.com and get the latest.Introducing  If you enjoyed LEVIATHAN WAKES,  look out for  CALIBANS WAR  Book Two of The Expanse  by James S.  A.  Corey  Snoopys out again, Private Hillman said.I think his CO must be pissed at him.Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper of the Martian Marine Corps upped the magnification on her armors heads up display and looked in the direction Hillman was pointing.Twenty five hundred meters away, a squad of four United Nations marines were tromping around their outpost, backlit by the giant greenhouse dome they were guarding.A greenhouse dome identical in nearly all respects to the dome that was behind her.One of the four UN marines had black smudges on the sides of his helmet that looked like beagle ears.Yep, thats Snoopy, Bobbie said.Been on every patrol detail so far today.Wonder what he did.Guard duty around the greenhouses on Ganymede meant doing what you could to keep your mind occupied.Including speculating on the lives of the marines on the other side.The other side.Eighteen months before, there hadnt been sides.The inner planets had all been one big, happy, slightly dysfunctional family.Then the Eros incident, and now the two superpowers were dividing up the solar system between them, and the one moon neither side was willing to give up was Ganymede, breadbasket of the Jovian system.As the only moon with any magnetosphere, it was the only place where dome grown crops stood a chance in Jupiters harsh radiation belt, and even there, the domes and habitats had to be shielded to protect civilians from the eight rems a day burning off Jupiter and onto the moons surface.Bobbies armor had been designed to let a soldier walk through a nuclear bomb crater an hour after the blast.It also worked well at keeping Jupiter from frying Martian marines.Behind the Earth soldiers on patrol, their dome glowed in a shaft of weak sunlight captured by enormous orbital mirrors.Even with the mirrors, most terrestrial plants would have died, starved of sunlight.Only the heavily modified versions the Ganymede scientists cranked out could hope to survive in the trickle of light the mirrors fed them.Be sunset soon, Bobbie said, still watching the Earth marines outside their little guard hut, knowing they were watching her too.In addition to Snoopy, she spotted the one they called Stumpy because he or she couldnt be much more than a meter and a half tall.She wondered what their nickname for her was.Maybe Big Red.Her armor still had the Martian surface camouflage on it.She hadnt been on Ganymede long enough to get it resurfaced with mottled gray and white.One by one, over the course of five minutes, the orbital mirrors winked out as Ganymede passed behind Jupiter for a few hours.The glow from the greenhouse behind her changed to actinic blue as the artificial lights came on.While the overall light level didnt go down much, the shadows shifted in strange and subtle ways.Above, the sun not even a disk from here as much as the brightest star flashed as it passed behind Jupiters limb, and for a moment the planets faint ring system was visible.Theyre going back in, Corporal Travis said.Snoops bringing up the rear.Poor guy.Can we bail too?Bobbie looked around at the featureless dirty ice of Ganymede.Even in her high tech armor she could feel the moons chill.Nope.Her squad grumbled but fell in line as she led them on a slow low gravity shuffle around the dome.In addition to Hillman and Travis, she had a green private named Gourab on this patrol.And even though hed been in the marines all of about a minute and a half, he grumbled just as loud as the other two in his Mariner Valley drawl.She couldnt blame them.It was make work.Something for the Martian soldiers on Ganymede to do to keep them busy.If Earth decided it needed Ganymede all to itself, four grunts walking around the greenhouse dome wouldnt stop them.With dozens of Earth and Mars warships in a tense standoff in orbit, if hostilities broke out, the ground pounders would probably find out only when the surface bombardment began.To her left, the dome rose to almost half a kilometer: triangular glass panels separated by gleaming copper colored struts that turned the entire structure into a massive Faraday cage.Bobbie had never been inside one of the greenhouse domes.Shed been sent out from Mars as part of a huge surge in troops to the outer planets and had been walking patrols on the surface almost since day one.Ganymede to her was a spaceport, a small marine base, and the even smaller guard outpost she currently called home.As they shuffled around the dome, Bobbie watched the unremarkable landscape.Ganymede didnt change much without a catastrophic event.The surface was mostly silicate rock and water ice a few degrees warmer than space.The atmosphere was oxygen so thin it could pass as an industrial vacuum.Ganymede didnt weather.It changed when rocks fell on it from space, or when warm water from the liquid core forced itself onto the surface and created short lived lakes.Neither thing happened all that often.At home on Mars, wind and dust changed the landscape hourly.Here, she was walking through the footsteps of the day before and the day before and the day before.And if she never came back, those footprints would outlive her.Privately, she thought it was sort of creepy.A rhythmic squeaking started to cut through the normally smooth hiss and thump sounds her powered armor made.She usually kept the suits HUD minimized.It got so crowded with information that a marine knew everything except what was actually in front of her.Now she pulled it up, using blinks and eye movements to page over to the suits diagnostic screen.A yellow telltale warned her that the suits left knee actuator was low on hydraulic fluid.Must be a leak somewhere, but a slow one, because the suit couldnt find it.Hey, guys, hold up a minute, Bobbie said.Hilly, you have any extra hydraulic fluid in your pack?Yep, said Hillman, already pulling it out.Give my left knee a squirt, would you?While Hillman crouched in front of her, working on her suit, Gourab and Travis began an argument that seemed to be about sports.Bobbie tuned it out.This suit is ancient, Hillman said.You really oughta upgrade.This sort of thing is just going to happen more and more often, you know.Yeah, I should, Bobbie said.But the truth was that was easier said than done.Bobbie was not the right shape to fit into one of the standard suits, and the marines made her jump through a series of flaming hoops every time she requisitioned a new custom one.At two meters tall, she was only a bit above average height for a Martian male, but thanks in part to her Polynesian ancestry, she weighed in at more than 140 kilos at one g.  It wasnt fat, but her muscles seemed to get bigger every time she even walked through a weight room, and as a marine, she trained all the time.The suit she had now was the first one in twelve years of active duty that actually seemed to fit well.And even though it was beginning to show its age, it was just easier to try to keep it running than beg and plead for a new one.Hillman was just starting to put his tools away when Bobbies radio crackled to life.Outpost four to stickman.Come in, stickman.Roger four, Bobbie replied.This is stickman one.Go ahead.Stickman one, where are you guys?Youre half an hour late and some shit is going down over here.Sorry four, some equipment trouble here, Bobbie said, wondering what sort of shit might be going down, but not enough to ask about it over an open frequency.Return to the outpost immediately.We have shots fired at the UN outpost.Were going into lockdown.It took Bobbie a moment to parse that.She could see her men staring at her, their faces a mix of puzzlement and fear.Uh, the Earth guys are shooting at you?she finally asked.Not yet, but theyre shooting.Get your asses back here.Hillman jumped to his feet.Bobbie flexed her knee once and got greens on her diagnostic.She gave Hilly a nod of thanks, then said, Double time it back to the outpost.Go.* * *   Bobbie and her squad were still half a kilometer from the outpost when the general alert went out.Her suits HUD came up on its own, switching to combat mode.The sensor package went to work looking for hostiles and linked up to one of the satellites for a top down view.She felt the click as the gun built into the suits right arm switched to free fire mode.A thousand alarms would be sounding if an orbital bombardment had begun, but she couldnt help looking up at the sky anyway.No flashes or missile trails.Nothing but Jupiters bulk.Bobbie took off for the outpost at a dead run.Her squad followed without a word.A person trained in the use of a strength augmenting suit running in low gravity could cover a lot of ground quickly.The outpost came into view around the curve of the dome in just a few seconds, and a few seconds after that, the cause of the alarm.UN marines were charging at the Martian outpost.The yearlong cold war was going hot.Somewhere deep behind the cool mental habits of training and discipline, she was surprised.She hadnt really thought this day would come.The rest of her platoon were out of the outpost and arranged in a firing line facing the UN position.Someone had driven Yojimbo out onto the line, and the four meter tall combat mech towered over the other marines, looking like a headless giant in power armor, his massive cannon moving slowly as it tracked the incoming Earth troops.The UN soldiers were covering the 2,500 meters between the two outposts at full speed.Why isnt anyone talking?she wondered.The silence coming from her platoon was eerie.And then, just as her squad got to the firing line, her suit squealed a jamming warning at her.The top down vanished as she lost contact with the satellite.Her teams life signs and equipment status reports went dead as her link to their suits was cut off.The faint static of the open comm channel disappeared, leaving an even more unsettling silence.She used hand motions to place her team at the right flank, then moved up the line to find Lieutenant Givens, her CO.She spotted his suit right at the center of the line, almost directly under Yojimbo.She ran up and placed her helmet against his.What the fuck is going on, El Tee?she shouted.He gave her an irritated look and yelled, Your guess is as good as mine.We cant tell them to back off because of the jamming, and visual warnings are being ignored.Before the radio cut out, I got authorization to fire if they come within half a klick of our position.Bobbie had a couple hundred more questions, but the UN troops would cross the five hundred meter mark in just a few more seconds, so she ran back to anchor the right flank with her squad.Along the way, she had her suit count the incoming forces and mark them all as hostiles.The suit reported seven targets.Less than a third of the UN troops at their outpost.This makes no sense.She had her suit draw a line on the HUD at the five hundred meter mark.She didnt tell her boys that was the free fire zone.She didnt need to.Theyd open fire when she did without needing to know why.The UN soldiers had crossed the one kilometer mark, still without firing a shot.They were coming in a scattered formation, with six out front in a ragged line, and a seventh bringing up the rear about seventy meters behind.Her suit HUD selected the figure on the far left of the enemy line as her target, picking the one closest to her by default.Something itched at the back of her brain and she overrode the suit and selected the target at the rear and told it to magnify.The small figure suddenly enlarged in her targeting reticule.She felt a chill move down her back and magnified again.The figure chasing the six UN marines wasnt wearing a suit.Nor was it, properly speaking, human.Its skin was covered in chitinous plates, like large black scales.Its head was a massive horror, easily twice as large as it should be and covered in strange protruding growths.But most disturbing of all were its hands.Far too large for its body, and too long for their width, they were a childhood nightmare version of hands.The hands of the troll under the bed or the witch sneaking in through the window.They flexed and grasped at nothing with a constant manic energy.The Earth forces werent attacking.They were retreating.Shoot the thing chasing them, Bobbie yelled to no one.Before the UN soldiers could cross the half kilometer that would cause the Martians to open fire, the thing caught them.Oh, holy shit, Bobbie whispered.Holy shit.It grabbed one UN marine in its huge hands and tore the man in half like paper.Titanium and ceramic armor tore as easily as the flesh inside, spilling broken bits of technology and wet human viscera indiscriminately onto the ice.The remaining five soldiers ran even harder, but the monster chasing them barely slowed as it killed.Shoot it shoot it shoot it, Bobbie screamed and opened fire.Bobbies training and the technology of her combat suit combined to make her an extremely efficient killing machine.As soon as her finger pulled the trigger on her suits gun, a stream of two millimeter armor piercing rounds streaked out at the creature at a thousand meters per second.In just under one second, she fired nearly fifty rounds at it.It was a relatively slow moving human sized target, running in a straight line.Her targeting computer could do ballistic corrections that would let her hit a softball sized object moving at supersonic speeds.Every bullet she fired at the monster hit.It didnt matter.The rounds went through it, probably not slowing appreciably before they exited.Each exit wound sprouted a spray of black filaments that fell onto the snow instead of blood.It was like shooting water.The wounds closed almost faster than they were created; the only sign the thing had even been hit was the trail of black fibers in its wake.And then it caught a second UN marine.Instead of tearing him to pieces like it had the last one, it spun and hurled the fully armored Earther probably massing more than five hundred kilos total toward Bobbie.Her HUD tracked the UN soldier on his upward arc and helpfully informed her that the monster had thrown him not toward her, but at her.In a very flat trajectory.Which meant fast.She dove to the side as quickly as her suit would let her.The hapless UN marine swiped Hillman, whod been standing next to her, and then both of them were gone, bouncing down the ice at lethal speeds.By the time she turned back to the monster, it had killed two more UN soldiers.The entire Martian line opened fire on it, including Yojimbos big cannon.The two remaining Earth soldiers diverged and ran at angles away from the thing, trying to give their Martian counterparts an open firing lane.The creature was hit hundreds, thousands of times.It stitched itself back together while remaining at a full run, never more than slowing when one of Yojimbos cannon shots detonated nearby.Bobbie, back on her feet, joined in the barrage but it didnt make any difference.The creature slammed into the Martian line, killing two marines faster than the eye could follow.Yojimbo slid to one side, far more nimble than a machine of its size should be.Bobbie though Said must be driving it.He swore he could make the big mech dance the tango when he wanted to.It didnt matter.Even before Said could bring the mechs cannon around for a point blank shot, the creature ran right up its side, gripped the pilot hatch, and tore the door off its hinges.Said was snatched from his cockpit harness and hurled sixty meters straight up.The other marines had begun to fall back, firing as they went.Without radio, there was no way to coordinate the retreat.Bobbie found herself running toward the dome with the rest.The small and distant part of her mind that wasnt panicking knew that the domes glass and metal would offer no protection against something that could tear an armored man in half and rip a nine ton mech to pieces.That part of her mind recognized the futility in attempting to override her terror.By the time she found the external door to the dome, there was only one other marine left with her.Gourab.Up close, she could see his face through the armored glass of his helmet.He was screaming something at her she couldnt hear.She started to lean forward to touch helmets with him when he shoved her backward onto the ice.He was hammering on the door controls with one metal fist, trying to smash his way in in his mindless panic, when the creature caught him and peeled the helmet off his suit.Gourab stood for one moment, face in vacuum, eyes blinking and mouth open in a soundless scream; then the creature tore off his head as easily as it had his helmet.It turned and looked at Bobbie, still flat on her back.Up close, she could see that it had bright blue eyes.A glowing, electric blue.They were beautiful.She raised her gun and held down the trigger for half a second before she realized shed run out of ammo long before.The creature looked at her gun with what she would have sworn was curiosity, then looked into her eyes and cocked its head to one side.This is it, she thought.This is how I go out, and Im not going to know what did it, or why.Dying she could handle.Dying without any answers seemed terribly cruel.The creature took one step toward her, then stopped and shuddered.A new pair of limbs burst out of its midsection and writhed in the air like tentacles.Its head, already grotesque, seemed to swell up.The blue eyes flashed as bright as the lights in the domes.And then it exploded in a ball of fire that hurled her away across the ice and slammed her into a low ridge hard enough for the impact absorbing gel in her suit to go rigid, freezing her in place.She lay on her back, fading toward unconsciousness.The night sky above her began to flash with light.The ships in orbit, shooting.Cease fire, she thought, pressing the thought out into the blackness.They were retreating.Cease fire.Her radio was still out.She couldnt tell anyone that the UN marines hadnt been attacking.Or that something else had.
