There were walls, but from the high end of the garden, she could see over them.The walls angled this way and that, and in places she could see their other side.The windows slits were like something out of her history lessons: they let you shoot arrows or bullets without making a target of yourself.When the sun was out, Johanna liked to sit where the smell of the feather leaves was strongest, and look over the lower walls at the bay.She still wasn't sure just what she was seeing.There was a harbor; the forest of spars was almost like the marinas on Straum.The town had wide streets, but they zigged and zagged and the buildings along them were all askew.In places there were open roofed mazes of stone; from up here, she could see the pattern.And there was another wall, a rambling thing that ran for as far as she could see.The hills beyond were crowned with gray rock and patches of snow.She could see the dogthings down in the town.Individually, you could almost mistake them for dogs (snake necked, rat headed ones).But watch them from a distance and you saw their true nature.They always moved in small groups, never more than six.Within the pack they touched, cooperated with clever grace.But she never saw one group come closer than about ten meters to another.From her distant viewpoint, the members of a pack seemed to merge and she could imagine she was seeing one multilimbed beast ambling cautiously along, careful not to come too close to a similar monster.By now, the conclusion was inescapable: one pack, one mind.Minds so evil they could not bear to be close to one another.Her fifth time in the garden was the prettiest yet, a coercion toward joy.The flowers had sprayed downy seeds into the air.The lowering sunlight sparkled off them as they floated by the thousands on the slow breeze, clots in an invisible syrup.She imagined what Jefri would do here: first pretend grownup dignity, then bounce from one foot to the other.Finally he would race down the hillside, trying to capture as many of the flying tufts as he could.Laughing and laughing  "One, two, how do you do?"It was a child's voice, behind her.Johanna jumped up so fast she almost tore her stitches.Sure enough, there was a pack behind her.They  it?was the one who had cut the arrow out of her.A mangy lot.The five were crouched, ready to run away.They looked almost as surprised as Johanna felt."One, two, how do you do?"The voice came again, exactly as before.It might as well have been a recording, except that one of the animals was somehow synthesizing the sound with the buzzing patches of skin on its shoulders, haunches and head.The parrot act was nothing new to her.But this time the words were almost appropriate.The voice was not hers, but she had heard that chant before.She put hands on hips and stared at the pack.Two of the animals stared back; the others seemed to be admiring the scenery.One licked nervously at its paw.The two rear ones were carrying her dataset!Suddenly she knew where they'd gotten that singsong question.And she knew what they expected in response."I am fine and how do you do?"she said.The pack's eyes widened almost comically."I am fine, so then are we all!"It completed the game, then emitted a burst of gobbling.Someone replied from down the hill.There was another pack there, lurking in the bushes.She knew that if she stayed near this one, the other wouldn't approach.So the Tines  she always thought of them by those claws on their front feet; those she would never forget  had been playing with the Pink Oliphaunt, and hadn't been stopped by the booby traps.That was better than Jefri ever managed.It was clear they had fallen into the kindermode language programs.She should have thought of that.When the dataset noted sufficiently asinine responses it would adapt its behavior, first for young children, and  if that didn't work  for youngsters who didn't even speak Samnorsk.With just a little cooperation from Johanna, they could learn her language.Did she want that?The pack walked a little nearer, at least two of them watching her all the time.They didn't seem quite so ready to bolt as before.The nearest one dropped to its belly and looked up at her.Very cute and helpless, if you didn't see the claws."My name is  " Johanna heard a short burst of gobble with an overtone that seemed to buzz right through her head."What is your name?"Johanna knew it was all part of the language script.There was no way the creature could understand the individual words it was saying.That "my name, your name" pair was repeated over and over again between the children in the language program.A vegetable would get the point eventually.Still, the Tines pronunciation was so perfect  "My name is Johanna," she said."Zjohanna," said the pack, with Johanna's voice, and splitting the word stream incorrectly."Johanna," corrected Johanna.She wasn't even going to try saying the Tines name."Hello, Johanna.Let's play the naming game!"And that was from the script too, complete with silly enthusiasm.Johanna sat down.Sure, learning Samnorsk would give the Tines power over her but it was the only way she could learn about them, the only way she could learn about Jefri.And if they had murdered Jefri, too?Well then, she would learn to hurt them as much as they deserved.At Woodcarvers and then  a few days later  at Flenser's Hidden Island, the long daylight of arctic summer ended.At first there was a little twilight just around midnight, when even the highest hill stood in shadow.And then the hours of dark grew quickly.Day fought night, and night was winning.The featherleaf in the low valleys changed to autumn colors.Looking up a fjord in daylight was to see orange red on the lower hills, then the green of heather merging imperceptibly to the grays of lichen and the darker grays of naked rock.The snowpatches waited for their time; it would come soon.At every sunset, each day a few minutes earlier, Tyrathect toured the ramparts of Flenser's outer wall.It was a three mile walk.The lower levels were guarded by linear packs, but up here there were only a few lookouts.When she approached, they stepped aside with military precision.More than military precision; she saw the fear in their look.It was hard to get used to that.For almost as far back as she had clear memories  twenty years  Tyrathect had lived in fear of others, in shame and guilt, in search of someone to follow.Now all that was turned on its head.It was not an improvement.She knew now, from the inside, the evil she had given herself to.She knew why the sentries feared her.To them, she was Flenser.Of course, she never gave any hint of these thoughts.Her life was only as safe as the success of her fraud.Tyrathect had worked hard to suppress her natural, shy mannerisms.Not once since coming to Hidden Island had she caught herself in the old bashful habit of heads lowering, eyes closing.Instead, Tyrathect had the Flenser stare  and she used it.Her passage around the top wall was as stark and ominous as Flenser's had ever been.She looked out over her  his  domain with the same hard gaze as before, all heads front, as if seeing visions beyond the petty minds of the disciples.They must never guess her real reason for these sunset sweeps: for a time, the days and nights were like in the Republic.She could almost imagine she was still back there, before the Movement and the massacre at Parliament Bowl, before they cut her throats and wed pieces of Flenser to the stumps of her soul.In the gold and russet fields beyond the stone curtains, she could see peasants trimming the fields and the herds.Flenser ruled lands far beyond her view, but he had never imported food.The grain and meat that filled the storehouses were all produced within a two day march of the straits.The strategic intent was clear; still, it made for a peaceful evening's view and brought back memories of her home and school.The sun slid sideways into the mountains; long shadows swept the farm lands.Flenser's castle was left an island in a sea of shadow.Tyrathect could smell the cold.There would be frost again tonight.Tomorrow the fields would be covered with false snow that would last an hour past sunrise.She pulled the long jackets close around her and walked to the eastern lookout.Across the straits, one of the near hilltops was still in the sun.The alien ship had landed there.It was still there, but now behind wood and stone.Steel began building there right after the landing.The quarries at the north end of Hidden Island were busier now than ever in Flenser's time.The barges hauling stone to the mainland made a steady traffic across the straits.Even now that the light was not dayround, Steel's construction went on nonstop.His Incallings and lesser inspections were harsher than Flenser's had used to be.Lord Steel was a killer; worse, a manipulator.But since the alien landing, Tyrathect knew that he was something else: deathly afraid.He had good reason.And even though the folk he feared might ultimately kill them all, in her secret soul she wished them well.Steel and his Flenserists had attacked the star people without warning, more out of greed than fear.They had killed dozens of beings.In a way the murders were worse than what the Movement had done to her.Tyrathect had followed the Flenser of her own free will.She had had friends who warned her about the Movement.There had been dark stories about the Flenser, and not all had been government propaganda.But she had so wanted to follow, to give herself to Something Greater They had used her, literally as their tool.Yet she could have avoided it.The star people had had no such option; Steel simply butchered them.So now Steel labored out of fear.In the first three days he had covered the flying ship with a roof: a sudden, silly farmhouse had appeared on the hilltop.Before long the alien craft would be hidden behind stone walls.Ultimately, the new fortress might be bigger than the one on Hidden Island.Steel knew that if his villainy did not destroy him, it would make him the most powerful pack in the world.And that was Tyrathect's reason for staying, for continuing her masquerade.She couldn't go on forever.Sooner or later the other fragments would reach Hidden Island; Tyrathect would be destroyed and all of Flenser would live again.Perhaps she wouldn't survive even that long.Two of Tyrathect were of Flenser.The Master had miscalculated in thinking they could dominate the other three.Instead the conscience of the three had come to own the brilliance of the two.She remembered almost everything the great Flenser had known, all the tricks and all the betrayals.The two had given her an intensity she had never had before.Tyrathect laughed to herself.In a sense, she had gained what she had been so naively seeking in the Movement; and the great Flenser had made exactly the mistake that in his arrogance he thought impossible.As long as she could keep the two under control, she had a chance.When she was all awake, there wasn't much problem; she still felt herself a "she", still remembered her life in the Republic more clearly than the Flenser memories.It was different when she slept.There were nightmares.The memories of torment inflicted suddenly seemed sweet.Sleep time sex should soothe; with her it was a battle.She awoke sore and cut, as if she had been fighting a rapist.If the two ever broke free, if she ever awoke a "he" It would take only a few seconds for the two to denounce the masquerade, only a little longer to kill the three and put the Flenser members aboard a more manageable pack.Yet she stayed.Steel meant to use the aliens and their ship to spread Flenser's nightmare worldwide.But his plan was fragile, with risks on every side.If there was anything she could do to destroy it and the Flenser Movement, she would.Across the castle, only the western tower still hung in sunlight.No faces showed at the window slits, but eyes looked out: Steel watched the Flenser Fragment  the Flenser in Waiting as it styled itself  on the ramparts below.The fragment was accepted by all the commanders.In fact, they accorded it almost the awe they had given to the full Flenser.In a sense, Flenser had made them all, so it wasn't surprising they felt a chill in the Master's presence.Even Steel felt it.In his shaping, Flenser had forced the aborning Steel to try to kill him; each time Steel had been caught and his weakest members tortured.Steel knew the conditioning that was there, and that helped him fight it.If anything, he told himself, the Flenser Frag was in greater danger because of it: in trying to counter the fear, Steel might just miscalculate, and act more violently than was appropriate.Sooner or later Steel had to decide.If he didn't kill it before the other fragments reached Hidden Island, then all of Flenser would be here again.If two members could dominate Steel's regime, then six would totally erase it.Did he want the Master dead?And if he did, was there any surely safe way?Steel's mind flickered lightly all around the issue as he watched the black frocked pack.Steel was used to playing for high stakes.He had been born playing for them.Fear and death and winning were his whole life.But never had the stakes been as high as now.Flenser had come close to subverting the largest nation on the continent, and had had dreams of ruling the world Lord Steel looked to the hillside across the straits, at the new castle he was building.In his present game, world conquest would follow easily on victory, and the destruction of the world was a conceivable consequence of failure.Steel had visited the flying ship shortly after the ambush.The ground was still steaming.Every hour it seemed to grow hotter.The mainland peasants talked of demons wakened in the earth; Steel's advisors could not do much better.The whitejackets needed padded boots to get close.Steel had ignored the steam, donned the boots, and walked beneath the curving hull.The bottom was vaguely like a boat's hull, if you ignored the stilts.Near the center was a teat like projection; the ground directly underneath burbled with molten rock.The burned out coffins were on the uphill side of the ship.Several of the corpses had been removed for dissection.In the first hours his advisors had been full of fanciful theories: the mantis folk were warriors fleeing a battle, come to bury their dead  So far no one had been able to take a careful look inside the craft.The gray stairs were made of something as strong as steel yet feather light.But they were recognizably stairs, even if the risers were high for the average member.Steel scrambled up the steps, leaving Shreck and his other advisors outside.He stuck a head through the hatch  and winced back abruptly.The acoustics were deadly.He understood what the whitejackets were complaining about.How could the aliens bear it?One by one he forced himself through the opening.Echoes screamed at him  worse than from unpadded quartz.He quieted himself, as he had so often done in the Master's presence.The echoes diminished, but they were still a horde raging in the walls all around.Not even his best whitejackets could tolerate more than five minutes here.The thought made Steel stand straighter.Discipline.Quiet does not always mean submission; it can mean hunting.He looked around, ignoring the howling murmurs.Light came from bluish strips in the ceiling.As his eyes adjusted, he could see what his people had described to him: the interior was just two rooms.He was standing in the larger one  a cargo hold?There was a hatch in the far wall and then the second room.The walls were seamless.They met in angles that did not match the outer hull; there would be dead spaces.A breeze moved fitfully about the room, but the air was much warmer than outside.He had never been in a place that felt more of power and evil.Surely it was only a trick of acoustics.They would bring in some absorbent quilts, some side reflectors, and the feeling would go away.Still  The room was filled with coffins, these unburned.The place stank with the aliens' body odor.Mold grew in the darker corners.In a way that was comforting: the aliens breathed and sweated as other living things, and for all their marvelous invention, they could not keep their own den clean.Steel wandered among the coffins.The boxes were mounted on railed racks.When the ones outside had been here, the room must have been crammed full.Undamaged, the coffins were marvels of fine workmanship.Warm air exited slots along the sides.He sniffed at it: complex, faintly nauseating, but not the smell of death.And not the source of the overpowering stench of mantis sweat that hung everywhere.Each coffin had a window mounted on its top side.What effort to honor the remains of single members!Steel hopped onto one and looked down.The corpse was perfectly preserved; in fact, the blue light made everything look frozen.He cocked a second head over the edge of the box, got a double view on the creature within.It was far smaller than the two they had killed under the ship.It was even smaller than the one they had captured.Some of Steel's advisors thought the small ones were pups, perhaps unweaned.It made sense; their prisoner never made thought sounds.Partly as an act of discipline, he stared for a long while at the alien's queer, flat face.The echo of his mind was a continuing pain, eating at his attention, demanding that he leave.Let the pain continue.He had withstood worse before, and the packs outside must know that Steel was stronger than any of them.He could master the pain and have the greater insight And then he would work their butts off, quilting these rooms and studying the contents.So Steel stared, almost thoughtless, into the face.The screaming in the walls seemed to fade a little.The face was so ugly.How could the creature eat?He had looked at the charred corpses outside, noticed their small jaws and randomly misshapen teeth.A few minutes passed; the noise and ugliness mixed together, dream like And out of his trance, Steel new a nightmare horror: The face moved.The change was small, and it happened very, very slowly.But over a period of minutes, the face had changed.Steel's fell from the coffin; the walls screamed back terror.For a few seconds, he thought the noise would kill him.Then he regained himself with quiet thought.He crawled back onto the box.All his eyes stared through the crystal, waiting like a pack on hunt The change was regular.The alien in the box was breathing, but fifty times more slowly than any normal member.He moved to another box, watched the creature in it.Somehow, they were all alive.Inside those boxes, their lives were simply slowed.He looked up from the boxes, almost in a daze.That the room reeked of evil was an illusion of sound and also the absolute truth.The mantis alien had landed far from the tropics, away from the collectives; perhaps it thought the Arctic Northwest a backward wilderness.It had come in a ship jammed with hundreds of mantis pups.These boxes were like larval casings: the pack would land, raise the small ones to adulthood  out of sight of civilization.Steel felt his pelts puff up as he thought about it.If the mantis pack had not been surprised, if Steel's troops had been any less aggressive it would have been the end of the world.Steel staggered to the outer hatch, his fears coming louder and louder off the walls.Even so, he paused a moment in the shadows and the screams.When his members trooped down the stairs, he moved calmly, every jacket neatly in place.Soon enough his advisors would know the danger, but they would never see fear in him.He walked lightly across the steaming turf, out from under the hull.But even he could not resist a quick look across the sky.This was one ship, one pack of aliens.It had had the misfortune of running into the Movement.Even so, its defeat had been partly luck.How many other ships would land, had already landed?Was there time for him to learn from this victory?Steel's mind returned to the present, to his eyrie lookout above the castle.That first encounter with the ship was many tendays past.There was still a threat, but now he understood it better, and  as was true of all great threats  it held great promise.On the rampart, Flenser in Waiting slid through the deepening twilight.Steel's eyes followed the pack as it walked beneath the torches, and one by one disappeared down stairs.There was an awful lot of the Master in that fragment; it had understood many things about the alien landing before anyone else.Steel took one last look across the darkening hills as he turned and started down the spiral stair.It was a long, cramped climb; the lookout sat atop a forty foot tower.The stair was barely fifteen inches wide, the ceiling less that thirty inches above the steps.Cold stone pressed in from all around, so close that there were no echoes to confuse thought  yet also so close that the mind was squeezed into a long thread.Climbing the spiral required a twisting, strung out posture that left any attacker easy prey for a defender in the eyrie.Such was military architecture.For Steel, crawling the cramped dark was pleasant exercise.The stairs opened onto a public hallway, ten feet across with back off nooks every fifty feet.Shreck and a bodyguard were waiting for him."I have the latest from Woodcarvers," said Shreck.He was holding sheets of silkpaper.Losing the other alien to Woodcarvers had once seemed a major blow.Only gradually had he realized how well it could work out.He had Woodcarvers infiltrated.At first he'd intended to have the other alien killed; it would have been easy to do.But the information that trickled north was interesting.There were some bright people at Woodcarvers.They were coming up with insights that had slipped past Steel and the Master  the fragment of the Master.So.In effect, Woodcarvers had become Steel's second alien laboratory, and the Movement's enemies were serving him like any other tool.The irony was irresistible."Very good, Shreck.Take it to my den.I'll be there shortly. "Steel waved the whitejackets into a back up nook and swept past him.Reading the report over brandy would be a pleasant reward for the day's work.In the meantime, there were other duties and other pleasures.The Master had begun building Hidden Island Castle more than a century earlier; it was growing yet.In the oldest foundations, where an ordinary ruler might put dungeons, were the Flenser's first laboratories.Many could be mistaken for dungeons  and were by their inhabitants.Steel reviewed all the labs at least once a tenday.Now he swept through the lowest levels.Crickers fled before the light of his guard's torches.There was a smell of rotting meat.Steel's paws skidded where slickness lay upon the stone.Holes were dug in the floor at regular intervals.Each could hold a single member, its legs jammed tight to its body.Each was covered by a lid with tiny air holes.It took the average member about three days to go mad in such isolation.The resulting "raw material" could be used to build blank packs.Generally, they weren't much more than vegetables, but then that was all the Movement asked of some.And sometimes remarkable things came from these pits: Shreck for instance.Shreck the Colorless, some called him.Shreck the stolid.A pack who was beyond pain, beyond desire.Shreck's was the loyalty of clockwork, but built from flesh and blood.He was no genius, but Steel would have given an eastern province for five more of him.And the promise of more such successes made Steel use the isolation pits again and again.He had recycled most of the wrecks from the ambush that way  Steel climbed back to higher levels, where the really interesting experiments were undertaken.The world regarded Hidden Island with fascinated horror.They had heard of the lower levels.But most didn't realize what a small part those dark spaces played in the Movement's science.To properly dissect a soul, you need more than benches with blood gutters.The results from the lower levels were simply the first steps in Flenser's intellectual quest.There were great questions in the world, things that had bothered packs for thousands of years.How do we think?Why do we believe?Why is one pack a genius and another an oaf?Before Flenser, philosophers argued them endlessly and never got closer to the truth.Even Woodcarver had pranced around the issues, unwilling to give up her traditional ethics.Flenser was prepared to get the answers.In these labs, nature itself was under interrogation.Steel walked across a chamber one hundred yards wide, with a roof supported by dozens of stone pillars.On every side there were dark partitions, slate walls mounted on tiny wheels.The cavern could be blocked off, maze like, into any pattern.Flenser had experimented with all the postures of thought.In the centuries before him, there had been only a few effective postures: the instinctive heads together, the ring sentry, various work postures.Flenser had tried dozens more: stars, double rings, grids.Most were useless and confusing.In the star, only a single member could hear all the others, and each of those could only hear the one.In effect, all thought had to pass through the hub member.The hub could contribute nothing rational, yet all its misconceptions passed uncorrected to the rest.Drunken foolishness resulted Of course, that experiment was reported to the outside world.But at least one of the others  still secret  worked strangely well: Flenser posted eight packs around the floor and on temporary platforms, blocked them from each another with the slate partitions, and then put members from each pack in connection with their counterparts in three others.In a sense, he created a pack of eight packs.Steel was still experimenting with that.If the connectors were sufficiently compatible (and that was the hard part), the resulting creature was far smarter than a ring sentry.In most ways it was not as bright as a single heads together pack, yet sometimes it had striking insights.Before he left for the Long Lakes, the Master had developed a plan to rebuild the castle's main hall so council sessions could be conducted in this posture.Steel hadn't pursued that idea; it seemed just a bit too risky.Steel's domination of others was not quite as complete as Flenser's had been.No matter.There were other, far more significant, projects.The rooms ahead were the true heart of the Movement.Steel's soul had been born in these rooms; all of Flenser's greatest creations had begun here.During the last five years, Steel had continued the tradition and improved upon it.He walked down the hall that linked the separate suites.Each bore its number in inlaid gold.At each he opened a door and stepped partway through.His staff left their report on the previous tenday just inside.Steel quickly read each one, then poked a nose over the balcony to look at the experiment within.The balconies were well padded, and screened; it was easy to observe without being seen.Flenser's one weakness (in Steel's opinion) was his desire to create the superior being.The Master's confidence was so immense, he believed that any such success could be applied to his own soul.Steel had no such illusions.It was a commonplace that teachers are surpassed by their creations  pupils, fission children, adoptions, whatever.He, Steel, was a perfect illustration of this, though the Master didn't know it yet.Steel had determined to create beings that would each be superior in some single way  while flawed and malleable in others.In the Master's absence, he had begun a number of experiments.Steel worked from scratch, identifying inheritance lines independent of pack membership.His agents purchased or stole pups that might have potential.Unlike Flenser, who usually melded pups into existing packs in an approximation of nature, Steel made his totally newborn.His puppy packs had no memories or fragments of soul; Steel had total control from the beginning.Of course, most such constructions quickly died.The pups had to be parted from their wet nurses before they began to participate in the adult's consciousness.The resulting pack was taught entirely in speech and written language.All inputs could be controlled.Steel stopped before door number thirty three: Experiment Amdiranifani, Mathematical Excellence.It was not the only attempt in this direction, but it was by far the most successful.Steel's agents had searched the Movement for packs with ability for abstraction.They had gone further: the world's most famous mathematician lived in the Long Lakes Republic.The pack had been preparing to fission; she had several puppies by herself and a mathematically talented lover.Steel had had the pups taken.They matched his other acquisitions so well that he decided to make an eightsome.If things worked out, it might be beyond all nature in its intelligence.Steel motioned his guard to shield the torches.He opened door thirty three and soft toed one member to the edge of the balcony.He looked down, carefully silencing that member's fore tympanum.The skylight was dim, but he could see the pups huddled together with its new friend.The mantis.Serendipity, that was all he could call this, the reward that comes to a researcher who labors long enough, carefully enough.He had had two problems.The first had been growing for a year: Amdiranifani was slowly fading, its members falling into the usual autism of wholly newborn packs.The second was the captured alien; that was an enormous threat, an enormous mystery, an enormous opportunity.How to communicate with it?Without communication, the possibilities for manipulation were very limited.Yet in a single blind stroke, an incompetent Servant had shown the way to solve both problems.Now that his eyes were adjusted to the dimness, Steel could see the alien beneath the pile of puppies.When first he'd heard that the creature had been put in with an experiment, Steel had been enraged beyond thought; the Servant who made the mistake had been recycled.But the days passed.Experiment Amdiranifani began showing more liveliness than any time since its pups were weaned.It quickly became obvious  from dissecting the other aliens, and observing this one  that mantis folk did not live in packs.Steel had a complete alien.The alien moved in its sleep, and made a low pitched mouth noise; it was totally incapable of any other kind of sound.The pups shifted to fit the new position.They were sleeping too, vaguely thinking among themselves.The low end of their sounds was a perfect imitation of the alien And that was the greatest coup of all.Experiment Amdiranifani was learning the alien's speech.To the pack of newborns this was simply another form of interpack talk, and apparently its mantis friend was more interesting than the tutors who appeared on these balconies.The Flenser Fragment claimed it was the physical contact, that the pups were reacting to the alien as a surrogate parent, thoughtless though the alien was.It really didn't matter.Steel brought another head to the edge of the balcony.He stood quietly, neither member thinking directly at the other.The air smelled faintly of puppies and mantis sweat.These two were the Movement's greatest treasure: the key to survival and more.By now, Steel knew the flying ship was not part of an invasion fleet.Their visitors were more like ill prepared refugees.There had been no word of other landings, and the Movement's spies were spread far.It had been a close thing, winning against the aliens.Their single weapon had killed most of a regiment.In the proper jaws, such weapons could defeat armies.He had no doubt the ship contained more powerful killing machines  ones that still functioned.Wait and watch, Steel counseled himself.Let Amdiranifani show the levers that could control this alien.The entire world would be the prize.Sometimes Mom used to say that something was "more fun than a barrel full of puppies. "Jefri Olsndot had never had more than one pet at a time, and only once had that been a dog.But now he understood what she meant.From the very first day, even when he had been so tired and scared, he had been entranced by the eight puppies.And they by him.They were all over him, pulling at his clothes, unfastening his shoes, sitting on his lap, or just running around him.Three or four were always staring at him.Their eyes were completely brown or pink, and seemed large for their heads.From the beginning the puppies had mimicked him.They were better than Straumli songbirds; anything he said, they could echo  or play back later.And when he cried, often the puppies would cry too, and cuddle around him.There were other dogs, big ones that wore clothes and entered the room through doorways high up on the walls.They lowered food into the room, sometimes making strange noises.But the food tasted awful, and they didn't respond to Jefri's screaming even by mimicking him.Two days had passed, then a week.Jefri had investigated everything in the room.It wasn't really a dungeon; it was too big.And besides, prisoners don't get pets.He understood that this world was uncivilized, not part of the Realm, perhaps not even on the Net.If Mom or Dad or Johanna weren't nearby, it was possible that there was no one here to teach the dogs to speak Samnorsk!Then it would be up to Jefri Olsndot to teach the dogs and find his family.Now when the white jacketed dogs came onto the corner balconies, Jefri shouted questions at them.It didn't help very much.Even the one with red stripes didn't respond.But the puppies did!They shouted right along with Jefri, sometimes echoing his words, sometimes making nonsense sounds.It didn't take Jefri long to realize that the puppies were driven by a single mind.When they ran around him, some would always sit a little way off, their graceful necks arching this way and that  and the runners seemed to know exactly what the others saw.He couldn't hide things behind his back if there was even one of them to alert the others.For a while he thought they were somehow talking to each other.But it was more than that: when he watched them unfasten his shoes or draw a picture  the heads and mouths and paws cooperated so perfectly, like the fingers on a person's hands.Jefri didn't reason things out so explicitly; but over a period of days he came to think of all the puppies together as a single friend.At the same time he noticed that the puppies was mixing up his words  and sometimes making new meanings."You me play. "The words came out like a cheap voice splice, but they generally preceded a mad game of tag all around the furniture."You me picture. "The slate board covered the lowest meter of the wall, all around the room.It was a display device like Jefri had never seen in his life: dirty, imprecise, imperfectly deletable, unstorable.Jefri loved it.His face and hands, and most of Puppies' lips, got covered with chalk stains.They drew each other, and themselves.Puppies didn't draw neat pictures like Jefri's; Puppies' dog figures had big heads and paws, with the bodies all smudged together.When he drew Jefri, the hands were always big, each finger carefully drawn.Jefri drew his family and tried to make Puppies understand.Day by day, the sunlight circled higher on the walls.Sometimes the room was dark now.At least once a day, packs came to talk to Puppies.This was one of the few things which could pull the little ones away from Jefri.Puppies would sit below the balconies, screeching and croaking at the adults.It was a school class!They'd lower scrolls for him to look at, and retrieve ones he had marked.Jefri sat quietly and watched the lessons.He fidgeted, but he didn't shout at the teachers anymore.Just a little longer, and he and Puppies would really be talking.Just a little longer and Puppies could find out for him where Mom and Dad and Johanna were.Sometimes terror and pain are not the best levers; deception, when it works, is the most elegant and the least expensive manipulation of all.Once Amdiranifani was fluent in the mantis language, Steel had him explain about the "tragic death" of Jefri's parents and brood sibling.The Flenser Fragment had argued against it, but Steel wanted quick and unquestioned control.Now it seemed that the Fragment might have been right; at least he should have held out the hope that the brood sibling lived.Steel looked solemnly at the Amdiranifani Experiment."How can we help?"The young pack looked up trustingly."Jefri is so terribly upset about his parents and sister. "Amdiranifani was using mantis words a lot, often unnecessarily: sister instead of brood sibling."He hasn't been eating much.He doesn't want to play.It makes me very sad. "Steel kept watch on the far balcony.The Flenser Fragment was there.It was not hiding, though most of its faces were out of the candlelight.So far its insights had been extraordinary.But the Fragment's stare was like old times, when a mistake could mean mutilation or worse.So be it.The stakes were higher now than ever before; if fear at Steel's throats could help him succeed, he welcomed it.He looked away from the balcony, and brought all his faces to an expression of tender sympathy for poor Jefri's plight."You just have to make it  him  understand.No one can bring his parents or sister back to life.But we know who the murderers are.We're doing everything we can to defend against them.Tell him how hard this is.Woodcarvers is an empire that has lasted hundreds of years.In a fight, we are no match for them.That's why we need all the help he can give us.We need him to teach us to use his parents' ship. "The puppy pack lowered a head."Yes.I'll try, but" The three members by Jefri made low pitched grunting noises at it.The mantis sat head bowed; it held its tentacled paws across its eyes.The creature had been like this for several days, and the withdrawal was getting worse.Now it shook its head violently, made sharp noises a little higher pitched than its normal register."Jefri says he doesn't understand how things work in the ship.He's just a little" the pack searched for a translation.  "he is really very young.You know, like me. "Steel nodded understandingly.It was an obvious consequence of the aliens' singleton nature, but weird even so: Every one of them started out all a puppy.Every one of them was like Steel's puppy pack experiments.Parental knowledge was transmitted by the equivalent of interpack speech.That made the creature easy to dupe, but it was a damned inconvenience now."Still, if there's anything he can help explain. "More grunting from the mantis.Steel should learn that language.The sounds were easy; these pitiful creatures used their mouths to talk, like a bird or a forest slug.For now he depended on Amdiranifani.For now that was okay; the puppy pack trusted him.Another piece of serendipity.With a few of his recent experiments, Steel had tried love in place of Flenser's original terror/love combination; there had been a slim chance that it might be superior.By great good luck Amdiranifani fell into the love group.Even his instructors had avoided negative reinforcement.The pack would believe anything he said and so, Steel hoped, would the mantis.Amdiranifani translated: "There is something else; he has asked me about it before.Jefri knows how to wake the other children  " the word literally meant "pack of puppies", " on the ship.You look surprised, my lord Steel?"Even though he no longer dreamed in terror of monster minds, Steel would just as soon not have a hundred more aliens running around."I hadn't realized they could be wakened so easily But we shouldn't do it right now.We're having trouble finding food that Jefri can eat. "That was true; the creature was an incredibly finicky eater."I don't think we could feed any more right now. "More grunting.More sharp cries from Jefri.Finally, "There is one other thing, my lord.Jefri thinks it may be possible to use the ship's ultrawave to call for help from others like his parents. "The Flenser Fragment jerked out of the shadows.A pair of heads looked down at the mantis, while another stared meaningfully at Steel.Steel didn't react; he could be cooler than any loose pack."That's something to think about.Perhaps you and Jefri could talk more about it.I don't want to try it till we're sure we won't hurt the ship. "That was weak.He saw the Fragment twitch a muzzle in amusement.As he spoke, Amdiranifani was translating.Jefri responded almost immediately."Oh, that's okay.He meant a special call.Jefri says the ship has been signaling all by itself ever since it landed. "And Steel wondered if he had ever heard a deadly threat uttered in such sweet innocence.They began letting Amdi and Jefri outside to play.Beforehand Amdi was nervous about going out.He was unused to wearing clothes.His whole life  all four years of it  had been spent in that one big room.He read about the outside and was curious about it, yet he was also a little afraid.But the human boy seemed to want it.Every day he'd been more withdrawn, his crying softer.Mostly he was crying for his parents or sister, but sometimes he cried about being locked up so deep away.So Amdi had talked to Mr.Steel, and now they got out almost every day, at least to an inner courtyard.At first, Jefri just sat, not really looking around.But Amdi discovered that he loved the outdoors, and every time he got his friend to play a little more.Packs of teachers and guards stood at the corners of the yellowing moss and watched.Amdi  and eventually Jefri  got a big kick out of harassing them.They hadn't realized it down in the room, where visitors came at the balconies, but most adults were nervous around Jefri.The boy was half again as tall as a normally standing pack member.When he came close, the average pack would clump together and edge away.They didn't like having to look up at him.It was silly, Amdi thought.Jefri was so tall and skinny, he looked like he might topple over at any moment.And when he ran it was like he was wildly trying to recover from a fall and never quite succeeding.So Amdi's favorite game those first days was tag.Whenever he was the chaser, he contrived to run Jefri right through the most prim looking whitejackets.If he and Jefri did it right they could turn the tag into a three way event, Amdi chasing Jefri and a whitejackets racing to stay away from both of them.Sometimes he felt sorry for the guards and whitejackets.They were so stiff and grownup.Didn't they understand how much fun it was to have a friend that you walk right next to, that you could actually touch?It was mostly night now.Daylight hovered for a few hours around noon.The twilight before and after was bright enough to dim the stars and aurora, but still too faint to show colors.Though Amdi had spent his life indoors, he understood the geometry of the situation, and liked to watch the change of light.Jefri didn't much like the dark of winter until the first snow fell.Amdi got his first set of jackets.And Mr.Steel had special clothes made for the human boy, big puffy things that covered his whole body and kept him warmer than a good pelt would have done.On one side of the courtyard the snow was just six inches deep, but elsewhere it piled into drifts higher than Amdi's head.Torches were mounted in wind shields on the walls; their light glittered golden off the snow.Amdi knew about snow  but he'd never seen it before.He loved to splash it on one of his jackets.He would stare and stare, trying to see the snowflakes without his breath melting them.The hexagonal pattern was tantalizing, just at the limit of his vision.But tag was no fun anymore; the human could run through drifts that left Amdi swimming in the white stuff.There were other things the human could do, wonderful things.He could make balls of snow and throw them.The guards were very upset by this, especially when Jefri plinked a few members.It was the first time he ever saw them get angry.Amdi raced around the windswept side of the courtyard, dodging snowballs and keening frustration.Human hands were such wicked, wicked things.How he would love to have a pair  four pairs!He circled round from three sides and sprinted right at the human.Jefri backed quickly into deeper snow, but too late.Amdi hit him high and low, tipping the Two Legs over into a snowdrift.There was a mock battle, slashing lips and paws against Jefri's hands and feet.But now Amdi was on top.The human got paid back for his snowballs with plenty of snow stuffed down the back of his jacket.Sometimes they just sat and watched the sky for so long that rumps and paws went numb.Sitting behind the largest snow drift, they were shaded from the castle torches and had a clear view of the lights in the sky.At first Amdi had been entranced by the aurora.Even some of his teachers were.They said this part of the world was one of the best places to see the sky glow.Sometimes it was so faint that the torchlight glimmering off the snow was enough to blot it out.Other times it ran from horizon to horizon: green light trimmed with hints of pink, twisting as though ruffled by a slow wind.He and Jefri could talk very easily now, though always in Jefri's language.The human couldn't make many of the sounds of interpack speech; even his pronunciation of Amdi's name was a scarcely recognizable.But Amdi understood Samnorsk pretty well; it was fun, their own secret language.Jefri was not especially impressed by the aurora."We have that lots at home.It's just light from  " He said a new word, and glanced at Amdi.It was funny how the human couldn't look in more than one place at time.His eyes and head were always moving.  "you know, places where people make things.I think the gas and waste leaks out, and then the sun lights it up or it gets  " unintelligible."Places where people make things?"In the sky?Amdi had a globe; he knew the size of the world and its orientation.If the aurora were reflecting sunlight, it must be hundreds of miles above the ground!Amdi leaned a back against Jefri's jacket and made a very human whistling sound.His knowledge of geography was not up to his geometry, but, "The packs don't work in the sky, Jefri.We don't even have flying boats. ""Uh, that's right, you don't I don't know what that stuff is then.But I don't like it.It gets in the way of the stars. "Amdi knew all about the stars; Jefri had told him.Somewhere out there were the friends of Jefri's parents.Jefri was silent for several minutes.He wasn't looking at the sky anymore.Amdi wriggled a little closer, watching the shifting light in the sky.Behind them the wind sharpened crest of the drift was edged with yellow light from the torches.Amdi could imagine what the other was thinking."The commsets from the boat, they really aren't good enough to call for help?"Jefri slapped the ground."No!I told you.They're just radio.I think I can make them work, but what's the use?The ultrawave stuff is still on the boat and it's too big to move.I just don't understand why Mr.Steel won't let me go aboard I'm eight years old, you know.I could figure it out.Mom had it all set up before, before" His words guttered into the familiar, despairing silence.Amdi rubbed a head against Jefri's shoulder.He had a theory about Mr.Steel's reluctance.It was an explanation he hadn't told Jefri before: "Maybe he's afraid you'll just fly away and leave us. ""That's stupid!I'd never leave you.Besides, that boat is real hard to fly.It was never meant to land on a world. "Jefri said the strangest things; sometimes Amdi was just misunderstanding  but sometimes they were literal truth.Did the humans really have ships that never came to ground?Where did they go then?Amdi could almost feel new scales of reference clicking together in his mind.Mr.Steel's geography globe represented not the world, but something very, very small in the true scheme of things."I know you wouldn't leave us.But you can see how Mr.Steel might be afraid.He can't even talk to you except through me.We have to show him that we can be trusted. ""I guess. ""If you and I could get the radios working, that might help.I know my teachers haven't figured them out.Mr.Steel has one, but I don't think he understands it either. ""Yeah.If we could get the other one to work"  That afternoon the guards got a break: their two charges came in from the cold early.The guards didn't question their good fortune.Steel's den had originally been the Master's.It was very different from the castle's meeting halls.Except for choirs, only a single pack would fit in any room.It was not exactly that the suite was small.There were five rooms, not counting the bath.But except for the library, none was more than fifteen feet across.The ceilings were low, less than five feet; there was no space for visitor balconies.Servants were always on call in the two hallways that shared a wall with the quarters.The dining room, bedroom, and bath had servant hatches, just big enough to give orders and to receive food and drink, or preening oils.The main entrance was guarded on the outside by three trooper packs.Of course, the Master would never live in a den with only one exit.Steel had found eight secret hatches (three in the sleeping quarters).These could only be opened from within; they led to the maze that Flenser had built within the solid rock of the castle's walls.No one knew the extent of that maze, not even the Master.Steel had rearranged parts of it  in particular the passages leading from this den  in the years since Flenser's departure.The quarters were nearly impregnable.Even if the castle fell, the rooms' larder was stocked for half a year; ventilation was provided by a network of channels almost as extensive as the Master's secret passages.All in all, Steel felt tolerably safe here.There was always the possibility that there were more than eight secret entrances, perhaps one that could be opened from the other side.And of course choirs were out of the question, here or anywhere.The only extrapack sex that Steel indulged was with singletons  and that as part of his experiments; it was just too dangerous to mix one's self with others.After dinner, Steel drifted into the library.He relaxed around his reading desk.Two of him sipped brandy while another smoked southern herbs.This was pleasure, but also calculation: Steel knew just what vices, applied to just which members, would raise his imagination to its keenest pitch.And more and more he was coming to see that imagination was at least as important as raw intelligence in the present game.The desk between him was covered with maps, reports from the south, internal security memos.But lying in all the silkpaper, like an ivory slug in its nest, was the alien radio.They had recovered two from the ship.Steel picked the thing up, ran a nose along the smooth, curved sides.Only the finest stressed wood could match its grace  and that in musical instruments or statuary.Yet the mantis claimed this could be used to talk across dozens of miles, as fast as a ray of sunlight.If true Steel wondered how many lost battles might have been won with these, and how many new conquests might be safely undertaken.And if they could learn to make far talkers the Movement's subordinates, scattered across the continent, would be as near as the guards by Steel's den.No force in the world could stand against them.Steel picked up the latest report from Woodcarvers.In many ways they were having more success with their mantis than Steel with his.Apparently theirs was almost an adult.More important, it had a miraculous library that could be interrogated almost like a living being.There had been three other datasets.Steel's whitejackets had found what was left of them in the burnt out wreckage around the ship.Jefri thought that the ship's processors were a little like a dataset, "only stupider" (Amdi's best translation), but so far the processors had been useless.But with their dataset, several on Woodcarver's staff had already learned mantis talk.Each day they discovered more about the aliens' civilization than Steel's people could in ten.He smiled.They didn't know that all the important stuff was being faithfully reported to Hidden Island For now he would let them keep their toy, and their mantis; they had noticed several things that would have slipped by him.Still he damned the luck.Steel paged through the report Good.The alien at Woodcarvers was still uncooperative.He felt his smile spreading into laughter: it was a small thing, the creature's word for the Packs.The report tried to spell out the word.It didn't matter; the translation was "claws" or "tines".The mantis had a special horror for the tine attachments that soldiers wore on their forepaws.Steel licked pensively at the black enamel of his manicured claws.Interesting.Claws could be threatening things, but they were also part of being a person.Tines were their mechanical extension, and potentially more frightening.It was the sort of name you might imagine for an elite killer force but never for all the Packs.After all, the race of packs included the weak, the poor, the kindly, the naive as well as persons like Steel and Flenser.It said something very interesting about mantis psychology that the creature picked tines as the characterizing feature of the Packs.Steel eased back from his desk and gazed at the landscape painted around the library's walls.It was a view from the castle towers.Behind the paint, the walls were lined with patterns of mica and quartz and fiber; the echoes gave a vague sense of what you might hear looking out across the stone and emptiness.Combination audiovisuals were rare in the castle, and this one was especially well done; Steel could feel himself relaxing as he stared at it.He drifted for a moment, letting his imagination roam.Tines.I like it.If that was the alien's image, then it was the right name for his race.His pitiful advisors  and sometimes even the Flenser Fragment  were still intimidated by the ship from the stars.No question, there was power in that ship beyond anything in the world.But after the first panic, Steel understood that the aliens were not supernaturally gifted.They had simply progressed  in the sense that Woodcarver made so much of  beyond the current state of his world's science.Certainly the alien civilization was a deadly unknown right now.Indeed, it might be capable of burning this world to a cinder.Yet the more Steel saw, the more he realized the intrinsic inferiority of the aliens: What a bizarre abortion they were, a race of intelligent singletons.Every one of them must be raised from nothing, like a wholly newborn pack.Memories could only be passed by voice and writing.Each creature grew and aged and even died as a whole.Despite himself, Steel shivered.He had come a long way from the first misconceptions, the first fears.For more than a thirty days now he'd been scheming to use the star ship to rule the world.The mantis said that ship was signaling others.That had reduced some of his Servants to incontinence.So.Sooner or later, more ships would arrive.Ruling the world was no longer a practical goal It was time to aim higher, at goals even the Master had never imagined.Take away their technical advantages and the mantis folk were such finite, fragile beings.They should be easy to conquer.Even they seemed to realize this.Tines, the creature calls us.So it will be.Some day Tines would pace between the stars and rule there.But in the years till then, life would be very dangerous.Like a newborn pup, all their potential could be destroyed by one small blow.The Movement's survival  the world's survival  would depend upon superior intelligence, imagination, discipline, and treachery.Fortunately, those had always been Steel's great strengths.Steel dreamed in the candlelight and haze Intelligence, imagination, discipline, treachery.Done right could the aliens be persuaded to eliminate all of Steel's enemies and then bare their throats to him?It was daring, almost beyond reason, but there might be a way.Jefri claimed he could operate the ship's signaler.By himself?Steel doubted it.The alien was thoroughly duped, but not especially competent.Amdiranifani was a different story.He was showing all the genius of his bloodlines.And the principles of loyalty and sacrifice his teachers drilled into him had taken hold, though he was a bit playful.His obedience didn't have the sharp edge that fear could bring.No matter.As a tool he was useful beyond all others.Amdiranifani understood Jefri, and seemed to understand the alien artifacts even better than the mantis did.The risk must be taken.He would let the two aboard the ship.They would send his message in place of the automatic distress signal.And what should that first message be?Word for word, it would be the most important, most dangerous thing any pack had ever said.Three hundred yards away, deep in the experiment wing, a boy and a pack of puppies came across an unexpected piece of good luck: an unlocked door, and a chance to play with Jefri's commset.The phone was more complex than some.It was intended for hospital and field work, for the remote control of devices as well as for voice talk.By trial and error, the two gradually narrowed the options.Jefri Olsndot pointed to numbers that had appeared on the side of the device."I think that means we're matched with some receiver. "He glanced nervously at the doorway.Something told him they really shouldn't be here."That's the same pattern as on the radio Mr.Steel took," said Amdi.Not even one of his heads was watching the door."I bet if we press it here, what we say will come out on his radio.Now he'll know we can help So what should we do?"Three of Amdi raced around the room, like dogs that couldn't keep their attention on the conversation.By now, Jefri knew this was the equivalent of a human looking away and humming as he thought.The angle of his gaze was another gesture, in this case a spreading and mischievous smile."I think we should surprise him.He is always so serious. ""Yeah. "Mr.Steel was pretty solemn.But then all the adults were.They reminded him of the older scientists at the High Lab.Amdi grabbed the radio and gave him a "just watch this" look.He nosed on the "talk" switch and sang a long ululation into the mike.It sounded only vaguely like pack speech.One of Amdi translated, next to Jefri's ear.The human boy felt giggles stealing up his throat.In his den, Lord Steel was lost in scheming.His imagination  loosed by herbs and brandy  floated free, playing with the possibilities.He was settled deep in velvet cushions, comfortable in the den's safety.The remaining candles shone faintly on the landscape mural, glinting from the polished furniture.The story he would tell the aliens, he almost had it now  The noise on his desk began as a small thing, submerged beneath his dreaming.It was mostly low pitched, but there were overtones in the range of thought, like slices of another mind.It was a presence, growing.Someone is in my den!The thought tore like Flenser's killing blade.Steel's members spasmed panic, disoriented by smoke and drink.There was a voice in the middle of the insanity.It was distorted, missing tones that any normal speech should have.It howled and quavered at him, "Lord Steel!Greetings from the Pack of Packs, the Lord God Almighty!"Part of Steel was already out the main hatch, staring wide eyed at his guards in the hallway beyond.The troopers' presence brought a bit of calm, and icy embarrassment.This is nonsense.He tipped a head to the alien device on his desk.The echoes were everywhere, but the sounds originated in the far talker There was no pack speech now, just the high pitched slices of sound, mindless warbling in the middle range of thought.Wait.Behind it all, faint and low there were the coughing grunts he recognized as mantis laughter.Steel rarely gave way to rage.It should be his tool, not his master.But listening to the laughter, and remembering the words Steel felt black bloodiness rising in first one member and then another.Almost without thought, he reached back and smashed the commset.It fell instantly silent.He glared at the guards ranged at attention in the hallway.Their mind noise was quiet with stifled fear.Someone would die for this.Mr.Steel met with Amdi and Jefri the day after their success with the radio.They had convinced him.They were moving to the mainland.Jefri would have his chance to call for rescue!Steel was even more solemn than usual; he made a big thing about how important it was to get help, to defend against another attack from the Woodcarvers.But he didn't seem angry about Amdi's little prank.Jefri breathed a quiet sigh of relief.Back home, Daddy would have tanned his hide for something like that.I guess Amdi is right.Mr.Steel was serious because of all his responsibilities and the dangers they faced.But underneath he was a very nice person.Crypto: 0  As received by: Transceiver Relay03 at Relay  Language path: Firetongue Cloudmark Triskweline, SjK

noticed the apparent extinction of three isolated civilizations in the High Beyond near Straumli Realm.Two of these were Eye in the U religious probes, and the third was a Pentragian factory.Previously their main Net link had been Straumli Realm.As such, they have been off the Net since Straumli dropped, except for occasional pinging from us.We diverted three missions to perform fly throughs.Signal reconnaissance revealed wideband communication that was more like neural control than local net traffic.Several new large structures were noted.All our vessels were destroyed before detailed information could be returned.Given the background of these settlements, we conclude that this is not the normal aftermath of a transcending.These observations are consistent with a Class Two attack from the Transcend (albeit a secretive one).The most obvious source would be the new Power constructed by Straumli Realm.We urge special vigilance to all High Beyond civilizations in

identifying itself as Arbitration Arts is now controlled by the Straumli Perversion.The Arts' recent advertisement of communications services is a deadly trick.In fact we have good evidence that the Perversion used sapient Net packets to invade and disable the Arts' defenses.Large portions of the Arts now appear to be under direct control of the Straumli Power.Parts of the Arts that were not infected in the initial invasion have been destroyed by the converted portions: Fly throughs show several stellifications.What can be done: If during the last thousand seconds, you have received any High Beyond protocol packets from "Arbitration Arts", discard them at once.If they have been processed (then chances are it is the Perversion who is reading this message and with a [broad smile]), then the processing site and all locally netted sites must be physically destroyed at once.We realize that this means the destruction of solar systems, but consider the alternative.You are under Transcendent attack.If you survive the initial peril (the next thirty hours or so), then there are obvious procedures that can give relative safety: Do not accept High Beyond protocol packets.At the very least, route all communications through Middle Beyond sites, with translation down to, and then up from, local trade languages.For the longer term: It's obvious that an extraordinarily powerful Class Two Perversion has bloomed in our region of the galaxy.For the next thirteen years or so, all advanced civilizations near us will be in great danger.If we can identify the background of the current perversion, we may discover its weaknesses and a feasible defense.Class Two Perversions all involve a deformed Power that creates symbiotic structures in the High Beyond  but there is enormous variety of origins.Some are poorly formed jokes told by Powers no longer on the scene.Others are weapons built by the newly transcendent and never properly disarmed.The immediate source of this danger is well documented: a species recently up from the Middle Beyond, Homo sapiens, founded Straumli Realm.We are inclined to believe the theory proposed in messages [], namely that Straumli researchers experimented with something in Shortcuts, and that the recipe was a self booting evil from an earlier time.One possibility: Some loser from long ago planted how to's on the Net (or in some lost archive) for the use of its own descendants.Thus, we are interested in any information related to Homo sapiens.The next day Amdi went on the longest trip of his young life.Bundled in windbreakers, they traveled down wide, cobbled streets to the straits below the castle.Mr.Steel led the way on a chariot cart drawn by three kherhogs.He looked marvelous in his red striped jackets.Guards dressed in white fur rolled along on either side, and the dour Tyrathect brought up the rear.The aurora was as brilliant as Amdijefri had ever seen, brighter in sum than the full moon above the northern horizon.Icicles grew down from buildings' eaves, sometimes all the way to the ground: glittering, green silver pillars in the light.Then they were on the boats, rowing across the straits.The water swept like chill black stone around the hulls.When they reached the other side, Starship Hill towered over them, higher than any castle could ever be.Every minute brought new visions, new worlds.It took half an hour to reach the top of that hill, even though their carts were pulled by Kherhogs, and nobody walked.Amdi looked in all directions, awed by the landscape that spread, aurora lit, below them.At first Jefri seemed just as excited, but as they reached the hilltop, he stopped looking around and hugged painfully hard at his friend.Mr.Steel had built a shelter around the starship.Inside, the air was still and a little warmer.Jefri stood at the base of the spidery stairs, looking up at the light that spilled from the ship's open doorway.Amdi felt him shivering."Is he frightened of his own flier?"asked Tyrathect.By now Amdi knew most of Jefri's fears, and understood most of the despair.How would I feel if Mr.Steel were killed?"No, not scared.It's the memories of what happened here. "Steel said gently, "Tell him we could come again.He doesn't have to go inside today. "Jefri shook his head at the suggestion, but couldn't answer right away."I've got to go on.I've got to be brave. "He started slowly up the stairs, stopping at each step to make sure that Amdi was still all with him.The puppies were split between concern for Jefri and the desire to rush madly into this wonderful mystery.Then they were through the hatch, and into Two Legs strangeness.Bright bluish light, air as warm as in the castle and dozens of mysterious shapes.They walked to the far side of the big room, and Mr.Steel stuck some heads in the entrance.His mind sounds echoed loudly around them."I've quilted the walls, Amdi, but even so, there isn't room for more than one of us in here. ""Y yes," there were echoes and Steel's mind sounded strangely fierce."It's up to you to protect your friend here, and let me know about everything you see. "He moved back so that just one head still looked in upon them."Yes.Yes!I will. "It was the first time anybody except Jefri had really needed him.Jefri wandered silently about the room full of his sleeping friends.He wasn't crying any more, and he wasn't in the silent funk that often held him.It was as if he couldn't quite believe where he was.He passed his hands lightly across the caskets, looked at the faces within.So many friends, thought Amdi, waiting to be wakened.What will they be like?"The walls?I don't remember this" said Jefri.He touched the heavy quilting that Steel had hung."It's to make the place sound better," said Amdi.He pulled at the flaps, wondering what was behind: Green wall, like stone and steel all at once and covered with tiny bumps and fingers of gray."What's this?"Jefri was looking over his shoulders."Ug.Mold.It's spread.I'm glad Mr.Steel has covered it up. "The human boy drifted away.Amdi stayed a second longer, poked several heads up close to the stuff.Mold and fungus were a constant problem in the castle; people were always cleaning it up  and perversely so, in Amdi's opinion.He thought fungus was neat, something that could grow on hardest rock.And this stuff was especially strange.Some of the clumps were almost half an inch high, but wispy, like solid smoke.The back looking part of him saw that Jefri had drifted off toward the inner cabin.Reluctantly, Amdi followed.They stayed in the ship only an hour that first time.In the inner cabin Jefri turned on magic windows that looked out in all directions.Amdi sat goggle eyed; this was a trip to heaven.For Jefri it was something else.He hunched down in a hammock and stared at the controls.The tension slowly left his face."I  I like it here," said Amdi, tentatively, softly.Jefri rocked gently in the hammock.  "Yes. "He sighed."I was so afraid but being here makes me feel closer to" His hands reached out to caress the panel that hung close to the hammock."My dad landed this thing; he was sitting right here. "He twisted around, looked at a glimmering panel of light above him."And Mom got the ultrawave all set They did it all.And now it's only you and me, Amdi.Even Johanna is gone It's all up to us. "Vrinimi Classification: Organizational SECRET.Not for distribution beyond Ring 1 of the local net.Transceiver Relay00 search log:  Beginning 19:40:40 Docks Time, 17/01 of Org year 52090 [128.13 days since the fall of Straumli Realm]  Link layer syntax 14 message loop detected on assigned surveillance bearing.Signal strength and S/N compatible with previously detected beacon signal.Language path: Samnorsk, SjK:Relay units  From: Jefri Olsndot at I dont know where this is  Subject: Hello.My names Jefri Olsndot.Our ships hurt adnd we need help.pPlease anser.Summary: Sorry if I get some of this wrong.This keybord is STUPID!!Key phrases: I dont know  To: Relay anybody    Text of message: [empty]    Two Skroderiders played in the surf."Do you think his life is in danger?"asked the one with the slender green stalk."Whose life?"said the other, a large rider with a bluish basal shell."Jefri Olsndot, the human child. "Blueshell sighed to himself and consulted his skrode.You come to the beach to forget the cares of the everyday, but Greenstalk would not let them go.He scanned for danger to Jefri: "Of course he's in danger, you twit!Look up the latest messages from him. ""Oh. "Greenstalk's tone was embarrassed."Sorry for the partial remembering," remembering enough to worry and nothing more.She went silent; after a moment he heard her pleasured humming.The surf crashed endlessly past them.Blueshell opened to the water, tasting the life that swirled in the power of the waves.It was a beautiful beach.It was probably unique  and that was an extreme thing to say about anything in the Beyond.When the foam swept back from their bodies, they could see indigo sky spread from one side of the Docks to the other, and the glint of starships.When the surf came forward, the two Riders were submerged in the turbid chill, surrounded by the coralesks and intertidal creatures that built their little homes here.And at high "tide" the flexure of the sea floor held steady for an hour or so.Then the water cleared, and if in daylight, they could see patches of glassy sea bottom and through them, a thousand kilometers below, the surface of Groundside.Blueshell tried to clear his mind of care.For every hour of peaceful contemplation, a few more natural memories would accumulate No good.Just now he could no more banish the worries than could Greenstalk.After a moment, he said, "Sometimes I wish I were a Lesser Rider. "To stand a lifetime in one place, with just a minimum skrode."Yes," said Greenstalk."But we decided to roam.That means giving up certain things.Sometimes we must remember things that happen only once or twice.Sometimes we have great adventures: I'm glad we took the rescue contract, Blueshell. "So neither of them were really in the mood for the sea today.Blueshell lowered the skrode's wheels and rolled a little closer to Greenstalk.He looked deep into his skrode's mechanical memory, scanning the general databases.There was a lot there about catastrophes.Whoever created the original skrode databases had considered wars and blights and perversion very important.They were exciting things, and they could kill you.But Blueshell could also see that in relative terms, such disasters were a small part of the civilized experience.Only about once in a millennium was there a massive blight.It was their bad luck to be caught near such a thing.In the last ten weeks a dozen civilizations in the High Beyond had dropped from the Net, absorbed into the symbiotic amalgam that now was called the Straumli Blight.High trade was crippled.Since their ship was refinanced, he and Greenstalk had flown several jobs, but all to the Middle Beyond.The two of them had been very cautious, but now  as Greenstalk said  greatness might be thrust upon them.Vrinimi Org wanted to commission a secret flight to the Bottom of the Beyond.Since he and Greenstalk were already in on the secret, they were the natural choice for the job.Right now, the Out of Band II was in the Vrinimi yards getting bottom lugger enhancements and a huge stock of antenna drones.In one stroke the OOB's value was increased ten thousand fold.There had been no need even to bargain!and that was the scariest thing of all.Every addition was a clear essential for the trip.They would be descending right to the edge of the Slowness.Under the best of circumstances this would be slow and tedious exercise, but the latest surveys reported movement in the zone boundaries.With bad luck, they might actually end up on the wrong side, where light had the ultimate speed.If that should happen, the new ramscoop would be their only hope.All that was within Blueshell's range of acceptable business.Before he met Greenstalk, he had shipped on bottom luggers, even been stranded once or twice.But  "I like adventure as much as you," said Blueshell, a grumpy edge creeping into his voice."Traveling to the Bottom, rescuing sophonts from the claws of wildthings: given enough money, it's all perhaps reasonable.But what if that Straumer ship is really as important as Ravna thinks?After all this time it seems absurd, but she's convinced Vrinimi Org of the possibility.If there's something down there that could harm the Straumli Blight  " If the Blight ever suspected the same, it could have a fleet of ten thousand warships descending on their goal.Down at the Bottom they might be little better than conventional vessels, but he and Greenstalk would be no less dead for that.Except for a faint daydreamy hum, Greenstalk was silent.Had she had lost track of the conversation?Then her voice came to him through the water, a reassuring caress."I know, Blueshell, it could be the end of us.But I still want to venture it.If it's safe, we make enormous profit.If our going could harm the Blight well, then it's terribly important.Our help might save dozens of civilizations  a million beaches of Riders, just in passing. ""Hmpf.You're following stalk and not skrode. ""Probably. "They had watched the progress of the Blight since its beginning.The feelings of horror and sympathy had been reinforced every day till they percolated into their natural minds.So Greenstalk (and Blueshell too; he couldn't deny it) felt stronger about the Blight than about the danger in their new contract."Probably.My fears of making the rescue are still analytical," still confined to her skrode."Yet I think if we could stand here a year, if we could wait till we truly felt all the issues   I think we would still choose to go. "Blueshell rolled irritably back and forth.The grit swirled up and through his fronds.She was right, she was right.But he couldn't say it aloud; the mission still terrified him."And think, mate: If it is this important, then perhaps we can get help.You know the Org is negotiating with the Emissary Device.With any luck we'll end up with an escort designed by a Transcendental Power. "The image almost made Blueshell laugh.Two little Skroderiders, journeying to the Bottom of the Beyond  surrounded by help from the Transcend."I will hope for it. "The Skroderiders were not the only ones with that wish.Further up the beach, Ravna Bergsndot prowled her office.What gruesome irony that even the greatest disasters can create opportunities for decent people.Her transfer to Marketing had been made permanent with the fall of Arbitration Arts.As the Blight spread and High Beyond markets collapsed, the Org became ever more interested in providing information services about the Straumli Perversion.Her "special" expertise in things human suddenly became extraordinarily valuable  never mind that Straumli Realm itself was only a small part of what was now the Blight.What little the Blight said of itself was often in Samnorsk.Grondr and company continued to be vitally interested in her analysis.Well, she had done some good.They had picked up the refugee ship's "I am here", and then  ninety days later  a message from a human survivor, Jefri Olsndot.Barely forty messages had they exchanged, but enough to learn about the Tines and Mr.Steel and the evil Woodcarvers.Enough to know that a small human life would be ended if she could not help.Ironic but natural: most times that single life weighed more on her than all the horror of the Perversion, even the fall of Straumli Realm.Thank the Powers that Grondr had endorsed the rescue mission: It was a chance to learn something important about the Straumli Perversion.And the Tinish packs seemed to interest him, too; group minds were a fleeting thing in the Beyond.Grondr had kept the whole affair secret, and persuaded his bosses to support the mission.But all his help might not be enough.If the refugee ship was as important as Ravna thought, there could be enormous perils awaiting any rescuers.Ravna looked across the surf.When the waves backed down the sand, she could see the Skroderiders' fronds peeping out of the spray.How she envied them; if tensions annoyed them, they could simply turn them off.The Skroderiders were one of the most common sophonts in the Beyond.There were many varieties, but analysis agreed with legend: very long ago they had been one species.Somewhere in the off Net past, they had been sessile dwellers of sea shores.Left to themselves, they had developed a form of intelligence almost devoid of short term memory.They sat in the surf, thinking thoughts that left no imprints on their minds.Only repetition of a stimulus, over a period of time, could do that.But the intelligence and memory that they had was of survival value: it made it possible for them to select the best possible place to cast their pupal seeds, locations that would mean safety and food for the next generation.Then some unknown race had chanced upon the dreamers and decided to "help" them out.Someone had put them on mobile platforms, the skrodes.With wheels they could move along the seashores, could reach and manipulate with their fronds and tendrils.With the skrode's mechanical short term memory, they could learn fast enough that their new mobility would not kill them.Ravna glanced away from the Skroderiders  someone was floating in over the trees.The Emissary Device.Maybe she should call Greenstalk and Blueshell out of the water.No.Let'em bliss out a little longer.If she couldn't get the special equipment, things would be tough enough for them later  Besides, I can do without witnesses.She folded her arms across her chest and glared into the sky.The Vrinimi Org had tried to talk to the Old One about this, but nowadays the Power would only work through its Emissary Device and he had insisted on a face to face meeting.The Emissary touched down a few meters away, and bowed.His lopsided grin spoiled the effect."Pham Nuwen, at your service. "Ravna gave a little bow in return, and led him to the shade of her inner office.If he thought that face to face would unnerve her, he was right."Thanks for the meeting, sir.The Vrinimi Organization has an important request of your principal," owner?master?operator?Pham Nuwen plunked himself down, stretching indolently.He'd stayed out of her way since that night at The Wandering Company.Grondr said Old One had kept him at Relay though, rummaging through the archives for information about humanity and its origins.It made sense now that Old One had been persuaded to restrict Net use: the Emissary could do local processing, i. e. , use human intelligence to search and summarize and then upload only the stuff that Old One really needed.Ravna watched him out of the corner of her eye as she pretended to study her dataset.Pham had his old, lazy smile.She wondered if she would ever have the courage to ask him how much of their affair had been a human thing.Had Pham Nuwen felt anything for her?Hell, did he even have a good time?From a Transcendent point of view, he might be a simple data concentrator and waldo  but from her viewpoint he was still too human."Um, yes.Well the Org has continued to monitor the Straumli refugee ship even though your principal has lost interest. "Pham's eyebrows raised in polite interest."Oh?""Ten days ago, the simple 'I am here' signal was interrupted by a new message, apparently from a surviving crewmember. ""Congratulations.You managed to keep it a secret, even from me. "Ravna didn't rise to the bait."We're doing our best to keep it secret from everyone, sir.For reasons that you must know. "She put the messages to date on the air between them.A handful of calls and responses, scattered across ten days.Translated into Triskweline for Pham, the original spelling and grammar errors were gone, yet the tone remained.Ravna was responsible for the Org side of the conversation.It was like talking to someone in a dark room, someone you have never seen.Much was easy to imagine: a strident, piping voice behind the capitalized words and exclamation marks.She had no video of the child, but through the humankind archive at Sjandra Kei, Marketing had dug up pictures of the boy's parents.They looked like typical Straumers, but with the brown eyes of the Linden clans.Little Jefri would be slim and dark.Pham Nuwen's gaze flicked down through the text, then seemed to hang on the last few lines:     Org[17]: How old are you, Jefri?Target[18]: I am eight.I mean I am eight years old.I AM OLD ENOUGH    BUT I NEED HELP.Org[18]: We will help.We are coming as fast as we can, Jefri.Target[19]: Sorry I couldn't talk yesterday.The bad people were on the hill again yesterday.It wasn't safe to go to the ship.Org[19]: Are the bad ones that close by?Target[20]: Yes yes.I could see them from the island.I'm with Amdi on shipboard now, but walking up here there were dead soldiers all around.Woodcarver raids here often.Mother is dead.Father is dead.Johanna is dead.Mister Steel will protect me as much as he can.He says that I must be brave.For a moment, his smile was gone."Poor kid," he said softly.Then he shrugged and jabbed his hand at one of the messages."Well, I'm glad Vrinimi is sending a rescue mission.That is generous of you. ""Not really, sir.Look at items six through fourteen.The boy is complaining about the ship's automation. ""Yeah, he makes it sound like something out of a dawn age: keyboards and video, no voice recognition.A completely unfriendly interface.Looks like the crash scragged almost everything, eh?"He was being deliberately obtuse, but Ravna resolved to be infinitely patient."Perhaps not, considering the vessel's origin. "Pham just smiled, so Ravna continued to spell things out."The processors are likely High Beyond or Transcendent, snuffed down to near brainlessness by the current environment. "Pham Nuwen sighed."All consistent with the Skroderiders' theory, right?You're still hoping this crate is carrying some tremendous secret that will blow the Blight away. ""Yes!Look.At one time, the Old One was very curious about all this.Why the total disinterest now?Is there some reason why the ship can't be the key to fighting the Perversion?"That was Grondr's explanation for the Old One's recent lack of interest.All her life Ravna Bergsndot had heard tales of the Powers, and always from a great remove.Here, she was awfully close to questioning one directly.It was a very strange feeling.After a moment Pham said, "No.It's unlikely, but you could be right. "Ravna let out a breath she hadn't realized she'd been holding."Good.Then what we're asking is reasonable.Suppose the downed ship contains something the Perversion needs, or something it fears.Then it's likely the Perversion knows of its existence  and may even be monitoring ultradrive traffic in that part of the Bottom.A rescue expedition could lead the Perversion right to it.In that case, the mission will be suicide for its crew  and could increase the Blight's overall power. ""So?"Ravna slapped her dataset, resolutions of patience dissolving."So, Vrinimi Org is asking Old One's help to build an expedition the Blight can't knock over!"Pham Nuwen just shook his head."Ravna, Ravna.You're talking about an expedition to the Bottom of the Beyond.There's no way a Power can hold your hand down there.Even an Emissary Device would be mostly on its own there. ""Don't act like more of a jerk than you are, Pham Nuwen.Down there, the Perversion will be at just as much a disadvantage.What we're asking for is equipment of Transcendent manufacture, designed for those depths, and provided in substantial quantities. ""Jerk?"Pham Nuwen drew himself up, but there was still the ghost of smile on his face."Is that how you normally address a Power?"Before this year, I would have died rather than address a Power in any manner.She leaned back, giving him her own version of an indolent smile."You have a pipeline to god, Mister, but let me tell you a little secret: I can tell whether it's open or closed. "Polite curiosity: "Oh?How is that?""Pham Nuwen  left on his own  is a bright, egotistical guy, and about as subtle as a kick in the head. "She thought back to their time together."I don't really start worrying until the arrogance and smart remarks go away. ""Um.Your logic is a little weak.If the Old One were running me direct, he could just as easily play a jerk as," he cocked his head, "as the man of your dreams. "Ravna gritted her teeth."That's true, but I've got a little help from my boss.He's cleared me to monitor transceiver usage. "She looked at her dataset."Right now, your Old One is getting less than ten kilobits per second from all of Relay which means, my friend, that you are not being tele operated.Any crass behavior I see today is the true Pham Nuwen. "The redhead chuckled, faint embarrassment evident."You got me.I'm on detached duty, have been ever since the Org persuaded Old One to back off.But I want you to know that all those ten Kbps are dedicated to this charming conversation. "He paused as if listening, then waved his hand."Old One says 'hi'. "Ravna laughed despite herself; there was something absurd about the gesture, and the notion that a Power would indulge such trivial humor."Okay.I'm glad he can, um, sit in.Look, Pham, we're not asking for much by Transcendent standards, and it could save whole civilizations.Give us a few thousand ships; robot oneshots would be fine. ""Old One could make that many, but they wouldn't be much better that what's built down here.Tricking  " he paused, looking surprised by his own choice of words, "tricking the Zones is subtle work. ""Fine.Quality or quantity.We'll settle for whichever the Old One thinks  "  "No. ""Pham!We're talking about a few days work for the Old One.It's already paid more to study the Blight. "Their single wild evening might have cost as much  but she didn't say that."Yes, and Vrinimi has spent most of it. ""Paying off the customers you stepped on!Pham, can't you at least tell us why?"The lazy smile faded from his face.She took a quick glance at her dataset.No, Pham Nuwen was not possessed.She remembered the look on his face when he read the mail from Jefri Olsndot; there was a decent human being lurking behind all the arrogance."I'll give it a try.Keep in mind  even though I've been part of Old One  I'm remembering and explaining with human limitations."You're right, the Perversion is chewing up the Top of the Beyond.Maybe fifty civilizations will die before this Power gets tired of screwing around  and for a couple of thousand years after that there'll be 'echoes' of the disaster, poisoned star systems, artificial races with bloody minded ideas.But  I hate to say it this way  so what?Old One has been thinking about this problem, off and on, for more than a hundred days.That's a long time for a Power, especially Old One.He's existed for more than ten years now; his minds are drifting fast toward changes that will put him beyond all communication.Why should he give a damn about this?"It was a standard topic in school, but Ravna couldn't help herself.This time it was for real."But history is full of incidents where Powers helped Beyonder races, sometimes even individuals. "She had already looked up the Beyonder race that created Old One.They were gasbag creatures.Their netmail was mostly jabberwocky even after Relay's best interpretation.Apparently they had no special leverage with Old One.The direct appeal was about all she had."Look.Turn the thing around: Even ordinary humans don't need special explanation to help animals that are hurting. "Pham's smile was beginning to come back."You're so big on analogies.Remember that no analogy is perfect, and the more complex the automation the more complex the possible motivations.But okay, how about this for an analogy: Old One is a basically decent guy, with a nice home in a good part of town.One day he notices he has a new neighbor, a scruffy fellow whose homestead is awhiff with toxic sludge.If you were Old One, you'd be concerned, right?You might probe around beneath your properties.You'd also chat with the new fellow and check on where he came from, try to figure out what's going on.The Vrinimi Org saw part of that investigation."So you discover the new neighbor is unwholesome.Basically his lifestyle involves poisoning swamp land and eating the sludge produced.That's an annoyance: it smells and it hurts a lot of harmless animals.But, after investigating, it's clear the damage will not affect your own property, and you get the neighbor to take measures to reduce the stink.In any case, eating toxic sludge is a self defeating lifestyle. "He paused."As analogies go, I think this one's pretty good.After some initial mystery, Old One has determined that this Perversion is one of the common patterns, so petty and banal that even creatures like you and I can see it's evil.In one form or another, it's been drifting up from Beyonder archives for a hundred million years. ""Damn it!I'd get my neighbors together, and run the pervert out of town. ""That's been talked about, but it would be expensive and real people might get hurt. "Pham Nuwen came smoothly to his feet, and smiled dismissingly at her."Well, that's about all we had to say to you. "He walk out from under the trees.Ravna hopped up to pursue."My personal advice: don't take this so hard, Ravna.I've seen it all, you know.From the Bottom of the Slowness to the inside of a Transcendent Power, each Zone has its own special unpleasantness.The whole basis of the Perversion  thermodynamic, economic, however you want to picture it  is the high quality of thought and communication at the Top of the Beyond.The Perversion hasn't touched a single civilization in the Middle Beyond.Down here, the comm lags and expense are too great, and even the best equipment is mindless.To run things here you'd need standing navies, secret police, clumsy transceivers  it would be almost as awkward as any other Beyonder empire, and of no profit to a Power. "He turned and saw her dark expression."Hey, I'm saying your pretty ass is safe. "He reached down to pat her rear.Ravna brushed the hand away and stepped back.She'd been working on some clever argument that might set the guy to thinking; there were cases where Emissary Devices had changed their principal's decision.Now the half formed ideas were blown away, and all she could think to say was  "So how safe is your own tail, hmm?You say Old One is about ready to pack it in, go wherever overage Powers wander off to.Is he going to take you along, or maybe just put you away, a pet that's now inconvenient?"It was a silly shot, and Pham Nuwen just laughed."More analogies?No   most likely he'll just leave me behind.You know, like a robot probe flying free after its last use. "Another analogy, but one to his liking."In fact, if it happens soon enough, I might even be willing to take on this rescue expedition.It looks like Jefri Olsndot is in a medieval civlization.I'll wager there's no one in the Org who understands such a place better than I.  And down at the Bottom, your crew could scarcely ask for a better mate than an old Qeng Ho type. "He spoke breezily, as though courage and experience were givens for him  even if other people were cowardly scuts."Oh, yeah?"Ravna's arms went akimbo, and she cocked her head to one side.It was just a bit too much, when his whole existence was a fraud."You're the little prince who grew up with intrigue and assassination, and then flew away to the stars with the Qeng Ho Do you ever really think about that past, Pham Nuwen?Or is that something Old One tactfully blocks you from doing?After our charming evening at The Wandering Company, I did think about it.You know what?There's only a few things you can know for sure: You really were a Slow Zone spacer  probably two or three spacers, since none of the corpses was complete.Somehow you and your buddies got yourselves killed down at the nether end of the Slowness.What else?Well, your ship had no recoverable memory.The only hardcopy we found seemed to be written in some Earth Asian language.That's all, all, that Old One had to go on when he put together the fraud. "Pham's smile seemed a little frozen.Ravna went on before he could speak."But don't blame Old One.He was a little rushed, right?He had to convince Vrinimi and me that you were real.He rummaged around in the archives, slapped together a mishmash reality for you.Maybe it took him an afternoon  are you grateful for the effort?A snip from here and a snip from there.There really was a Qeng Ho, you know.On Earth, a thousand years before space flight.And there must have been Asia descended colonies, though that's an obvious extrapolation on his part.Old One really has a nice sense of humor.He made your whole life a fantastic romance, right down to the last tragic expedition.That should have tipped me off, by the way.It's a combination of several pre Nyjoran legends. "She caught her breath and rushed on."I feel sorry for you, Pham Nuwen.As long as you don't think about yourself too hard, you can be the most confident fellow in space.But all the skill, all the achievement  do you ever look at it up close?I'll bet not.Being a great warrior or an expert pilot  those involve a million subskills, all the way down to kinesthetic things below the level of conscious thought.The Old One's fraud needed just the top level recollections, and a brash personality.Look under the surface, Pham.I think you'll find a whole lot of nothing. "A dream of competence, too closely confronted.The redhead had crossed his arms and was tapping his sleeve with a finger.When she finally ran out of words, his smile grew broad and patronizing."Ah, silly Ravna.Even now you don't understand how far superior the Powers are.Old One is not some Middle Beyond tyranny, brainwashing its victims with superficial memories.Even a Transcendent fraud has more depth than the image of reality in a human mind.And how can you know this really is a fraud?So you looked through the Relay archives, and didn't find my Qeng Ho. "My Qeng Ho.He paused.Remembering?Trying to remember?For an instant Ravna saw a gleam of panic on his face.Then it was gone, and there was just the lazy smile."Can any of us imagine the archives of the Transcend, all the things Old One must know about humanity?Vrinimi Org should be grateful to Old One for explaining my origins; they could never have learned that by themselves."Look.I am truly sorry I can't help.Even if it's otherwise a fool's errand, I'd like to see those kids rescued.But don't worry about the Blight.It's near maximum expansion now.Even if you could destroy it, you wouldn't make things better for the poor wights who've been absorbed. "He laughed, a little too loudly."Well, I have to go; Old One has some other errands for me this afternoon.He wasn't happy about this being face to face, but I insisted.The perks of detached duty, y'know.You and I   you and I had some good times, and I thought it would be nice to chat.I didn't mean to make you mad. "Pham cut in his agrav and floated off the sand.He waved a laconic salute.Staring up, Ravna lifted her hand to wave back.His figure dwindled, acquired a faint nimbus as he left the Docks' breathable atmosphere and his space suit cut in.Ravna watched a few moments more, till the figure became one more commuter in the indigo sky.Damn.Damn.Damn.Behind her there was the sound of wheels crunching across sand.Blueshell and Greenstalk had rolled out of the water.Wetness glistened on the sides of their skrodes, transforming their cosmetic stripes into jagged rainbows.Ravna walked down to meet them.How do I tell them there's no help coming?With someone like Pham Nuwen fronting for it, Old One had seemed so different from what she imagined in her classes back at Sjandra Kei.She'd almost thought she could make a difference just by talking.What a joke.She had caught a glimpse just now, behind the front: of a being who could play with souls the way a programmer plays with a clever graphic, a being so far beyond her that only its indifference could protect her.Be happy, little Ravna moth.You were only dazzled by the flame.The next few weeks went surprisingly well.Despite the Pham Nuwen debacle, Blueshell and Greenstalk were still willing to fly the rescue.Vrinimi Org even kicked in some extra resources.Every day, Ravna took a tele excursion out to the repair yards.The Out of Band II might not be getting any Transcendent enhancements, but when the refitting was complete, the ship would be something extraordinary: Now it floated in a golden haze of structors, billions of tiny robots regrowing sections of the hull into the characteristic form of a bottom lugger.Sometimes the ship seemed to Ravna like a fragile moth and sometimes an abyssal fish.The rebuilt ship could survive across a range of environments: It had the spines of an ultradrive craft, but the hull was streamlined and wasp waist  the classic form of a ramscoop ship.Bottom luggers must troll dangerously near the Slow Zone.The zone surface was hard to detect from a distance, even harder to map; and there were short term position changes.It was not impossible for a lugger to be trapped a light year or two within the Slowness.It was then you'd thank goodness for the ramscoop and the coldsleep facilities.Of course, by the time you returned to civilization, you might be completely out of date, but at least you could get back.Ravna floated her viewpoint through the drive spines that spread out from the hull.They were broader than on most ships that came to Relay.They weren't optimal for the Middle or High Beyond, but with appropriate (i. e. , Low Beyond) computers, the ship would fly as fast as anything when it reached the Bottom.Grondr let her spend half time on the project, and after a few days Ravna realized this was not just a favor.She was the best person for this job.She knew humans, and she knew archive management.Jefri Olsndot needed reassurance every day.And the things Jefri was telling her were immediately important.Even if everything went according to plan  even if the Perversion stayed completely out of it  this rescue was going to be tricky.The kid and his ship seemed to be in the middle of a bloody war.Extracting them would mean making instantly correct decisions and acting on them.They would need an effective onboard database and strategy program.But not much could be expected to work at the Bottom, and memory capacity would be limited.It was up to Ravna to decide what library materials to move to the ship, to balance the ease of local availability against the greater resources that would be accessible over the ultrawave from Relay.Grondr was available on the local net, and often in real time.He wanted this to work: "Don't worry, Ravna.We'll dedicate part of R00 to this mission.If their antenna swarm works properly, the Riders should have have a thirty Kbps link to Relay.You'll be their prime contact here, and you'll have access to our best strategists.If nothing interferes, you should have no trouble managing this rescue. "Even four weeks ago, Ravna wouldn't have dared to ask for more.Now: "Sir, I have a better idea.Send me with the Skroderiders. "All of Grondr's mouth parts clapped together at once.She'd seen that much surprise in people like Egravan, but never in the staid Grondr.He was silent for a moment."No.We need you here.You are our best sanity check when it comes to questions about humankind. "The newsgroups interested in the Straumli Perversion carried more than one hundred thousand messages a day, about a tenth of that human related.Thousands of messages were old ideas rehashed, or patent absurdities, or probable lies.Marketing's automation was fairly good at filtering out the redundancy and some of the absurdity, but when it came to questions on human nature Ravna was without equal.About half her time was spent guiding that analysis and handling queries about humankind at the archives.All that would be next to impossible if she left with the Skroderiders.Over the next few days, Ravna kept pushing her boss on the question.Whoever flew the rescue would need instant rapport with humans  human children, in fact.Very likely Jefri Olsndot had never even met a Skroderider.The point was a good one, and it was gradually driving her to desperation  but by itself it would not have changed old Grondr's mind.It took some outside events to do that: As the weeks passed, the Blight's expansion slowed.Just as conventional wisdom (and Old One via Pham Nuwen) claimed, there seemed to be natural limits to how far the Perversion could extend its interests.The abject panic slowly disappeared from High Beyond communication traffic.Rumors and refugees from the absorbed volumes dribbled toward zero.The people in the Blighted spaces were gone, but now it was more like death in a graveyard than death from contagious rot.Blight related newsgroups continued to babble about the catastrophe, but the level of nonproductive rehashing was steadily increasing.There simply was very little new going on.Over the next ten years, physical death would spread through the Blighted region.Colonization would begin again, cautiously probing through the ruins and informational traps, and residue races.But all of that was a ways off, and for the moment Relay's Blight "windfall" was a shrinking affair.And Marketing was even more interested in the Straumli refugee ship.None of the strategy programs  much less Grondr  believed the ship's secret could hurt the Blight, but there was a good chance it might bring commercial advantage when the Perversion finally got tired of its Transcendent game.And the Tines pack minds had caught their interest.It was very appropriate that a maximum effort be made, that Ravna give up her Docks job and go to the field.So, for a wonder, her childhood fantasy of rescue and questing adventure would actually come true.And even more surprising, I'm only half terrified by the prospect!Target[56]: Im sorry I diddnt anser for a while.I dont feel good a lot.Mister Steel says I should talk to you.He says I need more friends to make me feel better.Amdi says so too and hes my best friend of all like packs of dogs but smart and fun.I wish I could send pictures.Mister Steel will try to get ansers for all your questions.He is doing everything he can to help, but the bad packs will be back.Amdi and I tried the stuff you said with the ship.I am sorry, it still doesnt work I hate this dumb keybord  Org[57]: Hi, Jefri.Amdi and Mr.Steel are right.I always like to talk, and it will make you feel better There are inventions that might help Mister Steel.We've thought of some improvements for his bows and flamethrowers.I'm also sending down some fortress design information.Please tell Mister Steel that we can't tell him how to fly the ship.It would be dangerous even for an expert pilot to try  Target[57]: Ya, even Daddy had a hard time landing it.ikocxljikersw89iou43e5 I think Mister Steel just doesnt understand, and hes getting sorta disparate Isnt there other stuff, though, like they had in oldendays.You know, bombs and airplanes that we could make?Org[58]: There are other inventions, but it would take time for Mister Steel to make them.Our star ship is leaving Relay soon, Jefri.We'll be there long before other inventions would help  Target[58]: Your coming?Your finally coming!!!When do you leave?When will you get here???Ordinarily Ravna composed her messages to Jefri on a keyboard  it gave her some feeling for the kid's situation.He seemed to be holding up, though there were still days when he didn't write (it was strange to think of "mental depression" having any connection with an eight year old).Other times he seemed to have a tantrum at the keyboard, and across twenty one thousand light years she saw evidence of small fists slamming into keys.Ravna grinned at the display.Today she finally had something more than nebulous promises for him: she had a positive departure time.Jefri was going to like message [59].She typed: "We're scheduled to leave in seven more days, Jefri.Travel time will be about thirty days. "Should she qualify that?Latest postings on the Zone boundary newsgroups said the Bottom was unusually active.The Tines World was so close to the Slow Zone If the "storm" worsened, travel time would suffer.There was about a one percent chance the voyage would take more than sixty days.She leaned back from the keyboard.Did she really want to say that?Damn.Better be frank; these dates could affect the locals who were helping Jefri.She explained the "ifs" and "buts", then went on to describe the ship and the wonderful things they would bring.The boy usually didn't write at great length (except when he was relaying information from Steel), but he really seemed to like long letters from her.The Out of Band II was undergoing final consistency checks.Its ultradrive was rebuilt and tested; the Skroderiders had taken it out a couple of thousand light years to check the antenna swarm.The swarm worked great, too.She and Jefri would be able to talk through most of the voyage.As of yesterday, the ship was stocked with consumables.(That sounded like something out of medieval adventure.But you had to take some supplies when you were headed so far down that reality graphics couldn't be trusted. )Sometime tomorrow, Grondr's people would be loading the ship's hold with gadgets that might be real handy for a rescue.Should she mention those?Some of them might sound a bit intimidating to Jefri's local friends.That evening, she and the Skroderiders had a beach party.That's what they called it, though it was much more like the human version than an authentic Rider one.Blueshell and Greenstalk had rolled well back from the water, to where the sand lay dry and warm.Ravna laid out refreshments on Blueshell's cargo scarf.They sat on the sand and admired the sunset.It was mostly a celebration  that Ravna had gotten permission to go with the OOB, that the ship was almost ready to depart.But, "Are you really happy to be going, my lady?"asked Blueshell."We two will make very good money, but you  "  Ravna laughed."I'll get a travel bonus. "She had argued and argued for permission to go; there wasn't much room left to haggle about the pay."And yes.This is what I really want. ""I am glad," said Greenstalk."I am laughing," said Blueshell."My mate is especially pleased that our passenger will not be surly.We almost lost our love for bipeds after shipping with the certificants.But there is nothing to be frightened of now.Have you read Threats Group in the last fifteen hours?The Blight has stopped growing, and its edges have become sharply defined.The Perversion is settling into middle age.I'm ready to leave right now. "Blueshell was full of speculations about the Tinish "packs", and possible schemes for extracting Jefri and any other survivors.Greenstalk interjected a thought here and there.She was less shy than before, but still seemed softer, more diffident than her mate.And her confidence was a bit more realistic.She was glad they weren't leaving for another week.There were still the final consistency checks to run on the OOB  and Grondr had gotten Org financing for a small fleet of decoy ships.Fifty were complete so far.A hundred would be ready by the end of the week.The Docks drifted into night.With its shallow atmosphere, twilight was short, but the colors were spectacular.The beach and the trees glistened in the horizontal rays.The scent of evening flowers mixed with the tang of sea salt.On the far side of the sea, all was stark bright and dark, silhouettes that might have been Vrinimi fancies or functional dock equipage  Ravna had never learned which.The sun slid behind the sea.Orange and red spread along the aft horizon, topped by a wider band of green, probably ionized oxygen.The Riders didn't turn their skrodes for a better view  for all she knew, they had been looking that way all along  but they stopped talking.As the sun set, the breakers shattered it into a thousand images, glints of green and yellow through the foam.She guessed the two would have preferred to be out there just now.She had seen them often enough around sunset, deliberately sitting where the surf was hardest.When the water drew back, their stalks and fronds were like supplicants' arms, upstretched.At times like these she could almost understand the Lesser Skroderiders; they spent their whole lives memorizing such repeated moments.She smiled in the greenish twilight.There would always be time enough later to worry and plan.They must have sat like that for twenty minutes.Along the curving line of the beach, she saw tiny fires in the gathering dark: office parties.Somewhere very nearby there was the crunch crunch of feet on sand.She turned and saw that it was Pham Nuwen."Over here," she called.Pham ambled toward them.He'd been very scarce since their last confrontation; Ravna guessed that some of her jibes had struck deep.This once, I hope Old One made him forget.Pham Nuwen had the potential to be a real person; it hadn't been right to hurt him because his principal was beyond reach."Have a seat.Galaxy rise in a half hour. "The Skroderiders rustled, so deep into the sunset that they were only now noticing the visitor.Pham Nuwen walked a pace or two beyond Ravna and stood arms akimbo, staring across the sea.He glanced back at her, and the green twilight gave his face an eerie fierceness.He flashed his old, lopsided smile."I think I owe you an apology. "Old One's gonna let you join the human race after all?But Ravna was touched.She dropped her eyes from his."I guess I owe you one too.If Old One won't help, he won't help; I shouldn't have lost my temper. "Pham Nuwen laughed softly, "Yours was certainly the lesser error.I'm still trying to figure out where I went wrong, and I don't think I have time now to learn. "He looked back at the sea.After a moment, Ravna stood and stepped toward him.Up close, his stare looked glassy."What's wrong?"Damn you, Old One.If you're going to abandon him, don't do it in pieces!"You're the great expert on Transcendent Powers, eh?"More sarcasm."Well  "  "Do the big boys have wars?"Ravna shrugged."You can find rumors of everything.We think there's conflict, but something too subtle to call war. ""You're pretty much right.There is struggle, but it has more angles than anything down here.The benefits of cooperation are normally so great that That's part of the reason I didn't take the Perversion seriously.Besides, the creature is pitiful: a wimpy cur that fouls its own den.Even if it wanted to kill other Powers, something like that never could.Not in a billion years"  Blueshell rolled up beside them."Who is this, my lady?"It was the sort of Riderish conversation stopper that she was only just getting used to.If Blueshell would just get in synch with his skrode memory, he'd know.Then the question truly hit her.Who is this?She glanced at her dataset.It was showing transceiver status, had been ever since Pham Nuwen arrived.And by the Powers, three transceivers had been grabbed by a single customer!She took a quick step backwards."You!""Me!Face to face once more, Ravna. "The leer was a parody of Pham's self assured smile."Sorry I can't be charming tonight. "He slapped his chest awkwardly."I'm using this thing's underlying instincts I'm too busy trying to stay alive. "There was drool coming down his chin.Pham's eyes would focus on her and then drift."What are you doing to Pham!"The Emissary Device stepped toward her, stumbled."Making room," came Pham Nuwen's voice.Ravna spoke Grondr's phone code.There was no response.The Emissary Device shook its head."Vrinimi Org is very busy right now, trying to convince me to get off their equipment, trying to screw up their courage and force me off.They don't believe what I'm telling them" He laughed, a quick choking sound."Doesn't matter.I see now that the attack here was just a deadly diversion How about that, Little Ravna?See, the Blight is not a Class Two perversion.In the time I have left, I can only guess what it is Something very old, very big.Whatever it is, I'm being eaten alive. "Blueshell and Greenstalk had rolled close to Ravna.Their fronds made faint skritching noises.Some thousands of light years away, well into the Transcend, a Power was fighting for its life.And all they saw of it was one man turned into a slobbering lunatic."So that's my apology, Little Ravna.Helping you probably wouldn't have saved me. "His voice strangled on itself, and he took a gasping breath."But helping you now will be a measure of  vengeance is a motive you would understand.I've called your ship down.If you move fast and don't use agrav, you may survive the next hour. "Blueshell's voice was timid and blustery at the same time."Survive?Only a conventional attack could work down here, and there is no sign of one. "A maniac surrounded by the soft, quiet night.Ravna's dataset showed nothing strange except for the diversion of bandwidth to Old One.Pham Nuwen made a coughing laugh."Oh, it's conventional enough, but very clever.A few grams of replicant disorder, wafted in over weeks.It's blossoming now, timed with the attack you see The growth will die in a matter of hours, after it kills all of Relay's precious High automation Ravna!Take the ship, or die in the next thousand seconds.Take the ship.If you survive, go to the Bottom.Get the" the Emissary Device pulled itself straighter, and smiled its greenish smile a last time."And here is my gift to you, the best help I have left to give. "The smile disappeared.The glassy look was replaced by a wonder and then mounting terror.Pham Nuwen dragged in a great breath, and had time for one barking scream before he collapsed.He landed face down, twitching and choking in the sand.Ravna shouted Grondr's code again, and ran to Pham Nuwen.She pulled him over on his back and tried to clear his mouth.The fit lasted several seconds, Pham's limbs flailing randomly about.Ravna collected several solid hits as she tried to steady him.Then Pham went limp, and she could barely feel his breath.Blueshell was saying, "Somehow he's grabbed the OOB.It's four thousand kilometers out, coming straight for the Docks.Wail.We're ruined. "Unauthorized flight close to the Docks was cause for confiscation.Somehow Ravna didn't think it mattered anymore."Is there any sign of attack?"she said over her shoulder.She eased Pham's head back, made sure he had a clear breathing passage.Random rustling between the Skroderiders.Greenstalk: "Something is strange.We have service suspension on the main transceivers. "So Old One is still transmitting?"The local net is very clogged.Much automation, many employees being called to special duty. "Ravna rocked back.The sky was night dark, punctuated by a dozen bright points of light  ships guiding for the Docks.All very normal.But her own dataset was showing what Greenstalk reported."Ravna, I can't talk right now. "Grondr's clickety voice sounded out of the air beside her.This would be his associate program."Old One has taken most of Relay.Watch out for the Emissary Device. "A little late, that!"We've lost contact with the surveillance fence beyond the transceivers.We are having program and hardware failures.Old One claims we are being attacked. "A five second pause."We see evidence of fleet action at the domestic defense boundary. "That was just a half light year out."Brap!"From Blueshell."At the domestic defense boundary!How could you miss them coming in?"He rolled back and forth, pivoted.Grondr's associate ignored the question."Minimum three thousand ships.Destruction of transceivers immin  "  "Ravna, are the Skroderiders with you?"It was still Grondr's voice, but more staccato, more involved.This was the real guy."Y yes. ""The local network is failing.Life support failing.The Docks will fall.
