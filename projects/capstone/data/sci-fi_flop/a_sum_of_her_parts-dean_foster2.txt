Now then, he began firmly, I want to know all about current local politics.By local I mean the SAEC, points north, and relevant international relations.This is my home and its useful to occasionally know how its being treated.Whispr looked helplessly at Ingrid.With a sigh, she began relating what she could recall from the last news she could remember reading.Fortunately the soft voiced give and take between her and their host did not last long, and the three of them were soon fast asleep in a landscape of such complete silence that it was almost painful.CLIMATE WISE, MORNING SAW AN exact repetition of the day before, and the day before that.There are seasonal changes here.Barnato was finishing the breakfast he had prepared.Mostly when the fogs make it this far inland.Then, desert or not, you can have some really cold mornings.But it sure is good for water extraction.Ingrid nodded and rose.Thank you for your hospitality, for the food, for the conversation: for everything.But we really need to be on our way.Thats all right.Putting his eating utensils aside he turned and scuttled to the far end of the excavation that was his home.When he returned it was with one fist clenched.Youve both been very kind to a solitary old fool.So Id like to give you something.Though he was speaking only to Ingrid, Whispr was not offended.Had their situations been reversed he would have done exactly the same.Youre the prettiest woman Ive seen in some time.Hell, he said, chuckling, youre the only woman Ive seen in some time.I told you I like pretty rocks.Maybe you do too.Opening his palm he passed her a rough, shiny stone about the size of her eye and the color of cranberry lipstick.Id like you to have it.Because I like giving stones away and because Id like you to remember me.His gaze rose slightly.Its a little too dark to match your hair.Taking it from him she held it up to the light and made a show of studying the badly scratched present.The least she could do was humor him.She could toss it away later, somewhere safely distant along their route.Its very pretty.Thank you, Pul.She made a small ceremony out of putting it in her backpack.Later, looking rearward as they resumed their march to the north, she could see the old prospector standing atop the edge of his simple underground dwelling.He was waving to them with all four of his arms: two sporting hands and two maniped digging melds.She returned his wave.What a way to waste a life.Whispr was not looking back and not waving.Living in a hole in the ground, surviving on scraps and bugs, slaving away at manual labor for nothing.He nodded curtly toward her pack.I was hoping he might give you something worthwhile, but clearly in all his years of wasting away out here he hasnt found anything.Yes he has, Whispr, she countered.Hes found happiness.Most people dig for that their whole lives and never strike pay dirt.Her companion shook his head sadly.You and I have always had different definitions of both happiness and pay dirt, doc.Me, I wouldve liked to have gotten something salable.Not a worthless pebble.You gonna keep it?I shouldnt have to tell you by now that the farther you walk the heavier every gram gets.She returned her gaze forward.I dont know if Ill keep it or not.Maybe its not worth anything, but I like the color.As far as weight goes, the more of our food we eat, the lighter our packs get.She indicated the programmed line they were following.Whats more interesting to me is that the location of the spring Barnato mentioned matches the coordinates for one of the water holes on our maps.Thats the first solid indication that Morgan Ouspel didnt sell us a bill of goods.Or set us on a wandering path to a slow death.So long as theres water and I have my NEM supplements He picked up the pace.Several weeks ago the now travel hardened Ingrid would have been unable to match his gangling stride.Pul Barnato watched them until they disappeared.Given the supernal clarity of the air in the Namib that took quite a while.Then he turned and dropped back down into his home.The excavation was also the entrance to his diggings, though as much as he had enjoyed the previous nights company he had seen no reason to inform his guests of that fact.Pulling aside an unprepossessing piece of camo cloth he bent low and started walking.A modest distance later he entered an old volcanic tube.One side of it had been broken down by heavy manual labor.Removing his ragged vest he stretched, took a deep breath, and brought his melded arms forward.Armored osseomelds alternately slammed into and shoveled aside rock and rubble.Once he had accumulated a decent pile of the latter he sat down and picked up a sifting pan.Like all the rest of his equipment it used no power, required no batteries, and gave off no emissions for a patrolling searcher to lock on to.An hour or so of careful sifting produced three glassy pebbles and a number of much smaller stones.These he dumped into an ancient five gallon jerry can that he had salvaged from a rusting wreck farther to the south and west.The can was about half full of similar pretty rocks.Among them were one or two that were identical in color to the much larger stone he had bequeathed to his courteous red haired guest.Idly, he wondered if either she or her acerbic companion had ever seen a natural red diamond before.The Sum of Her Parts     3 The last thing they expected to have to deal with was rain.They had set off from Orangemund equipped with food, water and water extractors, communicators, lightweight sleeping gear, appropriate footwear and outer attire, and everything else they could think of that would enable two travelers on foot to survive in the unfamiliar Namib.They had not considered the possibility of rain.Not with the region they were traversing typically receiving a couple of centimeters of precipitation in a good year.It seemed as if all of it was falling on them now.Designed to keep off the sun, their wide brimmed hats soaked up the pelting moisture instead of repelling it.While there was nothing in their packs that could be seriously harmed by getting rained on, including their sealed concentrates and waterproof communicators, Ingrid had no desire to see everything soaked.This is ridiculous!she declared as she trudged up the dry riverbed alongside Whispr.Contrary to the hoary jokes he had been forced to deal with ever since he had gone through his extensive slimming meld, he was not so thin that he was able to step between the falling drops.Five minutes into the unexpected downpour he was thoroughly drenched and more depressed than usual.If the day had begun hot, the shower would have been welcome.Instead, it simply rendered both of them miserable and clammy.While she couldnt vouch for her companions personal supplies, Ingrid had the foresight to bring along spare underwear.Her single outer set of safari attire would just have to dry out in its own good time.Ridiculous and uncomfortable, he agreed.Unlike the gully where days earlier they had taken refuge from the patrolling searcher, the current winding channel was smooth sided and offered no shelflike overhangs capable of sheltering them from the momentary deluge.They had no choice but to tolerate the rain until it ceased.From everything he had read about the Namib prior to leaving Orangemund, that was likely to be soon.Sure enough, the entire storm lasted less than fifteen minutes from the time it unloaded its first drops until the sky cleared and the sun reappeared.Making a face, he swung his pack around in front of him and jiggled it firmly, shaking off as much of the clinging liquid as possible.Ingrid did her best to put a good face on their situation.Look at us, wasting water in the Namib.I can think of at least half a dozen public and private environmental organizations back home that would condemn us out of hand.Her efforts failed to amuse her companion.I dont care if we are in a desertI dont like being wet.Ever since I locked up with you on this madmans outing it seems like Ive spent half the time being wet.In Savannah, in Miavana, in Sanbona, and now even in the middle of the worlds oldest farking desert!He glared across at her as he slipped the self cushioning pack around onto his back.Despite the chance to make some serious subsist out of all this there are times since I wish Id just given you the damn thread and walked out of your neat and tidy little office.He turned wistful.I could be back in Savannah sharing stim with my friends instead of out here hiking from nowhere to Nowhere.So much for trying to lighten the atmosphere, she thought.Her tone hardened.I got the impression you didnt have many friends.He looked at her sharply.Hey, I knew plenty of people!Lots of people.Theres a world of difference between acquaintances and friends.That so?I thought you were a doctor of medicine, not philosophy.His voice turned challenging.How many friends you got, doc?Not professional colleagues.Not grateful patients.Real friends.She bridled.Ive got plenty!Theres Suzanne, and Leora.Whisprs angular face screwed up in a rictus of dismay as he interrupted.What the hell kind of name is Leora?Its a perfectly good name!she snapped back at him.Shes a probe specialist who works in my tower, a fine technician and a true friend andwhy are you nodding and smiling like that?Are you patronizing me?He looked away.How could I do that, Ingrid?Im just a lowly subsist scrabbling street Meld and youre a respectable uptown doctor.Why, just look at how respectable you are!Entering another country under a false name, maniping your body and face to conceal your identity, flaunting your beauty to distract attention and questions from what youre doing here.That has nothing to do with the number and quality of friends that I !She paused and her tone changed abruptly.Flaunting my what?Your beauty.He continued without hesitating but with his gaze fixed firmly on the next bend in the ravine that was leading them northward.It dazzles men, and probably some women.Naturals and Melds alike.I know: I can bear witness to its effects.And that was before the hair and boob manip.Maybe youre unaware of it, but you stun people quietly.She gaped at him.Then she shook her head and irritably kicked aside a small rock in her path.You have the most peculiar way of pissing people off, Whispr.Now he did turn to look at her, his reply floating on his characteristic sardonicism.Riffling isnt my only talent.She drew herself up.Youre just trying to flatter me, to win the argument.He scowled.Whenever a woman says to a man youre just trying to flatter me, what shes really saying is flatter me some more.They strode onward in silence for several minutes.Off to his left a lizard vanished into a crack in the ravine wall, its black and gray striped tail a swift shrinking, highly agitated punctuation mark.When she finally spoke again it was to say something that shook him to the core, affecting him even more powerfully than had Napun Mols attempt on their lives in Florida or the recent pursuit of their vehicle in the Sanbona Preserve.As long as were arguing about friendshave you ever been in love, Whispr?He dared not look at her.What could he say that would not give him away?That at first hed been able to muster only adoration for one so exquisite and so far above his social station?That when they had decided to work together to try to unravel the mystery of the thread and she had become suddenly approachable his adoration had advanced (or more appropriately devolved) into lust?That what had developed subsequently was a jumble of feelings to which try as he might he could not put a suitable label?Was that love?Was it shallow because he was shallow, or might he dare to believe that despite his generally miserable life that he was capable of something deeper and more meaningful?He was confused.Confused, uncertain, fearful, ashamed, and most of all in pain.The pain blasted through him every time he looked at her.When she walked, when she ate, when she slept and he could gaze upon her openly and without having to worry that she would notice and take offense at his stare.Youre a riffler, he told himself.A riffler, a murderer (however unintentionally), a haunter of the fringes of respectable society, a disposable blowaway Meld.Youre only hurting yourself if you think anything more than a short term business relationship could ever eventuate between you and this woman.Except for the pain, of course.Unlike her, that would always stay with him.On such pain he skated across an emotional landscape as frozen as any arctic lake.Each casual word hurt anew, each criticism only brought more agony.He wanted it to go away, to leave him, to evaporate like the water from the recent atypical downpour.But it would not.It stayed strong and throbbing and was eating him up from the inside out.Yeah, he concluded.It felt like love, all right.Whispr?She was pointing in front of them.A snake was crossing from one side of the arroyo to the other.It was brown and much smaller than the ferocious mamba that had indifferently slithered across Ingrid in the cave where they had hidden from the searcher drone.He didnt know if this one was poisonous or not.He found that he didnt care.Easy to go around it, he told her.As forwhat were we talking about?Oh, yeah, love.Sure Ive been in love, he told her.There was one particular woman He did not complete the thought.He could not.Her interest was genuineand its innocence only added to the pain.I take it that it didnt work out?No.He struggled to articulate.It didnt work out.What was she like?Natural or Meld?She started as a Natural.But everyone starts out as a Natural, he added hastily.Beautiful.Smartmuch smarter than me.A professional, not a street Meld.We fought a lot, but we managed to get along.As a matter of fact, I think we were both surprised at how well we managed to get along even though we didnt really have a lot in common.Even though she was pretty she was a tough little bugger.Resilient.I liked that about her.Ingrid was smiling now.This was much better than arguing.And what did she like about you?she teased him.He spat to one side.Damned if I know.A pause.Maybe she liked me because I let her be herself, and do what she wanted to do, and I didnt demand too much of her.She nodded enthusiastically.Yes, a woman likes that.Of course, so does a guy.Anyone would, I suppose.You would too, of course, he said flatly.Of course.IfwhenI find myself in a permanent relationship itll have to be with someone who espouses all those things.A familiar, frustrating wall thrust up between them, the portcullis slammed down, and his expression twisted.What does espouse mean?Is it like expose?Not really.It means She stopped, frowning.Do you hear something?Besides the warm liquid honey that is your voice, you mean?He forced himself to concentrate on the surrounding realityand then he also frowned.Yeah, I hear it.He was suddenly alarmed.Sounds like a truck, or at least a 44.Not a floater, and too loud to be a drone.The noise grew louder, a steadily rising roar.Awfully big truck, if thats what it is, she commented uneasily.Especially for a place where theres no road.Could be a freight transporter.Big one.He began searching the flanking, winding walls of the ravine for another hiding place.Anything like that out here, it would have to belong to the company.Another long moment passed while they stood standing motionless and listening.The growl continued to grow in volume.Thats no truck, he muttered.Too consistent, too loud, too He never finished the thought, as it was interrupted by the raging wall of brown and white water that came thundering around the nearest bend in the canyon.Flash flood.The atypical downpour that had temporarily soaked them had been far more intense off to the east.There, on the westernmost slopes of the Jakkalsberge, the deluge had filled rivulets and streams, arroyos and canyons, gathering volume and strength as it made a doomed rush toward a shore it would never reach.Instead the water spread out over the vast gravel plains, soaked into thirsty spongelike sands, and briefly filled to overflowing every dry gulch and desiccated gorge that striped the mountain slopes.Including the one up which they were presently hiking.RUN!She followed his lead as he turned and bolted back the way they had come.As they ran they frantically scanned the passing stone walls for signs of a way out, a way up, or even simple handholds.There was nothing; only the slick curving rock walls like waves frozen in time, whose sides had been scoured smooth by thousands of years of churning, rushing, polishing water.Predecessors of the thundering flood that was closing rapidly on them right now.Here, doc, over here!The several fissures in the rock wall that Whispr had found were too narrow to admit human fingers.Natural human fingers.The desperate street Meld jammed the bony pitons that were his attenuated digits into the barely visible cracks and started to pull himself upward.With his slender body flattened against the cool stone he looked like some skeletal desert arachnid.Hurrying to follow him, Ingrid stumbled in the sand and gravel, regained her footing, and tried to start up in his wake.Even with heavily trimmed nails her fingers were unable to gain a purchase on the rock.She screamed, but the apocalyptic bellow of the oncoming water drowned her out.Keeping the fingers of one hand firmly jammed in the deepest fracture he could find, Whispr reached down and grabbed her fluttering right hand.Climb!Use your feet, doc!Move!The water slammed into her, bursting upward over her shoulders as she turned her head away from the brutalizing current.The thin cablelike muscles in his arms strained as he strove to maintain his grip.Water surged all around them, tugging at her and stretching her out like a beige colored flag with her legs like tatters pointed downstream.She was too heavy, he was too weak, the flood was too strong.Her fingers slipped from his.Whispr!All the high tech trekking equipment in his pack could do nothing to strengthen his grip.He could only watch as the powerful current swept her away from him and carried her downstream.He saw her go under, come up with her head tilted back, and, spitting water, go under again.She reemerged at the first bend, trying desperately to get a purchase on the indifferent stone.Her hands flailed at the smooth rock.If she could hold on until the initial rush started to subside it would be okay, he told himself.His heart was pounding.For a moment he thought she had succeeded.Then she lost her newfound grip, wailed again, and slipped from view.The last thing he heard was his name, rising just above the roiling waters.Well, crap, he thought as he pulled his fingers out of the anchoring fissure and resignedly let go.He was a decent swimmer.Not trained, but living in a city threaded by canals and bulwarked by swamps it was a skill every child picked up at an early age.Trying to stay in the middle of the rush where the current was swiftest he made up the distance between them at an impressive pace.He would have gone much faster without his pack, but abandoning it would only see him trade drowning for a slower death.Without his special supplements he would leisurely starve.In the water his whiplike melded body offered almost no drag.He could see her now, not far in front of him.She was no longer making any effort to swim, either toward him, the canyon walls, or anywhere else.It was all she could do to keep her head above water.Though her eyes were half shut she continued to strike at the water with wild splashing, slapping waves of her arms, as if she could somehow subdue it physically.Her flailings were growing increasingly feeble.He noted that her own pack was still on her back.It would take more than the force of a flash flood to break the magfab straps.But it was weighing her down and making it difficult for her to stay afloat.Whispr had never seen such an awkward swimmer.Probably shed initially panicked when she had been swept away from him and had never regained control of herself.Go figure.Street bum keeps his cool and doctor panics.Hed have something to say about that.Then she went under again, did not resurface, and he feared he might not have someone to listen to the chidings he intended to deliver.Only the fact that some air had become trapped in her pack saved her.As he was giving up hope this added buoyancy bounced her back to the surface, facedown in the water.Having outdistanced its burden of plant matter, drowned small creatures, sand, soil, and sodden humans, the front of the flood and its throaty roar began to recede southward.Ramrod current had given way to irritated swirls by the time he got a hand on the upper straps of her pack, rolled her over, and started swimming to his right.Though equally flush with flood, the water in the tributary ravine he had spotted offered no resistance to his methodical strokes as he towed her out of the main flow.Narrowing while its floor rose rapidly, the bottom of the side canyon soon provided slippery but welcome purchase for his feet.Without knowing quite how he did it, his boots slipping on loose gravel and slick rocks and his slenderized muscles on fire, he hauled her body, backpack, and all up out of the side stream and onto dry land.There he laid her out on her back and collapsed beside her, his chest heaving.The empty blue overhead offered not even a solitary cloud by way of consolation.Didnt thinkdidnt think wed make it, doc.He wiped at his mouth, coughed, and spat onto the moisture welcoming surface.The droplets vanished instantly as they struck, sucked down into the ever thirsty ground.I couldnt hold youIm sorry.Whywhy didnt you try to swim back to me?I didnt think I was going to be able to catch up to She wasnt responding.Her eyes remained shut.Around her head her maniped red hair spread out in a saturated flaming corona.She was not moving.A coldness born of something much deeper and more malign than his recent swim crept over him.Doc?Ingrid?Oh hell, oh damn, oh shit.She was dead.She was dead and he was alone.Alone in the desert.Alone in the Namib.Alone inside.Ormaybe not.Could the patient save the doctor?Try, try, he had to trybut what to do?Bad water, good air.A prescription that was as straightforward as it was simple.Slipping frantically out of his pack, he rose to his knees and dumped it quickly to one side as he bent over her.Pressing both hands against her stomach, he pushed, not knowing if he was pressing too hard, not knowing if he was doing it right.He repeated the thrust once, twice.On the third time her body reacted: arching sharply upward, she retched from the bottom of her toes, spewing foul water and other stomach contents all over him.Turning his face away he ignored the warm dousing and prepared to push some more.He couldnt.Her stomach was out of his reach.Having rolled onto her left side she was jerking and spasming violently while clutching her midsection with both hands.More water gushed from her mouth to disappear in seconds into the desiccated earth.When the last foul drops had dribbled from her lips, her hands relaxed and all the air seemed to sigh out of her body.Her eyes remained closed.She was motionless once more.Ingrid?Hey, doc, you okay?Reaching over, he put a hand on her side and shoved.Gently at first, then when no reaction was forthcoming, more forcefully.Her right arm bobbed loosely.He didnt want to roll her over onto her back again in case there was still any water in her stomach or lungs, but he felt he had no choice.As he bent over her he startled himself by realizing that despite the desperate circumstances he was still able to recognize the irony of the situation.Here he was, targeting the lips and mouth with whose contact he had longed for since that day in her office, and he felt no stirring beyond a distinct touch of nausea that threatened to make him empty his own guts.Mouth to mouth.He wasnt trained in that ancient revival technique either, but he would do his best to improvise.Inclining his head forward and down he bent nearer, his open palms bracing themselves against the warm ground on either side of her shoulders.He was very close to her when she coughed in his face and her eyelids fluttered.He drew back hurriedly.Her eyelids snapped open and she took a moment to focus.I think Im not dead.A tight smile creased his narrow visage.Ill take that as an official medical pronouncement.She started to reply and instead found herself trying to throw up again.The resulting muscular confusion generated one of the more remarkable facial expressions hed ever seen on a Natural.Once her body relaxed, she swallowed and tried again.I feel like I did though.Die, that is.What happened?Raising her head slightly she looked around.Wheres the water?Where it belongs, in the canyon.The levels going down almost as fast as it came up.Speaking of coming up, I doubt theres much of anything left in your stomach, so you should be all right now.He smiled.Just my street medical opinion.Looking down at herself she pressed the fingertips of both hands lightly against her torso in the vicinity of her navel.Her expression turned queasy but she did not heave.Doesnt feel all right.I really thought I was dead.Sudden realization made her look at him sharply as she sat all the way up.How did I get out?I came after you.Swam, pulled you out.Saved your life.Sorry, but I dont believe in false modesty.If I hadnt risked mine you wouldnt now have yours.She pondered this for a long moment.Why did you do it, Whispr?He looked away from her and toward the ravine.Moments ago it had been filled to the brim with a roaring torrent.Now it gurgled merrily, like a retired professional athlete toying with outmatched neighborhood opponents.I dunno.Congenital stupidity, maybe.When she started to say something he jumped in ahead of her.Speaking of congenital stupidity why the hell didnt you swim toward me when you saw me coming after you?I know you saw meour eyes met.It wouldve made things a lot easier.You wouldnt have sunk so close to the edge.His anger helped to shove thoughts of the near mouth to mouth experience out of his mind.She looked away.WhisprI cant swim.That was not one of the responses he had been expecting.What the fark do you mean you cant swim?Everyone in the Greater Savannah region can swim.They have to learn.Too much of the place is underwater.What idiots never taught you to swim?Her voice strengthened a little.My idiot parents, who raised me in Topeka, overlooked passing along that particular skill.Not a critical need for it in Topeka.I suppose not, he acknowledged.Uh, wheres Topeka?She told him.Dry country.High country.Safe country.I learned a lot, but not how to swim.I was always too busy with academics.Didnt even get to the local soche very often to mix with the other kids.Noting his expression she added, I know it doesnt make any sense.There are several exercise pools in my tower, salt water as well as fresh, and Ive never done more than wade in any of them.I love the beach, I even love the water.I just cant swim.She swallowed hard and her voice dropped.If you hadnt come after me, Whispr, Id have drowned.Before he realized it, he spoke more harshly than he intended.Tell me something I dont know.He was stunned and confused by what happened next.Dr.Ingrid Seastrom started to cry.Despite everything they had been through, despite all they had endured since leaving Savannah, she had always maintained her composure throughout.She had not cried when Napun Mol had held them at gunpoint in the Everglades, nor when their fleeing 44 had crashed into the river in Sanbona.She had not cried when Josini Jay Joh Umfolozi had stuck a gun in her face in the cab of his nephews commercial transporter and threatened to blow her brains out.Whispr knew how to deal with an attack on the street.He knew how to disarm aggravated police with flattering words and outmaneuver muscle bound lods with practiced side steps.He knew the best way to wrangle donations from kindhearted tourists and riffle unaware business folk.But he did not have the slightest notion what to do now.So he fell back on his tried and true method for minimizing mistakes: he did nothing.I cantI dont know, Whispr, she coughed between sobs.Im notI wasnt made for this.I should be in my office back home treating the sick and injured, not being the sick and injured.Physician, heal thyself.She started to laugh but was too weak to do more than gasp a few desultory chuckles.This is all a bad dream.You, assassins, SICK, the thread; all of it.Were going to die here and its my fault.My stubborn, stupid, single minded fault!A bad dream.Bad karma.Hed had enough.Bad drama, you mean.Reaching down, he slipped his arms under hers and lifted her to her feet.In her expression, confusion and despair made room for shock.Get a hold of yourself, doc!First of all, the were all gonna die mantra is mine.I claim it by right of origination.So you can forget about blubbering that one again.You want to bawl?Fine, go ahead and tearwork your lady ducts until theyre as dry as the ground where were standing.But we are here and we are going to go on and we are going to get into the facility at Nerens and learn what that thread is all about.Then maybe well end up dead, but not before.Because Im damned if Ive wasted all this time and trouble and energy and effort just to indulge some spoiled bitchwitch of a doctor who thinks shes on some tiptoliday and can just up and quit and call a cab to go home because shes decided to go all boredass on me!She stood gaping at him wide eyed until he finally ran down.At first he thought she was going to break out crying again.Then what he hoped would happen began to take place before his eyes.She started to get mad.Serious mad.When she swung at him he dodged.When she aimed a furious frustrated kick at his crotch he slipped easily to one side.The fact that he was smiling at her all the while only squared her fury.You bastard!You miserable bumscum, you filthy !Thats it, doc.As he avoided her futile, untutored blows and kicks he did his best to egg her on.Get it all out.All the aggravation, all the anger; leave it here on the sand and rock.Mix it with your vomit.Whoa!Her next blow nearly connected with his face.I cant argue about one thing, though, he concluded as he continued to dance around her.You got me all wet again.Still livid but too exhausted by her near death swim to keep swinging, she paused and blinked at him.Then she started to laugh again, only this time it was more than a couple of transitory chuckles.She laughed until she cried, and then she was crying again, and then laughing.Holding at a safe distance and watching her he was reminded of why, as a friend had once told him while sharing a particularly potent stim in Eastwood Park in the north of the city, women were not just another gender but another species.He let her face flood until he feared she might sprain something.Okay, doc.Thats enough.I think you got everything out now.Food, flood water, emotions.You look drained, anyway.Approaching warily, he gripped her right shoulder and squeezed reassuringly.Her eyes tilted up to meet his own and for a moment, for an instant, there was something in her expression that He imagined she was going to embrace him.He welcomed it and he feared it.As it turned out, the emotional energy he devoted to both possibilities was wasted because she held off, held back, and instead of moving toward him, knelt to fumble with her pack.Within his shriveled soul a small spark winked out as swiftly as it had unexpectedly sprung to life.Wordlessly, he bent to help her.Her communicator was gone, swept away by the force of the flood that had ripped open the pockets of her pants.That left them with only his own device and, in a dire emergency, a simple mechanical compass.Using only those instruments they would have to make it the rest of the way to Nerens.The antique compass with its magnetic needle and flat unilluminated face had been an afterthought, pressed on them by the shopkeeper in Orangemund who had outfitted them with their trekking supplies.It was one piece of gear that did not need batteries.Leaving her to finish going through her battered pack he left to make an inventory of his own supplies.Thanks to the unbreakable pack straps both of them still had their sleeping blankets, waterpaks, and most of their food concentrates.For one terrible moment he thought that the tubes containing his vital nutrient supplements had been swept away.He finally found the package, still dry and intact, where it had become wrapped up in a shirt.All they had surrendered to the rampaging flash flood was some food, some time, and some unreasonable assumptions.You can do this, doc.He stood nearby as she finished repacking her gear.We can do this.Sure well end up dead eventually, but we can do this.She had tied the bottom of her shirt up in a knot beneath her breasts, exposing her belly.Not that the sight of the few creamy centimeters of exposed flesh were all that he could have wished for, but he would take what he could get.They constituted a wondrous diversion from the desiccated terrain around them.Once again, Whispr, she observed dryly, I find myself having to rely on your unreserved enthusiasm to motivate me.She took a deep breath, which did wonders for his own motivation.I promise you this: if we make it to Nerens and I can get us inside, you wont be killed.How can you make a promise like that?He hastened to parallel her as she struck off northward, following the edge of the ravine that had tried to kill them.In the full knowledge that if Im wrong I wont have to listen to you harangue me about it.He snorted.Ah, seenow youre the one whos smiling.Periodically pausing to check their progress against the maps contained in his communicator, they followed the ravine northward until it turned east toward the mountains that had spawned the flash flood.There followed another broad stretch of hard ground that save for scattered gravel was as smooth and flat and lifeless as the paved floor of a building supply warehouse.As they advanced, Whispr kept glancing nervously at the sky.Out on such open terrain they would be as visible to a searcher drone or passing hi rez satellite as the Eiffel Tower in a cornfield.But nothing materialized to question their progress.Even the ubiquitous black and white crows had temporarily foresworn the travelers company, there being nothing for them to scavenge in such a dead, barren place.Occasionally they would stop at pools of fresh rainwater to slake their thirst, grateful for these smaller and less violent echoes of the recent atypical downpour and the chance to hydrate without having to dig into their supplies.Both were relieved when the flat pan gave way to low hills cut by smaller gullies than the one from which they had recently escaped.True to form, Ouspels course followed one of these northward.Whispr especially was thankful for the opportunity to once again advance under cover.It took some urging on his part to persuade Ingrid to descend once more into a winding fissure in the rocks.The memory of having nearly drowned in another was still far too fresh for comfort.We have to stay in the ravines, he reminded her firmly.Theyre the only cover we have from Sperrgebeit patrols.Also, in the sun it makes for cooler walking.I know, I know.Its onlyI know it isnt reasonable, Whispr.But most psychological blocks arent.Its not that Ive turned suddenly hydrophobic.Its just that the close call I had, that we had, is so recent.She nodded toward the gullys shadowy depths.Why cant we follow it by walking along the edge?I just told you why.Because a searcher drone would be able to spot us from a distance.Thats why Ouspels instructions insist we go down into them.This is the kind of terrain that let him get away clean from the facility.He marshaled more of his argument.It would be hell to have made it all this way only to get picked up by SICK security because you cant handle walking in a gulch thats four meters deep.She stood contemplating the silent fissure in the earth for another few minutes.He said nothing more, waiting patiently.Finally she nodded and started down the slope before them, sliding and slipping her way to the sandy bottom.That it was covered with a centimeter or so of pooled rainfall did nothing to improve her mood.Feeling as though she were standing with her feet sunk halfway into a mirror and that if she took one wrong step she would sink out of sight into it forever, she looked over at him.If were caught in another flash flood youll save me again, wont you?He smiled.Sure.Why not?If I drown out here chances are itll be quicker than whats waiting for us in Nerens.She made a face and allowed her pack to reposition itself against her shoulders and spine.The integrated pressure pads expanded downward to compensate for the shift.Ill try my best not to inhibit your demise, since the speed with which it will occur seems to be of paramount importance to you.You bet your ass it is, doc.As he walked beside her his narrow feet kicked up rainwater.The drops hung briefly in the desert air like glass marbles.Maybe if I die first you can time it.The Sum of Her Parts     4 The House of Nasty.An admirably straightforward description, Mol mused.Also an in your face acknowledgment of what lay within.As he stood contemplating the floating glowing sign that hovered above and just in front of the dubious establishment, the pedestrians shuffling and hurrying around him ignored the unremarkable old man in their midst.It was no different here than in Tokyo, or Newnew York, or London or Hio Janeiro or Sagramanda.He was a nonentity.Even more, he was an elderly nonentity.Clearly no threat to anyone, too plainly dressed to be worth riffling, a cipherous bit of perambulating protoplasm that posed no evident threat to man, Meld, beast, or any combination thereof.That was just how he liked it.Should anyone happened to have glanced in the direction of the innocuous figure who was staring at the sign over the basement entrance they would never have guessed that beneath the elderly exterior surged an occasional and sometimes lethal volcanic eruption of aggravation.It was just as well that no one did.Mol was in no mood to suffer the inquisitive.Curiosity was intrusive, intrusion was invasion, and invaders were as likely to have their throats cut as their cheeks patted, depending on his frame of mind.At the moment the latter was as dark as the hour of night.The heavy cloud cover that had settled in over Cape Town like a thick wool blanket matched his mood.He had lost the trail.Lost track of his quarry.The mildly deranged doctor and her nonentity stick man Meld of a companion had vanished from the hunters ken, plucked literally from under his gaze by the operator of a counterfeit elephant.While Mol had looked on helplessly from atop a hill in the backcountry of the Sanbona Preserve, the quadrupedal mechanical transport had picked up his targets, turned, and strode off to the north.That did not mean its final destination lay to the north.Once out of his sight it could have gone in any direction, further complicating his interrupted pursuit of the two Namericans.The machine itself was the only clue he had left.He still had no idea where the two mismatched thieves were going or what they intended to do with the thread.The fact that they had come here, to the heartland of his present employers, had been a sufficiently startling development in itself.Subsequent to their arrival everything they had done had been characteristic of the classic African tourist.They had done nothing to suggest that they were travelers in possession of extremely valuable stolen property.Did they know that it was him who had nearly run them down in Sanbona?Not that it mattered.Having been alerted to the fact that their presence in southern Africa had been discovered they would be even more on their guard than ever.Which would make his job of locating them all over again harder than ever.Despite his frustration he did not despair.Failure was not in his vocabulary.It was one reason why he was repeatedly hired for such difficult tasks.He had never failed to complete whatever assignment he had accepted.Nor would this be the first time.He certainly would not be bested by a pair of bumbling amateur know nothings from Namerica who did not even understand the significance of what they had taken.If the trail ahead disappears a good tracker knows to retrace his steps and search for overlooked clues on ground already trodden.Careful probing and questioning had led him here, tonight, to the least reputable section of Cape Town; a district so despised that the honorable citizens of the city could not wait for the planets slowly rising waters to overtake and consume it.The House of Nasty, in fact, lay below sea level.The original brick walls of the basement in the old harbor warehouse had been reinforced and rendered watertight by being infused with a penetrating liquid epoxy.The result was the modern but far sturdier chemical equivalent of the Delft tiles the Dutch had once used to waterproof the lower floors of their own buildings.While not as attractive as the hand painted seventeenth century Dutch materials, the newer composites were considerably more hydrophilic.Within the shimmering sign above the entrance a continuously scanning optical pickup concluded that the eyes of the small man standing in the street had been focused on the front of the building for the requisite predetermined length of time.Responding to its programming, the sign dispatched a targeted mobiad.Descending onto the street, this slowed to a halt at the psychologically predetermined optimum distance from the potential customers eyes.The glowing motile advertisement then proceeded to flash fire a series of three dimensional vit images calculated to stimulate the more degenerate crevices and recesses of the singled out viewers brain.For a modest fee, any and all of these advertised depravities could be had by simply strolling to the entrance of the named establishment, suitably identifying oneself at the door as an adult, and requesting admittance.Mol irritably waved the mobiad aside, his hand brushing through the images.Casual obscenities were obliterated, outrageous smut interrupted.If the information he had accumulated over the previous several days was accurate, he would find the individual he sought partaking of the soiled delights within.The fiercely touted attractions did not inveigle him.He was quite capable of amusing himself without having to pay an unimaginative supplier.It was noisy inside the House of Nasty, but not oppressively so.The intense goolmech that directly tickled ones tympanum was comparatively subdued.So was the lighting.The latter condition was a given.Although perfectly willing to pay whatever was asked in order to indulge their preferential perversions, that did not mean the participants were prepared to have them highlighted for the delectation of potential tattletales.It was all well and good to delve into the depths of depravity and splash around in the muck, but not so if the details were allowed to find their way back to a spouse or relative or fiance.As he threaded his way through the prattling, giggling, sucking crowd, the ambient illumination in the clubs main chamber shifted from red to purple and back again as artfully as in a properly mixed drink.Though the music being hammered out was not to his taste, he was grateful for the strings and percussion that drowned out most of the dim witted palaver passing for conversation around him.Two bar counters separated by a dance floor and scattered tables faced each other across the basement.If they ran true to form they would offer more than alcohol.It was a truism of humanity that once a new stimulant or narcotic became available, a thousand people would line up to try it without a care as to whether it was effective, indifferent, or fatal.When it came to stimulants, reputation always trumped well being.A place like this, he reflected, would stock the latest of everything.Better living through chemistry.Or better dying.Someone stepped in front of him to block his path.In her late thirties, the Meld was still attractive, with a voluptuous body whose gym and pill toned attributes included three breasts that threatened to erupt from her single piece cerulean dress like toothpaste from a broken old fashioned tube.He eyed the various regions of bulging tanned flesh distastefully while drifting spheres of lime green light ambled across them.Having no time for such diversions he impatiently tried to step around her.She sidled sideways to intercept him once again.Already bent slightly forward at the waist to emphasize his fragility, he twisted his torso into an even more damaged posture.Please excuse me, madam.I am here only to quietly imbibe and perhaps have something to eat.Putting hands on hips she struck a pose that was at least five thousand years old and threw him a lecherous smirk.What, all supping and no tupping?Dont you find me attractive?Even at my age and with my poor vision I can still say yes to that, my dear.Surely you do not think the same of me?Before she could respond he raised a trembling hand to forestall the rote response that he knew would be forthcoming.Anything to get rid of her.Please, no falsified flattery.I am not ashamed of my natural condition.Find yourself someone who can muster at least a minimum of endurance to match your intentions and leave me to drown my musings in peace.The leer she wore like a carnivale mask widened.So drinkings your thing?Want to know what mine is?Before he could demur she leaned toward him, multiple cleavage on ample display.I like old guys, she whispered and then straightened.Want to know why?He did not, but neither did he want to cause a scene and possibly scare off the person he was really looking for.Why, my dear?Because I get off on their gratitude.It gives me a chill thrill.Thats a fair swap, isnt it?Reaching out she rested a hand on his left shoulder and squeezed, the nails that had been permanently bonded to the finger bones digging slightly into his flesh.I know Ill get mine.I guarantee youll get yours.The vast variety of decadent tastes exhibited by humankind never failed to sadden him.I know I could give you a surprise, madam, but I have neither the inclination nor the time nor the strength.He took a step forward.A pale yellow orb drifted past his face and for the barest instant was reflected in his eyes.Had the trolling slummer blocking his way seen it she might have fled.Instead she stood her ground.A surprise?You?That would be a first, but I like firsts.Maybe youre not up to much, but you strike me as someone whos been around.Im willing to take my chances.She gestured to her right.
