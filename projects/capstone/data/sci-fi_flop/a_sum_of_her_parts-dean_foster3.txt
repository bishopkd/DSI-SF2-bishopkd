We could rent a gas tube.Id split it with you.She grinned.Then you can split me, old man.Her leering persistence had become intolerable.Mustering a smile, he caught her gaze with his.Peering into his eyes she sensed rather than saw his right hand slide up the front of her body.Convinced she had made a sale she relaxed, expecting the hand to go higher.Instead it halted below her breasts in the vicinity of her solar plexus.Unexpectedly powerful melded fingers moved and thrust.Her eyes bulged.Her mouth opened in a wide O and she inhaled sharply, only to find that her lungs wouldnt work.Will this do for a surprise?he murmured softly.Eyes still wide she continued to stare at him.Then they fluttered shut and she crumpled to the floor like a pile of overcooked yams.Two nearby couples interrupted their simulated coitus to look over in surprise.Mol smiled at them.I think she took too strong a stimcomb.Shell be fine.He stepped over the motionless body that had contracted into a fetal position.Let the staff handle it.They are paid to do so.The two couples eyed the speaker, who was patently too old and feeble to have done anything untoward, and returned to their loveless playacting.Having dealt with the brief nuisance, Mol worked his way through the gyrating crowd to the nearer of the opposing bars.It was crewed by two mixologists, one Natural and one Meld.The latter flaunted a pair of double length arms, the better to reach the high shelves and distant reaches of the container laden jet black back bar.Each of his hands featured eight nimble fingers capable of handling the most complex components of the bartenders art.For several minutes Mol watched both men at work before sidling over to sit across from the Natural.Being less busy than his counterpart he would have more time to observe, and more time to talk.Evening, ou man.Despite his youth the much younger man spoke with the practiced control and timbre of experience, as if his voice had been tuned like a piano.I wish you a short day and a long night.What will you have?Water.Mol was scanning the crowd that had washed up at the back of the room, human flotsam that had been left behind as the tide of daily life had receded.Away from the gyration floor there were tables and booths and time for moneyed wastrels to contemplate a multitude of whispered inanities.The bartender turned to feign a serious inspection of the rows of bottles and other containers behind him.Sorry.Were fresh out of that.Try again.Or you could go back outside.He nodded in the direction of the entrance that led to the street above.Harbors full of water.Ah.Humor.I appreciate humor.Mols voice was perfectly devoid of inflection.Since you insist, I will have a single shot of raki flavored with synchoc.Light on the phenylethylamine content, please.The Natural smiled professionally.Interesting call.You from around Istanbul?Having turned again on his seat to resume studying the crowd, Mol did not answer.The bartender shrugged, prepared the drink, and served it in a small glass at room temperature.Reaching behind him, Mol picked it up and sipped delicately; staring, watching, searching.There.Setting the half full glass back on the bar he passed his credit card across the sensor set flush into its side, not bothering to see if the transaction took.He was not running a tab and the bartender, busy with other customers, did not check to see if the old mans cred had been accepted.His attention was not necessary.Had payment been refused the alarm in the glass would have reacted by alerting club security.His informant had earned his subsist, Mol mused as he made his way toward a table located close to the back wall.Of course the woman sitting there by herself might be a completely different good looking tentacular Meld than the one he was looking for, but the bright red stripes that adorned her fingerless grasping limbs suggested otherwise.Mindful of her professional reputation, local though it might be, he halted on the other side of the table.It took a moment before she noticed him staring at her.Deliberately she reached out and wrapped the attenuated sucker lined end of one limb around the four sided quarter meter tall metal drink holder in front of her.I dont like men who stare.And old men revolt me.So you disgust me doubly.Find someone else to feel up with your eyes before I wash them out with alcohol.Mol was not in the least disturbed by the affront.Instead of complying he quietly took a chair across the table from her.Her right tentacle tensed around the drink container.He began patiently, speaking as one would to a child.Your name is Lindiwe.Together with an unfortunate companion named Terror and a self evidently incompetent European team leader named Chelowich you broke into the house business of a local witch doctor named Thembekile.You were seeking information on a pair of visiting Namericans whom I have found out paid her an earlier visit: a doctor named Ingrid Seastrom and a vapid male Meld companion who calls himself Whispr.I have attempted to get in touch with the witch doctor herself.This is at present not possible because the thoroughly botched intrusion by you and your friends has apparently unnerved her and sent her into deep hide somewhere else in the country.I am sure that I can eventually locate her but it will take time and much effort since she appears to have many friends and colleagues.Since you do not, it was far easier to find you.Being conservative by nature and in this particular instance more than customarily impatient, I naturally decided to begin by seeking the information I require from one who may already have obtained it.Mol essayed a trustworthy smile, an expression at which over the years hed had occasion to have considerable practice.Taken together with his age and general appearance this rendered his aspect positively avuncular.It certainly struck the tentacled woman as such, though not exactly in the way Mol would have preferred.Hard staring back at him she admitted nothing and confirmed less.Who are you, Uncle Serpent?My name is Napun.Although I do not work directly for SICK, I am what you would call an outside consultant.Despite his best efforts to control himself, both his gaze and his tone hardened slightly.You, on the other hand, have been working for someone other than SICK.That makes us competitors for the same information.She shrugged, one red striped tentacle rising slightly higher than the other.So youre right about that.So what?Personally, SICK makes me sick.I did not seek you out to engage in a debate on the morals of international politics or commerce or the prime movers thereof.Your opinions are your own and I am willing to respect them.While we may serve different masters, we do so from the same perspective.We are hirelings for the same purposes, you and I.  She made no effort to disguise her surprise and contempt.What?I dont think so, old man.He sighed understandingly.I have spent a lifetime disproving disrespect.He glanced around.I would rather not have to do so yet one more time in such crowded surroundings.However, you may rest assured that I will do so if necessary.But there is no need for that.Think of me what you will.He leaned slightly forward.I am prepared to pay for whatever knowledge you may have gained regarding the present whereabouts or intentions of the two named Namericans.As you have doubtless already been paid a likely half of what your own employers promised you, what I can offer should more than make up for what you have lost on this particular project.This time she did not dismiss his words out of hand.I lost a colleague.Boo wasnt only a fellow employee, she was a friend.Lindiwe made a spitting sound without actually expectorating, revealing a melded tongue that had been maniped so that it was fully prehensile.A younger man might have found that distracting.Not Mol.As for our team leader, she was forced on us by theby our employers.She was an arrogant out of town Natural bitch who thought she knew everything, and now shes dead.Her gaze met Mols without flinching.So some good came out of it.I care nothing for such individuals.They are more expendable than stale bread.As to your friend, I am sorry.He considered.I will double your employers death benefit.Lindiwes stare narrowed.Around them a radically melded assortment of humanity danced, leaped, osculated, fondled, cursed, and engaged in caressing and touching with a variety of limbs and digits both human and maniped.As he waited for a reply Mol ignored it all, from the pounding goolmech to the suggestive gestures to the occasional bemused stare that briefly flicked in his direction.What makes you think we learned anything?Lindiwe asked him.We were making progress, yebo, but we had to get out of there fast.The place was booby trapped to the ult.She shuddered mentally at the memory.Misleading tactiles, poisonous spidersthere are reasons why people leave sangomas alone, and they have only occasionally to do with old superstitions.Did you learn anything?Emotion deprived at the best of times, Mol continued to speak as calmly as if placing an order at the bar.Lindiwe found her gaze distracted by a pair of two meter tall local males each of whose heads had been severely maniped to resemble that of a horse.One man boasted a black mane and tail while the others maniped accoutrements were a Scandinavian blond.Both wore very little, the better to emphasize their additional stallion melds.These extended to regions beyond head and hair.At the moment they wore the expressions of men alone and not wanting to be.But first she had to get rid of this persistent old man.Wethe Europeanhad just opened files in the sangomas box when the spider flood arrived.She thought they were illusory.They werent.They killed her before she could do much in the way of digging.But you got away.I ran like hell.The door was secured so I went out a window.You ran.You are a coward.The way Mol voiced it the word hung in the air as a cold statement of fact, not an accusation.Lindiwe was young but not so inexperienced as to be so easily provoked.She ignored the implication.The bite of one button spider can kill.I prefer to say I cut my losses rather than that I ran.Mol did not pursue it.There was nothing to be gained by doing so.You say that Chelowich had just begun to open the sangomas files.I presume there were some that related to the visit of the two Namericans.I know it is difficult to read and comprehend while running (once again his tone was not accusatory) but were you able to see or learn anything?Anything at all?Get rid of him, an increasingly stimulated voice inside the tentacle womans mind insisted.Conversing among themselves, the impatient stallion Melds were threatening to desert the vicinity of her table.You keep saying youll pay.How much?Mol named a figure.No negotiations.You know its more than you deserve.She pondered, then nodded brusquely.Half upfront.To prove that youre more than just a babbling senior citizen.The rest after I tell you everything I saw.Now it was the old mans turn to hesitate.He disliked spending his employers money on goods unseen.But this worm armed woman was his only serious lead.He had been completely honest when he had told her that tracking down the sangoma, who had gone into serious hiding, would take time and effort.Communicator?Smiling, she drew it from a purse.As her device processed the proffered payment she turned her smile on the taller of the two nearby equine Melds.He neighed encouragingly and added an additional flourish with a becoming toss of his mane.As soon as the amount had been verified and entered into her account she placed the handheld device back in her purse and secured it.Several sentences flashed in the box field before it went dead, but I was moving fast and yes, I was scared, so I didnt exactly linger to read at leisure.In fact, out of all of it I just remember one word, and that only because it had been highlighted several times.Though quietly displeased, he reserved judgment.What was the one word?Rising, she let her left tentacle slide around the back of the blond horseman and her right around the waist of his contrasting companion.The pair of flexible limbs continued to coil around the exposed muscular bodies until they reached manip hardened abdomens.Both men looked startled at the unexpected ministrations.Then the blond smiled down at her, put an arm around the back of her head, drew her close, and kissed her.Pulling away, she grinned up at him, then over at his equally agreeable and expectant companion.Want some sugar, pony boys?Finding himself abruptly ignored at the table Mol raised his voice slightly.I just paid you a lot of money for one word.I will have it, please.The dark horseman, who weighed well over a hundred kilos, sneered at the elderly figure.I gives you one word, ikhela, and I no charge you for it.He proceeded to deliver himself of two syllables.The newly bonded trio of tentacles, tails, and temerity laughed uproariously.Mol quietly pushed back his chair, stood, and calmly addressed the speaker.I venture to say that your dick is considerably bigger than your wit.His gaze shifted to Lindiwe.The word.And if that is indeed all you have to offer then I must insist on a partial refund of what I have just paid you.Her lips parted in astonishment.The gall of the little ancient!Are you threatening me, old man?She looked first at the blond, then at his companion.Can you believe it?This old fart is threatening me.Leaving her in the embrace of his stablemate, the dark Meld came around the table.Even without the hooves that had replaced his feet he would have towered over Mol.Time to go, Gogo.Nothing left for you here now but more words.You keep pester this arm woman and you will get angry ones, and maybe also clip clop upside the head.Mol sounded tired.I did so not want this to be difficult.He jumped.Or more properly, he sprang.To their credit the two equine Melds reacted smartly.A professional, Lindiwe responded even faster.In a conventional brawl that would have been enough.Attracted to the action despite the clubs disorienting deluge of sound and light, other patrons could have been forgiven for considering the fight uneven: one unprepossessing old man against three much younger and bigger Melds.Sympathetic onlookers could have told him that there were easier and less painful ways to commit suicide, which was what he appeared bent on.Few of them were close enough to see the chromatic flash of cutlery that erupted from the oldsters hands and elbows.While unable to clearly perceive the cause of all the blood that explosively filled one corner of the big room, startled spectators had no difficulty discerning the results.As Mol completed his leap and landed behind the blond, the big horse Meld went down as if his bones had been soaked in acid.With both his femoral artery and jugular sliced, even advanced emergency medical procedures would have been hard pressed to save himand they were not available.Efficient as always, Mol did not waste time in contemplation of his accomplishment.Bloviation and the striking of heroic martial arts poses were for melodramatic popents, not real life.He engaged with the second big male before his first victims spurting torso struck the floor.Exposing body armor fashioned from dense maniped bone, the startled dark haired Meld parried his much smaller assailants thrusting hands.That left him vulnerable to attack from Mols feet.Pushing off on his right foot and making full use of maniped muscles, the frozen visaged old man kicked out with his left foot.A curving razor the full width of his foot snapped out from his shoes leading edge.Propelled by muscles both natural and enhanced, this weapon embedded itself in the horse Melds abdomen just below the navel all the way up to Mols ankle.As he dropped back toward the floor he twisted his body sideways.His left leg followed suit, as did his left foot.Landing cleanly on his right foot he dropped into a defensive fighting stance.Though not necessary given the blow he had just struck, this fresh posture was the consequence of a lifetime of skill and training.The remaining equine Meld looked down at himself, swaying slightly, and took a tentative step backward.His elderly assailant forgotten, the man dropped both hands to his stomach and pressed hesitantly inward.Turning and staggering toward the front of the club he kept both hands against his lower belly while he devoted his full attention to keeping his now revealed intestines from spilling out onto the floor.Having managed to avoid her interrogators initial attack Lindiwe had pulled a pair of handguns.Contrary to the more common fictional depictions of such confrontations they were different makes and models, the better to maximum the potential results.Each had been customized to be held and operated by tentacles instead of hands.Taking careful aim at the old man she fired twice.First one slug, then a second, penetrated Mols shirt and the toughened skin of his chest beneath, knocking him backward.Slightly slowed, both then struck the internal organic fibrous armor plates that had been grafted to his ribs and sternum.Manufactured of gengineered keratin grown from Mols own body (so that its natural defenses would not reject the internal grafts) and reinforced with carbon nanofibers, the plates stopped both shots as well as absorbing much of the shock.Even so, the impact was enough to cause his heart to miss a beat, but it quickly stabilized.His specialized and enhanced internal defenses moved quickly to englobe the fragments of the bullets to prevent infection.They would render the metal shards harmless until they could be removed.Lower level adepts like this snake arm never learn, he told himself as he fought to regain his footing.When dealing with an attacker always aim for the head.The body, even a small body, has too much available space in which to plant defenses.Her second sidearm fired poison darts.Unable to penetrate his toughened assassins epidermis they bounced harmlessly off him and fell to the floor.By this time he was moving sideways and had one of his own weapons out.Increasingly aware of the toxic confrontation that was escalating in their midst, Natural and Meld patrons alike had begun to scatter in all directions.The rising mad panic provided a percussive counterpoint to the pounding, throbbing goolmech that continued to pour into the club from hidden projectors.In the distance by the entrance a pair of two hundred kilo lods with low brows and bald skulls covered by sensor caps were trying to force their way toward the scene of the ongoing confrontation.Their progress was hampered by the crush of screaming patrons battling to reach the exit and a concurrent need to avoid squashing as few customers as possible.As two more shots and a second flurry of ineffectual poison darts came his way, Mol threw himself toward the floor.Shells and the plastic feathers that made the darts fly true shot over him as he fired his own weapon while still falling.His response of choice consisted of a single small pellet fired from the end of one maniped finger.Penetrating his targets skin and lodging in her flesh, the swiftly dissolving pellet delivered a rapidly dispersing measured quantity of modified histrionicotoxin that had been synthesized from the body of Dendrobates azureus.The consequences of this dosage of maniped lipophilic alkaloid took more time to manifest themselves than would a bullet or a fatal charge of electricity, but he did not want to kill the female hireling outright.Dead people were a notoriously poor source of information.Exhibiting no adverse effects from the pellet that had lodged in her gut, Lindiwe was still trying to get a clear shot at her tormentor.The fact that he was much faster on his feet and hands than she expected was complicated by the play of ceiling lights and wandering glowlos that played havoc with her vision.It took a moment or two before she finally spotted him hiding behind a table that had been overturned by other patrons in their haste to escape.She smiled to herself.No thicker than the radiant fibers from which it had been spun, the vit screen oval tabletop would pose no barrier to the slugs from the more traditional of her two sidearms.Pocketing the poison dart pistol she gripped the heavy plastic gun with the ends of both tentacles, ignored the pornographic offerings that were continuing to stream across the upturned table, and fired.Unfortunately for her aim, by the time her tentacle tip depressed the electronic trigger she was already falling backward.The shot slammed harmlessly into the ceiling, sending plastic and insulate flying.Fully alert but now completely unable to move, she landed hard on her back.As she stared helplessly upward a figure came into view.One hand scratching at the back of his head, her elderly assailant gazed down at her speculatively.There was blood on the front of his torn shirt where her earlier shots had struck home, but otherwise he seemed none the worse for wear for having taken two direct hits to the torso.He was so close.All she had to do to finish him off was incline the muzzle of the pistol still gripped in both rubbery limbs slightly upward and depress the trigger with the tip of one tentacle.But though they held tightly to the weapon her cephalopodian limbs would not respond.Bending over her the old man studied her face.He did not appear especially angry nor was he breathing hard.He circumvented his inability to pry the multiple coils of her locked tentacle tips off her gun by sliding a concealed blade from the left side of his left hand and simply sawing them off above where they gripped.Quivering like dying snakes, the bleeding ends continued to cling to the weapon even after they had been severed from her body.He tossed the mess aside and looked back down at her.You are externally paralyzed, he informed her unnecessarily.You cannot even close your eyes.She looked on in horror as a small aerohypo emerged from the end of another of his fingers.I am going to give you a small localized dose of the antidote.In addition to your heart and lungs, which for the moment continue to function, this will enable you to move anything from the neck up.Youll be able to blink and moisten your eyes, to move your tongue, and to talk.If you tell me what I want to know Ill give you enough of the antidote to allow you to recover fully within five minutes.Its a very unique toxin.The ability of the natural world to find ways to kill is still superior to that of melded man.What ?Her tongue and lips felt thick, as if they had been coated with liquid rubber.Both were still far from functioning perfectly, and coordination was an increasing problem.What do you want ?The one word.You say you remember seeing one word repeated inside the sangomas box projection before you fled her establishment.I paid you for it.A lot for one word.You can keep the subsist.Youllyoull give methe antidote?Breathing was growing increasingly difficult.She feared she was on the verge of swallowing and choking on her own tongue.Of course.He looked up and to his right.The two bouncers were drawing near, having forced their way through most of the remaining crowd.Quickly, please.She told him.He frowned.Are you certain?That was all Isaw.From the file.And like I told you, I saw itseveral times.Enough so that despite everything, it stayed with me.He nodded.Very well.I believe you.I also need to know who you were working for.Who hired you and your deceased friend and the incompetent woman Chelowich?Capable of movement, her eyes met his eyes.That was notpart of the agreement.He started to rise.We can renegotiateif you wish to take the time.No, no.Her eyes widened.It was the Yeoh Triad!He nodded thoughtfully.Unpleasant people.Very persistent, few scruples.Knowing of their interest now adds urgency to my undertaking.For the first time since he had presented himself at her table he gave her an honest smile.Pun is intended.Trembling inside, she stared up at him.Her chest was starting to hurt, as if one heavy weight after another was being layered onto her sternum.Despite the paralysis it felt as if little needles were being inserted into her lower throat.Needles with legs that were crawling upward.The antidote!He straightened.Im terribly sorry.I seem to have forgotten to bring some.In my profession I dont have much use for antidotes.You see, as far as my employers are concerned, I am the antidote.To foolish interlopers like yourself.Stepping over her immobile body he started toward the entrance, heading straight toward the approaching lods.She tried to scream after him, her tentacles and their bleeding amputated ends lying like expired anacondas against the floor.Youpromised!You !He glanced back at the helpless figure that was part octopus but still mostly woman.Dont worry.The toxin is still spreading through the rest of your body.It wont hurt when it reaches your heart.Unless it begins to affect your lungs first.That might be painful.Turning away he ignored her increasingly frantic mix of curses and screams.Finally he could relax.After missing his quarry in Florida and then in Sanbona he would no longer have to stress himself to track down the thieving doctor and her pathetic Meld companion.Because he knew where they were going.In one word, the Yeoh Triads surviving (for another moment or two, anyway) hireling had told him so.Namib, she had said.Surprising and unexpected as it had been to hear, the one word was enough to make the remainder of his task easy.He could now take his time.What they were attempting was impossible, of course, but if he had learned one thing about his targets it was that their resolve far exceeded their common sense.It was admirable, if self defeating.He would react accordingly.Namib.He shook his head.The world was full of crazy people.He knew this to be so because in his career he had met far more than his fair share.Prior encounters notwithstanding, Dr.Ingrid Seastrom and the man who called himself Whispr had to be the oddest as well as the most determined pair of fools he had ever dealt with.All because of a little storage thread that his employers desperately wanted returned.Not for the first time he found himself wondering what was on it.Then he released his curiosity like a little boy letting go of a kite.Someone who had mastered his particular skill set labored daily under a constant cloud of concern.There was no need to add to it by wondering about matters that did not concern him.His path blocked, he halted.The two bouncer lods were now directly in front of him.Each was enormous, their eyes almost disappearing into the flesh of their engorged faces, marbles sinking in pudding.Even their cheeks were muscled.They looked like overstuffed baby toys.If either of them got a solid grip on him they could pop him like a grape.Im leaving now, gentlemen.My preference is to do so quietly.Displaying natural oriental features, the older of the two lods would have made a fine Buddha stand in had he not been employed to subdue mayhem on a nightly basis.The figure confronting him in the now nearly vacant club was small, elderly, and deceptively self confident.Looking past the patrons patient, almost grandfatherly visage, the bouncers gaze rose to take in the overturned fixtures, the sliced and diced blond horse Meld, and the utterly motionless tentacle woman.A glance to his left showed a wide trail of blood leading to where a second horseman had collapsed on the floor only meters from an emergency exit.As if trying to escape the claustrophobia of his gut, entrails dribbled out between the Melds spread fingers.The two bouncers exchanged a look.Wordlessly they stepped aside, two mountains giving way in recognition of reality.Without glancing to either side, Mol took his leave through the valley between.Both lods tracked him with their eyes until he, like the rest of the evenings shaken clientele, had funneled out through the main entrance.He looked awfully old, declared the younger Meld.No, insisted his superior.Not old.Experienced.The two aint always the same.Turning back to the room that was still under assault by waves of numbing contemporary music he waved a thick arm.Lets get this mess cleaned up.Within the hour the House of Nasty was back in business as if nothing untoward had ever occurred within its unhallowed walls.The Sum of Her Parts     5 Ingrid woke up fast when Whispr screamed.It was a piercing, shocked sound the likes of which she had not heard before.In the course of their association her companion had done plenty of shouting, but this was the first time she had ever sensed true terror in his voice.Naked fear reverberated around inside his throat like a ball bearing caught in a pipe.Sitting up sharply she looked to her left.A hasty glance at his communicator, which had been placed on the ground between them, indicated that it was almost two in the morning.Feeling that lightning (or in this case flood) was unlikely to strike twice within the same week, and taking their usual care to conceal their heat signatures from possible passing SICK searcher drones, they had sought shelter at the bottom of a sandy dry creek bed beneath another jutting sandstone overhang.With no clouds in evidence overhead or hovering ominously above the mountains off to the east they felt that a repeat of the flash flood they had survived earlier was unlikely.Then what had prompted Whisprs ear vibrating screech?What is it, whats wrong?Having shot from beneath his thin but warming cover he was now standing stock straight in the center of the ravine.Moonlight unadulterated by haze or atmospheric pollution of any kind cast the impossibly slender Meld as a character out of Sleepy Hollow.Shaking visibly he raised a stick arm and pointed.Ghost!Its a ghost!He was pointing at her.Dropping her gaze to the front of her own blanket she saw nothing.Then movement, intermittent and rapid, caught her eye.Whatever had awakened her companion was making its way across her covered ankles.Barely visible in the reduced light, its outline confused her at first.Then she identified it, and having identified it, understood the reason for her companions panic.Having done far more reading about their intended destination than Whispr, she was able to recognize the intruder for what it was, and promptly relaxed.But not entirely.The dancing white lady spider was poisonous, and it certainly was as pale as a ghost, but it was not aggressive.Having migrated north from South America, far more dangerous arachnids now infested the lowlands of her home county in southeastern North America.Fascinated, she tracked the spiders pallid progress until it disappeared into the depths of the overhang.A nocturnal hunter, it was unlikely to retrace its steps and trouble them again.Turning, she smiled reassuringly at her still trembling associate.Its just a white spider.It wont bother you.She snuggled back down beneath her cover.Go back to sleep.He continued to hesitate.After several minutes of hard staring during which he failed to pick out the fast moving and now vanished arachnids path he finally returned to his sleeping pad and with considerable reluctance slowly slid back down into a prone position.Easy for you to say.It didnt go tiptoeing across your face.What if it had been something more dangerous?Then I would have screamed.She rolled over onto her side.Ive seen a lot worse on a biosurges table.Whispr was muttering to himself.White spiders.Black mambas.Whats nextgreen scorpions?She did not reply.Muffled in a dearth of sympathy, he closed his eyes and once more bemoaned his situation.Why was he here, halfway around the planet, trudging through open desert in expectation of imminent demise when he could be back home in Savannah, riffling tourists and sharing tall tales and short toddies with his friends?The answer had not changed any more than had the question.Because back home offered no prospects, no future, and no friends.Because back home the cops were looking for him.Because he had chosen to risk all for a chance to find the pot of gold at the end of a rainbow that probably terminated in hell.And because he had grown far, far too fond of a Natural woman who was so beyond his station that his train never even stopped there.Every breath of wind caused him to open his eyes sharply.Every imagined touch, contact, brush, and crawling sensation made him look down or flutter his covering.It was the middle of night morning and he was never going to go back to sleep.Not pills, not singsong, not anything was going to erase the tickling memory of the ghostly scuttling shape that had forged a methodical path across the angular topography of his face.He shuddered at the remembrance.Ten minutes later he was sound asleep.WHEN AGAIN HE FELT scratching sensations he held himself still.Blinking, he noted that the sun was almost up.This time he wouldnt panic.This time he would not scream, no matter if a hunting leopard was pawing at his hip.Whatever the cause, he realized quickly that it was having more impact than the comparatively delicate touch of the dancing lady spider.As he grew more and more awake he realized that someone was trying to tie his hands behind his back.They had been jumped by wildlife of a different kind.Struggling, he saw that Ingrid was lying nearby on top of her bedding instead of beneath it.She had been bound at ankles and wrists and padded tape had been slapped over her mouth.Her wide eyes were eloquent with fear.Still trying to wrestle with his unseen assailant a single horrifying thought crossed Whisprs mind and chilled his blood.Mol had found them.If the elderly assassin succeeded in binding him as well then he and the doctor were both dead.The only difference from falling off a cliff was that if they were suitably restrained Mol would take his time with them.That would be very, very bad.The assassin was serious evil personified.Whispr knew he had to fight back, had to get free.But though much stronger than he appeared to others he proved no match for the hands that were securing his arms.Even as he fought he was thinking that the parameters of the desperate struggle made no sense.Yes, Mol was strong and tough.But he was not big.The sheer weight pressing down on Whispr suggested someone far more substantial than the elderly killer they had encountered in South Florida.Twisting his body as he tried to free a hand, he finally glimpsed his attacker.It was not Mol.Nor was it a representative of company security.Satisfied with his handiwork, the panting freewalker straightened and stepped back from his prisoners.Enough light now penetrated the arroyo to reveal the unmistakable features of the Meld who had sought engagement as a guide as Whispr and Ingrid had been leaving Orangemund.The fleshy winglike water storage sac attached to his back sloshed audibly as he turned to check on her.Whispr used the lull to anxiously search the ravine in both directions.Unless others were concealing themselves farther down the gully or up top, their attacker was alone.Been following you ever since you left town.Quaffers gaze flicked back and forth between the two bound figures.Thought I mightve lost you in the flood.Glad you made it out.Your concern is touching.Whispr continued to fight with the plastic loop that had been used to secure his wrists behind him.Off to one side Ingrid had managed to struggle into a sitting position.The tape having finally slipped away from her lips, she glared at their captor.What do you want, Quaffer?Are you planning on selling us to SICK?The manta backed Meld looked shocked.Hell no!I dont want any more dealings with the company than you do.He indicated their surroundings.If they find me here they wont have to make any deals.Theyll just shoot me.And you too, of course.But you are not foolish peopleat least, not entirely foolishand I am sure you already know that.He leaned toward her, the water sac that was part of his back shifting fluidly.I dont want to hurt you.As I said back at town, I want to help you.Jerking his head toward his left shoulder, Whispr gestured with his chin.How about helping us out of these ties?The guide spoke without looking in his direction.Certainly, stick man.I will be pleased to do so.But not just yet.The multiple overlapping folds of his forehead slid toward Ingrid so severely that she marveled they didnt slide off his bald skull.First we must come to an agreement.I want a share.Whispr looked away, rolled his eyes, and said nothing.A share of what?Ingrid inquired blankly.The tiny deep set eyes glittered in the brightening morning light.Dont play the stupid with me, woman.The same thing we discussed on the dirt outside Orangemund.No more games, no more lies.He waved at their surroundings.Such things are meaningless out here.In the Namib only the truth survives.This is the Sperrgebeit.A company searcher could come by at any minute and we will all be as good as dead.But with my help you will survive.And with your help all this difficulty and suffering will be made worthwhile.That still doesnt tell me what you want from us, she protested.He sounded honestly bemused.I cannot figure out if you are strong or stupid.Myself, I think, inclines to the latter.His voice rose.A share of your diggings, of course.In return for my guidance and protection.A wide grin spread across the almost hairless face.It will be worth your while to engage me.Diggings?Torn between fear and confusion, Whisprs expression was as twisted as his tone.You mean diamonds?No, the much bigger man responded dryly.I mean cattle droppings.Of course I mean diamonds.There is nothing else in the Sperrgebeit worth digging.Lying bound on the ground Whispr started to chuckle.His characteristic straight faced laugh only served to infuriate their captor, but the slender Meld couldnt help himself.Having this water back idiot confront them outside Orangemund with such a ridiculous challenge had been unsettling.Finding that he had trailed them all the way out into the emptiness of the Namib on the basis of the same misguided premise was irresistibly hilarious.Quaffer found it less than amusing.Approaching the prone captive he drew back his right foot.Shut up!Shut up or Ill kick your head in!Preceding his response with a hurried cough, Whispr swapped hilarity for dead seriousness.Listen to me, freewalker.Im a poor streetie sweetie from urban Namerica.The only diamonds Ive ever seen are the ones locked up in arcades behind heavy security, secured in museums with even stronger security, or bouncing on the bodies of the rich who are too well protected for a street scavenger like myself to even think of riffling.Stones that are flashed by lesser citizens I dont try to apprehend because it takes an expert with specialized techrap to tell a real stone from a fake.I learned that early on.Hellup, these days stealing stones pays less than stealing bones.Theres a market for morrow marrow because you cant fake genuine organics.A rock, on the other hand, is just a rock.Easy enough to synthesize.I expect there are always those willing to pay for guaranteed real, though, or thered be no mining here.The guide listened to this so stolidly that Whispr was unable to tell if his logic had made any headway.At least the freewalkers foot descended without making contact with the slender mans spine.Such hesitation suggested that perhaps a word or two had penetrated the solid node balanced atop of the mans neck.Sensing vacillation on the part of their captor, Ingrid hastened to chime in.Whisprs telling the truth, Quaffer.Were not here after diamonds.We dont know anything about diamonds.I dont even own any diamonds myself.She hesitated.We cant give you shares in a nonexistent mine.The big man mulled over his captives words.Both Meld and Natural had spoken without being pressured to do so.Their expressions were earnest, their voices sincere.And yet, and yet If you are not after diamonds, he said slowly, then what are you doing in the Sperrgebeit?Whispr was quick to jump on the guides indecision.We told you, back outside Orangemund.Were scientists and weve come out here to Suddenly angry all over again, Quaffer glared down at him, his fury more a product of frustration than antagonism.Dont tell me you risk your lives to come to this place in search of wildlife!Dont insult my intelligence again!The foot drew back, farther this time.Whispr closed his eyes and waited for the blow.All right, Ill tell you!Dont hurt him!Both the man on the ground and the Meld standing over him turned in Ingrids direction.The restraining plastic band digging into her wrists, she implored their captor with her eyes.Ill tell you the truth.But it isnt what you want to hear.Try me.Lowering his booted foot for a second time, Quaffer stared at her out of eager, beady eyes.Dont do it, doc!Dont tellummphh!Aimed at Whisprs stomach instead of his head the forceful kick did no permanent damage.But it did shut him up.Holding his boot in reserve, the freewalker nodded tersely at Ingrid.Go ontalk.Youre right.Were not here to look at wildlife.Quaffer smiled contentedly.Of course youre not.Now tell me something I dont know.As best her restricted circumstances permitted, she nodded toward the gasping Whispr.My friend is my assistant, and I am a scientist.A practical one.She took a deep breath.We hope to sneak into a SICK research facility located at Nerens.Recovering from the punt to the gut, Whisprs eyes grew wide.Had his intellectually brilliant but socially nave companion finally gone over the edge?Now all their captor had to do was call SICK security and turn them in.No doubt there was some kind of standing award for those who exposed intruders into the Forbidden Zone.Except If Quaffer notified the company of their intrusion he would also have to explain what he was doing in the Sperrgebeit.They might let him off, they might pay him a rewardor they might execute him along with those he had exposed.Just to ensure everything remained nice and clean and that once back in Orangemund the wayward guide did not reveal to others of his ilk the safest route inland.No one would question the companys actions in such a case.Their ruthlessness and methods were long established and well known.Certainly such an extreme response would be unfair to the guide.Satisfaction carried to the grave, however, tends to wither as fast as flesh.To his credit the freewalker Meld did not reject Ingrids explanation out of hand.He ruminated quietly for several moments.Then he walked deliberately over to the doctor until he was standing next to her recumbent form.I give you credit, woman.That is the most outrageous pretext for risking ones life in the Namib I have ever heard.It is so outrageous that I could almost credit it being true.Almost.He leaned over her, his partially depleted water sac sloshing against his spine and expanded supporting ribs.Why in the name of Mandelas mandala would you even think of trying to sneak into Nerens?Unauthorized entry into the Sperrgebeit means almost certain death.Attempting to infiltrate Nerens removes the almost.Explain yourself to me, pretty woman!Gazing up at him out of recently color maniped eyes, she was quietly defiant.You dont need to know.With his insides churning Whispr waited for the inevitable heavy toed kick to strike his companion.That it did not was testimony to a combination of Quaffers uncertainty and his astonishment at being openly challenged by the helpless woman lying at his feet.His reaction, when it came, was unexpected.He laughed.Out of amazement, and out of a perverse admiration.I was wrong.You are not smart, woman.You are crazy!He looked over at the anxious Whispr.And whether you are following or leading, stick man, you are crazy for being with her!Lowering his voice he knelt on one knee to bring his face closer to that of his captive.Listen to me, red haired lady.Listen close, listen good.Nobody gets into Nerens unless they are authorized by the company.Nobody!People have tried.If you live in Orangemund and you pay attention, you learn that anyone who tries to do so ends up dead or worse.He was nodding as much to himself as at her.Yes, there are worse things than death.Rising, he placed his hands on his hips and shook himself, adjusting the water in the skin sac as easily as a Natural would reposition a backpack.I have had enough lies.It is getting warm and I am getting tired.No more lies.No more jokes.He lifted his right foot.But this time he did not draw back his leg to deliver a kick.Instead, he slowly lowered the sandboot until it was resting on Ingrids upturned nose.A great deal of crushing, shattering weight lay behind the deeply scored sole.Wherearethe diamonds?Where is the mine, or the field, or the alluvial deposit?His foot descended slightly.Unable to turn away, she felt the pressure.Her sinuses began to scream.As a doctor she knew in detail the succession of physiological events that would follow if he allowed all his mass to follow his foot.The crunching noise and the subsequent copious blood would be the least of it.More worrisome would be the direction the numerous bone fragments would take as they spread throughout her The boot wavered, moving slightly back and forth, and then slid forward off her face to land in the sand.He was straddling her now and swaying slightly.As he turned he reached for the pistol that was attached to his belt.His hand and fingers seemed to freeze.Hardly daring to breathe, she squinted up at him.Something was sticking out of the side of his neck.Several somethings.They looked like green needles.
