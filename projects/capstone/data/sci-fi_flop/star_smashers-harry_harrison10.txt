Supplied by the unlimited resources of Cotorra, they are unstoppable and unbeatable.And now the fleets will be combined.Everything has been planned from the beginning.There was one little hitch there when the Earthling appeared with the cheddite projector, but we took care of that as you see.We stole a projector and used it in battle so that the Fligigleh scientist could come up with a defense.We've done it, we've got it made, the galaxy is ours, we cannot be stopped and ...STOP!"He bellowed this last at John who had taken the golden sphere out of his shirt pocket and was about to press the button."I was waiting for that," Jerry Lortonoi sneered."This was the one weapon we were afraid of.Krakar.Now we know all about it, ha ha.So, go ahead and press the button!"But, strain as he might, John could not.His finger was only a fraction of an inch above the 'press me' button  but it would not descend.His body shook with the effort as he strained with every fiber of his being to push that finger down  but it would not!The Lortonoi brain was the stronger, and that evil creature was just toying with him, for it had absolute control.Struggle was useless.Chuck jumped to help him, but long before that help could arrive John watched, horrified, as his hand opened and the golden sphere dropped to the floor.Where the heel of his boot slowly ground it into gleaming fragments.Grinding all their hopes along with it."I said it was our ball game!"Jerry sneered victoriously."So, at last, in this moment of supreme triumph, we can at last reveal our presence and our real identity.I am here, among you, the Lortonoi you have been seeking.Do you not see me?"There was a shuffle throughout the ship as Ranger drew back from Ranger, eyeing each other with suspicion, fingering their weapons.Lord Prrsi eyed along with the others, and he used his immense mental powers as well."It is here," he muttered."I can sense that, but my mind is clouded by its presence, for the Lortonoi mental powers are beyond all others.Yet I swear I cannot find the enemy although I have scanned the minds of all here. ""All?"Jerry asked."Not quite all. ""Yoo hoo!"A powerful thought blasted through every mind at once."I see you!"Now their eyes were drawn across the room and down.Down toward the table.Down toward the bowl of water.Down to the little green turtle that was waving its tiny claws at them."Pishky ...you!"Troceps gasped."Lord Pishky, if you don't mind.Member of the Lortonoi Council of ten, now rulers of the galaxy.How we fooled you  and how we hate you!You, you great lumbering creatures with fingers and hands and tentacles and that kind of thing.While we, with the greatest brains the galaxy had ever seen, are trapped in these tiny worthless bodies.How we loathe you!We have tried to breed for size and such, but whenever we do, like the turtles we planted on Earth, size brings with it mindless stupidity, so that experiment has stopped.We decided instead to use our powers to enslave and destroy you all, and at last, after millennia of effort, the day of conquest is at hand.The Lortonoi have won!"After the first numbed surprise every creature in the ship surged forward, each fighting for the chance to get the Lortonoi under his heel.But their efforts were doomed.For, still laughing, the tiny green turtle gripped their minds and threw them back.It was defeat indeed."I don't want to die!I'm getting out of here!"John gasped, and turning the cheddite projector on himself, he vanished."The first rat leaves the sinking spaceship," Lord Pishky sneered, which is very hard to do if you are a turtle."He has gone back to the fleet, but since the fleet is due to be destroyed in a few microseconds, it will do him no good.Already we Lortonoi are taking over the opposing Fligigleh space fleets and making them one.How we have laughed at you from our security as your pets!We controlled your thoughts so that you liked us and kept us around, preparing yourselves for the moment of your destruction.Now the end is at hand, the fleet approaches, so if any of you want to have a last prayer  I won't allow it!Ha ha!How we hate you God freaks.Prepare yourself, for the end is at hand. ""Oh, no, it's not," John said, appearing suddenly in the middle of the cabin.He was dressed in a spacesuit and was carrying a sack over one shoulder."You'll never get away with this conquest, not while I have this!"He reached into the sack and withdrew a long, red, succulent shape and waved it over his head.It was a kosher garlic salami!20  THE SECRET OF THE SALAMI  "Are you out of your mind?"Jerry gasped, speaking for all of them, free to speak for himself again now that the Lortonoi no longer needed him for a mouthpiece."Not as mad as you think, Jerry, my boy.When you all tried to attack Pishky, the mad little green turtle Lortonoi, awhile back there, I had the glimmerings of an idea deep down.I acted instantly before Pishky could read my mind and while it was still mostly involved in holding you all off.I suppressed the thought and instead felt immense fear, which, you will understand, was not hard to do.Then I thought of escape, fleeing to the fleet, grabbing a ship and running, yes, I would do that!I turned the cheddite projector on myself, and the Lortonoi, fooled for the moment, let me go.But once back in the fleet, I abandoned all thoughts of flight and set about my real task.I got into a spacesuit and used the cheddite projector to go back to the space battle around the Chachka golden sphere.I almost didn't make it, the battle is raging worse than ever, but I managed to align the projector precisely and made it inside the dome in one jump.After that the rest is obvious.The Chachkas read my mind, discovered what had happened, and upon the instant decided that the time had come at last, after all the millennia, to use Krakar. "He waved the salami again."And Krakar is here, within the salami, which is a disguise. ""Well, it will never be used. "Pishky radiated the powerful thought, and instantly everyone in the ship was frozen."Except perhaps by us.Now  hand over that salami, and you, get a knife and let us see what this device looks like. "But no one moved, despite the waves of thought that radiated out from the bowl where the green turtleLortonoi swam around distractedly.There was a stir from the sack still suspended from John's shoulder and up out of it crawled a familiar, black, cockroach shaped form that stopped on his shoulder and stared down at the bowl."It is Three of the Chachkas!"Chuck shouted."We are saved!""Yes, you are saved," the creature said, "but no, I am not Three but Four.Three was busy.But I can handle this job myself.Know this, Oh, vile Lortonoi, we have been watching your evil race for millennia.Rather we weren't watching you, even our magnificent minds could not penetrate the mind barrier erected around your secret headquarters, but we were watching what you were doing and didn't like it at all.A long time ago we decided that if Krakar were ever used, it would be used against you swine, and our decision has proved correct.Now you have exposed your real identity so we can wage war upon you and destroy you down to the last fragment of shell... "Four's words were interrupted by a bolt of mental energy hurled at it by the creature in the bowl.So great was this thrust that every mind in the ship blacked out for an instant, and all the lights went out as well.Then the emergency lights came on, and they gasped as they saw the burned hole in the carpet where the strength of Four's brain had deflected the bolt."That was your turn," Four said calmly."Now it is mine. "With these words they were locked in silent, mental conflict, giant brain against giant brain.There was a tension in the air that they all sensed, for this was the battle to determine the fate of the galaxy.Who would win?The creatures, fighting turtle, gallant cockroach, seemed equally matched as the seconds, then minutes, flew by and there was no change.But was there?Why was Pishky swimming around the bowl in that agitated manner and trying to climb up the glass sides?Was that a tiny streamer of vapor rising from the water."Great Cacodyl," Lord Prrsi choked out."The Chachka is holding his own in the mental battle, I can detect that, but so mighty is its brain that it is diverting part of its mental energy to heat up the water in the bowl so that it is rapidly approaching the boiling point!"They watched in frozen silence as the tiny, yet extremely evil creature paddled about furiously as the water began to bubble.The end was not long in coming.There was a mental cry of despair that swept through their minds and then was gone  and with it went that evil presence that had sought to destroy them all."We've won," Jerry said, stepping forward slowly and picking up the bowl."Not only that, but we have some turtle soup. ""If you wanted some sandwiches, though how you could after that big banquet," Sally said, coming into the room, "why didn't you wake me and tell me?You know the kind of mess you always make.You want the salami on rye?"she asked, plucking the elongated form from John's fingers and putting it on the cutting board and raising a knife."Stop!"a number of voices cried at one time, and stop she did, since every mind capable of mind control was now fighting to control hers and to stop the knife from ascending.She bounced and jiggled, and the knife dropped from her fingers, and John bent and picked up the salami carefully."In my hands," he intoned, "I hold the fate of the known universe. ""I thought it was a kosher salami," Sally said, but no one was listening.With infinite care, under Four's mental instructions, he removed the skin and carefully made a long slice into the meat.Then, slowly and carefully, he reached into the opening and took out Krakar."If you hadn't told me, I wouldn't have believed it!"Jerry said, his jaw dropping loosely."Me neither!"Chuck agreed."It looks like a spray can of oven cleaner," Sally said, unimpressed."Its physical shape does not matter," Four said in no uncertain terms."For this is Krakar!""Could you tell us how it works  and quickly?"John said, eyeing the subspatial radar."Because the combined fleets of the Fligigleh are now coming this way at full blast"  "I cannot possibly explain to your childish minds how the device works, though of course there is a wiring diagram painted on the can.But I can tell you how to operate it and what it does.You hold it on one hand and point the orifice at the enemy and press the plastic button on top. ""I told you, just like stove cleaner spray," Sally said, but was glared into silence by the others and left the cabin, miffed."What Krakar is is a temporal catalyst that unites its target with the time flow that sweeps through the universe.But it unites it backward to the normal flow so that a blockade is set up.Well, as you know, nothing can stand against the time flow so the blockade instantly becomes a temporal tornado that whirls faster and faster and sucks in all matter for a couple of light years in every direction as it gathers speed; then, when it hits top revolutions, it blasts through the fabric of time itself and hurtles in reverse for approximately thirty one trillion years.... ""The figure is exact?"Chuck asked."Of course. ""Big bang?""Obviously, and I am pleased that at least one entity here knows what the hell I am talking about I can see by your bulging eyes and hanging jaws that I had better supply a little more detail.Not only must Krakar be used against a mortal enemy of the galaxy, but it must be used, and at that only used once.So you see why we were so careful about it Because the fleet of ships hurled into the past will pick up temporal energy on the way, and when it emerges at that early date it will explode with a really big bang and that will be the birth of the universe.I'll leave you to ponder on the philosophical permutations of that for a bit while I install this mind screen. "He dived back into the bag that John was still holding and emerged with a black sphere from which sprang a length of cord and a two pronged plug."You got a hundred and ten volt outlet here?"John pointed it out, then climbed out of his spacesuit to help him plug it in.The Chachka made delicate adjustments on the device, then threw a switch."It is working," he said."Now the Lortonoi will not be able to control the mind of anyone in this ship no matter how hard they try. ""What difference does that make?"Jerry asked."Since they'll be sucked into the temporal tornado in a couple of minutes. ""I will explain.You may recall that I said that the temporal tornado sucked in everything within two light years.Krakar has to be fired at a distance of one point nine light years from its target.So whoever fires it goes along with it.I suggest you draw straws or something and pick yourself a volunteer, quickly, while the rest of us get cheddite projected back to the fleet. "There was a shuffling of feet, backward for the most part, since the desire to get trapped in a temporal tornado and whisked back to blow up and start the universe going did not seem to be a strong one.But  there are some individuals who are big enough to face the idea of sacrifice for a cause, particularly for a cause as worthy as this one.These are the individuals who alter the destiny of worlds, and they are few and far between indeed.But when the need arises, they are ready to step forward, and step forward they do or the history of intelligence and civilization would not be where it is today.Not one.Not two.But three stalwart figures stepped forward grimly, volunteering for certain death, volunteering to die so that the universe might live."One will be enough," Four said."Who will choose between us?"Jerry said, and John and Chuck smiled at this, and as one man, they put out their hands and clasped them together, comrades all."We will do it together," Chuck said."It is our responsibility. ""The rest of you, go," John said."It sure has been nice knowing you. "Quickly the Galaxy Rangers filed by, clasping the hands of their leaders in silence, knowing that this was the greatest day in the history of the galaxy.Many eyed SlugTogath shook a tentacular good bye, web fingered Pipa croaked his adieu with a tear in each large eye, Lord Prrsi soaked the tip of his great claw in ice water  ignoring the pain  so he too could have it shooken by them, while Troceps, clacking his great beak with emotion, shook hands as well and gave each of them one of his wing feathers for a souvenir.It was a heart stopping, throat choking moment.And as each Ranger stepped away, the cheddite projector whisked him back to the fleet which was already in full flight before the coming thunder of the temporal tornado.Number Four of the Chachkas was the last to go, and before he did, he injected a single note of hope."I make no guarantees, but you will remember I said that you will be caught up by the edge of the temporal tornado.There is no escaping from the heart of the storm, but at the edge, once you are in it, you may be able to rewire Krakar to get you out.Maybe.No one of course knows, and it would take a genius to figure the thing out in time, but there you are.Even a billion to one odds chance, like this one, is better than no chance at all.So listen, say good bye quick because I see the space armada, the greatest the universe has ever known, tearing down on you at top speed, so I have to go. "And he went, and the good companions were alone."Will you look at that!"Chuck said, and look they did indeed.Space ahead was full, but full.Wall to wall spaceships.Ships such as had never been seen before away from the endless battle around Cotorra.Battleships that were twenty miles long and had gun turrets every eighty feet of their length.Ship after ship, fleet after fleet, squadron after squadron, all bearing down on the little shining form of the Pleasantville Eagle, every gun firing, every projector ravening rays, every torpedo zeroed in on them.Space was filled with hurtling death that rushed down on them with the force of destiny."You know," Chuck mused."It makes you feel kind of humble. ""It makes me feel like pressing the goddamn button," Jerry said."Only three more light years to go," added John."Well, you might have told me," Sally said; walking in with a great plate of salami sandwiches."Here I've gone to all this trouble and everyone has left. ""I thought you went with the others!"John gasped."And that you were crying too hard to say good bye. ""Send her back with the cheddite projector!"Jerry shouted, diving for it."No time!"Chuck said, finger ready on the button."One point nine light years exactly...now!"He pressed the button down savagely, and the can hissed slightly, and nothing else happened."It doesn't work!"more than one voice cried out, but more than one voice has been wrong before.Because something was happening out there in interstellar space.Something that absorbed the energies of the ravening rays, rockets, shells, and torpedoes, eating them like candy, absorbing them into what can only be described as a black hole in the blackness of space, a new kind of blackness that hurt the eye to look upon.Beyond the hole the space armada sent out thousand mile long plumes of fire as they tried to brake and change course, but they could not.With frightening speed the black hole grew, absorbing them, eating them, growing larger all the time.Then, as ihe last great ship vanished, the blackness rushed out toward the Pleasantville Eagle, and Sally screamed at its terrible presence, and it was upon them.For an unmeasurable instant time went mad.First it froze, and they were paralyzed and felt their hearts stop beating and the clocks stopped and even the molecules of matter stopped spinning.And then everything reversed.It is impossible to describe the sensation, except to say that it was not a nice one.They staggered, released suddenly from the temporal paralysis, and it was Jerry who pointed out the front window and shouted, "Look!"What a sight!Here at the rim of the temporal tornado it was relatively calm.Just an occasional bump when they ran over a minute or a clatter on the hull when they sailed through a cloud of seconds, nothing to bother over.But in the heart of the tornado it was a different matter!All the ships were being whirled about and buffeted together, glowing hotter and hotter as they did, already beginning to melt and run together into the primordial matter that would explode and form the universe."Might I ask just what is going on?"Sally asked."Let's get to work on the diagram," Jerry said, and an instant later he and Chuck were bent over the table scratching out equations.Therefore, it was John's unhappy duty to take Sally by the hand and take her aside and explain what had happened.She instantly burst out crying, and he let her weep upon his shoulder and stroked her smooth hair and made soothing noises.Soon her crying became a soft sobbing, and then she wiped her eyes and attempted a weak smile at him, and he smiled back and took a salami sandwich  he knew she would like that  then he took a second and a third and wolfed them down because this sort of thing gave him an appetite."Great sandwiches," he said, kindly."Thanks, John, I did my best. "The little smile played across her tear stained features and was as quickly gone."But do we stand any chance at all of getting out of this thing?""Well, the odds are a billion to one, and those aren't what I call great betting odds.But Jerry and Chuck are geniuses, and if anyone can put Krakar into reverse gear and get us out of this, it is those two guys.Great guys. ""They are.And you are a great guy too. ""Aww, you're just saying that because it is the end of everything. ""Maybe, but one can't lie when everything is coming to an end?I feel honored to be loved by three such great guys as you three.Yes, John, I know, it was easy to tell, there is no need to blush and turn away.You are blushing, aren't you?Yes, I thought so. "She took his great hand in her tiny one and squeezed just as Jerry jumped up shaking a piece of paper and shouted."Eureka!""What does that mean?"Sally gasped."I don't know, it's Greek.But we have it.Chuck did the math, and I have worked out a new circuit.Now, a bit of quick work with the old soldering iron, and we will see if the theory works. "He was as good as his word.They cannibalized some of the gunnery controls for spare parts, and within minutes he had breadboarded up a new circuit and opened up Krakar with a can opener and wired it into place."This is it," he said grimly, as he made delicate adjustments on the controls."We will use the angular momentum of the tornado to hurl us backward in time and, since we are not going backward, that backward will really be forward, so we should be going in the right direction, back where we came from.After that it will just be a matter of cracking out of the time flow at the right place.All right, all set.Will you do the honors, Sally, darling?We foolishly got you into this, and let's see if your sweet finger will be the one to get us out of this.Press here. "She smiled at them all, blowing little kisses in their direction, then pushed delicately on the doorbell button that had been wired into the circuitry to actuate it.Instantly everything went black.Outside, that is, but inside the plane it was as it was before, except everything seemed to move sluggishly, and it was an effort to do anything."Fighting...against...the current of time... "Jerry said, forcing the words from his lips.It was like moving through a sea of invisible molasses  but moving they were, for the time dial was slowly turning in reverse, and as it moved, faster and faster, their movements became easier until they were almost normal again."Wow!"Sally gasped, then sat down."I don't want to have to go through that again!""You may have to when we get out," Chuck said, mumbling over some math."There we go past one million b. c.  Better get ready.Jerry, better adjust the frabbislator, see if we can come out near Earth. ""Right, it's done.Get ready, everyone  better strap in, because this might be the rough one. "Strap in they did, and the tension mounted as the needle spun.Back through the age of the giant saurians, the coming of the mammals, the emergence of man.Then Egypt, fiery Atlantis sinking, great Greece arising, a certain son of a carpenter born in Galilee, Roman orgies, bold King Arthur, the Dark Ages, the Magna Carta, knighthood in flower, the New World, the Industrial Revolution, pollution, world war, world war again, cold war, faster and faster and...."Now!"Jerry shouted and pressed.With a sickening crunch the great 747 plunged through the time barrier and into the midnight sky of Earth.But the transition was not an easy one, for the time barrier is more solid than any sound barrier.Vibration racked the ship; equipment tore loose from its solid mooring; the right wing broke in half and hung, flapping, from a few remaining shards of metal.The left wing folded back over the plane with a horrifying crackling sound.The tail broke and almost fell off."Not bad," Chuck said, smiling."We came through, and we're not dead yet.Where are we?""About thirty thousand feet up and falling fast," John said, tapping the altimeter."I see lights down there, a city of some kind, and we're dropping right down on top of it. ""No point in trying to start the engines, is there?"Jerry laughed."Not without any wings. ""No point at all," John agreed, looking out at the solid Earth that was rushing up toward them.Sally screamed.21  VICTORY WRENCHED FROM THE SALIVATING JAWS OF DEFEAT!"Sally, Sally," Chuck said tenderly, patting her shoulder."Now don't worry your pretty little head.We'll think of something.We have plenty of other gadgets aboard the ship.For instance the cheddite projector.... ""Try again," Jerry said, picking up the bent and crushed projector from under a piece of heavy equipment that had fallen on it.They tried, but it didn't seem to be much good.It was John who finally thought of the magnetic rays and who tore open the control case on the projector and exposed the interior wiring."Look, guys, if this is a magnetic attractor ray, why can't you reverse the thing and turn it into a magnetic deflector ray and stop our fall with it?""Twenty thousand feet up," Jerry said."A great idea.Hand me a screwdriver, someone. "Tension filled the air while he sweated and worked."Ten thousand feet and falling fast," Chuck said to cheer him on, then ignored the viciously snarled answer."You know," John mused, looking out the window at the ground rushing up toward them, "I could be wrong, but that sure looks like Pleasantville down there. ""You are right," Sally gasped."I can see the school, and my father's house, and there is the airport with a plane ready to take off. ""Five thousand feet," Chuck observed."How does it look, old buddy?""One more connection  there.Strap in everyone. "They did, and at two thousand feet altitude he pressed the button.The sudden deceleration hit them like a solid blow, and the fabric of the great plane screamed in protest.Things banged and crashed, and both wings fell off but remained hanging from the plane by pipes and cables and such, while the broken tail now fell off as well and hung in the same fashion.Deceleration grabbed them and crushed them, then eased up and vanished altogether."Phew," John said, "we're less than a thousand feet up and hovering. ""And right over the airport too.Hold it there a mo, Jerry, there is another plane taking off, going by right under us why...look!"They looked  and gasped  for the other plane was the Pleasantville Eagle!"I don't understand this," Sally said as the plane rushed by and was gone."Did you see who the pilot was?"John asked, shocked."Why ...it was me!""I think I know what has happened," Chuck said."We timed our arrival back in our own time a little too precisely.So it looks like we have arrived back on Earth just before we originally took off.That is us going off, kidnapped by John. ""And the great adventure begins," Jerry said, looking after the great 747 now vanishing into the darkness."If only we knew what we were getting into!""Don't tell us and ruin the fun!"John said, and they all laughed and the plane gave a sickening lurch and dropped."Wiring shorted!"Jerry cried, then labored over it.Down they went, down and down, and they were just feet above the runway when he fixed it.He could slow their descent but not stop it and the plane crashed into the hard concrete with a horrendous crunch and instantly burst into flame."Save Sally!"someone shouted."I have her!"John called out, tearing her safety belt open and throwing her over one shoulder."Take care of Chuck  he's been knocked cold!""I have him!"Jerry shouted, tearing open Chuck's safety belt in the same manner and shouldering his heavier burden.Thus laden, they staggered through the smokefilled cabin to the exit ramp, which luckily had been jarred open by the crash and now reached down to the ground.Down it they went, with the flames licking at their very heels, and into a staggering run across the dew wet grass.A welcome drainage ditch gaped before them, and even as they fell into it, the gallant old Eagle exploded with a roar of flame.And a crackle of shells as well, as all the ammunition went up."We made it!"Jerry gasped."And what a grand show the old Eagle is making  what a way to go!"The pyrotechnics lit up the entire sky and threw a flickering glow onto their faces as Sally opened her eyes."Safe," John said, simply, and in the instant she was in his arms, and their lips met, and they embraced.Sally liked to kiss with her eyes open, so she could see, over his strong shoulder, that Chuck had come to as well and that Jerry had taken him in his firm embrace and that they were kissing as well, passionately and long.Since John and Sally had started first, they ran out of breath first, and their lips drew apart, but their arms still remained about each other as they sat and watched Jerry and Chuck slowly disengage.The two boys looked up and realized they were being watched, and, blushing, drew away from each other."No, that's all right," Sally said, smiling with understanding."I've known for a long time that you both were AC DC, and I was waiting for you to make your mind up which way you were finally going to jump.I know why you kept that cot in the laboratory. "She laughed, and they laughed too and looked deep into each other's eyes and drew together again."Not that I blame you, boys will be boys, and sometimes girls, but gee, that's what life is for.Loving I mean.In any case I have found the man I adore, and as soon as he asks me, we are going to be married. ""Marry me," John breathed."Yes, darling  just as soon as you grow a kinky beard and sideburns and a natural.Then you will look like you, and I will love you the more. ""Gee," John mused, "I don't know, darling.I had thought I would go down in the morning to the on campus branch of the friendly CIA and hit them up for a job.I bet they'll pay a lot for my specialized know how and stuff. ""That is not the sort of work I would enjoy seeing any husband of mine doing," Sally replied coldly."Leave that to the squares along with this mean minded little town, and we will go to the big city and swing.Decide darling. "She wriggled her hips deliciously and licked her full, moist lips while staring sensually from below half lowered lids."Me or the CIA ...?""Grr," he growled, pulling her unresisting body to his, his clawed fingers sinking deep into her fulsome rump."A gold ring in my ear and more hair than you ever saw before. ""And you won't mind if I join fem lib and picket segregated male toilets and things?I've had about enough of the second class citizen get your ass back into the kitchen you poor little thing around here. ""Put that ring in my nose for all I care, honey.I am yours for life. ""That is very sweet of you to say, and I won't forget it, but will keep it sort of fifty fifty if we can.And what about you guys?"she asked, turning to the other pair of unabashed lovers."Back to school," they said together, then burst out laughing."I have a couple of more degrees I need," Jerry said,  "and I want to try out for the debating team. ""I have some more credits I need," Chuck added, "and I do really want to try out for the shot put.Can we room together, Jerry, honey?""Sure  I wouldn't have it any other way. ""Do you realize," John mused, looking at the flames of the burning 747 that were beginning to die down, "that it is as though it never happened. ""As though it were all a dream," Sally added  "But it really happened," Jerry told them."But it must be our secret.We can tell no one, or they would think us mad.We'll have to tell them that the ship crashed on takeoff. ""If the insurance won't cover a new plane, why, Dad will pay for it," Chuck said assuredly."Our secret," they said together, and joined hands, one over the other.And then the Great Adventure really was over, and hand in hand, the two happy couples walked away across the dark field, walking into the future, heads high, knowing that they had been tried in the furnace of life and had emerged triumphant and well tempered to face anything that that future held in store.
