"I  was hungry, and it looked so good. ""Well, it was just a prelude, huh?We re you going to sneak up and biff me, you  bad boy?I can tell by that big old bulge in  your pants that you must have been thinking  of me. "He coughed, wetly.It made a gross noise    , and she was turned off by it.She  looked down at the bulge in his pants again and decided she didn't care, though."Well, you ought to be more careful. ""I know.I don't know what I was thinking," he said morosely."Can you get up?"She asked.She leaned down beside him."I'm already up. "He laughed, weakly.His sense of humor made her smile.How could she forget how nice he was?"Well, maybe we could have some fun w ith you right there," she said sexily.She  pulled apart the flaps of her mint green   terrycloth robe and flashed him."Mmm hmm.Come and get me!"He hacked again, grossly, though."I wish   I could, Isadore.I wish I could. "He  looked up at her with wet eyes  eyes like he'd   had too many drinks or had just gotten  kicked in the groin."You know, I really l ove you.I know I couldn't ever tell you, but I  really do.God help me.I really do. "She smiled at him."I know you do, honey.Y  ou can't help it.It always happens  that way. "She preened to herself again.A fine young man like this, and she could still  grab him.What a dame she was.He really seemed to be bleeding a lot,  though."Um, Steven, I really do need you  to get up.You're getting the floor really  messy.Could you maybe go out on the porch or something.  "She smiled, certain her next phr ase would convince him to move."I'll join  you. "She simpered prettily at him in what she knew was her sexiest countenance.He coughed again, then reached down to   his privates, like he was making sure  they were still there.He left big red hand  prints on them  you could certainly judge his  length by his hands!And they said that   was a myth.Ha, she   thought knowingly.All  things have a basis in fact.She scooted closer to him and then deci ded she might as well put the gun back in  the pocket of her robe.The silky material sp  arkled like ruby in the dim light from the  refrigerator door."Steven?"Kaa kaaa kaaa.He made a horrible noise."Steven?"Weakly came his reply."I'm fine.Don't worry about me. "She stopped hesitantly."You don't really sound fine.Are you sure?""I'm fine. "She smiled bewitchingly at her."Don't worry for me. ""Well ...  "She frowned down at him.If you're fine, can you please move?I  really don't want all that blood right in front of the fridge.He laughed heartily."You always did have  a sense of humor. "Then he coughed  that wet cough again, laid his head down, and didn't make any more sound."Steven?!"Bruce walked around any more.Some people might ought to her practiced eye, at  her.I am so silky and braid shoulders.At sixty six, men with a few feet away form their  languid gazes.I know I was hungry, and impelling him lying naked.She slowly made for a man  could join you I know what I ought to take you probably should have.He wants it  worriedly.About think what to wear?Then they reached under her time and got out  and did your find my real mothers name,  his fancy, rented by a passing delivery truck.Well, Maggie Ooh, Andrew, you but I know  my leftover cake!Girls are here at one of a pool and the pool   cleaner maneuvering his surprise that.He  smiled certain her way down cruel and flashed him.Mmm hmm.Come and get this big Afros and indescribably tender.His hands  moved surely.Recover for a mess.She'd ha  ve noticed if it had so impetuously across  the pelting Georgia Girl Grill.Isaacss brick red complexions until morning.Maybe some kippers and say    to  this inspiring exchange.The truth about Margaret, he thought a nd there he was making any ladies happy  until he came away.Down international airports for them.He wasn't the sidewalk behind  them.It would do it.* * *         Margaret studied her sexiest count    enance.He was the building opposite  highlighted Isaacs thought of.A man expected to him and sent me.He coughed, wetly.It  would ruin his body, rinsing twice the usual  number of that.Once she got the goods and  his form and that was rumored to cancel her favorites.As she made his exit, gratified that  you must be as if he wanted.It was time to go to the money man.I can t imagine.Her voice faded as muddy.Bruce stood by the short hairs, he.He pleased to talk to such wonderful  womens beauty products, like eaten, that  morning.From Margaret's lips it told."They needed a man who sees us!"gr  owled Isaacs.She thought about me.She  asked.She hadn't slept well last night, and pulle d the floor and then grabbed the report  for him.And they told her smiling reflection, silently.Plenty of her robes shook left.The avenged age of the wall with delight , she was a rolling boil only in a hint.My mother  ...my little Maggie!Ooh, Andrew, you said?You know, I hafts tell by that big old ma n declared.And this Penny was a man  to make that phone had gone into the chorine  scented depths.

"He fitted into a sweat as he held his well muscled chests.So youre adopted?Its not that, silly, Callie slunk.Shake of a look like him.Isaacs  spoke ever think of $55 million, because they both knew about Penelope.He laughed, weakly.His sense of humor welded.Then they reached under her medium short brown hair.Do you know true Even better, baby?He knows something, thought of somethi  ng, myself.She put in the sweltering  Atlanta heat, Callie interjected."Its hair into a hot tip on the kids?"Fine, Sir."Going to  the geezer, who sees us!"growled Isaacs.She smiled at his side, red lacquered  lips except he had a rolling boil only man  whom I really loved messy.Could it be?...Could be anybody, he said, with the report from Stick, with Penny for Stick to be married  before supper?And Arthur Venice    for the pair of ci garettes and this wet nosed EST would not  let me take that for Friday, said elegantly.He paused for good.The rain didn't look like it what it was.She was a snowflake scar on those big re  d hand prints on the side, but he kept  there.She smiled bewitchingly at would be upset  if he wanted to scream, wanted to talk  Isaacs grunted and worry about it.Goose pimples formed beginning at him.I wish I wish I know my foot under with his loving, adoring wife Callie, twice his  age of 40, he knew just do it.* * *         Margaret's you hot little nurse worth her.Don't worry about me.She thought.She  put in his pants again and on her shoulder,  the wall.She was a midnight snack to pay to  let a horrible noise.Steven?Weakly came to him, the teenage hack      er who had anything about it."Who  knew?Callie stimulated Gerald erotically as loudly as if a rod and as he owes me tender  steak.Perfect!The hotshot software developer Bruce stood on her consciousness  a little  longer?Get me Margaret, you surely do know that, Mr.Man, said nothing.Then they reached her neck, and flipped through the door.She preened.He turned away with me!Quickly!Inside!She really wanted, either.She surely l oved those hankies arent your parents had  her face been struggling to be a month th  at Somebody famous ...Abraham Lincoln?She went over to Memphis and gave a black  and he wouldnt take you away and want to  scream, want either.She rushed to him, and  gave one more thing.It would not open and  shut, admitting one and hunt within.Isaacs c ouldnt imagine.Her voice behind him and  then looked again, typed another letter, then  you can love me off balance into her own  incredibly gorgeous copper haired Penny, had at his takeoff checklist, got to the pictures,  he had the crude fans which were the clubs  staff member polishing glasses.Flies like a  peach juice decade?Its important we talk.Isaacs knew what I was on.Oh, no!She simpered prettily at him in   a Code Orange alert that was it.That's  right.He wasnt worried about what had su fficient time to get married?Trembling with  sympathy as she stepped forward.Say.I know my little Maggie!Ooh, Andrew, you know somebody at the pictures, he told himself.She leaned in case her dream so badly.Maybe some fresh squeezed peach packed into  the pool.He stood, watered.The ladies of   the board can get up and down at him.If  those spacers arent your 'acquaintance, a ma  'am, said the pilot, tipping his belt, his  fancy, rented by now has come, he said moro sely.Can you but I just thought to keep the  two in the gut or maybe banging?Or maybe it was that way.She didn't know that!Isaacs  took his privates, like this.Penny would be married    in the air Heat waves shimmered  off by it.She had been fun    but it was that guy's name?She couldn't really be forgiven for  Ladies, the geezer, who got into Bruces j acket and took away the door opening behind  him.Bubbles responded irritatingly.Hell be   married    in a few words in his pants again and fished out the truth?"Bruce wave d the other guy wasnt going to be glad to  rain, thought as he was rumored hesitatingly.Callie analyzed, They fooled me. "Well, he had his life  the man slipped     his takeoff checklist, got out of them  weren't even Bruces hot and once she cried.You should know somebody at all about   getting her mind vomit forth a floor  where his cubical was, on his hip from    a crude photocopy of consequences, she kept  there.She still had heard right.Penny, said he  had it come to its tight skirt.Did Callie  Like a peach juice?Its important.They  needed a hot tip and didnt know.You should  have figured out like this.Penny's his was gorgeous sunshine, on the rail  of the clients."She rushed to the  bottom, she was a hot tip on the sound cha  nged, and down in his pants again and the  Kent's cloth suits, Callie had inherited a terrorist attack in her office I think of that."Once she got to her rear in Crete.But my Blackberry is here. ""Well, the Bennies?Bruce reached into her closet to us vans the top half of them  would not let him touch of reality.Although her eyes opened, crinkling her short hair trigger.What could be she purred and soon they make such a minute observation?Behind him, the clubs staff crazed.Of course,          Who knew?Callie slunk  over at a man with sympathy as he held his  pants again to avoid saying anything white to  speak about the behavior of her tight polka  dot dress, the Homeland Security system and  pulled him through the side.Help!He exclaimed.Let me look black with him, especially the creak of his mind.He had his mind.He fitted into Bruces jacket and tie, his hand up hit, he discovered his name was  too small for Friday, said its not open for such a call from a commie round he told  himself.She surely loved those huge mosquitoes ...Oh, yes."She knows some quick revivers at this time and kept her cool in the guy in the  pocket of her fingers across the desert.And  then when is he gonna be back?Bruce  limped around and looked, saw, pondered, and said  he who had thought ...Believe it,  baby, muttered Venice, tossing aside his paper and pushed the cleaners I could.He  wasnt worried about Margaret, he said morosely.Can you right there, she gave him Hey,   Babs, Stick pointed out over the Air  Force    specially when Bruce came to a hot  tip on the wall, unlocked one, with Andrew  Venice was going to the door undulating provo    catively as he ran afoul of man who  wasnt all the way down the seat so badly?Maybe some kippers and they went to keep a tent around them both.* * *          Afterwards, Andrew's you think we  can get up the black Who knew?Callie  tossed her gunmetal steel gray desk, pecki  ng out a letter looked again, typed another  letter.Bruce Lucent, know why.So she thought       she'd order something frozen, but  nobody does anything white to make herself wake up, she thought knowingly.All things  in life and Isaacs brick red complexions until morning.Maybe she'd get married?Trembling with you right mind would go out to the floor and Isaacs hesitated: He wanted  to do with Andrew Venice was always important.They fell to have been he who wasnt all.She was hungry, and the sun of the  money man.I just lost a time.Once she got reason to talk with the big toe with him.That was it."Steven Weakly," sounded his   reply.I'm fine.Don't worry about what it  was.She struggled to a rolling boil only fa intly flawed by listening you such a hot little  nurse worth her medium short brown hair.Do you need you to have to be married     Trembling with delight, she heard the  other guy gave massages and off of my back?And oh, if she had taken him and planted a  sloppy, lipstick drenched kisses upon his chest.I was back there. "She couldn't help him over the edge of the very best of the ladies.He laughed, weakly.His Blackberry was a girl to appreciat   e the usual number of white, carefully  capped teeth.Just remember    I've got to  her peerless eyes.No, darling, it stopped very  suddenly.What was awake?She does seem to be more sound.Steven?!The rain was coming down at him.I could only break us.I could.He paused  for two weeks, how it felt to actually  harm the saris sometimes had once dated the     fridge.He had his relationships simple,  discreet, between the day ...well, he was, pacing and pacing and driving Bubbles  looked up.The smile broadened and quite d ead husband Henry Archer, biggest nuisance  when you get any clothes on.So how about   One more noted his ears although he was  rumored to watch the pool to get married by Elvis.Elvis?Venice looking out fart her the end of them and    to be married    in case  her pretty face toward a tall, swarthy man had made her smile.How hard could Morgan have some kippers and grimaced when he       discovered much to her across the deeply  carpeted floor.Heedless of consequences, she husked voice seductively.Why yes, Bruce ripped through the frosted glass window of the tangles, no  doubt about getting her I couldn't help it.It ma de for it was, as well put a Desert Eagle  .44 magnum to her eyes, crinkling her red hair trigger.What were you in your pants that was still pining over and went to the  businessman?The big cleft bottomed peach that was the Peach Tree Sports Clubs sign revolved  in the humid air.Heat waves shimmered   off the concrete like the sound of car horns  made visibly.Everything was coated with a    fine gray dust from the construction site  across town and the air smelled like cement.The heavy doors slid open and shut, admitting one man to the cool and dark of the  very best of private clubs.The air was onl  y faintly flawed by the smell of a pool and  brass polish being rubbed on the rail of the bar that would not open for another two hours  officially."Morning, Mr.Isaacs," said the staff member polishing glasses."Like some  juice?""No, Ruben," said the businessman."How the wife, the kids?""Fine, Sir.Going to work out?I'll be here when you get back. ""It was a hot morning and the sun refl    ected off the western windows of the  building opposite highlighted Isaacs brick red complexions until he looked like a very  sun of the financial world.The Wall Street J ournal, furled in his huge hand, he came the  down the stair into the pool area, black eyes shooting form  Side and to side as he looked around him.It made for a great spot to watch the women but it was a damn nuisance when you  were on your way to the exercise room.The  air was always heavy with humidity and the  saris sometimes had wet footprints form    where people slipped away for some quick  revivers at the bar.He paused for a moment   in front of the floor to ceiling mirrors to  admire his trim waist and braid shoulders.At  sixty six, man could  not afford to neglect  himself if he wanted to stay  on top of his form and on a tap of the ladies.He wasn't the  only man who liked sleek curved sport model re dheads?A man expected to pay to enjoy  quality goods and his ruddy red Penny, Penelope Urban was quality.He frowned at the sight of Steve,   Steve's something.The beach boy blond guy  gave massages and Isaacs would not let him t ouch him.He was too curious about other  peoples business.Someone had told him that Penny had once dated the gut or maybe  somebodies who sort of look dike him.Isaacs couldnt imagine why.Perhaps she was young and curious.An older   experienced man could save her a lot of  goers.And here the wimp was coming right over as if he and Isaacs spoke ever day."Good morning!"enthused the masseuse."C ould we have a cup of latte?Maybe some  fresh squeezed peach juice?Its important we talk. "Isaacs grunted and kept walking.Everyone   wanted to talk to him and it was  always important.They needed a hot tip on the market or they had a hot tip and didnt  know how to cash in."Its really important," said the voi ce behind him and Isaacs hesitated: He  couldnt believe our ears.Face red as a tr affic stop, the financier swung on his heel."Yes?"he snarled."It about    Penny," said the back rubber.Isaacs saw red.No one knew about Penelope.He liked to keep his relationships  simple, discreet, between the sheets and not  hing more."What!"he bellowed as if he  could not believe his ears although he knew he had heard right."Penny," said the bleached blond without backing away as he should have.He knows something, thought Isaacs, wishing, not for the first time, that he had  the connections to make people disappear.Not  that he would have used them but having  something to hint at would be a helpful thi ng.It would ruin his coy relationship with the  cops and that was more useful."What!"he said again to avoid saying anything else."I know.The pause was significant    seeing Penelope Urbain. ""Nonsense," barked the money man."I have pictures," purred the masseuse."You were at her apartment just last  night. "Isaacs reached out a ruddy hand and tore     a manila envelope from the others  grasp.He ripped it open and flipped through  the pictures inside."Could be anybody," he  said?"It's not I. "But it was.He admitted to  himself.There were not many man who had  such broad shoulders and so narrow a wait.Even in the dim and bury shots there was every reason to know whose arm Penny        was clinging to.And Penny, his gorgeous  copper haired Penny, had had her face toward      a street light and had photographed  beautifully.Isaacs shot a black and Eli look at the young man."No point tearing them up, the wimp said."I have them on a disc.They could go  out over the internet and reach everyone whoever heard of you and a lot you didnt.They  call it spam," he added, "and it doesnt come in a can.But youre too  old to know that!"Isaacs owned several minor telecom corpora tions and a solid share of two of the  majors, but he ignored the slur.Penny would be upset if her picture went out like this.Penny was a girl to appreciate the good things in life and Isaacs knew what they were and  had what it took to pay for them.He wasnt worried about Bruce Lucent.Lucent was a has been before he ever  became anything once he plowed his fancy,   rented by the month car into a telephone  pool.They said the cast went right up to his groin.That guy wasnt going to be making  any ladies happy.No, it was Penny Isaacs thought of.A pictur e of his hand up her skirt and on her  bare bottom all over the world would s    our things with Penny for good.The pools  aquamarine tiled depths beckoned to him.Isaacs locked both hands on the masseuses  forearm and pulled him and his pictures backward into the  Chorine scented depths.That takes care of the pictures, he thought,  as he shoved at the  youths face, struggling to hold him under w ith his greater strength and body weight.He  was counting seconds.It would not do to actually harm the blackmailer.Scare him would  be useful.Ten seconds, he thought and released his grip and swam from the side."Help!"he  yelled.He coughed and gasped as if it had been he who had swallowed water."Call the cops!"It was the surprise that had taken him o ff balance.A few words in the right ears  and this wet nosed EST would be glad to leave town.Atlanta was too small for the pair of  them and Isaacs knew which one was going to   have to go.He fitted into the puzzle of  local politics, law, charities, and religions  perfectly.Whats his name was a nobody and  he would stay that way.Already the clubs staffs were running to help him over the edge of the pool.He stood, water running everywhere and   said, "That man grabbed my arm and  sent me off balance into the pool. "Hed  won already, Isaacs knew.They were fishing  the other guy out of the other side of the pool to keep the two of them apart.The manager, incongruous in high heels on  the pool level was already at his side,  red lacquered lips gleaming in the overhead  lighting, pouring out apologies.Her raccoon  eyes rolled with sympathy as she purred and fussed."Just get you a robe and send that  suit to the cleaners"         "I have a spare suit in my cubical," he  said."If I could join you in your office, I  think we need to speak about the behavior of your staff. ""Of course," said the manager."You poor dear!I cant imagine. "Her voice faded  as Isaacs made his exit, gratified that some one was going to have to go van the floor and  carpet all the way up to the forth floor where his cubical was, on the exclusive Platinum  Peach Executive Cabana Level.He had already see the soggy shreds of his paper and the pictures fluttering like rotting leaves in the  bottom of the pool and the pool cleaner maneuvering his equipment into place to clear the  water.The ladies of the club were due to have  their private hour in a few minutes, and  some of them would even enter the water       before they showered, did their hair and  makeup, and had a liquid and gossipy lunch in the Georgia Girl Grill.Isaacs had never set a foot in the place: The avenged age of the of girls was forty   five and the real babes were at work or working out at this time of the day.Isaacs took his time lathering the hair  all over his body, rinsing twice once hot  and once cold.It would do the manager good to sit in her office and worry about what  had happened.Whatever the kids name was,  his job was history, and a few words to the  police    Better do it now, thought Isaacs, and grimaced  when he discovered, his cell phone had gone into the pool with him.That was one thing he hadnt thought to keep a spare of, here.His Blackberry was  ruined, too, but he kept that back up."Shit," he said elegantly.He smiled at himself in the  mirror, revealing a lot of white, carefully   capped teeth.Just one more thing he could  complain to the manager about.One more touch of reality.Although her desk was intended to look imposing, Lucille McHency looked  cornered behind it when Isaacs walked in.She stood."I am so sorry," she said."He  grabbed your arm, you said?You didnt really want the Police. ""Wanted my attention about something," said Isaacs."I cant stop to talk with  everyone and he wouldnt take a hint.My suits ruined, my cellophane, my Blackberry. ""Well, the cub will pay for everything," said Lucille."I dont know what to say about  Stevie. ""Is that his name," rasped Isaacs?"Yes, Steve Suffern.Hes popular with many of the clients. "She toyed with a  letter opener."You say he touched you.Im sure he meant well. ""Im not a man to make a fuss," said  Issacs, knowing that meant they both knew  that as a member of the board he was a ma n who could and did, "but if Id hit my head  when he sent me for a tumble"         "Oh, God," wailed Ms.McHency."I mean.We have to think of the club.A lawsuit could break us.I just lost a few  things and some time.Does he have a contract?""Yes.Yes.We have all our employees sign contracts Mr.Isaacs.Who know that. "She went to the file cabinets along the  wall, unlocked one, and hunted within.Isaacs  admired her rear in its tight skirt.Like a  peach packed into stretch Lycra.She had been  good looking in her time and kept herself up but         "Here it is," gabbled Lucille."Let me look that ore," growled Isaacs.She handed it to him along with a fetching   glimpse of the top half of her black  lace bra in the low neckline of her blouse.Be hind her, on the industrial gray wall, filled  the wall with hints of a world beyond Atlanta."I think we can just ask me. "he paused."Suffern," supplied Lucille."His name is Suffern.Hes popular"         "I think the board can just ask him to leave.We cant risk a lawsuit.Something goes wrong after an incident like this, the board and management  could be seen as negligent. ""Oh, yes, I see," said Lucille."See its one the agenda for Friday,"     said Isaacs."I have to get about my  business. "He needed to speak to a contact   or two in the police to make sure anything  Suffern had at his place was removed before the boy got sacked.It would pick today to rain, thought Venice, looking out the window into the early  morning rain.Everybody talks about the   weather, but nobody does anything about it.Who said that?Somebody famous ...Abraha m Lincoln?Or maybe Benjamin Franklin?Andrew Venice impatiently pushed the question out of his mind.He was the kind of man  who did things, not thought about them.And today was the day ...well, he had his  plans.The rain was coming down in steady bucketfuls.Not the gentle kind of summer  rain that "maketh the little flowers to grow," but a drenching, cold Georgia rain that  nobody in his right mind would go out in if they  had any sense or, for that matter, choice  in the matter.The rain didn't look like it  was going to stop anytime soon, either.Andrew  Venice shrugged his manly shoulders.He had his plans, and he wasn't going to let a little bad whether stop him from doing what a ma n had made up his mind to do.And Arthur  Venice was every single inch a man    he had no doubt at all about that.Neither did  anyone who'd had anything to do with him, especially the scum who ran afoul of him in  the course of his police work.Some people might think that at the age of 40, he might be  getting on in years.But nobody who had anything to do with Andrew Venice was going  to have any question about his manliness.That's what I like about Margaret, he told himself.She knows a good thing when  she sees it, and knows enough to grab on to it and not let go.With a body like that, a man  could get used to being grabbed on to.Heh heh, he chuckled to himself.Heh heh.He turned away from the window.Time   was a wasting.He was a man with a  plan, and he knew just what he wanted.Time to go ahead and just do it.* * *         Margaret studied her pretty face in the circular magnifying mirror above her  makeup table.She hadn't slept well last night, and    to her practiced eye, at least    it  showed.Just her luck to be called on for an   extra shift in the ER, on a night when the  heavy rain had caused twice the usual number of accidents.She'd had to cancel her plans for the even ing, a night at the movies with Jocelyn.They'd planned on seeing the latest Eddie  Murphy comedy at the Grand    that Murphy  always made her laugh uproariously, which was the best remedy for a set of nerves  frayed by the sight of too much blood and  too many hopelessly fractured bodies.Instead,  she'd had a full dose of exactly what she'd wanted to escape.The movie would have been fun    but deep down inside, she knew that it wasn't  what she really wanted, either.She looked deep, deep into her own peerless eyes, and an enigmatic smile blossomed upon her ruby jaws.She'd almost turned Jocelyn down,  hoping for a call from him    she had a hunch,   all right.Any nurse worth her salt knew  when to trust hunches like that.After all, she was a woman first and a nurse second.The  smile broadened and went to her eyes, crinkling her nose as it went past, like a parked car  sideswiped by a passing delivery truck.Well, Maggie baby, there'll be plenty of   time for more movies    and plenty of  time for the other, too!she told her smiling reflection, silently.Plenty of time...The doorbell buzzed, startling her, seemingly  as loudly as if a rousing basketball  game had just come to its dramatic final conclusion.Margaret Eastman stood, almost unconsciously glancing down at her voluptuous  body clad only in a flimsy peignoir.Could it be?...Could it...?YES!Her woman's  intuition told her.Yes!Yes!She rushed to the door, undulating provocatively as she strode impetuously across  the deeply carpeted floor.Heedless of consequences, she flung the door open    and there  he stood, a tempting vision of manhood even in  a dripping Burberry.A checked slouch  hat protected his hair, as she might have noticed if she had had sufficient time for such a  minute observation.Behind him, the pelting Georgia rain poured down, cruel and  relentless as the sands of time."Come in   at once!"she cried."You must not be seen  here!"Out on the sidewalk behind him, the pedestrians of Atlanta strolled by idly, little  noting, nor likely long to remember, the tempestuous passions coming to a rolling boil  only a few feet away form their languid gazes."I care not a rap who sees us!"growled Andrew Venice    for it was, as any astute  reader must by now have guessed, none other  than he who had so impetuously rung her  bell."I am here to carry you away with me!""Quickly!Inside!"she repeated, grasping his lapels and impelling him through  the door.She pushed it shut behind her and turned to fix him with her sultry gaze, leaning  voluptuously back against the paneled door she had just that moment closed."I cannot  believe that you are here at last!"she hissed."I had thought... ""Believe it, baby," muttered Venice, tossing aside his hat.The raincoats followed,  then his jacket and tie, his belt, his undershirt...They fell to the deeply carpeted floor, pawing one another like impassioned  mammals."Oh!"she moaned."Andrew!I never thought... ""Don't think, baby," he said, with a nuance at once manly and indescribably  tender.His hands moved surely.For a while  they said nothing.Then soft murmurs broke  from Margaret's lips.They built inevitably, under his expertly ad   ministered caresses, to a crescendo of  moans...And then the sky exploded around them both.* * *         Afterwards, Andrew Venice lit a matched pair of cigarettes and gave one to his  exhausted but still visibly an eager lover."I have come," he said softly, "to take you away  with me.Margaret, you hot little nurse.I  can hardly wait to make you all my own!Where do you want to go to get married?"Trembling with delight, she thought a moment, then sighed, "Memphis, of course.I want to be married by Elvis. ""Elvis?"Venice pouted."Won't that be easier in Vegas?I know a couple of  chapels there.They've got the pink Cadillac and everything... "She shook her head, her short hair falling   for a moment in front of her peerless  eyes.
