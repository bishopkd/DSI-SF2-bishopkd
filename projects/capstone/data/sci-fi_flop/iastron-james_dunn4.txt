The sound of cries and screams, which had died away once they had been thrown inside, was suddenly so much louder.And closer.Annas heart pounded.The violent snap and boom of the electric weapons of the Guard filled the alleyway outside.Were here!Glana cried.Help  The nearby sentry drove his blade into the ground beside them.Gordian!An unmasked Crilshan entered the badly lit room.He looked down at the three captives, stroking a disfigured face and cautiously listening to the commotion outside.Heed the warning, Gordian said, not in Crilshan, but the Common Tongue.Prepare to leave.Were going.Iturat!Another gestured to Anna, Jon, and Glana.Artak fiyl ayana!Yes.Gordian nodded.Bring them too.He motioned to some others, who, until now, had remained concealed in the dark.He led them to the back door where they pulled out firearms and moved to join the battle outside.The door slammed shut behind them, followed by an ear splitting burst of air from the alley.A rumbling shook the room, and hot metal, stone, and dust fell through the roof.Something collided with Anna.She pulled her sister close, shielding her with her body.The ceiling collapsed inward, crushing the cloaked man before them.As Glana held onto her tighter than ever, Jon leaned over to Anna, panting.This is whats coming to Titan, he said.You have to realise, leaving is our only chance.We have to get out.Now.Anna shook her head.I cant take Glana out there.You cant leave her here!Titan is no longer safe.He clutched her hand, she took hold of Glana, and the three scrambled from the room and into the next.From there a crumbling stairway led them out and they charged across the rubble.The military hovercraft she had witnessed from her terrace now circled above, darting and avoiding return strikes from the dark, cloaked men.Overmatched, they nevertheless continued to fight back against the Titanese Guard that had discovered them.The three stopped at the edge of the roof and looked out.The dock was straight ahead.They could make it if they ran.Jon took hold of Anna and looked into her eyes.We have to go, he begged.Well save your sister too.Jon, I  Think!he said.What would your uncle want?I know hed want you both safe!Well thats what Im going to do!COME ON!And they took off for the dock, hoping that the shuttlecraft would still take off in the crisis surrounding them.Anna dragged her terrified sister behind as three masked Crilshans took chase.She prayed she was making the right decision.* * *  Callista!Ruben Berenguer tore through the dusty hallway leading to the Istrons home.Callista, are you there?No reply.Confident the Guard would take care of his nieces, his thoughts had turned to Callista.If he was right and the assassins were attacking the Surrogate Sun, there was nothing more he could do.Had Gordian been telling the truth, had he injected her with the same poison as Lady Pinzn, then he had to find her.He had to make sure she was all right.The old Istron had nobody else.Callista?Lucasta?!He heaved his way through her door, and let out a cry of anguish.Lay sprawled across the floor on her front, Callista wasnt moving.He charged forward, raised her frail body, and turned to leave.But he stopped suddenly and fell to his knees.A small metal device, planted on the table before him, counted down, reaching its end.And with it their end:  5 ...Callista!he sobbed.Wake up, I need you!4 ...This was it.3 ...No.2 ...Suddenly and miraculously, as though in her deathlike state she could still hear the cries of her little Ruben, Callista bolted from his arms and stretched out both of hers at the device.1 ...His ears split inside with the drumming carrying through his head.A loud and painful pop and suddenly he could hear nothing.Callista held out both hands and they shook wildly.He could tell she was in agony.But she held on.A blue and violet light erupted from the device, and a great heat, but it stopped before it reached them.Contained in a colossal sphere which filled the room, Callista held the explosion at bay.Her expression exposed the piercing torment within as the light reached its climax and then folded inward.She collapsed at his side and the room plunged into darkness.* * *  Anna raced across the metal platform leading up to the docked shuttlecraft, Glanas hand held tightly in hers.Jon followed close behind.The cloaked men had taken chase and were right on their tail.Faster!she heard Jon call.We are!I MEAN IT!The shuttlecraft would be leaving at any moment, but they could still make it.There was time!They reached a huge metal blast door, but there was no way they could get through.Follow me!Jon shouted as he caught up.He stepped off the platform and onto a small ledge, less than a foot wide, attached to the side of the craft.He picked up a hidden tool bag from a secure gap he had left it, strapped it around his middle, and reached out to pull them across.Are you crazy?Glana screamed.Its either this or them!he said, pointing to three wraiths now running down the platform towards them, blades in hand.Gordian was coming.A torrent of bullets flew at the three, and the sisters dropped to the ground, sparks raining all around them.Okay fine, Im coming!Glana jumped up and bounded across.Anna helped her onto the ledge, following closely herself.They shifted along precariously until they reached another platform, slightly higher.She turned.Already the masked Crilshans were on the ledge in pursuit.Jon clambered up and the girls followed.He put down the large backpack and removed a sizeable drill, quickly and precisely detaching the corners of a tapered grate.Finishing, he pushed the drill over the ledge; it fell far and, to their delight, took one of their attackers with it.In!he said, pulling out a torch, and again they followed him into a narrow tunnel, crawling on their hands and knees as fast as they could.How do you know where were going?Anna said.I told you, he replied, Ive planned this all out.Before Anna could reply a deafening sound filled their ears and the tunnel surrounding them trembled.Oh, no, she whimpered.Her stomach lurched and she pulled herself along faster.Okay, dont worry!Dont panic!shouted Jon over the roar that seemed to be growing in intensity.Just keep moving!They came eventually to the end of the tunnel.Jon stopped.No.Whats wrong?Anna asked.No!Jon screamed.NO, NO, NO!Whats wrong?What is it?The vent, he said.Its locked on this end too!Anna gasped in horror.Were trapped?Its not meant to be!I checked the plans!No!It shouldntit cant be!Please, no!Glana shrieked.This is all your fault.Look what youve done!Move back!he barked as the tunnel around them shook so hard they quickly began to fall back down the passage.Anna held onto her sister and the passage walls, but as she did she lost her grip and Glana slammed into the interior wall of the passageway.She smashed her head and at once went limp.Anna pulled her away from Jon and he took a deep breath, examining the vent lock.He then switched positions and faced Anna.As their eyes met, terrified, he said, Im so sorry, and he began kicking the vent now behind him.Anna didnt know what to do.She clung to Glana as they were thrown around the tunnel.It was so dark, so awful.It would be the last thing she would see before she died.Come on!Come on!he screamed as he kicked, harder and harder.Then the deafening noise ended; the shaking ceased and the light went out.Pulled by some invisible energy Anna was forced forward, and as she felt a sharp pain tear through her forehead, the cold hand of death stroked by, and she fell from consciousness.Twenty Nine      Pale blue light guided Antal Justus down the claustrophobic hallway of Erebus Station.So as not to pass by his destination without realising, he dimmed his eyes and slowly examined each metal door on the corridor; he didnt much fancy having to backtrack again and recruit a passer by to guide him.It didnt look good and he felt rather foolish doing so.Eventually he found what he wanted, and read out loud the writing on the door before him.Section Three.Dorm Seventeen.Inside was the man hed been sent to see: First Project Officer Araman Alwar.Justus had been part of the Erebus Project for almost two weeks and was still becoming accustomed to the cold and quiet atmosphere which followed him as dauntingly as the thunderstorm hed left behind in the desert of Rotavar.His nightmares had finally ceased; he hadnt suffered a single one since his approach to the station.It did not, however, stop him mulling over in his mind the girl hed seen or the strange sensation he felt in his stomach whenever he thought of her.He was beginning to like his life on Erebus.Though he wasnt getting paid he was nonetheless a well respected captain of seventy loyal soldiers; he no longer had to worry about where his next meal was coming from; and he was definitely enjoying sharing his bed with one of the most beautiful women hed laid eyes upon.He didnt even have to worry about what was happening on the station in terms of research or funding; his job was security and even that had become merely routine.He could definitely get used to it.Justus held his hand up to the door, not quite knowing what to expect of the person waiting inside.Aramans harmless, Ketrass had told him earlier that day.And something of a genius too.It doesnt stop him acting like a freak though.Odd would be an understatement.My advice would be get in and get out!Most of what he says doesnt even make sense.Kramer says his idiocys catching.Thats why he keeps him out of the way down there.Justus held his breath and knocked twice.He would have done so a third time had the metal door not swung back before his knuckles found it again.Heavens!cried the occupant, whose curious face stared suddenly back.Good heavens!Antal Justus?Yeah, thats  Come in, come in!He took Justus by the collar and almost dragged him into the small, cluttered room.This is your workshop?Justus asked, brushing down his dark uniform and staring about.It is indeed.You like it?Yeah, its  Thought you would!They say youre from Earth.That true?Well, yeah, I  Brilliant.What you think of this?The enthusiastic young man pulled out an old, dust ridden contraption which half resembled a visual comm link device.Ever seen one of these back there?No  Im not too sure what it does.I mean, what it did.So youre  Yes, of coursehow rude of me!He brushed his palms on his sides and took hold of Justus hand with both of his, shaking it wildly.Araman, he said.Araman Alwar.And you  Okay, Justus stopped him short.I dont know where youre from or what youre taking, but I swear Im going to have to thump you if you dont take a breath.Oh, of ...of course, Araman mumbled, flushing pink.The oddball was shorter than the captain, with tidy blond hair and ruby coloured cheeks which left Justus picturing the old fashioned dolls which were gathered in the house he grew up in.Araman Alwar coughed in an attempt to gain his attention, which had drifted off among the heaps of objects littering the small but extremely tall room.Im sorry, he squeaked.I dont get out of here too often ...ha!...if you couldnt tell.The old captain used to come and talk to me all the time, but hes gone nowobviously!He pointed at Justus uniform.Avne hardly comes down anymore.Kramer and Lesper only summon me when I can be of use.I guess its just nice to see a new face.I can relate, Justus said, trying to appear understanding.How long have you been here?Since the beginning.Got plucked right out of the university on Mar Andra by Commander Lesper.Never left.Never left?How are you not insane?What part of our introduction left you with the impression I was sane?Justus laughed.Ten years is a long time to spend down here.Worth it, I hope.What exactly are you anyway, fourteen?Actually, Im almost thirty!Youre older than me?How the hell is that possible?They both laughed.Doctor Ketrass said youre some kind of genius.Did she?He sounded grateful.Well ...I guess so.His face fell and he sat down.Im guessing somebody sent you here for something, he said.I cant imagine another reason to expect company.Justus bit his lip.He pitied the young chap, left on his own, unappreciated and ignored.He considered inviting him for a walk or a drink, but his mind wandered rapidly when his eyes caught the glistening flicker of an item, mounted on the wall a little way up.Is that a ...wow!It cant be!Is what a ...oh, yes, Araman replied, realising what hed seen as though he too was often distracted by the item.He pushed over a stool and climbed on top of an unsteady looking pile of discoloured manuscripts.There he lifted the sheathed blade of an historic rapier from the stand above.Youre an enthusiast?he asked as he offered it over.You could say that, Justus said, taking the blade from Araman and gently raising the hilt to his eye line, before taking it out, grasping it firmly, and striking the pose hed been taught to adopt from an early age.Traditional rapier, he said.Thirty six inch blade.Wire wrapped.Weight ...oh, two pounds ...four ounces?Five.Of course.Impressive, Araman said.You play?Justus smiled as he recalled his early years living in the manor on Earth.Countless memories flashed up and he drove the latter few from his mind.A fair bit, he said, sheathing the rapier and handing it back.Lesper mentioned you have something ready for me.He said something about a prototype.Ah, yes.Funny we should begin by sharing a mutual passionabove all this one.Hang on a moment.He hurried off before returning, as luck would have it, with a long, coiled blade, about the length of his forearm.Justus took it and admired the golden laid metalwork.The young man certainly was talented.Why do I get the feeling this isnt your standard coilbolt?Araman laughed.No fooling you, I see.Youd think it was standard by first glance.Ignite it.Justus obeyed.He flicked the switch and found to his surprise that the steady hum of the metal was joined, not by the traditional blue and purple glow, but by a dazzling dance of intense ruby red sparks.I call it the advanced coilbolt, Araman said.I dont like the word prototype.This ones just as good as the others.Others?Lespers having me make many more.Yours is the very first.I dont understand, he said.These are only used on Titan.Whats the need for them here?I have theories.But I figure: the only way to find out is to do what Im asked.Its taken years but Ive managed to combine the technologies of both Titan and Crilshar, and this is the finished product: a coil that can project electrical bursts of power and yet ensnare enemy attacks and return them as rapidly as Crilshan blades can.Justus gestured with the red glowing weapon like a child fooling around with his fathers heavy blade.Well, Im impressed.And the fact its red?Araman smiled.A secret Ill keep to myself if thats okay with you.For the time being, at least.Have it your way, Justus said, extinguishing the coil.It may have been the contagiously optimistic mood surrounding Araman Alwar, but all of a sudden the Captain felt that much more cheerful.It felt good, like he used to feel with his crew.He thought of Adra Dimal and felt warm again.So far from civilization, and deep within a suffocating mountain of indeterminate substance, he simply hoped it would last.Thirty      Adra Dimal woke with alarm, her blaster gripped tightly in her hand.For a moment she wondered where she was, but the disappointment quickly caught up.She sat back in her chair in the cockpit of the Crimson Flux.Outside the wind howled against the window, while the Accentaurian sun joined that of Accentaurib on the horizon.Kondogopas appeared in the distance, a shining blotch on a deadly yellow dune.Oh, Justus, she muttered.Where are you?She checked the time on the dash, realised shed only been snoozing for half an hour.She sighed deeply and bent down to fix her boots, before standing and putting on her coat.Shed made up her mind.Enough debating.Time was running out.Rotavar was besieged, though the emerald soldiers of the Defence had fought every day.Silence as Dimal collapsed back into her seat.It was hopeless.They were trapped.Almost three weeks since Justus abandoned them.She was exhausted.A knock on the cockpit hatch.Noah Nuveen shuffled in, followed by Raj and Shree Timbur, and finally a timid Aron Veryan.All were yawning and rubbing their eyes, blood shot and irritable.You called?Raj said.Yeah, she said.We need to talk.Im just going to go ahead and say it.Were in the shit.Noah started to choke, and Raj thumped him on the back.I mean it, she said.Were a couple of days away from running out of food.One of us needs to do something.What we need, Noah coughed, is to get away from here.I know.I know.Ive made up my mind.Im going to head into the city.See what I can find out.Colony scans look like theyre gathering soldiers from all the northern cities.Ill go with you, Raj said.No, Raj.Youre the only other crewmember able to pilot the Flux with any sorta knack.Youll stay.Then take Shree?I dont think so.Im trying to stay unnoticed.No offence, Shree.Shree shrugged her huge shoulders.Its better if I go alone.You can contact me anytime via comm.Dont use any names.Call me Desert Fox.Why do we need code names?Noah asked cynically.Because its exciting!Raj answered.Then why Desert Fox?The old holo film?Dimal said.Not remember?No idea, Dim.Really?Noah coughed.Youre right, she said.Bigger picture.She looked to Aron.Well be alright.As captain Ill do everything I can.Share my rations between you.Ill pinch what I need out there.Be careful, Raj said.Keep in contact, Noah advised.Shree nodded and Aron smiled weakly.Lets hope I find something.Dimal breathed out.If not, well be stuck here with these blasted Crilshans until we starve.Or worse, they find us.Thirty One      Anna Berenguer forced her eyes open.Her head throbbed painfully.Her stomach was executing summersaults.She gagged at the thought that it was only because she was so hungry.Stretching, she attempted to remember where she was.It was only as she sat up, however, that she realised she was not actually sitting at all.A slack black belt hugged her belly, holding her down against the metal floor.Her legs floated in the air before her, while her armswait, noher whole body hovered as though she were in  Space!What?came a voice.Were in space!she cried aloud.Wayta catch up, Annie.Jon?she said.Glana?Across the low ceilinged opening she saw them, also floating in the middle of the room.They straightened themselves up and pushed off from the wall, gliding effortlessly towards her.What happened?Where are we?You dont remember?Jon asked.I remember running.I remember crawling through a tunnel.I remember holding Glana ...and I ...I hit my head.You did, he said.Really hard, Glana added, patting her own.Even harder than me!But we made it?We definitely made it?Barely, Jon said.The gate gave way just in time.Next stop Mars then, she said with a laugh.* * *  It had been such a relief to discover they had made it onboard the vessel.Jon and Glana had dragged Annas unconscious body through from the shuttlecraft and into the great vessels empty dock.From there they had lugged her down into the desolate depths of the ship, isolated and unseen.Managing to survive the launch of the shuttlecraft on Titan was one thing, but the three were quickly faced with a considerably more dismal problem.As far as Anna was concerned, running out of food so fast would be the most embarrassing way to meet her demise.But their food and water had indeed almost run out, mainly due to the unexpected addition of Glana and the fact that only one small bag had made it onto the trip with them.Their situation was desperate.Hunger was a more stubborn companion than Glana had become.The youngest Berenguer groaned beside her big sister and Jon told her to stop whining.But even he had his gripes.Of blatant importance was the fact that they had no gravity.Anna explained to the others that artificial gravity was an extremely hard state to maintain; she recalled from her studies that there were sensors planted throughout the vessels which identified when a member of the crew was in a certain section, area, or room.And if there isnt, she said, then the room shuts down and power is rerouted.But there is someone in here, Jon reminded her for the sixtieth time.Yes, Anna said.But not a member of the crew.Perhaps they havent realised anyones down here.And by perhaps she meant hopefully.They had done well to strap themselves down whenever they rested or slept.Anna had her belt, Glana a disconnected power cable, and Jon a torn off section of his shirt.So far they had been just fine, though Glana had been sick a couple of times.Will we have enough oxygen?Jon asked again.Dont worry, she told him.Its much easier to keep oxygen running throughout the whole vessel than to control and cut it off.But wont we ...Wont what?You know, he said, anxiously.Go dizzy, or fall unconscious or ...or anything like that?Not if we keep ourselves active.Im sure thats what we were told at the Institute.We need to spend time keeping our muscles and bones in use.Otherwise well just float about, useless.If there was anything Anna felt, however, it was useless.Over the next twenty four hours, though without a way to tell they could not be sure of the day or time, they became more and more disorientated.Despite taking plenty rest, the three felt increasingly drainedor, as Glana termed it, flimsy.While not as bad as Glana, and despite doing what exercise they could make themselves do, Anna and Jon soon began to feel the effects of zero gravity.Nausea, insomnia, and frequent headaches quickly kicked in, and after what felt like several days, though it could have been a little less or indeed many more, they had all become so restless that Anna considered leaving their hideaway to see what news she could find.Jon put a stop to that idea right away.On top of all of that, she could not stop herself from worrying about her uncle.They were on their way to freedom, leaving behind the war and strife; she only wished that she had left a message behind.Who knew how her uncle had reacted, or even if he had survived the attack at all?On the fifth night since their departure from Titan, Anna forced herself once again to ignore her regrets and worries, and she attached her belt around her middle, closed her eyes, and slept.* * *  I dont know what to say.Anna put her arm around her sister.The log Jon hacked into said wed be making for an outpost overlooking the Martian Colony on Mars.I had hoped we could skip onto a vessel heading for Earth from there.And how long should it take us to reach this outpost?Glana asked, more weary than she had been thus far.The following day was just like the last: they sat and spoke, ate a little, exercised, and then slept again.Only a couple of days.I wish we knew how many its been, she said.We should be there by now.Jons messed up again!I am here, Jon said, drifting above them with his legs straightened out and his hands behind his head.Lucky us, Glana mumbled.But you know what I mean.What if were not even heading for Mars?You think weve not considered that?Anna said.Glana leaned away.Its just too bad he couldnt have figured out this was a bad idea before he brought you and me along!Again, still here.He floated to the other side of the rectangular room, as though travelling lengths in an elongated swimming bath.Anna bit her lip and leaned in close to her little sister.She would have had to tell her the truth eventually.Glana, I ...I was going to go with him anyway.You were what?!How could you?Leave me and uncle Ruben alone ...leave me on my own?Youre meant to be my big sister!Anna did not reply.She was right.There was nothing she could say; not even sorry would cut it.She glanced up, expecting Jon to move over and join in.But he wasnt there.Jon?She unfastened her belt, rising from the ground as she did so, tightened it up, and placed it back around her waist.Together the two sisters drifted across the room toward the place Jon had disappeared.Jon?Jon, stop fooling around.I dont feel very well, Glana said.Go back then, sis.And be on my own?I dont think so.At the end of the room there hung down great pipes, dark and oppressive, and the girls held onto them, pulling themselves along.Pitch black tunnels led through into many more.A thought occurred to Anna at that point.You know what?she said.What?Weve been talking about how weve not reached the Martian Colony.But down here, so deep, how would we even know if we had?Glana went to reply.But Anna was right.Maybe they were already there.Maybe they had arrived and left again, and the stowaways had been none the wiser  ARGHHH!burst a cry from around the corner.The girls would have jumped, had they been able.Instead Anna kicked out with both feet, booting Jon hard in the jaw.Wow!Its only me, he said, massaging his chin and laughing.I know it is!You fool!Glana said.Thats not funny!Of course it is, he said, and he took Annas arm.You wont believe what Ive found!Jon led them along the darkened tunnel, through the hidden bowels of the interstellar vessel.Everything was silent, like the ship had been abandoned.All life was above them.No one ventured down amid the dark.Eventually Jon stopped.A small door with an even smaller window presented another compartment.When he forced the unbolted door open all three landed on their feet, then fell at once to their knees, unable to stand.Cool air swept past their faces and Anna sighed with relief.The new compartment allowed for a limited view out into the depths of space; the reinforced windows, several metres thick, meant the three would at least see the pale light of the sun through the endless blanket of stars.It was all so beautiful.Anna crawled across the floor and caught her breath before she could speak.It was ...unbelievable.She had made it.She pictured her fellow students, back at the Institute, studying so that they could travel out among the stars.But she was already there.Jon, however, did not seem so ecstatic.In fact, if anything, he looked panicked.And very quickly it dawned on her just why.It was Glana who said it first.The sun is so far away, she said softly.Shes right, Jon said.He shot her an alarming look.Were so far away.I think weve made a mistake.We have to give ourselves up, Glana said.No chance!Do you have any idea whatd happen if we were caught?You two are the great generals nieces!Youll get off lightly.Its me thatd get it full throttle!I dont care!You both wanted to run away from everything.I didnt want to be here!Jon punched the hulls metal interior.I saved your life!You deserve whatever comes to you, Glana shouted, falling to the floor, sobbing.I didnt ask for this!Without warning she doubled up on her knees, coughing and spluttering, and vomit poured across the grated floor.With some effort Anna picked herself up and walked to the other side of the compartment, and resting against the wall held her head in her hands.Jon simply looked out of the window, deadened.Just like the other two: now fearful, not only for their futures, but their very lives.Thirty Two      Yes, yes, yes!Araman Alwar cried as he hastened along the narrow corridors of Erebus Station.He dodged two passing science officers and yelled his apology without stopping, the message from Commander Lesper still ringing in his ears.He reached Justus door and forced the door open.Knock, knock!His face flushed deeply as he stood in the opening.Antal Justus cursed and Avne Ketrass, lay undressed in the bed beside him, threw a pillow in his direction.Araman ducked the flying sack of feathers and spun, slamming the door behind him.Well thats interesting, he said with a smile as the two emerged from the room several minutes later.Justus caught his eye and grinned.Oh, of course, Ketrass replied, tying her hair into a bun at the back.Not at all embarrassing!Perhaps youll try the knock and wait method next time.Trust me, therell be no next time, he said.Ill stay down in my workshop and go down to Section Six myself when Lesper calls again.Ketrass attention left her hair and fixed upon Araman.Nows not the time to joke, she said.Im not joking.I received a message from Commander Lesper and came straight here.He wants us to meet him.Who?All three of us.Okay.Where?Araman took a deep breath and steadied himself.Just as I said: Section Six.* * *  Five years!shouted Ketrass.Five bloody years!Err, ten here, Araman said.I dont care, she said, leading the way down a series of ladder wells descending into the depths of the station.Its about time I got to see whats down here.Ive worked hard enough!Yes, and youre not the only one, Avne.Fair enough.Weve worked hard enough.I still dont understand, though.Why now?He looked back at Justus.That decides it: either theyve found something or theyre shutting down the operation entirely!They wouldnt do that, Justus said.Would they?Araman observed the disappointment in his eyes.It had been only three days since their first meeting, but he liked the new company.Sure, Antal Justus was no match for the old captain, but he was happy with the replacement all the same.Justus had visited him twice in the last three days.At first they had spoken only of Erebus, but later he had enlightened the new captain on how to approach Professor Xerin Kramer when he would eventually meet him.Cut off from the Systems for so long, Araman had been keen to hear news of the escalating conflict with the Dishan Alliance and the Alignment.According to Justus darkness and war had continued to creep back into the Systems in the last decade, and because no one on the station was allowed news of the outside world through any means other than Commander Lesper or Professor Kramer, word of what had been happening between the Dishan and those in opposition to its regime had gone unheard for a long time.Araman had felt very much in the dark for so long now, and if not for the frequent visits from the old captain, and now Justus, he thought he might have gone mad.Five bloody years, Ketrass muttered, in the lead as they passed through sets of darkened doors, entering various vaults secured inside and out by the sternest looking guards Araman had laid eyes upon.Currently they all bore typical Titanese coilbolts, which he assumed were now standard among the Alignment, but very soon they would each possess the same coiled weapons as the one he had presented the Captain with.As the three approached, he watched their hands move to the hilts of the coils; old, gloved, undaunted hands.The elite station soldiers were down around Section Six, but for what reason he could only hope he was about to find out.They continued lower, the light ebbing away, replaced by the growing feeling of despair.It was very much as it had been when he had first witnessed the brink of the Black Labyrinth; by his reckoning they couldnt have been too far from the same depth on this side of the station.They reached the end of the lowest tunnel and Araman turned sharply.He stared at the two before him, and concentrated on Justus.One moment, he said.Have you told him, Avne?Told me what?Justus asked.Oh, she said.I thought you would.Tell me what?Araman cleared his throat.Why would I?We should do it now, dont you think?Tell me wha  Shhh!they said together.Just do it, she said.Oh, fine.Araman looked to Justus.You see, Antal.Professor Kramer.He isnt exactly what youd call ...correct.Correct?Ketrass said, laughing.Shhh!Yes, corrects the word I meant.You see, Antal, this place.It does things to you.Xerin Kramer wasnt exactly normal anyway, by todays standards at least, but hes  What are you doing out here?The heavy, reinforced hatch groaned open behind them and Lesper stood in the doorway.We were Ketrass began.Never mind!Come on, get inside here.Come on!The three locked eyes in anticipation and followed the Commander within.What waited inside, however, none would have guessed.Deep below the surface of the station and the black asteroid, and submerged in the cold air which ebbed away at a mans dark thoughts, Section Six was one enormous, solitary room.Large and lacking any proper light, the obscure darkness seemed intensified ten fold.Lesper walked around a blinking metal panel and stopped beside another man, stood with his back to them, a long, dark lab coat draped over his shoulders.The man turned slowly and without a word.Ketrass, who worked closely with Xerin Kramer on occasion, stayed where she was.Araman, however, led Justus forward.Professor Kramer eyed Justus as they approached.Araman had meant to warn him not to stare at Kramers facial covering: a metal half mask he loathed anybody looking at.Covering almost half of the professors face was a rigid plate of black metal, fashioned with sinister carvings and fastened to his head by steel screws drilled into the left portion of his jaw, cheek, and forehead.But Justus did not seem at all disturbed.In fact he seemed grimmer than he had thus far.Upon seeing the three visitors Kramers mouth hung open, revealing a lower set of uneven teeth, surrounded by a neatly trimmed beard of white and black hair, and a pale face which rivalled Justus himself.Araman had always looked up to Kramer in a strange way; he was candid, and while maybe not always diplomatic it was clear he cared about what they were doing here.Professor, Araman said, this is Captain Antal Jus  Yes I am well aware of who he is, thank you, Alwar, Kramer snapped, and he looked intensely at Justus, searching out any worth in the man.To Aramans surprise Justus did the same, not speaking a word, simply staring.Ive heard a great deal about you, Antal, Kramer said at last, and Araman watched his gaze flicker, just for a second, towards Ketrass.Im honoured by your attention, Justus replied.I can see myself in you, Captain, he said.You are, unlike others, not self interested.Youre shrouded in doubt, in allure.He glanced in Aramans direction.That is of course the principal reason for mine and the Commanders choice to invite you here.You are, let us say, indispensable yet unmissed.Oh, Im pretty sure Im missed, Justus retorted, parrying the professors underhand jab.A smirk issued from the visible corner of Kramers mouth.Perhaps.But not by anyone who matters.Did you invite us down here for a chat, Professor, or is there something you want us to see?Kramer ignored him and turned to Araman and Ketrass.We called you down here because the wheel of providence has been set in motion.Something has happened which cannot be ignored, nor held secret.There is no turning back from what we are about to show you.The three visitors remained silent.You have to be sure, Lesper said.Each of you must be certain you wish to know this revelation.If you arent then leave now and never speak of coming here to anyone, ever.No one moved.Good, then lets get on with it, Kramer said.Lesper nodded and marched over to a control panel set in the darkest portion of the room.Reducing all light to the slightest shimmer he revealed an armoured row of metal hatches, all along the far wall and embedded into the black rock from which Section Six was deliberately carved.Araman counted sixteen hatches.What are they?Ketrass asked.Kramer smirked.Not the question you should be asking, Avne my dear.Whats inside?Justus said.Kramer nodded, contented, then he pushed down a lever and the first metal hatch was raised.Behind was a clear screen, and behind that: darkness.Araman stepped forward; his breathing deepened and his heart thudded against his ribs.It was a pen.An enclosure.A cage.Something was in there; he could feel it.Justus and Ketrass moved to his side and the three gazed within.They could make out in the murky light something contained: a large form which they all felt staring back.Lesper paced nearby.What you are about to witness will change the way you see ...everything.What is it?Ketrass whispered.He glanced at her.Look away if you dont want to see.No one looked away.Dont blink if you wish to see it properly, Kramer said.Light is harmful to it.We can only turn it on for a fraction of a second.Araman braced himself and Kramer flicked the switch.Light burst on and then off, and all three fell back at the sight before them, and covered their ears from the blood curdling hiss the likes of which no human or creature thus far witnessed could even dream of making.Ketrass fell to her knees and Araman froze.The creature within, which was large and lean and bearing bone as black as the rock of Erebus itself, was a horned demon.A tight fence of teeth packed into a pointed snout, while many chilling spikes protruded from its head.Araman looked across and saw both Kramer and Lesper smirking at their reaction.The others said nothing, and Ketrass held onto Justus, dragging herself up in a stunned silence.Where did it come from?Justus asked.Lesper breathed in.The creature you just witnessed we found within the Black Labyrinth three months ago.It is a species unimaginable.Dark and ...and ...well, we are still adjusting ourselves.Suddenly Araman wanted to get out of Section Six, immediately.Out of Section Six and away from the black rock moon.Things on Erebus were more sinister than he could ever have imagined.Speak of this to no one other than the Professor and myself, Lesper said quietly as the metal hatch closed again, sealing the creature within.So the light actually harms it?Justus asked.Thats what we said, Kramer replied.And thats where the need for coils comes in?Yes.Anything else you want to know?How many do you have?Araman asked.We journeyed into the Labyrinth, Kramer said.But not far.We brought fifteen of them back with us.F ...Fifteen?!Ketrass stammered.Yes, fifteen.All were in a kind of hibernated state; it was only after moving them that they began to show awareness, movement, and unparalleled hostility.And neither of us thought it necessary to return until we know what were dealing with, Lesper added.What about that one?Ketrass pointed to the cage at the far end.Which one?The sixteenth cage.Above the enclosure was imprinted a word and a number:      SUBJECT 16      Lesper hesitated again.Oh, that.You said you brought fifteen of them back with you.But therere sixteen cages.So whats in that one?Lesper hesitated, and Kramer stepped forward.You dont need to know.You called us down here, Justus said.You wanted to show us your little project.So show us.No.Kramer cleared his throat.I dont think so.You three have important roles within the station.All of you need to know about this because very soon you may be called upon.But I still decide what you need to know.Ketrass bowed her head; shaking and cold she continued to clutch Justus arm.P ...Professor, she said.Youve had them for three months.Youve had ample time to begin studying the species.What do you think it is?Im afraid, Kramer said, we still dont know.But we call it the Beast.Thirty Three      Hold it there!Adra Dimal stopped moving, kept her head down, and grasped the firearm beneath her coat.The large Rotavarian at the head of the Kondogopan checkpoint, now inspecting everyone leaving and entering the capital city, waved her over.Releasing her blaster she left the queue of men and women and approached the border guard.Is it true?she asked him.Kondogopas is liberated?The Rotavarian nodded, a portable data device resting in his hand.So it seems.There are sixteen out there still up for grabs, though.Thats where I come in.Business in Kondogopas?Pleasure.What pleasure?Wouldnt you like to know?Its my job to know.Looking out for Crilshan agents?Looking out for any sort of threat, maam.Less of the maam, please.Paperwork?he asked.I have none.Dastardly Crilshans took them all.The swine!She hid her smirk.World of origin?He tapped his finger on the screen several times.Earth, she lied.Earth?What are you doing all the way out here?Sightseeing.Im stranded.Do you know of a way off world?With those Crilshan turrets they have in Kulikovo I wouldnt suggest risking it.Gotcha.Well, he said, placing his device away, from what I can see you do not qualify for entry into Kondogopas at this time.What?she shouted.You must remain here, maam.Isnt there some sort of arrangement we could come to?Im afraid not.Dimal smiled, coy and bereaved.Id do anything, sir.Anything.He looked her up and down, the sweat dripping down his forehead.I suppose you could ...maybe ...help me out.Lead on.He escorted her to a nearby tent.It was empty but for stores of armour, uniforms, and food rations.The Rotavarian zipped up the entryway and turned.Dimal remained where she was, coat covering her body.He moved slowly towards her and took her wrist, spinning her into a shelving display.She moaned and laughed, and he moved to pull her coat from her.Do I get to see whats under here?I thought youd never ask.He pulled her coat away, revealing her blaster as she flicked it on to stun and pulled the trigger.Thirty Four      GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!Anna recoiled.She leapt up.Her heart thumped, that terrifying word filling her mind as though somebody had been screaming it into her ear as she slept.The orb burned before her and the pale man stood watching.Always watching.She had hoped the nightmares would stop once she had left the bubble of her old home.How wrong she had been.Jon snored beside her.It was nice not having to tie themselves down to rest, and the exhausted traveller glanced out at the stunning view of space, before lying back down, stomach rumbling, and drifting back off.This time, however, she slept a calm, dreamless sleep, unknowing of the fact it would be the last one she would have for a very long time.Jon woke her the following morning; or at least what felt like morning in space.She yawned widely and sat up, grinning.But Jon looked petrified.He was pale and beset with dread.Whats wrong?she asked, glancing around to see Glana stirring beside her.Jon could hardly speak.Its ...its just ...look ...She pulled herself up from the cold metal floor and gasped as she stared out of the porthole at a city in smoke.Black, towering buildings were visible through thick columns of suffocating smog.Fire and battle and ...This isnt Mars.No, he said.Its not.How could this have happened?I ...I dont ...I was so sure.How long should it have taken to reach the Martian Colony?she whispered, not wishing to frighten her sister.She took hold of his hand as he stood beside her.Depending on how urgent the cargo was ...gosh, I dont know ...one, two days, max.Well its definitely been longer than that!I know.Then where are we?Judging from the length of our journey ...hell, I dont know ...I think, maybe ...we could be on one of the outer worlds of the Third or Fourth System for all I know.Yes, but which one?Were on Rotavar, whispered a cold voice behind them.The two spun.Dark eyes gazed at them from the shadows.The figure stood still.A blade rested in his hand and he held a terrified Glana up against him.The barbed blade cut into her neck.Let her go!Anna said.Jon spun on the spot as another figure emerged from the shadows behind.He knocked the two apart and kicked Jon hard in the stomach.Pultzer, snapped the man, stepping out of the gloom and holding a blaster aimed at them.Stand still, children.Gordian, Anna breathed through gritted teeth, watching the scar stretch across his face.This is the colony known as Rotavar, he repeated.First colony of the Fourth System.And, ironically, the first to fall.It appears my people have had more success here than I did on Titan.Samos will be next, and Enustine after that.Titan isnt destroyed?A fragment of hope filled her exhausted mind.The Crilshan stepped forwards again, pointing the blaster at Jons forehead.Now she could see him in the light he looked just like the Crilshans she had seen and heard about, but never in person.He was sallow and sinister, and grinned wickedly, stretching the scar he bore across his cheek and lips further round his lean face.The other Crilshan smirked too, and took hold of Glana, holding his own blade up to her sisters exposed throat.It was shaped much like a coilbolt, except it was longer, and by the looks of it meant for hand to hand combat, displaying smaller spikes all along the twisted edges.You must be young Anna Berenguer, Gordian said.At last.A pleasure to meet you.Drop dead.Gordian laughed.Now do as I say and your sister will be fine.Youre going to come with me, and were all going to walk on down to the command centre.And then what?Jon asked angrily.Then Im going destroy this vessel and the city it resides in, and leave the crew out there with the snivelling populace of this dead rock.He nodded to the large Crilshan who, as though reading Gordians mind, released Glana and walked over to Jon, took out another, smaller blade, and plunged it deep into Jons chest.Anna screamed.A heavy hand struck a blow across her face.Dazed, she could see Glana helplessly struggling and Jon collapse on the deck beside her, clutching his bleeding wound.Come, snarled Gordian, taking her by the hair and pulling her along the ground.It wasnt happening.It was all part of her nightmare.She was about to wake and it would be over.But as the two cursed men dragged the girls away, the faint sound of a voice calling her name as she fought, tears streamed down her face and Anna knew it was all real.She couldnt breathe at the thought of Jons agony and, collapsed in the Crilshans arms, they dragged her away, unmoving and lifeless.Thirty Five      When the black barrages of Crilshar first descended into the seventeen cities of Rotavar, none would have imagined that life and freedom were options still left to the people.But small bands had gathered, the militia mobilised quickly, and guerrilla style fighting taken over.The Rotavarians knew their own land much more than the invaders, who had overconfidently sent their blockading force away to nearby Enusti planetary systems, believing the invasion an unmitigated success.Edgar Mokrikov was gone, but the Rotavarian government survived, in part, as did a portion of the Defence Force.One man fought harder than all others, and Chief Aleksey Vasily sent bands to each city to muster what force could be gathered.They focused on one city at a time and exchanged blows every second of every hour of every day.And so the army fought and marched in this manner.But for Aleksey Vasily the world would have fallen many weeks earlier.The Rotavarians were a strong people; perhaps not in valour and prowess in battle, but in will and resolve they were unmatched.And so the mighty vessel, the Stellarstream, descended onto the landing strip in the centre of Kondogopas; and as before there were no drums or trumpets calling out in glorious salutation, but instead a vicious hail of fire from enemy camps in the nearby cities of Thynia and Svitoslav.Captain Diego Ferranti marched down the meeting platform, at the head of two dozen Titanese Guard, to be met by the leader of the defence.Black smoke soared high on every horizon.The destruction caused by these invaders made the captains blood boil.Hell only knew how the people of the colony felt.Since the main force moved out two standard weeks ago, Chief Vasily told the newcomers, deep inside one of the citys bunkers, which left a garrison of around three legionsthats roughly three thousand enemy combatantsseveral cities have been reclaimed.The northern regions of Paroslav, Kievan, Kidarov, and Kalkara have been liberated, as have our neighbours to the west: RuRikida and Ritova.The majority to the east and south, nevertheless, remain enemy strongholds.He sighed and closed his eyes, leaning on the chart laden table; his leg was bound up tight after what looked to have been a painful injury.Diego Ferranti sat back in his chair on the front row and surveyed the young chief.Very strong for one so young, he thought.The chiefs worn clothes and gaunt, unkempt appearance suggested severe lack of sleep and many weeks of relentless fighting.Not to mention the disfigured nose: a recent break if he knew one to look at.Before Vasily could begin speaking again Ferranti stood and strode up to the front of the group.The chief wavered with fatigue in front of boards and projection screens layered with maps and task files.He took his allys hand and firmly wrapped both of his around it.Youve fought so hard these past weeks, he said, before turning to the whole room.But you are no longer fighting this fight alone!My only regret is that it took so long for us to reach you.I bring word from General Ruben Berenguer.This force is here to honour the promise he made you.Rotavan!Rotavan!the group cheered; Titanese and Rotavarians together.* * *  Come in, Desert Mule.Come in ...Adra Dimal flicked her comm on quietly.The Rotavarian soldiers sat around her were too busy watching the Titanese captain and their own chief up at the front.Reading you, Flux, she said.Im sat in the briefing room now.Everything okay on the ship?Thats a yup, Desert Mule.Stop calling me Desert Mule!Im Desert Fox, remember?Raj Timbur giggled to himself over the comm.It was Noahs idea, he said.No names over this frequency.Whats Noahs sign then?Noah doesnt have one.Stop saying his name!I dont get one?the medic joined in.Noah, go away.This is important.If I dont find out whats going on, well never get out of this bleedin desert!When you coming back?Raj asked.We cant stand it anymore.Give me one more day, okay?Half a day.Fine.Ill be back before nightfall.Deal?Okay.Bring some food back with you.Shrees eaten our rations.Were starving!Right.Well talk later.I have to go.Dimal turned the comm off, smiled in response to the probing look she was receiving from the woman sat nearby, and crossed her legs.The Rotavarians and Titanese burst into applause again at the captain and the chief stood up front.She tried to continue listening in, as shed been doing for the last few days.She figured it was the only way to discover a way off Rotavar.And so there she sat, disguised in the emerald attire of the Defence Force; with a long, thin coat and heavy green boots, she realised what shed been missing all these years.Justus would have been proud if he could see her now.Then again, if he could see her, she wouldnt be sitting there in the first place.Another round of applause and salutes.According to the leaders up front, messengers had been sent to the free cities, and plans made for the liberation of the whole colony; the Titanese army had definitely inspired the ambitious goal.They promised that the losses already suffered would be avenged, and together the chief and the captain made ready their strategy.From what Dimal gathered the greatest concentration of Crilshan warriors was now in the vast city of Kulikovo, situated to the south, just past the smaller cities of Thynia and Svitoslav.By raiding the two towns the Rotavarians and Titanese believed it was possible to draw out the standing force in Kulikovo and match their might in a pitched battle, ambushing the dark army in a pincer movement from the two captured cities.The northern and western forces have been alerted, announced Captain Diego Ferranti.The Defence Force, alongside the militia that has so far come forward, has been prepared.At my command the Cherished Star, now situated on the northern outskirts of Kondogopas, has deployed its soldiers and artillery equipment to the southern side of the city.There it will combine with the two thousand men and women already gathered to fight.Chief Vasily stood and the seated crowd rose too.Dimal, sensing that the room was about to empty, left her seat and made for the exit.Captain Ferranti saluted the crowd.Get some sleep.At dawn we strike.Dimal smiled.No, no.At dawn we escape.Thirty Six      A cold hand touched her face.Anna!Wake up!Anna, please!The terrified murmurs of her little sister roused her.She looked up from the cold, metal floor and gazed around, believing at first that she was in the middle of a battle; the sound of men shouting and cheering roared all around.Whats happening?she asked.Where are we?The viewing bridge?Glana shook her head.The Command Station, at the centre of the ship.Theyre doing something.I dont know what.Glana helped her up.Anna found that, like her little sister, her hands and feet had been bound precariously tight.The sound was coming from outside the vessel, the roar of men and women picked up by transmission.As the focal point of the vessels running, situated in the core of the ship for the greatest amount of protection, the control centre had no windows or portals; the only way in and out was the secure gate which now lay besieged by the dozen bodies of the piloting crew, now unconscious ormost likelydead.The two Crilshans were nowhere to be seen.We need to get out of these things, Anna whispered, aching for their abductors to stay away a little longer.Way ahead of you, Glana said, gesturing with her smaller than average wrists that she had already fought herself free.She began to disentangle Annas restraints when they heard grunts and footfalls approaching.Hurry!she said as Gordians sonorous tone resonated throughout the control room.But it was too late.Anna pushed her sister to the ground and left the unravelled cable around her wrists, falling to the floor and closing her eyes.Just in time.Footsteps entered the room.She chanced a minor glance and saw they were just out of sight, hidden by a large control panel jutting out into the centre of the rounded room.Anna removed the cables from her arms and legs and peered around the metal panel.The two Crilshans were facing away, but a third voice could be heard, less gruff and a great deal more drained than the others.Her heart skipped a beat, believing at first that it was Jon.But she was wrong.Jon still lay in the dark bowels of the ship, bleeding slowly to death.She had to get back to him.But how?Behind Gordian and the other Crilshan she could make out an elderly man, lying propped up against another panel.He was not bound, but looked barely conscious and considerably bruised and bloodied.Glana breathed heavily at Annas side, watching the scene unfold.Now, Gordian said, Ill ask again.Tell me the sequencedont look at me like that.In fact dont look at me at all!I know theres a code.And I know you know it.So tell me  Or else what?the old man challenged.What more can you do to me?You have no idea, old man.There is nothing you can do to me now!Gordian laughed loudly.You Titanese!Such an overconfident race.I need access to the ultimatter engine room  For what?Gordian leaned in and tapped the old man across the face.I imagine, he said, that you know what would happen if I neutralised the ultimatter radiation contained within the engine of this vessel.The old mans face flushed an unsettling shade of white.You cant!An ulti mass ejection would destroy the entire city and every last one surrounding it.Over my dead body!Preferably not, but I wont rule it out!If I dont let you in there, theres nothing you can do.Gordian laughed.I thought youd say that, which is why I brought some ...inspiration for you.He spun, his black gaze aimed in the sisters direction.Anna gasped.His eyes sent a piercing chill, and drawing his blade from his side he swiftly sprang in their direction.But as Anna turned to move her sister out of the way she realised that Glana was already keying something into the command console behind which they had hidden.Help!Glana screamed into the receiver.If youre there, help us!Gordian charged forwards.Return to the vessel!Return to the v  A heavy boot collided forcefully with Glanas mid section and she fell to the floor, winded and gasping for breath.Anna dropped to her side, arms around her, as Gordian stood above them, blade in hand and rage in his eyes.* * *  A thousand soldiers swept through Thynia, city of Rotavar.The sand filled streets were black with ash and bloodied crimson.Debris lay strewn across the road, while heavy smoke poured from every third building.The strangest sight, Diego Ferranti mumbled as he crept through, clutching the back of his neck in perplexed thought.The strangest sight.He holstered his coilbolt and lifted his comm device in an attempt once more to contact the Stellarstream.He could not get through.Captain!A beautiful, dark skinned woman weaved her way through the well spaced march of alert and resolute Guard.What is it, Lieutenant?Word from the Cherished Star, sir, she said, adjusting her belt.Take your time, Avila, he said.What word?Its the legions.Theyve abandoned the eastern cities too!Ferranti looked up at the smoke rising all around them.His Guard had stopped when he did, and subsequently spaced out, searching nearby huts and buildings.But there was nothing.No one.No hint except for the devastation that it had been Crilshans in their place mere hours earlier.Where have they gone, Captain?What do you think, Avila?I think were in for a surprise.I think youre right, he said, checking his comm once again for a signal from his vessel.Still nothing.Thank you, Lieutenant.Avila joined him and they continued through the streets for several more minutes when at last the sound of a hovercraft drew near, and over the surrounding buildings appeared a smoking shuttle.It settled uneasily and Chief Aleksey Vasily stepped out.Surrounded by his own soldiers he hobbled forward and cried aloud, Theyve gone, Captain!Gone?All gone.We found no sign of them in Svitoslav; not in bunker or open structure.Only the prisoners they left behind.And they are in good condition?Ferranti asked.A little worse for wear, Vasily replied.But theyll be fine.Somethings not right, Avila said.Red Eyes never leave prisoners alive.Again, Lieutenant, I think youre right  The ground at once shook beneath their feet.They all turned, half expecting an aerial assault, but instead they witnessed, many miles in the distance, several enormous enemy barrages climb over the horizon.Bright sunlight reflected from their dark hulls a blinding attack, but no harm came to the foes of Crilshar, and the Defence Force and the Guard cheered and cried in unbridled triumph.The spiked sterns of the mammoth vessels were presenteda sure sign that they were in the midst of retreating.Cheers and cries roared out.But the Captain and the Chief waited some while longer before celebrating; the threat from orbit was just as great, if not more so, than that on the ground.And even when colony scans confirmed that the invading force had abandoned Rotavarian space, neither of the two leaders seemed able to congratulate the other.Ferranti knew all too well that the armies of Crilshar never retreated.In hundreds of scenarios and clashes the armies of the Dark Race had never once turned tail and run; they would sooner kill themselves than leave a war unwaged.The Chief must have recognised this as well because he too looked as doubtful and worried as his Titanese counterpart.Whatever their reason for retreat, this change in tactic made Ferranti rightly unnerved.Upon re entering Kondogopas, however, his worry was driven from his mind.Quiet!Quiet!Ferranti shouted at his men and he raised his comm device higher, attempting to make out the screaming voice.Oh, no.Help!If youre there, help us!came a young girls voice.Return to the vessel!Return to the v  The line went dead.* * *  Stupid girl!Gordian threw Anna out of the way and lifted Glana with one hand, launching her across the room and into the wall.She landed, unmoving, beside the old, wheezing man.Theyll come for you now!Anna shouted from behind the panel.Soldiers replies could be heard on the receiver, confirming their return to the vessel and acknowledging that something was wrong.The two of you cant take on everyone!To her surprise Gordian simply laughed, as did the large Crilshan stood at the rooms entrance.I am in command of this vessel now, little girl, he said.And to defend her from my enemies, full defences have been enabled.They will not get back on board.The scar stretching smile filled his face, and he raised his blade until the cold, ridge coiled metal stroked her skin.But you two  Leave them alone!shrieked the old man.Gordian spun as the other Crilshan held his blade to the mans neck.Order me once more, he said, and Pultzer will tear you a new breathing tube.Ill find another way into the engine.The old man gulped, struggling to breathe in the cumbersome position he was held in.Glana still wasnt moving.How are you going to get off the planet?Anna asked, hoping to distract him, or at least keep him talking and give the Guard a chance to get back inside.Surely there was something she could do.If you destroy this ship and the surrounding city, what then?I wouldnt worry about that, little girl.You cant think you would get away.Theyll find you before you escape!She glanced down at the control panel, searching for something.Anything.I wouldnt count on it.Gordian smiled.Look how easily I took this vessel!She looked down again.Nothing she could use.Its not yours yet, she said.And therell be no point if you cant get inside the engine room.A fair argument, he said with another uncomfortable sneer.Just when she was about to give up, Annas hand found what she had been looking for.A marker flashed up on the screen before her.:::: SERENITY COACHING ::::      :::: PREFERENCES ::::      She scrolled through the available options, and found exactly what she wanted:      :::: ACTIVATE ::::      She looked back up into the face of her would be killer.This had better work ...But, Gordian said, pulling a blaster from his coat and pointing it at her, youre missing one vital point.Right now, at this very moment, there is no one here to stop me, but you.His finger touched the trigger.And me!Annas heart leapt.Everyone turned to see the body of the large Crilshan fall to the ground, a knife protruding from the back of his neck.Behind him, staggering, weak, and pale, stood Jon.Impressive, Gordian said, watching Pultzer fall and aiming the blaster in Jons direction.I dont think so!Anna pushed the switch before her.At once the brightest burst of light appeared from behind her.Streaks of burning sunlight surged throughout the room.Gordian cried aloud and staggered back, blinded and covering his face.Anna seized her moment and threw herself at the Crilshan, driving him backward over the central control panel and slamming onto the ground behind it with him.She reached back for the dropped firearm, but could not reach.Gordian struck out at her, but the old man nearby grasped the blade and slammed the hilt into Gordians skull, knocking him out cold.Without thinking Anna charged across the room and held Jon as he lay on his back, staring into the light.He had come for her; he had saved her life and the lives of everybody out there.But there was nobody to save him.He struggled to speak as he lingered on the brink.The dazzling sunrise, a projection of the serenity coaching program, appeared across the wall over a deserted horizon.The light reflected in his eyes as they gazed into Annas.And there she saw it: the calm, the same blissful silence as there had always been between them.Anna didnt need to say anything, caught in that instant which lasted forever.His face was white, his lips blue, and he spoke.Glana ...I ...we ...What?she said, sobbing.What is it?Glana ...And he was gone.His eyes remained open, staring past Anna at the sun drenched ceiling, vacant and frozen like the gap between worlds.Anna threw herself against his blood covered chest, holding him close, and sobbing uncontrollably.It was all her fault.She had killed the man she loved.Thirty Seven      The disturbing gong of a dull and aching bell rang four times.In the haunting darkness, and paired with the blasting rhythm of a serene string orchestra, it would have been inaudible but for Constantine Lespers unmatched sense of hearing.The commander loved nothing more than relaxing in the pitch black and playing the music which was so adored back on Earth.The New Renaissance there had uncovered so many wonderful joys of humanitys past; and he found nothing beckoned him home more than such little comforts as the mood and tone of a cunning concerto.Arising from his large chair he turned off the music and walked across the room to kneel before his master.He should have known better than to relax so heavily knowing today was the day his Cronat called.He never missed a meeting and he was certainly never late.Lesper didnt look at the image which now projected into the room with him.It was better if he didnt look.Commander.The voice of the Cronat rattled through him.I trust all is well on Erebus.Lesper took a deep breath.All is well, Cronat.A shiver flew down his spine.Your lack of communication suggests your mission on Rotavar was a success.I obtained the journal, as you asked.And it has been destroyed?You did not read it?I neither read nor opened it, Lesper said.It has been burned.Again he held his head down and bit his lip.His tone of voice had held firm; the Cronat wouldnt know it in fact remained intact, sitting on the shelf close by.He did not speak Rovaa, but had skimmed through the diary.It truly appeared to be nothing more than a diary.But why didnt the Cronat want attention drawn to any connection between him and the prime minister of Rotavar?What could Edgar Mokrikov know that would be so threatening to the mighty shade before him?And what of your true mission?the Cronat uttered.Do you have the boy?Lesper smiled.He knew hed done well.It was not hard to persuade him to come with me, he said.I only had to mention the word threat and he was mine.Lesper chose not to tell him that he had also used the boy to take the diary.That would be too great a risk.So, is it him?There is a certain likeness, Lesper replied.But as you wisely considered yourself, he would have been a fool not to reconstruct his appearance, or in fact modify his own memories so as to avoid all possible types of detection.If Peter Mar  Lesper cut the phrase short.He realised his mistake as soon as he had made it.He glanced upward as a dreadfully cold wind seemed to fill the room, and he thought the silver masked figure would suffocate him with his metallic stare.If the Forgotten One were to make himself forget he had the gift, he clearly would be unable to use it, he said, attempting to compensate for his error.That is my thought, answered the masked creature after the briefest of silences, but also my fear.It would make finding him all the more difficult.Then we are agreed?Yes, his Cronat said.Test the boy, and we shall see from there where the path of this one lies.Thirty Eight      Rotavar was free.Or as free as a ruined world could be, for today at least.But one thing above all was as clear as the Kondogopan sky to Aleksey Vasily as he stood at the fire damaged entrance to ex Prime Minister Mokrikovs office.It was not over.An orphan from birth, Vasily had always endeavoured to help others.He accepted no reward, nor any advancement up the ranks.Down in the sand with the people of Rotavar is where he belonged.Though not an obvious choice, Edgar Mokrikov had persuaded him to act as a chief of the Defence Force after hed taken part in several military games.Vasily had only accepted because it was the prime minister who had asked.But his position changed nothing.He was a servant of Rotavar and its people.Nothing more.He walked to the broken terrace, past the glass littered carpet and damaged metal desk, and stared at the city.In the distance he could see the Kondogopan landing strip, by which various crafts had been taking off all morning.Free again.Largest stood the Titanese vessel.The massacre on board had been terrible to hear of, but the Chief had pledged whatever assistance he could deliver to Captain Ferranti.It was the least he could do.Though help from Titan had arrived too late and too few, he appreciated the effort.Not that it had helped.It was he who had made the sacrifice.It was he who had saved his people.It was he who had purged Rotavar of the Crilshan plague.A cold wind drifted through the office.His thoughts raced; his heart beat riotously.Aleksey Vasily.I trust all is well on Rotavar.Vasily did not turn.He continued to stare out at the smoke in the distance.All is ...as you wanted it, he replied.The image of the Cronat burned in the back of his mind.You did as instructed?He breathed in deep.I ...did.After your fleet withdrew I ...found your assassin.Hes onboard the Stellarstream.You freed him?No, I ...I gave him the tools to free himself ...when he is ready.It was his idea, his choice.And now your world is free.If you wish for it to remain that way you will carry out one more task.Vasily bowed his head, placed his hands in his pockets.The Stellarstream wont be leaving for some days yet, he said.Once things have been arranged and the bodies of their victims dealt with.But your errand will not wait.No.You have saved your people.Crilshar has left your world.Now you will honour your part of the bargain.Vasily pulled his hands from his pockets and unfolded the small, handwritten letter.The letter he had managed to take the night Antal Justus stole Mokrikovs journal.That letter, said the Cronat, written by Mokrikov for Ruben Berenguer, will be delivered immediately.Personally.You must bring him to me.Then I will destroy him.Vasily closed his eyes.He was a servant of Rotavar and its people.Nothing more.Thirty Nine      Captain Antal Justus marched through the empty hallway of Erebus Station.He inspected his reflection in every polished surface along the way, straightening his dark jacket and even darker hair.Sit down, Captain, Lesper said as Justus entered the office.He sat, nodding to the one eyed professor stood with his arms folded in the corner, his usual air of intensity more heightened than the last time hed witnessed it.Kramer didnt respond.Now, Lesper said.I cant imagine you have any idea why youre here.Well, I know I slept in the other day, Commander.And the other week.And this morning, in fact  Yes, I know.But this has nothing to do with that.Oh ...well.We have a proposition for you, Captain.Im listening.You of course know the reason for your being here.Of course.I am to maintain the security of Erebus station and protect the significance of our mission here.And after what you showed us down in Section Six I understand the need more than ever.Good, Lesper said, clenching his fists with the mere mention of Section Six.Well I have news for you, Captain.Your part in our design is about to change.You may not like what youre about to hear.Your loyalty is going to be tested.Great, he thought; I knew this was too good to be true.How much do you want to remain with us, Captain?A great deal more than I want to leave.Thatll have to do, Kramer said.Your unit has already been briefed on your mission.The details will be provided to you now.Lesper handed him a data disc.Watch this in your own quarters.Alone.Contact either of us if you need anything.You will be leaving the station and heading for an outpost known as Aurora.Im leaving?Yes, Captain.Pack your bag.Youre taking a trip.Forty      You have done well, Captain.Thank you, Diego Ferranti replied, bowing his head.The room was dark.The projected figure stood above deserved nothing less than absolute deference.For goodness sake though.Dont bow.Ferranti looked up at General Berenguer.The man had never looked more formidable.You trust me though, General?To watch over my nieces?With my life, Diego.It had been some time since the General had referred to him by his first name.Protecting the mans family obviously meant more than simple formality and convention.And rightly so.Ill die before anything happens to them, Ferranti said.Ruben laughed.I cant imagine a better man for the job.But keep in mind your official task.You are correct: Rotavars liberation is a worry as much as a victory.What will you do?Focus on my duties here on Titan, he said.Now I know Anna and Glana are safe with you, the greatest weight has been lifted from my mind.The Council, it seems, is finally listening.Though whether the hour is too late remains to be seen.They are in better hands than they were with Lady Pinzn.Of that, Ruben replied, Im not so sure.Well, he said, standing, at least those who matter are safe.Ruben winced.Theres something more, Captain.What is it?Its Callista ...What?I think you had better sit down.Im afraid its not good.* * *  Captain Diego Ferranti marched along the corridors of his vessel, the Stellarstream, acknowledging passing soldiers salutes with a nod and proceeding through several compartments before reaching the holding cells.Following the curious lack of confrontation on Rotavar the majority of cells remained empty.However, held behind clear, reinforced cube caging, fully exposed on all five visible sides, was the man he had come to see.Our friend from Crilshar is unusually talkative, sir, the prison guard said.Yes, well well see if thats so when he speaks with me.Open the door.Gordian was too dangerous to be left alone.Not even for a moment.The door slammed behind Ferranti and he walked over to his prisoner, who merely smirked, arms fixed to the seat beneath him.Captain, he said, I was wondered how long it would take  Ferrantis fist struck a blow across the Crilshans face.Gordian spluttered for a moment, before looking up....you to visit me, he finished.But I must say  You wont say anything, Gordian.Ferranti sat on the clear plastic seating opposite.Not until I say you can.Gordian smiled again.I have spoken with General Berenguer.So hes still alive?Very clever of you to use a decoy explosive on the Surrogate Sun.Your idea?Is that how you see me, Diego?Brawn under brain?Id say you have plenty of both, hence your new dwelling.Ferranti gestured to the clear box in which they were sat.Your efforts to plunge Titan into chaos as on dozens of other worlds have failed.And all youve done there is create a beacon to which the free planets and moons of the Alignment can now rally.Gordian smirked.Involving Berenguers nieces was poorly judged, if you knew a thing of him.The smile widened across Gordians mouth; Ferranti watched the scar stretch across his face with an almost painful elasticity.I can only assume you brought them with us, yes?the assassin asked.You wouldnt leave them back on that pile of rubble.And what of the boy?He did rather well to take out Pultzer like that!Tell me, did he die?Ferranti ignored his agile probing and didnt react.Gordian would pick up on it without having to think.The blade had been forced through the boys ribcage.Of course he had died.He stared at the purple pink scar on his enemys face.Twice weve met in battle, Gordian said.Twice weve fought each other, but Im still ashamed to say Ive beaten you only once.The next time we stand off, which I believe will be soon, then it is you I think that will fall to me.Ferranti chuckled.And what psychotic brainwave would give you that impression?Gordian leaned in.Circumstance, Captain.
