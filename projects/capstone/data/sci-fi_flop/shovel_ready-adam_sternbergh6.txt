In my more sour moods, Id remind her we were about a hundred years and a million dollars too late.Irony is, pretty soon we could have had our pick.That morning she watched me empty a pint bottle into the toilet bowl and made me promise it was the last time, for the last time.She thought the drinking had something to do with the baby, or more to the point, the not baby.Our inconceivable child.Were looking to trade one bottle for another, is how she put it.That was always her joke, when she was in the mood for joking.So I poured out the last bottle and swore never again on various graves.Truth was, I just wanted her to leave.I had an appointment to keep that morning.Besides, it was easy enough to kick the bottle.By that time Id discovered the beds.They drove it straight down from upstate, down the Henry Hudson, left at Forty Second, right into Times Square, no stops.Made the whole trip on one tank of gas.Officials later said if they hadnt blown themselves up they would have died in a few months anyway, just from handling the radioactive waste.Maybe if theyd had second thoughts.Dithered while they withered away in a quiet farmhouse somewhere.The worlds first long term suicide bombers.But they didnt.They drove it straight into the heart of Manhattan.Like a stake.A van stuffed with a bomb stuffed with fertilizer salted with waste lifted from a radiotherapy clinic in foreclosure.Enough to poison twenty city blocks.Crude stuff.But somehow fitting.A bomb made of shit and someone elses trash.Pulled to a stop outside a TGI Fridays.Whispering a final fevered prayer.Back doors blew open and gave birth to a toxic cloud.Shattered windows.Splattered tourists.Glass.Blood.Sirens.Smoke.Screams.Hair.Bones.Ashes.Skin.Flesh.Charnel carnage.Almost biblical.A loosed plague.We fought that morning, like many mornings, like most.I was back from my leave, back at work but not really, and not often.And she was just starting to realize that Broadway was a lot more crowded than a high school stage in Jersey.Still, she went to her classes, and to her auditions, and failed, then came home and we went to bed, and failed at that too.So the rest of the time we fought.At least that we were good at.Times Square closed for cleaning and never reopened.They kept telling us the radiation wasnt that bad.You can easily endure small exposures, they said.No worse than a few X rays at the dentist.The city issued handheld Geiger counters for free.Became a bit of a hip accessory for a time.Cool young kids clickety clicking their way through the city, counters slung around their necks like tourists cameras.Even turned into a popular pickup line.Approach a young woman.Hold up your Geiger counter.Whoa, I think Ive found a hot spot.Crafty vendors pitched card tables on sidewalks around the city, swapped out I Love New York t shirts for I Survived Times Square.Set out rows of little plastic glow in the dark Empire State Buildings and Statues of Liberty, a tiny toxic skyline.Funny idea, sick but funny, but there were no tourists around to buy them.And no native wanted an I Survived Times Square shirt when you couldnt really be sure yet that you had.The mayor preached calm.As a stunt, he sat down for dinner in the middle of empty Times Square, ate a five course meal with his wife.Silverware, candlesticks, white coated waiters, white linen tablecloth, violinist, the whole thing.Dabbed his mouth with a napkin, turned to the TV cameras, proudly declared: Tell the world.New York is open for business.Didnt matter.The tourists never returned.Thats a hard sell, even with three for one specials on hotel suites.All the businesses failed.They were built on selling M&Ms and I Love New York shirts to visitors.Problem was, no one was hungry for candy and no one loved New York anymore.The violinist came down with a rare sarcoma and died the following Easter.The mayor sent an aide to the funeral.Dirty bomb killed all the dogs in the city too.All of them.No ones ever figured that one out.The president came.Made a speech from a safe distance.Reminded us that America always rebuilds.Recovers.Rises again.Then he rose again.In a helicopter.A couple of weeks later, the first car bomb went off.Near the United Nations.People watched live on the news and hoped it was just a faulty taxi, burst into flames.That kind of thing used to happen.People watched and hoped.Until the second one went off.Took out the news crews.Then a few days later, another.Then another.Over the next few weeks.Not often.But often enough.The president made another speech, this time from the Oval Office.Preempted football during half time, sent his condolences and ordered in the National Guard.Promised the country was behind us, wed spare no effort in seeking justice, then signed off with a God Bless America and God Bless New York, just in time for the second half kickoff.Every day, right before shed leave to face another parade of smiling rejections, shed stand and steel herself at the front door, hand poised on the first of the locks.Beyond that door was the fiery furnace.We had to trust together that each day we wouldnt be consumed.Burned up.Venture out on faith.Like that old Sunday school story.Me Shadrach.Her Meshach.Still hoping for an Abednego.And every day my Stella said the same strange thing, paused there at the door.Said it mostly to herself.See you on the other side.Every day she said that.Even the last one.Within a month Times Square was dead and rotting, beyond resuscitation, and the rot spread out in circles from there.But by that point no one cared.Its not that we didnt care about the attacks.We were New Yorkers, after all.Battle scarred.We rattled our swords.We gathered in the streets, held candles, demanded justice.Demanded vengeance.We knew how this worked, wed done it before.We hounded the brown faced.Jumped a few Sikhs in our ignorance.A few Brazilians.Gave gay bashers license once again to work out their issues on swarthy civilians.We were indiscriminate in our discrimination.It wasnt that we didnt care about the bombings.We just didnt care about the city.Not really.Not that part.Not those streets.Most native New Yorkers, to be honest, had abandoned Times Square long ago.Thought of it mostly as a tourist preserve.Cursed the bright neon signs, the Naked Cowboy, and whatever errands might bring you there on a crowded Saturday to fight through the sluggish global herd.It wasnt long before native New Yorkers were all making the same grim jokes.Times Square?Roach bomb.Ha ha ha.Or, Times Square?Ive heard it really glows at night.Or, Times Square?They finally figured out a way to get a tourist to step aside on the sidewalk.Or, Times Square?They bombed it?Well, who among us hasnt thought of doing that at least once?But the reality was that the walls had been breached and the tourists stopped coming and the streets emptied out and soon the rest of the people started packing up too.Some skyward, to glass penthouses and the lure of the limnosphere.Most just outward, to some other city without a toxic tumor in its midsection.The car bombs didnt help.Americas big, and the long recession had hollowed out most of the rest of the East Coast, so it wasnt that hard to up and move, to find another house, on another block, in another neighborhood, another job, another chance, in another city that wasnt suddenly halfway poisonous.Where you didnt have to stand and sniff the wind each morning from your doorway and try to gauge just how much death you could smell in the air, and whether today it was blowing toward you.Incremental Apocalypse became the term of choice.Coined by some newspaper columnist, in an angry rant about the city quietly dying.No zombie overrun.No alien armada.No swallowing tsunami.No catastrophic quake.Just the gradual erosion of the will to stick it out.A trickle became a stream became a torrent became an exodus.So, sure, Times Square?Times Square didnt kill too many New Yorkers.But it killed New York.The day it happened, I was in Chinatown sleeping.Deep in a custom made dream.Stooped over, wringing my hands in a waiting room.Then slapping backs and unwrapping cigars.Bright blue balloons kissing the ceiling.Congratulations all around.My wife died in that first one, the one on the subway.The small one.The diversion.On her way to acting class.In the months after I could only hope she was riding in the first car.I hope she was standing right next to the bomb.I hope she picked up that damned gym bag, unzipped it, poked her head in, right before it detonated.I hope it blew her to dust.I hope that she didnt lay wounded, twisted, in the darkness of that tunnel, waiting for sirens, waiting for help, hearing them carefully make their way down, advancing step by step through the wreckage, then die in the second explosion.Everyone who was left died in the second explosion.I hope she died in the first one.The diversion.Thats what passes for hope these days.21.On my way back to Marks I make a detour to Hells Kitchen.Radio Citys too expensive to rent out on anything but Sundays, so Harrow has a Paved With Gold outreach center here, set up in a tidy storefront which is yawning awake just as I arrive.Strapping gents set out the pamphlet rack, while a wholesome blonde in a knee length skirt sparks up the coffeemaker.Everyone has the whiff of missionary.Look too healthy to have been in New York for long.I spot the clean cut usher from the other night.Not in his suit now.Sharp slacks and a flowered Hawaiian.Looks like a Beach Boy.I sit down in a folding chair opposite his desk.Uncrease my brochure.Tell me more.I get the full pitch: Fully subsidized dreaming on a pastoral country campus, a hundred acres, wholly owned and maintained by Crystal Corral Ministries.In essence, you sign on to serve the church, maybe do a tour of service in an urban outreach center like this one, maybe work some time doing labor on the Paved With Gold farm.For example, he says, hes from out west, California, and after this month long stint in our fair city hes heading straight to Paved With Gold to tap in for the first time.Moreover, he assures me, the tours of duty are short and the requirements minimal.In fact, the church has had such a good response, he says, leaning in, beckoning me forward, like were buddies and hes letting me in on a secret deal, they cant find enough work for all the applicants.So some people get to go straight to heaven.Do Not Pass Go, etcetera.As for heaven: He hasnt been yet so he cant presume to describe it.But its wholly scriptural, a hundred percent accurate, designed according to biblical teaching.You can visit for a day, a week, a month, he says, its the ultimate time share.I can tell hes used that line before.Like a good salesman, he hasnt mentioned cost.So I mention it.Plead poor.Im just a garbageman.He laughs.Look at me.Think Im a billionaire?Economy the way it is?And trust me, California is even worse.Leans in again.There is no cost.How can that be?He tents his fingers.I can tell this is his favorite part of the pitch.Pastor Harrow pays the freight.With the money he raises through the church.Heaven should not require a golden ticket, as he likes to say.Just a golden heart.This same quote runs across the bottom of the brochure.The Beach Boy continues.Think of it like the Army.They sign up thousands and it costs nothing to join.In fact, they pay you.Well, this is like that.Its Gods army.Theres no point in building a heaven if you havent got anyone to walk its golden streets.Thats Pastor Harrow also.I figured.Ill tell you this.You sign up today, I can have you at our farm by this time tomorrow.Morning after that, youll wake up in Glory Land.And where is all this exactly?The Crystal Corral compound.South Carolina.Beautiful site.Seems far.From this?Are you kidding?I cant wait to get out of this hellhole.No offense.I stand up.Tap the brochure on the desk.Ill think about it.When you make up your mind, well be here.Maybe not me, but definitely someone who can help you.But Ill be gone.Ive got an appointment to keep.Appreciate your time.No worries.God bless you.I figure the Beach Boy for a greenhorn.Another round of soothing hallelujahs and he might have closed this sale.You let me wriggle off the hook too easy, rookie.Then I turn around and notice the line behind me thats waiting for my spot in the chair.22.By the time I get back to Trump Tower, Rick the tech head is long gone and Marks up and around, out of his bed, unplugged, wearing a robe, drinking a coffee.He pours me one and offers me a bagel.Good morning, Spademan.I believe the last time I saw you, it was in a country church where you were moonlighting as a doormat.Very funny.Thanks for that, though.I mean it.Well, Rick and I figured you might need a cavalry.You two do that often?Crash other peoples private meetings?Not as a rule.But if you ever need to do it, Rick is definitely the best.Knows how to find the seams and how to slip you through them.I did enjoy the look of surprise on their faces.You mean the faces you didnt bury your little toy ax in?Mark shrugs.Hey, I may not be much help in this world, but when you spend enough time on bed rest, you tend to pick up a few party tricks.So thats what you do in there all day?Fly around and hack people to pieces?No.That was special for you.Though I do like to spread my wings once in awhile.I nod toward Marks bed.Luxury liner like that, why the hell do you ever go all the way down to Chinatown?You know me.I like congregations.The comforts of a like minded crowd.Persephone pads out of the bedroom.Wearing sweatpants.Scratches at bedhead curls.Good morning.What I miss?Eyes my bagel.God, Im starving.Is there one of those for me?I hand it over.Nice sweatpants.What happened to snakeskin?She frowns.They split.Given that I can now be fairly sure there are no professional killers actively stalking us, at least not in the nuts and bolts world, I decide to be nice and treat everyone to a proper lunch.Mark suggests we head to the shopping mall next door.It was built as a sparkling lure, baited with luxury goods, but its not so luxurious anymore and no ones biting.A few fancy restaurants still survive, catering to the dreamers upstairs, sending up five star takeout, but the stores have all shuttered, most of the malls abandoned, and all thats left of the jewelry boutiques and clothing stores are faded poster ads, peeling behind glass, selling shiny stuff you can no longer buy at shops that are no longer there.In their place, now theres squatters stalls mostly, set up illegally, lining the mall in long rows in front of the emptied out stores.Mall owners turn a blind eye, collect payments in cash, figure at least the street market keeps foot traffic up, wards off squatters who come in from the park.Figure all the old businesses packed up anyway, heading for higher ground.Let the nomads move in, pitch a tent.Plant a flag.Many different flags, actually.Vendors shout for attention as we pass, hawking wares, stalls stacked with everything from dried spices to saris to sjamboks, those leather African half whips, made as snake killers and crafted from rhino hides, sold here for self defense.Thats the pitch anyway.Salesman demonstrates, slicing the air with a whistle as we walk.Cuts close to Persephone.She jumps, then curses.Salesman looses a goofy grin.She flips him double birds.Then we head to the food court, which is just a cluster of food carts, run by guys who broke in the back way.Carts serve up dishes for a dollar, curries and dosas and kebabs.Flaming grills and sizzling griddles.The tempting scents of spiced steam.Everything looks delicious, though a few carts offer meats you wouldnt want to know the family tree of.Luckily all the vendors have the same strict food policy: No Questions Answered.We retire to a bench in the mall with hot meals on our laps, not a utensil between us, a war council with paper plates.I go to dig in when Mark bows his head to say grace.Persephone follows.I succumb to peer pressure.Mark with his eyes closed.Lord we thank you for this bounty we are about to receive.At first I think hes making a joke.Apparently not.Lord and thank you for watching over us and keeping us safe so far.Let our actions on this day as on every day glorify your name in every way.Amen.Amen.Amen.I take a bite and ask the obvious.Okay, Harrows shown his hand.So whats our brilliant plan?Mark eyes Persephone.She shouldnt be here for this.Its okay.She can hear this.Mark shoots me a look.This is the look that says hes probably a little more qualified than me in the arena of emotional counseling.Hes right.But I dont budge.She can hear this.He frowns.Then proceeds.All right.Well.Theres three potential outcomes, as I see it.You give him what he wants.You kill him.He kills you.Those are the only options.Persephone pipes up.Or I can run.Ive been running.You dont even need to know which direction I went.Mark wipes his mouth.Thats not an outcome.Thats a delaying tactic.Eventually this ends.In one of those three ways.He looks to me.You a baseball fan?No.Jets fan.Not by choice.By blood.Well, in baseball theres this thing the statisticians call the three true outcomes.Its the three possible outcomes of an at bat that only involve the actions of the pitcher and the hitter, and none of the other players on the field.So theyre considered the purest possibilities.Okay.And they are?Mark counts them out on his fingers.A walk.A strikeout.A home run.Thats it.The three true outcomes.I think of lesson two of hauling garbage.You discard it.It discards you.Or you die.Three true outcomes.Okay.I got it.So?Mark pauses, then gives me a look.This is the look that says hes about to tell me something he doesnt want to tell me.Go on, tell me.Theres another factor.Whats that?This Simon.The Magician.What about him?Hes a factor.Because?For starters, hes between you and Harrow.I can take care of him.Like you did in that church?Thats not fair.That was in there.Thats the dream.Were out here now.Even so.Im on better footing out here.Still.Im just saying.Hes a factor.You dont even know what he can do out here.Or who he really is.He could be eighty years old, for fucks sake.My guess?Hes not.So I turn to Persephone.What do you know about him?Simon?You saw him.And?He is what you think he is.Meaning?Hes that bad.Hes worse.Out here?Hes worse.Mark chimes in.What about money?Can he be bought?She laughs.If youre planning to outbid my father, thats not an auction were going to win.I press her.Okay.So what is he not good at?I dont know.Whatever it is, I havent seen it.Hes ruthless.Hes smart.And hes not someone you can reason with.And dont expect any sympathy.Or mercy.All right.No reason.No sympathy.No mercy.That narrows our options, at least.Persephone runs both hands through her unkempt curls.Tugs at tangles that refuse to untangle.Looks down at her feet.Then tells us something more.He was my bodyguard.For how long?Until I ran.So hes not a great bodyguard.At least theres that.It wasnt his fault.He was supposed to protect me.He wasnt my babysitter.And I wasnt his prisoner.And he did a good job?Of protecting you?Sure.From everyone but my father.Mark reaches out, takes her hands in his.Mark the former pastor.Knows ways to balm wounds.I say to Mark: I still want to hear your three true outcomes.Sure.Yes.Three true outcomes, like I said.You give him the girl, he kills you, you kill him.Walk, strikeout, home run.Only the pitcher and the batter have a say in it.Okay.In this case, Harrows the pitcher.Youre the batter.He motions to Persephone.Were just the fielders.Okay.Meaning ultimately you have to decide.Okay.In that case, I choose the home run.All right.Wait.So which one is that again?Very funny.I put my hand on Persephones, lightly.But that means you and I need to have a conversation.Marks apartment, an hour later.Two chairs pulled up by the picture window.Marks run off to Chinatown, day trip to the land of Nod.She and I watch the campers in the park.Weird to think I was down there with them a few days ago.Didnt sound like it was too much fun.It had its ups and downs.You know them.You lived with them.You think theyll last long in there?Police have it locked down.Nothing in, nothing out.Theyll last.The thing I dont understand is, what exactly are they protesting?Theyre not protesting anything.They just want to live in a different kind of world.Figured you have to start building it somewhere.Sure, but why Central Park?Why not Woodstock?Or Utah?Take a look at the park.At this city.At this moment.Its all kind of up for grabs, dont you think?So you know what this means.Yes.You okay with it?Time was, I thought I might do it myself.Dreamt about it.Nothing happens unless you say it can happen.I know.Thank you.She folds her hands over her belly.I didnt think it would end like this.I just wanted to get away.Well, what he did, thats going to follow you.Hes going to follow you.I know.And its not like hell give you up.I know.Before this goes any further, I need to get something straight.Okay.When I saw your father, he showed me pictures.Okay.Of you.Okay.Said you took them.I did.Said you sent them to your boyfriend.I did.They werent meant for public consumption, obviously.But you know teenagers.Were stupid sometimes.Trust the wrong people.We all do that.Did he tell you where he found them?He said someone from the congregation brought them forward.Hmmm.Well, thats bullshit.My father trolls for that trash all the time on the Internet.Just so happened, one day, he clicked a link, saw his own daughter.In among all the usual naked jailbait he prefers.Just bad luck, really.For me, anyway.He also told me something else.That your boyfriend is the father.A dry laugh.No.That asshole fucked me over plenty, but not in that way.Your father says it isnt his.Well, what do you expect him to say?I just mean that, if youre running for some other reason, whatever it might be, I need to know.She straightens.If any of this is acting, her look right now would win the Oscar.Wait, what are you saying?You want to send me back to him?I need to know what made you run.Because you didnt run at first.When you found out about the baby.You waited.For a few months at least.I was scared.My father has a long reach.As you know.But then something made you leave.Yes.Thats true.Gnaws her lip.Says to me, her voice catching: Just tell me youll protect me.Ill protect you.Say it again.Ill protect you.Say it again.Ill protect you.She turns.Tears poised on her lower lids, peering over the edge, like jumpers on a ledge.Yep.Just what I thought.Sounds just the same coming out of your mouth as it does out of everyone elses.Grace Dont.I will.I swear.Ill protect you.Jumpers teeter.Dont make me go back to him.Dont make us.If what you told me is true Its true.well, then, I dont think your father can be forgiven.At least not by anyone hes bound to meet on this Earth.Certainly not by me.And not by you.She looks back out over the park.Youre right.When I found out, I stayed.I thought maybe he would forgive me.He would still love me, love us, if I stayed.So that wasnt why I ran away.No?Jumpers jump.Free fall.Straight plummet down her cheek.Followed quick by more jumpers.Theyre all jumping now.She looks at me.No.And its not the most unforgivable thing hes ever done.23.So at first the rough plan was, we hold tight until Harrow arrives in Manhattan, when we know hell be here, hell be tapped out, and hell be walking among the living.Grace told me that on his New York trips, he likes to meet with his top donors, the ones he calls the Deacons Circle, show them a little Christian love.Then, of course, theres the Crusade itself, with Harrow preaching in public to an overflow crowd.Yes, there will be a hundred bodyguards and twenty thousand witnesses.I said it was a plan.I didnt say it was a good plan.But we thought, maybe a sniper shot.Sideswipe the motorcade.Finagle a face to face, rush the podium, take him down in a kamikaze tumble.That was the plan, such as it was.Until Persephone told me her story.The rest of it.The part she hadnt told to anyone.So Persephone had a best friend.Rachel.She was a few years younger than Persephone.More beautiful than Persephone too, at least to hear Persephone tell it.Troubled girl.Lost her parents young.Came to church with an aunt and uncle.Caught Harrows eye.A long while back.He took an interest.When Rachel was young, maybe ten, Harrow became a kind of surrogate father.He wasnt around much, given his schedule, but he provided for her.Showed her favor.She was over at the house enough that she and Grace became like sisters, more or less.They always joked that Grace was like Heidi, living carefree in the Alps, and Rachel was like Clara, the sickly cousin come to take the mountain air.They grew up together.They got older.She even warned Grace against dating that boy who asked for the photographs.One night Harrow called Rachel into his study.She thought maybe he was going to talk to her about offering to help her with college.Hed always been so generous.Even so, that was still a few years away.Instead he told her about this marvelous new ministry.Paved With Gold.I want you to be one of my very first angels, is how he put it.He personally escorted her to the camp.She could barely believe it.The famous T.  K.  Harrow, with her on his arm.She never went to prom so this felt to her like prom night.He delivered her to the doorstep and said he couldnt wait for her to come back and tell him just how real the new heaven he was building felt.She entered the camps main building, which was built to look like a barn.Sodium lamps floated in the dark rafters.Beneath them there lay a checkerboard of hundreds of white sheeted cots.But only a dozen dreamers so far, tapped in here and there.My pilgrims, Harrow had called them.When she walked in, the nurses stood to applaud her.Shed worn the best dress she had.Ironed it twice.The empty beds laid out so lovingly.Kindly nurses to tuck you in under sheets that smelled like spring.A scent that was hard to place, maybe gardenias.The tube slides in painlessly.The nurse leans over and you say a prayer together.She wears a white folded cap, pinned to her hair, like an old time nurse.She kisses your forehead.You assure her youll see her again soon and tell her all about it.She says she sure hopes so, but she also tells you that, for a lot of people, when they get to heaven, they dont ever want to tap out again.You smile, and get drowsy, your eyelids drop like a heavy curtain at the end of a play.And you swear to yourself in that last waking moment, even as you still feel the loosening grip of the nurses hand slip away, that you hear the distant lullaby of harps, youre absolutely sure that you can.At Harrows personal orders they tapped her out temporarily and put her under quarantine in an adjacent infirmary, where Rachel lay for a few hours in locked restraints in a sick bed, wondering exactly which of these two worlds she was torn between was the horrible dream.Normally no one would have been allowed to see her, but she got word out to Grace Chastity through a junior pastor whod long harbored a crush on her.Grace Chastity still had some special privileges also, daughter of the minister and all.At this point, Grace wasnt showing yet.So when she got word she came to Rachels room at night and visited Rachel and Rachel said nothing.She just smiled and strained against her cuffs as Grace stroked her cheek and she cried.Then Rachel asked Grace if she still carried that knife.What are you talking about?Please dont ask me anything.Just help me get out of here.Dont ask me why just please help me get out of here.So Grace tugged at the locked restraining strap and then, thwarted, pulled from her boot the five inch knife which shed been carrying every day since that night when her father thundered drunkenly into her room, waving a tablet, bright with pictures of her, like he was Moses catching the fallen praying to the golden calf.The night that shed reflexively clutched the covers to her chin, as though they offered some protection, rather than simply something else for him to strip away.Grace sawed through the first restraint.Rachels right hand sprang free.Then Grace circled the bed to cut free her other arm but she couldnt get the angle right on the restraint and Rachel said here let me have it I can reach it better than you can so Grace in a thoughtless moment gave her the blade.And Rachel without hesitation slashed it brightly across her bound left wrist then plunged it into her chest, plunging and plunging, smiling at Grace Chastity and saying good bye good bye I love you I love you I hope I will see you again one day.What Grace would clearly remember forever is how she plunged with such anger, as though to drive something out.Saying let this blood wash me clean oh Lord please Lord as she bled red widely on the stiff white sheets, until her strength drained away and she was lost in the swallowing stain.And Persephone stood over her, and she took back the blade, and she kissed her friend on the forehead, and wiped the blade clean, and then she ran.24.I take the brochure from my pocket, unfold it, lay it out flat on the coffee table.PAVED WITH GOLD.WHY WAIT?Change of plan.No sniper shot.No side on suicide motorcade collision.No kamikaze attacks, no stealthy slit from the shadows.No surprises.No sudden oblivion.Because Harrow needs to know.He needs to know who.And he needs to know why.I fold the brochure and hide it in my pocket and dont tell anyone this as we sit in Ricks Chinatown flat, his sofa as shapeless as a deflating dinghy, and the three of us, me, Rick, and Mark Ray, all trapped on it together like survivors on the first day of month number two, adrift at sea.Persephones pregnant.Persephone gets a chair.Mina Machina, Ricks live in, comes slouching out of the kitchen, slurping at something steaming in a bowl.Shes got long hair and shes alarmingly skinny, so she looks like a long wooden stand built to hold up a black wig.The wig could use a brushing too.She giggles at something only she hears or understands, then lets the hot bowl slip and spill with a clatter.Classic tapper.Still dreaming.She retrieves, then wrestles with, a mop, which in her hands looks like an identical twin held upside down, hair shocked white.I ignore her and lay out the plan to the room.We need to find a way to get to Harrow while hes here in New York for his crusade.As Mark said, theres only two ways this ends.We either hand over Persephone or we convince Harrow to stop asking.Were going to go with the second one.Ill handle that part.Mark shoots me a look.This is the look that says Im lying, because he actually said there were three ways this could end.But I figured Id leave out the outcome where Harrow kills me.In any case, thats for me to worry about.I continue.Lay out phase two.The post Rachel part of the plan.Rick, we also need to find a way to gate crash Paved With Gold.We need to get into Harrows heaven and get everyone out.Everyone.Rick looks perplexed.Sparks a cigarette.You want to crash heaven and then send everyone home?
