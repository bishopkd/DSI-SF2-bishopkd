The fact that half a dozen of them had been contracted for the mission showed the importance the Triad placed on its successful conclusion.None of the six expressed the least doubt as to the outcome even as they wondered why so many of them were deemed necessary to carry it out.Someone brought the tired Volksmann a hot cup of synthetic civet mocha, heavily sugared.It was a good team, he mused to himself as he drank.Once given the assignment he had brought them together himself.Better to overpay for additional competent help than leave anything to chance.There had been no predicting the sandstorm, of course, but the rough conditions would result in only a momentary delay.In fact, if the last reading they had taken on the position of the targets was correct, he and his people could probably just step out of the floater and walk up to their quarry while they slept.For certain they would be bundled up and resting while they waited for the storm to subside.The last thing they would be expecting to encounter under such conditions was company.The scenario would play out precisely as Volksmann liked it.No muss, no fuss.A quick in and quick out, long before their presence could be detected by roving searcher drones.SICK, Inc.security was excellent, but it was not omnipotent.His attention was drawn to movement in the passenger compartment behind him.Relieved to be able to set aside their restraining, confining harnesses, the members of his team were standing, stretching, and joking about the storm.I dont like it when theres more ground in the air than underfoot, muttered Chenwa.Long and lanky, he let his melded left arm twitch back and forth across the floor.Half tentacle and half whip, it could pop out an eye with a single snap.Presenting the inoffensive appearance of a French grandmother, the diminutive elderly woman standing next to him and joining him in gazing out one of the floaters windows was neither.Her name was Isgard Fleurine, she was in her late twenties, and she had chosen to undergo the maniped old age meld out of pure professionalism.No one expected a grandmother to be able to scale sheer walls with her bare handsor throttle a fully grown Natural.Volksmann knew she was quite capable of that and more.The remainder of his people were an equally eclectic mix of Naturals and Melds.Each one brought different strengths to the team.With luck no exertions out of the ordinary would be required.With luck he ought to be able to carry out the mission all by himself.It had been given to him because he always fulfilled whatever task the Triad assigned to him.Experience had made him a firm believer in backup.As far as Meyer Volksmann was concerned there was no such thing as overkill.I need some air.The speaker was a partial Meld named Hideki.With his thick glasses (he had stubbornly refused the melds that would have rendered them unnecessary) and short, squat stature he looked like an accountant or pharmacist.In other words, plainly harmless.In his career, harmless Hideki had killed more people than most who opted for employment in certain stressful professions.He glanced questioningly toward his boss.Volksmann was no barking martinet.You couldnt be and still maintain control of so many edgy personalities.If you want to stick your ass out in this, Hiro, go ahead.Just dont go far.He checked a readout.Its still hours until sunup and I dont want to lose anybody.Were very close to target.When this verdammt storm stops I intend to conclude the mission as quickly as possible and get the hell out of here.He did not blink as he met individual stares.Anyone not back on board at that time is welcome to try walking out.Hideki bulged his eyes and fluttered his fingers.OoooIm all shaky scared!A couple of his companions laughed.Fleurine giggled.Volksmann ignored them.Though this was regarded as a fairly simple, straightforward mission, a degree of tautness still ran through every one of the participants.Not from concern over their innocuous targets but because a chance encounter with feared SICK security was a real and far more serious concern.In the end only Xiau joined the voluble Hideki in stepping outside.As they emerged, both turned their faces away from the howling wind.Blowing sand peppered their exposed necks.The smaller man straightened his glasses, whose special lenses were wirelessly seamed to his own optic nerves, stretched, and took a deep breath.Ahhfresh air!Xiau did not inhale deeply.Its good to be out of that slay locker, but fresh?He wiped steadily accumulating grit from the back of his neck, above the collar.You could plant this stuff.Hideki smirked at his colleague.You have no appreciation for Natures wonders.Maybe if I had a baleen nostril meld like you I could appreciate it more.Your throat and sinuses are gunk protected.And since when did you develop an appreciation for Nature?It has always been a part of me.The internal optics balanced on his nose flexed suddenly, reporting movement that was not wind borne.Tensing, he turned in the relevant direction.As soon as his glasses allowed him to identify the source of the unexpected motion he relaxed.Here, Ill prove it to you.Preternatural reflexes that were a combination of biosurge enhanced muscles acting in concert with his lenses allowed him to pull his sidearm, raise it, aim and fire all in one continuous motion.Despite his own perceptive skills Xiau was barely able to track the blur that was his colleagues gun arm.On a ridge among the scrub, something unseen squealed in pain.Straining to penetrate the storm, Xiau saw nothing and said as much.What the hell are you shooting at?He cast an uncomfortable glance in the direction of the floater.Volksmann will be pissed.Aw, levity a little, will you.Ever seen one of these?Hideki held up his pistol for his associate to admire.Fully chromed, it glistened in the light shining out through the floaters windows.The shells are tapered penetrators, make hardly any noise, and theres no muzzle flash.He gestured with the collapsible barrel.Its not like weve got an audience.Our target isnt going anywhere and a company searcher would have to be perched on your head to notice anything.Shielding his eyes, Xiau continued to peer in the direction of the low ridge.Brush fringed it like a Hulis hair.I still dont see what you were shooting at.Thats because I shot it, wallet head.Suddenly he pointed.Hey, theres another!See it there, popping up and down?Raising his weapon he took aim for a second time.This is like an antique shooting gallery.Very obliging of the local fauna to supply a means for alleviating our boredom.Mine, anyway.Sure enough, a second shot produced a second scream.This time Xiau, his attention focused in the right direction, clearly saw something small and slender disappear as the burst from his colleagues gleaming weapon struck home.Nice shot.Wonder what it was?Hideki shrugged, hoping another play target would present itself.Disappointingly, the ridge remained clear.He finally holstered his pistol.No idea.Looked kind of like a big rat.He pushed his glasses a little farther back on his nose and the internal optics immediately realigned themselves.A short flick of pain behind his eyes indicated that the momentarily interrupted contact had been reestablished between the technology on his nose and the nerves in his head.He no longer even noticed the occasional discomfort.I guess the other rats got the message.He sounded disappointed.This little outing is making me hungry.I could do with an ability bar before we go to work.Xiau nodded, the two small deaths his companion had inflicted already forgotten.From what Volksmann says, the whole thing should only take a few minutes.Seems like a waste of money, six of us for this.Hideki nodded toward the floater.Yeah.I imagine Volksmann just needed one backup.Everyone else is dead weight.Including me?Through the darkness and blowing sand Xiau eyed the other man sharply.Especially you.Youre just a paid kiss ass anyway.Ah, but a very well paid kiss ass.Be careful my kiss ass doesnt suggest cutting your subsist.That wouldnt be ason of a bitch!Expecting to locate the source of the sudden excruciating pain, Hideki looked down at himself as both hands plunged toward his lower body.The foot long length of sharpened and polished bone that had been rammed into his groin was shocking in its whiteness.Even more shocking was the presence of several giant rats clinging to the end of it.As he drew his own sidearm it struck a stunned Xiau that the creatures were not rats.Even cloaked in darkness and partially obscured by the horizontally whipping sand it was evident they were something completely different.They were, he quickly decided, clones of the small shape that the seriously wounded Hideki had casually blasted from the top of the scrub covered ridge.They were also clearly hostile, unexpectedly treacherous, and needed to be dealt with swiftly.Next to him Hideki had dropped to the sand and was still clutching at himself.Blood poured from between his fingers and he was screaming like a baby.Experience and highly trained reflexes came into play as Xiau took aim at the nearest of the murderous creatures.He would kill all of them and see them served to poor Hideki on a platter, skewered and well seasoned.But despite his skill with a gun he was having trouble drawing a bead on any of the little assailants.The damn things moved like little cheetahs.Not in a straight line, either.They zigged and zagged unpredictably, scampering about like small soldiers who had been taught how to keep themselves from being targeted.One bullet and then a second tore into the sand and soil, sending gouts of grit vomiting into the air that the wind whipped away as rapidly as they rose.A voice sounded from the floater as the door opened and a figure appeared in the opening.What the shinobi is going on out there?Something hit Xiau in the left thigh.Wincing at the sudden sting but not daring to look away from where his weapon was tracking, he started backing toward the floater as fast as he could, sweeping the darkness with the muzzle of the gun he now held tightly in both hands.A second thumping pain struck his leg, just above its predecessor.Compelled to look down, trying to peer through the whipping sand, a glint of metal caught his eye.The two pieces of salvage that had been thrust into his flesh had been beaten and pounded with rocks into a pair of crude knife points.Spreading stains surrounded the wounds.Somewhere in the distance Hidekis screams had given way to moaning sobs that were barely audible above the steady roar of the storm.Xiau turned toward the floater and yelled.Im hurt!Hidekis down!I need help!Professional that he was, Volksmanns second in command fought through the pain as he half limped, half dragged himself toward the transport.As he drew near he was relieved to see that a couple of his colleagues had piled out and were hurrying toward him, weapons drawn.His relief was short lived.With a mixture of disbelief and horror he watched as the man and woman who were running to his aid went down.Held tight by multiple tiny hands, the wire that tripped them in the darkness and blowing sand was nearly invisible.Like the two chunks of crudely reworked sharpened metal sticking out of Xiaus left leg, the wire had been salvaged from one of the innumerable wrecks that littered the southern Namib.Gun in hand, the woman rolled over and got off one shot into the night before she was swarmed by several dozen furry shapes.At the same time, her companion was being assaulted by what appeared to be giant muscular mice.Trying to blink sand away from his eyes, Xiau looked on aghast.Some of the attackers wielded small knives and spears.Others stood off at a distance and puffed on one end of what looked like wooden straws.Each time one of the spine darts they fired struck the downed assassin she twitched.Unable to use her pistol at such close quarters, she set it aside and began striking and pulling at the chittering creatures that covered her body.But as fast as she could break a neck or throw one aside, others took their place.Meanwhile a handful of the attacking animals dashed in and, before she could react, picked up her sidearm and carried it off.Her larger male companion was having better luck.Having managed to struggle to his knees despite the swarm of biting, stabbing assailants clinging to his back and flanks, he was firing his napistol into the night.Packed with highly compressed napalm, each shell produced a geyser of orange flame where it struck.Small flaming shapes raced in all directions while the wind swept the acrid stink of burning fur and flesh through the air.Sinking their teeth into his right ear and wrenching back, two of the attackers tore it away from his head.Shrieking in anguish he rose and flailed madly at the side of his skull.Clinging to his wrist, another of the little monsters attacked the hand holding the wildly waving napistol and bit down hard on the trigger finger.Incredibly sharp teeth punched all the way to the bone.Instead of letting go of the gun, the mans finger contracted reflexively and the weapon fired again.Unfortunately for its pain crazed owner, the muzzle was pointing up and at him as his body reacted.The shell entered his open mouth and detonated.Opening like the petals of a red flower, a ball of expanding flame replaced his head.Chenwa appeared in the floaters doorway firing a pistol with one hand and snapping his maniped whip.The latter cut one meerkat on the ground in half as two others standing atop the dome of the parked transport dropped a third of their number onto the assassin below.Holding a foot long porcupine quill tightly in its front paws, the plunging meerkat drove it straight through Chenwas right eye.His lower jaw dropped along with his gun, the deadly whip limb went limp, and the contract killer slowly toppled forward onto the sand.Preparing to follow Chenwa outside, Volksmann had quickly changed his mind.Whatever had possessed these addled animal denizens of the Namib to wage war on his people he did not know.What he was certain of was that he wanted no more of it.All the approbation and monetary reward in the world were useless to someone lying dead in the desert.Making sure that Chenwas body was clear of the doorway, he touched a switch and watched as it cycled shut.Get us out of here!Isgard Fleurine, the twenty something professional executioner with the grandmotherly meld, stood facing the doorway holding two sidearms aimed in its direction.There was panic as well as determination in her voice.Volksmann needed no urging.Racing to the front of the transport he threw himself back into the pilots chair and ran anxious fingers over multiple controls.The floaters systems immediately came back online, the light from the various screens and readouts raising his spirits considerably.The absence of the drivers heads up didnt concern him.What mattered now was to get off the ground.Once the compact craft was in the air and hovering a safe three or four meters above the surface the maddened hordes of homicidal rodents, or whatever they were, would be reduced to impotent chattering.With the floaters automatic maintenance system having cleared the intakes of the bulk of ingested sand and grit, the transport rose smoothly to its maximum operating altitude of five meters.That was more than high enough for safety.Panting hard but beginning to breathe normally, Fleurine had holstered her weapons and was moving to join him.Safe from attack she leaned forward to peer down through the sweeping transparent front of the craft.Volksmann noted that the sandstorm was finally starting to abate.Four dead, he muttered.Murdered by indigenous rodents.Thatll go down well with the Yeoh.She put a reassuring hand on his shoulder and he reminded himself that this was a woman in her twenties who had only chosen to look eighty.A meld like that suggested a damaged personality, he knew.But then, both fit her job description.He was glad for the company.Unexpected death comes with the territory.You dont have to go into detail in your report, Meyer.Ill back you up.She wore a lopsided grin, simultaneously sensual and wolfish and greedy.Her eyes were not eighty.This way I get to collect payment for six, so dont expect any tears from me.Turning on the floaters landing beams Volksmann used them to search the ground off to his right.The earth there seemed to be moving, a veritable flowing pavement of brown and white bodies.Many of them were looking upward and throwing things in the direction of the transport.Spines, rocks, bits of metal: anything they could pick up.But their forelegs, while strong for their size, were short.Very little of the thrown material reached the floaters underside.The few bits of metal that did rise to the transports height made tiny pinging noises as they bounced off the tough composite body.Excitable little pointy nosed bastards, arent they?Moving away from the pilots seat the female assassin pulled the larger of her two sidearms and opened a port in the canopy.Not that Im into revenge or anythingits unprofessionalbut hang here while I roast a few dozen of them.Wouldnt want the rats to think they won anything.Volksmann licked his lips.Because of the storm weve been stuck here longer than I like.We need to pick up our quarry and start back before SICK security makes the changeover to the more active daylight shift.Sure, sure.I only need a couple minutes, mon pre.Leaning slightly out the port, the surviving member of his team started to take aim.I got a bunch of them huddling together.Just let me take them out and A snapping sound cracked above the dying wind.Volksmann didnt flinch at the sound of the gun going off.When he finally did turn to have a look he saw that it was not Fleurines weapon that had discharged.Turning, she gazed back at him with a blank look on her faux elderly maniped face.Her mouth was open and her expression one of surprise.When the blood from the hole in her forehead started to trickle into her eyes she blinked.Without speaking a word she fell forward onto the floor of the floater.A stunned Volksmann gaped at the petite form, then whipped around to peer out the windshield to his left.Light from the underside of the floater illuminated ground that was swarming with still more of the milling, chattering creatures.Many of them were pointing at the transport with tiny black paws.His searching eyes finally located the cluster that had been overlooked by the too eager Fleurine.He recognized a pistol that had belonged to Shakovsk, who had tried and failed to help Hideki and Xiau.Propped up on a rock, it was supported by a densely packed knot of the creatures who kept it balanced and steady.Its lethal barrel was aimed upward and straight at the hovering floater.A worn, chewed, but tough strip of old leather had been passed behind the trigger guard and looped over the trigger itself.Six of the creatures clung to each end of the strap, looking for all the world as if they were engaged in a serious tug of war.Standing on its hind legs well behind the gun and gazing up at the floater was a single representative of the species.For an impossible instant Volksmann had the absurd sensation that he was looking into the eyes of another intelligent being.Then he flinched back just as the gun went off again.The shot smashed through the windshield, missing him by centimeters.As he lurched to one side his right hand dragged across several controls.Responding to the anomalous mixture of inadvertent manual commands, the floater went into a wild slew to starboard.Before Volksmann could recover and countermand the accidental instructions, it had smashed into the ground.Dazed but conscious, he pulled himself upright in the pilots seat and began working the instrument console.The engine whined and the floater skewed sideways, but would not rise from the ground.Something had been seriously damaged in the crash.Preoccupied with stabbing and pressing at various controls, it took him several minutes before he grew aware of a new sound.It reminded him of the flying sand that had scoured the transport as it battled its way northward through the storm.But the noise that had begun to reverberate through the sides and roof of the floater was not coming from blowing sand.It arose from the rapid fire patter of hundreds of tiny feet.Whirling, he flung himself out of the pilots chair just as several dozen armed meerkats began scampering down the windshield in front of him.Utilizing their minuscule instruments of death they started scraping and stabbing at the transparency.To his relief he saw they were unable to so much as scratch the tough polycrylic.The hole that had been made by the second shot from the recovered pistol was not large enough to admit even the smallest of the attackers.He was safe inside the floater.At least, he was until he had to deal with SICK security, which would surely locate the downed craft as soon as the sun was up and the storm had fully subsided.There was water and emergency rations to sustain him.Not to mention his own weapons.He almost smiled.Unless his inexplicably organized assailants could muster enough strength to carry the floater off, he was safe.His biggest remaining concern, he realized, was how the hell he was going to explain this to SICKs people and to his superiors in the Triad.Even in times when extraordinarily magified animals were commonplace, what had befallen his expedition made no sense.Magified mammals were harmless.Maniped pets did not attack their masters.Bad human, piped an unmistakably small voice.A chill went down Volksmanns back, displacing the confidence that had braced him only a moment earlier.He turned.He had forgotten to close the port Fleurine had opened.There were at least a hundred of them inside now.Some rested on all fours.Others stood upright on their hind legs in disconcertingly humanlike poses.Dozens of bright black eyes were focused on the transports remaining occupant.Volksmann looked to his left.His personal sidearms lay in a compartment underneath the main instrument console.It would only take a matter of seconds for him to pull them out and start firing.But he did need those few seconds.Proffering a winning smile, he looked down at the furry creature who was standing slightly apart from the others.It was she who had voiced the two astonishingly clear words.He found it unsettling to hear himself talking back to the creature.This has all been a mistake.A stupid, regrettable mistake.Im sorry for what has happened, but somehow Ill make it right.I know that some of yourpeoplehave been hurt.But all my people are dead.Its all been a big misunderstanding.As he spoke he was leaning slowly to his left.His hand extended toward the compartment that contained the guns.Not allyour people, dead.The articulate meerkat spoke with a solemnity that belied her size.Is one people still alive.You.Well, yes, thats true.What do you propose to do?Volksmanns straining fingers were almost to the handle of the compartment.Pull, grab, and shoot.With so many of them crowded together he would not have to worry about taking aim.The meerkats voice never changed, never varied in volume or tenor.Rectify.Volksmanns fingers closed convulsively on the handle of the under console compartment and yanked.Before the concealed drawer had stopped sliding forward he was already reaching for the nearest of the pistols inside.Had he been facing others of his own kind he might have had a chance.But no human boasts reaction time as fast as a meerkat.Just as no one was around to hear the screams that issued from within the downed floater.In any event, they did not last for very long.The Sum of Her Parts     8 One of the nice things about a modern Gatling gun, Het Kruger reflected as he watched the familiar lonely terrain slip by beneath the company floater, was that they could be massaged to accept pretty much any type of projectile that would fit the muzzles.Traditional solid bullets, explosive shells, armor piercing roundsjust about anything that could be contained within the rotating barrels could be spat at an incredible rate of discharge toward a target.Take the floater in whose copilots seat he was presently sitting, drinking tea with his booted feet propped up on the instrument console.The two electrically powered amidships guns, one facing to port and the other to starboard, could spew explosive shells at thousands of rounds per minute, sufficient to disable or destroy anything short of the most heavily armored military hardware.To an outsider they would surely seem to constitute overkill for simple company securitywhich was precisely the point.Kruger called them his bouncersa hoary old term still used to refer to individuals charged with keeping order in bars and clubs.Be they Natural or Meld, the best men and women engaged in that ancient profession never raised a hand in anger.Their mere presence, or the firm delivery of an appropriate word or two, was usually enough to defuse a potentially unruly situation.Similarly, the sight of the floaters starboard and port multibarreled weapons was usually sufficient to convince even the most heavily armed intruders that they were seriously outgunned and that their best chance for survival lay in surrendering their arms.While on Krugers watch the heavy weaponry had only been fired once in anger.Two minutes after they had been unleashed, it was impossible to separate the bodies of the intruders from the floater in which they had been traveling.His own forensic specialist had taken one look at the mess and declared his inability to identify any of the remains.Instead of explosive shells, the single forward mounted Gatling fired darts filled with a powerful soporific.The contents of one or two was usually enough to put even a big lod Meld to sleep.If weapons had to be used Kruger much preferred this quieter and more humane method of taking down illegal visitors.For one thing, the chance to question live intruders provided information that could be added to the facilitys security bank.Names, places, facilitators, could all be stored for reference against future intrusions.For another, cleanup was infinitely easier and less time consuming.The particular intrusion he and his team were presently on their way to confront had been detected by the company satellite that stayed in synchronous orbit over the central and lower Namib.Able to complete a full high resolution scan of the region every several days, it was not perfect.But it did make it impossible for any vehicle bigger than a kids shufslide to remain in the area long enough to do any harm.It was theoretically possible for a well equipped intruder to get in fast and get out fast without being picked up by Nerens based security.If an intruder was willing to risk their life for some vit and a few pictures, Kruger could only admire them.That was real dedication and he did not concern himself with such transitory violations.It was those who came hoping to spend time in the Sperrgebeit that set the facilitys, and his, alarms to ringing.Most of them were after diamonds.Some came seeking rare animals they could sell on the black market.A thousand year old Welwitschia mirabilis was worth a great deal of subsist to wealthy plant collectors.While industrial espionage was also always a possibility, in his tenure as chief of security he had never encountered an interloper who had entered the Sperrgebeit with that in mind.Few outside the inner circle of the SAEC even knew there was a research and manufacturing facility at Nerens.Those who did had no reason to suspect that it was engaged in anything other than mining studies.Early morning in the Namib was beautiful no matter where one happened to find oneself, no matter which direction one looked, no matter what time of year it was.It helped to have an appreciation for the beauties of desert terrain.Not everyone could tolerate such a lack of greenery.Kruger loved the peacefulness and the solitude, the banded colors of the rocks, the way the wind coiffed the crests of the barchan dunes.The money.His work consisted mostly of running routine checkups of procedures and equipment that never went wrong.It was repetitive but satisfying.Another man might have been bored to death.Not Kruger.Having seen plenty of action in his youth he was more than content to enjoy what amounted to an exceptionally well paid semiretirement.True, at the facility he was occasionally exposed to sights and sounds that puzzled and confused him, but interpreting their meaning was not his job.Having survived being shot at for real, he knew that shooting other people while ducking fire was a scenario far better played out on a vit immersion than in real life.Bullets burned, getting hit hurt, and losing body parts even in a day and time when they could nearly always be replaced or substituted for was not nearly as exciting or invigorating as some of his younger and less experienced colleagues supposed.So he was gratified when word came from his scanner operator that there was no sign of movement at the location they were speeding to investigate.Dead quiet ahead, sir, the woman told him.With her right hand she slightly adjusted the perception helmet that covered her entire head.The three slender part flesh, part metal tentacles that emerged from her left shoulder were plugged deep and wirelike into the console in front of her.Nothing at all?Kruger spoke softly into the tiny vorec mike suspended in front of his mouth.Nothing, sir.Theres a floater there all right.Imaging people were right about that.Ive got it on reflective now.The silhouette is sharp enough for me to analyze the compositionbut nothings moving.No heat signature from the vehicle and nothing bipedal in the immediate vicinity.Itsquiet.Maybe theyre sleeping.The port side gunner stroked the back end of his weapon as if he were caressing a cat.If so theyre gonna get a nasty wake up call.Take it easy, Raki.Kruger recognized the tone.Like so many of his ilk the younger man was bored.Rotation was a problem in every department at Nerens, including Security.The isolation, the lack of things to do, the restrictions on individual movement both outside the facility and within, tended to result in rapid burnout among the personnel.Few stayed more than a year.Even fewer were on track to remain in their posts until their recruitment period was up.Among employees he was something of a dinosaur.Occasionally the strain of fulfilling an employment contract combined with the remoteness and desolation caused an employee to crack.Like that unfortunate Ouspel fellow, for example.As the floater turned due west he found himself wondering what had happened to the vanished employee.It was likely that he had fled on his own, propelled by his own personal psychosis.If so then he would have perished out in the vastness of the Sperrgebeit just like everyone else who tried to leave the facility without going through formal discharge procedures.Somewhere hyenas were gnawing the technicians bones.I have target on my screens, sir.The pilots limbs gently adjusted instrumentation and the security craft slowed.Orders?With a sigh Kruger sat up straight in his seat and pulled his legs off the console.Time to go to work.Sipho, where are you?The security chief knew he could have answered his own question simply by checking one readout on the console in front of him, but it was always good procedure to have verbal confirmation of your backups position.Coming around from the southeast, Het.The voice in the security chiefs earpiece was clear and devoid of distortion.ETA in approximately five minutes.You want us to go in or stand off?Stand off and stay airborne but move in close enough to establish visual.So far weve got nothing.I dont like dealing with nothing.It implies concealment.You think theyre waiting for us?Kruger considered.Theres no way they can know that their presence here has been discovered.I doubt theyre expecting company so soon after entering the Forbidden Zone.One of my gunners thinks they may be sleeping in.Its possible, especially if they had to ride out yesterdays sandstorm.That doesnt mean theyre not equipped with automatic alarms, or for that matter, automated weapons.Ill go in first, make the usual circuit, give them the usual warnings.Then well see.Minaqondagot it.The second armed company floater was just visible hovering on the eastern horizon as Krugers craft topped the last low rise and the target came into view.One did not need the security chiefs practiced eye to tell that something was wrong.The shredded bodies half buried in the sand were proof enough of that.Circle, he directed the pilot.Distant but within range.Gatlings powered up.Sobered by the sight of so many motionless human forms being slowly claimed by the desert, none of the floaters gunners cracked wise.They kept their hands on their triggers, the electrically powered weapons ready to run riot at the touch of a switch.Ive got nothing moving, sir.The scanner operators fingers and tentacle tips efficiently worked her console.No heat signatures, either.Individual reads are cold.Might be somebody alive inside and shielded.Kruger was thinking out loud.Given the presence of so many dead on the ground outside the downed craft it seemed unlikely anyone had survived within, but one of the hallmarks of his administration of security at Nerens was that he was always ready for the unlikely.Close pass, he ordered tersely.The floater pilot performed a second circumnavigation of the silent transport.The scanners follow up report was as void of life as its predecessor.As the security craft gradually orbited in closer and closer to the crash site, Kruger was able to make out details without the aid of supplementary lenses: the hole in the vehicles windshield, the open port, and the main doorway gaping wide.From the spray of sprawled corpses that fanned out like palm leaves from the vicinity of the portal he could tell that those inside the downward craft had managed to get out.The question that nagged at him was what, if anything, had managed to get in?He was close enough now to be able to see where weapons had been dropped beside bodies.What had happened here?Had the intruders fallen to arguing among themselves, with fatal results?His interest was purely personal.From a professional standpoint the intrusion had conveniently resolved itself.Find a level spot and set down near the intruders front end, he told his pilot.Raki, you stay at your gun.The rest of you make sure your sidearms are charged and loaded and get ready to disembark.He directed his last words to a console pickup.Sipho, move in close but stay aloft.Nothing challenged him or his subordinates as they raced quickly down the ramp that the pilot deployed from the side of the company floater.Outside the armored transport the air was utterly motionless.A common enough atmospheric condition in the Namib, and one that was especially appropriate given the grisly scene that was spread out before the wary security personnel.Standing in dead air Kruger slowly took stock.It seemed as if the carnage had even intimidated the wind.Naturals and Melds, men and women alike had been felled by unknown adversaries.The identity of the latter soon became apparent.Spreading out to count the bodies, Kruger and his team came across a number of far smaller corpses scattered among the deceased humans.Broken, smashed, half incinerated, several of the deceased meerkats still carried quivers of poison tipped spines on their backs or clutched weapons improvised from bone and scavenged, coarsely reworked metal and plastic.As if the presence of their embattled dead was not proof enough, the ground was covered with thousands of tiny footprints.A shuffling Maranon joined the security chief as Kruger nudged a huddle of dead meerkats with his right foot.There were half a dozen of the small twisted bodies in the pile.They looked as if they had met their end at the same time, cooked with a single shot.A practitioner of Brazilian mechcandombl, Maranon was visibly uncomfortable in the presence of so many unexplained undersized fatalities.Dead humans, Natural or Meld and in any number, did not trouble him.Armed meerkats were something outside his experience, and it showed in his voice and expression.What the hell, Mr.Kruger, sir?I mean, what the hell?As a scientific explanation of the lethal biological anomaly that was spread out before them, the subordinates observation left much to be desired.Viscerally, however, Kruger found himself in complete accord with the other mans remark.Raising his gaze he began to scan the surrounding landscape, searching for any sign of movement.Especially small mammalian movement.This is unusual, he commented with characteristic understatement.Decidedly out of the ordinary.There will have to be a report.Lifting his wrist, he spoke into the communicator that was strapped to his lower forearm.Sipho, weve got a real anomaly here.Remnants of a massacre the likes of which you wont believe.Set down and deploy your people in a defensive perimeter around the site.Tell them totell them to keep an eye out for meerkats.Incredulity was prominent in the other mans reply.Meerkatssir?Yebo, meerkats.Someone, somewhere, has been engaged in some extreme magifying.At least we wont have to deal with the intruders.Theyve already been dealt with.Dealt with, sir?came the other mans voice.By whom, sir?Kruger hesitated a moment.By the natives.And not the ones youre thinking of.As soon as you set down come on over and youll see for yourself.Lowering his arm and breaking the connection Kruger resumed hiking away from the downed floater.Several of the dead humans had so many Codon spines sticking out of their bodies that they looked like desert succulents themselves.One still clutched her pistol in a death grip while the rest lay weaponless.Either they had panicked and abandoned their floater while it was under attack and the rest of the intruders guns lay inside, or else someone had carried their weapons away.Could a meerkat aim and fire a weapon designed to be utilized by a human?Kruger pondered the possibility.Even a small gun would be too big, too heavy, too clumsy.But several agile meerkats working in tandem, now Having not enjoyed a single comforting thought since setting down in this haunted place he looked forward to returning to the comfort of his apartment and office back in Nerens.At least his report would be able to include a full description of the intruders.Though individually they were a flutter of aliases, there was more than enough information in their floater computer to mark them as operating on behalf of the Yeoh Triad out of Guangzhou.What the Triad was looking for in the Sperrgebeit, Kruger had no idea.Maybe someone had given them a line on a diamond deposit and this team had been sent to check it out.That made sense, the security chief told himself.If they had entered the Forbidden Zone only to validate information and then leave, they could reasonably assume they would be able to do so before he and his people had time to respond to their intrusion.The lack of any mining gear on the downed floater lent further credence to such a theory.Of course their incursion might have nothing to do with diamonds or mining.Since he had been deprived of anyone to interrogate, their true motive remained open to speculation.That was now a matter for SICK intelligence, not him.He made sure that his personnel recorded everything as they wandered among the sandy killing field.Otherwise no one back at the facility was going to believe them.Murderous meerkatsoh, certainly!That Het Krugerwhat a joker!But it was no joke.There was nothing funny about a septet of corpses.He found himself wondering if the encounter that had taken place here represented an isolated incident or was a precursor to a brand new security issue.He would have to find out what poisons were effective on meerkats.Or had these heavily maniped specimens been magified to the point where they knew enough to recognize and ignore baited traps?All matters for speculation, he told himself as he turned back toward his waiting floater.The ethics of animal magifying, the how much and what kind, had long been hotly debated.Its practical aspects were less frequently addressed.Here was a perfect example of how such biological manipulation could get out of hand.In the old days security at the facility had just been a matter of dealing with invasive species.Now people were developing their own invasive species in labs and illegal manip centers.It had been stated with confidence by the appropriate international regulatory bodies that the Ciudad Simiano in Central America represented the end of such thoughtless research and experimentation.His expression twisted.He would have liked to have been able to show some of those self satisfied, overconfident politicians around this particular patch of the Namib.Meerkats were smart, social, and adaptable.So were rats, who were even more adaptable and far more procreative.The weapons on their broken little bodies proved that the meerkats who had done battle with the intruders had been given at least a minimal intelligence boost.What if some deranged biosurge or gengineer somewhere decided to do the same for a few rats?He shook his head at the shortsightedness of it all.You couldnt stop the magifying of animals.Too many people wanted their special pets.There was far too much money to be made in the underground market, selling yodeling lemurs and cooing cats and dogs who could speak a few programmed phrases.Greed would always outweigh danger.The Sperrgebeit was proof enough of that.Aware that Maranon was shadowing him, he turned abruptly.Are you following me, mister?Im watching your back, Mr.Kruger, sir.The other man spoke with deference as he shifted his rifle from one arm to the other.A small smile played across the security chiefs face.No, theres more to it than that.Youre afraid, arent you?If Kruger expected a sputtering denial it was not forthcoming.Yes sir, Im afraid.The Naturals eyes darted nervously over the surrounding silent terrain.These meerkat creatures arent normal.They live in burrows, in tunnels.They could be anywhere, even right under our feet right now, waiting for the right moment.Waiting for us to relax so they can pop up and fill our legs with toxic darts.Well then, you can stop worrying, Maranon.Ive seen enough here and weve recorded enough to prove to the others back at the facility that were not liars.Analyzing and trying to make sense of what happened here is a job for the bio boys, not us.Were pulling out.He clapped the other man on the shoulder.Go on, get back to the transport.And for pitys sake, quit worrying about cousin mongoose.I havent seen anything alive bigger than a bug since we got here.However they did this, or why, any killer weasels are long gone.Yes, sir.Thank you, sir.Maranon smiled and nodded, grateful that his boss had chosen not to demean him.After he gave the general order for departure Kruger waited while the rest of his team pulled back to the two waiting floaters.Alone once more on the desert floor he took the time to stroll slowly around the perimeter of the confrontation.Aware that the members of his team would be watching and monitoring his progress from inside the two floaters, he knew it would bolster their spirits to see their commanding officer making a final inspection of the impossible battlefield without any immediate backup.It should settle a few nerves.That was his job, too.Satisfied that there was nothing more to be learned unless he left a detachment behind to conduct a more in depth study, he broke into a jog toward his floater.An explanation for what had taken place here would be forthcoming in its own good time.He looked forward to it.Unlike many of his subordinates he did not make jokes about the desert.He had a healthy respect for its vast empty spaces and the many secrets it doubtless still contained.Much as he would have liked to know exactly what had transpired in this place he felt no need to rush to judgment.Sometimes it was best not to pursue things in the Namib too closely or in too much haste lest a camouflaged sand cobra jump up to bite you in the ass.Climbing back into the transport he gave the order for both crafts to lift off and return to Nerens.Settling himself in one of the seats in the back he helped himself to a cold Tusker and reflected on the mornings work.Though he was returning with a mystery in tow, at least he could assure his superiors of one thing.The trespassers had been dealt with down to the last Meld and no other intruders were left alive in this sector.The Sum of Her Parts     9 Despite her unease, despite her fears, and despite the steady, unrelenting howl of the storm and the particles of wind borne grit that assaulted her face like a thousand tiny biting gnats, Ingrid Seastrom had fallen asleep.Exhaustion is ever the tortoise to the hares pain.She woke up choking on sand.Spitting and wiping at her mouth, she sat up and found herself staring at a sky of such untrammeled Prussian blue that it seemed a glaze on the ceramic bowl of heaven.In that perfect toned firmament nothing moved: not a breath of cloud, not a stirring of wind, not a whisper of wings.Speaking of Whispr While she brushed sand off her legs she looked to her right, then to her left.Twisting her tired body, she looked behind her.No Whispr.Only eastern mountains and western plains, rills and runs and rips in the rocks that were millions of years old.Her heart started to beat fasterand in the complete and total silence she felt she could hear it.What if he had decided he would be better off on his own and had taken off while shed slept?What if he had finally surrendered to his nagging paranoia and decided to return to Orangemund and thence home?He had the only functioning communicator.On the communicator was the only copy of Morgan Ouspels instructions on how to get to Nerensand how to return safely to the Orange River.If he had abandoned her then she would have time enough only to contemplate her own imminent demise.But he wouldnt do that to herwould he?Not to the doctor who had removed the police traktacs from his back.Not to his partner in exploration.Not to the woman he childishly and transparently wanted to possess.Not to Ingrid Seastrom, M. D. , beloved of all her patients and There was no point in shouting her frustration because there was no one to hear her.Standing up allowed her to take in a good deal more of the barren landscape.Squinting against the harsh sun she located more mountains, more scattered brush, more dunes and cracked gravel pans.But no Whispr.No companion.No other motile living thing.Which way to go?Which way to run?Orangemund lay far to the south now.She might be able to remember the way back, might be able to retrace her steps.But shorn of specific directions she was unlikely to make it.Nerens was nearer now and she knew its general direction, but without Ouspels map and details she might stumble right past it.Even if she found the place she would not exactly be assured of a hearty welcome.To the east lay the Kalahari, to the west the undrinkable Atlantic.She had no choice.Grim and resigned, she started off in a northwesterly direction.A dozen steps and as many silent curses later she tripped over her companion.Except for his sideways turned face he lay completely buried in the sand.His pack lay nearby.Whether he had dropped it, set it down, or flung it away in a fit of madness she had no way of knowing.It lay open to the elements, its precious contents scattered by the wind.Carefully she brushed sand from his cheek and neck.Then she smacked him on the upturned side of his face hard enough to make her palm sting.He sat up so fast that she had to backpedal quickly to avoid being knocked down.Whahuh?Ill give you wah huh you pathetic, insensitive bastard!I thought youd run out on me!I thought youd left me here to die in the desert while you bone scooted your miserable scrawny ass back to Orangemund!I thought !Aw, you missed me, he cooed, interrupting her tirade.She was ready to continue, stopped, stared at him a moment, then looked away.I felt so alone I wouldve missed a pustulant iguana.I was scared.Okay, okay.Im here.Wish I were elsewhere, maybe, but still here.You can relax now knowing that you wont die alone and that youll have company when you do so.Sorry if that doesnt make me feel any better.Her heart rate slowing, she looked down at him.What happened?Whyd you move?Her expression contorted.Usually when we turn in for the night you cant get close enough and I have to kick you away.Busy shedding the rest of the diminutive dune that had accumulated atop his body, he didnt meet her eyes.I thought maybe if I sat upwind of you with my back to the storm I could keep some of the blowing sand off your body, help you to get some sleep.I think that I did.Then I fell asleep.And fell over.I dont remember passing out, either, she muttered.Fatigue will do that to a person.Unfortunately, he added as he turned and pointed, I made the mistake of putting my pack next to me.I shouldve put it under me, or at least remembered to secure all the straps and seals.I didnt think the wind would be strong enough to move it, much less pick it up and dump it somewhere else.Together they walked over to where his pack had stopped.Some of the food was missing.The wind had probably carried it halfway to the Makgadikgadi by now, she thought regretfully.Fortunately all of the special supplements required to keep Whisprs melded digestive system functioning properly remained.Between the two of them they had enough packaged nutrients to keep going for at least another few days.His waterpak was still in working order.And though the force of the wind had sucked it outside the backpack, they found his first aid kit lying nearby, intact and still sealed against the weather.Their relief at recovering so much food and drink turned to despair when they finally located his communicator.Wind driven grit had penetrated the protective housing.No matter what command he tried to enter and irrespective of the contacts he touched, the small screen remained blank and the integrated tridee projector would not light.Nor did the battered device respond to verbal command.Can you fix it?She stared hopefully at the compact glassine rectangle.His laugh was as bitter and sardonic as any she had heard issue from his willowy throat.I suppose I should be flattered that you think enough of me to even ask that question, doc.Much as Id like to say yes, you got me wrong.I just steal these things.He brandished it at her.I dont fix em.A wave took in the distant mountains.Its no problem, though.Well just amble over to the nearest shop and buy a replacement.Thats what sustains me through all this, she growled back at him.Your mordant wit.He started to bark a rejoinder, then unexpectedly broke into one of his irritatingly ingratiating grins.Being angrys healthier than being scared.Go ahead and bitch at me all you want.I can take it.Im used to being a punching bag.She sighed and shook her head.Why cant you just stick to one psychological statesarcastic or pitiable?
