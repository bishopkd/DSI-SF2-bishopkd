His troops were spread out in three man groups along the top of the canyon, and his own was the furthest south.Lisa Albright was a couple meters away with her rifle held across her chest.Stories of her exploits on the Gaza Strip spread quickly after their return, and shed become a minor celebrity.As far as anyone knew, she was the only person to kill a rhino in hand to hand.Of course, rumors grew and twisted as they spread, and half the resistance now thought shed faced the beast in single combat and snapped its neck with her bare hands.That was just the way rumors worked, Jack supposed.She wore a dark red beret that someone gave her, and with her camouflage painted face, she looked less like a physician every day and more like a very tiny commando.There were stories about Jack, too, but nothing like Albrights tall tales.The brass were talking about his quick thinking and ability to stay cool under pressure, and in an organization starved for leadership, a lot of eyes were on him all of a sudden.His only option was to pick up the ball and run with it.The resistance had scored a few small victories over the previous weeks, minor annoyances at best, but Jack thought it time to start really pissing the invaders off.He wasnt content to skulk around the night setting booby traps.He wanted to do something bold and noisy.Something the enemy couldnt ignore.The Bravos, whose ranks had swollen to a few dozen soldiers, hid along the canyon for three days straight.They watched the alien walkers sprint through at two hundred KPH, and they figured out a rough schedule.Around noon, single walkers tended to come through every forty two minutes, and there were never any security sweeps or air support.The enemy considered this a safe region.Whaddya think, hero?Today the day?Albright asked.He nodded.Well hit the next one that comes through.Good, she said.Im tired of this shit hole.Charlie Hernandez came bounding up the slope a moment later.Most of his black, bug like armor was hidden under overlapping pieces of ragged cloth, and he looked like some kind of vagrant grasshopper.The higher ups wanted someone to observe and report back on the viability of Jacks tactic.Charlie was between posts at the time and quickly volunteered.The chain is set and ready to go.The forward teams just waiting for a target, he said in his mechanically altered voice.What about Trashs group?Locked and loaded.There was nothing left to do but take cover and wait.Twenty minutes later, they spotted a dust cloud at the northern end of the canyon.Jack raised his binoculars up, and could see the alien walker galloping in at full speed.Here she comes, he said.From his vantage point, he could hardly see the forward teams position five hundred meters on, and he couldnt see the chain at all.Thats how it was supposed to be.Then, just as the walker was about to pass the forward team, the thick metal chain snapped taught eight meters above the ground.The walker saw it at the last moment and tried to stop, but it was too late.Its forward legs buckled and snapped, and the vehicle lurched forward, tumbling end over end through the narrow canyon, and then skidded along the rocky soil.It ground to a halt amid a thick cloud of kicked up dust right under Jacks position.Trashs team immediately went into action.Fire one!Trash hollered, and a rocket propelled grenade raced down from out of the rocks with a hiss, followed by a trail of white smoke.The shot struck the back of the walkers body and exploded in a ball of fire and debris.All clear!It was time for Jacks team to move.He, Charlie and Albright rushed down the side of the canyon, interspersing quick hops with controlled slides through the loose soil.By the time they came to the bottom, the smoke had cleared and the walker lay face first in the dirt with its blasted ass in the air, broken and twitching, a massive singed hole where its back end used to be.Chase and Trash came down the opposite side, and stopped behind a rock above the walker.They had their rifles trained on the wreckage.Got yer back, chief!Jack team moved.His team clambered up the side of the vehicle and swept their barrels across the opening, ready to take down anything still moving.There was no motion inside the vehicle, only strangely colored blood and carnage.Sweep through and put a round in every skull.No survivors.Charlie, you documenting this?Recording as we speak, Charlie said.Well have plenty of footage.Good.Albright, pick out two good specimens of each kind.Roger that, she said.The creatures were strapped to the walls with tendril like harnesses, much like the inside of a leviathan, actually.Jack quickly pushed the thought out of his head before he had a chance to feel anything approaching sympathy.The three soldiers moved through row by row, and finished each occupant with a single round to the head.It was mechanical work, and they did it quickly and without passion.Jack, take a look at this, Albright said from the front of the cabin.He strode over to meet her, and found her standing before a creature they hadnt seen before.Its flesh was shiny and off white, like uncooked scallop meat.It was thin and spindly, with no apparent bone structure.It had six arms, a finned tail, and a bulb of a head with thin mouth and a single, off center blue green eye.It sat in some kind of cradle, with its arms hooked into burrows in the walkers flesh.It was alive, but badly wounded.It mewled in pain and fear.Must be the pilot, Albright said.Jack nodded.He thought back to the first village back in China, and remembered the floating, six armed creature that directed the operations there.It shape was right, but all of the details were different.Sounds about right.I think they wear some kind of armor when they go outside.The thing was twitching uncontrollably, and whenever it jerked, the ruined walker quaked.It looked up at Jack with pleading in its giant eye, and it whimpered.Jack had his forty five in hand the whole time.He raised the weapon to the creatures head and pulled the trigger, splashing grey and green on the wall behind.The creature was silent.Youre a cold son of a bitch, Jack.You should talk, he said.If you can get it out of the cradle, take this one too.Yes, sir.Jack heard the rumble of their troop transport outside.The forward team packed up faster than expected.That was good news.They needed to get out before the next walker came.In silence, Jack and his team carried the alien corpses out, loaded them into the transport, and left for Al Saif.They left the broken walker out in the open, where it would be found a half hour later.Jack hoped the message was clear.Chapter 30:  Dissect  Jack wasnt quite thirty and hed already seen thousands of open wounds.He became numb to the sight of blood and gore, but that hadnt always been the case.No, back when he first joined the Corps, he thought he was a real tough guy, but all the bravado flushed away when he came upon the remains of someone blown apart by a roadside bomb.The air was thick and smelled like a slaughterhouse, but he didnt immediately put it together.Not until he saw parts he recognized.A hand.A leg sheared off below the knee.Intestines spilling over a curb.Then the floodgates opened and realization rushed into him all at once.The smell was human meat.Jack ran away and puked his guts out, and was grim and despondent for days afterward.Thats when he first met Leonid Nikitin, another young corpsman who already had a year of duty behind him.Nikitin had enough sense to take Jack out for a beer and listen while the young corpsman came to grips with what he was feeling.He didnt say a word all night, not until Jack was done, and then all he said was, Its good that youre disgusted, Jackie boy.You better be, because its a damn disgusting world out there.Thats why were here, aint it?Because were disgusted.Because we care enough to try and make things right.Need another beer?That was enough to help Jack pull through.He had a pounding headache the next morning, but when that passed, he was alright.Really alright.He got up, he did his job, and a handful of years later, he became head of his brigade.That was eight years past, but Jack still thought about it sometimes.As he stepped down into the darkened shelter that had been converted into a ramshackle morgue, the smell brought the memory back again like a freight train.For a moment, Jack thought he was going to lose his lunch, but he metered his breathing and concentrated until the nausea passed.It took him a little while to adjust to the light.The center of the room was sharply lit by a single overhead lamp, and everything beyond that faded to blackness.Something sat on a raised platform, attended by someone in a white coat.A moment later, Jack recognized Lisa Albright, who looked temporarily like a doctor again.She was busy dissecting and documenting the aliens, while Charlie stood off to the side, manning a camcorder.Albright had protested that she wasnt trained for this kind of work, but she was the best they had, and the bodies were already starting to decompose.Without refrigeration, they wouldnt get half way to the Russian Ark without falling apart.Jack could make out more detail in the room.The thing on the table was one of the half tonne rhinos, all of its limbs stretched out and its chest cavity split open.The thick, elephantine skin was pinned to the sides, revealing amorphous discolored organs.Several parts had already been removed and were sitting in shallow metal dishes.He approached the platform and looked down at the lifeless creature with disdain.Youre having fun, I see.What am I looking at here?I havent identified everything yet, but most of its more like us than not.Heart, liver, stomach, lungs.She pointed them out as she went, some still inside the corpse and others arrayed around the table.A la carte.Its all there in one form or another.Learn anything useful?Not yet, but a couple interesting things for sure.For one, they dont wear the armor.Its attached to them.Grows right out of the skin.Weird.And the bugs on their backs?Some kind of symbiotic relationship.The rhino has a secondary dorsal breathing tube, like a whales blowhole, and the insect is attached there.It has a snorkel organ that extends right down into the hole, and branches into the rhinos lungs.If I had to guess, Id say they have complimentary respiratory chemistries.The armor grew around the insects hooks, so its probably been attached for a while.She walked around the platform and pointed at the creatures crotch.Theres something else.The sex organs are horribly atrophied, probably vestigial.His gonads are about the size of rice grains.I cant imagine it being able to breed at all, which seems to imply some sort of caste system.Interesting.Have you dissected the bug yet?Not yet, but I dont expect Ill learn much when I do.You could fill a library with everything I dont know about insect physiology.Ive already finished the jackrabbit and the pilot, though.And?Weird and weirder.The jackrabbits are all over the place.Their eyes are highly developed, with tapetum lucidum and full nictitating membrane.Their eyes also have multiple lenses, lined up in a series.I think.Ive never seen anything like it before.Come again?I dont speak Latin.Good night vision, can probably see farther than us.Maybe telescopically.Gotcha.Are the rabbits fixed, too?Nope.The specimen we brought back is female, with fully formed ovaries and what appears to be a marsupial pouch.Jack chuckled.Maybe we should start calling em kangaroos, then?Nah.The huge eyes and floppy ears are more iconic.True.As for the pilot well, theres just nothing like it on Earth.Or wasnt, anyway.Its kind of like someone yanked out some animals nervous system and made it its own creature.Its mostly high density nerve bundles connected to a big fat brain, with a lidless, bioluminescent eye.Judging by the brain to body mass ratio, I wouldnt want to play chess against him.I hate chess.Me too, Charlie chimed in.Albright chewed on her lower lip.The thing thats bothering me the most is that none of these things appear to be even remotely related.Its like us teaming up with pigeons and crabs.I just dont get it.Jack was still staring at the half dismantled corpse.Im all for academic advancement and shit, and Im sure this is all really interesting, but all I want to know is how to kill them.Tell me you found a weak spot.Albright shook her head.Sorry, Jack.No silver bullets.They live just like us, though.They eat, they breathe.They bleed, Charlie added.Then well just keep killing em any way we can.Chapter 31:  Dreaming in Color  Sal traveled back and forth between Mars and Legacy constantly during the construction of the second factory, and by the time the new complex finally sparked to life, shed completely moved aboard Legacy.With every trip, she brought more tools, scraps and pieces of junk, until her workshop on the great alien vessel was a perfect recreation of the one she abandoned on the Arcadian Plain.The furniture, lighting and even gravity were all the same.She even rigged up a device to imitate the sound of small stones hitting the colony shielding; the noise had irritated her to tears on Mars, but much to her surprise, its absence bothered her even more.The difference was that with a single thought, her new workshops walls could turn clear as glass, revealing the bustling factory beyond.It was hers now, and was churning out equipment at a startling rate.It had become her pride and joy.The factory certainly wasnt the only source of activity on Legacy.The rest of it was in a constant state of change as the ship and its crew adapted to one another.Legacy grew terminals that mimicked human computers, which went a long way toward improving communications with her new inhabitants.The terminals werent perfect, and the ships grasp of language especially could be puzzling, but they were a start.Engineering posed its own challenges.The original Eireki occupants had been in continual psychic contact with one another, which made their thoughts more orderly and fine tuned.They werent just people; they were something more, capable of doing complex mathematics and spatial transformations in their collective consciousness.To run the factory, they simply dreamed up new devices to the last exacting detail and the machinery turned the dreams into reality.Sal was supposedly more like the Eireki than the otherswhatever that meantbut she just didnt have the mental brawn necessary to drive construction that way.On a few occasions, the machines managed to produce small baubles she pictured in her minds eye, but she was scribbling on the wall with crayons when they needed the Sistine Chapel.This left her in a lurch.The factory could dissect and reproduce her machined parts, but couldnt fabricate things like microchips.It could produce a variety of standard Eireki components, but most of it left Sal utterly baffled.She needed to integrate the two somehow, but it just wasnt coming to her.She briefly considered volunteering for a freaky brain interface like Donovans, but she couldnt stomach the idea, and it would only go part of the way to solving her problems anyway.While it would aid in back and forth communication, it wouldnt make her any smarter.She was plenty sharp with numbers, but was no Eireki savant.What she needed was a way to plug her workstation into the ship.Shed been using modeling and simulation software for years, and considered the machine her better half, but trying to get it and Legacy to talk was impossible.At first glance, the problem was similar to designing the MASPECs interface, but her work there relied on decades of other peoples research into biofeedback and human nerve conductivity.The building blocks had all been known quantities; she simply stacked them correctly, with a smidgen of elbow grease and patchwork.Her current problem was a mirror image.She was trying to reverse engineer an alien nervous system, and build a translation layer on top of it.The task was miles outside of her expertise.She had to find some way to bridge the gap between her digital tech and whatever the heck Legacy used, or construction would be permanently stuck in a rut.Sal toyed around with a computer aided design program on her workstation.A three dimensional model hovered and spun around in an endless sea of grey.She wasnt working on anything in particular.It was just something to keep her hands busy while her brain assaulted the interface problem.Then she heard the whoosh of the transit tube, followed by a pair of boots clacking on the floor.She found the prospect of company dreadful, and didnt bother to look up.Hopefully, whoever it was would take a hint.The person stopped behind her chair.That design looks interesting.Let me guess A planetary probe?It was Marcus Donovan.Close.Ive been thinking about the people on Earth.They have no idea were out here.They dont know help is on its way, and I thought maybe we could give them a little hope.Youre planning some kind of two way communication, I presume?Depends on if I can figure out Legacys comm technology or not.If not, then we can at least send a message in a bottle.Pack in some orbital photos and a note letting them know were building a fleet.Maps are good, but leave it at that.I dont want the enemy to know were out here until its too late.Until were knocking at their door.Your plan is clever, though.Thanks and all, she said.But Im not clever enough to communicate the design to the factory.Its nothing but wasted pixels.Thats actually why Im here, Donovan said.He had that seductive tone in his voice again, like the devil about to offer a deal.Rao and I discovered something we think might help.Discovered something?Sal doubted anything less than a hidden network port would be of much use.She turned and looked at Donovan with skepticism in her eyes.Well, whaddya got?Thatd be telling.Just go to the transit tube, and youll see.Sal considered not going to spite Donovan and his stage magician theatrics, but if he had an answer, she needed to see it.Fine, she said, lead the way.Ladies first, he said.She smiled despite herself.Chivalry was a dying art form, especially on Mars.She stood and walked to the landing pad.The artificial gravity lifted her into the air sucked her into the tube.She couldnt escape the feeling Legacys transit was a bit like being flushed down an impossibly large toilet, and she didnt know if that was hilarious or terrifying.Probably a little bit of both.The tubes passed by in a blur, and then she was lowered down inside a large, dome shaped white room.There were evenly spaced concentric rings in the floor, each of them a channel full of what appeared to be water, but faintly glowing a rich sea blue.Donovan arrived a second later, and strode out across the floor.He beckoned Sal on with a curled finger.Weve been trying to figure out the purpose of this room since we arrived.As usual, everyone had a theory, but most resembled Professor Caldwells, who was absolutely sure it was some kind of temple.He was really keyed into the perfect circles, and the possibility of a pseudo Pythagorean geometry cult, or some such.Doesnt seem like a bad theory.No, not bad.Except that it was completely wrong.Donovan waved his hand and the lights dimmed.The man really had a thing for stage theatrics.Of course, thats just the way Caldwell is.All symbolism and nothing practical.If he dug up an ancient wrench, hed spin a theory about it being an abstract lunar sculpture used by moon worshiping priests to summon the seasons.So whyd you bring him along?Donovan had a sheepish smile.Because Im the kind to dig up a lunar sculpture and assume its a wrench.Sensible decision.Alright then, Mr.Smarty Pants, what is this place then?Simple.Its a projection room.There was a slight disturbance in the gravity, a tiny readjustment.Then the fluid in the channels began to rise into the air in streams that dissipated to a thin vapor a half meter later.The fluid is doped with micro organisms that fluoresce when excited.Stars and nebulae appeared all around, swirling in the humid air.Donovan floated up from the floor and swam through his new galaxy, and as he pointed to the different stars, each burned more brightly.Even better, its fully interactive.With those words, a literal handful of stars swarmed above his open palm and circled like fireflies.Whoa, was all she said.Precisely what I said when I first saw it.Give it a try.Sal closed her eyes and tried to summon absolutely anything to mind, but drew a blank.This new development was just too startling, the possibilities too open.Her heart was racing.Finally, something simple came to her and she imagined it as clearly as she could.When she opened her eyes, Donovans stars were gone, replaced by a reasonable imitation of the table in her workshop.The shape was a little wonky, but it was there.Hmmmm, Donovan said.I expected a little more on your first try.How about your message in a bottle?He pushed the holographic table out of the way and it splashed out of existence like waves breaking over rocks.Then he began sketching out her device in the air.As his fingers moved, a glimmering light trailed them and the object quickly took shape.Whoa, she said again.Yeah, I said that too.Thats all wrong, she said after a moment, and floated up into the air.When she reached Donovan, she instinctively started pushing and pulling at the image, and it reacted like clay.Her hands raced around, adding flanges and control surfaces, and soon it closely resembled the model on her computer screen back in the lab.So, you see how this might be useful.Im beginning to.Theres more, he said.He was deep in thought for a second, and then a perfect replica of one of the tugs appeared in the middle of the room.The small utility ship began to disassemble itself, piece by piece.When the drive section came off, it swelled to several times its original size, became partially transparent, and the major components each turned different colors.Legacys been analyzing her own technology to figure out how it works, and she remembers more from her past everyday.In here, she can show you what shes learned.Sal didnt waste any time.She flew a couple meters away into still empty air, and started sculpting something in light.She wasnt sure what it was just yet, but she continued to play with the object until it took shape.A car?Donovan asked.I guess, she said, and added a set of wheels.Just messing around.Getting a feel for this.Donovan had an extremely goofy grin on his face.And the engineer becomes a painter again.Should I bring your equipment?Not necessary.Ill get it myself in a bit.As you wish, he said, and he headed for the transit tube.If you need anything, just call.I will, Sal said, but she wouldnt.She was already on her second object, pulling its edges around like salt water taffy.For the first time in months, she was having fun.It was effortless and addictive.So much that she wouldnt leave the room at all for more than a day.Chapter 32:  Forward  Al Saif was abuzz with activity.Everyone had heard there was big news, and rumors ran rampant throughout the base.More information was promised at the general meeting, but in the meantime, imaginations flared up.Each time Jack turned a corner, he found another gaggle of soldiers gossiping about what theyd heard.Theories were all over the map.He heard one man claiming the invaders had abandoned South America for unknown reasons, and ten minutes later, he heard another excitedly describing a mysterious remnant naval fleet assembled off the coast of Antarctica.Those were just the plausible stories.The implausible ones were even more extravagant, like armies of genetically engineered subterranean supermen rising up in Germany, or captured alien warships in space.He eagerly awaited news of knights in magical armor riding man eating unicorns.Evening came, and Jack was in the mess tent, seated across from Leonid Nikitin, whod just returned to active duty.The human lighthouse viciously attacked pile after pile of food, as if he hadnt eaten in weeks.He was a bit thinner from bed rest and covered in new scars, but hardly worse for wear.In fact, the jagged scar along his jawline fit him perfectly.Albright sat quietly next to Jack, sipping from her canteen and otherwise off in her own little world.Even before the invasion, shed been prone to bouts of deep thought.Jack figured hed do the same if he knew even a quarter as much as stuff.How about this one?Nikitin said with his mouth jammed full of dry rations.I heard the aliens started fighting each other, like a civil war or something.Jack looked skeptical.Come on, Nik.You can do better than that.And theyre cannibals?Now youre getting somewhere.Cannibal zombies.Too far.Nikitin laughed hard, and bits of food flew out of his mouth.Alright, alright.Whatve you got?Ummm I heard that after years of careful planning, the one thing the aliens didnt account for was disease, and now theyre dropping like flies.Weak.Do you honestly think no one else has seen War of the Worlds?Wait for it.Sexually transmitted disease.Ha!I can see the headlines now Alien Armada Defeated by the Clap!Invasion forces penetrated deep, but shouldve used protection, Jack added with a laugh.He refused to say it, but he was glad as all hell to have Nikitin back.The guy laughed in deaths face as a matter of habit, and his spirit was contagious.He was a walking morale booster, and without him, Jack could get too grim for even his own taste.So seriously, what do you think this is all about?Jack shook his head.Not even gonna try guessing, man.He glanced down at his watch and 7:00pm was fast approaching.But well find out soon enough.They spouted off another half dozen joke theories while they finished eating, and then all three headed off to the shabby meeting hall where Colonel Galili had spoken that first night.It was standing room only, and the excitement inside was so thick Jack could cut it with a spoon.As was the stink of sweat.Jack, Nikitin and Albright pushed and jostled their way through the crowd, and stopped only when they couldnt wade any further in.A fire inspector would have a field day in here, Nikitin said.Jack laughed.Good news.I dont think theyre all dead.Burnt up.Is that ironic?Dont think so, Jack said.What if they were all attending an international fire inspector conference during the attack, and had exceeded their venues maximum occupancy?Maybe.I never got a good grasp on irony.The wolfish Colonel Galili stood at his podium.Settle down.Settle down.A hush passed through the crowd, and he began.Now, I know youve all heard a lot of wild theories, and command has decided to take the lid off rather than let these dangerous rumors persist.Let me categorically state that there is no legion of three meter tall super soldiers marching across Eastern Europe so far as were aware.A giggle shot through the room.Heres what we know.Six days ago, a strange device of unknown origin crashed near the Russian Ark.At first, they thought it was an unexploded enemy round, until it literally popped open and waved a white flag.Great.Even Bugs Bunny is shelling us now, Nikitin grumbled.When they finally worked up the courage to investigate the capsule, they found surprises inside.There was a binder full of high resolution orbital photos with enemy installations marked, a mini drive containing the same information, and a handwritten note that said keep hope alive.A low murmur rumbled all around.Now, it would appear that we have a guardian angel somewhere up above, but were not ready to rule out the possibility of a trap just yet.We are examining the information very closely, and will hopefully come to a decision one way or another very soon.While everyone else was whispering to one another, Jacks hand shot into the air.Is that Mr.Hernandez?What is your question?The Colonel knew him by name.That was new.I understand the information hasnt been confirmed yet, sir, but can you tell us anything at all?The pictures show colonization all along the equator in South America and Africa.The enemy vessels have planted themselves in the jungle, and seem to have transformed into makeshift cities.They have also established numerous observation posts and forts, forming a several hundred kilometer wide defense zone.Jacks hand was in the air again.Yes?My team has experience doing search and rescue in the Congo, as well as ops in Uganda and Kenya.Id like to volunteer to investigate the intelligence, sir.Galili stroked his chin for a moment.Stay and have a word with me, Hernandez.The rest of you are dismissed.Well have another announcement when we know more.Oooooh, Nikitin said.Jacks gotta stay after class.Not the first time, Jack said.The crowd filed out, already inventing new rumors to supplant the old ones.Nikitin and Albright opted to wait outside, while Jack went to have a chat with the teacher.Once the room was empty, Jack approached the Colonel.What can I do for you, sir?Galili was busy digging something out of his pack.He produced a large roll of paper a moment later, unrolled it and laid it out on a large wooden table.Have a look at this, Mr.Hernandez.It was a map of Africa with enemy emplacements marked in red.The Sub Saharan region was dotted with small checks, and four large circles staggered across the Congo, west of Lake Victoria.This is the intel, sir?More or less.Tell me how could I move, lets say, forty troops into theater.Alright.We know the Suez is a no go, and the rest of Egypt is pretty hot from the looks of this.A better bet would be to cross at the Bab El Mandeb bridge, and make your entrance through Djibouti.You think the bridge still stands?Probably.The aliens struck population centers, but they ignored roadways and bridges.If its down, you cross by boat.It shouldnt be too hard to find something sea worthy in the area.Interesting.And then?Follow the rift valley all the way to Kenya, then cross Uganda along the southern edge.That seems to be where outposts and patrols are the thinnest.His scarred fingers traced a trail from Djibouti and stopped near Lake Victoria.Good.Very good.What would you say, Mr.Hernandez, if I asked you to establish a forward base in Africa?Wait.What?That caught Jack off guard.He thought he was just giving advice.Few of us have experience south of Egypt.We need someone who knows the land.Someone who knows how to survive there.You lead a force along the route you just drew and investigate.If the intel is good, then you establish a base of operations and start hitting the enemy where it hurts.I Can I have a little time to think about this?Take a day if you like, but I already know what your answer will be.Youre the man for the job, and you know it.You were the one who told us to be bold, were you not?I suppose so, sir.And your trip lines are still racking up enemy casualties.More walkers fall every week.You want to hurt these bastards, and Id like to help you.A day?One day.Sleep on it.Jack wandered back outside, where Nikitin and Albright were waiting for him.What was that all about, hero?Albright asked.You get chewed out?No.Ummm The Colonel wants me to establish a base in Africa.Albright said, Wow.Nikitin laughed.Hot damn.You gonna do it?I dunno, Jack said, but yeah, I think so.About time, Nikitin said.Im getting sick of this dried up hell hole.Be nice to see some greenery again.Yeah.Jack was still weighing the decision in his head.Its a lot, though.Isnt it?Nikitin laughed.Maybe.Im just glad its not me.Youre not alone in that, Albright said.Smart mouth you got, little woman.Nikitin was smiling.Anyway Im gonna go scrounge up another dinner.Anyone care to join me?Nah.I got some thinking to do, Jack said.Albright waved.Youre on your own, pal.That last feeding frenzy of yours turned my stomach.Fine.More for me.With that, the lighthouse headed off toward the mess.Jack started walking in no particular direction, and Albright pinned herself to his hip.So tell me, why wouldnt you do this?she asked.I dunno, Jack said.It doesnt seem real.I dont even know how I got this far.Thats easy.As long as Ive known you, youve had a talent for just two things, Jack  surviving, and getting people to follow you.Thats crap.Only reason I ended up in charge of the Bravos was that no one else wanted the job.Bullshit.Two months in the corps, and you were already telling the brigade leader what to do.And he did it.When the position opened up, no one else would touch it because they knew it was yours.He laughed.That cut closer to the truth than he was willing to admit.Face facts, Jack.If you march into hell, me, Leo and the others will follow you right on in.And youll bring us out alive.Its what you do.He heard something in her voice that he hadnt noticed before, and he turned to look at her.The months of hardship had taken their toll, and shed become cold and calculating in a way Jack never could have expected.But beneath that, stars were glimmering distantly in her eyes.The realization didnt prepare him for what came next.Lisa Albright grabbed Jacks collar, tugged his face down to hers, and she kissed him.Her lips were warm and soft and sweet.Her mouth was tender, and for an instant, Jack was lost.For an instant, he was kissing Jess back on a rainy day in San Jose.He pulled away but stayed close, with his eyes closed and her hot breath breaking on his lip.His own breaths were heavy, and his heart was beating against his chest.I cant, he whispered.I know, she said.One of her hands was on his chest, and he was sure she could feel the thumping beneath.Youre still mending that broken heart of yours, but someday its gonna heal.Ill be here when it does.He was speechless.She knew him a little too well.Lisa Albright left another gentle kiss on his lips, then turned and walked away.Ill see you in the morning, hero.Jack vaguely recalled that he had to make some kind of decision, but for the life of him, he couldnt remember what it was.Chapter 33:  Tin Can  and that was the third time I got crabs.I havent returned to Maui since, and now chances for a future visit look bleak, for obvious reasons.Nils Jansen took a moment to scratch his thick beard.His razor still worked just fine, but hed lost the will to shave three months before, around the time he and the other two men aboard Copernicus Observatory were supposed to run out of supplies and starve to death.They didnt starve, partly because of intelligent rationing, and partly because they ate everything even remotely edible, including their shaving cream.Besides, he thought the shaggy beard was appropriate to the predicament.He clicked the mouth piece on again.That blackened mess currently on screen is Korea, as seen at night from a great altitude.Our viewers at home might have noticed it basically looks like a well, a shapeless blob of land.Most peninsulas in fact look similar from great altitudes at night, and one could easily mistake Korea for Italy, Florida or the Yucatan.This blob is however notable, because because my software says its Korea.Now, Ive never been there myself, but I hear its just peachy.Or was, at some point in the not terribly distant past.Marco was on the other side of the command center, bouncing a tennis ball against the window over and over again, and Hopkins had curled up in a corner to read.Theyd all lost a lot of weight, but Hopkins still eerily resembled a pilot whale.He looked suspiciously like dinner, actually.Jansen shook that idea out of his head.I thought the third time you got crabs was in Maine, Marco said.No.I caught lobster off the coast of Maine.Idiot.Oh.You understand my mistake.Jansen took a sip of water out of his bottle.The stations filtration system was beginning to fail, and the waters flavor was becoming difficult to ignore.Musky.He chose not to think about what it tasted like.Marco missed his ball on the rebound, and went chasing after it.Ever been to Cape Cod, Nils?No, but Ive had vodka and cranberry juice.I always wanted to go there.Just once, Marco said.It was a dream.I figure sailing around New England is like the best thing in the world.Jansen watched the darkened Earth beneath them.Theyd passed Japan already and were now over the Pacific Ocean.Ive done some sailing.Its not all that.Im not talking about wind surfing at an island resort with a bunch of drunk hookers.I mean real sailing.On a sloop.Racing in a fancy regatta with the wind in my hair, a white sweater tied around my neck and a glass of red wine in my hand.Wow, Jansen said.Just wow.Something really weird musta happened to you as a child.Is it that strange?Uh, yeah.Jansen clicked the mouth piece.And that brings us to tonights question what makes a man dream of sailing the coast of New England?Joining us here in the Radio Free Copernicus studio is closet sailor, Marco Esquivel.Marco, are the rumors true?Do you think about the Massachusetts shore while you masturbate?Screw off, Nils.Riveting show, Hopkins said.How about you, Hop?Any secret fantasies about cutting a jib?Nope.Cant stand the ocean.I dream about cutting your throat sometimes, though.Zing!Right as Jansen started to laugh, there was a strange noise.It was a loud thunk, as if something had collided with the station.It sounded like someone docking.What the hell was that?Not sure, but it cant be good.Jansen pulled out a metal rod that hed carefully sharpened to a fine point.Hed planned to kill Hopkins with it when the last of their rations ran out.He was going to slide it between the vertebrae at the base of the whale mans neck, killing him instantly.Jansen didnt like Hopkins much, but he at least owed him a quick death.He wasnt surprised to see Marco and Hopkins with shivs of their own.Should we take cover, Hopkins asked in a stage whisper.No.Full frontal assault, Marco said.You go out ahead, and well be right behind you.It never fucking ends with you two, Hopkins said, exasperated.Jansen ducked behind his console.Dont talk like that, my cetacean friend.Everything ends.In fact, I bet yer gonna die real soon.There were a couple of loud pops, followed by a crackling noise.The acrid stench of ozone filled the air.Whatever happens, Jansen said, I want you sons of bitches to know I hate you both.Same.Ditto.There was a whine of metal shearing, followed by a gong like clang and then silence.Hopkins and Marco both found their own hiding spots evenly spaced around the room.Then they heard the approach.Something moved through the inside of the station, pawing at the guide rails and scraping along the walls.All three men had been aboard Copernicus so long that each noise gave them new information, told them what bulkhead the invaders were passing and how quickly they were progressing.The monsters split up at the habitation hub, while one headed toward the command center alone.A mistake.The alien bastard was going to be easy prey.Jansens head suddenly filled with twisted fantasies.He imagined killing the invasion party one by one, stalking them like animals in the wild before sinking his shiv deep into their skulls.Then hed commandeer the enemy ship and return to Earth, where the surviving humans would give him a heros welcome.With the captured alien technology, the resistance could craft new weapons and finally turn the tides of war back on their oppressors.Eventually, months or maybe years later, they would drive the enemy from their planet once and for all, and Nils Jansen would be immortalized with a marble statue the size of a skyscraper, which people would revere and worship for all time.A bright light emerged from the shaft, and Jansen blasted back into the present.The things lamp was so bright that he couldnt make out the shape of it.How many arms did it have?Did its jaw gape open like a snakes?Was it covered in breasts?The creature floated out into the middle of the command center and Jansens moment had arrived.He wheeled into position, put his feet against the wall and pushed off, screaming, Die you alien bastard!Shiv in hand, he hurtled through the air, slobbering with fury as he went.The things lamp turned toward him and shined him in the eyes, but he would not be deterred.He neared his target and thrust his weapon forward, only to stab at open air.The creature had evaded his strike like a Spanish matador taunting a bull, but the tactic only stoked Jansens anger.He twisted around and prepared to launch himself off the next wall, then finally got a good look at the invader.It was a man in a standard white GAF pressure suit.The light came from his helmet lamp, and he was waving his arms around spastically.What in tarnation?Jansen asked, and briefly wondered what or where tarnation was.The suited man unlatched his helmet and pulled it off, revealing a wonderfully familiar face.Mason?Mason Shen had a silly grin, but it quickly faded to a look of total disgust.Oh man, it stinks in here.Mason, is that you?Im hallucinating.Im just imagining you, right?Nope.Youre not imagining me, but I wish you were.Jesus almighty is it foul.Sorry, Marco said, our subscription to Good Housekeeping ran out a couple weeks ago.I dont understand, Jansen said, how are you here?Did Donovan bring the Shackleton back?The Shackleton?That bucket is long gone, buddy.Were here testing out Faulklands new ship, Phoenix.Listen, its a long story, and Id like to do as little breathing in here as possible.Why dont we get out of this stink pit, hop back in the skiff and get you guys a shave and a shower?That sounds nice, Marco said.Hopkins was already floating dreamily toward the shaft.Jansen went back to his console and clicked on the mouth piece one last time.Due to unexpected developments, it appears that Radio Free Copernicus will be going off the air.Id just like to take a moment to thank our long time listeners.To all of our supporters out there in radio land, thanks for listening during this long strange journey, and keep on truckin.Are you done?Mason asked.Completely.Lets blow this popsicle stand.Chapter 34:  Peeping Tom  Jack knew Uganda and Kenya well enough, and he thought he was pretty well acquainted with the Congo rainforest too, but things change.The Earth was now one of those things.The dense jungle had been supplanted by a new environment.A complete alien biosphere.The invaders hadnt just colonized; they were transforming the Earth into a different world altogether.Near the alien city, green jungle gave way to a strange twisting growth of orange and purple.The branches of alien trees joined together and intertwined in a latticework, making it impossible to gauge where one plant ended and the next began.They formed distinct levels suspended above the ground that Jack and his team traveled across with ease.The wildlife was overtaken as well.The team saw plenty of native animals on the shores of Lake Edward, including hippos, elephants, crocodiles and even some okapi, but as they ventured deep into the alien world, they found creatures like nothing from Earth.Strange things with tendrils surrounding their mouths and multiple sets of wings flapped erratically overhead, while furry little beasts with arms ending in long hooks and too many eyes swung from branch to branch.The ground below was scavenged by a strange, sedate animal with leathery skin, which crawled around on five human like arms, and devoured bugs it found with a long snout.It occasionally let out a call that sounded just like a poorly tuned bassoon.The only natives curious enough to enter the strange world were Jacks team and the occasional band of chimpanzees, both of whom avoided the forest floor and anything not of their world.The passing chimps would sometimes stop to watch Jack and his crew move from cover to cover, before taking off for some other destination.A few kilometers into the obnoxiously colored forest, they finally found what they were looking for.The forest thinned and came to a halt, giving way to delicately arranged gardens and crop fields of yet more alien plants, and another half kilometer beyond sat an impossibly large alien fortress in cerulean blue.It stood exactly where the maps had indicated.The great disc shaped city was twenty kilometers in diameter, and sat above the ground atop a jumble of roots which dove into the soil below.The body of the disc was split open like a fruiting mushroom, revealing an interconnected network of gills, stalks and bulbs within.The inside was its own kind of forest, one overflowing with activity as its denizens went about their daily business.All of this was hidden from the sun beneath the top part of the disc, an umbrella shaped cap whose inside glowed like an immense street lamp.Thats a city?Nikitin asked in awe.Charlie nodded.Is it really that different than Manhattan?Yeah.Looks like something you find growing in your sock.Jack raised his binoculars and tried to take it all in, but there was just too much to absorb.Charlie was right in a way.The details were foreign, but the shape was the same.It was a living city, with its own congested traffic and bustling neighborhoods.Jack could only see the very edge of it, but he could tell there was a lot going on inside.Charlie started snapping pictures through his visor, while Jack brainstormed ways to get a closer look.They werent going to learn anything useful from the park across the street.He wanted to get into the backyard, or maybe break into the basement if he could.I cant figure it out.How the hell do we get in?Jack asked.I dunno, Lisa said.Anyone remember to bring an armor division?Nikitin snapped his finger in mock disappointment.Drat!Left it in my other pants.Yeah, yeah, yuck it up, Jack said dryly.He wondered why he was always stuck with such smart mouths.Usually, you just do like the Romans do.Nice thinking, Charlie, Nikitin said.Should we do like the four armed Romans, or the six armed ones that float?Point taken.The team moved on when Charlie was done taking pictures, keeping to the thick bush at the edges of the alien civilization.They didnt move particularly fast, and the circle around the city was over sixty kilometers in circumference, so it began to feel like they werent getting anywhere.They got better views of the crops and the creatures tending them.Fields were laid out in rows, filled with unfamiliar plants.Agriculture had never been Jacks strong suit, and he thought most vegetables looked kind of alien to begin with, so the fields were at best unsurprising.Of more interest were the creatures tilling the fields, which looked like short, squat versions of the walkers, but with large blades they dragged through the soil.Jack imagined they were also vehicles driven by the skinny white pilots.The team stopped after a klick, and something in the distance caught Charlies eye.He flipped down his mask and dialed up his optics.Hey, how about Romans in hooded robes?Jack brought his binoculars back up, and he could just barely make out a small group headed out from the city.There were eight of them walking in single file, dressed in graphite colored hooded robes, like futuristic Franciscan monks.Well, Ill be damned, Jack said.The monks walked out to a cobblestone circle surrounded by meticulously arranged plants, stood at the edge and began to pray.At least, Jack assumed they were praying.They put their arms out and looked up toward the sun, and just stood that way for a little over twenty minutes.That might just work, Jack said as he watched.He turned away from the prayer circle and started looking for nearby cover.He was looking for a place to stage an ambush, and he found it, a thin gouge in the land, maybe a creek, that ran within ten meters of the circle.Lets consider this a top priority.I want someone watching that circle whenever the suns up.They stayed and observed until the sun sat low on the horizon, then finally left back for the base camp    Chapter 35:  Civilian  The alien monks unerring patterns made them easy targets.During daylight, they came out every three hours to perform their ceremony, which lasted for twenty two minutes and thirty seconds.Their movements and positions were always precisely the same.Long distance observation revealed more of their kind in the city, dressed in identical robes and always traveling in groups of eight.Jack decided the robes would make ideal disguises, and he set his sights on acquiring a set.After a week of watching, the team moved into the nearby ravine, waited for the right moment and then struck in the middle of the monks prayer session.They did it with knives, their work intentionally messy in order to make it look like a wild animal attack, then dragged the corpses back into the wilderness.The bodies left a trail of amber blood that glimmered in the sun.In the forest, they stripped the monks and left them for the scavengers to dispose of.They turned out to be yet another new species, not particularly humanoid but close enough for the robes to fit.They were bipedal with backwards hinged knees.Each arm split into two forearms at the elbow, both ending in identical four fingered hands.The head was just a bulb at the top of two thin stalks, carrying a pair of eyes and nothing else.Their mouth and ears were instead located on their slender torso, which was also where their brains were housed.The fact none of this shocked Jack revealed that his threshold for weird shit had jumped a few notches.A squad of jackrabbits came out to investigate the disappearance, and they sniffed around and chattered over the evidence for hours before returning to the city.A new choir of monks replaced the originals the very next day, but were now protected by pairs of bored looking jackrabbits who stood off to the side and kept watch.Back at the base camp, couriers arrived from the North carrying new orbital scans with improved detail.Most were focused on five hot spots arranged in a wide circle around the citys center.Command assumed they were generators, and they were marked as high priority targets.There was no info about how the generators worked, but their destruction would deal a significant blow, and maybe cause a chain reaction that could take down the entire colony.Orders were orders.Jack didnt know how well the disguises would hold up under scrutiny, so he planned the infiltration and bombing all in one fell swoop without a test run.If they were discovered, they wouldnt get a second chance.Worse, theyd have the enemy actively searching for them, making any operations in the region significantly more difficult.On the day of the mission, all forty Bravos gathered at the edge of the wilderness and waited for nightfall.Only eight were going in, while the others secured their escape route, and waited to provide cover fire if things went bad.The infiltrators were broken into two teams.Jack lead the fire support team, which included Charlie, Nikitin and Albright, armed with assault rifles and frag grenades, while Trash headed up the demolitions team, each carting around bricks of plastic explosive and detonators.They had enough to blow a dam from what Jack understood, and he hoped it was enough.Night fell and it was time.They painted their faces and arms matte black, put on their graphite robes and took off across the half klick between the forest and the city.They made good use of cover, keeping hedge lines and storage containers between themselves and their goal.No sense being seen in the open if they could help it.Then they came to the great blue city itself, which sat on a bed of roots that held it above the ground.There were gaps between the roots creating natural crawlspaces, and Jack wondered what lived down below.He wondered that in a purely academic sort of way, not in any mood to find out, or even get close.The last thing he wanted was to meet the alien version of a rattlesnake.
