We lie.Vasily could not contain his shock, and backed up, knocking into a passing Guard and tumbling down the sliding ramp, taking down another on the next level.The General would have offered a hand, but the viewing screen in front of them all flashed off.Everyone stopped what they were doing.Vasily remained sat on his backside at the bottom of the ramp.In place of the image of Gobisla there burst the large, scarlet face of an overweight man.His strawberry blond hair reached around his forehead tightly, stretching into a bow at the back.G ...G ...G ...Gweetings!the fat man called with a hysterical chortle, fwom the gweatest, most powerful, and supewiowsly affluent Wetani System!Home to the mighty Wetani family.He gazed down at the General, puzzled, but continued his obviously rehearsed introduction regardless.You now have two choices: continue onward and state your intended dealings here, or else turn and wun like snivelling little dogs!Which is it to be?Ruben unfolded his arms; his legs shook beneath him.I ask you give word to the Mater Retani Gobisla and his mistresses  What word?That General Ruben Berenguer of Titan seeks his audience.The portly chap almost fell from his chair.Genewal!Genewal!Titan!Heavens!Hum!he shouted to the little man cowering beside him.Hum!Go wun an ewand you sluggish fool!Tell my father  And with that the image disappeared.Ruben turned to the men and women stood around him, and the approaching form of Vasily with a weak, though slightly amused grin, and said, I gather that means yes.* * *  While the vast, metal body of the Quasar remained in close orbit, the vessels shuttlecraft descended through the dense gas clouds of the foremost moons in the Retani Peninsula.Once the signal had been received from Gobislan command and the General prepared his shuttle to embark for the given coordinates, Chief Vasily insisted on going with him, as did the Generals elite personal Guard, which vowed not to leave his side.And so together they descended.Vasily knew he had to remember his mission.The Cronat had made his charge quite clear.And so far it was working.He hung his head as he sat beside the General.For him it was too late.There was no stopping the coming events.He had truly surrendered his soul ...The name of the largest and most central moon in the Peninsula changes with each new family head, Ruben explained to him as their shuttle weaved its way along the moons dark horizon.For several years now it has been known as Gobisla, after the Master Retani Gobisla.And the planet?Vasily asked.The planet has no name.It is a ruined worlddeserted and forgotten.The planets three moons make up the Peninsula by themselves.Hellfire and Tartarus are used only as terraformed penal moons.Gobisla is where well find the master.Vasily gulped, doing his very best to contain his worry.Do you think it wise though, General, turning to these scoundrels for help?How do you know they will not kill you on sight ...or worse?I dont, my friend, but ...He bowed his head again, taking a moment to overcome some inner malady, before shaking himself alert.Nothing was ever won without risk.Well were certainly not short of risk, are we?But it seemed Ruben now paid little attention to his grumblings; the Chief followed his gaze, looking out of the window at the dark shell of a city below.In some way it resembled the domes of Titan, except there was something missing: an air of light or the warmth of civility.It was a shell, but an empty shell.Diving closer and closer to the black city one could understand why many of those born into the System of Proxima lived with so much hatred and shadow in their hearts; all there was was darkness.One of the strange domes opened partially as they approached and the General told the crafts pilots to take them inside.They obeyed without question.They all knew the risk they were taking, but they had faith in their leader.Among them, only Vasily knew the Generals true fate.Mere seconds after leaving the craft and entering a small, dark passageway, however, Vasily regretted joining the Titanese on their mission.The twelve Guard halted suddenly as the General, who stood at the front of the group, raised his hand to stop them.He had noticed something in front; a vast red shroud hung ahead, blocking their way, only visible in their torchlight.They continued forward slowly, approaching the shroud which hung, inviting, hungry, and sinister.Ruben held out his hand to touch it, perhaps hoping to sweep the lace aside and continue through.As his fingers stroked the refined cloth, however, the enormous red veil which should not have prevented their passing burst into a sudden, dazzling flame.Back!Ruben yelled.Go back!Get out!Vasily swore.Hed been right.Their only chance was to get out.It had been a mistake trusting the Proximans.But as they turned, the group found their path blocked by dark figures, numbers hardly discernible in the darkness.The Guard pulled out their coilbolts, ignited blue sparks, and aimed them at the forms.The Chief whipped out his blaster and Ruben ignited his own weapon.But what occurred next they were hardly prepared for.A swift blast of air burst in from above, dark brown and overpowering.Vasily coughed and choked.Poison!he cried, and he watched as the General and the soldiers around him swooned; in seconds they had all fallen to the ground.* * *  Mens voices and the sound of laughter pulled Vasily from his blackout.Coming around, he realised that he was being heaved along, his hands bound and legs dragging in the dirt behind him.The people around them, dressed in vivid colours and wearing strange and horrifying masks, sang and jeered, cheering a tumultuous chant of their captives:      Ikri ko ka!The Generals ours!He waltzed on in behind cold metal bars,  Theyre ours!Hes ours!And so are his men,  At one time they marched, but they wont march again!Cos Titan has fallen and Crilshar has more than  They do!Ikri ko ka!The Generals dead!If the Master dont kill him then well take his head,  Well cut and well slice and well make for a meal,  His Guard for the dogs but my!he will squeal!For though he has nil we will take from him still,  His life and his eyes and his will!Ikri!We will!Ikri ko ka!The Generals weak!Though once he was strong he is far past his peak,  His people they wander, and dark Saturns yonder,  But who?Ikri ko ka!We do!It continued for some time, as they were taken on and through tunnel after tunnel; hidden chamber and dark vault after another.Vasily kept his body limp, and only opened his eyes a fraction of an amount, hoping to glimpse movement from the others or at least remember the way they had come.But soon it became impossible.The singing and laughing went uninterrupted until they reached another red curtain, similar to that which had trapped them before.This went without flame, and he could make out the image of a tusked beast: a boar or pig.Then, the still dazed chief heard the sound of a voice.High pitched and full of a cunning jollity it spoke in the tongue of Crilshar, as all peoples in the System of Proxima were required to.Ikri ko kakriaa!it screeched.You have the general!Ikri ko kakriaa Berenguer!Though not as observable as a Crilshan, his accent displayed vocal tendencies comparable to that of the Dark Race.He lifted his head and watched the veil rise as though pinched by a concealed cord; and there stepped through a small, thin morsel of a man.He lifted his own mask, which resembled a dragon breathing fire, and smiled through crooked teeth at his prize.Wanam!cried the General from beside him, and all of the men jumped back in surprise.Wanam!he said again.You have us, my men and I!We are at your mercy, unarmed, and prepared to speak.Whatever will you do with us now, I wonder.The small, thin man stepped forward.Oh, I imagine my master will find a use for the famous general of Titan!He licked his lips and snapped his teeth in the dim light.Vasilys heart raced.The General had no idea what he was doing.They could only hope these creatures didnt kill them before Ruben made it before the Master Retani.Speaking of old Gobisla, Ruben began, I would much like  Smack!The back of the Retanis hand found the Generals face.The men around them hooted with laughter.You will not speak of my master, let alone in such disrespectful terms!I am Hum Haraa, and you will address me!Very well, Hum, Ruben said, are we to be taken before your most beneficent and gracious master, or not?Hum smiled eerily, pressing his face so close to the Generals that their noses touched.Hmmm ...NOT!Vasily gasped.What?Smack!A blinding pain shot through his head and he fell again from consciousness.Sixty      A bitter chill struck Ruben Berenguers bones.When he woke it was as though he had been in a long dream of centuries.He could have sworn he had heard Annas voice crying for him.Im here, he told her.Im here ...Ive come for you.Youre safe now.Another icy stroke hit him.He shivered.General ...General, wake up!He raised his pounding head and turned to see his men chained to the stone wall beside him, displayed in a long row.Most were awake, and bearing fearful expressions they had been stripped of their weapons, armour, and all of their clothing.He looked around the small cell and saw Chief Vasily, hanging in the centre of the room, also unclothed.The dungeon door swung open and Hum Haraa entered, and he was joined by the tallest and most stalwart warrior the General had ever seen.Hum, he pleaded.Hum, listen to me!We came here to warn your master.If you would only  No, no, no!Hum dismissed him.Quiet now!The door slammed shut and the large man strode over to Ruben, swinging an enormous fist into his chest and sending him into a spasm of splutters, while Hum tottered over to Vasily.With a bony finger he prodded the Chief in the chest, causing him to stir and gaze around at the sight before him.Terrified, he began to struggle.No, no, no, Hum said again, and he danced around the broad tables nearby, lifting from them pieces of equipment and the clothes and armour of the Guard.He grasped one of the coilbolts and fired in the direction of the hanging prisoners.A blaze of bright light.NO!Ruben screamed as the booming bolt slammed into one of his Guard, who collapsed unconscious, face burnt and smoking.Hum, please!The large man slammed a fist into his chest a second time.Ruben struggled to breathe, spluttering like hed been pierced with a Crilshan blade.Hum Haraa stopped dancing and laughing and placed his large dragon mask back over his head.If youll excuse me, he said, I have a feast to attend to!I shall leave you here with my, hum, formidable friend!And he danced off, singing, Ikri ko ka!Ikri ko ka!Ikri ko kakriaa, HA, HA, HA!The large Retani turned and smiled with an enormous jawbone, chock full of black headed incisors.Ruben stopped struggling and wheezed in sharp gasps.He didnt know how to get them out of this.Hed fallen at the first hurdle.His girls would not have their uncle to save them now.He closed his eyes and listened to the sound of his men; they were not whimpering, simply watching, silent, as the creature before them made his way through their belongings.Opening his eyes again Ruben watched the man take out another coil and copy Hum, striking the Guard beside him with a deadly bolt.Still his men remained silent.The Retani then lifted out of the pile of possessions the Generals black and silver coilbolt.He swung it back and forth but it didnt work.It activated for him alone.The Retani hammered it several times on the table in frustration, but very soon it was not the coil which found his interest.Ruben cringed as the creature raised a silver, black orbed necklace from the pile.No, Ruben said.Thats ...no, thats mine.The Retani grinned, drooling saliva down his front.He placed the necklace down upon the table and lifted the coilbolt high above.Slamming the hilt of the coil down, the large man suddenly stopped.His head bobbed askew, and he gazed down at the jewel longingly, as though in a trance.Slowly, he lifted it up and placed it around his neck.No, he whimpered.Callista had given him the necklace when he was a boy.He had worn it all his life.It was meant to be Annas.As he bowed his head, a stifled howl came from the witless Retani.Without warning the enormous man seized up, clutching at his throat, shaking and struggling and gasping for air.He writhed and cried, though no sound surfaced.He collapsed to his knees and reached at the table for a nearby dagger; and he struck his own throat with the blade, fighting to free himself.A cruel thought struck Ruben as he watched, and he cried, Free me!Ill help you if you free me!Hurry!The large man dropped the blade and stumbled over, his face aflame a sickening purple.He slammed his hand onto the wall above, releasing the chain and freeing the general.Ruben leaned over instantly and attempted to wrestle the necklace free from his throat.Blood coursed down his neck as the silver metal cut through.The Retani gasped and panted, and finally tensed up, slamming into the ground, lifeless.Almost immediately, the necklace loosened itself and Ruben took it from him, wiping the blood on the Retanis garments.This necklace is special, Callista had told him, long ago.It protects the bearer in uncertain odds.Indeed it does, he said aloud to himself as he turned and released his men from their shackles.Get back to the shuttlecraft, he told them as they dressed and re armed themselves.Do as I say now.I must go on alone.You cant be serious, Vasily said.Too many have died already.And where are you going?Ruben placed a hand on the chiefs shoulder.Im going to get what I came for.The dead Retanis breastplate and helmet were too large for the General, but he managed to place the armour over his own; then, after watching his men run back along the tunnel, he proceeded to stumble towards the place from which a great furore of noise and music echoed.The bellowing rang louder as he moved slowly through, weighed down by layers of armour.The shrill swishes and harmonies of stringed instruments, joined by the deafening dance of drums and percussion, sent a tremble down the tunnel, until eventually he emerged in a stone courtyard.Beyond a score of tables rose a great stage upon which scantily clad women danced with multi coloured streamers; they moved around an extended table where a dozen enormous men and women sat feasting.There was no doubt: it could only be the great Retani Family.Between Ruben and the stage sat at least two hundred less extravagantthough just as largemen and women, and they sat feasting, chanting, singing, and launching streamers and food into the air, as a man danced from table to table.Hum Haraa, still sporting his daunting dragon mask, was dressed in bright clothes of red, yellow, and purple; he was no soldier, no captain; he was nothing but a mere court jester.Ruben stumbled down the stone steps and circled the border of food laden tables.His stomach ached at the sight of it all.In a matter of minutes the General reached the great stage and stood as though on guard nearby.His heart beat wildly; his legs shook from the extra weight.He was so close.He had only to climb the steps beside him and he would be able speak to Retani Gobisla.He was considering doing just that when laughing and jeering exploded at the other edge of the courtyard.The feasting mass shifted in their seats.Ruben gazed across and his legs almost gave way.Every last one of his men was pushed down the far flight of steps and through the room; Hum Haraa ran over and danced at the fore as they were dragged past the General, up the steps, and onto the stage.He swore under his breath and, as though instinct had kicked in, followed the prisoners onto the platform.He forced his way through and took hold of the Chief.Vasily pulled away but Ruben held firm.He knelt down, whispered, Its me.Stay calm.Dont move.Vasily stopped struggling and swallowed deep.However, before the General could react, Hum Haraa had descended from nowhere, wrapping coloured cloth around the General and his legs, pulling him to the ground in agony as everyone around laughed and pointed.Hum removed his stolen helmet and kicked him in the chest several times; he fell to the ground, directly before Master Retani Gobisla.Imposter!squealed Hum.Imposter, Master!Did I do good?Shall I cut him?Hes an imposter, a dangerous thing!Ruben ripped one of his arms free and gripped his knife.He head butted Hum and sent him shrieking across the stage.Everybody in the audience suddenly stood, raising handfuls of food which they began to toss at him and his Guard.But the General rose to his feet.Hum launched himself back across the stage, but Ruben caught the jester and forced him onto his back; he drew a knife to his throat, gripping his blaster with his other hand, pointing the tip at Master Gobisla.Men and women among the lower tables gasped.The music stopped and guards surrounded him.Silence.Then, quite unexpectedly, Master Gobisla began to laugh.A roaring chortle filled the stage and the rest of the Family joined in, looking to each other with great unease.Ha!cried Gobisla, his golden robes hugging his globular form harshly.A most excellent birthday present, Hum!I hadnt thought of executing you before.Hum whimpered and the smirk disappeared from Gobislas inflated face.Ruben stood as straight as he could, the blaster aimed towards the Retani.I will not shoot you if your men stand down, he said.Nobody budged.You damn well move!screamed Gobisla to his men, who looked to each other and backed away.Fools!He looked at the display before him and smiled again.What do you want, General?You know who I am?Who doesnt?He nodded, satisfied the Retani understood his desperation.I have to speak with you, alone, concerning a matter of dire importance.Oh, yes?You should have been told, father, spoke the strawberry haired boy sat to his right.I sent Hum to wun and tell you the Genewal was awiving.Gobislas lips pressed together.He breathed in slowly and counted to ten, though becoming lost at eight he reverted to pursing his lilac lips once more.Of dire importance you say, General?Ruben nodded once.A threat, of which neither of us can escape, nor ignore without consequence.The Master Gobisla moved his vastly packed plate aside and his servants helped him from his seat.He peered intensely at each of his family members, his blushing son in particular, breathing fast and heavy from flaring nostrils, before gazing only at Ruben.Very well, he said.We speak.Sixty One      An ultimatter path stretched from one world to another, from one System to the next, and it shone through colour, any shade, any tone of light or dark; but to the naked eye it shimmered with a spark of sapphire, rippling through the bare reaches of Alignment Space.But this was not Alignment Space, and the path glowed weak, barely visible to any who observed.The ultimatt path resonated silently, pulsing intensely as a craft travelled by.It was the Fated Chaos, captained by one Antal Justus.After a journey of four long days the Chaos had tracked the veiled path of radiation and reached its end; and the familiar globe flashing azure and amethyst welcomed it to the enormous rock in orbit above Tempest Beta.And once again Justus made his descent into the great triangular structure formed over and within the deathly black moon.However, this time there was no signal to greet and guide them down: the first warning sign for Justus that something was very wrong.The Chaos opened the docking gate remotely and the young captain saw to it that his ship set down once more inside the Erebus station hangar.Have your coils primed, he told his men as they stood in the cargo hold, ready to open the rear access ramp and discover the fate of the people of the station.Keep your weapons on maximum setting.He was taking no risks, knowing what could be out there.As he issued his instructions and the men organized themselves, he gazed back through the dark hold at the still, silent prisoners at the other end.He looked at Anna.It was all wrong.Captain?asked his lieutenant.Justus pulled himself together.All right, he said, let her drop.The ramp lowered and they all stood in silence.The hangar was bare.Not a ship or light or man or woman was there to see.Perhaps they had left, abandoned the station and escaped.There was only one way to be sure.Justus was the first to disembark; and he ordered half a dozen of his men down one end of the bay; the rest he led down towards the other.Directing his torch and the red glow from his coil around, he spotted something on the deck.What is it?asked the burly lieutenant as they knelt down.Justus looked closely at the floor grate and stroked his hand across it; he lifted his blackened glove close and smelt the residue.Electrically powered burns.Someone has fired a coil in here.Theres more here, spoke another soldier.Theyre covering the walls too, muttered another.Blows were exchanged.It looks like a fight broke out.Or an attack, Justus murmured.Were not safe in here.Listen up!Were going to do a swift and silent sweep and then get back to the ship.He was becoming less and less comfortable with the whole Erebus Project, not to mention the kidnapping part of his duties.He hadnt left his old life and his crew for this.Even as he debated with himself what to do next, the slight tapping as of footsteps reverberated across the platform.They drove along slow and steady, and then stopped.Justus men looked to him and raised coils and rifles towards the sound of the metallic echo.Justus moved, one deliberate boot step at a time, in the sounds direction, raising his weapon and holding his breath.He wouldnt hesitate to fire if need be.I knew it would be you, declared a familiar voice, stiffly.Justus stopped and stood deadly still.Step out so we can see you.The footsteps carried forward and from the cold darkness emerged a cloaked Xerin Kramer.He stepped closer, holding a pistol at his side, alone and watchful.You took your time though.Where is everyone?Justus asked.His men advanced, on their guard.What happened here, Professor?Kramer stopped moving; he continued to hold the pistol at his side.Justus inched closer.A tragedy, he said.An insane tragedy, Captain.Is is what I think it is?Was it them?He nodded once, his visible eye blood shot, the blend of white and black hair on his head scruffy and foul.How many have survived with you?His eye focused on the captain, shaking.Not many.He eyed the armed guard, one by one.Kramer, look at me.Where are they?Sir, said his lieutenant, addressing the Professor.Kramer turned to him.The mission?The mission was a success, sir.Forget the mission, Justus said.Where are they?Are we safe in here?Nowhere is safe, Captain.We will have to leave.The Fated Chaos needs only minor tweaks, said one of the soldiers.If there are enough supplies it wont take too long to have her prepped for a destination of your choice, Professor.Justus ignored him.Wheres Ketrass?he asked.Wheres Araman, and Lesper?Dead, he said, the corner of his lip curling into a smirk.That was it.He lifted his coil and threw himself forward, striking the professor and forcing him up against the far wall.This isnt funny!he cried.Whos dead?Dont smile at me like that!Kramer didnt react, but the lieutenant placed a hand on Justus shoulder and pulled him backwards.He turned to see several coilbolts re ignite behind him.Dont make us take you down, Justus.Us?The armed soldiers remained where they were.They were loyal to Kramer, not to him.Justus turned and retreated back towards the Chaos without looking back.Running up the ramp he took off his black overcoat and threw it to the floor, along with his PCD comm.It was all so wrong.As he sat there he considered speaking with Anna again.There was something about her, something that intrigued him, absorbed all his thoughts like only a night of severe drinking could ever do.After a few minutes the self satisfied lieutenant strode up into the cargo hold alongside Kramer.Several men stood at the bottom of the ramp.Captain, Kramer said.Well forget your little outburst.Ill put it down to lack of sleep.Have these prisoners woken up and brought through into Section Five.Make it quick.Prisoners?Creatures?Pieces of meat?He thought better than to lose control again, and so nodded and signalled for the men to prepare them to be taken through.As instructed the masks were removed and the fifty four men and women, drowsy and frightened, were bound and brought down into the dock.He intentionally left Anna, her sister, and the blond captain hed fought on Aurora until the end, in the hope that they would be the last to suffer whatever grim fate Kramer had planned.Removing the hooded mask and collective needles from Anna himself, he led her down the gangway; her teary eyes didnt once look away.Engineers were already checking out what the Chaos needed to leave.A few supplies and a bit of fine tuning and shed be good to go.How has it come to this?You dont have to do this, Anna said as they moved beneath the hangars tall entrance crown.Youre a good person.I know it, Ive seen it.He said nothing, and continued walking.Anna stopped.Why did you come and see me?Why did you offer me water?Why did you try to comfort me?She didnt understand.He had to do this; Kramer would have him killed if he thought him an enemy.He looked at her one last time.There was nothing he could do.But, as though she knew it was her last chance, Anna reached out and clutched his shirt, wrenching him back.Gilaxiad!she cried.Justus halted and spun; he knew that his face, if it were possible, had turned paler than it had ever been.What ...What did you say?You asked me if I believed in premonitions ...in dreams, she said.Well I do.Theres one in particular.The dark tunnel, he said.Annas mouth dropped.The black orb?His whole body shook, mesmerized.Yes.Captain!Kramers cruel timbre echoed across the dimly lit bay.Whats taking so long?You dont have that many!Anna knows about Gilaxiad.How can she know about Gilaxiad ...about the dream?I spoke about it to no one.Unless ...can it be her ...the woman from my nightmares?Captain!He stumbled, looking into Annas tender expression.I ...err  Come on!one of the soldiers shouted, marching over.Get them through there like the Professor says.Justus paused a moment, still looking at Anna, her sister stood terrified behind her.Then he ignited his coil and shouted, Come on, move along!Right through there!The blond captain moved behind Anna and urged her along.She took her little sisters bound hand and allowed herself to be pushed through to the far end of the hangar, drenched in dark red light.All the way she held his gaze.What he now felt was a strange relief, as though everything was suddenly clear, as though an enormous weight had been lifted from his shoulders, as though the Justus he once knew was staring back at him, grinning.And one thing above all others was as plain as night was black: he couldnt go along with this, not now.He had to help her, had to help them all.But he knew what the Professor did to those that disagreed with him.The soldiers were loyal to Kramer, and there was no way he could take them all on.We share the same nightmare.We dreamt of Gilaxiad.How is that possible?Through and into Section Five the fifty four were led by a dozen black clad soldiers.Justus strode behind, watching Anna, her long brown hair hanging down over her shoulders.He was sure: she was the girl from his nightmare.Hed seen those long brown locks so many times now, heard her voice in his head, haunting him.They quickly reached the room previously used as the mess hall.The room was still intact, except the chairs had all been heaped down one end and the tables lined up and stacked before the door, which had been welded firmly shut.They had built a barricade.On Kramers orders the frightened group was forced together in three long rows.Justus purposely placed Anna and her two companions down at the end farthest from the Professor.Keep your head down, he whispered as he placed her at the end himself.The blond captain stared at him and Justus nodded, hoping through hope he would understand.He stepped back and out of the way, looking around.As everything went silent, Avne Ketrass entered the room and stood at the Professors side.Wearing his long, black lab coat, Kramer stood still, arms behind his back.He eyed them all, one by one.It was as though he enjoyed seeing them frightened out of their wits; helpless and at his mercy.Justus couldnt leave Anna alone with Kramer.He backed towards the far wall, but as he did, a hand stretched around his mouth and he was pulled from the room and out of sight.Sixty Two      A man stood still before the captives.He was wrapped in a knee length coat, dark black and fine, and a metal face covering concealed almost one half of his colourless features.The one eye that was visible surveyed them all with untold menace.He began to pace, hands behind his back, down the cowering row.Anna shivered and peered about.Justus had disappeared.She could do nothing but hold her sisters shaking hand as they waited to discover their end.While the man continued to stride back and forth, looking more than pleased with himself, beside her Glanas whole body began to shudder.Anna held her up upright, but she tipped off balance and vomited bitter fluid over the ground.She whimpered and sobbed.Hush!Anna said.Quiet!Please, we have to be quiet!But the one eyed man had seen them.He stepped forward and looked down on Glana, lifting a small blade from his pocket and aiming it down at her.She looked up and he placed the knife beneath her chin.No!Anna pushed the blade away and crawled in front of her sister.Please, please, dont hurt her.The man sniggered and placed the knife back into his pocket, then knelt down and stared Anna in the eye.He smelled as foul as he looked.You look very familiar, he said.My name is Xerin Kramer.Whats yours?Anna, she mumbled.Anna Driad.Those overalls youre wearing, he said.I know them.Standard uniform of Titanese crewmembers.You see the eagle emblem on the arm gives it away.He stood.You dont look like soldiers.Tell me, who are you?He spoke calmly, almost nicely.He glanced at Glana in a strange way.She was short and young and obviously no member of the Titanese Guard.Were refugees from Rotavar, she said.Youre lying.Im not.You are.A combat unit saved us from the Crilshan invaders.Only the two of you?Whats so special about you two?Her thoughts swarmed.She knew her story would not convince him, but she had to try.We stowed away.Liar.We werent found until we reached the outpost.We wanted to get to Titan  Dont lie to me, he said, and tapped his face covering.Tap, tap, tap ...tap, tap, tap ...tap, tap, tap.He watched her carefully, blood shot eye staring deep into hers.She focused hard and tried not to bat an eyelid.She could not hold it.She blinked.Kramer sneered.Whether thats the truth or not doesnt matter.Your fate will still be the same.And what fate is that?Ferranti asked.Kramer laughed.The original plan was youd all die painful deaths in the name of great science.But now Im afraid Im going to have to leave this station really rather quickly.So you are all, sadly, to die painful deaths in the name of getting me out alive.At once everybody began shouting.Some edged away from the group and one man jumped towards the guard nearest to him.Three more joined in, dragging him away.There were too many armed men, and the sound of a rifle pulsed through the room.One captive was thrown against the wall and then slumped to the floor, blood seeping down his face.Everyone remained still, quietly whimpering in dread.I dont like cowards, Kramer said.They arent useful to me.As he spoke, Glana lurched down on all fours a second time.More fluid poured onto the floor and she keeled over, retching.Anna turned to Ferranti, whose mouth hung open, eyes darting between the professor and the coiled men around him.Kramer looked at Glana strangely and whispered something to the dark haired woman nearby, who did not seem at all bothered by the scene before her.As Anna stroked her sisters hair, the woman approached them and examined Glana closely, testing her pulse and mopping her brow.She looked so poorly.Anna prayed nothing was wrong.She recalled Glana had been ill on the journey from Titan, and after leaving Rotavar too.She had complained of nausea, headaches, weariness.What if something had happened to her while they had stowed away?What if all that time at zero gravity had affected her somehow?Please be all right.The dark haired woman stood and walked back to Kramer.She whispered in his ear and he smiled.Are you sure?Yes, Professor.Very good, he said.Now, if you will all stand, it is time.Time for what?Ferranti asked, rising before the others.We no longer need you for our experiment, Kramer said.But if we are to escape, we will need a distraction.We will need bait.Sixty Three      Ouch!Geroff!Hang on!Let go!Tussling with his mysterious assailant, Justus found himself dragged down the corridor and out of both sight and ear shot of those gathered in the nearby hall.Let go!He couldnt leave Anna in there.Not with Kramer.Pulled into an empty corridor Justus thrust his foot into their path and took the hand wrapped around his mouth.Okay, okay!The attacker raised his arms and the Captain released him, relieved and maddened.It was Araman.Sorry, he said, blushing.But Kramer cant know weve seen each other yet, never mind spoken.You want to tell me whats happened here?Justus demanded.Wheres Lesper?Dead.Yeah, thats what Kramer said.It was them, wasnt it?It was those things.Araman nodded, fear flowing like blood behind his eyes.I knew it.Did you get my message?he asked.Some of it.I came as fast as I could.What were you doing all this time, Antal?Justus averted his gaze.Lesper told me he needed participants ...for Section Six ...test subjects ...easy strays ...said he knew the best place to retrieve them  You mean snatch them!Justus nodded, still avoiding eye contact.I didnt ask what they were for, though I could guess.I was a coward.I was wrong.He hung his head at the disgust upon his friends face.But Im not going along with it anymore.Araman, we have to stop him.I know, my friend.We will.But Im afraid theres graver news.He checked down the corridor for anyone or anything, and then spoke quietly.After those things escaped and attacked us, he said, we sealed off certain portions of the base as best we could, mostly the lower areas on both sides, closest to Section Six and the two entrances to the Black Labyrinth.Did it work?I wish it had.Only the beasts, they didnt act as Kramer said they would.Killed a great part of the base crew to begin with, then disappeared into the Black Labyrinth.The one place we cant follow them down.At first we thought that was it.But that night they came back.And they kept coming back.Every night theyd return, and every night theyd take more of us.And there was nothing we could do to stop them.They terrify me, Antal ...they scare me more than anything ever has.Theyre unnatural, filled with an evil.We ...We lay still and prayed they wouldnt take us.We did not put up a fight.Cold hissing and the stale stench of death, c ...clawing hands reaching for us ...in the dark.Eventually Kramer decided that wed start choosing who the creatures could take.What?Yes ...he said that the oldest would go first, the men and the workers of little value.He would not allow any of the soldiers to be sacrificed.Said that they were needed in case the beasts ever came for all of us.And I assume the brave professor never at one point put himself up for martyr?Of course not.But then, neither did I.  The young man fought the tear in his eye, and sighed lengthily.Justus placed a hand on his shoulder.You did well, Araman.If it wasnt for your message we wouldnt have a ship to escape on at all.Everyone would be trapped here.Araman winced.Thats the thing, Antal.Kramer doesnt plan on letting everyone go.What?Avnes been working closely with him, helping him.According to her he plans on using the people you brought back as one single mass sacrifice so that a selected few can leave on the Chaos.He cant do that!He can do whatever he wants.Everyone listens to him.I told him what he was doing was absurd, and hes not spoken to me since.Hes been watching me.Doesnt trust me.Thats why I had to speak to you first, without him knowing.Justus peered around the nearest corner, though it didnt appear anyone else was there.He moved close to Araman.The soldiers are loyal to Kramer.We cant take him on in front of them.Is Ketrass trustworthy?I dont know.Private Riess is, I think.Well we need to do something quick.Any ideas?Well, Araman said, its risky, but  SLAM!An open door struck the wall and voices echoed down the dark corridor.Another door veered open and along marched three armed soldiers; behind them trudged the bound and exhausted prisoners.Kramer was with them, and Ketrass beside.Justus watched Anna as she walked near the front of the shaking group.She looked to him, not with the fire and passion and strength, but with tears, terror, and despair.The blond captain shuffled along behind.But Annas sister wasnt with her.The line of prisoners continued past but Kramer stopped beside Justus.The Captain turned to see that Araman had slipped away; the Professor hadnt seen him.The captives are to be taken down the elevator in Section Two and then left at the bottom, Kramer said as they followed the marching rows through the dock.The elevator will then be destroyed and the shaft blocked indefinitely.Is that a problem, Captain?Professor, Justus said, we seem to be missing one of the captives.Wheres the young blonde girl?How perceptive of you, Captain.Kramer smirked.Got an eye for the younger ones, I see.Of course not!You neednt worry.The young girl will be kept with us.But sir, for what?Is that  Enough, Captain.Is it a problem or not?Justus looked across the bay and spotted Araman and Ketrass standing nearby.Araman nodded once.This was his chance.Cut Kramer down and then talk your way out.It normally works.If not, free as many prisoners as you can.Nothing lost.Now was as good a time as any.Lowering his head and taking one long, deep breath, Justus lifted from his belt his advanced coilbolt.Igniting it he swerved towards the Professor  but at once a burning pain shot through his arm.The coil fell to the ground.He looked at Kramer, who continued to clutch the knife hed sunk through Justus left arm.Struck by the sudden shock of it he cringed in blinding pain and fell to his knees.Kramer withdrew the blade in one burning slice and cracked Justus over the head with the blunt tip.A dull pain filled his head.He couldnt breathe, couldnt process what had just happened.Theres nothing I hate more than conspirators, Kramer said.The group had stopped moving, engineers listening nearby, the soldiers rifles primed, and Araman and Ketrass rushed over.Men who say one thing and do another.I may be deemed unfair, but I rarely deceive.No, Justus replied through gritted teeth, gripping his leaking limb as a sudden numbness came over him.You just prefer to deceive yourself!Kramer leaned forward and gripped the Captains hair to pull him close.Blood trickled from his arm and down his black uniform.Its over, Istron, he said.I know who you are.He breathed deeply, panting.Who am I?Just as we thought, Kramer whispered.A child you once were, lonely and clouded, mistaken and ignored.You dont know yourself, do you?You poor creature.You sicken me.He raised the knife edge.Oh, Peter Marx, you should never have run away.He made to plunge it down  No!Araman threw himself in the way.You cant!And whys that, Alwar?Kramer retorted, standing.Because ...well ...best not to spill his blood in here.The beasts can sense it, can they not?It wouldnt do to bring them back now were ready to leave, surely.Kramer tapped his face covering twice.Thats true.And you suggest?S ...Send him in with the others.Sacrifice him as well.Ketrass advanced to his side.I agree, she said.Better than killing him here, in front of everyone.She gestured to the Chaos engineers, who had stopped to watch the commotion.Justus watched the two collaborators.Theyd betrayed him.Ketrass looked away but Araman stared him in the eye.He shook his head; theyd betrayed him.Very good, Kramer said.Lieutenant!Take them all down now; the Captain as well.The lieutenant and a group of soldiers sauntered over.Right away, Professor.Justus didnt fight as three of his own soldiers dragged him through the dock and into Section Two.The first elevator was right ahead.The initial group of fifteen was quickly sent down, followed by a further two groups, while the rest waited above.Justus caught sight of Anna watching him silently.Whoever she was no longer mattered.It was over.As the elevator returned with two soldiers stood inside, the rest of the captiveswhich now included the man once captain of the stationwere pushed within.The third and final tribute.Wait!called a voice down the tunnel.Justus twisted, hopeful of a last minute rescue, though what he saw was an out of breath Araman charging towards them.What is it?said one of the soldiers.I hope youre here with good reason!The best, Araman said.Professor Kramer sends his regards to the former captain of Erebus.He held up Justus black overcoat.Apparently it gets a little chilly down there.He sniggered and the soldiers laughed and snorted.The lieutenant turned to Justus with a smirk.I never liked you, Justus.And he threw a punch into his abdomen, knocking the wind out of him and pushing him back into the elevator.Araman hurled the folded up coat at Justus and smiled oddly.Their eyes met.He winked.The elevator hatch slammed closed.Darkness fell.Sixty Four      The drums of war were beating.At the heart of the dark kingdom of Yux Dishan lay his molten planet.Rivers of orange light flowed across the surface like blood pouring over a stone.Crilshar had marshalled all neighbouring Proximan forces in preparation for battle.Yux Dishan knew his enemy was coming for him.Everyone an all sides knew there was no turning back.One hundred thousand men and women were ready for the assault upon Crilshar.Vastly outnumbered, it would be down to skill and fastidious preparation to win victory, though despair swelled and hope grew less and less the closer their confrontation came.Captain Ernesta Mendoza swept down the Quasars shady blue corridors, alone and making for the generals private quarter.Three days had passed since their departure from the Retani Peninsula.Ruben had remained silent about his agreement with the Master Retani Gobisla, but he did announce the new alliance, albeit gravely.And so they had leapt toward the edge of Dishan space, ready to rendezvous with the Vons forces from Earth.The assault upon Crilshar would be over swiftly, for good or evil.She knocked on his door.He allowed her in and she stood by his one way window, overlooking the barracks below: a great deal of movement and preparation was taking place.I expected youd send for me sooner, General.Ruben, please, he answered.I did not call you for your captaincy.Then as what?As my friend.Is that all?His lip trembled.The Alignment has failed, Ernesta.I dont believe that.The worlds of the Systems lie apart.This Alliance of Four has gathered, but there are not enough to turn any tide.We have the Retanis now.Their forces  Not enough.Crilshar possesses Erebus.He looked her in the eye.I will go down there and discover what Erebus is, where it is, and then I will destroy it.The Crilshan database will know.And with it I will find my girls.Its all linked, Ernesta.Is this really about Erebus ...about Crilshar?He bowed his head.I miss them.I miss them all.Mendoza had not expected to see her general in a weakened state; especially not now.She reached for his hand and held it in hers, comforting in the only way she knew how.Anna and Glana are strong, she said.Stronger than even you or I.   They have been through so much.As have you, Ruben.My brother suffered the same.I miss him too.I know you do.He shook his head.How can I go on?How can I fight these monsters?The only way you know how.By remembering what youre fighting for.And I will be with you all the way.You have been by my side all this time.Callista was right.I knew how fortunate I was.But I never told you, or thanked you.There will never be the need.She leaned upward to kiss him, but he pulled away.She felt the blood rush to her face as she turned her back on him, eyes closed.Do you trust me?he asked.Ernesta, do you trust me?Something tells me I could ask you the same, she said.And you just may be right to do so.Im taking us to war.How many disagree with this course, and how many more will die for it?She turned and gazed at him carefully.His eyes glazed over and his shoulders hung low.In the palm of his hand he grasped a silver necklace.Ruben Berenguer, you have not become the general you are by ignoring the very thing that makes you so powerful, she said.Your power is your decency.Your decency is your nature.And your nature has never let you down once.You are not going abandon it now.I wont let you apologize for choosing to act when we both know it is necessary.Not necessary.Vital.I wasnt alive when we went to war with Crilshar the last time, she said.Ruben looked up, and she saw in his eyes the distant memories of a tormented childhood.She wasnt there, but the Captain knew all about the first Titan Crilshan war.Yux Dishans father, Yu, and his elder uncle, Sumat, had envisioned an Alignment led by Crilshar, which itself had grown to be fierce and prevailing.At a time when the Alignment was weak, lacking in leadership, and supporting a fourth phase of colonization, the High Council on Crilshar seized its moment well.I was only a young boy at the time, Ruben said.Before then my father would take me on his visits to the other worlds.But the last one he took ...he left me behind.Ill never forget comforting my little brother, Dathlan, when my father went away to fight the Dishan regime, or that empty feeling holding my mothers hand when we stood at his burial.Mendoza reached out and took his hand.She held it up slowly and kissed it, before leaning forward and kissing him on the cheek.Do you trust me?he asked.Am I doing the right thing?She knew exactly what he was asking.I cant say how sorry I am about your family, she said.You are in a terrible position.Yet, you are the only person I have ever known that I can say I believe in absolutely.Youve always chosen your words carefully, Ernesta, and for that Im grateful.But I do not consider belief and trust to be the same thing.You may believe in me, Captain.You may believe in my ability to burn Crilshar to an endless pit.But when it happens, would you trust me to pull you from the flames?These past weeks, she said, his hand held in hers, my belief has never wavered.My trust in you as a man I have questioned.But no man is perfect.We all strive to be better, to be better than one another, to be more than it would seem we can be.And no man I have ever known has come as close as you have.Yes, I trust younow more than I ever have, Ruben.He gripped her hand tenderly and nodded.Thank you.I do trust you.Its what separates us from the Dishan.And now thats clear, I will reveal to you the design for the invasion of Crilshar.Not the one the others believe will happen, but my true intentionthe real design.Sixty Five      Everybody screamed out.Grown men whimpered like children while women clung to each other in the agonising reality of insurmountable odds.It was too dark to see much, and so Anna stood, petrified, in the midst of the panic and confusion.Shapes pushed and shoved.Noise and heat.The terrified bodies forced her back.She reached the edge and gazed down the corridor: a long tunnel, drenched in a pale red and lingering light, reaching into darkness.An unsettling draught sent cold shivers down her spine.They were not safe.She turned to the group, at least three dozen men and women; old and young; silent and hysterical.She could not see Ferranti, but at the other end of the commotion she noticed Antal Justus, and so pushed her way through.As she moved she noticed the Stellarstreams old commander, Naffan, among the crowd, but they were too tightly packed.She pushed through and found Justus leaning up against the hatch which had closed behind them, pressing his ear against the metal.She did so too, and listened through the cold wall to the dull roar coming from within the elevator shaft.Theyre sealing the passage, Justus said, his eyes wide.Theyve cut the cables.The elevator wont work.What does that mean?It means ...that theres no way out now.He dropped his coat and ripped the sleeve off his shirt.His face twisted painfully as he tied a firm tether around his bloodied arm.It was soaked.Theyve been sacrificing members of their group through the elevator passage in order to stay alive.Now theyll try and leave with the Chaos.The ship only needs minor repairs.Putting on his long coat he turned to her.I imagine theyll be gone within an hour or two.Were only in here to distract  What do you mean, sacrifice?Anna cried.Distract what?They ...They kept my sister up there!What are they doing with her?Tell me!He closed his eyes, threw his foot into the door, and swore with hopeless rage.He looked at her again, went to open his mouth  QUIET!Ferrantis voice filled the tunnel.All went silent.Anna and Justus turned with the group to the captain, who stood facing them, hands in the air.I know it seems hopeless, he said.And Im just like you.All I want to do is fall to the ground and not get back up.But if we all do that then were dead for sure.Look at us!somebody shouted.Were all dead anyway!Yeah!said a blubbing woman.You heard what he said back there!Theyre gonna leave us down here!A few women began crying again, holding one another upright.I ave a little boy back ome!So do I!I have a family!I know!Ferranti said.I know its hard!But hold onto those thoughts of your loved ones.Think about getting back to them, and we will!But at once everyone shouted back, and then at each other.Many did not speak the Common Tongue, and so the confusion worsened.Ferranti turned on the spot, looking back and forth.Quiet now!he said.Quiet!Theyre too loud, Justus said.We have to move.Anna looked from him to Ferranti, who had managed to gain the calm of group at last.Are you there, Anna?he called out.Im here!she said.Im all right.Good, he said, relieved.Now none of us know where we are.Some of us need rest, but I doubt we have time.First of all, lets move from here.Everyone stick together!This way!He gestured to his left which led off into the darkened tunnel.I wouldnt advise it, Justus said loudly beside her.Anna turned to him, as did everyone else.Silence again.Ferranti looked carefully, and upon seeing who had spoken it was as though lightning had struck between them.The Stellarstreams captain lunged forward, his eyes wild with madness; he took Justus by the throat, throwing him into the wall.IT WAS YOU!he screamed.YOU BROUGHT US HERE!IT WAS YOU!No!Anna cried, jumping between and gripping Ferrantis arm.Please no!He can help!He can  She found herself wrenched back.One of the group pulled her by the hair and threw her to the floor.She brought up her hands to cover her head as the crowd surged forward, terrified and desperate and thirsting for the blood of Antal Justus.Ferranti cried her name as she fell beneath the group.Feet thumped her in the face, straining her neck, numbing and blinding her all at once.Opening her eyes she looked up to see an intense red burning flash, a snap and boom and the cries of men, before amongst the frightened crowd silence fell.She closed her eyes.Beneath the chaos a hand grasped hers and dragged her to her feet.She thought at first it was Ferranti.Are you okay?Justus asked, pulling her close.Im okay, she said, wiping blood from her lip and gazing at the people now surrounding them.The bright red light of the flickering coilbolt flashed and hummed as Justus held it out, waving it as though it was the only thing stopping them from surging forwards once more.Where did that come from?she asked.It was in my jacket, he said.Araman must have ...Murderer!somebody cried.Kill him first!Breathing deeply, blood trailed down the side of his face from a cut above his eye.Anna, Im not one of them.Of course youre one of them!Ferranti said.You brought us here!He did, Anna said.But look where he is.Down here with us.That doesnt change what he did, Anna.I know, but if hes been here before, maybe that helps us ...maybe he can help us get out, maybe ...we need him.She shot him a glance, and his breathless expression was a combination of alarm and gratitude.A moment of cautious silence followed, before Ferranti sighed.Youre right.And thats a lot of maybes, but okay ...how do we get out?What do you suggest we do?Well, first of all, you dont want to go down there, Justus said, nodding down the tunnel to their left.Why, whats down there?A long, heart wrenching hiss filled the passage.Everyone stayed still and silent.Anna stared at Justus, whose face had flushed a deathly white.Sixty Six      If the crowd had been panicked before, then the tense cold which fell was now nothing compared.Justus looked to Anna, and then to the ground, his eyes darting in every direction.Thinking.Panicking.Whats going on?she asked.What do we do?One of the women nearby collapsed under the anxiety.Nobody helped her.The hiss which filled the corridor continued to echo among them when another severe sound called back as though in answer.Most stayed still, though some backed up to the elevator hatch.Pointless.Anna shivered beside him.Antal, what do we do?She took his hand.The pale, red light above wasnt enough to light the whole corridor, and so everybody stared, shaking, into the darkness ahead.Justus turned off his weapon, though he continued to grip it tightly.As expected, when a third hiss rang along the corridor, the crowd of fifty four exploded in panic and horror.Despite both captains cries not to run, many launched themselves in different directions.From the corridors intersection some ran right and others darted left.Some even rushed directly ahead, unknowing of where the sound came from.The blond captain backed up and took Annas hand, and he pulled her down the corridor to the left.No!Justus cried; but, still clutching Annas hand, he too was pulled left.The hissing rang out right behind.The beast had found them.Ferranti!Anna called.Wait!Where are we going?The three piled down a corridor, steam pouring from the walls; spray merging with the hisses of the beasts behind.Justus recognised the way Ketrass had brought him on their way down here before.As the light was left behind he ignited his coil, its faint glow providing a little light, and he pulled them the opposite way, down a ladder well.They hastened below, leaving the fleeing crowd up above.All was silent at the bottom.This way!Justus said, praying nothing lay in wait.They continued through a series of darkening rooms.Youre sure?Ferranti asked.Justus turned.I  A hiss pulsed through behind them.Weve been followed!Anna squealed and Ferranti took her hand.This way!He dragged them down another corridor.It was like a maze in the dark.And at once they found themselves nearing its end.Justus breathed heavily.He felt sick, lightheaded; the pain in his left arm blurred his thoughts, but the other two pulled him along.At the end of a narrow walkway they turned a corner, a hiss called out behind, and they found before them a narrow hallway, filled with small doors.Ferranti pulled them down and pushed his way through into one: a boxed off storeroom.Stay there!Justus said, opening another door beside it and pushing Anna within.The door slammed shut.He disabled the coil.Everything went black.The room hed chosen, also a small storeroom, was no deeper than a body.The two leant up against either side of the door, the glass pane which passed through a great portion of it running vertically between them.Annas breaths came in loud, lurching spasms and she pressed her hand over her mouth.Justus forced himself to breathe slowly, but he felt the blood sliding down his arm, along his hand, dropping from his fingers to the floor.Then he heard it.Loud, thudding footfalls sounded outside the door.Growling shapes moved along the corridor.Deep, heavy rattling.He couldnt breathe.His eyes became accustomed to the dark, and he watched Anna reach out to lock the door.He seized her arm tightly.She looked up at him and he tried to shake his head.Their only hope was that the beast out there didnt know where they were.It mustnt have known, he told himself, because if it did the demon would already have broken through.He released her arm when something pushed up against the pane of glass.Anna shrieked and the door began to rattle.Justus held his breath.He wasnt ready.He pushed all of his dark thoughts to the back of his mind.He was back in the cockpit of the Flux.Adra was by his side; Kaara on the other; Noah, Raj, and Shree stood behind him.He should never have left them.The door swung open and Anna disappeared ...He would get back to his crew.To his friends.To his family.He promised himself.These beasts would not stop him.Igniting his red flaring coil he aimed high and cried aloud, and jumped from his hiding place  He stopped, heart beating faster than it ever had, as he looked into Ferrantis sweat drenched face.Anna cowered beside him.Theyve gone, Ferranti said in a whisper.That was unbelievably close.I dont know where they went.Ferranti, Anna sobbed, moving close to him.He stretched his arms around her.Justus clutched his chest.Anna ...Ferranti, you need to know what were facing.This place ...its ...no.First we need to move.Now.Where to?He held out his coil and they tread lightly down the passage.If Araman was right then the beasts would be taking the others into the Black Labyrinth that very moment.They wouldnt be gone long.He placed a hand into his pocket and happened upon cold metal.Araman, you genius, he said, and he pulled from within a concealed PCD comm device.I shouldnt have doubted you.Sixty Seven      Dark and disconcerting, the docking platform of Erebus station was a far cry from the place Avne Ketrass had known all these years.Around her men hurried back and forth, preparing the Fated Chaos for departure.She walked calmly along, recalling the very first time she descended through the dark crown.It seemed like another life now.Her face as she walked was, as ever, clear, undaunted, and her true feelings far from obvious.Aramans words of warning raced through her mind.Though Justus remained unaware, Araman had saved his life, and given him the tools to remain alive.Shed promised not to tell Professor Kramer.She just wanted to get away, to be free.No more death.Kramer was the real problem now.He was the one controlling the scientists, the soldiers.She knew he was different, so unlike everyone else.He was brilliant, magnificent, but he had another side: a darkness, only visible in his single eye; a glow of black that flared whenever he had a spark of genius, no matter how terrible.She stopped and watched the crew inspect the inner workings of the Fated Chaos; the outer plate near to the ultimatt engine had been removed and she could see for herself that there was certainly some damage to contend with.But these engineers were the best.It wouldnt be long now.She twisted on the spot and moved off, heading for the room Kramer had taken the young Driad girl.Down the corridor, still glowing in a faint red light, lay the blockaded mess hall; the place Araman now sat, desperate and guilt ridden.She left him there and strode down another corridor of Section Five.Along the walkway she passed several rooms filled with what was left of the failed Erebus project: terrified scientists and engineers and once valued members of the station.At the walkways end she raised her access fob and entered a solitary room.Inside she found four men in black lab coats gathered around a metal table.Between them lay the young girl, unconscious and sedated.Nobody else knew why Kramer hadnt sent the girl down with the rest of them.Avne Ketrass knew exactly why hed kept her, but for what exact purpose she didnt want to guess.Kramer sat nearby in a leather chair, looking at something on a large screen up against the wall.Upon seeing her enter he switched it off, before standing to greet her.The others lingered behind him.Avne, my dear, he said.Is there a problem?No ...well, yes, Professor.I need to speak to you.She glanced sternly at the four science officers.Alone.Of course, he said, signalling for the others to go, and they each left the room, eyeing her distrustfully.As the last man left she locked the door and turned to her mentor, having pulled out her own small pistol.When he saw what she held in her hand he did not look shocked, however, or even the least bit angry.He simply sat back down.Youve come to kill me, dear?Ive come for answers, and no lies!she said, brandishing the weapon.Thats what this is for.I see.Better put that thing down then, before you do something disappointing.If its answers youve come for Ill gladly oblige.If you dont believe me Ill quite happily use that thing on myself.His expression remained untroubled.Walking over to the young girls body, Ketrass stood firm; she kept hold of the weapon.Kramer frowned.Very well.Just dont blame me if I get shot.Since the beasts escaped, you have been my source of strength, she said.You kept everything under control.But now you need to be honest with me.I need to know whats happening.You cant keep me in the dark.Why did you save me?he asked.She paused, and looked away.Why did you save me down in Section Six, the day the beasts broke out?Again she said nothing, attempting to blank out the memory.When the alarm had first gone off, shed made for the barracks along with everyone else.But upon realising that neither Lesper nor Kramer was there, she charged down to Section Six.There she found no guards, only blood.Kramer turned to the screen on the wall and switched it back on to reveal security footage of Section Six.She watched him cowering against the wall, sparks flying, and one of them towering over him.Then she saw herself enter the room, pick up one of the fallen coils, and fire at the beast.She merely stunned it, but it gave them enough time to get out.I dont know why I saved you, she said.But I cant imagine wed have survived without you.Someone had to make the decisions youve made.You kept everything under control.You kept us alive.Kramer stood and slowly walked to the window out of which the very edge of Tempest Beta could be seen, before turning and looking her in the eye.Human beings grow up believing that the world around them is a product of themselves, when in actual fact it is the other way around.They are slaves to the world around them.No matter how much we learn or how far we progress, as long as man continues to believe he is the one in control then control is the one thing man will never have.Ive always trusted you, she said.When everyone else didnt, I saw you knew what you were doing.But ...But you dont believe in my decision to send the captain down with the bait?Honestly, she said, no.Well, you were right, he said.I did always know what I was doing.And with that he moved quickly back across the room, sat back down, and fluently keyed something into the computer.I sent those people down there, along with the captain, because there is no way we can take them all with us.Nor can I risk another attack from the beasts.By sacrificing them, the demons will be kept below, deep among the catacombs.Ketrass moved to stand behind him.But why?Because, he said, not looking up, in times of crisis the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few.Thousands of years of history have taught us that.What the hell do you mean, times of crisis?There is room on the Chaos for everyone!Yes, my dear, but youre assuming I mean to escape and head for civilization.Where else would we go?What if I told you we could never return home?Then youd have to give me a damn good reason why!Kramer didnt respond and continued typing into the computer.Let me tell you a story, he said.A story?Watch the screen, Avne.She looked up and yet more security footage materialised.It showed a man, running through the station corridors, frantically looking behind and above him.Is that ...Lesper, he said.Yes.Our brave commander, after releasing the beasts and leaving me down in Section Six, proceeded to the dock and stole the Nyx.Yes, we know that.Well the story doesnt end there.Keep watching.Another camera was accessed, and she gasped, shivers trickling down her spine, as something large and dark moved through the corridors in the same direction as Lesper.Toward the dock.One of them followed him?Kramer didnt reply.All right, she said.Let me get this straight.You found these ...creatures, down in the Labyrinth.You brought, what, fifteen of them up?Fifteen, yes.Then proceeded to study them.Indeed.But the other ...Subject Sixteen ...you created it yourself.Yes, Avne.Using whom?Our old captain.Captain Berenguer.What?!Kramer twitched, but said nothing.Dathlan Berenguer was a good man.He didnt deserve  No one deserved what happened to him.But it was necessary.You keep telling yourself that!The Professor twisted back to his screen.The footage went off.Another image sprang up.A strange image.Is that  A satellite projection?he said.Yes, it is.A reading from our station scanner directed at the planet below.And thats a ...a personnel beacon?It is indeed.There was no need to explain who this particular beacon belonged to.Its Lesper, she said.The Nyx is down there, down on Tempest Beta.Precisely.Ketrass took a deep breath.Subject Sixteen followed him onto the Nyx and he ended up down there.But I dont understand.Could Lesper be alive?The reading confirms he is in fact dead, he said.But the beacons continuing regardless.Something is charging it.But thats not the interesting part.Lesper once told me he feared the true keepers of this place had never left.Kramer rewound the recording of the beacons position so that it read some days ago.I discovered the beacon two days after the attack, as I was widening the search to see if I could find a beacon within Erebus, around the periphery of the Labyrinth.I found nothing there, but instead happened upon this.The date on the screen read just after the attack, then advanced another day, and  Hell no!Ketrass cried, staring at the screen, mesmerised.Youre joking.H ...How?Who knows?Kramer said with an excited though somewhat anxious grin.But I have my theories.He played the recording again.Ketrass could not understand it, but guessed what it meant.She placed the pistol down onto the table and walked forward, watching the pulsating beacon inside the Nyx, staring as it moved across the screen, hauled by something incredibly large and powerful across the stormy surface of Tempest Beta, through and into a patch of unnerving darkness, where it disappeared.Somethings down there.Sixty Eight      The three sat panting in a closed off room, the kindled coilbolt immersing their uneasy expressions in a red burning blaze under which Ferranti hastily obstructed the windowed door, Justus lay on a nearby table, and Anna sat with her knees tucked into her chest in the darkest corner she could find.Justus held up the flickering coil and attempted to work the circular comm device he had found within his jacket.Anna watched him hold the comm up high and the palm sized metal plate buzzed into life.A connection was made as the sound of static filled the small space.Is it working?she asked.Only one way to find out.Justus flicking the toggle, held the contraption high, and said, Araman ...Araman, its Antal.Are you there?A moment of overwrought quiet followed, then:  Im here.Justus breathed out heavily.Thank peace, he said.Araman, you have to help ...the beasts are down here with us!We dont know where the others are  I know, Araman replied.Stay calm.I will help you.I knew you wouldnt betray me, he said.Dont be silly!Now listen: Ketrass and I are going to deal with Kramer.But theyve completely destroyed the elevator shaft.I didnt know he would do that.So what do we do?Its impossible to get back up that way unless youre one of those creatures, and the very last thing you want is to get caught in between.Okay, Justus said, attempting to remain calm and composed.What other way back up is there?Another moment of silence.There is no accessible way up this side of the station.Anna slumped to the ground.Justus lowered the coil, dropped the comm onto the table, and put his head in his hand.Hopeless.Antal ...there are two ways down into Erebus.Section Six!Justus cried.Quiet!said Ferranti from beside the obstructed door.No noise.Justus nodded and picked the comm back up.Section Six.Isnt there another way?Im afraid not, Araman said.Thats your only chance.That side hasnt been blocked off?It has been blocked off, yes.But from what I gather only the top side barricade is still there.I can try and destroy it, leaving only one obstacle in your path.What obstacle?Anna asked.A lamenting sigh carried from the comm, filling the room.Well have to go through the Black Labyrinth, Justus said, trembling as he said it.Listen, said Araman.I have to go.Things are not good up here.Make your way through the Labyrinth.Its your only chance.Okay.Good luck up there.Oh, Antal ...Yeah?Take your coilbolt.And he was gone.Justus glanced up at the other two; he looked just as bewildered and frightened as Anna felt.Whats the Black Labyrinth?Ferranti asked.Its ...Its what they call the inside of this asteroid ...the maze of rock beneath us.Therere two ways down there.Were above one.The other is in Section Six, the other side of the station.If were going to get out we have no choice but to go through it.If their plans are right theres a chance itll bring us up on the other side  With those things out there looking for us?Anna cried.I dont think so!Youd prefer to stay here and wait for them to come back for us?he said.Which they will.Anna did not reply.Truth be told she did want to stay and let the creatures come back for her.There was no way to get out; and crawling down towards them in the dark sounded worse than her nightmares.All she wanted was Glana back.If thats the only way, then thats where well go, Ferranti said, and he reached for the cupboard to begin sliding it from in front of the door.He was so tough, so strong; she wished she could have that kind of strength.Theres just one thing, Justus said.Our power doesnt work down there ...among the labyrinth.Electricity, battery ...none of it does for very long.I dont know how well be able to see a thing, never mind figure out where were going.What about this?Anna asked, remembering the small swiss knife Ferranti had given her for her birthday; she reached down into her boot and lifted it out, flicking on the tiny torch to light the room.Justus looked at it carefully.Some kind of battery power?Old?Yes, Ferranti said.I doubt itll work.Ketrass ...my friend told me batteries run out quick.The one and only time Ive been down there my torch went off almost right away.But if we take it, Ferranti said, theres always a chance, however small, right?I suppose ...Then lets get moving.We dont have much time.You said theyll leave soon.Within an hour or two.Hopefully Araman will be able to hold them up.Ferranti nodded.No time to waste then.* * *  The three started out, Justus coil lighting the way as he led them lower and deeper.Anna treaded carefully, creeping in the middle of the two captains.Only their breath was audible in the silence, alongside their slow footsteps and the hum of the coil.Not long after moving off, they reached another elevator hatch.This isnt going to be easy, Justus said.Theres another shaft here.Its the only way down.Anna sighed.She couldnt do it.Its longer than the other, and well have to climb down.Climb?she said.Unless you can think of a way to operate the elevator, he said, well have to use the ladders.Im not saying itll be easy.But its probably safer.Less noise, less chance of drawing attention.I cant.Look, Ferranti said, annoyance in his voice.We dont have a choice anymore.You want to get back to your sister?Of course I do!Then we have to trust him.Come on, I wont let anything happen to you.Anna knew he was lying.If those things, whatever they were, found them, then they were all as good as dead.But, in his attempt to comfort her, he had reminded her of the only reason she might possibly be able to do it: Glana.
