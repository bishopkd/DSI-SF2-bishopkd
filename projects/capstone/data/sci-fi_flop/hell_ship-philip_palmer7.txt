Despair indeed might prove to be the best of my options.Do you see what this mean?Sharrock said.Of course I do, I said, calmly, hiding my terror.Then we must Wait.We have to We have to wait.Let me think.He sneered.I get it.Youre afraid.You I expanded, five fold, in an instant, and fired my quills at the trees that lined our path, and they were impaled and screamed          in agony, for they were sentient trees and I had not realised.And I howled, a low howl.Sai ias I am afraid, I conceded.If I were a biped, my face would have been moist.I am afraid.Afraid.Afraid.Afraid.I had lived for so many centuries without rage, without a thirst for vengeance, and without any trace or remnant or shadow          of hope.And now I realised I was afraid of it; I was afraid of hope.I made Sharrock pledge to keep silent.And I did not visit him for another twelve cycles, while I brooded about the problem:          what to do about the Tower?I walked up from the woods, past the seas of fire.Shoals of Bala Birds flew above mea single gestalt mind in the bodies          of a million tiny insects that flocked like shadows in the air.I saw the arboreals playing, flying from branch to branch with the aid of their prehensile tails, or in some cases prehensile teeth          or noses.I half walked, half slid on my carapace segments past the shore of the lake where Sharrock and I had eaten false fish, and          I saw the charred remnants of a bonfire.And then I saw Sharrock, squatted on a tree trunk, eating cooked meat.He sensed me before he saw me, and turned, and looked          at me enquiringly.Sharrock, I said to him, Let us explore that fucking Tower.The sun was setting beautifully over the lake.The Tower was etched in silhouette against the richly red sky.Then the lights went out.Sharrock was tethered to my back, and I swam across to the waters of the lake.It was totally black now; not even a glimmer          of light intruded, and there were no heat signatures to guide me.So I simply swam blind using my sense of motion to keep          us on a dead straight line across the lake.Sharrock murmured encouraging words to me, which gave me precious little encouragement; indeed, he was starting to make me          feel like his beast of burden.The waters lapped around us.I found it disorientating to have no way of locating myself by          my surroundings.I tried uttering a few shrill shrieks to see if I could echo locate by them, but that wasnt one of my best          senses and sound, of course, doesnt really travel so well at night in this place.So we simply carried on until I crashed into an invisible barrier.I crumpled, and rolled over in the waters, and splashed and spluttered myself into a floating position.Sharrock stayed balanced          on my body, unperturbed and undampened.This is it, said Sharrock, contributing nothing but the accentuation of the obvious.I patted the barrier with two of my tentacles, and felt a sticky, soft surface.The force projection field.Proximity alarm has gone off, said Sharrock; his hearing was most unnaturally acute, for I had heard nothing.I feel rain, Sharrock added; I was too wet by then to tell.But I could hear the wind start to spring up.Then Sharrock gripped me tight, holding me by my eye fronds, the ends of which he had tied to his stomach like ropes; and          I dived down.And down further, pawing the invisible wall with my clawssavouring the joy of water on my soft skin, an atavistic          memory of life as a sea creature running through my veinsuntil suddenly the force wall was gone.I was near the muddy bottom of the lake, and I ploughed a path through the mud and mess.Then my way was blocked by rock,          as we struck the lake bed itself; but I tore at the rock with my claws, burrowing a way through, with Sharrock clinging on          to me.After we had tunnelled for ten minutes or more through rock and mud, I aimed my body upwards; until we were in water          once again.We were, I was confident, now on the other side of the force shield barrier.Swiftly, I kicked and splashed, using air from my gills to propel me through the water to the surface.And we broke the waters          soft barrier of tension and emerged into the air.Sharrock gasped for breath, but appeared unharmed by our long time underwater;          and I marvelled at the remarkable capacity, for a land creature, of his lungs.Now, I said, and Sharrock turned on the searchlight that Quipu had constructed, using parts of hull and metallic ore from          the mountains.And the world was lit up: the Tower, looming above us, the purple grasses all around, and the brooding crag          of the Towers rocky mount.I hear it, said Sharrock.The second alarm.Wait, its stopped.This happened last time too.Which means        What?Soon, the storms will really start to rage.We paddled to shore.The beach was lit by our searchlight.A gust of wind struck us, and I tucked Sharrock in a tentacle to          keep him safe from the gale, and we looked around for the giant metal beast, but saw none such.As we had hoped, it was a          creature that stalked the day, not the night.Then we continued on.We made our way up from the beach and Sharrock walked on my wind sheltered side while I slithered towards the Tower, still          following the light of Sharrocks torch.The Tower was close.There were no more force barriers.We reached a gate, and I          tried to crawl over it and failed, so I smashed it down.Then we reached the Tower, and entered through a stone gateway.We          were inside the Tower now.We were inside it.The Tower at such close quarters had a delicate beauty that surprised me; it was made of silver brick that shone with newness,          and the coloured glass windows were decorated with scenes of biped heroism etched with stunning artistry.But the interior          was barrenno rooms, no furniture, no people.We explored the Tower, which was a vast complex of interlocking rooms the size of a city; but possessed of no furnishings,          and no inhabitants.We trailed down empty corridors; stood within vast empty banqueting rooms; marvelled at the empty basements          and the barren upstairs rooms which had no dcor and had never been inhabited.This place was not and never had been lived          in; it was certainly not the control centre from which the Kaun steered and controlled the ship.I dont understand, I said at last.Sharrock uttered a sharp sound; a laugh mixed with mockery.Its a trick, said Sharrock.We use them in warfare all the time.Fake cities.Illusionary battalions.The Metal Giant too, thats illusion.I saw it walk on to the beach the other day,          over those purple grasses.But the grass there is intact and still high; no creature has walked here in many years.The Metal          Giant is not real, its just a visual projection.More trickery.But to what end?I asked.Self preservation, Sharrock explained.You all believe the Kaun live in this Tower.And if that were actually true, you          might conceivably have found a way to beat their godsforsaken force field, and then swept through this place and destroyed          them all.But these monsters are not stupid monsters.Theyre not here, theyre elsewhere.Safe.Guarded.Where?I dont know, admitted Sharrock.But do you see what this proves?I thought, long and hard and strategically.No, I admitted.Theyre afraid, said Sharrock.I do not comprehend.Why hide, if they could so easily defeat you?Theyre afraid.Of you.Their own slaves.And that means, said Sharrock, that if we ever can find the fucking corpse sucking bastards, we stand a chance of defeating          them.We left the Tower.The wind by now had risen to a frenzy, and rain was pouring in torrents from the clouds above.Though this          rain did not actually land on usit merely splattered on to the force projection field above us in the air.But the winds were actually here, inside the dome shaped field of force; and we knew that the Kaun were using their air as a weapon against us.We should, I suggested, go.The journey back was harder.The storm was exceedingly powerful, and I had to fight every step of the way to return to the          islands pebbly beach.Sharrock was unable to stand against the gale, so I held him in my tentacle; but even I could barely          propel myself against the walls of wind that enveloped me.And bizarrely the winds could change direction; no matter which          way I turned, I was battling against the wind.Eventually however we reached the beach and I dived back into the waters of the lake, which were wildly turbulent.And then          dived to the bottom and returned along the crude tunnel I had ripped out of the lake bed, that took us under the force wall.And once when we were back upon the lake itself, the tides were still against us, and were ferociously powerful; it took almost          all my strength to swim against tide and wind in the direction of the land.However a mere storm had no power to hurt me; and Sharrock was by now hugged tight against my chest, protected from it all.As I swam, I thought about the Tower, and the pathetic deception the Kaun had practised against us; and I began to see Sharrocks          point.Now, for the first time in all my years on this ship, the Kaun did not seem to me to be all powerful.Perhaps they          really could be        My thoughts were savagely interrupted, for the gales intensified and became a tornado; and spiralling currents of air caught          us up and threw us into the air.And we were flying now, higher and faster and higher still; and then we crashed against the          hard surface that I knew was the roof of our world.The impact shocked me, I began to fall, Sharrock by now was just clinging          on numbly, unable to speak.I tried again to right myself, and glide; but I was spun in a helical path by winds so powerful they threatened to rip the          cape off my body.So instead I flattened my cape against myself and made myself as streamlined as I could, as if I were swimming through the deep ocean.And I allowed the winds to lift me up, and dash me          down, and crash me from all sides.And so, all night long, we flew in the midst of a hurricane, deafened, unable to see, battered this way and that.Then, when the sun arose, the storm started to abate.And I went into a free fall.At the last moment I managed to spread          my cape and we glided safely down to the mainland.Sharrock was unconscious, though alive; his clothes had been torn from his body and his skin had been ripped from his back.I could see the white bone of his spine.His supporting frond tether had broken; but even so, he had managed to cling on to          me and never let go.I carried him to the well of life and lay him down there and rolled him in.The blue waters turned red and Sharrock spluttered.But I made him lie in the healing waters until the skin on his back had grown back, and his broken bones were beginning to          heal.So where are they?I asked.Sharrock smiled, as if he knew something that I didnt.Its a total mystery to me, I confessed.The Kaun do not dwell in the Tower; they are not under the lake; they do not          exist in the mountains or the Valley.I know every inch of this world!Where are they?And Sharrock pointed up, to the clear blue sky.Up there.Beyond the sky.That is their world, said Sharrock.Beyond the sky is space, I protested.A second hull.Its the only explanation.He drew the shape in the sand: a circle surrounded by a larger circle.Picture          this: we dwell in the interior world; but above and around us here is the exterior world, where the ship is controlled, and          where the Kaun make their home.I looked at the shape:  We are a world within a world, I said, marvelling.Yes, said Sharrock.And all we have to do is find a way through to the exterior world that exists between our sky and the          ships hull, where dwell the Kaun.And then we shall        Slay the evil bastards?I suggested.Slay, agreed Sharrock, those evil world killing bastards.Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer You should stop now.Stop reading Jak.Read no more.Its not helping you.You cannot I have to know.No purpose is being served.You are merely I have to honour them.Every one.Every creature lost, I must at least know the name of its species, and one fact at least             about it.Is that too much to ask?That one fact about an entire species will be remembered for all eternity.That will drive you mad.Again.Jak?Jak?In this archive are riches from the multiverses; for ever gone.EXPLORER 410: DATA ARCHIVE           LOG OF LOST CIVILISATIONS (EXTRACT) Lost Civilisation: 12,443 SPECIES: The Dia MORPHOLOGY: Unknown, but small in size  a formidable database listing every single species on every single planet explored by these remarkable sentients.The full database is archived here; it goes into minute and sometimes pedantic detail (twelve million categories of dotted markings upon skin) and does not             include any useful description of the Dias own form, shape, and nature.Highlights from the database of species known to the Dia include: Kaolka: small toad like creatures that could leap up into the clouds and eat birds with a single gulp (on the planet D12132             if mapped according to Olaran model of stellographyDia name not translatable).Shoshau: creatures made of slime without internal organs or eyes or ears who moved by binary fission and competed for land             with vast flocks of aerials whose urine was toxic to the slime beasts (on the planet Ff991).The Shoshau had, apparently,             a song that was astonishingly sweet.Seaira: translucent land animals whose internal organs were clearly visible and who could soar like bats, and could focus             sunlight as a lens to use as a weapon against predators (on the planet D9980).Bararrrrs: Insect like creatures that lived for centuries and grew to the size of small rodents, then grew to be vast amphibious             creatures, then carried on growing and ossifying until they became mountains; these mountains then served as nests for new             generations of insects (on the planet R88).Though the morphology of the Dia themselves was never defined, several clues indicate they were small, and unaggressive.1 Lost Civilisation: 22,399 SPECIES: Unknown MORPHOLOGY: Unknown Language of message untranslatable, but coherence patterns indicate it originated as an electromagnetic signal.As with 67.2             per cent of all messages, the lack of a hermeneutic prime number/alphabetical symbol/significant images key page makes it             impossible to read the message.Lost Civilisation: 33,445 SPECIES: Kaaaala.MORPHOLOGY: Not specified but aquatic origin implies limbs that are evolved from fins.This species left many messages caught in the folds of space, but this lament is the most haunting:  Our planet is dying.Our people are dying.We are the last of our kind, and we are truly cursed by our own foul nature.Yesterday I saw a mob erupt and kill a pregnant                female and rip her embryo from her womb and trample it into the dust.Such a horror appalled me but I know it is typical of                our times.Such outbursts of violence are hardly new.Weve all read our history books, and we know about the city riots of the sixth                century and the country riots of the twelfth century and the class riots of the thirteenth century.Our history books are little more than a litany of murders, wars and mass uprisings                in which the death toll can often reach the millions.Why are we such a barbarous species?Are we unique, in all this universe, in being cursed to kill our own kind?Some commentators blame the corruption of technology and science for our woes.And it is true that the invention of the projectile                bomb, the road side bomb and the extendable dagger have wrought havoc among our youth and our elders.My own grandfather slew                a hundred innocent children when he rampaged through his former school with a multi projectile gun and body armour.His age rage                was typical; our kind seem to evolve out of riotous youth into a tranquil middle age, only to descend once more into vicious                anarchy once we are past the age of sixty years.But the death rate was even higher back in the long gone Old Days, even though knives and swords and axes were used instead                of rockets and mortars and projectile guns.The streets ran purple with blood on so many occasions; and traitors and innocents                alike were punished by the law by the most cruel methods, including beheading, eviscerating and [NOT KNOWN].The biological determinists believe that our cruel nature is the result of our distant origins as aquatic creatures of the                great oceans.For we are used to spawning, and shoaling, and dying en masse in the teeth of vicious sea predators.A million                of our eggs will yield ten million or more children as they hatch in the nursery muds and we are accustomed to allowing nature                itself to determine which of those children shall have parentsin other words, we let them fight it out until only the strongest                new born embryos survive.Perhaps there are other species who do not practise such a barbaric form of early nurture, who place more value upon the lives                of their children.We are born to bloodshed, eating alive our brothers and sisters in order to survive.Is it any wonder that                blood lust remains with us all our days?There are deists, however, who believe we are dying as a species because we have been cursed by an unknown, omniscient creator,                who spawned all the eggs of life and is now waiting gleefully to see which intelligent species will live, and which will die.We are pawns of a playful god, in other words, waiting to see if we live or die and not caring either way.When I was a young one I dreamed of travelling into space and discovering alien forms of life and being an explorer.Now,                it is unlikely I will live beyond my sixtieth birthday.For the mobs are using hydrogen fission weapons to attack their enemies;                the end is surely not far off.We will kill each other off with our new bombs; we will destroy ourselves as surely as we destroyed                our enemies.And if the world does survivewhat do we have to look forward to?A slow decline into vicious, violent, gangsterish brutality?Will I end up murdering my own children, as so many of my older friends have done?What savages we are!If there are other intelligent species out there, then I thank my blessings we never encountered them; for they would be ashamed                of us.We are natures runt; the worst, most violent species ever spawned.We do not deserve to live.One year after this message was broadcast to the stars, the Death Ship appeared in the skies above these peoples planet.The Dreaded were hailed as saviours, and a new spirit of cooperation spread through the lands of these once aquatic peoples.Violence ceased.The elderly mellowed, and realised the folly of their brutal ways.The children learned to respect their             elders, awed and shamed by the presence of alien sentient life.The Dreaded were welcomed by these people with open arms, and according to several broadcasts transmitted to the stars, they             were acclaimed almost as gods.There is no record however of how this species and its planet were destroyed by the Dreaded; but destroyed they were, along             with the rest of this universe.All that remains is a lament by a sentient being ashamed of his own people for all their flaws             and frailties; and, as Star Seeker Jak has ironically observed, unaware that that there are other creatures in existence who             take evil to infinitely greater extremes.Hell Ship           Sharrock           I have a tale to tell, I said.It was Day the Fourth, a day for poetry and tall tales.And I held all those gathered before mewho comprised almost all the          sentients of the interior world except for the Kindred, and the sessiles, the aquatics and the plantswith my fierce gaze.A tale of adventure and courage; duplicity; guile; alien artefacts; and beautiful jewels, I continued, and I knew I had          their rapt attention, for such is my way with words.For I stole a precious stone for my beloved wife Malisha, from the treasure          house in the palace of the Galli, the chief family of the Southern Tribes in the city of Sabol on the planet of Markdsi.It          was a jewel that had previously been stolen by the Galli from an alien species of peerless power.And I stole it from the          thieves; for those effete Southerners could not keep it from me!And here is the jewel.And I held it in my hand; a beauteous red stone, which shone like a furnace in the dim candle light.I stole it for her, for my beloved wife Malisha, I continued.And, after fleeing Sobol in a small spaceship, I was pursued          and then captured by soldiers of the Southern Tribes.But I kept the gem safe by hiding it in my mouth, in the place of a          tooth which I had ripped out.Then I escaped, and stole another spaceship.I survived a space battle.I was marooned for many months when my craft was          trapped in waves of energy that prevented all means of propulsion, a doldrums of deep space.I saw, or thought I saw, space          ghosts.All these adventures I briefly mention here; they were to be the matter of a glorious tale to be told by the fireside          late one night, to my naked and sated and beauteous wife.Yet this never happened.The tale was never told; for Malisha died, terribly.My daughter Sharil died.My people died.I          came to this place and I found brave and noble souls, yourselves.And I commend you all for your spirit; I am proud to know          you.But all this is mere preamble, to set the scene, and acquaint you with the character of the storys protagonist, namelymyself.The tale I tell today is this: One day on the ship called Hell, a decision was made.One fateful day changed the destiny          of all.One day all the peoples of the ship resolved to work together; not to fall into Despair, but to work together with          one aim.And that aim is: to comprehend this place and how we are kept here and why we are kept here.And to use this knowledge to destroy our enemy, and to escape our captivity.That is the tale I have to tell; except I cannot tell it, for it has not yet happened.If we succeed, then shall I speak          more.Who will join me?When I had finished speaking, I looked at Sai ias.I knew what such a course of action would mean to her.It would be the          repudiation of all her dreams of peace and contentment; the destruction of the equilibrium she had so painstakingly achieved;          and the beginning of a vicious and merciless war which in all likelihood none of us would survive.I will join you!Sai ias roared, and relief swept over me; and all voices were raised to celebrate the dream of liberty          I had conjured up this day.There was much work to be done, and many nonsensical notions to be discarded to help us to achieve our aims.For instance: translating air!The very idea was absurd.There was no technology I could conceive of that could allow air to translate, on a long term and universal basis.Miniature mechanoids floating in the air equipped with databrains and a          translator code could do it of course, for a brief while.But what mechanism would be used to convey the translation into          the mind of the listener?It would be sheerest chance to swallow the one portion of air that contained the translation of          the words we were hearing!Whats more, in the course of time, these mini mechanoids would be dispersed by the winds.So to create air that translates,          youd need as many mini mechanoids as there were molecules of oxygen in the atmosphere!Idiocy!In the same way, all the creatures on this world had succumbed to the absurd notion that the Tower was the home of the Kaun.They were sure it must be truefor the Tower was remote, yet visible; protected by winds; a constant reminder to them of the Kauns power.But what warrior would put his army in plain sight of the enemy like that?Did these creatures know nothing of subterfuge          and military strategy?Sai ias and I had proved that the Tower was nothing but a myth; but it was one of many.For, as I now argued to the peoples of the Hell Ship, this notion that air could translate was also a mythby which I mean a superstition which idiots believe in because they are too stupid to think for themselves.(On Maxolu,          we have no superstition; that is why we are so superior to the feeble minded Southerners with their cult of the Inner God,          which to my mind is nothing but an excuse for gluttony!)Be that as it may: another Hell Ship myth was that the air somehow creates the light from the sun.But how?Tired air becomes          the sunsetabsurd!Why not use a hidden light source?Or place bulbs on the other side of the metal sky, and use mirrors to          convey the light within?These creatures of the interior world wanted to believe such lies.They could not face the truth; that solutions to problems are usually simple, sensible, and pragmatic.It was now my job to teach these creatures to discount all these myths and delusions, in order to defeat the Kaun.The myth          of the air; the myth of the light; the myth of eternal life.All nonsense!Teaching the citizens of the Hell Ship to see the world clearly and as it really is; that was my first part of my mission.I killed Zala, I said to them all, in the battle of the End of Days.So how could she have survived her terrible injuries,          and come to live with you once more?A pause ensued; my listeners did not see the reason for the question, but I waited patiently.It was not the real Zala, suggested Morok, but a replica.A machine replica?I asked, encouragingly.In our world, said Tubu, we had such creations.But they werent machines, they were illusions, solid to the touch.It could be, I said.And remember, the real Zala had no memory of her fight with me; and no trace of a scar where I beheaded          her.The memories of those who fight the Kaun are erased, Morok pointed out.Not always, Sai ias said.Sometimes the Kindred remember what they do; forgetting only occurs when their injuries are severe,          as Zalas were.That may be it, I said, pleased with Sai iass astute comment.For I utterly destroyed her body: I split the head and brain;          and cut her torso into parts; even the waters of the well of life could not bring that to life.Agreed.Rejuvenation of cells, said Quipu One, can explain the healing of most injuries; but some other force must be at          work in the case of Zala.Could it be, asked Iodoy, connected with blink technology?Explain, I asked, intrigued.It is possible to conjure a creature from here, to here, clarified Quipu Two, in the blink of an eye.Hence the phrase.My people used it as a means of conveying cargo from one planet to another.We called it gapping, Iodays people called          it blinking.We and Ioday have discussed the science of it often.But such a method of transport only works if you create          a perfect replica of the creature during the process; for it is information that is gapped, not matter itself.The silence was stony; then it yielded fruit.That must be it; that is the technology they are using, I said excitedly.For Zala blinked away from my planet.She faded,          then went.I thought of it as magic; but replication and disreality bonding could have achieved the same effect.Indeed, added Quipu One.When she arrived on your planet they would have had a second Zala in storage.A perfect recording          of the original creature; any mechanoid brain with sufficient data storage capacity could do that.Thats how they make us cheat death!Replication, coupled with rejuvenation, said Quipu Two.Making us both immortal, and          unkillable.What about the water of the well of life?said Ioday.Perhaps, began Quipu One.Perhaps it contains healing particles, Quipu Two interrupted, excitedly.Miniature mechanoid brains, that interact with          the cells of our body, using small worlds technology.Our kind had that, I admitted.Once, our people used to die of heart attacks and alcohol poisoning, in vast numbers; but          that has not been the case for many years.For at birth now, we are injected with artificial cells with micro brains that          live in our body and clean our body of toxins.In consequence, I added proudly, we can drink gallons of the strongest ale,          and never get drunk, nor suffer any dismal pangs the following morn!And so it went on; I badgered these foolish beasts to think harder and longer about the powers of the creatures who built our world than they had ever done before.The next day dawned: Day the First.Once again, our peoples of the Hell Ship travelled their world.But this time, I asked Sai ias to gather all the aquatics          together and dive deep and plumb the depths of the lake; and then dig deep holes in the lake bed itself to test what lay beneath.And I asked the aerials to flock high and peck at every patch of the false sky, looking for gaps, or joins, or weaknesses.I told Fray to smash holes in the mountains, to create caves out of sheer rock, in the hope of finding an entryway to the          exterior hull by that route.I told Quipu to analyse the soil, and examine the water from the well of life with his telescopic visions to ascertain what          microbes might exist there.Everything was recorded; written by Lardoi in blank books taken from Quipus library, and also memorised by Quipus five brains.And Lirilla flew from place to place, carrying information, cajoling, unifying us into a single exploratory force.Day the Second.The Temple was getting close to the sky now; but instead of demolishing it, I made the workers continue building          the structure up higher, yet narrower.Until the Temple was a thin finger that reached close enough to touch the sky.And those working on the Temple continued past the end of Day the Second, and for many cycles after; until the Tower near          touched the sky.At which point Fray clambered up the high steps and took a perch up there; and began to butt the hull metal with her powerful horns.Relentlessly, incessantly, powerfully.It seemed to make no impression; but she continued, and continued, and I          knew she would do so until I told her to stop.And after six days, a dent in the roof of the sky was visible.Day the Third.As the work on the Temple continued, I began each Day the Third by making the aerials practise swooping and ripping with sharp          beaks.I trained the giant sentients to charge in tight formation; I taught military tactics to the arboreals.I forced Sai ias          to prove her strength by throwing sessiles as missiles.The aquatics too were marshalled, and asked to demonstrate their predatory          techniques, their killing skills.And the land predators practised their most basic survival skill; how to hunt.Day the Fourth.A day of tales, and poetry.And on this day, each poet was asked by me to imagine a world in which all sentient          beings lived in harmony, and the Kaun were dead.And then to write their visions up into poems that would inspire us all!Day the Fifth.Day the Sixth.Day the Seventh.Day the Eighth.Day the Ninth The days began to blur.Some explored, some built the Temple, some trained in warfare strategies and honed their fighting          skills.And others spent all their time discussing the science of the Kaun and the geography of our world.Each part of the interior          world was to be charted; each creature in the interior world was to prepare for what by now we all knew was inevitable: full scale war against the Kaun.Thus had I turned these creatures into an army fit to vanquish the most fierce of enemies.And I had also made them think.Just as, in her own exceptional way, Sai ias had made me think.For I had been so very certain, for all my life, that the way of my people was the rightest and most apt way.But now I had          come to doubt it all.All the values I had assumed and trusted and relied uponI now challenged them, utterly.War is glory?Death is the supreme achievement for a warrior?Prowess in a duel is a sign of moral superiority?All these beliefs now seemed to mewell, fatuous really.War may be necessary; military might may be prudent; but there really are, it now dawned on me, more important things in life.Thus had Sai ias taught me; for my mind too, I realised, had been cluttered with myths.Blind and foolish beliefs that could          not withstand the cool stare of compassion.In comparable fashion, the creatures on this ship assumed they knew the truth about their world; but they did not.Their assumptions were false; their beliefs were absurd.Thus had they been, for so many years, and in every respect, the dupes of the evil Kaun.I had one final surprise for them.We were sitting, a small group of usSai ias, Quipu, Fray, Lirilla, Doro, and Iin the fields by the forest, in the warm sun.Doro was a shadow on the grass, we barely knew he was there.But he was always there.Fray was restless, but determined to          listen to my words.Quipu was animated, gesticulating with his two hands and bobbing his five heads as he mentally wrestled          with thorny problems about the physics of the Hell Ship.I then discussed with them my various theories.You have told me that for many years you have believed the air translates, I said, preparing the ground for my argument.And it also hears every word we say.Correct, that was indeed once our belief, said Quipu Three.And it allows us all to breathe, though the atmospheres of our planets are very different.Correct again, Quipu One concurred.And the Tower is the home of the Kaun; and the air generates light; and creatures who fall into Despair live for all eternity?All fallacies, we see that now, conceded Quipu One.Yet youve already said all this!chided Quipu Three.Dont be discourteous, said Quipu Five, critically.Let the creature speak, ordered Quipu Four.Even if he is annoyingly repetitious, Quipu Two sniped.My point now is: how do we know all this?I asked.Baffled stares greeted me.But this was the crux of it!All on the Hell Ship lived their lives according to various beliefsor, as I would term them, myths.But where did these fucking myths come from?Quipu shrugged, five foldly.These are things we simply know, Quipu One said.And Quipu Two added: Some knowledge is like that.Geometry, the difference between up and down, mathematics.It is called innate knowledge.Is there any other kind?Sai ias asked; and I marvelled once more at the oddness of her mind.Innate knowledge, that turns out to be utterly false?I pointed out gently.The Quipus took my point.But Lirilla, Fray, Doro and Sai ias still had no notion what I was driving at.Another question: Why have slaves?I continued.I dont understand what you mean, said Fray, irascibly.If they were really all powerful, I argued, the Kaun wouldnt need you to fight their godsforsaken battles.They have          technology.They have weapons.But they are few.Remember that.And they are cowering from us now, afraid.They pondered my words, and saw the sense.Then I waited a few moments more.There is something else, said Sai ias, astutely, that you want to explain to us.Isnt there?I smiled.Let me show you, instead.They journeyed with me to the mountains; and from there I led them into a cavern in the rock.The cavern was wide, but even          so Sai ias had to compress her body five fold to get through.Quipu followed, agile on his five legs, Fray lumbered after          him; Lirilla flew ahead; while I leaped confidently from rock to rock.And there we found an underground waterfall, spilling out of the mountain.This is the source, I said, of the well of the water of life.And I took a knife and gouged a line in my arm.Blood flowed;          then I dipped the arm in the water.When I removed it, the cut was healed instantly, without so much as a delay of a few seconds.Then I reached into the water and pulled out a large sack.I opened the sack.Inside the sack was one of the brains of Djamrock, sundered into many parts, but still pulsing as it had when it was alive.What is this?Sai ias asked, shocked.I retrieved it, I said, fromI do not care to elaboratefrom the leavings of Cuzco that werevoidedafter he killed Djamrock,          and before he was banished.This is the brain of Djamrock, or parts of it.I prodded the flesh of the brain segments with          a finger; it throbbed.The cells are alive, though Djamrocks mind is dead.But the flesh, you see, doesnt rot.What have you done?said Sai ias, in appalled tones.I am performing an experiment, I told her sharply.Into the nature of our captivity.The dead shards of brain pulsed, eerily; the mood of my listeners had turned dark and sombre.But I ignored the bleak mood          and continued.Facts and myths, I said.Let us consider them in turn.The first myth: we on the ship cannot die.Not true; Djamrock was killed and now he is dead; these are merely cell samples.You believe his consciousness lives on in his sundered body?I ask you, what evidence do you have for that?It is just a belief,          a superstition.Let us discount it.The second myth; the air translates.Who told you that?No one.How do you know it then?Because some things are just known,          like geometry?Thats one possibility, but it makes little sense.So think about this, I said, softly, letting my words enter their minds like a whisper on the breeze.What if the thought          were planted in your head.Like a whisper, on the breeze.A thought that says: The air you breathe can translate your every          word.Easily done.A thought, in the head?Its impossible, said Quipu.In my civilisation, I said, we have a thing called a pakla, inserted into the brains of each of us.It allows us to communicate          at a distance.And we can use the pakla to translate.You program it with data about the languages involved, and it turns          alien speech automatically into words I understand.I have used it often thus.Pakla?asked Quipu One.Thats our name for what you call a smallworlds mechanoid mind, and some of the creatures on this ship callwell, whatever.Its convergent evolution at work; many species have achieved the same technological breakthroughs.Not mine, Sai ias said.We have no use for mechanical brains.Nor ours, said Quipu One.We remember every fact we encounter; numbers are like music to us; we could not create a machine          cleverer than I.         Or I, added Quipu Two, competitively.Watch this, I said, and I teased apart the shards of Djamrocks brain with a knife until a small crystal was visible.I gouged the crystal out and showed them.This is how they control          us.Paklas in the brain.They translate for us, they spy on us.As we already discussed, very small paklas in our blood stream          rejuvenate us, by manipulating our hormones to regenerate dead cells that wouldnt usually regenerate.The water of the well          of life is rich in these miniscule paklas, thats how it is able to heal us.Despair is, I suspect, a chemical reaction          in the tissues of the body induced by an imbalance in the hormones in the brain, synthesising minerals dissolved in our blood          from these lurking paklas.Flesh becomes stone; though its not really stone, its a crystalline form of carbon.Despair in short is a way of keeping us docile; if we arent happy, our bodies are turned to stone.Enjoy your lotor die!Evil, but effective; and the technology is not so very hard.The Kaun have powers beyond our imagining, Sai ias informed me, anxiously.Thats only because youre so fucking dumb, Sai ias!My civilisations science is considerably more advanced than yours,          I said, scornfully.Give me a lab and equipment, I could replicate all these effects.You can control minds?said Sai ias.We have done so.Not any more, we fought a war over it with the Southern Tribes.Not all our wars are futile, I added, tauntingly.After the encounter with Djamrocks brain, and my final explanations of how the Kaun control us, we returned to the grasslands.The planning stage was over.The war was about to begin.And each of the creatures on our world had a part to play in my complex and audacious battleplan.The aerials patrolled the sky; they could warn us at once if the Kaun made any attempt to open the firmament and attack us          from above.Sai ias had spent three days motionless in the waters near the Tower, studying the movements of the Metal Giant.And, as I          predicted, she saw it vanishproving that it was a projection turned off by a simple switch.And she also saw a two legged          creature emerge from the earth, and wander around for a while.This was a Kaun, I was sure of it.The Tower wasnt their          home, but it was their way in and out of the interior world.And so it was the Tower we would attack.Sai ias and the sea creatures would carry land warriors under the gap in the force          protector shield.And when an army was gathered inside, we would break open the entrance way to the Kauns section of the          ship and flood into the exterior world, where dwelled the Kaun.At the same time, using the Temple building as our scaffold, we would attempt to breach the very sky, using the strength of          the giant sentients like Fray and Ioday and Miaris to rip apart the metal hull.Serpentines would be hauled up and would squeeze          through the gap created; and they would advance mercilessly upon our enemies who resided, so I believed, on the other side          of the sky.There were however several terrible obstacles in our way; I carefully marked them off in my mind.Firstly, the Kaun could shut off our air.If we suffocated, how could we fight?The answer was simple; for I knew that Sai ias could survive for very long periods without air.So, once we broke through into the outer hull, via the Tower gateway, we would all charge inside and fight desperately and          savagely; while Sai ias would take the rear.Then, once the air was cut off, we would all diethe giant sentients, the aerials, the arboreals, the serpentines, all of          us; but before we died, we would wreak as much damage as we could.And then Sai ias would follow behind; and she and she alone would finish the war, clambering over our corpses to do so.We          all knew her phenomenal fighting power; she was the only weapon we truly needed.And our own deaths were, we all felt, a small price to pay for victory.A second problem remained however; for we knew that the Kaun could control us through the paklas in our brain.They could          turn a switch and send us into dreamless sleep; and then all of us, including Sai ias, would be wretchedly and easily defeated.I wrestled hard with this problem; and in the days after showing Djamrocks brain to the others, I consulted with Quipu ceaselessly          in the hope he might find a subtle scientific solution.Yet he had none; so I chose to embark upon my wildest gamble yet.And now my course was clear.First I had to free my people from the mind control of the Kaun, by the most brutal means possible.And then I had to lead them to victory; and their inevitable doom.I kneeled in the clearing with Fray and Quipu and Sai ias, while our whole army encircled us.Quipu held the knife in his          delicate hands.And he pressed it to my forehead.And he dug the knife in, until it penetrated the bone.Then he carved a circle of blood around my skull.And pressed harder, until knife dug into bone, all the way around my forehead.Quipu then carefully lifted the skull cap away from my head, until the brain beneath was bared.What can you see?I asked.Brain, said Quipu One snappily.Precious little of it, its a miracle you can Look for the crystal!I said angrily.I felt naked and vulnerable with my brain bare to the world; and only the paklas in          my bloodstream were saving me from shock, trauma, and sudden death.I see it, said Quipu Two.Then take it out, I said.Quipus sharp blade gouged deep into the tissues of my brain and I recoiled in horror; surely this was the worst thing that          had ever happened to me!But I endured it; and a few moments later I was looking at the bloody crystal in Quipus hand.Water, I said.Sai ias sprinkled the healing water from the well of life over my exposed brain.Quipu spoke; but I could not understand his words.The others joined in; it was a babble of discordant sounds.My pakla could no longer translate!And the theory was proved.Then Quipu slipped the skull back into place.Sai ias splashed more water on the join, and wrapped a bandage around my head.I felt somewhat dizzy; but I was confident none of them knew my species well enough to read the panic in my eyes.I spoke: Can you understand me?Another babble of sound.They could understand me, but I could not understand them.And so it began; the cutting of brains.Within hours the clearing was a pool of blood.The brain tainted crystals were piled high.And as each of my fellow slaves          lost their crystal, they lost the ability to understand each other.The clearing became a babble of competing noises, with          no meanings.Then Sai ias extruded her brain out of her skull carapace for the operation to be performed.I held the knife.Hell Ship           Sai ias I was among the last to have my brain cut open; I was dreading it terribly.But before the blade touched my extruded brain, Sharrock paused and dropped the knife to his side.For the sky had darkened;          and we turned and looked, and saw two huge creatures came beating a path out of the blue sky.Cuzco.And Djamrock.Both back from the dead.I howled, in horror and dismay, and my brain shrank back into my skull, still uncut.Sharrock backed away, still holding the knife.And Cuzco swooped down towards us low and fast, and his neck and skull orifices          blazed fire; and Sharrocks body was engulfed in flames.I tried to spit web on my burning friend, to put out the fire; but          my mouth was dry.I could not spit.But Sharrock rolled wildly on the grass; and Fray pissed upon him; and his charred body stood and he was ready for combat          once again.And all around me, the fighting commenced.Imagine a battle like nothing you can imagine.Thousands of us fought against two; but Cuzco and Djamrock were the mightiest of giants, and could fly.The aerials were helpless against them; the grazers were burned casually as they          fled; the giant sentients like Fray were powerless to fight, for Djamrock and Cuzco could plunge down and rip pieces out of          their hide before they could bite or butt.The larger aerials fared better; but they were puny by comparison to these, the          greatest of the giant sentients possessed of the power of flight.Quipus body was ripped from top to toe within the first few minutes of this ghastly massacre, though his wounds were not          fatal.Lirilla loyally attacked and died an early death.Sharrock fought bravely with sword and fists though his skin was          burned and charred; but his power was nothing against these two brutes.Miaris, a giant sentient almost as large as Djamrock, stood on his hind legs, and hurled powerful blows at the two flying          monsters.His fists were like cliffs; his skin was as tough as granite; his jaws could chew through metal.But Djamrock dropped          upon him from above, and gouged open his skull, and ripped apart his body; and spat acid upon him.And Miaris roared, and          fell.The battle raged; the arboreals fought and died, as did the aerials, as did the giant sentients.No one could withstand this          double assault by the flying giants of our world; and the grass was red with blood and gore now, and screams became a wearily          familiar background noise.So the battle fell to me; I alone could fight against such huge flying beasts; and I had, after all, bested Cuzco once before.And ever since I have wondered: could I have defeated them?Was it in my power to best two of the greatest monsters on board          the ship?I will never know; for throughout the whole conflict, I could not move.I stood, betrayingly, like a statue, observing helplessly          as the battle played out.Sharrock screamed at me to help; but I could not.I was, I realised, under the control of the Kaun; there was a pakla still inside me.I fought its power; I wrestled for freedom.I poured every particle of my soul into this one desperate goal: to move, and fight, and kill.And eventually I succeeded!I was able to stir my paralysed limbs; and I moved; and I seized Sharrock in my long tentacle;          and I squeezed him to death.And then I fell asleep; a deep dreamless sleep.And when I woke, the corpses were all gone.The grasses grew high, with no trace of the blood that had stained them, or the          body parts that had been so carelessly strewn.The piles of paklas had vanished; there was nothing at all to indicate a terrible          battle had taken place at this spot.Some months had passed, I deduced; and the world had returned to normal; and was populated once more by my comrades.Fray,          Lirilla, Miaris, I saw them all, going about their business, and they saw me.They were all magically restored to life, with          no trace of their appalling and fatal injuries.Whilst Cuzco and Djamrock patrolled the skies above, proud and arrogant and unassailable.I realised then which was the most appalling of the powers of the Kaun; it was their gift of resurrection.They had brought          Cuzco and Djamrock back to life; and they had done the same for the rest of those slain in that brave, yet futile battle.And so we would never again dare defy them.For they weresurely they were?gods.We cannot speak of it, said Quipu.Quipu like me was one of the few actual survivors of that day; he had been badly hurt, and still required the healing powers          of the water of the well of life to mend his scarred body and the partially damaged brain of Quipu Five; but the Quipus had not been resurrected.It was a horror beyondwell, it was the worst of all horrors, said Quipu Two.I fell asleep, said Quipu Three, and then Cuzco lives!said Quipu Four.Quipu Five grunted; incoherent yet still following the discussion.Not Cuzco, I said.Not the Cuzco I knew.For a few days ago I had touched Cuzco with my tentacle tip and begged for his pity.And he had looked at me with total scorn.And at that moment, I realised he had no recollection of our intimate experience on the mountain top.We had loved each other          then; but this Cuzco had never loved me.He was a replica from a previous time; a past Cuzco, reincarnate.Fray too had no recollection of the attack upon the Kaun, or of our previous lives together; and nor did Lirilla.Fray was          a stranger to me now; Lirilla knew me not.I found that, strangely, hardest of all to bear.So the handful of us who had survived the war with the Kaun were forced to nurse our secret to ourselves.The story of a          mutiny that had failed; a rebellion that had been thwarted before it had even begun.Sharrock groaned.They had pinned him to a metal spike with cross bars, his arms outstretched; a form of torture I had never encountered before.And they had flogged him, mercilessly.The rain drizzled upon the raw flesh of his wounds, which scarred him from face to          thighs.I sprayed healing moisture on him with my tentacle tips, but it did not help.I spoke to him but he did not respond.His eyes stared into the distance, never blinking.He was, I suspected, quite mad.I stayed with him for four days and nights, talking constantly, explaining to him my new view of things: They are gods, Sharrock,          we cannot defeat them.And then I realised he was awake and he was staring right at me with blank blue eyes and for a brief moment, his sanity returned:          Never give up, he whispered.We are defeated!I protested.But he could not comprehend my words.Then he began to choke.I yearned to help him, but did not know how to.Finally however the choking stopped; and he opened          his mouth.And balanced on his tongue was a red jewel.I reached in with my tentacle and took it out.It was the jewel he had stolen for Malisha.For me?I asked.He grunted, and tried to smile.A gift.Of love.From me to you, he eventually rasped.And then he fainted once more.And blood trickled down his body and further soaked the blood drenched grass; but he did not          die.Two days later Sharrocks body was gone.Sharrock died a heros death; that I will avow.Jak/Explorer This place terrifies me.You made that comment sixty years ago.Its been a long wait.Our patience will be rewarded.When?Soon.I hope it will be soon.Hell Ship           Sharrock They came to mock me.A female and a male; bipeds both, of my approximate height.The male, I guessed, was the leader.For he stood with arrogant          confidence and stared at me with cruelty; and fire spat from his fingertips.Whereas shewell.An evil bitch without a doubt,          for she took the deepest joy in witnessing my downfall, and stared at me with old eyes that were full of lust; a lust for          pain.I am in a room somewhere on the ship, I know not where.For I fell into a dreamless sleep and when I awoke I was no longer          tied to a stake near the lake, I was terrifyingly elsewhere.Grey walls surrounded me.I could hear nothing of the rest of          the ship; my room was bare apart from the magnetic plate on the ceiling, from which they had dangled me by the metal shackles          on my wrists.After I had been left hanging like this for several days, some Kindred arrived with knives.They taunted me, though I could          not understand their words, then they flayed my skin off me a piece at a time.They left me raw and bleeding, a glistening          body of bare muscle and exposed ligaments and bulging eyes.The pain was intense, worse than anything I had ever known before; and I assumed I was going to die.But I am not dead.And my skin is already starting to grow back.My guess is that once I am restored and whole, they will          flay me, one piece at a time, all over again.Water from the ceiling bathes me constantly; I assume this is water from the well of life and it is helping to keep me alive          despite my appalling injuries and my lack of covering skin.The aim I suppose is to torture me for all eternity.Let them.For the painAh!The pain!Cling to that Sharrock.Cling to the pain!You are not defeated.Not yet.Not defeated.Never defeated!The pain is my ally, not my enemy.Embrace the pain, Sharrock!For while I feel pain that rends the soul and rips every nerve ending and fills my head with an          agonising howl I know I am        Still alive.I wondered a great deal about those two who came to mock me, just a few days after the Kindred had done their vile work.For          I knew them to be Kaun.They were dressed in rich robes in a style I did not recognise.Their faces were black and withered.Their eyes stared as if they were looking across to the other end of the universe.Their features were entirely expressionless.Was that a consequence of great age?How old are these godsforsaken monsters anyway?And why do they do what they do.Boredom?Perhaps, I speculate, age corrodes the emotions.Perhaps the smaller emotions like irritation and amusement and delight rot          away, and all that are left are the huge and richly coloured emotions: like hate, and rage.That might explain why these creatures          do what they do.The male had stared at me for a long time before departing, as if studying me.Why?Had he never seen a flayed warrior before?I lose consciousness from time to time and I know that this is the prelude to death; but each time the healing sprays revive          me.It is Day the First on the interior world; I know that for certain, for I keep a mental tally.Today Sai ias will be exploring          her world.I try toAh!Agonising blinding pain!Embrace it, Sharrock!Embrace it!I wonder about what Sai ias is feeling and doing.Right now.Perhaps she is swimming in the lake?And perhaps Lirilla is singing as she hovers in the air, her tiny wings beating?And perhaps Fray is galloping on the savannah; while Quipu bickers with himselves?And perhaps Sai ias can feel the sunshine on her moist black hide?Perhaps.Hell Ship           Explorer/Jak So many lost civilisations; too many.This has become my duty, and my obsession; as we travel, I fish for scraps of information about lost worlds and collate it          and archive it all.I am a machine and hence I take great relish in the meticulous storing and cataloguing and cross referencing of this data;          for as far as the computing part of me is concerned, it is merely data.My machine mind is however merged with the mind of an Olaran who is clearly filled with horror at the scale of these tragic          losses; and his anguish perturbs me.Sometimes the information I garner is random, the noises and imprints left by any technological culture, though such echoes          in spacebroadcast dramas and poems and factual films and radio messages between spaceships or planetscan be highly illuminating.Other times, however, the information is found in the form of compressed datacaches intended to be last messages from dying          civilisations desperate to be remembered somehow.Such data may be technical or astronomical or military or historical or          all of these; but sometimes more personal messages are also inscribed in this way.The collation of these archives keeps my mind active.I am lonely much of the time.Jak is not such very good company.Not          compared to Albinia.He is better than he was.For after our departure from that second universe, Jak fell into despair.And then came the madness.And after the madness, came despair again.Now he is merely sad; and occasionally he even talks to me.I have made a list of the universes which we have travelled through, both the live ones and the dead ones.Jak refuses to          let me tell him how many there are.But he does, obsessively, read through my archives of lost civilisations.Occasionally          we discuss what he finds there; not often though.Not often enough.There is now, in my opinion, no doubt about the validity of my theory that the dead universes we encounter are the trail left          by the Death Ship; corpses scattered in its bloody wake.No other explanation will suffice; and datacaches have been found          in all but a very few of these wasted universes.There are very many of them; I have had to rebuild my archive in order to accommodate all the data.How long has the Death Ship been destroying realities in this way?I can make no estimate.What weapon is it using?I do not know.Will we ever find the Death Ship, and defeat it?I can make no prediction.But for a period of time that is larger than the lifespan of any Olaran, we have hunted this rogue vessel.We have journeyed          onwards through the many living universes, searching each, one by one, with painstaking care, in the vain hope of stumbling          upon our prey.After one thousand years had elapsed, I explained to Jak that we were wasting our time; there were far too many universes.He agreed.And yet still we continued.But finally I spotted a pattern; and it dawned on me that the Dreaded were observing a loose chronological cycle.Every ninety three          years by our calendarthough occasionally a hundred and ten and sometimes a hundred and fifty yearsthe Death Ship would return          to the sector in space where we first encountered them.And then it would use the weapon that enables the Dreaded to destroy          a universe as easily as an Olaran kills a dangerous and reluctant to trade alien.And then they would pass into the next universe.Their pattern betrayed them.And it encouraged me to formulate a cosmological hypothesis.For it is clear there is only one          place connecting the many universes; and my belief is that this was the point of origin of all the universes.And so I call it the Source.Yet knowing this was no help, not at first anyway.For when we rift, we have no means of ascertaining how far we have travelled,          or in which direction.So finding the Source again in a new and strange universe is no easy task; it can take two hundred          years or more of mapping stars, until our point of origin is reached once more.The only certain test is that when the rest of the universe has evaporatedwell, then the Source is all that is left.We find          it by fleeing the onset of nothingness.But by then, of course, it is too late.And even when we have located it, the Source can move; that was a shock also.Or perhaps its the universe that moves, and the Source that remains; no matter.The point is we have wasted many years seeking          and pursuing the Death Ship through the multiverses.And we have wasted just as many years staying put and waiting at the          Source for its return.Neither strategy has worked for us.But I think I have now devised a star mapping methodology that allows us to find the Source in good time, and remain there.And I am sure that I can detect it if the Source moves; and then we will move with it.It took me approximately ninety thousand years to devise and perfect this approach.And we are now concealed behind a gas          giant close to the Source in a universe with many recent traces of the Dreaded.Each fresh datacache I intercept confirms          me in the belief that they are here.And, sooner of later, they will want to make their escape from this universe.And instead, they will encounter our wrath.We have waited almost sixty years in this place for the ship to appear.On four separate occasions, the Source has moved,          and we have moved with it.And each time it moves, the gas giant and its star also move with it.They are wrapped up, somehow,          in the coils of this gateway to the universes.There is life on the gas giant; not sentient, but life nonetheless.How strange it is for life to be evolving in such a place;          rifting through space at the whim of the cosmological origin.This region of space is a speck of dust in the storm of all          realities; and yet life still births here!I cannot help but think: How stubborn is life!And how mysterious.For as a creature who knows its own artificer, I always          marvel at the existence of organic life.From a purely technical point of view, it is incompetently engineered and badly designed          and, in its sentient forms, all too often annoying.And yetit awes me.I have sent robots to explore the gas giant.I have mapped the geography of its roving clouds, and analysed the chemistry          of its atmosphere, which merges at its lower levels with the fluid interior of the planet.I have studied the biology of its          many microscopic life forms.And I have even named the planetI call it Kraxos.I have named the sun tooI call it Albinia.Yes, a sentimental touch, but I allow myself a few.I have counted all the atoms in the sun.I have named all the microbes          who are the dominant life form on Kraxos; and continue to do so, even though they have a two month life span and new microbes          are constantly being formed from a process of cell fission.It has indeed been a long and tedious wait; and Jak has, without question, been a poor companion, devoid of conversational          artistry and even basic courtesy.Hence my obsessive data analysing.But we are, thanks to my careful preparations, ready in every way for the battle to come.Jak, however, cannot endure very much longer.He is not cut out to be the human half of a machine/mind symbiosis.My thoughts          overwhelm him; he drowns daily on data.I hope his wait will soon be over.Furthermore  Jak!What is it?Are you sane and functional?Just about.We have work to do.A ship approaches.Is it the one?It is an interstellar ship that flies with black sails powered by the invisible matter between the stars, and a helicoid marking          on its hull.So its the one.We may not survive this encounter.I truly hope we do not.One hundred thousand years it has been, since Albinia possessed me.We have lived together in one body all this time and Is this a soliloquy?Get ready for battle, spaceship!Prime the missiles.Prepare the un matter bombs.Check all the I have done all that.We have been here for approximately sixty years; what do you think I have been doing with my time?Were ready?Were ready.The ship approaches.We will destroy it this time.Our lives will end.I just have this one thing I wanted to          say.What?That despite your long brooding silences and ceaseless melancholy, your company has not been entirely unendurable.I love you too metal brain.I didnt saywait!Its closing in.No more talking!The battle will soon commence.Hell Ship           Sai ias The new one was angry and resentful.You must accept, I told her, the way things are.I accept nothing!she screamed.She was a four legged predator of the plain, with sharp teeth and a tail like a whisk that          was larger than her body.She had ugly, barnacled skin, and her voice was a rasping obscenity.She was, I could easily guess,          accustomed to being the dominant species, and she treated me as if I were one of her anal parasites.Fight!Fight those grass eating scum!Rip our enemies to pieces!Eat their poisoned flesh!Thats what I shall do, when I          have the chance!she ranted.You will never have the chance, I told her.Dont be so sure.Im not like the rest of you shameful cowards!I will fight, and I will win!she raged.No, I said.Acceptance is all.The Kaun cannot be defeated.Believe me, I added, bitterly, we have tried.Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer I am ready.My mind is now fully merged once more with the mind of Explorer.I exist in many places; in the missiles we carry,             in the concealed flying bombs that orbit these planets, in our drone craft, in the matter traps that cordon off the entire             stellar system.I am no longer Olaran; I am a killing machine.Less talk, please Jak.Lets commence to kill this parent fucker.First missiles have been fired.Feel them fly.Ah!Feel them fly!Hell Ship           Sai ias I could bathe you, I said to Fray, as she paced by the borders of the yellow savannah.You might enjoy that.Fray glared at me.Why in all fuckery, she said angrily, would I allow you to do such a thing?In the past you There is no past!Stop your fantasies, you vile creature!I have only just been captured, my world has been destroyed.And          it happened just a few months ago.You talk as ifno, we do not know each other!You are simply some strange alien monster with whom I am trapped!
