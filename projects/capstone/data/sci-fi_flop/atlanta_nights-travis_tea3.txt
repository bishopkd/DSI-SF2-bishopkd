I like the way you think, Bruce Lucent.Bruce took a remote control from his pocke t, pointed it at the garage.An engine  roared to life as the door began to shudder   open; in a moment a car emerged, its doors  opening gently as a suggestion.Its ready when we are, said Bruce.He smiled.Im always ready.If you  are ...He was already in, on the drivers side; no one had to ask Penelope twice.# # #         There are moments when life, like a bad movie, gives us theme music.The good  stuff is quiet  maybe Rachmaninoff, played softly in the background; Bach or  Beethoven  in the classy films, its one of those, or maybe Mozart.Bruce Lucents life  wasnt like that.More like, oh, more like Popcorn  the electronic pop version, quick, zippy, headed straight toward a climax.In the end, well, its a little flat  too much air,  too little substance; it just aint Beethove n, you know what I mean?But its something,  and we cant all be Beethoven, there isnt talent enough in all the world for that.Penelope nestled into the crook of Bruces arm.It didnt matter to her that the  music was Popcorn; for her it was Wagner and Valkyries, all the way.I love your lustrous hair, he whispe   red.I love red hair, real red, its so  beautiful.Only her hairdresser knew for sure, and   itd been years since hed confided in  Penelope.She didnt know what color shed     have without him, and shuddered at the  thought.Youre a sweet man, she said.I love your passion.Bruce grinned.You make me rapturously happy, he said.Penelope Urbain felt a chill that thrilled her.Me too, she said.He raised an  eyebrow.I mean, you make me feel  so happy, too.Rapturously happy.Yeah, thats  the word for it  rapturous.She could feel his firm studly body under her left hand.He was smiling at her.He looked hungry.I was in an auto accident, once, he said.The doctors told me Id never walk  again.But they were wrong.She smiled, nestling into the crook of his ar m.  Of course they were, she said.How did you recover?I lived my dream, he said.And didnt let their nay saying dissuade me.She pressed her voluptuous body against him.He was pulling into the restaurant's  garage, turning, downshifting, jamming the brak e  they were there, parked.The valet  came to her door, helped her from her seat.Bruce gave the man his keys and a twenty;  the man smiled knowingly.Bruce took her arm and led her to the door , where they waited a long moment for  the maitre d'."You're in software?"she said.Bruce smiled."I'm a software develope  r," he said."Well to do  about 20.I  have a studly body, don't you think?"She looked him up and down.It was indeed the finest body that money could buy.She smiled."If I tell you you have a   sexy body," she said, "would you hold it  against me?"He put an arm around her, pulled her close."You know I would," he said.She purred."I like that," she said."I like Atlanta.It's such a cosmopolitan city. "Bruce whispered in her ear."It is. ""Atlanta is a great place for an enthusias tic would be novelist to write about.The  Atlanta Journal Constitution is a first rate paper,  and CNN is headquartered right here in  Atlanta!""Oh, Penelope!""Oh Brad!""I'm Bruce.My name is Bruce, beautiful. ""O Bruce!"Dinner was amazing  Brad or Bruce or   whatever the studmuffin's name was  ordered the eponymous specialty of the house, les moulins de las gallettes, they call it the  food that sings, and it sang for them before it was prepared.They drank before dinner   Bruce ordered, quietly speaking to the waite  r."Deux ouragans, si vous plait.Double  fort. "With dinner there was a magnum of champagne, and after dinner there was coffee  and brandy.Penelope felt her head swim as sh e rested it into the crook of Bruce's arm   it was an amazing meal, an experience she w  ould always treasure.She wanted him so  bad, and there, in the quiet that was the ca ndle lit restaurant, he touched her.She didn't  resist.He wanted her, and she wanted him, too.The elegant Polo Club walls were adorned with a great plentitude of exquisite  paintings, depicting a tremendous multitude     of beautiful scenes, with still lives of  flowers, horses, sailing boats, and landscapes.They are from all sorts of great painters  and they had one every few feet.Their frames are gold gilt and filled with curlicues and  fancy carving.The floors were polished white    marble, with veins of luminous color  running through them, and you can see your count enance in them because they polished  every morning.A commodious, confident cloak room was standing discretely behind the  double door, for coats, but was empty on this lovely, gorgeous, beautiful morning.There  was an elegant, gracious, wide stairway to the second floor that had gilt on the black iron  railing.It was orthogonal and it curved around  it.The carpet was bright, vivid, glorious  red.The French windows in the vestibule were open to the patio, and the sound of tennis games came in, and the scintillating, witty, spar kling chatter from the black wrought iron  tables and chairs with all their twisting tw ining cingulated vines in their arms and legs  there, where lunch was being served and the  smell of the food came in, too.There was a  guest book on a table in the center of the ve  stibule, open to hold the disguised names.There was a flower pot of Wedgewood china,  blue and white, sat behind it, filled with a  colorful, fragment, teeming profusion a nd arrangement of sweet scented, multicolored  flowers.Their vivid color contrasted w  ith the stark, plain, severe starkness of the  unadorned walls.The Atlanta Polo Club was an old and resp ected and very venereal institution.It  had been founded more than two centuries ago and was members from all the most  respectable, notable and antique families in   the area.When Sherman came marching  through Georgia they had saved a few things  from the old Polo Club, and the noble and  distinguishable members were very proud of  their traction.They gads been very poor  after the war, but no presumptuous, odious, vi  al carpetbagger or scallywags had been  permitted too scornfully, contemptuously darken the doors of the Polo Club.They had  carefully rebuilt it of dark oak paneling a  nd the lead framed windows that were there  now.They had spared no expense.They had played polo whit cavalry horse brought  carefully back from the war, by young, ha      ndsome, honorable Calvary officers of  immemorial memory from the war.They        were very very proud of their disgusted  memory and extended ancestry.They had an  tique cavalry swords crossed over every  marble fireplace.Many people tried to join it and couldn't.It was very exclusive.Some  of the aged members don't want anyone at all fr om the north to join, but there were other  members who were retrogressive and onward  thinking and they managed to ease folks about those members, as long they stood       docility and listed resentfully when the  members talked prolixly about the novel war.Some of their new members were very  good polo players and they had industriously managed too won many difficult games.Irene Stevens starts to pertly walk in to the Polo Club.She had long blonde hair  and a voluptuous body.She was about 20.She was dressing in an expensive designer  cerulean gown and not a bit of jewelry; her   beauty needed no jewelry.She tried and  signed the guest book.She had come there from her hotel, where she had checked out that morning.She  had driven here down the tortuous roads by all the Civil War monuments and past the  pastures where they get the polo horses.They were all thoroughbreds and very beautiful.There had been flowers all along the way:  roses and tulips and asters and crocuses and  lilies and magnolias.She had managed to park  her vehicle in the newest parking lot but  she had been compiled to park it where the fe rocious sunlight would infernally heat it up  while she was leisurely enjoining the Polo  Club.The soaring oak trees and maple trees  had gloomily, dismally shaded the parking lot.Elegantly, She walked up the stairs.the gown swished mysteriously about her  legs.The sparkling mirror in the stairway considerately let her prudentially endeavor to  carefully check her hair and jewelry.The artificial, incandescent light did not become  her.It unflatteringly made her verdant dress and gold necklace look ghastly unbecoming.But nothing could, in its worst efforts, ma  de her look less than marvelously stunning,  could really detract from her gorgeous beauty and loveliness and she hurriedly took arctic  comfort and consolation in that.She urgently meandered down the marmor  eal hallway to the opulent, exotic,  expansive bar.It was very, very crowde  d and odorously noisy.All the men instantly  stopped and ardently looked at her.She w earisomely sighs.She was getting very tired  of the way all the men instantly stopped a nd ardently looked at her voluptuous body and  long blonde hair and her vermilion dress      and her gold watch with the diamonds.Especially when they were such tiresome stuffy old business men and none of them could  adequately, competently, sufficiently play tennis let alone anything more private.And all  the women cattily looked at her with sniffy e xpressions, when they were foolish wearing  too much makeup and revolting, unsightly jewelry.She can be already heard the snide  gossip began too perambulated its gossipy       peregrinations about the ostentatiously  crowded bar.Swiftly, she sveltely walks up to the   bar and smoothly orders a Bloody Mary.The bartender sagaciously nods.He competently  takes a crystal glass.He swiftly gets  the  cold ice and put it in the empty glass.Consequently, he gets the imported, foreign  vodka and put it in the glass with the red, opaque tomato juice.He sticks a fair wedge of  easy lemon on the edge of it and promptly gives her it.She comfortably sat back in her opulent, luxurious chair and leisurely sighed.This was the right thing, after a long, w earisome, odious burdens and troubles of  an appalling day like that.She toyed with her pearls.The comfortable chair was brown leather and very nice.She liked it.And she was here in the bar.Alone.It was nice.No one would talk here.She carefully    tried and soothed out the skirt of her  sallow dress.She fortuitously remembered Henry Archer.She managed too shivered in memory.No wonder no one was looking attentive  anymore, next to him.She  sips her martini.That was when Steven Suffern saw her.Steven was a well built and well hung young ma sseuse at the Polo Club.He has  an eye for the ladies, but bats for both teams.His eyes narrowed when he saw her.Irene Stevens.Hear.Alone.There was no one around.No one would come to the Polo Club   on such a dreary, wet day, especially so  entirely early in the morning.Thunder cracked thunderously overhead.There was a loud, voluminous  drumming and thumping of precipitous and abundant rain.He walked toward her.Slowly.Took each  step in leisure.Contemplating Irena  with gimlet eyes.Taking in that voraci  ous figure and the elonga ted blond hair.The  carroty dress.The ruby band.He wanted  to linger, to savor the moment, to pounce at  once.She leisurely drank from her gin and tonic again."Irena," he pontificates."You are the   daughter of Isaac Stevens.I will reveal  your dark secret to your father unless you allow me to have my way with you. ""No," exclaimed she, horror stuck."Yes," grated he, harshly."You will not!"expostulated she."I will reveal your dark secret!"exclaimed he."I will not allow you to have you way with me!"she avowed."You will!"he averted."No, you won't reveal my dark secret," th reatened she, numbly."My father will  never believe you. ""I will, and he will," exerted her."You won't and he won't," claimed he."I will, and he will," remonstrated he."You won't," explained she, in an explanatory tone of voice."My father will be  very, very, very furious with you.He will certainly blame you. ""I will and he won't," demonstrated he, contemptuously."You won't and he will," proclaimed her, definitely."I will and he won't," declared he, defiantly."You won't," denounced her, angrily."I already told him last Tuesday. "It was as if a copious galleon of wintry water had been surreptitiously poured over  his hansom head.He sat stonily and goggled  explicitly and gaped impassively as if he  were a fish precipitously extracted from   its appropriately aqueous environment.He boisterously, wordlessly, softly sputtered like a boiling tea kettle.He stolidly sat like an  ancient, moss overgrown statue from the ra diantly fragrant gardens that the noble city  was plenteously, bountifully endowed with.She contentiously got up and stylishly walked away, her amethystine dress  swirling about her ankles, fondly rememberi ng his exquisite, superb physique and form  of his well proportionate, muscled body.She dazedly walked down the polished wood of  the stairway and out of the Polo Club and  up the hill and under the oaks and over to her  vehicle.The nightclub was the Blue Velvet.It was noisy and hot and Callie was thinking  how the sweat made her look hot.The heat of  the Atlanta last night made it even hotter  inside.Bruce didn't like the Blue Velvet because it was full of old people who thought it  was still a cool place only it wasn't any more.He did think Callie looked hot."Hey, do you want to dance?"he said."Sure. "Bruce wasn't hot and thought if he tired  Callie out he might get a better deal on  the merging companies.Callie thinks Bru  ce is studly looking, and she liked to dance  anyway, so she said yes.They danced for a long time.Until she says she was tired and could they sit down  at a table.Now she felt really tired but was sure the sweat made her look really hot to Bruce.She smoothed her glossy black tresses."You didn't put any drugs in this dri  nk, did you?"she said.She thought Bruce  might try to take advantage of her to get a better deal on the merger."Speaking of the merger," Bruce asked, "what did you want to do about that?"He  has to shout over the noise of the band.The band was a retro 80's punk rock band.They  were a local group and looked like high school  boys.Callie thought one of them looked  pretty hunky, but not as hunky as Bruce."I think it's a good idea. "She whispered, "what couples a million?"Bruce decided he should think about it and said, "I'm going to have to think about  it. ""Did you want more?""Well, sure, of course I want more.Why would I want less?"He really thought he  could get a lot more.He wasn't thinking just about that one kind of merger, either."It's pretty warm in here, maybe late r we could go somewhere quieter and talk  about the details. ""Like what kind of details?""Like who will run the merged company for one thing. ""I sort of thought I would and you'd be my second in command. ""I think we'll have to talk about that.But I think we should dance some more right  now. "They danced for a long time.While they were dancing Bruce asked Callie about her husband."Did you wear him out dancing like this?""You mean like dance so much until he had a heart attack or something?""Yeah. ""No. "Bruce laughed."I almost died once. ""I heard about that.I did a lot of res earch on you before I agreed our companies  should merge. ""It was a car crash. ""You seem pretty well recovered. ""I have some pretty nasty scars though.I was 16 and I run the car into a pole. ""I'll have to see them sometime. ""Maybe later, if we go somewhere quieter to talk about the merger. "She spills her drink all over him."Oh, I'm so sorry!I guess we'll have to go now. ""No, it's ok.I can dry it off  with these napkins. "He wiped at his shirt.He was  starting to get hot and it kind of made he feels cooler in a way.Besides he wasn't ready to  talk about details of the merger yet.He wanted to make sure Callie was more tireder first."See that all dry?"he said."By the way, I th ink it's pretty cool what your company does.Transatlantic shipping is pretty interesting. ""Yes it will be good to be merged with  your software company.I know you make  a lot of money with your Internet multi le vel marketing software.With the money you  make from all those people sending you money  and from my shipping, we'll be able to  take trips all over the world all the time. "Besides, she thought he was pretty studly and if  it didn't work out after a while they could un merge their companies too."You're older than a lot of the women I talk to," he said, and he meant it."My husband said the opposite thing when he was alive.He said I was younger  than the people his age.But I learned a   lot from him about running business.Nobody  thought I could run it after he died, but I s  howed them. "Bruce thinks she has a pretty  good body for someone her age.She was probabl y the same age as his mother only his  mother wasn't very good looking like Callie  .She had a voluptuous body even if she  wasn't twice as old as I."Well it's getting late isn't it?Do you th ink we should stop dancing now and talk  about business?"She really wanted to get the big deal finished t onight and not have to  involve all the lawyers."I don't know. "Bruce wasn't sure if  she was tired enough.Since she was older,  she was probably wiser.Even though he wa       s well to do himself from his software  company, she was twice his age and had proba bly learned a lot more about business than  he did so he has to be careful of any tr icks she might pull."Are you pretty tired?We  could go back to my place. ""It's pretty hot in here. "She said."Then let's have another drink.Since you spilled that one before you didn't get to  finish it. ""Okay but just one more. ""Could we get another drink?"Bruce asked  the bartender.She was pretty hot too  and more Bruce's type since she was younger.Bruce liked her red hair.Callie's hair was  black which was okay with Bruce but he      liked red better.The bartender was maybe  exactly 22.He knew she had to be more than   21 to serve.He thought he should order  more drinks just to have her come over to where they were sitting at the bar."Here you are. ""Thanks. ""You're welcome. ""Thanks," Callie said too."And you're welcome too. "Bruce liked the way the bartender said "you're welcome. "But  he was here with Callie and thought he shoul  d pay attention to her instead.They were  here to talk about the merger was another reason."We could merge our offices together too. ""That might be nice. "Callie didn't like her office all that we   ll.It was on the top floor of the  NationsBank building in downtown.That's being the tallest building in Atlanta.The view  was good but she didn't like how long it took to ge t up in the elevator every time."I don't  really like my office," she said."Well then we can all use my office. "Hi s office was back in California and had a  lot of plants in it.Bruce thought it was cool   that they hired someone to come in with a  tank of water to water the plants since they  were real and not fake.It didn't look out over the city or anything but he didn't know what kind of view Callie's office had anyway so it  didn't matter."When we go to your place to talk about the merger, you can show me your scars.I bet you have impressive scars. ""From the car crash.Yes, they are impre ssive. "He sipped his beer."I could show  you here but I'd have to take off my shirt  and I think they don't allow that here. "He  smiled.Callie smiled too.She wanted to make      sure she didn't get too drunk so she  finished this one which was a scotch and  ordered a beer.You don't get as drunk from a  beer.She held her drinks pretty good anyway  because she learned to drink scotches from  her husband who had been a heavy drinker.It  was too.Bad Bruce was playing hard to  get about the merger.He was wondering if sh e had enough to drink yet so he could get a  good deal.She was thinking they were having   one of those awkward silent times in a  conversation and she should say something."If we did merge what will that do to the depreciation do you think?"Bruce didn't know anything about depreciation and was now getting worried."You're not thinking of backing out being you?""No, I don't think so. ""The depreciation thing is worrying you I think. ""It's always a worry, isn't it?""Well it's different on shipping than on software I'm pretty sure. ""We'll make a lot of money if we merge though.We both know that. "Bruce stretched.She thought she could s ee the outline of his scars under his tight  black shirt that was the same color as her   hair.He was afraid he might be getting tired  and it was probably time to move things al ong.Merging their companies was going to be  a good idea no matter what the objections and he   told her, "I think merging will be a  good idea no matter what, don't you?"He was a  little worried about driving because he'd  had his car crash at night like this and it was when he was maybe a little drunk so he was  hoping he could drive okay.They would really make a lot of money if they merged.He had done a lot of  mergers and this was going good.His accountant would be really happy with this merger."Do you want to have another glass      of wine or do you think we should go  somewhere quieter?I can hardly hear you in here. "She could hardly hear him either.So they went back to his place and hammered out the details of the merger and  signed the papers."Then that's it.We're all merged!"She toasted him with the champagne glasses.That wasn't all that got merged that night.They had wild sex.Bruce Lucent limped out onto the patio in  the hot light of the late afternoon sun,  carrying a tray where a mound of freshly chopped up hamburger gleamed red and wet  like a pile of bloody spaghetti, and put the   tray down on the gleaming glass patio table  with its matching set of six wrought up iron ch airs, where Penelope Urbain sat with her  long legs as graceful as the fronds of a   willow tree crossed in a provocative pose that  made him think about last night and the passion theyd shared hour after hour till the  turgid light of dawn folded down over Atla nta like the petals of a bloody rose and they  were both too exhausted to move another mu scle.Maybe, hed thought as they sank into  sleep like two swimmers whod just won a  race across the English Channel, just maybe  things were going to work out after all.Maybe  they could get it together at last.Seeing her now, as beautiful and fresh as a s unny morning in May, even though it was August,  his heart skipped a bat.Hey, babe, Bruce offered.Wanna grill some  hamburgers?The happy expression fell off of Penelope   Urbains finely featured visage.She  pressed her slender hand to her moist red lip s and shook her lustrous red hair back over  her shoulders, bouncing like the vibrant mane of a thoroughbred horse.Is that ...meat?she gasped, her eyes, the color of a warm blue sky in  springtime, falling onto the tray.Red ...meat?Yeah, babes, Bruce affirmed proudly.Bona fide 100% sirloin.Penelope fluttered, her corn flower blue eyes still stuck to the tray.Its really  grizzly.Honey, dont you like hamburgers?Bruce  wanted to know, crestfallen.That  beef is chalked full of protein!Bruce gr  inned contagiously.And we could both use  some protein, after last night!If you know what I mean!But ...dont you remember, Bruce?Pe  nelope reproached, her sapphire orbs  now grasping his.Im a vegetarian!Bruces lungs ricocheted with shock, cau sing him to let out a gasp, and remorse  swept over him in a stunning tide.Darn, he exclaimed to himself.How could I forget  that?Wow, babe, Bruce stumbled, Im ...Im really sorry.I. ..I guesses should have  picked up a carrot or something while I was at the store.Its ...its OK, honey, Penelope tried to smile forgivingly, but he could see the  betrayal in her limpid azure eyes exactly like shed said it out loud.Im ...Im not really all that hungry.Ill just watch while you and Isadore eat.He ...he is coming, isnt  he?Hes Enright right now.Good.I. ..I was hoping he would, she commented softly.Bruce Lucent put the tray down on the tabl  e.  He began to shape the hamburger  patties, shaping the meat into round, circular shapes with his strong hands.Usually he  caressed the hamburger like a lover, loving the  way the soft red meat squished yieldingly  between his hands and the sensuous sucki ng sounds it made when he pulled his hands  away once he got the round shapes just the way he wanted them, not too thick and not too  thin, not too wide and not too small, but ju  st right, like the Three Bears, except it was  hamburger and not porridge.He was an artist with hamburger, everyone said so.But today it wasnt good like usual.The way Penelopes exquisite features had  fallen when her eyes swooped down onto the meat had taken roots inside his brain like  the tentacles of a poisonous black spider.I let her down again, he berated himself savagely.I betrayed her.Again.Why didnt I remember that shes a vegetarian?he ruminated to himself  worriedly.This must be the fourth time Ive forgotten.Or is it the fifth?But Im  forgetting a lot of things,  his thoughts veered off on a tangent.So many things I cant  remember since my accident.Like ...like making hamburgers with my mother.He remembered a lot about his mother.Too much, in fact.The alcohol binges.The beatings.The way shed sit in front of the TV smoking crack and watching infomercial.The time the cops had to come to the house because shed set the dog on fire.Hed loved that dog  Fluffy, his name had been, and there were times when hed been sure that he was his only friend.The time she went into his closet and cut up all his clothes.The time she stole the money hed saved up from his crappy evening job at the roller rink and spent it all on nail extensions.The way her fat legs bulged inside her spandex stirrup pants, so different from Penelopes slender frond like limbs.The way shed cut him down all the time, laughing at him, telling him hed never amount to anything, never get anywhere in the world.Well, ma, you arent laughing now, he asserted to himself.Im not a pimply wimp anymore.Im a stud, a rich businessman, with a fabulous house and a voluminous redheaded girlfriend and lots of friends.How does ya like them hamburgers?Hed always wanted to shout those words into her fat face, her ugly fat hateful face with its garish caked on makeup and glittery paste on eyelashes.But she died before any of the good stuff happened and hed never gotten to yell it into her fat face like he wanted.Shed choked to death on a cocktail frank while watching infomercial.Hed found her there the next morning, stiff as beef jerky.I remember all that, his thoughts continued, squashing the red meat between his fingers like he was squashing his mothers throat.I remember it like it was yesterday.But not the hamburgers.I. ..dont ...remember ...the hamburgers?Why?Why?Sweetie, are you ..., IS your OK?came Penelope Urbains soft voice, sliding into his tortured thoughts like a cool shaft of evening rain into the fiery heart of hell.You look like youre trying to crush it or something!she exclaimed worriedly.Bruce Lucent gusted a sigh that siphoned up from the bottom of his heart and hoisted his thoughts up out of the black stinking mineshaft of memory.Mom was dead.Shed never laugh at him again.That part of his life was over.He didnt have to think about her now.Who cared if he couldnt remember the hamburgers?Hed learned how to make them himself.Yeah, ma!He affirmed.A contemptuous smile squirming across his well shaped lips.I learned it all myself!Howdy folks!resounded a cheery voice from inside the house.We grilling yet?Isadore Trent came striding out onto the patio, his washboard abs tight as a drum underneath his skintight white tee shirt.His red hair in its ponytail hung down his strong muscular back like the vibrant mane of a thoroughbred hose.Isadore!cried Penelope, her soft tones vibrating joyfully.Is ...,, is it you?One in the same!Isadore cried.Its ...its so good to see you!Great to see you too, Pen!Isadore exclaimed, turning to Bruce.Say, Bruce,  great patties!Bruce Lucents head gave a stiff nod.He didnt like the way Penelope had said  hello to Isadore.Why was she so glad to see  him?She hardly knew hi m.  Or at least ...he thought she hardly knew him.Guess Ill get these on the grill, he info rmed.The two of them didnt seem to  notice.He picked up the tray and walked ove r to the grill.Opening the grill, he put the tray down on the table beside it and put the patties on the grill.They hissed and spattered  from the grill while behind his back Isadore and Penelope were talking about vegetables.Whats your favorite, Pen?Isadore wanted to know.Oh, I ...I dont know, Penelope responded breathily.I. ..I think maybe lettuce.Or a broccoli.I. ..I like them to be green.Bruce flipped the spluttering patties on the gr ill with an expert flick of his strong  wrist.Inside his chest, his hart seemed to splutter too.Why were they talking about  vegetables?he wondered darkly.Well, Penelope was a vegetarian ...but he'd never  known that Isadore cared about things like that.Im an artichoke man myself, Isadore declared.Give me a good artichoke  anytime.You know ...his confident voice kicked down a notch.It's the way you have  to peel them.One leaf ...after another ...and by the time you get down to the heart, the  soft warm luscious gleaming heart, youre ...ready.Really ...ready.Isadore!Penelope fluttered with her  soft voice.I. ..I didnt know you were so  poetic.Theres lots of things you dont know        about me, Pen, Isadore asserted  confidently.Lots of things.This is  wrong, but Bruce's thoughts told hi  m.  It was all going wrong.And he  didnt know why.Bruce Lucent piled the now over cooked patties back onto the tray and carried  them over to the patio table where Isador e and Penelope were now laughing hardily at  something Isadore had said.He banged the  tray down on the table, the glass making a  ringing sound that echoed the ringing that was  sounding in his ears.A ringing of fury.A ringing of despair.He was losing her, but   he knew it.Last night had been an illusion.
