None of us can hit that mark, and we can only ask forgiveness from he who managed it.My heart tells me Im doing the right thing, however imperfect it may be.They all have the clockwork plague?Gavin asked quietly.Adames nodded.Most of them die, but we save a few.And the ones who become zombies?Alice asked.Its hard.Adames looked away.I have Berta put them in the catacombs, and she leaves food out until the plague takes them.A number of them come in from the street as well.They seem to understand that we will feed them at least a little.This explains why we saw none on our way over, Feng put in.Its difficult to come up with enough food for everyone without arousing suspicion, Adames concluded.Alice pulled off her glove and put her left hand on Adamess arm.The spiders eyes glowed green.You dont have the plague, she said.He looked down at the spider with a mixture of curiosity and uncertainty.I wouldnt, no.I caught it as a child and survived.He pulled back the sleeve on his robe, revealing a scarred, withered arm.Alices face tightened, and Gavin knew she was remembering her father, also scarred by the clockwork plague.My mother said I owed God, so I entered the priesthood.One of the patients cried out in pain from her bed.Berta turned, but Alice pushed past her.Gavin, I want you with me.Please?Gavin shrugged out of the heavy backpack, set the whip down, and accepted his fiddle case from Alice.While he was taking the fiddle out, something occurred to him.Alice, when did you last sleep?I caught a few hours when you were in that fugue state in the train car, she said absently, bending over the first bed.Just play for me.Its all the rest I need.He played, and Alice led him around the room.She drew back white sheets and slashed each patient as gently as she could, spraying a bit of her own blood into the wounds while Gavin spilled liquid harmony from the strings.With Adames in the room, he felt nervous, pressured to play without making a mistake, even though he was sure the priest would never notice.I once had a heart as good as new  But now its gone from me to you.For a moment he was somewhere else.His mother was sitting in a rocking chair, holding a baby in her lap, and the man with pale hair his father was teaching Gavin a song.The fingers that pressed against the familiar strings felt tiny, and the gut bit into them.Keep trying.Once day, youll play better than your old man, but only if you do better.The moon picked you from all the rest  For I loved you best.Where had his father gone?Was he dead?Had he run away?But why?He wanted answers, though the questions had only recently come to him.Maybe the plague was awakening old memories, or maybe he just wanted to remember now, painful as it was.Other longings rushed in, filled him like water in cupped hands.He wanted to hear his fathers voice, touch his hand, be a son instead of a grandson, protegee, or cabin boy.The memory faded, though he continued playing.Once his bow quivered and he made a mistake.A note F came out with a squeak, far below proper pitch.Gavins face went hot.He corrected and moved on as if nothing had happened.Had Adames noticed?Had Alice?Or even Feng?None of them reacted.Gavin continued to playing, forcing himself to concentrate harder.By the time Alice got to the last patient, the first one was sitting up and speaking.Berta hurried over with a cup of water.Incredible, Adames breathed.Dear Lord, it is a miracle.The Consolatrix come to life.Feng surreptitiously wiped at his eyes.That was the saddest I have ever heard you play.Gavin gave him a wan smile.Perhaps he hadnt noticed the error, then.Still, he felt a little sick.It was stupid, he knew, but he couldnt shake the feeling that someone was watching, counting up every mistake, and one day he would be called to account for them.Now, take me to the catacombs, Alice said, but she was weaving.Gavin put his fiddle in its case.You can barely stand.How much blood have you given up in the last two days?She hesitated.The jar, then, she said.In my pack.Feng set a stool behind her, and she sank onto it while Gavin pulled the jar from her pack without bothering to remove it from her back first.The fireflies glowed faintly within the glass.You rest, Gavin said.Let Berta bring you something to eat.Monsignor Adames can take me to help the zombies.Leaving Alice under Fengs watchful eye, Gavin followed the priest out the pivoting door and down a short flight of steps.The catacombs are almost directly under the altar, Adames said, brandishing his candle.When I conduct Mass, I sometimes wonder how the parishioners would respond if they knew what lies beneath their feet.Prepare yourself, my son.He pulled open a thick door.It exhaled air heavy with rot and fear.Gavin let the darkness swallow him as they moved inside, though the fireflies provided pale green light.Niches carved into the walls like short beds held dry skeletons, many with ragged cloth still clinging to them.Some clutched rosaries in yellowed fingers while the skulls stared eyelessly at the ceiling, the leavings of death.Gavin shrank away from them, not wanting to touch.He felt like an intruder, one who would be caught and thrown out by some monstrous gatekeeper at any moment.He followed Adamess candle down a side passage until he heard shuffling footsteps ahead.Bones clattered with a sound that crawled over Gavins skin.Ahead, he saw the passage widen, and a shadowy group of zombies huddled in the dark.They shielded their eyes from the candle with ragged arms and groaned like a choir of uneasy spirits.Two of them lay sprawled on the floor, motionless.Dead.Gavin flinched at the sight.If they had arrived a day ago, an hour ago, a minute ago, could they have been saved?There was never enough time.If only there was a way to make more.Gavin thought about what Adames had said as they entered the catacomb.He saw wealthy ladies in silk skirts and gentlemen in fine coats, their stomachs filled with a good breakfast prepared by paid servants.They spoke in hushed voices and smiled quietly to one another, their soft faces scrubbed pink, while below them moaned hungry, sick people.What can you do for them?Adames asked.The priests voice pulled Gavin back he had nearly fallen into another fugue.With an embarrassed cough, he stepped farther into the bone room, opened the gleaming jar, and waved a dozen of the fireflies out of it.They streaked through the darkness and landed on some of the zombies.What are they?the priest asked.Im not completely sure, Gavin said.Alices aunt made them.They spread the cure, and anyone they bite spreads the cure as well.Alices cure works faster, but shes not strong enough to help everyone.How will they get out once theyre better?One of the zombies reached a tentative hand toward Adames, who handed it a chunk of bread from his pocket.The creature fumbled to accept it and eat.The same way they get in through the graveyard.Theres an entrance in one of the mausoleums.Are you sure this will.?Yes.He looked around, feeling suddenly uneasy.I think we should get back to   A crash thundered through the catacomb and vibrated the very stones.The candle danced in Adamess hand.Gavin swore.They found us!he said.Adames was already heading for the door.Who?The brass demons.We have to run!They met Feng and Berta at the spiral staircase.Berta had Gavins backpack, and a worried looking Feng was half carrying Alice.Gavin cursed himself for letting her push herself so hard.Another crash thundered overhead.Wordlessly Gavin yanked on the battery backpack, slapped the whip onto his belt, and snatched Alice out of Fengs arms.The clockwork plague roared through him, and he barely noticed her weight as he bundled her up the stairs.She clutched the firefly jar to her chest.At the top, he burst out of the transept and into the crossing of the cathedral, the enormous open space just in front of the altar where the Consolatrix stood on her crescent moon.Two of the priceless stained glass windows, one on each of the long walls of the nave, had been shattered, and the confessional booths standing beneath them were smashed to flinders, crushed beneath stomping metal feet.Standing in the nave, the echoing pillared hall where the congregation gathered for services, were the two mechanicals, their glass bubbles gleaming like captured moons.In front of them was Lieutenant Phipps.Her brass monocle stared coldly about the pale brown chamber.How did you find us?Alice gasped.The good fathers secret hospital isnt as secret as he likes to think, Phipps said in a scornful tone.The Ward has known of it for quite some time.It was just a matter of watching until you showed up with your cure as you did.This is a house of God!Adames roared, and before Gavin could stop him, he rushed forward to confront Phipps.One of the mechanicals Glenda leaned forward and almost casually knocked him aside.Adames slammed into a pillar and slid moaning to the stony floor.Nshi shenme dngxi!Feng exclaimed.A chill rage fell over Gavin, burning away all other emotion.Why?You are criminals, Phipps said through tight teeth.You released a doomsday weapon and broke a dangerous clockworker out of custody.You are a menace to society, and I will bring you to justice.We dont want to hurt you, Gavin, Simon said.Just just come, all right?Youll get a fair trial.Why did you hurt the priest?Gavins voice was level and deadly.He helped more people in one day than your Empire has in a hundred years.Im not here to debate, Ennock.Youre under arrest.The lieutenant dipped into her pockets and came up with the tuning forks.Time slowed.Gavin saw the length of the metal forks, heard the creak of the mechanicals joints, felt the weight of the cathedral ceiling high above.His hand moved smoothly down impulses contracted muscle, shortened tendons, curled fingers and came up with the whip.He stepped forward and swung.The lash sliced through the air.He saw the individual currents split and eddy away as the braid hissed them to pieces.At precisely the right moment, Gavin flicked his arm and the lash changed direction.Air swirled like water, and the tip of the lash broke an invisible barrier.Sound cracked as the tip flicked across the fork in Phippss right hand.The fork shattered.Phipps cried out and jumped back.Get Alice out of here, Gavin barked over his shoulder at Feng.What are you waiting for?Phipps snarled at Simon and Glenda.Grab them!Grab her!No.With one hand, Gavin drew his glass cutlass.With the other, he pressed the whips power switch.Blue energy flowed along the lash.He slashed the air, leaving a sizzling azure trail.You wont get past me.Glendas mechanical lunged for him, but Gavin heard the pistons hiss, saw the machines posture change, felt the tiny shift of air, and he was already moving.He whirled the lash and struck the mechanicals arm.Sparks flew where the braided alloy touched brass, sending a small jolt up Gavins arm, but the cut was clean.The arm thudded to the stone floor.Before Glenda could react, Gavin swung again, catching the mechanical at the shin.The mechanical, caught in midstep, lurched forward, leaving the lower part of one leg behind.She stumbled, fell sideways, and crashed into a pillar.It cracked, and bits of it crumbled.Glenda crashed face first to the ground.Her glass bubble shattered, and Gavin caught the tail end of her scream.The cold anger, however, let him feel no mercy or remorse.Behind Gavin, Feng was hauling Alice toward one of the side alcoves and an exit, the firefly jar still in her hands.Simon raised his mechanicals hand.The fingers clicked together into a gun barrel.He fired something over Gavins head with a whump that thudded hard against Gavins eardrums.The munition smashed into a pair of statues over the alcove and shattered them.Chunks of stone fell in front of the alcove entrance, throwing up a choking cloud of dust and blocking any exit.Alice cried out, and Feng pulled back.Dont touch her, Simon!Gavin snarled.A skin of black ice encased his heart, and he flicked the lash, but Simons mechanical was out of range.Phipps pointed a metal finger at Gavin.He heard the tiny fft, and barely brought up the glass cutlass in time to catch the dart.It shattered on the tempered glass.Youve lost your edge, Susan, he said evenly.Im not a piece of street trash anymore.Im a clockworker now, more dangerous than you can understand.And more arrogant, she said.Ive captured dozens of your kind, boy, some who wanted to destroy the world.Mere pirate toys dont measure up.With that, she leaped at him, faster than a human should have moved.It caught Gavin by surprise, and then she was inside the circle of the lash, where the whip couldnt touch her.Her metal arm batted aside Gavins glass cutlass and she gut punched him with the other hand.The air burst from him, but he didnt feel pain.Not yet.He grabbed her wrist (ninety seven pounds of pressure), twisted upward (joint bending at 110 degrees), and planted his foot behind hers.To his left (nine feet, five inches), the cutlass clattered on the floor.With a flick, he brought his foot up to upset Phipps   but she was already gone, leaping backward and away.She snapped her metallic left hand open, and a lash of her own snaked out of the palm.Gavin slapped it aside with the lash, and only then   Gavin!Look out!did he realize it was a diversion.Simons mechanical stepped forward and almost delicately grabbed Gavins backpack.With easy strength he hoisted Gavin aloft.Simons face looked pale through the glass.Gavin swung the lash as his feet dangled over empty air.The whip wrapped around Simons forearm, but the blue glow flickered and died, drained of power.No, he whispered.Youre mine, Ennock, Phipps said from below.Actually, hes mine, Susan, Alice called from beside the half conscious Glenda amid the wreckage of the mechanical.With a deft motion, she spun a clockwork gear through the air at Simon.It trailed a pair of wires from Glendas machinery.Simon twisted in his chair in time to see, but not to react.The gear clanged against his mechanicals shoulder.Electricity snapped and sparked.Ladders of it arced up and down the mechanicals body, and inside it, Simon convulsed and shuddered.Gavin, who wasnt touching metal, felt nothing.The mechanicals fist opened, and Gavin dropped to the ground as Simon and his mechanical collapsed noisily to the cathedral floor.The backpack smashed Gavin flat, knocking the breath out of him just as Phippss punch had.Youve lost your toys, Alice panted, and youve lost us.Theres no point in pursuing this, Susan.You havent earned the right to call me by my Christian name, girl.Phipps was standing upright a few paces from the wrecked machinery, cool and unruffled, and for a moment Gavin was getting another dressing down in her office back at Third Ward headquarters in London.She leaned a little toward Gavin and inhaled deeply, then nodded to herself, as if confirming something.From the floor she plucked a bit of stone from the cracked column and with her metal hand threw it with quiet nonchalance.It shattered a single pane of stained glass above the altar at the other end of the cathedral.I wonder, she said, and threw another piece.It broke the pane next to the first one.I wonder who your ally is.That man whos keeping to the shadows so I dont see his face.It occurs to me that the son of the Chinese ambassador vanished from London at the same time you fled.Is that he?I like his infrared pattern.She tapped her monocle.He has a very interesting jar in one hand and a pistol in the other, but he wont fire, either because hes too cowardly or because Im not attacking you right now.Which is it, boy?Feng, wherever he was, didnt answer.Phipps threw two more pieces, shattering two more priceless panes.Stop it!Alice said.Its senseless!Let God stop me.If He cares.She threw more and more pieces, and each one blacked out a piece of glass.I could hit you easily enough, you know.No, Gavin said.He had dropped the backpack and snatched up the cutlass again.His hands were steady as icicles.You couldnt.Youre probably right.Clockworker reflexes.Toss.Smash.Those reflexes and that strength come at a price, you know.The plague burning through your bodys resources.Toss.Smash.How does it feel, Ennock, knowing that the plague is devouring your brain from the inside out?How does it feel to know you wont last the year with your lady love?Toss, smash.How does it feel to know that shell cry over your grave for a while and move on to someone else?She already left one man.Her words were light as pebbles, but they slammed Gavin with the force of cannonballs.His grip on the cutlass loosened, and he only just remembered to keep it ready.Youre just trying to make me feel bad.Of course, Phipps replied conversationally.Toss.Smash.I want you to feel bad about what youre doing, Gavin, because it is bad.Youve done wrong.You are doing wrong.Dont listen to her!Alice gasped from the safety of her mechanical barricade.The rush that had carried her through the fight was wearing off, and it was clear she was struggling to stay conscious.Phipps flicked a rock in her direction, but Alice ducked into the mechanical, and it pinged off metal.Gavins anger started up again.Phipps interrupted it.You know Im right, Gavin.Its bloody scary out here.Chaotic.Difficult.Imperfect.So many choices, so many paths, so many roads, and no resources to help with them.You always miss the mark.Silence!Feng called from the shadows.Or I shoot.If you were going to shoot, you would have, Phipps countered.Youre a coward, Feng.Otherwise you would have stood up to your father when he said he planned to send you home in disgrace.But you know that, dont you, Feng?Its why youre slinking home like a castrated dog with his tail tucked between his legs.The longer you stay with these people, the worse it will become, you know.They dont appreciate you.Theyre bringing you home to your doom.Quiet!Alice was trying to shout, but the words came out in a harsh whisper that spun through the room and wrapped themselves around the Consolatrix.Feng didnt respond, but Gavin thought he heard a choked sound from the shadows.Toss, smash.Phipps turned back to Gavin.You can build whatever you want at the Ward, Gavin.Its calm there.Quiet.Patterned.Perfect.Every day, every room, every meal.No chaos, no confusion, no disorder.Come back to us.You wont hang for treason, not if youre a clockworker.We like you, want you, need you.Her words, her tone, her ideas were hypnotic as music.He remembered the underground rooms where the clockworkers lived and worked at Third Ward headquarters, their regular stonework walls, the patterns, the perfect schedule.When he was training as an agent, hed found the required regularity difficult, even stifling, but now it sounded attractive, even alluring.The world would make sense there.Gavin realized he had sheathed the cutlass and taken a step toward Phipps.Gavin!Alice croaked.Dont!Its beautiful down there now, Phipps cooed.Weve already made repairs after what you did, after what you hurt, after what you destroyed.We made it pretty and patterned and perfect.Patterns within patterns, spirals within spirals.No worries, no troubles, no cares.No fear, no dread, no fright.Just the machines.Orderly, mannerly, heavenly machines.Her words wrapped him in warm velvet.It would be so fine to have a place where he didnt have to think and plan all the time, where worries evaporated, where patterns ruled.What had he been thinking, running away from all that in the first place?He was vaguely aware of someone, another woman, shouting something at him, and the shadowy figure of a man stepping out of the darkness, but Phipps, beautiful, kind Phipps, flipped a stone at the man, and he retreated.Phipps always hit her mark.The shouting womans words washed past him like tiny waves, easily ignored.He took another step.We can give you a cure, you know, Phipps said.I told you before we had more cures than the one Edwina created in the Doomsday Vault.We can cure clockworkers, too.This jolted Gavin.The perfection cracked, the velvet vanished, and he realized he was nearly face to face with Phipps.Cure?There is no cure for clockworkers.Too late Phipps saw her mistake.Her single eye blinked rapidly.Of course not, of course not.What I meant was that you can look for a cure.The Ward has resources, anything you need to find one, seek one, look for   Youre very good, Gavin said quietly.Distract, pacify, capture, right?Thats the pattern.We do it with Dr.Clef all the time, except we use Click.Phipps narrowed her eye.Ill take you now, boy.No, you wont.Without Glenda and Simon, youre outnumbered and outmatched, and if you touch me, Feng really will shoot.You wanted me to go with you on my own.I wont, Susan.Youll put my head in a noose.I want justice, boy, she hissed.I want whats right.You destroyed my empire and even now you hurt Simon and Glenda.Leave, Susan, Gavin told her.You let me walk away from the Doomsday Vault, so Ill let you do the same here.Next time Ill probably change my mind.Because youll be completely mad?Go, Susan.You wont get your justice today.For a long moment, she stared at him.Then she tossed one final bit of column at the stained glass, turned on her heel, and stalked out.Heart tight with worry, Gavin ran over to Alice.She had slumped over inside the mechanical wreckage, looking pale and delicate as paper with the spider gauntlet weighing her down, but she blinked up at him when he leaned into the machinery.Simon sprawled beside her, unconscious but breathing.Thank God they were all right.The thought of Alice getting hurt made him cold inside and out, and Simon well, even now he still thought of Simon as a friend.Can you walk, Alice?Gavin said.We shouldnt stay.I think I can manage for a bit, she replied.Those last few moments took a lot out of me.You were magnificent, he blurted.Incredible!Funny, she said softly, I was going to say the same, Mr.Ennock.Your little friend will live, Feng called from Glendas mechanical.But she will have a dragons headache when she wakes up.Should we tie them up?With what?Gavin helped Alice out of the mechanical.Hows the priest?But Berta had already arrived and was helping Monsignor Adames to his feet.He held his side and his face was pinched with pain.Two of your ribs are cracked and it is possible a third is broken, Berta said, and her mechanized voice managed to sound concerned.You must come downstairs so I can wrap them.Adames waved her off.Not yet.His breath came in gasps.Alice and Gavin have to know.I saw I saw the world coming to an end in flood and plague.He panted with the effort of speaking.Dear God, the pain.Your ribs, Berta began.Not my pain, he gasped.The worlds.So many people will die if you fail, Alice.Millions upon millions.Alice struggled to more alertness.Me?You must not fail, Adames said.God has shown me.Oh, He has.Im so sorry.Something in his tone made Gavin uneasy.Sorry?Your trials arent over, my children.He was leaning heavily on Berta now.Flood and plague will destroy us if you dont cure the world.Thats my intent, Alice said, holding up her gauntleted hand.Adames shook his head.Not you.Gavin.Me?Gavin started.But Alice has the spider, and her aunt made the fireflies.Thats not what God showed me, Adames repeated stubbornly.You will cure the world, and Alice Alice must let go.Let go?Alice asked.Let go of what?He shook his head.Im sorry.Its not its not like looking in a picture.Its a dream that I know is real.Oh, Alice.Your love destroyed an empire.Now it will destroy the world as well.Gavins mouth went dry.Alice froze.No, she whispered.You have to let him go, Alice, Adames gasped out.You have to release him or the world will die.A crowd was gathering outside the enormous church, summoned by the noise.They pointed and stared at the shattered windows, but seemed unsure whether they should go inside or not.Gavin carried Alice, who was too weak to stand, and tried to blend in.Hed been forced to leave the depowered backpack behind, but he kept the lash and his cutlass and had stuffed his fiddle into Alices pack.Feng had the firefly jar.Alice felt disturbingly light in Gavins arms as he worked his way toward the back of the crowd around the church, and the spider gauntlet lay inert in her lap, though its eyes glowed red when it brushed against Gavins chest.Flood and plague will destroy us if you dont cure the world.What the hell did that mean?Gavin had never been particularly religious, and minister and priest were really no different than musician, really.Their words spun people into other worlds just like music did.Priests has no more power than Gavin himself.Yet Monsignor Adamess words chased after him.Your love has destroyed an empire.Now it will destroy the world.He looked down at her in the near darkness as they moved through the bewildered people with Feng close by him.Those last words chilled him.Neither Gavin nor Alice had mentioned the Doomsday Vault or how the cure would eventually destroy the British Empire to Adames, and Phipps had said something only after Glenda had knocked Adames unconscious.He couldnt have known, but he did know.What did that mean for the rest of his words?The crowd pressed tighter around them, pointing and staring.We must bring her back to the circus, Feng said in his ear.Its all about destruction, Gavin muttered, pulling Alice tighter to him.It was getting harder to move.Never creation.Even when we create, we destroy.Gavin, Feng said.He shook his head.I know, I know.Im not fugueing.Just thinking out   No.Feng pointed.Look.Feng, and most of the other people in the heavy crowd, were pointing at the stained glass windows at the back of the nave, the panes Phipps had flung casual stones at.The broken panes formed a pattern, one Gavin hadnt noticed backward, inside the church.Outside, the broken glass formed a clear symbol: v2.The signature of the Third Ward, Gavin said.What is the significance?Feng asked.He was still clutching the firefly jar.Its a message.Phipps isnt giving up, and she has the power to touch even the church.Gavin!Phippss voice carried through the churchyard loud and clear.Alarm speared Gavins chest and he held Alice tight.One last gift for you and your friends.At the last moment he spotted her on a shadowy window ledge above the crowds head.She had a pebble in her mechanical hand, and she threw.Fearful for Alice, Gavin spun, shielding her with his body.But instead of feeling the bite of stone on flesh, he only heard one more note of shattered glass.Feng stood next to him, the pieces of destroyed jar in his hands.Blood ran from a cut on his arm.A chill ran over Gavin.No!he whispered.The cloud of fireflies hovered in place for a moment, keeping the shape of the jar.Then they scattered, swarming over the crowd, streaking green starlight in a thousand different directions.The people scattered, yipping and slapping.Hundreds of dead fireflies dropped to the ground, crushed by hands and stomped by feet.Damn you!Gavin cried at the church.But Phipps was already gone.Interlude  When will you be well enough to travel?Phipps asked.Glenda lay propped up in her hotel room bed with a steak on her eye and her arm in a sling.I dont know.Three days, perhaps four.Im sorry, Lieutenant.I should be sorry, Agent Teasdale.Im your commander, and I let you down.Since Glenda had the bed, Simon occupied her customary place in the chair.Im not feeling very well myself, he said.We wrecked a church, Lieutenant.A church that violated a number of laws regarding human shaped automatons and the illegal sheltering of plague victims.Monsignor Adames knew the risks, Phipps replied, fighting to remain calm.This was the second time Gavin and Alice had slipped away from her, and she hated looking the fool.She was also fighting to push aside a growing unease that Simon had a point.In any case, Im sure the amount of money he scavenges from the wrecked mechanicals will more than compensate him.A church, Lieutenant, Simon repeated.How do we justify   A knock interrupted him.Simon answered the door and returned with a letter addressed to Phipps.She had a good idea what it was about, and reading the heavy paper inside only confirmed her suspicion.Its from the office of the grand duke, she said.The gendarmerie is no longer available to assist us in our enquiries and we have been asked, in the politest manner possible, to leave Luxembourg as soon as we are able.I suspected as much.Why did you break that jar?Glenda asked.Phipps almost grimaced and stopped herself.Breaking the jar had been a mistake, her temper getting the better of her.She had no idea what the jar had contained, only that it was somehow valuable to Gavin and Alice, and the final pebble in her hand had been too much of a temptation there in the shadow of the church.Lately, it was harder and harder to keep her emotions in check.How could she know if her decisions were based on logic or emotion when she was angry all the time?She was fighting for what was just, as Father had taught, and Father was never wrong.As long as she did that, she herself could not be wrong.Never let an opponent think he has the upper hand, even when hes handed you a setback, she said in an explanation that sounded lame even to herself.Better to take a small victory.Hm, said Glenda.So what now?Simon asked, a little warily.Once Glenda can travel again, we will follow that circus.Simon blinked.The Kalakos Circus?The gendarmes searched there and found nothing.Of course they didnt.Alice was out and about on her little mission at the time, and circus performers wont admit anything to the police.Then how do you know theyre with the circus?Glenda asked.Didnt you catch the scent of peanuts and cooked sugar on Gavin when we were in the church?It was all over him, Phipps replied.Hes hiding there, all right.Unfortunately, we cant confront them now, not with Glenda injured and the mechanicals destroyed.And the gendarmerie unhappy with us, Simon put in.True.Fortunately, while you were out fetching the steak, Simon, I was able to make some enquiries.The circus plans to spend some time in Berlin, and from there it will travel to Kiev.Glenda sat up straighter, and winced.The Ukrainian Empire?Are they mad?It will be an absolute hell, Phipps agreed.Chapter Seven  The world rocked and wobbled.Alice tossed about, trying to make everything settle down, and finally she came fully awake.It came to her that she was lying on her narrow bunk in her stateroom on The Lady of Liberty.She wore a nightgown and cap, and the blankets lay heavy atop her.How had she come to be here?The last thing she remembered was Gavin carrying her out of the ruined church.The room continued to sway, more like a train than the Ladys usual stately glide, and Alices sleep addled mind finally remembered the day she had helped fit the airship with train wheels and hook her up to the circus train.They must be under way.Mindful of the low ceiling, she sat up as the door slid open and Kemp entered with a tea tray.So glad to see you awake, Madam, he said brightly.I thought you might be hungry.The sight of food and drink awoke a leonine appetite, and Alice gratefully accepted the tray.Tea, fresh bread, butter and jam, soft boiled eggs, and liver?Kemp knew very well she hated liver, and it was completely unlike him to serve her food she disliked, but when the smell reached her, something primal took over.She snatched up fork and knife and crammed in mouthfuls, heedless of ladylike manners.The spider gauntlet on her left hand clinked softly against the flatware.I noticed the change in your heartbeat and respiration, Kemp said, answering a question she hadnt asked, and stepped out to prepare a meal.Sir said you had lost a fair amount of blood, and the proper remedy for that is tea and liver.Alice swallowed a mouthful.How long was I asleep?Nearly two days, Madam.I urge you to drink as much as you can.Thank you, Kemp.As always, I dont know what I would do without you.His eyes glowed.You are quite welcome, Madam.In anticipation of your next question, Sir is in the workshop with the doctor.Shall I alert him to your present state?Not if hes in a fugue.Alice tapped an egg with her spoon and unwound the shell.Where are we?Whats been going on?We left Luxembourg late last night.Ringmaster Dodd became nervous at the number of mingers, as he calls them, patrolling the streets to look for you.In any case, their presence seemed to have a dampening effect on the number of people who attended performances.So we are moving on to Berlin.I believe the local baron is giving a birthday party for his son and he wants a circus.Eventually, of course, we will travel on to Kiev.Alice glanced out the porthole.Greenery rocked past in a blur, and the engine gave a long, low whistle.Sharp coal smoke and cinders mingled with the scent of liver and eggs.She remembered traveling by rail with her father and mother and brother and eating on tall sided trays just like this one.Mother always bought a large bag of peppermint candies and shared them with Alice and Brent.Father sniffed that he didnt care for peppermint, but pinched pieces outrageously and made Alice giggle.Then Mother assigned Alice the task of counting cows in the fields they passed while Brent was to count sheep.Father joked that it was faster to count all their legs and divide by four, which made Alice giggle all over again and lose count.That had been in happier times, in the days before the clockwork plague struck her family, sending her mother and brother to the graveyard and twisting her fathers body into a wheelchair.She held up the dark spider gauntlet for a moment.Her blood still coursed through the tubules.What would happen if she cut the tubes, sliced off its legs until it had nothing to grip with?It wouldnt be difficult, just time consuming.But the spider moved with her perfectly, responding to every muscle twitch far more efficiently than a simple glove.How deeply had it bonded to her and how much would it damage her own flesh to cut it off?She pushed the questions aside to finish her breakfast, wash up, and dress, opting for a simple blouse and skirt and not bothering with a corset.Her legs were a bit shaky.Sharing the blood cure was difficult, time consuming, and physically draining, and although the people Alice cured would themselves spread the cure with every cough and sneeze, it took time, time, and more time to get the cure to those who needed it, and every day it took was another day someone elses mother, father, or brother died.There had to be a faster way.The fireflies would help, of course, since they could fly and spread things even faster, but they had their limitations as well.They couldnt cross an ocean or mountain range, and chance or nature might destroy all the ones in a particular area before they had the chance to do much good.Still, they were helpful, and would take some of the burden off Alice.She would have to make more use of them in the future.That decided, Alice left Kemp to tidy up her room while she went off in search of Gavin.Out in the corridor, however, she encountered a seething mass of metal.A brass flock of whirligigs flitted and hovered in the air while spiders scampered back and forth over the corridor floor.They jumped and squeaked when Alice emerged, and crowded around her.She laughed, and put out a hand.Two whirligigs landed on her arm, and spiders crawled up her body to her shoulders and head.All right, all right.She laughed again.Im glad to see all of you, too.Good heavens.The little automatons refused to leave her sight, so Alice wore them like odd flowers or jewelry as she went off in search of Gavin.She tapped on the laboratory door and slid it open.Gavin, clad in a leather coat and goggles, turned to glance at her.His eyes widened, and he dodged away with a yelp and snatched up a beaker, ready to throw.Alice backed away.Gavin!Whats wrong?Whirliblades chopping the chaos into wrong patterns, he babbled.So much fluff.Her heart lurched.He wasnt a snapping, snarling monster, but the nonsense wasnt much better.Gavin, its me, she pleaded.Snap out of it!His blue eyes swam behind the lenses and he was breathing fast.Gently, she pulled the goggles off and touched his face.When had she last really touched him, just to touch him?His handsome face, so young but so old at the same time, felt warm and a little raspy under her palm.She wanted to take this mans hand and run with him somewhere safe, to a place where there was no plague, no machinery, no ticking clock.Just the two of them.He grabbed the back of her hand and pressed it harder against his face.Alice?His voice was normal, and she felt better for it.Its me, darling.What are you wearing?You look like a knight who went through a threshing machine.She laughed for the third time that day and turned.Do you like it?Give it time, and whirligigs and spiders will become the latest rage.Youre beautiful in everything, Lady Michaels.The sincerity in his voice made her blush.Well.For that, you may have a kiss.She meant it to be a quick peck, but she found herself wrapped in his arms.The whirligigs and spiders exploded away from her in a startled cloud, and Gavins entire body pressed against hers.He ran his hands through her hair and down her back as his mouth came down on hers.The world swirled away, and her entire universe became nothing but him.She felt his muscles move on hers, and felt his hardness press against her.Her body throbbed in response.She ran her own hands over him, touching his jaw, his smooth collarbone, the ripples on his chest and stomach.Her breath quickened as oh God, how daring could she be she explored lower and touched his erection.He groaned against her teeth as her hand traced its length through his clothing, and his arms tightened around her.Her skin felt feathery, and she wanted to pull Gavin into her, make him part of her and never let him go.Alice, he whispered hoarsely, oh God, Alice.I dont We have to stop now or  Or what?she whispered back.Or we have to keep going.She moved her hand again, fascinated and excited by his length and hardness, by the reactions and gasps of pleasure her touch elicited in Gavin, and she ached for his hands on her, but he was barely moving now, as if he were afraid he might explode.He gave another groan...should we keep going?he murmured.Can we?She knew what he was talking about.A baby.If she got pregnant now, before they found a cure for Gavin, the baby would grow up without a father.That would destroy Gavin, not to mention what it would do to her.Further, an illegitimate child would also be unable to inherit her title, and despite all the traditions she had flouted, this one she wasnt willing to give up.It would be so easy to take him back to her stateroom, put him on the bunk and help him undress.She wanted to see him, feel him, touch him skin to skin, no barriers between them.And no one would know, or care if they did.Her body hungered for him.But no.She had flouted any number of traditions, but this one This one she wasnt ready to forego yet.She dropped her hands and turned aside.Gavin swallowed, then turned his back so he could adjust his clothes.When he turned around again, she couldnt help reaching out to brush his white blond hair back into place, and she nearly leaped into his arms again.Im sorry.With effort, she pulled her hand back.I wish there was some way we could  Well live, he said.But you wont, she couldnt help adding to herself.I can save everyone else.Why cant I save you?The little automatons were still hovering in the doorway, some of them literally.Alice shooed them off.What happened while I was asleep?Kemp told me only a little.He turned back to the efficient worktable, upon which perched a new machine the size of a shoe box.A speaking trumpet was affixed to the top, and a crank stuck out of the side.One side of the box was open, and a few stray pieces lay on the table with some tools.Alice craned her neck to see what the machinery inside was for, but the angle was bad, and Gavins body blocked the way.Lets see.Gavin picked up a screwdriver and set to work with it.After Phipps broke the firefly jar, we got back to   She what?Alice cried.He set down the screwdriver.You didnt know?No!Alices knees went weak, but there was no place to sit down.She leaned on the worktable instead.How do you mean it broke?Phipps threw a rock.All the fireflies flew away, though they bit a lot of people first.Im sorry, Alice.I thought you were still awake when it happened.Dear God.She looked down at the spider gauntlet on her left hand.No possibility of cutting it off now.The escaped fireflies would infect a number of Flemish, but only a few of them would travel beyond their homes, and it would take years for the cure to reach around the world without artificial means.She had planned to release a few fireflies in every city they passed through, hastening the cures movement, but now  Im all of it, Alice said.I have to spread the cure as far as I can now.Gavin set his face and went back to work with the screwdriver.You can only do so much, Alice.I have to do what I can.I have to save them, Gavin.It wont do the world any good if you kill yourself in the process.Despair crashed over her, extinguishing her earlier arousal.What should I do, then?Every day I malinger in bed, recovering from curing people, someone else dies.Im working on a way to help.Gavin tightened the last piece of machinery and closed up the box.There!Alice blew her nose into a handkerchief and dabbed at her eyes, a little miffed that Gavin wasnt offering more sympathy, but also curious about the machine.What is it?I call it a paradox generator.But I cant actually use it.Not directly.What?Why not?Alice drew back.Will it destroy the world or something?I hope not.Gavin snagged a set of ear protectors similar to the ones Alice had seen Aunt Edwina use back in London.But if it works, itll Look, I cant explain it.Lets take it up top and Ill show you.The wind on the main deck was fierce.It blew Alices hair and skirts straight behind her and roared in her ears.The disguised airship was the last and tallest car on the train, so there wasnt even any shelter from the brightly painted boxcar ahead of them.Far up the track, a plume of black smoke blew from the engines stack backward over the rest of the train.Ash and cinders clogged the air.The little automatons, afraid of being blown away, stayed below.Gavin took Alices hand and brought her to a three sided, roofed shanty that had apparently been erected on the deck while she had been asleep.The opening faced the leeward side, allowing them to stand out of the wind but still be outdoors.In the shanty was Dr.Clef, who was scribbling in a notebook.Click sat beside him, but he ran over to rub against Alices legs.Alice picked him up and cooed at him, eliciting his mechanical purr.So good to see you up and moving, my young treasure.I have kept your clicky kitty wound for you, said Dr.Clef over his pencil.He face and hands were gray with soot.I find the fresh air helps me think, dont you?At that moment, a particularly thick cloud of cinders engulfed the shanty before being blown to shreds by the wind.Alice coughed over Clicks back into her much abused handkerchief.Fresh air.Hm.What are we doing up here, Gavin?Just listen.He set the new machine down and pulled the protectors over his ears.They were wooden cups stuffed with wool, apparently designed to keep out sound.Then he turned the machines crank.From the speaking trumpet emerged an unearthly sound.It sounded like a chorus of ghosts sighing from high to low and low to high all at once.Gavin continued turning, and the sound repeated endlessly.The pitch rose higher and higher and higher and fell lower and lower and lower, but it never seemed to reach the top or bottom of any scale.It turned endlessly, the tonal equivalent of a figure eight, always moving and going nowhere.It made Alices skin crawl.I dont understand, she said when he stopped.Gavin pulled the protectors off his ears.I think I broke Dr.Clef.Dr.Clef sat motionless.He stared into space without blinking, and only the faintest breath fluttered from his chest.A line of spittle drooled down the side of his mouth.The engine blew its whistle, high and shrill.Good heavens.Alice shook Dr.Clefs shoulders, and he didnt respond.Gavin handed her a bottle of smelling salts, and she opened it under his nose.He coughed awake and waved the bottle away.Where am I, then?he asked.What is happening?I think only Gavin can explain that, Alice said.Gavin gestured to the new machine.It generates a tritone paradox, he said.Kind of hard to explain.The machine plays a one octave scale that goes down and another that goes up.When the machine reaches the top of the ascending scale, it drops back down to the bottom and starts over, but the volume changes so that you dont notice the switch.It does the same for the descending scale.But then things really get interesting.Its just a noise, Alice said doubtfully.Click squirmed in her arms, so she set him down.Not really, Gavin said.The machine also adds another pair of ascending/descending scales, but those are a tritone above the first two.It creates the illusion of a sound thats always going up or always going down it depends on your ear but it never actually goes anywhere.Clockworkers, though, are sensitive to tritones and have perfect pitch    so it creates an unsolvable paradox for us, Dr.Clef put in.And the addition of the other tones does away with the pain and makes the entire scale hypnotic.I remember only a lovely sound that  Wait!Wait!He clapped his hands and his face flushed.Du Lieber!Ach, das ist ja nicht zu glauben!Wie habe ich das verpa?t?Whats wrong, Doctor?Alice asked.What did you miss?This tritone paradox is an auditory version of my Impossible Cube!Play it again!Play it now!Just a moment, Alice said, holding up a hand.We dont know everything this does yet.Is it harmful?I dont know, Gavin replied.It seems to have helped Dr.Clef.Hes talking to me instead of arguing.Why, so I am!Dr.Clef exclaimed.We should be fighting, yet we are not.I am filled with goodwill toward you, my boy.What an amazing thing!Did you create it just for this purpose?So that we can work together?No, Gavin said.I created it because I think its possible to slow time.There followed a long, long pause.Wind whistled through the cracks in the shanty walls, and Clicks steel wool tongue rasped as he cleaned his paws.Sorry, Alice said.Did you say ?Its possible to slow time, Gavin repeated.How?Dr.Clef said in a low, steady voice.With your new alloy, Dr.Clef.Gavin gestured at the rolled up wiring that still lay on the deck.I saw your calculations, the ones that prove gravity distorts time.Dr.Clef held up a finger.That is not quite correct.I proved that time isnt a constant.The flow of time speeds up or slows down based on a number of forces, including the power of gravity, but we dont notice because were in whatever passes for local time.If you could somehow put a clock two or three thousand miles above the surface of the planet, for example, within a few days you will find it is running faster because Earths gravity is weaker up there.Time for an object also changes based on how fast it moves.I have reason to believe though I have not yet proved it mathematically that if you could somehow accelerate to the speed of light, time would stand still for you.This is more than I can follow, Alice admitted.But Gavin lifted a finger you used your electric alloy to make the Impossible Cube, and it warped the universe around itself.Have you thought of why the alloy does this?Dr.Clef shrugged.I assumed it was to do with the nature of electricity.Electric current cycles back and forth between negative and positive, like a mouse running back and forth between its hole and a piece of cheese.We measure the distance between the two points and call it volts.But, Gavin said again, we dont actually measure the farthest distance.Ive been reading your notes.We measure from a point just below and above the two extremes.To use your metaphor, its as if the mouse paused on the way to the cheese, and then paused again on the way back to its hole, and we actually measure how far the mouse ran from the pauses, not from the cheese or the hole.We do that for convenience because its very hard to measure electricity at its peak and its low.What does this have to do with anything?Alice asked.Gavin turned his eyes on her, and they all but glowed with intensity.To get the distance between the stopping point and the peak, that is, the distance between the pause and the cheese   Oh!Alice interrupted.Youre going to tell me its the square root of two.Well, you multiply by the square root of two, but yes.God in heaven!Dr.Clef dropped his pencil and scrabbled for it on the rocking deck.I knew this fact, my boy, but I never made the connection.The electricity in the alloy cycles between the average and the peak the square root of two and when combined with the Impossible Cubes design, it forces a constant on the universe and changes local time.My paradox generator might do the same thing, Gavin said.If we used your alloy in it and powered it correctly.Dr.Clef clapped his hands with newfound glee and cooperation.It would take a lot of work and careful calculation.Wait a minute, Alice put in.
