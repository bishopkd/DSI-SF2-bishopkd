They were dumbfounded, but they didnt seem to mind her being a gem.I dont think theyre serious troublemakers.But they are Reversionists.Yes, but theyre also devout UCmore focused on piety than politics.Which is a good thing, I reckon, or their little stunt might not have been such a shambles.They went on and on about reviving what they called a culture of faith, but they dont seem to be on the bandwagon of returning to a pre Syndrome evolutionary model.She shrugged.One of them recognized me, but they didnt start anything.The more militant groups would have.I suppose.He gave her an appraising look.Are you still getting a lot of that?Not so much anymore, sir.It flares up from time to time.Including here?She kept her face carefully impassive.You mean at work, sir?Yes, at work.I know not all of your colleagues have been as supportive as they should.Thats a fucking understatement.It took her back, unbidden, to the early days of her and Mikals courtship.At first the long hours she was known to spend in the Squats were put down to an admirable sense of duty, and understandable guilt for a massacre she had been unable to prevent.But it had dawned soon enough on her coworkers that there was far more to her time with him than could be explained away by mere police work, and the whispers had started.They said shed had her head turned, gone native, got kinks most folk could barely imagine and no norm would accommodate.Forgotten she was supposed to be doing the job and instead let the job do her.Lost the plot, along with any sense of propriety or chance of promotion.Some of the worst comments had come from people shed known since her academy days and worked with side by side ever since.She kept it from Mikal as long as she could, and laughed it off when he found out; knowing him well enough already to have no doubt that if he understood how bad it was before he understood how tough she was, he would walk away rather than let her go through it.And even she had not been entirely sure at first that she was tough enough.It cut her to her soul to find herself suddenly so doubted and disdained in a job she loved and was good at.She would go to him then, dazed with the hurt of it, as though to discover once more what could possibly be worth such damage; and in his warmth and wit and courage, the cleverness of his mind and gentleness of his hands and a resilience of character to match her own, find again the answer.She remembered the day she had set herself the task of deciding which she was most prepared to give up, her police career or him; and concluded in half a heartbeat that she could, and would, do neither.Aloud she said, There was a lot of surprise when I married Mikal, but theyve had a couple of years to get used to the idea.Plus hes in the Council now.People have gotten over it, I think.When we have kids, she thought suddenly, it will be back and it will be bad.She pushed the certainty away, tamping it down firmly.Masoud seemed to catch the edge of brisk dismissal in her tone.He echoed it as he said, Good.It goes without saying, you can come to me if things ever get out of hand.He glanced back at the tablet.Somethings come up that needs looking into.Ill be honest, Im not sure at this stage whether its going to warrant a full investigation or not, but its potentially very sensitive and it would benefit from someone with your insight.With the Festival so under control I thought you might like to take a crack at it.He lifted the tablet off the stand and handed it to her.See what you think.She took it and started to scan, then looked back up at him almost immediately.This is from a whistleblower?Any corroboration?Only what was attached.Keep reading.It was a short but typically convoluted claim, and she could feel herself frowning as she mentally unraveled the gist of the allegation.She tapped the links to the screenshots that had been provided as proof.They proved nothing, but she could understand Masouds concern.She returned to the whistleblowers fractured prose, reread a couple of lines, and handed the tablet back.He was watching her face.Well?Id be very happy to look into it, sir.Thank you for thinking of me.He sighed.Sharon, you are such a proper fucking cop you make me want to scream.Theres no review board here.Tell me what you think.I think She considered again what shed read.I think half of what theyre claiming iswasso commonplace it hardly seems worth bothering about at this point.The other half is both very serious and extremely unlikely.My understanding is that security around the central genestock archive is very tight.If there was a breach it should have triggered an urgent, official report.So on the whole the allegation looks dubious.She paused, working through it.Which means that, if it is true, then we have three very serious problems.First, who would want this material and what might they do with it?Second, how were they able to break security to get it?And third, why are we only learning about the theft via a whistleblower?Masoud was nodding.My concerns exactly.Which is why I want someone sensible, who understands the ramifications, to determine whether theres anything to it.It could turn out to be a waste of time.Most whistleblowers are just delusional ex employees with an ax to grind.I know, sir.She paused.But theres something about this, dont you think?In among all the bull, it feels sort of...tangible.I thought so too.I hope Im wrong.His fingers slipped across the tablet.Im transferring it to you for follow up, with a resource allocation.Find out what you can as quickly as you can.And quietly.He looked up.I wont say I dont expect you to mention it to your husband Of course not, sir because I do expect you to.Sharon blinked at him in surprise.Im not nave enough to think otherwise, and I understand that his input might be helpful.Im sure Mikal will be just as aware of the potential fallout from this as you or me.He detached a memtab and handed it to her.Give him my best, wont you?She took the memtab, slipped it onto an intake port on her own tablet.She felt a shiver down her spine as she stood up, as if the tiny, malleable chit of file memory were somehow infectious.Be happy to, sir.She spent an hour closely reading the file, committing the details to memory and cross checking what she could against police and public records.The exercise left her feeling no easier.Genetype hacks had not been uncommon in the old days of intense competition and industrial espionage between gemtechs.Genestock thefts were a different matter.Closely guarded, traded only rarely and at great expense, genestock was the stuff of engineered life itself.A few shadowy tales of internecine robberies and slick substitutions had circulated back in the days before the Declaration; shed heard them as a young officer, filtering into the post shift pub gossip via those whod left the force to work corporate security.But that was before the creation of human beings for profit had been outlawed, and all genestock confiscated by the federated governments.Emancipation had made it both commercially valueless, and virtually inaccessible.So, at any rate, went the theory.She pondered the alleged link between the alleged hacks and the alleged heist, hoping to spot some glaring inconsistency that would allow her to dismiss the whole thing with a clear conscience.The more she picked through it the further away that prospect drifted.She checked again for any clue as to who the whistleblower was, but heor shehad chosen anonymity, and been careful to follow all the protocols that would keep their identity secret even from the police.So, no way of making a judgment based on the credibility of the source.All she knew was that the report had, indeed, originated from behind the firewall of the European Genestock Archive.There were risks to going in hard, not least the blowback if it all proved a false alarm, or, worse yet, a hoax.But if the story was true, too soft an approach might give the perpetrator time to cover their tracks, or to flee.She considered the probabilities there, calculating the least worst option, and fleetingly thought a curse at Masoud.Then she flicked her tablet awake and began the laborious process of requesting a warrant.Binary        Inheritance He is old and she is still young when they realize that something is wrong.They did not think it possible at first.Her birthright had been a blessing, a triumph.Its extent was unknown, its implications unclear, but the potential!The power!She feels like the princess she has always known she is, he like the mage he has always dreamed of being.They keep it a secret while they try to understand how it works and whether it will last, though she must sometimes suppress the impulse to throw it in the faces of spiteful friends and inconstant suitors.Later on she has cause to be grateful for her fathers stern admonitions never to indulge so petty a whim.But that is after he is gone and she is left, as he feared, to make her way in the world alone.Before that they have many years together; more than enough time for him to comprehend, with growing dismay, the consequences of his legacy.He promises to fix it.He will mend what is broken, he will make it right.He has the knowledge and the resources; His best people are on itthough they themselves do not really understand what it is they are tasked with.That does not matter because he does understand, and he is brilliant, and he will pull the disparate pieces together and find a solution.He does not.At the end there are moments when he turns bitter and jealous, and rages at her youth and strength and beauty.Then he weeps, and is full of apology and sorrow.Then the pain takes him and he wishes again for what she has.She would share it if she could, gladly, though the slow years of his aging and the indignity of his death slay in her any desire to relinquish it completely.When his eyes turn dark and he leaves for the last time, she can feel only relief that she will not know the same fate.Binary       9 Rhys sat on the stool, trying to make sense of what Herran was telling him.At the edge of his vision he could just see Callan, lounging on a worn, comfortable looking chairbag, and he found he was having to work hard not to be distracted.Parse streams, said Herran again, patiently.Little bits, lots and lots of little bits.I do, he shrugged.Not easy, not too hard.Okay.You do, lots and lots of work.Not get sick.Ri ight, Rhys said slowly, looking again at the auxiliary screens where Herran was demonstrating his recommendation.So you drop behind the output to the machine code, and drop behind that to the base code, and read the output in binary.In real time?Herran, thats unbelievable.Herran blinked and rocked a little.It appeared to be his default gesture, taking the place of smiles of acknowledgment and shakes of the head and raised eyebrows.His glowing scarlet curls twinkled.Rhys had never before given much thought to the fact that their onstream friendship had been conducted mostly by text instead of vid or voice.He was now, as Aryel had predicted, coming to terms with the challenges of direct communication.Believable, Herran said.I do.But whats the point?Herran just stared at him.Behind them Callan said quietly, Herran?Why do you parse the streams?What for?To see, Herran replied promptly.Sometimes fix.He glanced at Callan.Only if Aryel says okay.Promise.To fix?asked Rhys, feeling as if the thing he had just about grasped was slipping out of his reach again.Fix what?Lets leave the fixing alone for a minute.Callan sat up on the chairbag.The point is that Herran mostly parses the streams, as he puts it, just for fun.He likes to process the same information in different formats.Doesnt really matter what the information is.Have I got that right, Herran?Emphatic nod rocking.Fun.Lots to see.For instance, hes been quite taken with the light sculpture informatics theyve put up for the Festival.Not the displays themselveshe hasnt been to see thembut the datastreams that carry the content.He spends ages hacking the feeds and disaggregating them.Not ages, said Herran.Quick quick.Why bother?said Rhys.Once you get into the base code the information is still the same.Yes, but transmitting it that way requires a far more complicated algorithm than 2D or even 3D fixed geometry, and thats what Herran finds fun.Its not the information itself but the dataform that conveys it that he likes to drill down into.So said Rhys.He had turned on the stool so he could see both of them without squinting.so he processes all this information, but hes mostly not concerned with its meaning?Or context?No, said Callan.Mostly not important, said Herran.Callan chuckled.When BelNatur put me through primary language training they used a similar technique.Theyd scroll the same text in different languages across the screen, three at a time.Theyd be linguistically unrelated, so I couldnt rely on similarities to help me rememberI might get Mandarin and German and Urdu together, but never Italian and Spanish and Portuguese, for example.But the big difference between that and what Herrans suggesting is that for me, and I suspect for you, its all about meaning.I wouldnt have become fluent if all I took in was the vocabulary and sentence structure.It was understanding the content that was important.What was?asked Herran.Understanding the content Rhys began, but Callan shook his head.No, he means what was the content.Different things, Herran.Most often childrens stories at the beginningtwenty one versions of The Princess and the Pea or Jack Russells Dog, all translated so that they were culturally appropriate as well as linguistically accurate.Then newstream reports, classroom lessons, stuff like that.You care?Not really.But it was important anyway.The content had to be coherent, to have meaning, for me to be able to grasp the form that conveys it.I know it sounds strange, but its what my kind of brain needs in order to engage with information.Herran made a sound that was as close to a sigh as Rhys had heard from him.His wide, pale eyes contemplated them both.Rhys has brain like you?Umm.Callan looked down for a moment, smiling.His flaming hair fell forward over his face and he absentmindedly pushed it back.Rhys felt himself swallow.I think Rhyss brain is a lot like mine, Callan said slowly.The smile still played around the corners of his mouth.Though in some ways its like yours too, Herran.He can process a great deal of information very quickly, just like you can.But maybe not in quite the same way.Herrans rocking nod seemed disappointed.Okay.Sorry not help.What?No, you have.Rhys waved at the screens, feeling unaccountably flushed.This...what you do...its amazing.No good for you.Not find genetype either.Not help.No, you have helped, Herran.I thought maybe Id missed something, but if even you cant find our genetypes then I know theyre nowhere to be found.Somewhere.Offstream.Rhys shrugged.Maybe, but if we dont know where and we cant get to them they might as well not exist.So I have to find the answer some other way.Find quick.Before get sick again.For all I know, I may not ever be ill again.All this worry might be for nothing.He kept his eyes fixed on Herran, although he could feel Callans steady gaze from the chairbag.I havent been able to work out exactly what triggers it, or even if there is a trigger.It sort of seems like when my brain has a lot of hard, analytical work to dohacking, solving puzzles, whateverIm less likely to have an...episode, but Im not sure if that isnt just coincidence.And sometimes before one comes on I feel upset, or angry, but I dont know if that causes whatevers happening in my brain, or is caused by it.Not knowing is almost worse than the thing itself.You cant imagine.He doesnt imagine, he thought to himself.It was a sudden, despairing flash of insight, and it dampened the warm thrill that had gusted through him a moment before as effectively as a plunge into an icy mountain stream.Thats as hard for him as what he does would be for anyone else.Thats what they took away.Herran stared back at him, impassive as ever.Like Syndrome?II guess...it took them a long time to work out what was causing the Syndrome...Callan cleared his throat gently.That was not what Herran was asking, and they both knew it.Rhys shot a glance at Callan, knowing he should have explained more last night, wishing he did not have to explain at all.He had nurtured a giddy hope during the long walk home along the river that if he said little and stayed well there would be no need for further detail.But in the hard light of day, in the face of Herrans blunt, guileless questioning, he was forced to conclude that it would neither be possible nor fair to hide the truth of his situation.He drew a deep breath.Yes and no, he said.Most people who had the Syndrome had very mild symptoms to start with, but they were regular, and the damage accumulated over time.What happens to me is...I mean it can be, it isnt always like this...generally its more...He hesitated.More violent, he said finally.It leaves me tired and achyI can feel it when Ive had a seizure, which a lot of the Syndrome patients couldnt.And it comes and goes.Ill get two attacks in a week and then none for three months.I had one a few days agothats why everyone was fussing so much yesterday.But when it goes, its gone.He spread his hands as though to demonstrate.Im completely fine.Are you sure?asked Callan quietly.No.He felt as though the words were being dragged out of him.No, not entirely.Thats part of what Im here to find out.Ari got me fast tracked into the National Neurology Center, and theyve come up with a series of tests to try and work out whats going on.Whether its doing any kind of permanent damage.That doesnt start for another week, we came in early to catch the concert and because Da has stuff to do as part of the Festival.It would really help if the doctors had my genetype to look at, as well as me, but, he sighed and shrugged, and stole another glance at Callan, who was regarding him thoughtfully from the chairbag.It doesnt look like thats going to happen.Bad, observed Herran.Need data.I. ..yes, exactly.He wondered whether it was possible to truly convey his frustration to someone whose emotions had mostly been excised.It would be easier to deal with being ill if I knew what I was ill with, and how bad it might get.Is it going to stabilize, or go away, or get worse?At the moment I dont know, and I hate that.Herran blinked, expressionless, but Callan was sitting up straight, elbows on knees, looking concerned.I hate feeling like its just happening, and I dont understand, and I cant do anything about it.I guess the good thing is at least now I feel like I am doing something.Back home everyones worried and they want to help, but they dont really get it.They keep telling me to rest.He raked aggravated hands through his own short ruby shimmer of hair.Thats the last thing I need.Herran appeared to consider this.Gwen no?Gwen knows...He caught Callan about to explain, and shook his head at him.No, Ive got it, I think.Gwen does know, shes the only other person who really understands what its like for me, but it doesnt happen to her.We dont know why, so part of the worry is that its just hit me first.You find fix, fix for her too.Maybe.If she needs it.She might not.Herran nodded and rocked and blinked at him.Finally he said, Need more work, and turned away to the screens.Rhys watched the lines of code shift and morph for a minute, then turned back to Callan with a sigh.That, he said, just about sums it up.They left Herran morosely examining the coding minutiae of a museum archive, and threaded their way through the warren of the Squats.Callan had suggested they pick up some lunch from one of the street stalls and go sit by the river.Rhyss assumption that Herran would join them had been met by a blank stare from him and an emphatic shake of the head from Callan, who explained as they trotted down a flight of stairs to the ground floor.He doesnt understand why anyone would prefer to sit and look at the water rather than at a tablet screen.He accepts that they do, but he finds it baffling.He glanced sideways at Rhys.Of course in your case you probably wont just be daydreaming like the rest of us.Youll be calculating currents based on eddy patterns, and boat speeds from triangulating the height of the wake.Rhys hunched his shoulders uncomfortably.Its not that bad.I didnt say it was bad at all.I think its a fascinating ability.I think its even more fascinating that using it might actually help keep you healthy.Thats the opposite of the Syndrome.Yeah.But you know, Im not completely certain that it really does help.I mean, I keep my brain as busy as I can and I still get...it.Sometimes.They exited Maryam House into a blaze of summer sunshine.Rhys drew a deep breath.Callan.Thank you for, you know, not doing a runner.The other man turned around at that, looking mystified.II mean, you dont seem to mind.Why would I mind?I dont know.People do.Nobodys supposed to ever have anything wrong with them.He tried to shrug carelessly, felt his shoulders tighten even further.Half the time I feel like some kind of deviant.Callan grinned at him, mischief sparkling in his eyes.Theres deviants and deviants, Rhys.If you like...He took in his companions gloomy face and broke off, shaking his head.Sorry, I shouldnt joke about it.Look, whatever it is you have, its not you.If you dont feel it should be the main thing that people think about when they think about you, well, I agree.I cant pretend its not a big deal right now though.But thats because instead of ignoring the problem, youre trying to solve it.Right?Yes...So thats your focus, and it is completely sensible and necessary.And if I can help I will.They swung onto the main street that meandered through the neighborhood until it met the river.The way I see it, at some point youll have worked it all out, hopefully youll have found a cure, and itll be history.Just one small part of who you are.Thats the plan.So whats there for anyone to mind about that?Rhys found himself smiling back, his spirits lifting.Nothing, I guess.When you put it like that.I just dont hear it put like that very often.They slowed down to peruse the offerings from food stalls and cafs.Callan guided them to the rear of one of the longer queues and stuck his hands in his pockets.He looked pensive, and a little sad.I talk a good game, Rhys, he said quietly, as they edged forward.But I was almost killed a few years ago.I lost people who were close to me.Its taken a whileits still taking a whilefor that not to be the biggest part of my life.Oh.I see.I mean I already knew...but I get it.Thats why Ari was fussing over you.Thats right.Callans eyes were still distant.She doesnt need to, not anymore.I, like you, am mostly fine.But I know that feeling, when youre struggling to get well.You need help but you dont want to feel like the only thing you are is a damagedis someone who needs help.He was watching the pair at the front of the queue, a squat woman with blazing blue hair drawn up into a bun next to an older gillung man with short, deeply bowed legs who leaned against a walker, breathing heavily as he collected and paid for their food.He handed the parcels to the woman and they moved slowly off.Rhys and Callan stepped forward.Callan sighed and shook himself, and turned to Rhys.The smile was back, the melancholy gone.Anyway.So.I get how boring it is when all anyone asks is how you are.Hows your sister?Rhys burst into laughter.Shes fine.Enjoying being the toast of the town?I think shes trying to work out what to do with all the attention.Whatever she expected, this has exceeded it.Did she come to London just to launch her singing career, or is she getting tested as well?She did mostly want to go to the concert, I think, meet Lyriam and all her other onstream musician friends and see what might develop.She is going to come to the hospital with me, provide samples for comparison, although, he shrugged as they moved up almost to the front of the queue, with the gender difference and no genetype for cross matching, Im not sure how useful thatll be.And shes never had any symptoms?Does she use her abilities as much as you?She uses them differently.Shes not much of a hacker, but her sensory awareness is amazing.She processes sound way more than I do.Thats handy in a singer.Yeah.We think it might have been what started her off when we were kids.Making sounds for her brain to play with, like scratching an itch.Callan took a moment to digest this.So by training herself to sing shes actually set up a feedback loop?We think so.And she never gets ill, and you do.It seems to me that what weve got to work out, Rhys, is whatll scratch your itch.He could think of no response to that other than the flush that washed over his cheeks.He hoped, not for the first time, that the darkness of his skin was sufficient camouflage.The flirting had started on the way home last night, so gently he had barely registered it at first.Callans manner seemed calibrated to let him respond in kind, or back away with no hard feelings.But once again he suddenly felt too tongue tied and clumsy to come up with an equally witty reply.So he stayed silent while they got their sandwiches and drinks and strolled down to the quayside that served the Squats in lieu of a town square, trying to think of something to say without seeming a fool.Why three?he blurted finally.Three what?The language feeds you were talking about.The BelNatur training.Oh.Thats as many as I could process at a time without getting a headache.Theyd do different sets of three, though, one after the other.He looked at Rhys curiously.Why?How many do you think you could do?Four or five, I reckon.Maybe six once I got into the rhythm of it.He took in Callans expression, and squirmed with embarrassment.I mean, umm, I dont know if Id really learn them...I dont have your enhanced language centers, not as far as I know anyway...We could try to find out.Callan straddled a bench and set his food down in front of him.Rhys did the same, more slowly, watching the firebright hair tumble forward again as Callan unwrapped the packages.A real flame would have seemed pale out here in the sunshine, but the glowing red gold mane sparkled like a jewel.Callan straightened up, shaking it back and frowning in thought as he licked his fingers.Rhys hastily bit into his own sandwich.Rhys.Pardon the rude question, but what were you and Gwen for?Long pause while he chewed and swallowed the too large bite.Callan started in on his own lunch, watching him.We dont know, Rhys said finally.We were rescued by Da and the others.We were only little and thered been some kind of accident, a fire...Im not sure exactly what happened, but they found us first and got us away.I know there were no records or anything, and its not like they could ask around, not back then and especially not with them being Remnants.If word had gotten out that they were raising gem kids up in the mountains...He shuddered.By the time we were older and things had gotten a bit better out in the world, Da and Ari tried to find out, only the gemtech had gone out of business.Ari thinks we might have been another unregistered experiment.Like her.Rhys nodded.Did you come from the same place?I dont think so.Ari doesnt like to talk about it, but we know she wasnt rescued, she escaped.Shes thirteen or fourteen years older than us, and you know, Rhys shrugged elaborately to indicate himself, ravaged sandwich in one hand, and rolled his eyes at the sky.Not much in common, is there?Callan laughed.Well, not to look at, no.But shes also very smart.Da thinks shes the smartest person we know, or are ever likely to.I dont disagree.But her capabilities are still normal spectrum.Gwen and I are something else.Like Herran.He rubbed at a smear of mayonnaise on the corner of his mouth.Like you.Im mostly normal.My enhancements are very specific.You missed a spot.He leaned forward and brushed it away, so quickly and casually that Rhys thought he might have managed not to blush.And Herrans alteration might be radical, but its also specific.It seems to me that what you and Gwen have covers a broad range.Very high IQ, acute powers of observation and sensory analysis, and if the way she handled the Reversionists is anything to go by, one or two physical enhancements.Am I right?Rhys blinked and squirmed.Well, yeah.Although Da says dont assume some of it isnt just the benefits of growing up in fresh mountain air.Maybe some of it is.But Im guessing not all of it.No, but that part isnt too sophisticated.Speed, strength, coordination.Standard manual labor stuff.He shifted on the bench, considering whether to say more, and then added, Except for the sit sense.The what?Situational awareness.We dont know what else to call it.Its not really cognitive, more like an instinct.Its how I knew Ari was coming up behind us last night.Knowing exactly where everyone is in a room, even if theyre moving around.Are you serious?Rhys bit, chewed.Mm hmm.Do you know whos behind you?Right now?He swallowed.The sandwich was very good, and almost gone.He spoke softly.The Recombin woman and the man with the rickety legs who were two places in front of us in the queue.They were sitting on a bench in the shade.Theyve finished eating now, and theyve just come up to the rail.A couple of norms who were there before them are walking away.Callan was staring.His eyes flicked up, looking over Rhyss shoulder at the couple leaning against the safety rail, then tracked right to follow the receding backs of the norms.They came back to Rhyss face.Wow.He raised his eyebrows inquiringly.Anything else?Not really.You already know about the night vision.Oh yes.Very handy, that.He crumpled up the empty packaging and stretched, leaned lazily back on propped arms.Well, that is one hell of a suite of abilities, way more than Ive ever heard of anyone else having.You two must have cost a fortune.I dont know what to make of it.Neither do we.They went quiet.Callan looked sideways, out over the river, relaxing into an elegant, indolent profile.It took Rhys a moment to follow his gaze out to the water.He could feel himself doing what he had been teased about earlier, perhaps a little more consciously than usual as his brain seized on the distraction: calculating distances and depth and angles of refraction.He knew that if he had to he could plunge into the river and swim across it at a speed that could probably only be bettered by a gillung.He felt suddenly depressed.Does it matter?What?What we were for.Not to me.It came out absently, and he could see Callan catch himself.Not to any of us.But if we knew, we might have a better idea of whats going on with you and how to help.Did the gemtech specialize in anything?Not that we know of, but there was something very weird about the lab where they found us.Da says it was a few miles out of some village thats not even there anymore.No one hardly seemed to know it existed until it burned down.Not even him?No, it was well outside their normal range.Too close to civilization, especially back then.They were passing through for some reason and heard the explosion.Pure luck.Gwennie and I had gotten out into the woods somehow, and it was clear they werent going to be able to help anybody else, so they grabbed us and ran.Whoever showed up after must have believed everyone had been killed, but Da kept an eye on the streams for a while just in case.Thats how he found out it was owned by KAG Laboratories.As far as we can tell KAG mostly did core R&D at that point, and sold off the tech.He shook his head again, frustrated.Gwen and I searched, believe me, and so did Ari.Theres almost no information on the newstream archives, no corporate datastreams we could find, no one else weve ever heard of who came out of it.KAG didnt have any gestation or crche facilities, at least none that were registered.They were an old gemtech, theyd apparently been contracting for a long time, so it doesnt really fit.Either they were starting to expand againweve wondered if we might have been part of the first commercial batchor they were running this place as a black lab, outside their normal operations and under the radar of the authorities.We dont know, because the whole thing just disappeared.Callan frowned.That doesnt make sense.Whether it was sold or wound down or went bankrupt, there must be records.I know.But we couldnt find any.When I realized that my genetype might be really important, I hacked every datastream I could.Drew a blank, so I asked Herran if he had any ideas, and he searched.And, well, you heard.So what are you going to do now?Rely on the genmed team here, I guess.Ari says I have to stop believing its all up to me.She thinks the more stressed I am the more likely I am to get ill.She might be right about that part.He popped the last morsel in his mouth, and wiped his fingers.Its just that the more engineered a genome is, the harder it is to understand whats going on purely from sequencing it.You need the modification index, and the epigenetic directory, to see where all the molecular switches are and how they interact with each other.And for that you need the genetype.Wow.Callan looked impressed.You sound like an expert.I know a lot about genetic medicine now.Its fascinating stuff.He hesitated a moment then said, Im thinking of studying it.What, properly?Formally?Yes.I already have all the qualifications Id need, but I havent said it to too many people yet.I know gems arent supposed to want to do anything sort of...gemtech y.  I guess for a lot of people it feels distasteful, Callan acknowledged.But medicine isnt the same as modification, and anyway, we need to get over it.Otherwise all the expertise will stay with norms.So you think its a good idea?Callan grinned at him.I think its a great idea.I would love to know that if I ever needed a genmed consultation youd be the doctor on call.Rhys grinned back, bathed in warmth and a surge of unexpected happiness.His usual sense of being isolated, even in the midst of a crowd, even sometimes from Gwen, was burning away like mist off the river.He felt well here, sitting in the sunshine in the middle of this huge, complicated, fascinating city, where every smell and sound and glance, every vibration under his feet or glimmer overhead was new enough to give the restless, questing part of his mind something to work on.And the other part of him, the part that cared nothing for the calculus of his environment, felt the pull of the man opposite, felt the flutter in his chest and the tug at the base of his belly; and he thought how easy it would be to fall, and in that moment he could think of no reasons not to.Binary       10 Eli watched the two young men out on the quay, facing each other over their picnic like a pair of beautiful, capricious demigods from some ancient play.Against the silver gray backdrop of the river their red heads sparkled, one bright, one dark.Gulls dipped and soared over the water behind them, shrieking as they veered ever closer.Rhys tossed a crust to one, intersecting its vector so precisely that the bird snatched it out of the air with barely a twitch of its wings, and said something that made Callan throw his head back and laugh.Eli blinked.To see Callan so relaxed, especially out in the open, was rare indeed.He was tempted to join them, at least go over and say hello, but he decided against it.Though they were surrounded by others strolling or sitting in the midday sunshine, there was something intimate about the picture they made; an aura of privacy about the way they met each others eyes and laughed at each others jokes, and leaned in just a tiny bit closer than necessary to speak.Eli, more attuned than most to the subtleties of human behavior, smiled and left them to it.He had other business in any case, and turned his back on the quay as he trudged up main street to a large and unprepossessing building that squatted at the back of a small plaza, like a lumpen brown package set down to one side but never unwrapped and put properly away.The old rec center, long since remade into the town hall and cultural hub of the Squats community, would have won no architectural prizes in any era.Eli went through to the main foyer, passing Lyriam along the way.The musician was being interviewed, backed artistically against a window with a view of the sun drenched street behind.Of course it was the middle of winter then, before we got here we were always so cold, Eli heard him say.He glanced over, catching the younger mans eye, seeing the spark of shared memory as for a moment they both relived that refugees advent.Bethany, standing off to the side, favored him with a distracted simper.He smiled back, thinking that Aryel had as usual been right, and passed swiftly through.Mikal was rarely to be found manning the reception desk these days; probably, Eli reflected, never would again.He waved a greeting and mouthed a question to the young woman with shimmering teal green hair whose hands flickered across a tablet bank as she murmured into her earset.She waved back, nodding and pointing in the direction he was headed.The giant gem was in his office, multitasking with earset and tablet, and he beckoned Eli forward as he hesitated in the doorway.He stepped inside and dropped into a chair.Yes, I understand that, Sharon took their statements.Mikal spoke into the earset, rolling his eyes wearily.No, nothing to do with you, we hadnt thought so...we know you know any religious association is incidental...Lyriam has no intention of being bullied, Im sure you understand his position...Quite.A longish pause.Mikals narrow, mobile face twitched with amusement.A great song...yes, there is that...very talented.I couldnt say.Always good to talk to you.His fingers halted in the act of reaching to flick the earset back to standby.He stared vacantly at Eli, blinking that patient, double lidded blink.Eli grinned in anticipation.The impact of faith is certainly appreciable, if not always appreciated, Mikal said smoothly, into what must have been a pause for breath on the other end.One could hardly overstate it.He smiled gently, waited a polite half second in case there was a comeback, and concluded, Ill keep you posted, of course, if theres anything further at our end.Youll do the same?Thanks so much.Right.All the best, and he flicked off and pulled the earset away, tossing it onto the desk with a sigh and shaking his head at Elis chuckles.You shouldnt encourage me, you know.As if you needed it.Who was that, Tobias?Nope, Bishop Maloney herself.Our friends at the UC are quite rattled.He grinned.Also enchanted with young Gwen.Maireads nurturing a hope that she might actually be a believer.I was simply declining to comment.So what did she have to say about it?The idiots at the concert?Not much.Sharon found out theyre from a congregation near Oxford, and the good bishop recalled hearing some Reversionist rumblings from out that way.The usual complaints about cultural shifts and the death of evangelism.No hint of an anti gem stance, so they let it slip under the radar.Mairead Maloney probably agrees with them.No doubt, but she understands how dangerous any kind of aggressive proselytizing could be.Its a very delicate balance for them, given that most of the godgangs were found to have had links with the UCtheyre still trying to live down the association.But on the other hand, I think shes also elated that Gwens intervention means thousands of people ended up hearing a hymn for the first time.He sighed and stretched.The truth is she gave it far more exposure than it would have gotten otherwise.The only part of the show thats had more hits is the elegy.Not many more.The streams are going crazy for her.Aryel Morningstars little sister, with a voice to match those wings!Eli shook his head ruefully.If youre trying to revive religion for the modern age that connection doesnt hurt.I dont imagine Gwen realizes quite what shes stepped into.Shell work it out soon enough.Lyriam will help.And Aryel knows how to navigate that channel better than anyone.He took in the look on Elis face.It still really bothers you, doesnt it?Even though you were part of it.Maybe because Im part of it.Its just...the reaction to Aryel is deeply illogical.If you had told me the day before Newhope Tower that people en masse would have such an atavistic response to her, regardless of their backgrounds or beliefs, regardless of history, I would have laughed at you.But when it happened it felt...natural.Obvious.Inevitable.It sort of bothers me that it doesnt bother me, if that makes any sense.She tried very hard to avoid it.I know she did.Shes been completely honorable.And youd think that her not taking advantage of the situation in all the ways that she could would minimize the impact, that by now she would be just another gem.But she isnt.And its curious that all the new sects and splinter groups include so few anti Aryel factions.Almost everyone manages to mold their philosophy into a shape that treats her with enormous respect.Even the Reversionists.Especially the Reversionists.Im glad about that, but I dont understand it.She should be a polarizing figure.It is a mystery, said Mikal solemnly, but well take them over the godgangs or the gemtechs, thank you very much.Personally Im quite fond of the religious Reversionists, even though they are less than fond of Sharon and me.They dont want gem norm crossovers, but they do want peace and love between all peoples; they think artificial evolution is morally wrong, but they adore Aryel.Its so nice to have incompetent adversaries for a change.Eli laughed.Speaking of the gemtechs, any word from Aryel?Not yet.Shell message us both, I imagine.I have heard from Zavcka Klist, though.What?Oh, not about their meeting.Though given the timing, I think it has everything to do with it.He picked up the tablet and flicked it awake in one movement, then contemplated whatever was on the screen with the mild distaste of a man peering at something suspect on the sole of his shoe.Dear Councillor Varsi, he read aloud.Just a quick note following our conversation yesterday evening.In addition to the regulatory oversight we discussed, the BelNatur ethics and welfare team would welcome your input on appropriate standards and safeguards.I wonder if you would be available to meet with them in the first instance, perhaps to agree an ongoing advisory role?Your perspective, in terms of your public service responsibilities as well as your own personal history, would be invaluable.I hope to hear from you at your convenience.Sincerely, Zavcka.He dropped the tablet back onto its stand, and brushed imaginary dirt off his fingers.Sent half an hour before she was due to meet with Aryel.Eli shook his head in bemusement.All he could think of to say was, Thats how she signed off?Zavcka?Were on a first name basis, apparently.Best friends, I told you.What are you going to do?Go talk to them, of course.I can hardly refuse, can I?But I want to hear from Aryel before I reply.Gwens tablet pinged softly, and she raised it in front of her face without bothering to sit up.Another clutch of messages from people shed never heard of; praise and propositions mostly, a couple of frankly bizarre references to scripture, almost all also requests for an interview.Or an exclusive snippet of song.A few more UC congregations inviting her to Sunday worship, wondering if she could be persuaded to perform for them.She sighed, flicked the tablet back to standby, and dropped it onto the bed beside her.Eli might have been surprised to discover that she was fully aware of the ripples and ramifications of what shed done.Even as shed rolled to her feet on that grassy bank in the park, in the first few strides down the slope, she had been calculating probabilities and evaluating options; aware of the placement of every vidcam, sight lines from the stage, the likelihood of the speaker hack working and how she would adjust her response if it didnt.Shed judged the tuneless fools to have no weapons nor to offer any threat of violence, and been right.Shed felt the mood of the crowd around her, euphoria beginning to give way to dismay, and had known exactly what would capture their collective imagination.But it depended as much on the actions of others, and shed had a presentiment of folly even as she took the earset that would transmit her own voice.Surely her intention would not be clear to Lyriam; he would not, could not, possibly understand what she planned to do.Much less be willing to facilitate it.She replayed the moment, and felt again the little leap of excitement shed felt when she realized he did and he would.Now lying prone in the dim bedroom, alone in Aryels echoing apartment, she was putting her operational calculus to work once more: evaluating the fallout, projecting the next array of possible outcomes.So far things could hardly, she judged, have gone any better.The furor was very much on the high end of her initial assessment, but almost universally positive.Lyriams laughing approval, murmured close to her ear, called out over a sea of heads and reinforced in interviews and posts to public streams, had seen to that.She had caught Bethanys glower and knew that the blond norm did not feel the same way.She considered briefly whether that should bother her more than it did, and concluded that, right or wrong, she found it impossible to feel any sympathy for Bethany; close though they were in age, similar though some of their experiences must have beena norm among gems, a gem among norms.But Bethanys life in the Squats with Lyriam had not, Gwen thought, been the only one she had ever known, nor perhaps as stable, simple, and down to earth as her and Rhyss upbringing with Da and the rest of their Remnant tribe.Lyriam had listened to their tales from the country, of music made and stories sung around the fire on winter nights, with something that looked like longing.Bethany, visibly bored, had wandered off.Gwen silently admitted that, in the few moments they had spent together, she had been equally bored by the girl.She seemed to lack the spark of adventure, the anarchic sense of fun, that had enabled Lyriam to appreciate Gwens intervention.It was her lossand Lyriams relationship to manage.All was not well there, that much was evident.She would follow his lead, and if he did not feel constrained by his girlfriends disapproval, then neither would Gwen.The only question now was how best to take advantage of the moment she had not so accidentally created.She had set a course at the party, followed it up with carefully worded posts and private messages throughout the morning.Now she was waiting to see if the vague plans and half made promises of the night were real.The inaction chafed at her.The tablet chimed again.This time, as she read the message, she could feel herself beginning to smile.Hed said he had to be interviewed for a documentary this morning: something Bethany had arranged, a puff piece on her life in the Squats.He was done with it now, had been able, she read, to escape.And hed been thinking overnight about songs to work on together.Was she interested?When would she be free?Her fingers slipped over the surface of the tablet even as she swung her legs down to the floor.Right now, she wrote.Id love to.Lets get started.She was three strides from Aryels front door a few minutes later when it slid open and Reginald stepped into the apartment.He was frowning as he peered at the tablet in his hand, and there was a testy glint in his sharp eyes as he looked up at her from it.You off somewhere?Im going to meet Lyriam and the band.Were you up in the garden all this time, Da?I thought youd gone over to the airwalk already.Thats where I should be.Things to do, people to meet.He snorted and waved the tablet at her.Instead Ive been stuck on this thing.What are you going to do about this mess?What mess?Your mess.I keep getting messages from people about your stunt last night.I dont even know who the hell half of them are.Why are they messaging you?Blessed if I know.They seem to have the crazy idea that I might have some special insight.Being your father and all.He scowled at the tablet again, and thumbed it off.Ive got everyone from priests to politicians asking me about your religious education.My what?Exactly.Most of them also imagine I must secretly agree with whatever point those idiots were trying to make.They seem to think being Remnant automatically means being Reversionist.As if.He snorted again.Gwen sighed.Thats a fairly logical conclusion for most people to jump to, Da.And a fairly harmless one, most of the time.Except now theyre not just assuming, theyre asking.Which means I have to say no, I think theyre a bunch of misguided, shortsighted, ancestor worshipping nitwits.Gwen raised an eyebrow.You havent actually said that, have you?Close enough.She chortled.Well, that should get you lots of attention.You can use it to talk up the airwalk tech.Thank you for the silver lining.Is Rhys still down at Herrans place?No, he messaged to say he and Callan were going out for a bit.Hes all right, hes feeling good today.Lets hope he stays that way.Especially while youre up to whatever it is youre up to.What makes you think Im up to anything?Gwen, love, in the twenty years since you came into my care, youve never not been up to something.The eyes were still piercing, but, along with the voice, had turned gentle.Just remember that you are not the most important thing at the moment.Rhys is.Rhys will always be my priority, she said softly, modulating her own voice to match his, ensuring there was no trace of edge in it.But hes going to be fine, Im sure he is.He doesnt need me to be with him all the time and he hates it when we hover, you know that.Hes healthy right now, and he doesnt start at the hospital for almost a week.Theres a lot I can be doing in the meantime.You think sitting around here, staring at the walls while you and Rhys and Ari are all out on your various missions is fun for me?I have things I want to achieve too, Da.She stepped toward the door.Ill be there when he needs me.Whenever he needs me.Fair enough.He nodded acceptance, and then waved the tablet again.What are you planning to do about the clamoring faithful?Im planning to ignore them.Unless I can think of a better reason not to.Binary        Education She often hears them arguing.It is almost always about her, but they do not trouble themselves overmuch to ensure that she is out of earshot.It will be some while yet before they can bring themselves to believe just how much she comprehends.In the meantime, she is learning the wisdom of guile.She sits on the floor in a far corner, the battered tablet in her hands, and is careful to angle herself so she can see if anyone approaches.She completed the standard curriculum some time ago, working out with little trouble how to access the levels supposedly beyond her capability.Now she is in the encyclopedia function she is not supposed to know about, flipping from one entry to another, keeping up with the conversation....Im telling you, I think her IQ might even be normal for her age.She hits the average percentiles in every test we give her, shes on track with the modules...look at her, she spends every waking moment with that tablet.They all glance in her direction.She pretends not to notice, and waits.She already knows what IQ means.How bright can she be, if it takes her that long?We dont know that it does.She doesnt have any other toys or learning tools, or playmates for that matter.She might just be going over the lessons out of boredom.Dr.Owens eyes still rest on her, and his voice is thoughtful.He is the one most interested in her cognitive developmentshe learned what that was, oh ages and ages agoand he has never forgotten the lesson of that first lisping conversation.She works particularly hard to ensure he thinks just as much of her as he should, and no more.I say we should open up the modules, he goes on.Let her take a look at the next two or three, see what she goes for.Maybe even give her access to some general reading material.Assess her curiosity.Oh good.That would save so much trouble.Another white coat shrugs, waves dismissively.She is Dr.Panborn, and she is the only one Dr.Owen ever needs to get permission from.Things have been changing since she appeared, around the same time that the last of the other children was covered up and wheeled away.I dont really see the point of that, but go ahead if you want.Satisfy your own curiosity.It does not, however, address the main question.A pause, while they all look at each other.One of the other white coats, another recent arrival, says, Can we be absolutely certain the batch wasnt just contaminated?That would be the simplest explanation...The lab supervisor, a man named Clark, sighs and rolls his eyes.Weve been asking that question for seven years now, and I dont think were going to get any better answers than weve got.What I want to know is, contaminated with what, exactly?A few extra alleles of eagle?She already knows what an allele is.Eagle is new.She gets the spelling wrong on the first try, tries again, and the information rolls up on the screen.She blinks in puzzlement at the picture, some strange brown black creature perched on the high bare branch of a tree, and then bites back a gasp as it launches itself into the air.She watches, mesmerized by the few seconds of vid, and feels the awkward, naked limbs that flop uselessly against her back twitch and stretch and try to imitate the movement.She thought she had already found everything the tablet contained on wings.There is a familiar sense of wonder, and anger, at how much remains to be discovered.Obviously why it happened isnt unimportant, Dr.Panborn says, in a tone that suggests maybe it is.But its high time for a shift in emphasis.Weve been working with the Phoenix genestock in other batches, with and without interspecies splicing, and thereve been no other aberrations...There have, says Dr.Owen.They havent been significant, and they havent had the upside.Whatever happened in this specimen didnt just incorporate a single radical anatomic transformation, its carried the mutation throughout the other organs.Systemic complementarity.Shes got feathers getting ready to grow, for Gods sake, shes got a metabolism that looks like it might actually be efficient enough to power flight.The issue isnt her specific dysmorphism, its the potential.Reverse engineering the wings isnt so important, I mean what could you ever do with them?But if we can understand how her body has adapted all its systems to support that primary mutation, if we can replicate the totality of that shift...thats a gold mine.They nod and murmur and glance over at her again, while she taps and swipes at the tablet screen and affects a reassuring placidity.
