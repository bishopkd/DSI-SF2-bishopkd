She mightve died...but shes not dead, he told me.Leastways, I dont think so.He paused for a moment, savoring the looks on our faces.Okay.So what?I asked impatiently.Again he held up the syringe.It was developed for space travel.Very loosely based on a drug called tetrodotoxinan emergency alternative to freezing, if you were really low on juice or something.With the right equipment, it can be surprisingly accurate.On a six month journey, they reckon they can get you to wake up within a few hours of your allotted time.Thats what he gave her?It shuts everything down: thered be no life signs to monitor.I collected my thoughts.I mean, apart from the relief of having confirmed what I knew all alongthat Lena was aliveI was slightly disappointed: it was another piece of the puzzle, but not, as far as I could see, one that advanced us in any way.So shes alive?Gordie said.If they went to those lengths, Jimmy said, yeah, Id say so.Gordie gave a loud sigh, almost a cry of relief, and I realized that he, like the others, had had his doubts.course she is!I told him, touched by just how pleased he was.Have you seen the graffiti?Big Guy!Jimmy protested, plainly thinking we hadnt spent anywhere enough time appreciating his discovery, but I was already on my way up the steps.I want his opinion.Despite still being deadly enemies, I took both Gordie and Hanna, the pair of them getting these expressions on their faces when they first saw the graffiti, the new additions, like they were more impressed than they thought they were gonna be.Part of the reason I took Hanna was cuz of that individual way she has of looking at thingsbut she applied herself in a much more practical fashion, stepping up to the graffiti and going along the letters one by one.Ive seen this s before, she said.What dyou mean?People often have a signature letter.With this person its the s.  I seen it over on the Island.In the Camp.You sure?Yes!Bullshit, Gordie sneered.Its everywhere.Where?I asked.All over!Its real common.Not like that, Hanna said, indicating the bottom curve.Gordie gave this highly contemptuous snort, as if he would laugh at her but she wasnt worth the effort.I paused, not knowing who to believe, and eventually, without another word, Hanna just turned and walked back to the church as if shed given her verdict and now it was up to me to decide who to believe.Gordie and me followed on behind.I glanced back at the graffiti a couple of times, still a long way from understanding.But if I really wanted to find out who was doing this, and what it was all about, there was only one way.I hid myself behind a bush not far from the churchyard gate so I could be across the street in a matter of moments.The fire, what little remained of it, was giving off just about enough light for me to see by.It was more or less the same wherever I went now: the fires had wreaked pretty much all the damage they could, and though there were still new ones erupting, I felt the end might well be in sightnot that that was any cause for celebration or optimism; more just the understanding that there was nothing left to burn.A little later Delilah came out to see me.She was seeking me out more and more; as if she felt there was an affinity, that we were both in the same boat, grieving for those we dearly loved and missed.Youll find her, Clancy.Dont worry, she told me, talking rather louder than I cared for, nor making any attempt to hide herself.I know, I replied, keeping my voice to not much more than a whisper, hoping shed take the hint.Thing is, she continued, not dropping her volume one bit, we so rarely savor life...spend a whole lifetime mourning its loss...I keep thinking about all those times I scolded Arturo, or was too tired for him Delilah, I interrupted, Im hoping to surprise someone here.For a moment she did go quiet, but I knew it wouldnt last for long.How often do we take the time to think, Today Im happy, I appreciate this for what it is?Instead we just cry when its gone.You got that right, I agreed.When you get her back, Clancy...savor the moments.Oh, I will, I told her, absurdly grateful for the when as opposed to if.She started to cough, a real full blooded hack that echoed all around the churchyard, the smoke getting to her single lung again.Delilah!If anyone does come, youre gonna frighten them off.Okay, okay, she said, punctuating almost every word with breathless splutters, I know when Im not wanted.Go and savor your man, I joked.Now theres someone who does appreciate every minutenot with me, but with his goddamn junk.One day hes gonna invent himself a beautiful robot lady and Ill be shown the door.He wouldnt dare.A real male fantasy; programmed never to complain, stand up for herself or need foreplay.Delilah!I protested.Way too much information for my liking!Oh, Im sure youre different, Clancy.No way was I going to add to that discussion, and finally taking the hint, she shuffled off, sniggering away to herself, leaving me slightly puzzled as to what the real subject of the conversation had been.I sighed and settled back down.Id brought my sleeping bag up, ready to stay there all night if had tobut as it turned out, it wasnt necessary.Maybe an hour or so later the occasional individual or group were still passing but by and large, most people had found somewhere safe and battened down hatches for the night.I was just starting to think I should do the same, that our graffiti artist wasnt coming, when suddenly a figure slipped out of the smoke on the opposite side of the street.What with my old eyes and the poor visibility I couldnt make out if they were male or female.They were quite small, and it occurred to me that maybe it was a kid, which wouldve explained why they didnt want any contact with an old person.They were dressed in a slightly bizarre fashion that gave them a kinda shapeless look.One thing was certain; I could forget any wild notions Hanna had put in my head.It wasnt Lena.Whoever it was paused at the graffitid wall, staring over at the churchyard so intently that for a moment I thought Id been spotted.I ducked down.I mean, Id only caught a glimpse and it wasnt the best of circumstances, but you know, I didnt recognize them at all.I couldve made my way over then and there and grabbed them, demanded to know what the hell heor shethought they were playing at, but I thought Id bide my time til they started work.That way not only would I get to see what they were gonna write, but theyd be so preoccupied itd be much easier to sneak up on them.Man or woman, boy or girl: whoever it was slid a can out of their pocket and started spraying.I gotta admit, there was a kind of tension to it, watching those words slowly appear, letter by letter...ITS A  Its a what?ITS A FOGGY  What the hell?ITS A FOGGY NIGHT  It was only when they stuffed the can back into their pocket and checked up and down the street that I realized theyd finished.That was it?That was all they were going to say?What did that even mean?Its a foggy nightit wasnt even correct: it was smoke, not fog.I stood up, about to make my way over and exercise a little frustration, when I stopped dead...Foggy night!Jesus, no!It didnt mean a great deal here on the Mainland, but it sure as hell had out on the Island: it meant we were about to be attacked!And at that precise moment, almost as if someoned been waiting for that thought to trigger it, a familiar yet terrifying noise echoed out across the City, instantly turning the hairs on the back of my neck to icicles.Maybe cuz it was quite closepossibly in the SquareI could clearly hear each separate component: the shattering rhythm of the beaters, pounding everything they came across, yelling into the night; the hullabaloo of the heavy machinery, the thrumming Dragonflies.There was an army gathering, hell bent on genocide, on eradicating all those who represented an inconvenience to them, and dont ask me how, but I just knew they were coming our way.I turned back to see my graffiti artist hurrying off in the opposite direction.Hey!I hollered, Hey!but their only reaction was to start running.I chased after them, calling out again, but it soon became apparent that they were way too fast for meand more importantly, that I needed to get back to the churchyard.Hey!I shouted one last time as I stumbled to a breathless halt, and then, cuz I could think of no other way to do it, I cried, Thank you!But theyd already gone, lost somewhere in the loudly erupting night.I stood there for a moment, trying to get my breath back as people started emerging out of the smoke, panicking as they ran around me.In the distance I could just about make out the glow of an advancing wall of discordant light.They were going to run through and over everything again, mopping up those theyd missed the other night, and this time I was sure the crypt wouldnt survive.I started to run back, a swimmer against the tide, ignoring the many people who tried to tell me I was going the wrong way.Panic was spurring me on, urging me ever faster, the realization that with half the buildings already flattened, the Specials would arrive a lot quicker this time.I found the others already outside, gaping in the direction of the advancing army, Delilah looking like she was about to start screamingand I didnt exactly blame her either.Big Guy!What we gonna do?Jimmy begged.Grab what you can, I told them, directing everyone toward the crypt.Quick!We gotta go.Where?Delilah asked.Not far, I told her, in my haste almost pushing her down the steps.We took everything we could, scrambling around in the dark, so aware the noise was getting closer by the second, fumbling our way back up.All but one of us, that was: Jimmy was still down below.Jimmy!I screamed down the steps as the Dragonflies emerged out of the smoke, breaking ranks and flying forward like the pilots couldnt wait to start shooting.Theyre here!Okay, okay, he shouted.Were going!I told him.Finally he came tottering up, carrying, not the last of the food or essential supplies but as much of his damned techno junk as he could manage.Come on!I yelled as the Dragonflies started to sweep their searchlights from side to side.I showed them the way through the jungle of razor sharp blackthorns, stopping to move the branches Id used to disguise the path.Id always known the day would come when wed need that place, and finally it had.Jimmy was so determined not to drop any of his stuff he got his arms badly scratched, but not even the growing noise, the approaching lights of the Dragonflies, could persuade him to discard anything.Where we going, Big Guy?he kept repeating, though he didnt look like he was in any fit state to register an answer.Whats the plan?Keep moving, I told him.Finally, we made it to that sheltered area Id found right up against the wall, protected by ramparts of natures spikes and spears.I couldnt see even Infinity beaters being game enough to try to get through there.course, they mightve sent the dozers overbut if they couldnt get in, I was praying theyd assume that no one would get flushed out.They were right behind us.Another few seconds and we wouldve been seen.There was that same crashing tsunami of noise: walls being toppled, a cacophony of wayward crying and screaming, the occasional shot, and it frightened the hell out of usitd frighten the hell out of anyone.They flattened almost everything in their path, anything that might possibly have offered refuge or provided a hiding place, and just as Id feared, the floor of the church gave way, one of their machines almost disappearing into the hole.Everything stopped, the Specials paused in their relentless rhythm, and several people came to peer down.An earnest conversation took place with the Dragonflies hovering overhead, illuminating the scene.Eventually someone picked their way down into the crypt, disappearing for a moment, and it went through my head that maybe theyd known we were therethat they were looking for us.The guy climbed back out and I couldnt tell whether hed guessed anyone had been living down there.Whatever, they bulldozed the remains of the church into the hole so no one could ever seek that particular sanctuary again.I turned to the others and saw the fear frozen on their faces.I put my arm around Hanna.When they were finally satisfied no one would ever make that place a home again, the order was given, the noise resumed, and everyone slowly moved forward.I heard Delilah give this little moan.I thought at first it was relief that wed escaped again, but then I saw theyd run over Arturos memorial stone, the one that shed so lovingly scratched out, smashing it along with all the others.I waited till I heard them clear the churchyard, then began to tentatively pick my way back out through the blackthorn bushes.Seeing the last of the Specials disappearing into the smoke, try as I might, it was impossible not to think of the last time theyd paid us a visit; when wed lost our little Arturo.Shit, Jimmy muttered, appearing at my side, looking at the further devastation around us.They wanted to warn us, I told him.Who?he asked, mystified.I pointed toward the other side of the street, but Infinity had done an equally thorough demolition job over there and very little was left standing.Whoevers been leaving the messages.I told him the whole story, but I guess he didnt think it mattered much in that moment.With no more than a grunt he returned into the bushes: our new home.It mustve been another thirty or forty minutes before we finally heard the noise wed all been dreading.Not one of us spoke as volley after volley rang out.Hanna put her hands over her ears to try and shut it out, rocking back and forth, just the way I used to sometimes when the kids were raiding us out on the Island.But again it was Delilah who took it the hardest, sitting there with a thousand ghosts playing on her face, every shot a reminder of the one that had killed Arturo.Sick, was all Jimmy could say, as he sat there cleaning his scratches.Sick society.After wed all positioned and repositioned our sleeping bags several times over, trying to work out the driest and warmest places, we bedded down for the night.As it turned out, it was that bit more comfortable than the cryptsofter underfoot, without that invasive cold and dampand Gordie wanted to know why we hadnt moved over there sooner.Despite what wed been through, everyone fell asleep remarkably quickly.Everyone, that was, of course, cept me.Once again I was left just lying there, listening to their various nocturnal noises: Jimmys wheezy creaking, Delilahs heavy sawing, Gordies precociously loud snore and, if you could pick it out, the absolute silence that surrounded Hanna.I felt a little sad that wed moved.It mightve been forced on us, but if Lena came back shed find everything wasnt exactly the way shed left it, and that made it feel like she was just that bit further away.I also couldnt stop thinking about our phantom artist.Who the hell was it?For sure I didnt recognize themand yet whoever it was knew something about Lenaabout both of us.And the way theyd tried to warn us, they were apparently on our side.But did they know where Lena was?Did they have any real information?I sighed and turned over, for a moment enjoying the slight disturbance of the outside wafting over my face.Whoever this graffiti artist was, they represented my only hope.Somehow I had to find them.People are never one hundred percent consistent one hundred percent of the timeafter all, its a boring person who can always be predicted.Jimmy might say I respond purely to instinct, that Im some kind of animal who never thinks things through, but I have my moments, even if they aint that frequent.The following day I walked slowly up to the Square, then turned around and walked back down again, checking what little remained after our second visit from Infinity.The answer to that question was...not a helluva lot.There was barely a building that hadnt been rendered to rubble by the Specials, smashed to bits and obliterated, completing the job the fires had begun.In fact, it reminded me of the Old City out on the Island, the way it had been left after the riots.Just like over there, there was still the odd finger of a building left standinga doorway that refused to topple, an occasional stubborn slither of walland as I made my way back to the churchyard I made a mental note of each and every one.The way I saw it, if this mystery person was still of a mind to communicate with me, the chances were that with the walls across the street gone, theyd look for the nearest alternative stretch of brickwork between here and the Squarea place they knew I regularly passed.Which didnt leave too many possibilities, since most of what was left wasnt big enough to write a word on, let alone a message.However, I did find one section, five or six yards long, partly slumped over like some old sleeping dinosaur, and only a few minutes along the street.That night I stole up there and hid amongst the rubble, concealed by the wall itself, on the other side to the street but ready to jump out at a moments notice.For hour after hour I sat there, ignoring the bricks biting into my squidgy old ass, repeatedly telling myself that no one was gonna come, that theyd either been frightened off or fallen victim to Infinity, til finally, with the first faint smudge of smoky light fanning out from the East, I got to my feet slowly and stiffly and walked back to the churchyard, not only pained and aching but fearing that whatever opportunity that artist had presented had now gone.I spent the rest of the day trying to improve our little shelter as much as I could: weaving black garbage bags into the overhanging branches so that at least a part of our lair would stay dry in the event of bad weather, digging out a pit for a fire so we could attempt a little cooking Jimmy got his screen back performing its intended function and everyone stopped to see what had been going on.However, it didnt take us long to get fed up with all those endless clips of crazed looters, degenerates and anarchists, and up against them, the gallant Infinity Specials; there to watch over us, to protect and maintain the status quo, prepared to give their very lives in our defense.According to the reporter, seven Specials had been brutally slain while performing their heroic dutythough much to my relief they didnt go into detail.They also went on to show a gang of executed looters, laid out at the scene of their crime, though I wouldnt have minded betting they were Clean up victims; that this was just more Infinity propaganda.At the end of a long and predictable sequence about the battle between good and evil being played out on our streets, they went on to show us the villains gallery.Jimmy was still Number One, but according to the report, they anticipated his eradication any day now.I glanced across to see how the little guy was taking the news, but his only reaction was to repeatedly shake his head.He just didnt get how theyd managed to read his namewhat they used, how they went about itand Ill tell you, if he couldnt work it out, there wasnt much point in me even trying.I didnt plan on going to watch for the graffiti artist that eveningI mean, they probably wouldnt risk it again, I even said as much to the others.The only thing I was searching for that night was a good few hours sleep.But as soon as it got dark, it started to nag at me and in the end I gave in, promising myself Id just go for a short while, an hour at the most.Three hours later I was still sitting there, telling myself to go back to the shelter where there was a comfortable sleeping bag waiting for me.But I kept giving it another five minutes, then another, and another.Where he or she came from, I dunno; wherever it was, they sure came quietly.The first I knew was hearing the hiss of the spray on the other side of the wall.I slowly got to my feet, determined not to let whoever it was get away this time, tiptoeing over the rubble, making sure I didnt dislodge any and give myself away.As long as that hissing kept on going, I had every chance of catching them cold.I slipped out into the street, tip toeing up behind them, immediately realizing it was a kid, and why Id thought they were oddly dressed: multi layered clothing, feathers in their tousled hairbut you know, I still wasnt sure if it was a boy or a girl.I grabbed whoever it was, lifted them up in the air and a voice, unquestionably that of a girl, started demanding I put her down.I did as asked, but kept a real firm grip, studying that scowling and dirty face, but Jeez, I didnt know her at all.Who the hell are you?I demanded.She hesitated for a moment as if slightly puzzled, then resumed trying to wriggle free.Get off me!she demanded, but I maintained my hold.Whats this all about?Whyre you writing these messages?This time she just shrugged, in typical teenage fashion, in fact, it kinda reminded me of Gordie.Do I know you?I asked, for some reason starting to feel that bit unsure.No, she grunted, but in such a way I knew there was some kind of story.I guessed she was somewhere in her midteens, though her face was so caked in dirt and soot I couldnt be certain.Her hair, apart from the feathers, was a bit like Lenas when I first met her in the tunnels, when she hadnt seen anyone in years; it was all rats tails and tangles.What dyou know about Lena?I asked.She paused for a moment, then, Nothing.Oh, come on!I dont know nothing!I turned and checked out the wall, seeing what she had to say this time.TO LAY DOWN AND LET LOVE DIE  So what does that mean?I asked.Nothing.You wrote it!I said, utterly frustrated.What the hell was going on here?Were you on the Island?Again she shrugged, but this time it appeared as if she was indicating the affirmative.I tell ya, those kids gotta whole alternative vocabulary of such things.I continued to stare at her; something was glimmering in a far off corner of my mind.I did know herI just couldnt remember from where.In the end she could see I was gonna get there anyway, so she decided to put me out of my misery.I fought with you against the Wastelords.We met on the way down into the Camp.Im a friend of Gordies.Gigi!I said, the name suddenly wrestling its way to the front of my mind.She just nodded, and yet, with the introduction of her name and the memory of what we shared, her attitude did appear to slightly change, as if she was trying to be that bit more human.So whats this about?I asked.Why are you leaving these messages?At first I thought she wasnt gonna say anything, then eventually she said, I dont trust grown ups.I know that, I saidits a pretty common sentiment amongst kids, especially those who were out on the Island.Eventually she gave a long drawn out sigh, like she was far from happy about it, but on balance, was prepared give me the benefit of the doubt.How much dyou know?I gave a kind of snort.Nothing.She paused for a moment.Infinityve got her.Shit!I groaned, the last glimmer of my hope finally crushed.I didnt know if you knew.Thats why I left the messages.Shit!I exclaimed again.Why?I dunno, she commented.Thought you might.She checked up and down the street, looking a little nervous, and I took her arm and led her back to my hiding place beside the wall so we could talk.Is she okay?Theyre not torturing her?Not really, she replied, in such a way it sounded like there was a story to tell.What?Shes staying in their private hospitalguarded twenty four/seven but living real five star.I tell ya, she dont want for a thing.For a moment I just stared at her.That wasnt what Id been expecting at all.How dyou know?She hesitated, and I guessed she was trying to conquer her instinctive reaction not to trust adults, to decide how much to tell me.I know...some people...They know some people.Can I get in there?I asked immediately.She scoffed, as if I was talking utter insanity.No one can get in there!Theres gotta be a way.There aint, believe me.I just need a little informationmaybe someone to turn a blind eye.Again she shook her head like there was no point in this conversation and we both fell to silence.Eventually, it was her who broke it.Is she special in some way?Shes special in every way, I told her.Gigi couldnt help herself; she gave this rather rusty, almost dirty, laugh.Must be love, she commented.I know she is to you, but, I mean, is she special to the world, dya think?Unique somehow?I stared at her, wondering what the hell she was talking about.No, I said, she can see now but...I dont know what thats gotta do with anything.I got no idea why theyd want her...Well, Gigi replied, suddenly sounding that bit older than her years, for whatever reason, theyre taking care of her as if shes a goddamn miracle.Into the Fire        THIRTEEN I hesitated over it, but in the end took her back to the shelter.She was a friend of Gordies and had gone out of her way to try to warn us about Infinity, so I reckoned I could trust her.Mind you, it gave the others a bit of a shock, especially as they were fast asleep when we got back and I asked her to stay til morning, said that she could sleep in Arturos sleeping bag.You shouldve seen the looks of absolute mystification on their faces when they awoke.Gordie was pretty pleased, you could see that, but hed never really been one to gush.He just hung out a bit of a grin and gave her a dig in the ribs when she got close enough.Delilah was plainly put out to see someone else in Arturos sleeping bag, but after a few minutes of looking like she was on the point of objecting, I guess she decided the time had come to try to move on.The only one who didnt react in any way was Hanna, which wasnt that much of a surprise, I guessbut to be honest, this felt a little different and it went through my head that maybe those two didnt get on.Not that there was anything I could do about it.Gigi told us everything thatd happened to her since shed arrived on the Mainland, expanding on what shed already said to me: that shed joined this underground group.At first I didnt quite get it, I mean, how the hell could sheve met them so quickly?But apparently when she was on the Island, she was befriended by one of the guys on the garbage boats.Hed even given her an address in case she ever managed to escape.She had no idea how many were in the groupInfinity security was that good, they never dared collect in the same place at the same time.Could be ten, could be a hundred, but again she hinted that they had people on the inside, that there were sympathizers working in Infinity, which, I gotta say, I found pretty hard to believe.But theyre taking good care of Lena?Delilah asked again, like the rest of us, still finding that hard to believe.Yeah, but...like I said, no one knows why.Id spent most of the night turning that over, trying to make some sense of it, but I tell ya, I was stumped.What made Lena specialnot just to me, but to everyone?Maybe its got something to do with the tunnels, I suggested.Whaddya mean?Gigi asked.The only thing I can think of that used to make Lena different in any way was her ability to see, to function in the dark.There was a silence that I waited to be filled with dismissive comments, but actually, everyone was looking that bit thoughtful.What good is that to them?Delilah asked.I made this gesture, like I had no idea, but Jimmy obviously wasnt short of them.Well, for example...he started to say, but suddenly he stopped and turned away.What?I asked.Oh, nothing.Just...thinking it through, he replied, though he didnt sound that convincing.Jimmy!No, reallyits nothing.If you dont tell me I threatened.I dont know!he cried.These people are definitely uncoolI wouldnt put anything past them.So what could they be up to?He sighed rather helplessly.Im not sure how much more works been done on it but...years ago, there were rumorsI mean, biotechnologys where its at, it has been for years...Its just possible theyve reached a point where they can take some facets of the human brain and integrate it into a chip...Go on, I said, a fear beginning to grow deep in my stomach.If they can stabilize the synthesis enough to clone it...After a pause he said, Skys the limit.I just sat there, not really understanding but the words still somehow mesmerizing me, waiting for him to go on.Jimmy gave a long sigh.In theory, they could give every Special her ability, either externally, through some kind of headgear, or internally, through an implant.Again he stopped, looking distinctly uncomfortable, wanting me to let him off the hookbut Id just thought of something.When I first went to see Dr.Simon, I kinda barged into his office.I thought hed have me thrown out, right away.Security were there in seconds.But when I told him all about Lena, about her life, that shed lived underground for years, blind and without any assistance, his attitude changed: suddenly he wanted to help.There was a long silence, no one quite knowing what to say.Dont mean nothing, Delilah eventually mumbled, though plainly she was as worried as the rest of us.So they keep her alive, as healthy as can be, til theyve taken whatever they want from her brain and then...I said.I couldnt complete the sentence.Nobody commented, I guess cuz they didnt like the thought of that any more than I did.If I ever see that doctor again...I muttered.Hes in Infinity, Gigi told me, looking after Lena.I grunted.Thats another good reason to get in there.Gigi said she had to go, people would be wondering where she was, but we insisted on her staying for breakfast.Thats the thing with folk nowex Islanders, the homeless, anyoneif youre offered food, you dont turn it down.Who knows when you might next get a chance to eat?While we were all sitting there, slurping some stewed fruit, Gigi reminiscing with Gordie about stuff thatd happened in the Camp on the Island, Hanna pointedly not joining in, she suddenly stopped.I thought Arturo was with you?There was a really heavy pause, so heavy, she instantly knew what it meant.Oh, she said.Howd that happen?Infinity Clean up, I told her.They took his bodycan you believe that?Delilah grumbled, almost as if she was pleased to find someone new to tell.Yeah, I can, Gigi replied.What dya mean?Delilah asked, a little aggressively.What its worth.We all turned to Gigi, waiting for an explanation.What are you talking about?I asked.She stared at us one by one.You really dont know anything, do you?No, I cried in frustration, we dont!She gave this long sigh, like she really didnt see why this particular duty fell to her.You seen all those sick people?Zombies, Gordie said, weakly managing to make a face.They got this mystery illnesscauses all kinds of shit: blindness, burning, headaches, nausea...organ failure...With that pause, the underlining of those last two words, a look of revulsion slowly spread across Delilahs face.Is that why they took him?Gigi nodded.Oh no!No!Delilah moaned, her bony and veined hands clasped to her mouth, her horror stricken eyes staring out from above them.For several moments there was silence, no one wanting to talk over her grief.When Gigi finally continued, she spoke in little more than a whisper, as if to show her respect.Remember how they used to transport kids bodies back over from the Island?I flinched.That was one of the main reasons Id wanted to destroy that place.Well, she said, almost matter of factly, no more supplyand a helluva lot more demand.Is that why they get all excited when they see kids?Gordie asked.Were just walking displays of spare parts, she informed him.Which is why you so rarely see any kids in the City, I said.Everyones after usespecially enticers.What the hells an enticer?Nice name for not nice people: back street butchers, organ pushersthey got all these ways of tempting kids into going with them: money, drugs, food, sometimes just candy.Next thing they know they wake up somewhere with one of their kidneys gone.If theyre really unlucky, both of them.Like to see them try, Gordie said defiantly.I wouldnt, Gigi warned, not from what I heard.And it aint just kids either: somell steal organs already stolen.The same kidney might get transplanted into several different bodies.You gotta watch out: if they think you got something worth taking, theyll cut you open now and ask questions later.Jesus!Jimmy gasped.So whats the sickness?No one knows, she said.Some peopleespecially Infinitygive their staff masks, but whether they do any good?She shrugged again, her who the hell knows?shrug.We sat there for a while trying to take it all in.The fact that blindness was one of the symptoms was causing me an understandable measure of concern.But its got nothing to do with Lena?I dunno, Gigi answered.Nope, and I didnt either.It was just one unbearable possibility after another.Bad enough that Infinity might be about to steal from her mind; now there was a chance they were out to steal from her body as well.When wed finished eating, Gigi got up to leave.She thanked us for the food and we said our goodbyes, told her she was always welcome but to be careful how she entered the churchyard, then Gordie walked her out.I think we all felt kinda exhausted having to absorb all that new information, like a typhoon had just swept through us.Can we trust her?Jimmy asked.Think so, I replied.Hanna hesitated in that way she has when you know shes about to speak.Maybe, she eventually said.Why dyou say that?I asked.No reason.Just...maybe.I stared at her for a moment.Id never heard her say a bad word about anyone before, apart from Gordie, of course.What the hell did she know about Gigi?I didnt do a great deal the rest of that day, just hung around the churchyard thinking things through.I got it into my head to hunt through the rubble for Arturos cross.I knew itd been smashed into an uncountable number of pieces, but after a lot of searching, I finally found a fragment with the Kid of Mickey Mouse Kid on it.I held in my hand, the stone slowly warming.For some reason it gave me a small measure of comfort.This situation had been daunting enough before, but now it was an oncoming flood laden with all manner of dark flotsam.Would it really be possible for Infinity to steal Lenas ability to function without light?I could understand why theyd want to: if the Specials could see in the dark, theyd be even more formidable.Or was there something else they wanted from her?Did this have more to do with the zombie sick?I just didnt know, and nothing really fitted together, not neatly, not sos you couldnt see the joins.The most chilling question was: how long would it take them to get whatever they wanted from her?And, of course, what would they do with her afterward?I sighed to myself, repeatedly tossing the Kid a few feet into the air and catching it, for one absurd moment thinking I heard Arturos shrieking laughter in that spit second just before he didnt know if you were going to catch him or not.Thank God Lena was apparently safe for the moment, cuz sure as hell I didnt even have the scent of an idea how to bust her out of that place.Everyone was saying it was impossible, and going on what Id seen, they were probably rightbut that didnt mean I shouldnt try.The problem was, everything was inside that building: Lena, Dr.Simon, the reason why they took her...Suddenly I stopped, a thought so preoccupying me I let the Kid fall to the ground.Just a goddam minute: there was one thing...I love setting Jimmy problems.You know instantly if it cant be done cuz he looks at you as if you just failed a sanity test, like you should surely know no one can do that, not even him.On the other hand, when he makes that screwed up face, takes in that long breathy whistle, like youre talking about uncharted territory but he just might be the one person prepared to venture there, you know you gotta chance, that once hes made sure you appreciate just how difficult it is, he might actually be able to pull it off.Wed already discussed hacking into Infinity, what problems that might presentand the risks were just too greatbut what we hadnt considered was Dr.Simons private clinic.Maybe we could grab a look at Lenas notes, get some more idea why they took her.With this?the little guy said, snatching the screen from Gordie midgame, inducing a long, mournful groan.If anyone can do it I said.Jimmy gave a dismissive chuckle, recognizing some clumsy schmoozing when he heard it.Yeah, yeah.Thats a good idea, Clancy, Delilah chipped in.It might be linked to Infinity, Jimmy told us, just in case we hadnt realized what hed be up against.You can do it!Delilah said, making it sound so easy, such a small challenge, I was worried he might walk away cuz it wasnt worthy of his talents.I dont know if it was that, his need to play up the task, but when he finally did get down to it, he really took his time, forever complaining about having to break down this, configure that, and, Jeez, there are encryptions everywhere!Occasionally hed cuss and shake his head, like it was high time he gave up, but I didnt know if it was genuine or if he was just setting us up to appreciate how clever he was when he finally triumphed.Now and then hed turn to me, just to confirm some information.Dr.Simon?Yep.Evan Simon?Thats him.Whoa, he said, studying his screen.Cool.What?Got more letters than the alphabet.Are you in?Not to patients recordsnot yet.And then you knew he wasnt going to speak for a while, that it was useless trying to keep the conversation going.He would talk again when he had something to say and not before.That went on for the best part of the day.I forced myself to go out for a while, returning an hour or more later, but I dont think hed even noticed my absence.Finally he turned to me.Whats her name?You know her name Surname!Oh...Oh Jeez, I dunnohow many Lenas are there?None.Shit!No record of her?He shrugged.Maybesome odd names here.Could be hes the soul of discretion.Or maybe hes just covering his tracks.She told me once she was of Swedish extraction, I suddenly remembered.Does that help?Mm, he said, obviously looking through a list of names.Karllson?Maybe.He handed me the screen.The name Sonia Linekar was highlighted.I shook my head, not understanding.Whats this?Its a crude kinda encryption.He alters the syllable order, then plays around with the letters, like here.Lena Karllson: the son at the end goes at the front and she becomes Sonia.Lena Karll becomes Linekar.Jesus, I was impressedif itd been left to me, we wouldve been there til Doomsday.Take a look, he told me.Its privateI dont think I should.I tapped the screen and up came a lot of details: age, description, medical notes.Much as it pains me to say itexasperating little cuss that he is at timesonce again I was reminded that the guy was a genius, no two ways about it.What does it say?Gordie asked.I looked up and realized four eager faces were staring at me, waiting for my news.Nothing very interesting.Must be something, Delilah said.I went over it again.No allergies, no problems, no...special talents or gifts.Then suddenly I stopped and started laughing.Well, well.So Jimmy does get it wrong sometimes.Its not her, I said.Must be, he said, immediately on the defensive.Its not, I said, handing him back the screen.I sat there while he studied it, smirking to myself, waiting for him to see, but he didnt react the way Id expected.Jimmy, its not her!I said, annoyed that he always found it so hard to admit to his mistakes.It cant be, can it?Well, obviously I dont know her as well as you do, Big Guy, he replied, his words fairly dripping with sarcasm, but I certainly remember the cut she got on her throat from that kid who broke into the tunnels.I stared at him for a moment, at the expression on his face, then grabbed the screen back, scrutinizing every little detail.Well, Jimmy said, are you going to tell them, or am I?In a world of bombshells and bolts from the blue, a society where nothing surprised me, I gotta say, that really took the ground out from beneath my feet.I mean, dumb old big guy or what?Id been saying for ages how well she was looking, that she was bloomingId subconsciously put it down to escaping from the Island...If I hadnt read that screen, it would never have occurred to me, not for one moment, but there it was: Lena was pregnant...Pregnant!...Jesus, shes gonna have a baby!My first reaction was shamingbelieve me, it said everything about me and not a thing about her.Whos the father?I asked.They all stared at me like they couldnt believe their ears, then Delilah burst into laughter and Jimmy swiftly followed suit.Who the hell do you think the father is?Delilah cackled, and Gordie had the cheek to say hed tell me the facts of life one day.Ten weeks pregnant, Jimmy said, reading off the screen.I just continued to gape, knowing my mouth was wide open but unable to close it.Like I said, my reaction was all about me, nothing to do with Lena.I wasnt accusing her of lying or sneaking out the tunnels to meet someone, or anything like thatnever even crossed my mindI justwell, Im gonna say this just the once and please do excuse meI just didnt think I had it in me any more!I admit, wed never used a condom.Id never even seen one on the Islandwell, not a new one; course, there were plenty of used ones around but I wasnt going there, washed out or not.In any case, neither Lena nor me had slept with anyone in years, so there werent any dread diseases we could pass between us.Andwell, like I said, I didnt think I was up to getting anyone pregnant.Jimmy looked at me, the biggest smile I ever seen on him spreading across his face like a sunrise.Youre gonna be a dad, Big Guy.It was the most disturbing thing anyoned ever said to me, and for any number of reasons.I never dreamed Id have a kidnot at that stage of my life.And yet, there I was, a father to be, but a father who might never get to see his baby, nor see again the woman he created it with.And it wasnt just me who didnt know how to react either.Jimmy mentioned about getting out this half bottle of whisky he took from the Superfood 7, proposing a toast, but Delilah shook her head at him.Instead she came over and putting her long, skinny old arms around me, told me it was going to be all right.And yet once again it was Hanna who came up with the most comforting words.I think its great, she said.Itll make you stronger.More able to fight.And you know, the moment she said it, I did feel stronger, more focused, more determined.It wasnt just Lena being held in that place now, it was our child tooand come hell or high water, I was gonna get them both out.It immediately set me thinking.Years ago, when the economy was entering its final death throes and the government was forced into selling off the family silver, they started phasing out the army and getting rid of its hardware.As long as you had the dough, theyd pretty well sell you anything, no questions asked.At the time, Mr.Meltoni was having a bit of a problem with this new gang of Eastern Europeans trying to move in on us.He knew it was heading for a showdown and decided to go out and get something to even up the odds a little.You shouldve seen those guys: mean as hell, standing in a line across Union North, stony faced and scowling, all holding these big businesslike automatics, forbidding us to enter their territory.Then they heard something approaching: this creaking and clanking, getting ever closer, all of them starting to glance nervously at one another.Finally, Mr.Meltoni came swinging around the corner, dressed in a generals uniform, ribbons and medals all over his chest, at the head of a column of four M1 battle tanks, 120mm guns pointing directly at those determined not to let them pass.I tell ya, you never seen negotiations concluded in such rapid fashion.By the weekend theyd all gone, just melted away.That was what I needed to get me into Infinity: reinforcements of a truly spectacular nature.And yet, even if Id had those M1s, Im not sure how confident Id have been.The whole situation was so fraught and frightening and I didnt have the slightest idea how to go about solving it.What I didnt know was that Fate was about to throw one more ingredient into the mix.I decided to go out, to give the others some talking space, intending to take another look at Infinity.If I couldve found just one weakness with that place, no matter how small, you have no idea how much encouragement it wouldve given me.I said the fires were starting to die down, but there were still plenty aroundplenty of everything bad: fires, smoke, looters, mob rule, and everywhere I went, more and more corpsesalways the elderly for some reason, as if, even in death, no one could be bothered with them, they had no value.I thought Id seen just about everything in terms of the fires, but I still gotta bit of a jolt when I turned a corner and was met by this burning office block.It was a tall, thin column of flame that had somehow ignited the same two adjacent floors in buildings on either side, so I was confronted by this huge burning cross.Christianity doesnt mean much anymore but you still couldnt help but see it in those terms, like it was some kind of sign.I stood there for several minutes, not only looking at the fire, but also at the expressions on the faces of the crowd gathering around me.It was as if they were still a touch bitter that God had let them down, at the way hed disowned them all those years ago.I was just about to turn around and head off when something hard was pressed into my back.I wouldnt have taken you for a religious man, someone said behind me.I turned slowly.I hadnt recognized the voice, but I did the face.It was Van, Rays main man, with his greasy little sidekick.And talking of religion, he continued, I know someone whod love you to make a Second Coming.Into the Fire        FOURTEEN Talk about Fate conspiringas if I didnt have enough to worry about.They handcuffed me to one of the armrests in the limono way was I going to be allowed out of their sight again.I spent the entire journey trying to think of a way to escape, but in the end accepted there just wasnt one and I might as well shut down and try to conserve my energy for whatever was waiting for me at Rays.They mustve let him know they were about to pick me up cuz he didnt look in the slightest bit surprised when I was brought inon the other hand, Ive rarely seen a human being look more furious, more venomous toward another.He wasnt sitting in his armchair but in a hi tech wheelchair, squat and powerful looking with really thick tires, with his bloated legs cocooned in a weird projecting, almost pointed metal frame.The moment I walked in he started screaming abuse at me, ramming his joystick forward and coming at me so fast I didnt have a hope in hell of getting out the way.My shins took the full force of the blow.You stupid fucker!he screamed.Jesus!I groaned, feeling like hed swung a sledgehammer at my legs, but he just reversed back and accelerated forward again, this time hitting me so hard, I ended up on the floor.Jeez, that was why he was in that damn contraption: it was the Wheelchair of Death and he was going to ram me into oblivion.I told you not to fucking kill him!he screamed, and suddenly he was that crazy kid again, all those years ago, beating the hell out of me, pounding me senseless on the sidewalk.I didnt kill him, I protested.He fell!Fuck you!he shouted.Do you know how much fucking shit you got me into?She knew it was me right away.It was an accident!Yeah, and sos this, he sneered, hitting me with such momentum, I skidded across the polished floor and slammed into the wall, blood instantly running from a cut on my head.Boss, Van muttered, plainly a little concerned that Ray appeared to be bent on killing me then and there.Again that wheelchair whirled toward me and though I tried to scramble aside, it slammed into me once more, almost dislocating my shoulder.For a moment I teetered on the edge of unconsciousness, the sound of his screaming voice, ironically, the only thing that stopped me from passing out altogether.I opened my eyes to see this slobbering mouth only inches from me, a rubber band of spit hanging from top to bottom lip, projecting over me as if he was about to vomit.The bile he was expelling was coming from somewhere much deeper and even more noxious than his body, as if all the shitall the poisonhed accumulated over the years had been building up to that one moment.Wheres my fucking money?he screeched, his bulging face redder than a baboons ass.Gone, I managed to grunt.I wouldnt have thought it possible, but he got even angrier, reversing back as far as he could go, then racing toward me and slamming me up against the wall, pinning me to it, revving his motor as hard as he could, trying to crush me.You useless fuck!Ill turn you into a fucking blood and bone smoothie!Plainly he still hated me as much as ever; time hadnt mellowed him one bit.He went back and fired himself at me again, the projecting front of that thing making it look like a damn missile was coming my way.Van kind of cleared his throat, trying to calm Ray down, maybe to remind him that they didnt want a body on the premises.I opened my mouth to speak, to beg for mercy, but it was full of blood and I started choking.Stop!I eventually managed to gurgle.There was a momentary pause, but I couldnt clear my eyes enough to see why; was he trying to calm himself down or merely out of breath?Either way, I knew I couldnt take any more of this, that I had to save myself somehow, and suddenly words started pouring out of my mouth that I swear werent mine, like the first I knew of them was when I heard them along with everyone else.I can get you more money than you ever dreamed of.Fuck you!Ray sneered, and reversed again, ready to slam into me once more.Billions.He just sat there glaring at me, joystick in hand, clearly wanting to launch himself again, but momentarily checked by the mention of such an enormous sum of money.Its the biggest heist in history, and only I know about it.Id overdone itI knew that as soon as the words were out of my mouth.He shot forward again, pounding into me even as I yelled, Its true!Again he paused.Tell meand if I think youre lying, this is gonna feel like a massage compared to whatll follow.Theres this woman, I managed to croak out.In the Infinity building.Oh, fuck you!he groaned at the mere mention of Infinitys name.Shes blindor she was.I was panting now, trying not to rush my words, grateful for whatever respite I could get.She lived underground on the Island for yearskinda developed these skills...They want to clone them and give them to the Specials I didnt actually know if that was true, but I thought it the most likely thing for Ray to believe.I was going to kidnap her...Theyll pay anything to get her back.Infinity?Ray sneered.Yeah.You wanna kidnap someone from Infinity?Theyre not so great, I told him, trying to summon up at least a pretense of confidence.Have you seen that place close up?
