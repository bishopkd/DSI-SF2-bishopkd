Youre practically wearing a sign around your neck that says, I broke.His eyes get wide.You werent there.You dont know That they tortured you?That they took you apart?It was pretty obvious.Ben...Fine.They broke you.They would have broken any of us.Me, you, Brana, Rosie Ben!He slaps both hands down on the console, and the sound reverberates around us.His neck is rigid, the tendons visible.I freeze.He closes his eyes.When he speaks his voice is tight.Its not that I broke.Youre right.Anyone wouldve.Its that I got caught in the first place.He shakes his head, then rubs a hand over his head.I asked too many questions, or maybe I asked the wrong questions, or Diego, I say.Jesus.Thats what youre upset about?He levels me with a stare that practically staggers me.I shake my head.Who knows what tipped them off?Maybe they were on alert because of what we did with Miranda and the lab.Maybe they just got lucky.You saw how it was up there.A bunch of psychotic, bloodthirsty madmen with a bunch of cruel, insanely intelligent scientists behind them.We were all outclassed.He looks down.The moment sits like that for a minute or so.Then I say, I think the ultimate moral of this tale is that next time you and I should stick together and Miranda can stay with Rosie.Rosies certainly not going to stick with you, he says, the hint of a smile on his face.I shake my head.Diego, your sister scares me.He nods again.I know.I laugh.I cant help myself.He shrugs.Youll work it out.Youll have to.Really?I ask.He shrugs again.Youll either work it out, or...Or what?Or shell probably end up kicking your ass.I resolve to myself to try to work it out.When Tess had told me about a prison camp, I hadnt imagined an actual camp.I thought they might take shelter in a school or an old office building.Someplace where they would have hard walls between them and Ferals.Someplace where they would have a roof, or multiple roofs, between them and the air.I figured they took scientists for a reason and that theyd have to do experiments or analyze data or something.A school would seem ideal.But no, the Cabal for whatever reason has created an actual camp.Not for the first time, I find I cant fathom what theyre doing or why.Below us, as shown on the monitors, is a series of tents and other temporary structures.A thick wire fence surrounds these, topped with barbed wire.Mostly good against Ferals, but not completely safe.Ive seen Ferals climb, and Ive seen some shrug off serious wounds when in the grips of hunger.Thats why theyve constructed another fence on the inside, with a series of spikes or sharpened poles or whatever inside that ring.If a Feral manages to climb over the outer fence, hes going to have a hard time getting through that inner layer.And Im sure there are traps as well.A couple of gates allow access inside and out.Id guess a guard is stationed in front of it at all times, but I cant really make one out at this resolution.Im amazed at how open it is, I say to Diego.Hes bent over the screens, taking it all in.The sun is setting and we have only a few moments to get a clear look at the structure.Lucky for us, he says.Yeah.I shake my head.Maybe its a cut and run operation, he says.Theyre not valuable enough.If something goes wrong, they get out and leave your friends on their own.Maybe, I say.The boffins are fairly capable people, but a group of them on their own in the open would make easy targets for anyone.I make a quick sketch of the layout on the edge of one of the maps so I can remember.I look out the gondola and see the last of the suns orange glow slip beneath the horizon.Okay, I say.Hit that switch.Diego does, and the infrared monitor springs to life.This is why I insisted we take the Dumah in addition to the Osprey.Weve seen the structure, now we need to see whos inside it.Outlined on the screen are the red, yellow, and green glowing blobs of the heat down below us.The people are easy to see, thin slashes of color.Larger blobs appear to be fires.Good God, Diego says.This is incredible.I know, I say.Perhaps the most impressive of the Dumahs many eyes.As expected, in front of the gate is a guard, and what I take to be several others move around inside the fence.I mark them as guards because of their movements, within a certain area, back and forth.Stopping here and there.By far, though, the majority of the heat blobs are scattered among where Id seen several of the tents earlier.As we watch, one blob moves to each of the tents, and then all the blobs inside move out into the center of the compound, line up into two orderly lines, then move into the largest tent, where they all settle into their own spaces and stay there.Makes sense, I say.Its dark.They probably want to preserve whatever energy they have.Solar, Id guess.Maybe feeding time, Diego says.I nod.Obviously the boffins are valuable enough to feed.Its generally accepted that the three most valuable resources are food, fuel or power, and ammunition.The boffins have to be worth something for the Cabal to spend so much food on them on a regular basis.It maybe explains why they are where they are and this place seems lightly guarded.Theyre already expending enough resources on them.They cant spare more.You get a count?I ask.Thirteen, I think.Inside the big tent.And the guards?He looks up at me.Four.Four?I look down, and it looks like hes right.All the guards I had spotted before, patrolling, and that was it.Id expected more.Of both, sadly.Wed lost more boffins than that at the Core.But its better than nothing.Id assumed wed taken casualties.The raiders who took the place werent gentle.And the Ferals theyd dropped inside must have done some damage.Four, I repeat.I nod to myself.We can do that.I know, Diego says.The trick is going to be getting in.Theres no roof, I say.Yeah, but what are we going to do, lower the ship right down on top of them?I smile.Why not?What if they start shooting the prisoners?My smile fades.What do you suggest?Drop me down outside the fence.I can take out the guard at the front.It should create enough of a distraction that you can get in at this corner.He points to my map.If I can take one out and attract anothers attention, that will leave two for you.No.I slam one hand down on the console.No way.Youll be an easy dinner for any Ferals that happen to be around.No cover.No place to run.Not to mention that your arm is still healing.How are you going to fire a gun?Im a good shot with one hand.I can do this.He points to the screen.There are no places for nests nearby.We looked.And there are no other heat traces.And the minute you start shooting, any Feral within hearing distance is going to come sniffing around.Well be out by then.Jesus, Diego.I sigh.Then Ill be the distraction and you go in.He shakes his head.I dont know the scientists.Youre going to have to do it.Damn it, Diego.Ben, he says.His eyes bore into mine.And Im thinking, Dont say it.Just dont...You owe me this.He said it.Im aware of how ridiculous this is.I put him into harms way before, and now hes asking me to make it up to him by doing it again.I look back at the infrared monitor and the bright figures there.People I couldnt save before.Fine.Do it, is what I hear myself say.My insides clench up a bit, but its like Ive already flipped the switch to Go, and I start positioning the Dumah to lower Diego to the ground.Im going to have to put you down at a distance, I say.Cant risk them seeing us.You going to be able to move okay?Ive been exercising a lot, Ben.I may be in better shape than I was before we went to Gastown.Like hell, I think.I grab his hand, which is now covered with a worn leather glove.Dont make me regret this.I lower him down on the side opposite the gate.It will mean more walking for him but less chance of us being seen.Were dark and quiet, but we still block out the stars.Luckily for us, theres enough cloud cover tonight to help hide us.Diego hits the ground, and I start moving to the edge of the compound.I flick on the radio and grab the transmitter.Rosie, I say.After a moment she comes back to me.Yeah.Start moving in.Come in from the north.I want their attention focused there.Wheres Diego?she asks.My stomach tightens again.Hes busy right now.Just count off five minutes then move in.Okay, she says.I huff out a breath, then flip the radio off.Then prepare to lower the Dumah so that I can go down to my least favorite place in the world.The ground.My first thought as my boots touch ground is that it smells like shit.Literally.There must be a latrine or something nearby.Figuresyou have to put it somewhere.Im glad my mouth is covered with my scarf.My next thought is how comfortable and normal it feels to be covered from head to toe with clothes.Which makes me sad about how paranoid I am about infection.It also makes me think of Miranda and the two of us naked, and so my next thought is that I need to focus on the task at hand.I hear gunshots and hope that means Diego is taking out the guards.At the very least it should mean that Diego is still alive.Unless some Ferals have got him and thats what theyre shooting at.Focus, Ben.I have the revolver out and Im crouching, moving steadily but not too fast.The first tent is empty.I see a bunch of simple tables inside with stuff on top of them.Its too dark to make them out too well.I find myself wishing for the ability to see in infrared, but of course thats just ridiculous.But it would be really cool.The next tent resembles the one I just passed, and the next.I dont see anyone, though I check each one quickly.Its dark.Really dark.The clouds that helped to hide the Dumah are also hiding the moon, and the starlight only does so much.There are fires, though.I can see them off in the direction of the gate.That helps give me my bearings to find the big tent.I start moving and hear a yell in the distance, but I cant tell if its from pain or triumph.It makes me freeze for just a second, and thats when someone tackles me and I fall to the ground on my back, the air in my lungs squeezed out by the weight on top of me.He pins my gun arm to the side, pressing hard.Hes bigger than me, stronger.Heavier.Correctionshe.I look up into a womans face, bandana or scarf tied bandit style across it.A nose broke in several places.One eye scarred at the edges.The face zooms toward me and then disappears in a blast of pain as her skull connects with mine.Then her fist hits me hard in the side.I reel from the pain and my hand, now freed, wants to fly up to my ringing skull, but instead I send it up to hers.Not the mouth, I think.The eyes.Her free hand reaches up to grab at mine, and I know shes stronger.And her legs on top of me are squeezing, and Im still struggling to get enough breath in me.My right hand, with the revolver in it, is already numb.But I keep clawing for her eye.She starts forcing my hand away and I try to keep it there, but I cant.Shes stronger and Im getting weaker, but as my hand slips away I manage to grab the bottom part of her nose with my gloved fingers.I give it a hard jerk, and for a moment her head moves and I feel her weight shift and, tensing my whole body, I push myself to that side, and she slips a bit off of me.I manage to get a fist into the side of her face as I inhale and I slam the same fist on her ear and then into her throat.The bandana isnt too thick, and so I hammer her again and again.She falls back for a moment, trying to suck in breath herself, and her hand comes off of my revolver hand.Its weak, but I bring up my numb hand only to realize Ive lost my grip on the revolver.She hits me hard in the face, and I feel the warm wetness of blood somewhere.I raise my free hand and shift to one side so that the second blow gets me between my chin and chest.It hurts but not as much.I aim my revolver hand for her throat again but she catches it, so I go for her eyes again with my left hand, and this time my fingers find it.She roars in pain.I manage to roll her off of me, punching and kicking at her where I can.I see the revolver, lying on the ground, and I scramble for it.She scrambles after me.With a hurt eye and an injured throat, she keeps after me, punching me in the stomach, in the chest, then in the groin, so close to where it would have curled me into pain.Then my fingers curl around the grip of the revolver, I swing it around, and my finger finds the trigger.Boom.The shot is hasty and aimed poorly, but its so close.It takes her in the space between her shoulder and neck, and the flesh there is suddenly wet meat.I push her back and scramble away as the blood sprays, blood that may be infected.I have no way of knowing.My ears are ringing and pain is leaping through my body from injury to injury, but Im alive.I get to my feet and move toward the tent, this time keeping a firm grip on the revolver.Any hope of surprise is gone.When I get to the tent, standing in the entrance is another guard, dressed in furs and leathers.He holds a large automatic to the head of one of the boffins, a man I recognize.His names Anders.For a quick flash I feel a wash of relief, relief that its true.That the boffins, our boffins, are here.Then fear as I realize that I might lose one of them.Then anger at the animal holding the gun to Anderss head.I quickly wrangle the anger under control.Drop your gun, the guard says.And I know I should.But I dont.If he shoots Anders, he has nothing.Ill shoot him easily.And he has to know that.But then again, he looks like hes from Valhalla and I dont know how much reason goes into their decisions.Im fighting with myselfmake a decision, Benand I decide to lower the gun.I dont want to take any chances with the boffins lives.The guards eyes are on mine, and mine on his.I will my hand to lower.It doesnt immediately move, so I will it harder.Then, before I actually move, the guards hand falters.I dont know whether he suddenly thinks that maybe the boffins arent important to me, or maybe he realizes the position hes in, but his hand moves for a moment and one of the boffins slams something into the side of the guards head.At the same time, Anders wriggles free, and as the opening appears, I drop to ground and shoot up at the guard.The hammer comes down, noise fills the air, and my shot hits the raider in the head, blowing his brains out against the back of the tent.I get to my feet and cross the distance to the tent.Inside I see many familiar facesdirty and stained, thin and bedraggledbut people I know.Is everyone okay?I ask.Several people say yes; there are a lot of nods.I notice they had almost all dropped to the ground.Smart.Physics is something they understand, the trajectory of the bullet.And they know, possibly more than anyone, how the virus spreads.That had been my fear, that even if they stayed out of the way of the bullet, that someone would get splattered with blood.Because who knows if that guard was clean.Stay here for a moment, I say, then move off toward the gate.I see two dead guards there.Diego?I call out.Im here, he calls back.Get that door open.I exhale heavily in relief and then move toward the gates, opening the first and then the second.Diego comes in, breathing hard.Did they get you?I ask.No, he says.He smiles.I told you I could do it.Yeah, well lets not do it again.As we move back toward the large tent, the bulk of the Osprey appears overhead.Time to get Mirandas people home, I say.FIFTEEN I fly back to Tamoanchan alone.Rosie insists on Diego coming back with her.To help with the boffins, she says.She suddenly has thirteen additional people on board and she has to fly the ship.Only eleven of the prisoners are Mirandas people, though.That leaves nine of her colleagues unaccounted for.The other two boffins we rescued were apparently taken from a different facility east of the Rockies.Its nice to know there are others out there looking for a cure.For the first time in a long time I feel, well, satisfied.We managed to rescue the boffins without any casualties.Diego ended up okay.Were headed back to Tamoanchan, where Miranda and her reunited friends will work on a cure and at the very least are likely to come up with a detection system for the virus.Sure, Valhalla and the Cabal are still out there, but we have a place to go.And for the first time in a while, we have hope.Im still feeling that lightness, that sense of buoyancy, as I hit the ground on Tamoanchanand Im even smiling when Rosie strides up to me and punches me in the mouth.I hit the ground, my head still spinning as she stands over me.Get up, she says.Go on, get up.What the fuck, Rosie, I manage to say.Blood smears across my hand as I wipe my face.You let my brother down on the ground without backup?Out in the open?Hes injured, you dogfucker.Get up!It was his idea, I say, though now it sounds a little weak to me.I dont get up, though.Because if I do either shes going to knock me back down to the ground or Im going to have to fight her, and neither of those options appeal to me.Get.Up.Now.No.If you want to hit me again, you have to do it while Im on the ground.Dont think I wont.Rosie!Its Diego, running up and pulling her back.What the fuck is wrong with you?Leave me alone, she says, slipping free of his good arm.This is between me and Ben.He stares at her.It was my decision.She grimaces and shakes her head.If you have an issue with that, take it up with me.She leans forward, putting her face right up in his.Youre both fucking idiots.She shakes her head again.You should know better.But by all means, if you want to die or worse, keep hanging around with Ben.Youll get each other killed.Im sure.Rosie...She shrugs off his questing hand.No.Just ...leave me alone.She points at me.This isnt over.Stay clear of me or else this is back on.I nod.After she walks away, Diego helps me to my feet.She really doesnt like me, I say.To be fair, Diego says.Not many people do.I wipe my lip and dust myself off.Too much blood lately.Id had Diego check me over back at the prison camp to make sure I didnt get any of the one guards blood on me.Looked like it only got on my clothes.Which I need to wash right away.Thing is, were not on Tamoanchan proper.That wasnt the agreement with Lewis.We were bringing back the boffins, and there were too many for the quarantine cells, so we came straight to the island that they set aside for Mirandas research.What theyve taken to calling the Orchard.Its not very bigmostly a hilltop with some trees, some sandy, rocky ground nearby.Room enough for us but little else.The bright spot is that we can do our quarantine here and not have to worry about sweating it out in some cell somewhere.Of course theyre corralling us.Were in a fenced off area with several hastily erected tents.On the ground again.I cant help feeling apprehensive as the Dumah and the Osprey move away, piloted by two peacekeepers from the big island.Im starting to feel like this is what the rest of my life is going to bean endless series of quarantines with the occasional interruption.I stick close to Diego while trying to steer clear of Rosie.This is easier than I think since she doesnt seem to want anything to do with either of us.I wish we had something to drink, I say.Diego pulls open his black jacket and removes a tarnished metal flask.That whiskey we had back at my place.You sneaky bastard.He smiles.What are you going to drink?Emphasis on the bastard.He shrugs and his smile widens.He reaches into another pocket and pulls out a pack of playing cards, holding it out in an invitation.Now, Ive played Diego in cards beforehes good.Too good.But theres not a lot else to do.I shrug.Ill play you for a pull of that flask.What are you going to bet?A drink at the Frothy Brew, I say.As soon as we get out of here and back to the main island.And if you dont make it out of quarantine?I flash him a wounded look.Then Miranda will cover it.He shakes his head.Ben, you are such a hustler.Are we going to play or not?He shakes his head again, but then pulls the cards out and starts to shuffle.Lets just say that when he gives me a sip, its because he feels sorry for me.Damn, Diegos good at cards.Miranda finds me as I move up the hill after my release from quarantine.She runs to me and wraps her arms around me.Tight.And I feel this rush of warmth in my chest.I hadnt realized how much Id been looking forward to seeing her.Thank you for bringing my people back to me.I flash her a smile.I have to use my boffin wrangling skills somehow.Her face gets serious.You did good.As I feel my face flush, her eyes scan my face.Seems you didnt escape unscathed.I wince.I ran into one of the guards.She got in a few good shots.She reaches out, touching my lip.This ones opened.I flinch from her touch, my naked blood, but of course I just went through quarantine.That ...was Rosie.Rosie?I wince and rub a hand across the back of my head.To get the boffins out we needed a distraction.Diego was that distraction, but it meant dangling him out in the open.What?He wanted to go.He said he needed to go.She shakes her head.And you went along with that?I shrug.He ...convinced me.I wanted him to be able to prove himself.She continues to shake her head.Ben...It worked out okay.We got the boffins back.She meets my eyes.And if you hadnt?If Diego had ended up shot, or worse?It didnt happen.But it could have.I know, I say.It was a risk.I made a call.We got your people out.She looks away from me.The moment stretches into silence.I need to go see them, she says at last.Yeah, I say.Why dont you go see Sergei, she says, still looking away.He was asking about you.I nod and move up the hill as she moves down.Sergei is one of Mirandas closest friends.Hell, hes more of a father to hertook over after her father died, back when she was in her teens.Theyve been searching for a cure together.Hes a good guy, Sergei is.A little stiff, but good.I head to the makeshift lab that they assembled.Truth is, I havent seen Sergei, or Clay, another of Mirandas scientists, since we first came to Tamoanchan.Clay is a little shit I couldnt care less about, but Im looking forward to seeing Sergei.Hes not like a father to me, only my actual father was ever that, but the way I feel about him is the way I imagine someone might feel about an uncle.Not that I had one or ever really knew one, but its what I imagine.I cant resist cracking a grin as he looks up from his pile of papers and smiles at me.Ben!he calls.Then hes walking over to me and clapping me in an awkward but heartfelt hug.Hes still wearing that strange nautical hat he always wears, white with an anchor on the front.I notice that he looks older.His beard and hair were always grey, but the lines in his face seem deeper, especially those around his mouth.You made it back, he says.I did.I told you I would.You did, he says.And you brought Miranda with you.Thank you.Dont thank me, I say.She kept me alive.Hell, she stole our ride back here.I dont even think she needs me anymore.I dont think she needs any of us, he says.He smiles.Maybe I should give up science, take up farming instead.I raise my eyebrows.I dont know that Miranda will let that happen.But maybe I can help you set up a secret garden somewhere.He laughs.You?I laugh back.Good point.He smiles.I think well be too busy with Mirandas virus detection project.Yeah, I say.I figured youd be all hands on that.Clay appears from a back room, wiping his hands on a cloth.He sees me and gives me the tiniest of nods.Ben.Clay.Manage to blow up any ships today?he asks, not able to resist taking a shot.I know hes doing it to rile me uphe thinks Im slow and stupidand I tell myself to ignore it, but hes talking about my ship.The one I lost.The one I loved.The one I sacrificed so that people like him could I realize that Ive taken a few steps toward him.I force myself to stop.No, I say.I brought you some of your friends back.Sergei looks questioningly at me.Youre out of quarantine...I nod.So they are, too.Sergeis smile is a kilometer wide.Cmon, Clay, he says.Let us go welcome them.Clay glares at me as he leaves but does leave.And then Im alone.This is going to be fun, just me and the boffins, alone on this island.Just like old times.Then I remember that Diego is still here, too, and I go try to find him and see if we can dig up a bottle of booze.That night, theres a big celebration.Turns out Sergei has been distilling some of his own hooch using the islands crops, and a jug of it has already been passed around several times.Lewis, our new patron, even sent over some extra food for us.Which is a good thing because the boffins are ravenous.Turns out they didnt get fed very well out in that prison camp.Me, Im all for drinking, and for celebrating, especially when theres something to celebrate, but Im also interested in what was going on in the camp.And the more we know about whats going on with Valhalla and the Cabal, the more we can do to prepare for a possible assault.I end up talking to Crazy Osaka as he jams some fish in his mouth and washes it down liberally with some of Sergeis hooch.I remember asking Miranda once how he got his name.I figured he was known for doing, well, crazy things.Miranda explained that it was because he had such outlandish scientific theories.I was disappointed.But thats the boffins.So they had you doing what?Experiments?Mostly reviewing data, he says, his mouth full.Stuff about the virus?He nods.Yeah, mostly.He looks at me, onion hanging out of his mouth.You know what the weird thing is, though?I shake my head.No.The weird thing...He leans in.The weird thing is?It was our data in the first place.What?I think its what they took from Apple Pi.Our notes, our experiments.They were having us deconstruct it for them.Hold on, I say.You were explaining it for those guards?No, he says, screwing his face up.Not them.They had these other people.Trained people.Theyd come to us every few days.In between, we were expected to review what had been assigned to us and prepare notes.Why dump you out in the open like that, though?He shrugs.I have no idea.After they first took us from Apple Pi, they put us in a school.Wed sit in the classrooms all day and work, like we were students, ya know, from before Maenad.But ...I heard one of the guards say that it was too hard to keep a close watch on us there.The story went around that someoneI dont know whohad gotten free and hid away from them.So they moved you somewhere that couldnt happen.He shrugs again.They moved us.Did they...I pause.Did they hurt you?He pauses, mid chew, and looks down.Sometimes.He shrugs.We tried to figure out how to avoid it.What to say.He looks back up at me.I even made a chart.A chart?Yes, he says.Of what set them off.What led to their punishments, each time it happened.He looks down again.It didnt help.His voice is low and strangled.I reach for another question, something to divert him away from the current topic of conversation.What about the new boffins?I ask.They okay?He shrugs.They seem just fine.We were all in there together.All tormented together.His eyes seem haunted, looking off in the middle distance.Then they snap back and he returns to his food.Yeah, Hector and Maya.They seem smart.I remember both of them from when we rescued them from the prison camp.Hector is tall and thin, with a receding hairline and grey at his temples.Maya is short and slight, with a long, dark ponytail and, oddly, silver hoops in her ears.Large ones.Its not something I see very often.I decide to seek out the new boffins and introduce myself to them.Thank you so much for getting us out, Hector says.You didnt have to.You dont know us.I wasnt going to leave you behind, I say.And the other boffins vouch for you.Boffins?Maya asks.Sorry.Its a word I use for Mirandas people.Miranda, Maya says.We heard a lot about her in the camp.Yeah, I say.Shes like the unofficial leader of this group.Shes the one who brought them all together to work on a cure.You havent met her yet?No, Hector says.She seems busy.Cmon, I say.Let me introduce you.So I bring them over to Miranda, who has been smiling all night.Which causes this swelling and warmth inside my chest.That I could help bring her people back makes me feel good.That it makes her happy makes me feel better.But I still dont know what those feelings meanto her, to me, to anyone.Hi, Ben, Miranda says.Her skin is slightly flushed from the hooch.Miranda, I say, I wanted to introduce you to Hector and Maya.Miranda smiles and puts out her hand.Oh, yes.Ive heard a lot about you.Maya shakes it first, then Hector.Im so glad to meet you.Im happy that Ben was able to get you out.Were grateful to be out, Maya says.We wanted to ask ...I mean ...were not sure what you want to do with us.Do you need us to leave?Do you want to leave?Miranda asks.Actually, Hector says, weve been talking about it and we thought ...I mean if you didnt mind ...we were thinking Wed love to stay if we could, Maya interrupts.Miranda smiles at her.The way I hear it, you two would fit in nicely around here.The smile fades.And were still short some people.Besides, I dont even know if they would let you off the island at this point.Theyre pretty protective about the location.Thats okay with me, Maya says.It looks like you have access to food and shelter.And places to bathe.Mirandas smile returns.That wont be a problem at all.Great, Hector says.The others ...they told us about your work on a cure.Id ...Id like to help.Good, Miranda says.Then its settled.Well start in the morning.Maya and Hector move off, and Miranda looks over to me.Her eyes are shining.Or maybe glassy.Thank you, she says.Thank you for getting them out.I nod.I needed to do it.She puts a hand on my cheek.Then she leans in and kisses me.Its the first time weve done this in front of other people.I kiss her back.As we pull apart, I catch Clay at the other end of the room, scowling at me.Then another boffin comes up to Miranda and she turns to talk to her.Sergei finds me a little while later.It is good, Ben, he says.What is?This, he says.All of this.Our people.Miranda.Im guessing Sergei is a little drunk.Hes staring at Miranda.You know shes like a daughter to me, yes?Of course, I say.And I love her like one.His eyes move to me.Like my own.He smiles, then it fades.I knew her parents.I promised them.He grabs my shoulder, leans in a little too close.I promised them.Leave it to the boffinsall logic while sober, all maudlin while drunk.I look at Sergei and see tears in his eyes.It unnerves me.I turn to go.Sergeis hand claps down hard on my shoulder.Pulls me back around.You, he says.His voice is a little too loud.A little too emphatic.You do a good job of protecting her.I try, I say.And you make her happy.Are you sure?I ask.I am.He pats me again.Ben ...you should ...I mean, you...Sergei...He shakes his head.You shouldnt let this slip away, you hear?Okay, Sergei.No, he says.No.I had someonelong ago.He shakes his head again.I let it just ...slip away.He mimes opening his hands, gives a little smile.Then his face turns serious.I never forgave myself.Dont do that, okay?Okay, I say.Promise me, he says.Sergei, its okay.He places his hand on my cheek.Promise.Me.Fine.I promise.Good, he says, the smile returning.Good.Then he stumbles off.I catch Mirandas eye from across the room.She is happy, smiling.Gorgeous.Shining.Part of me wants to walk across the room, pull her to me, and kiss her.But now doesnt really seem like the time.Still, it feels like a perfect night.Then I catch sight of Rosie glaring at me, too.Well, almost perfect.The next day, Lewis shows up to meet everyone and get a sense of the operation.Also to establish his authority.Im not really part of either.I want to stay here with Miranda, of course, but theres not much for me to do here.I crave the activity of the main island.And as long as Alpha is here, Ill never feel comfortable.Miranda is busy with the boffins, sharing the new data she stole from the Cabal, giving them their assignments, answering questions.I wander for a bit, walking the edge of the island, and then I find myself back in the boffins area.Theyre going to need new buildings out here, I think.If everyone is going to stay.The newcomers need a place to sleep.Right now theyre all huddled in the largest room in the place.Last night they basically passed out in any space they could.And theyre going to need more room for their experiments.Were going to have to talk to Lewis about a long term solution.Somehow, as Im wandering, I find myself at Alphas enclosure.Its kept away from the main work area.Hes in a cage in a building with another layer of fencing around.Miranda explained to me their security measures.Even I had to admit they sounded pretty thorough.And they damn well better be.Because theyre keeping a live Feral here.And if he were to escape, well, who knows what might happen?Which is why Tamoanchan has been insisting on everyone staying out here.Heading back to the island would mean another quarantine period before I could do anything.Then, for reasons even Im not sure of, I go inside to look at Alpha, careful to deactivate all the security measures in place, making sure I reactivate them as I pass.This is nothing new to me.My father taught me you dont take chances with Ferals, and Im proud to say I never have.Well, except letting this one fly with me.But that was Mirandas idea and it wasnt my ship, so I didnt have a whole lot of say in the matter.Alpha looks a lot like the last time I saw him.His hair is still long and tangled, but he looks a little cleaner.I wonder if that was the boffins.Taking blood samples might be a lot easier without a layer of dirt and shit and matted hair.Miranda has access to some tranquilizers.and theyve rigged a system where they can easily administer injections if necessary.They might have knocked him out and scrubbed him down.The idea almost makes me vomit.Too easy for his contaminated fluids to get on someone that way unless you were covered head to toe.Ill have to ask Miranda.But hes pacing when I walk in, until he sees me and launches himself at the bars of his cage, shrieking, challenging.If he could, hed be on top of me in an instant, his teeth on my neck or some other place where they might be able to kill.Hed let me die and then tear into me with hands that might have once held a spoon or fork, with a mouth that might have once been capable of speech.No longer.Once again, I feel the urge to pull out the revolver and splatter his brains on the other side of his cage.But I dont.I promised Miranda I wouldnt.But I keep hoping for a reason that we dont need to keep this thing.A reason to dispose of him, drop him in the ocean and let the creatures there rid the world of his threat forever.But not today.I double check the security as I leave.Okay, triple check it.I mean, fucking Ferals.When I get back to the lab, Miranda is waiting for me.You okay?she asks.I nod.Yeah.Fine.She looks at me, doubtful.Im fine.She shrugs.Okay.What did Lewis want?What doesnt he want?she says.I had to give him a breakdown of what were planning.What we need.What were going to do with it all.Was he satisfied?She tucks some loose hair behind her ear.I dont know.I think so.But we need a lot.We have the mind power now, but we need supplies.Glassware, chemicals, hardware ....more.Lewis ...I dont know that he liked all of that.I nod.Hes going to need to organize ship captains to go forage, give them lists, teach them what to look for.I guess, she says.Up until now, this plan of Mirandas has seemed nebulousboffin stuff, science, nothing to do with mebut right here I see a piece of the puzzle that makes sense to me.Let me do it.What?I feel something, a slight burning in my belly, a fire rekindled.Let me go deal with it.Ill talk to Lewis.Help arrange the ships.Help get you your supplies.She looks up at me, unsure.This is what Im good at, Miranda, I say.I fly ships.I forage.I dont know all of what you need, but I can figure out a way to get it.Ben Its what Im good at, I repeat.Along with pissing people off, getting thrown in cells, getting beat on...She ticks them off on her fingers.Im a decent pilot, too.She sighs.I know.She crosses her arms.Its not a bad idea.Then why not let me do that?She meets my eyes.I thought that you were going to stick around this time.I look away.I cant do anything for you here.In her eyes, a challenge.I keep talking.I know ships.I know captains.I know foraging.Can you really trust anyone else?She sighs again.No.Okay, then.Ill do it.Ill go to the main island and talk to Lewis and start finding ship captains.What are you going to fly, Ben?I shrug.I dont know.Maybe Ill fly with someone else.Maybe Ill convince Diego to take the Osprey.And Rosie?I dont know, Miranda.I need to figure it out.Okay.Okay?Yes, she says.Youre really the only person I would trust.And Im the best person for the job.She just shakes her head.Go on.Say it.Say Im the best person for the job.Sometimes it surprises me that youve survived this long.I smile at her.This will work.Ill need to give you a list of what we need.Yes, I say.Please do.I can figure out some of it, but not the ...science stuff.Miranda shakes her head.Ill take care of the science stuff.She pushes a strand of hair out of her face.I dont expect that Lewis will like this much, but ...hes in this up to his ears.He lives or dies with us, and for us to live, we need everything.Im polling my people to see if they know of any caches or intact research locations.Well need to get as much as we can.Whatever you need, I say.She tilts her head at me.You kinda like all this jumping around, dont you?Youve never been in one place for very long.I open my mouth.The Cherub doesnt count, she interrupts.Then no.She chews on her bottom lip.Do you think you could ever get used to this island living?I inhale slowly and consider my next words.Its been something Ive been thinking about for a little while now.I guess ever since the Cherub blew up.Will I ever be happy in one place?Will I ever be happy on the ground?I dont know, I say.I think maybe.With you, I want to say.But the words wont come out.But Ill always need the sky, I say.Ive been thinking that if they wont give me the Dumah, then maybe Ill see if I can get work aboard another ship.At least until I can figure something else out.I think if I can fly from time to time Ill be okay.Well, then its a good thing you get to go back to it.Yeah...Get me your list, I say.We dont have a lot to barter with, but Ill see if Lewis can help.Maybe Diego, too.She nods, then looks at me, something unspoken in her eyes.Try not to get yourself banged up this time, she says.I wont be there to patch you up.Noted, I say.Good bye, Ben.As I turn to go, I think about how I dont like the sound of that.SIXTEEN Three weeks of supply runs, back and forth to Tamoanchan, and Im finally on the last one.It quickly became obvious that it didnt make sense to stop for quarantine, so its been grab and drop, grab and drop, grab and fucking drop.Unsurprisingly, Im having a great time.Its not the same as being on the Cherub, of course, and Im not the pilot, but Diego lets me take the Ospreys controls from time to time, and Im back in the air.Back to foraging.Back to my old life.The only difference is that Ive never really worked with a crew before, unless you count Claudia and my dad.For this last run, its Diego, Rosie, and meas usualand Maya, one of the new boffins we rescued from the prison camp.Miranda had the bright idea of sending a boffin along on each of the runs, to help identify what supplies were most needed and to help with some of the delicate equipment, which was a good idea.Me, I dont know a microscope from a spectroscope from a tele ...wait, I know a telescope.You know what I mean.So they didnt lose too much brainpower, they stuck to the same people, but for this last run, they sent along Maya.Mayas hoop earrings continue to throw me.I mean, why would you wear something like that?Theyd be too likely to get stuck on something.Like a Ferals finger.I picture it in my head, the skin tearing, an open wound just exposed, waiting to be infected.I cant suppress my shudder.Shes at least wearing a hat, a wide brimmed, light colored affair, and a colored scarf that wraps about her neck and can be pulled up to cover her face.Otherwise, her small form is fairly decently wrapped in sweaters and a worn in pair of jeans.Most of what shes wearing is knitted.By the look of her eyes, shes got some Asian blood in her, but other blood, too.She catches me looking at her and smiles.I hope she doesnt get the wrong idea.So tell me again what this thing is?I ask.Its a cache of gear and supplies, she says.We had a pretty steady operation, Hector and me and the others, but we had backup supplies.In case of disaster.Or theft.Or attack.So we decided to stash some equipment in a safe place.And this could help Miranda.Definitely.We bring that back, and it will be a huge help.If you say so.Thing is, she says, leaning back against the wall of the gondola, the more machines we have to run these tests, the better.You need backups.You need contingency plans.As it is, were going to have to have people staffing the lab on a continuous basis.Or at least every time someone arrives back on the island.Which, sure, would be great.This has been something weve been working toward for a long time.Being able to keep the virus off of the island would be a huge, positive change for everyone.But its not foolproof.I mean, you can limit infection, but new people are always going to be tricky.They got lucky with me and Miranda.But its still a perilous thing.Bring in a new airship crew, for example, to help bring in supplies.And if you cant trust them, if they turn on you and sell you out to someone, then what?All it takes is one person to do something like that.Protecting against that is much harder.Which makes me wonder about Maya.I wouldnt rush to let someone like her off the island so soon after getting there, but it had nothing to do with me.Miranda put her on the list and Lewis cleared it.She was offering Miranda a prize, after all, another cache of supplies.And, like the other boffins, she seems more excited by the project theyre working on than anything else.Sounds like her previous group was pretty severely taken apart by the raiders.It still seems so strange.I can see why raiders would want to go after someplace like Gastown.Its valuable.It has helium.Plus, its a center of trade.They hold it, they get to reap the rewards.But boffin setups?All Ive been able to figure is that the Cabal wants to stop others from studying the Bug.They want to be the only game in town.Or maybe they just want to steal what everyone else has managed to figure out.I dont know.But their involvement in everything makes me uneasy.The Valhallans, I can try to understand.Theyre about power, pure and simple.The Cabal ...Im lost without a map.So, are you going to try to patch up this thing between you and Rosie?Maya asks me, interrupting my train of thought.It surprises me at first, but then she and Rosie have become quite chummy.I think its up to her, I say.Shes mad at me for putting Diego in danger.But didnt you?I shift in my seat.Yes.And Ive apologized to him.She crosses her arms.But have you apologized to her?To Rosie?She nods....no.So you really havent tried to fix this.She thinks Im bad weather.And besides, what happened happened.I cant take it back.You could show remorse.I have.I do.I Shit.Is she right?Do you think I should?Maya shrugs.It seems like it might be a good idea.She shrugs again.Or maybe shell get over it on her own.Im tired of talking about this, so I try to shift the conversation.So how long have you and Hector been working together?Years, now, she says.He came from out East.
