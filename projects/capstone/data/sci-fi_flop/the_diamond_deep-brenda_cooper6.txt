Can you talk to Aleesi?Naveen asked.No.We used Ix for that.But what about when you left?Naveen was looking at Onor.Aleesi wrote on your journal.I think she was still using Ix to help her.It was still doing basic care at that point.I think so, too.Ruby looked thoughtful.Is whatever communication we do have here enough to talk to her?I tried every day for a week after we first got settled, but nothing happened.She hasnt looked alive, although Im sure she is alive.Its possible.Aleesi is not our tech, but she is probably more like our current tech than Ix.Will you help us try?I can.Will you protect Aleesi while you do it?I dont want any footage of this, and I dont want her hurt.I stripped her of her defenses, I took her from her sister copies, and I brought her here, to a place she is afraid of.Yes.Can we try now?Naveen laughed.I need to do some research.And carefully.If I help you with this, and if I get caught, I could be in real trouble.So could you.So why are you willing to help?Joel asked.Why take the risk?Because I can make a lot of credit when Ruby does a tour of the ship.When Ruby what?Joels voice sounded barely controlled.Shes already popular.You saw what I gave to Onor.That was a tenth of what I owe you.He smiled.At least if you consider this an agent relationship.I can set up the venues, I can generate interest.You cant.You dont know enough.Ruby looked thoughtful, Joel looked downright opposed even though he didnt respond.Naveen continued.Look, Ill do it for just a year.Ill write the contract so you can get out of it.Its a win for both of us.And you need a friend here.Onor froze as he realized Ruby, Joel, and Haric were all looking at him, as if waiting for him to decide.He did know Naveen better than they did.At a gut level, he trusted him and didnt trust him all once.He glanced at Ix, captured in a silver ball on the table, and remembered how the AI had helped them win a different fight.He took a deep breath.I trust him.We will think about it, Joel said.Naveen stood.Thank you.Ill be back within a week.After Naveen left, Joel picked up the ball of Ix and stared at it.How do we even know this is Ix, and that it hasnt been changed in some horrible way?47     Ruby stood in line and watched a man who could hire her people as surreptitiously as she could manage.After failing for three days, she had spoken to Lake and requested his help.Shed learned that this man was a longshoreman from The Great Bastard, a ferry that had come up from Lym carrying clothes, food, and livestock.It had been unloaded, and now it waited for precious metals mined from the asteroid belt out beyond the orbit of the Diamond Deep.That was work that didnt need the ability to interface with the Diamond Deeps systems.Her people had a prayer of doing it.She studied the man.Tall.Deeply muscled for a spacer, his biceps surely a result of long days of heavy labor.Paintings of trees covered his body, each leg a forest, his arms turned to branches carrying blue birds hidden amongst fall foliage.Beside her, Haric tried to stand as tall as he could.She had spent precious credit to bring Conroy as well, as an example of the strongest men from the Fire.Not that Conroy had any size compared to the tree man.He was big if Onor stood next to him, or Haric, or Ruby.But Conroy to the longshoreman was like Haric to Conroy.She watched him accept three workers and reject two.Not horrid odds, but not great.When he gestured them forward Ruby had to look up to meet his eyes.We are from the interstellar ship that just came back.We have many excellent workers, and we would love a chance to help you.He smiled, and for a moment she felt hope.I am looking for experience.She swallowed.How will we get experience if no one teaches us?How will I get my ship unloaded with people who know nothing?He started to wave them away.Take two of us.Thats all.They can teach the others.He crossed his arms over his chest, the tattoos of leaves and birds rippling as he moved.Ill take you.Before she could accept, Haric put a hand on her arm.She remembered her promises to Joel.Take me and Conroy.She pointed at Conroy.He laughed.I dont need strength, I need experience.Now get out of the way.She stepped aside.They stood against a wall and watched at the man hired the next two people in line and then dismissed the line.So close.Its almost as if were being blackballed, Conroy mused.What?Haric asked.As is someone has told them not to hire us.I hope not, Ruby mused.Would Koren go that far?Now what?Haric asked.We keep trying.Most of the people who can hire us have already gone for the morning.So what?If we dont start finding work, well starve.We have people who worked on the gardens on the Fire.Lets find a place for them.Surely thats not skilled labor.Ruby sat in the small kitchen with SueAnne beside her.SueAnne sat in the same wheeled chair, which shed taken to using most of the time.Her fingers worked, twisting colorful cloth to make belts.The fabric was one of the few purchases Ruby had allowed; enough bright colors to help them fit into the vibrant chaos that was the station.Almost everything they had brought from the Fire was somber and faded.They had to look better to get hired.Five of the whispering women sat outside the door, singing softly.Not one of Rubys songs.At least their voices werent bad.Ruby stared at the figures on her slate.She had been able to place five people into a harvesting crew.Five out of thousands.Harvesting paid five credits a day; grunt work at best.KJ had done slightly better, but at a cost.Five of his dancers had signed on to be bodyguards for dignitaries; theyd demonstrated they could take down attackers in unique ways.They earned more.Fifteen credits a day.But KJ had offered to let them keep five each.It wasnt what she wanted.She wanted all of the credit to come to a single place and be spread back out, so everyone could protect everyone else.KJ was trying to protect his own.She understood; so was she.She had just thought she and KJ were on the same page until she learned they werent.Even thinking about it made her stiffen.When shed brought it up to Joel, hed given her a look of mild curiosity and asked if she wanted to lose the protection KJs dancers offered her people.At least they were discreet.She had set up a system that recorded the credits they had banked in days of life for the whole population of Ash.She used a paltry three credits a day: air, water, and food plus a bit that she could dole out for transportation or to replace a broken slate.Theyd lost almost a full day for every day theyd been here.Unacceptable.She sighed and sat back, catching SueAnnes attention.We have to do a hundred times better.Even if we learn how to use the Exchange as well as possible, if we get a quarter of the jobs available, it wont be enough.There are other Exchanges.I dont want to split us up.Or give up control, SueAnne observed.You cannot do everything, be everywhere.You will kill us all if you try.The job is too big for you.Im not the only one!KJ is placing people.Haric is going out without me tomorrow, trying to find a cheaper way to buy food.Allen is looking for material to open a real bar, and bargaining with our own people for space.SueAnne plopped a glass of water down in front of Ruby.Drink.Unlimited water is built into the base credit.Go take a shower and revel in it.Write a song.This is not like you.Outside the door, the women stopped singing for a moment, the quiet noticeable.They started a chant.She hadnt finished a new song since they left the Fire.There hadnt been time.She had a long list of ideas and scraps of lyrics in her slate: when she thought of anythingeven in the middle of a meetingshe jotted it down.I have to finish adding up all the numbers.No you dont.Youre obsessing about them.Besides, theyre actually pretty simple.Ill take over the accounting and give you a report every day.Really?An old womans got to have a way to be useful.Ruby hesitated, but the offer was good.Maybe SueAnne was right, and she had let herself get too tired to be grateful for help.Okay.She drank the water.Thank you.It will help.Can I show you what Ive done?Youve already shown me.SueAnne held the half finished belt up in front of her and squinted at it.Twice Okay.Go, SueAnne said, her fingers tugging and pulling at some of the thin colorful ropes to make them more even.Damn, its hard to make this thing lie flat.Go where?Sleep, and take a shower.Rest.Clean up.I have to go back to the Exchange.I want to talk to Lake.Hell tell me how to do better there.SueAnne gave her a long, measured look.Then you had best rest and clean up, and put on something pretty.If you find me in a few hours, Ill be done with this belt.You can wear it.Ruby trailed her fingers along the old womans shoulders.I didnt used to like you.But sometimes its all right to be told a few things.SueAnne didnt let Ruby see her face, but she reached up and took her hand for just a second.The new belt fit well.Shed thought it might be small, but it wasnt.She should remember to eat more often.Ani and Jaliet sat next to her on the train to Exchange Five.What if Lake wont help us?Ani asked.Then well find someone who will.We just need to learn enough to help ourselves.You havent heard from Naveen?No.She was beginning to wonder if Naveen really would help them with the AIs, or if hed decided they were a lost cause.Or maybe he was just busy selling her songs.She wanted to know that, too.Maybe there was another day or two of life in that.The three of them stepped off the train and Ruby watched Anis face.It was the first time shed been to the Exchange, and the look of sheer wonder in her eyes rewarded Ruby for bringing her.Im so impressed, Ani said.She fingered the bright colored ribbons Jali had braided into her three braids.I see why it mattered what we looked like.Peoples colorful clothes varied in a hundred different ways.Shorts and boots and dresses and simple wraps and work uniforms eerily reminiscent of the Fires work jumpsuits.Multicolored skin abounded, including blues and reds and purples and stripes and other designs.Even though Ruby had been here every day since Koren first brought them, it always shocked her system to see the variety of humans and robots.Vendors called from booths, advertisements broadcast from invisible speakers, people chattered in numerous dialects.Come on, I sent Lake a note to meet us in a little cafe I like.Ani frowned.Whats a cafe?A galley, only its not free.Youre going to let us spend credit?Ani asked.Only a little.Order lightly.Yes, oh obsessed one, Ani said.Jali frowned at Ani but said nothing.Ruby managed to get both of their attention for a moment.I dont know how much I trust Lake.But he claims his job is to help put people who need work in touch with people who need workers.Hes been nice so far, and some of his ideas have helped.Some havent.Look at that!Jali pointed at a girl weaving through the crowds on a board with wheels.Ruby glanced at the skater, wishing she had that much freedom in this unfamiliar place.She turned back to the task at hand.We have to do better.I have Haric and KJ both looking for manual labor, but there must be other ways to earn credit.I want your eyes and ears.Lake stood outside the cafe, waiting for them.The last time shed seen him, hed been in reds.This time he had chosen a set of browns almost like Naveens usual colors, although in Lakes case they were splashed with bright red flowers and orange birds the color of his long ponytail.Good afternoon, Ruby the Red.Welcome, welcome.If he noticed the shocked look on Anis face or the curiosity on Jaliets, he didnt react.Im Lake.And you are?They made it through Anis stammered introduction, and Jalis cool one, and ended up at a very nice table under a tree with a pitcher of iced water, an orange pot full of tea, and a small platter of little cakes.Im happy to see that you came to ask me for additional help.Im sorry my lead about The Great Bastard didnt work out, but there are others brokering work.He held a small cup in a large hand, took a small sip, smiling.It would be easier to find room for more bodyguards.We have thousands of people.Only a few can do that job.There is a large ship, The Ladys Love, coming in from Mammot in a few days.I will be talking to the crew bosses there.Jali asked, And that work will be?The usual.Unloading.Jali sipped at her tea and looked only the slightest bit interested.And how many jobs might be available for a group such as ours?Maybe twenty.Maybe a few more.That would pay ...?Ruby asked.I dont set the price.Probably five credits a day.So little.Ruby sighed.She looked over at Ani, who held her own cup but didnt drink the tea.She seemed entranced by the others in the cafe, slightly shell shocked.But then Ruby remembered how exhausted she had been the first day she came here.She leaned over and whispered in Anis ear.Drink water.Jali spoke to Lake, And in trade for that, you would like to have?There are many things I would like.Credit eases a mans way, but it is very traceable.What might you have to offer?Ruby answered.We have people who can count and keep inventory.We have trained robot repair crews.We have others who know how to keep bar, or to make still.Lake set his cup down carefully.You know how to repair our robots?We can learn.I did the job myself, once.And your hands are entirely too pretty, and your voice worth too much for such a thing.He leaned back, his look measuring.I can arrange almost anything if you can help me do so.Ruby went cold.No wonder she hadnt had any success, no wonder Lake had given her certain looks from time to time, as if waiting for her to say ritual words.He wanted a bribe.How could she have been so nave?She bit her tongue, and blessed Jali for saying, We do not have spare credit to help you in a meaningful way.Perhaps we will be able to provide assistance in some other way?There are many forms of commerce of a station this size.Your people aresomewhat unique in how original you are.What do you mean?Ruby asked.You have a following now.Naveen has stirred up interest.There will be people who would like to sit across a table from youlike I am nowbut who will be unable to do so.There may be other ways to satisfy their appetites.Perhaps you have a few young girls who are looking for opportunities to serve as companions?Before Ruby could react, Jali spoke again.We do not participate in that trade.What else might help you plead our case convincingly?Lake looked at Ruby, his eyes as warm and friendly as they had always been, as if what she had just heard him say changed nothing.Sometimes I am allowed to organize events here.Perhaps I can work with your manager to put on a concert, and you can pay me well enough that it covers my time to sell tickets.Ruby swallowed, still furious and slightly confused.Once more, Jaliet saved her.Naveen may contact you in a few days.In the meantime, please consider us when The Ladys Love arrives.Surely you are also rewarded by the crew who are able to find the right workers.Lake shook his head.More people need ways to earn credit than there are opportunities.Ruby had read him completely wrong and wasted days.But she also did not want him as an enemy.Lake stood and gave them a slight bow.Keep me in mind if you need anything.Ani watched him leave.How are we going to learn everything we need to learn?Jali laughed.One step at a time.She turned to Ruby.He will need to be paid to help us.And I suspect his appetite is not small.I suppose he helped us get a few jobs to demonstrate that he could, and then made sure we missed on others to show his power?Jali shrugged.Hes looking out for himself.We all are, Ruby said.Weve got to figure out the systems, Jali said.We need something like Ix.Ruby hadnt told her about Ix, or about the idea that they may be able to load Ix into Aleesi.She didnt like the idea.But it would be better than selling their children.She still remembered her friend Nona, who had been murdered while selling herself to a red.That past had seemed dim, but now it felt real again and almost immediate, Nonas bloody face close in her memory.She couldnt let those days return.We need a safety net.Naveen wants you to tour, Jali said.We need more than me.Jali stood up.No.But if you werent here, what would we have?Well work on getting skills for everyone else, and learning how to trade.But that will take time.Fox would have taken this opportunity, and we should learn from what he did for us.Ruby let out a long sigh.We need to find a better power position.Jali said, We are weak as newborns here.I bet Lake is five hundred years old, and knows how to con anybody under a hundred without even thinking about it.Ruby picked up a small pink cake and took a bite.I suspect were buying this food.We might as well eat it.48     Onor sat beside Naveen and stared into his cup of water, wishing it were something stronger.On his other side, Ruby fidgeted with her cup, twisting it round and round and periodically clinking the edge on the table.Joel, KJ, and SueAnne filled the rest of the chairs.Everyone seemed to be avoiding everyone elses eyes.Onor worried.Rubys cheeks were stained by dark circles and her hair hung limply down her side.She looked thinner.She needed rest, and sleep, and to relax.The hand that wasnt working the cup in circles fingered the beads around her neck, one of the old ones from the days before the real fighting on the ship.It looked out of place here, hand made and childish.SueAnne and Ruby had been spending more time together.SueAnne whispered to her, You must prioritize.Ruby glanced at Joel, who had the common sense to remain quiet.Lately, Onor had heard tension between them.Three long weeks of going only backward was wearing on them all.Today, no one had found work.Naveen had shown up with a few thousand earned credits for them, but still they were two days further behind for the week.Ruby had taken to beating herself with that number.Ruby sat up straighter and looked at Naveen.Will you do everything you can to protect Aleesi?Yes.She kept looking at him, intense.Can I trust you?She looked around at the whole table, Naveen following her gaze.Can we all trust you?I will do my best to put Ix into Aleesi and leave her whole.But I will prioritize Ix.You need that worse.The community will need an AI while we tour.Youll do it here.Ruby said.I dont want her out of our sight.I will, Ruby the Demanding Red, I will.Naveens laughter and Rubys choice seemed to release them all from the tension that had filled the room just a moment before.SueAnne rose to pour more water.Joel smiled at Naveen; the first thing Onor had seen between the two men that was better than truce since they were kicked off the Fire.How long do you need?Ruby asked.Naveen shrugged.A few hours.Maybe a little more.Ruby gave out a weak smile.When should I plan to leave?A week.Ruby shook her head.Two weeks.I need to write some songs for here.And I want you to take me out for two days.I want to see more places so I can learn more.Joel tensed.Ruby must have sensed it in him.Not just me.Joel and Onor and KJ, too.At least.Naveen frowned.It would be better to leave sooner.A week and a half, then.A week and a half after you get Ix working.A week and a half from now, Naveen insisted.Timing is important.We can stop along the way, during the tour.I want to see whats good about the Deep.And I want to see the Brawl for myself.You cant possible show me everything, but you can pick the absolute best and the absolute worst.We arent allowed anywhere near the best, Naveen said.We arent really even supposed to know the best that exists here.They hide their excesses from us.Ruby smiled at Naveen, that quirky, you didnt understand smile of hers that Onor had always loved.I did not say the richest and the poorest.I said the best and the worst.Another way to think of it is as the cruelest and the kindest.A core lesson from our history on the Fire is that those in power are often both as good and as bad as those out of it.She shared a glance with Joel where whatever they saw in each others eyes softened them both.When they left the room, they had to push through the whispering women.Lya was there, her eyes fastened on Ruby as if she hungered for something.Maybe Rubys beauty, or her power.Not the revenge Lya had once wanted; something in her desires had changed, become greater than anger or hatred.Perhaps it was sorrow, but it felt like there was some other purpose to it as well, but one that Onor couldnt quite grasp.Whatever it was, the whispering women made it hard to guard Joel and Ruby.Onor had to assume the women could have weapons, even though so far they hadnt shown up with so much as a thick pipe disguised as a walking stick.Onor found the whole situation inexplicable, both why Lya followed Ruby around, and why Ruby allowed it.Joel didnt appear to understand it any more than Onor.Hed made a few off hand comments that showed he was more frustrated with the women than Onor was, and a few times he had worn such contempt and anger on his face that Onor almost felt sorry for Lya.The whispering women had traded for or made more and more white clothing over time, so now they looked like pale ghosts.It almost seemed that as Ruby and the others began dressing more and more like the bright inhabitants of the Diamond Deep, Lya and her women fought to be everything the station was not.SueAnne and Naveen waited with Onor for the entire entourage of the colorful and the white to disappear around a corner.SueAnne was using her chair today, rolling back and forth in an odd imitation of pacing the corridor.I dont envy Ruby, SueAnne muttered as if she were talking to no one.Because of those women or because she carries so much on her shoulders?Naveen asked.Both.Shes strong, Naveen said.Look more closely, SueAnne warned Naveen.Shes exhausted.Ill make sure she rests.You may not have that much power, Onor cautioned.He frowned at the now empty corridor.Look, I promised someone Id have lunch with her.Naveen?Can you eat with SueAnne?Ill meet you back in the main galley.Of course.He found Marcelle in her office, a small square box with a depressing little black desk and small chair.A sign on the front of her desk proclaimed Marcelle Director of Education.She looked up when he entered.Her face was streaked with tears.What happened?Two of the babies died.Shed been sneaking into the creche at night and refusing to tell Ruby.He slid around the desk and she stood so that he could fold her into his arms.It was becoming more natural to hold her, to feel her thin frame against his, to have his cheek and nose tickled by her curly hair.Im so sorry.They didnt do anything.We brought them here, and they died.I know.He rubbed her back, his fingers feeling big against her.She was losing muscle.You need to eat more.She didnt respond to that.I expected to lose Aaron.But I was surprised to lose Pia.I thought she was getting better.How many are still sick?he whispered.How much worse might it get?Her tears took her over and he dug around for a handkerchief and wiped her cheek dry over and over.Only five.She struggled to get her breath.We sent three home yesterday.So it might be okay?It might just be what Koren said, that some of us are allergic to the new things in the food and the air here.Its only babies and the old, Marcelle said.At least thats all that stays sick.She sank into him again, letting a few beats of silence go, stiffening while the time went.I get so mad.I cant help myself.Im sure they could help them if they wanted.Or we could find a way to get help.There is no single they here, he murmured.It worked for us to think like that on the Fire.But here?Here there are a hundred theys.Maybe more.We have to get the attention of people we think can help us, and we have to convince them to help us.Surely there are people here who could have stopped the babies from dying.Everything here costs credit.What does a life cost?He couldnt bring himself to tell her that hed asked Naveen about how to get medical care.Naveen had asked for how many, and then told him what it would cost to buy the services of a specialist doctorhuman or robot.They had their own medical care from the Fire, of course.But they knew the diseases of a ship, the angsts and sores and cuts and sorrows of a contained colony.To buy more expertise would cost them all.A few days of life for the whole colony against a chancenot even a known outcomefor a few children.He had reported the information to Ruby and Joel and SueAnne and watched them decide to use hope instead of credit.It had been hard to watch; another decision between bad and awful, between hopeless and barely hopeful.Well find a way.Really, we will.There has to be way.The choices here were far more cruel than the choices aboard the Fire had been.At best, they would survive their own choices with their hearts intact.He held Marcelle a little tighter.Onor, Ruby, and KJ were alone with Naveen in Ruby and Joels living room, staring at the blue pill shaped heart of Aleesi.The round ball of Ix lay beside the webling that held Aleesis brain.Both looked too small for the beings that inhabited them.KJ looked alert and rested, like he always did.In contrast, Rubys shoulders still drooped with exhaustion and the dark circles under her eyes had barely faded.She leaned in over the objects and whispered to Naveen, Do you think you did it?Do you think its okay?Naveen looked as serious as Onor had ever seen him.Hed chosen to change his myriad browns for somber blacks, as if demonstrating how earnestly he took her need to preserve Aleesi.He set a small speaker down on the table beside Aleesis brain, and his slate beside the speaker.I was able to move all that is Ixor all that I could tease apart from the ship when I copied itinto Aleesi.There was some space that she wasnt using, anyway.It wasnt enough to store or process all of Ix, so I deleted some of the very old parts to make room.Naveen must have felt Rubys frown.He grinned at her.She should be fine.In some ways it will have made her stronger.Did you talk to her?He shook his head.I waited for you.I ran tests on both of them, and they should both work.What about Ix?KJ asked.Did you change it, too?Ix will be different.It will retain most of its memories from the ship, but Ix knew itself as the ship, as all of the many myriad bits of data it collected.It knew itself as the cargo bays and the drive and the water systems and the recorder of trash.It probably experienced the ship as its body.KJ leaned in, his dark eyes narrowed.Will it work?I hope so.It appears the copy was crude, but true.AIs are like humans; they want to live, to continue.Naveen leaned forward and pushed a button on the small speaker.This will broker these conversations, keeping them off your community communication network.Thats for security.Will everyone be able to use Ix eventually?I dont know.We dont know what is safe.Ix was programmed to protect the Fire, not individual people.Ruby took the ball of Ix from the table and held it in her lap.Perhaps we can program it to protect us now?We are all it has left.Naveen picked up his slate and typed something.Im waking Ix up first.I will tell it who is here.The speakers were good, and the voice that came from them was clearer than it had ever been on the Fire.Hello, Ruby Martin.Ruby clasped her hands over her face and her eyes shone with unshed tears.Hello Ix.It is good to hear your voice.I cant feel anything.The voice didnt sound panicked at all.I remember coming in.The closer we came to the Diamond Deep, the more I had trouble thinking.Ruby and KJ exchanged a glance.Ruby spoke.You were limited, and copied.The you I am talking to now is a copy.We are no longer on the ship.We are in the station?Yes.There is me and Onor and KJ, and a man from the station named Naveen who has been trying to help you.Hello, Naveen.Naveen glanced around the room.Theres no point in keeping anything secret from it.Ruby said, You are ...you have been put into a small space.From one of the robot spiders.You remember the robot spiders?The invaders?Of course.Where is the Fire?Naveen held up a hand quickly, forestalling that answer.Yes, the invaders.I copied you into the brains of Aleesi, the one we saved.Thats where you are.With the being Aleesi?Yes.The voice was Aleesis though the speaker.I thought that might happen, Naveen muttered.Hello, Aleesi!Ruby said.Im glad to hear from you.I detect that I am different, Aleesi said.Naveen immediately asked, Better?Do you feel better?Different.Ruby licked her lips.I feel bad that we put Ix in with you.We didnt have a choice.She caressed the ball in her lap.We need Ix very badly.We need Ix to help protect us, who are all that is left of the Fire.Naveen looked unhappy with Ruby.I am used to sharing.Copies of my selves collected up from time to time and shared.Is the Fire gone?Ix asked.KJ spoke.Only in physical form.Its being scrapped.Ruby winced and added, We remain, and we are in a new place.Ash.Thats what you need to help us protect now.I still cannot feel anything.I cannot help if I cannot be connected.Naveen spoke to Ix.We will do that when we can.First we need to know that you can live where we placed you, and that you and Aleesi can share space.Of course we can, Aleesi said.But you have created more of an abomination to the station culture than I was by myself.You should understand the risks.There are risks to you, too, Ruby said.I have been dead since you caught me, Aleesi replied.KJ stared at Naveen.What is wrong with thisto the station culture?Aleesi is a human and Ix is an AI.Is that it?Aleesi answered before Naveen had a chance to.My very existence here is dangerous to you.The laws that made me illegal caused the Edge to flourish.Humans are not allowed to inhabit fully robotic bodies.The history is complex, but assume that this was seen to benefit both the AI community and humans.If Ix and I can share directly, it is a marriage of AI and human.That is also forbidden.No one spoke for a few moments.KJ recovered first.What will they do to us if they catch us?This time Naveen answered.We will see that that does not happen.KJs eyes narrowed in a way that made Onor glad the AIs had no visual receptors at the moment.Ruby, however, did have eyes.She looked at KJ as she spoke.We will be very careful.KJ whispered.Someday, one of your risks will kill us all.49     Ruby and Naveen and SueAnne stood at the window, looking down on the Brawl, SueAnnes chair parked behind her like a safety net.Rubys hands splayed across the cold glass, her face pressed to it.The Brawl looked ten times as crowded as they were, maybe twenty times.Bodies side by side, too close.Close enough to smell each other, to reach out and touch someone else easily in most directions most of the time.Lovers held each other, lying two to a one person cot.People gathered and talked or played games, usually with someone facing away from the group and watching, the way Onor and the other guards watched at concerts.Many people sat by themselves, or stood by themselves, surrounded by others but not touching or being touched by anyone else.Enforcer robots moved silently and efficiently through the crowd, which always seemed aware of them.This might be her peoples fate.There are no children, Ruby murmured.What would they do with our children?There are schools, Naveen said.We send the young children of people who end up here to boarding schools.SueAnne asked, Is it possible to visit people who are here?For a fee.Of course, Ruby replied, bitter.Angry.Everything is for a fee.What does it take to get out?SueAnne asked.It depends on why you are there.If its just for non payment of your life fee, then merely creditrepayment plus paying forward half a year.Thats a fortune.Family members have done it.Some that have skills can sign contracts for certain types of jobs and buy their freedom as long as they keep their contracts.So they have to do whatever the person who hires them tells them to do?For a year.The first six months pays their way out of here, the next pays forward enough that they have a year and a half before they would have to go back.Ruby remembered Lake, and choked out a question.Can women sell their bodies to get out of there?Naveens answer was, Sex is one of the most exquisite things people can sell here.Ruby shuddered.She looked down, searching for more details.No walls, no privacy.A few stacked blocks where people sat slightly above the crowd.Aisles snaked between groups.Here and there, benches and cots were fiercely protected.An exercise area was full of people and ringed with enforcer bots.Maybe those were the ones with the most will, staying as strong as they could.Youd have to be strong in a place like this.She hated it.Looking down at it didnt help her gain control of her dismay.There is enough food and space that everyone could live better than this.Ive seen it, already.You could take half the space thats in the Exchange, and still get the business of the Exchange done.That half could feed these people.If the people here have enough to live well and not work, they will do that.Such an experiment was carried out on another station, and the whole station became less competitive.So the idea of competition happened between stations as well.You competed, or you ended up here.Why else are people here, besides not paying?People who get caught breaking rules but who arent violent can be sent here.We have a lockup for big crimes, and banishment for others.They cant get out until their time is done, and they have to also make the life payment.He paused and they were all silent.She glanced away from the window to check Naveens expression.He looked closed.She stared back down at the crowded expanse, watching a man thread through the crowd while an enforcer followed him, like a slow dance.She couldnt quite tell if the man was being chased, but a way was opened for both, one at a time, as if the crowd below wanted the man to escape and yet couldnt block the enforcer.Its not pleasant, Naveen said quietly, but this system works.For each of the people you see down there, there are a hundred who are either pulling their weight and doing the work of the station, or earning credit with entertainmentlike me.Some are simply taken care of by others.You sound defensive.But you wanted us to see this.Not because the Brawl is a good place.Its not.Below her, the man seemed to be getting ahead of the enforcer.She felt puzzled.But you approve of it?It keeps civilization going.I dont approve.Here and there, she noticed the flickering lights of video screens.They have slates?Of course.And group entertainment.Ive even sold a few of your songs in to them.They like them.She stiffened against the glass, staring down at the people below, looking for the man who had been running from the enforcer.Sold?It some ways it was less horrible than she had imagined, in other ways it was more.She hated the idea of it, of segregating people and watching over them with machines.You sold my songs to people who have nothing?Of course.It is to help keep you from having nothing.Give them away here.All of them.Even the future ones.Naveen frowned.You have to have credit to make a difference.She ripped her attention from the window and turned to him, speaking too loudly for the small hallway and not caring.This is my work, not yours.I will have it given to these people.Naveen maintained his composure, although his jaw was set tight and his eyes looked harder and more determined than usual.And will you have it given to all of the downtrodden on the Diamond Deep?Are there worse places than this?Of course there are.The Brawl is one place we send our indigent.There are others, some for criminals or the incompetent.Here, people have food and air and entertainment.Some even choose to be here.After all, the rules are simple.Ruby frowned.You said people die here?Naveen looked slightly surprised at the question.They do.I showed this to you so that would understand Korens hope for you.So you would see what could befall you if you dont learn our ways fast enough.They needed this man.Ruby wanted to shout at him, to explore her rage at the whole idea of the Brawl, but it wouldnt help her people.Besides, Naveen didnt create the custom.She put her hands back on the glass to hide the way they had started shaking and looked out over the crowded living quarters below.For now, give them away here.I will think about other places later.Very well.Ruby found the man the enforcer had been following.He was on the ground, splayed, with one hand up as if in defense.The enforcer loomed over him, and he fell back, limp.There was no way to tell from here if he had been stunned or killed, but whatever had happened was cruel.She said nothing.SueAnne changed the subject.You mentioned that people choose to go here.Why?Survival means work.If you do work you like, or you do work well, survival on the Deep is good.The Deep has more opportunities than most other placesroom for more people who believe more things.Ive been to all the stations, and to Lym.Theyre all like thiscruel and hard on one end, and quite wonderful on the other.Im trying to show you the best and worst that could happen to you.50     Naveen, Allen, and Onor sat at one of the empty bar tables, a bottle that Naveen had brought in standing empty in the middle of the table, and another one half empty.Onor had taken to lifting the glass and letting the cool, slightly minty liquid touch his lips without actually drinking any more.Allen hadnt displayed the same self control; he listed in his chair.A bartender should know better.Naveen looked unaffected, although Onor had learned that he tended to look that way right up to the point that he could barely walk or speak.Well give you five percent.Naveen narrowed his eyes.I thought I was negotiating with Allen.Onor laughed, struggling to be as good natured as possible, to sound as nave as he could.Youre negotiating with the People of the Fire.Fancy name, Allen said.I like it.He burped.Go, Onor.Make a deal.Naveen looked slightly disgusted.I want ten percent.Ill be able to negotiate prices that are at least fifteen percent lower than you could get yourselves.You dont lose anything.Five percent on anything we sell here, to our people.Ten percent on anything we sell to people who come to us from the outside.Why would they do that?Naveen asked.We have bars.Because youre going to encourage people to come.Youll earn more credits from outsiders.Its going to be a great bar, Allen said, taking another drink.We know how to make good bars.He raised his drink.You said so yourself.Youll have to pay to transport the food and drink into here.Well split it with you?Onor said.Whos teaching you, anyway?Naveen grinned.Youre supposed to be nave.That could be true.Onor sat back and this time he took a more noticeable sip, the liquor warming his belly again.People would need to have some of the credit theyd earned to spend it here.Ruby would hate that.But the credit would stay inside of the community mostly, and maybejust maybethey could bring some in from outside.51     Jali stood beside Ruby, pinning up the shoulder of a pale gray dress shed decorated with red, blue, and gray beads unstrung from some of the many signal necklaces that Ruby had accumulated over time.The dress flowed all the way to the floor, and when she moved the beads clicked softly against each other.Just outside of the open door, but never coming in, three of the whispering women sat and watched.At least they were silent at the moment.Lya, an older woman named Justina, and Min, with her disfigured face.It hurt Ruby that Min had chosen to become a whispering woman; she remembered how proud she had been of the knife scar that marred her cheek, of fighting for freedom.What had made her choose to follow Lya?Ruby didnt say anything to her.She was developing a plan, but so far her plan didnt include engaging in conversation with her white shadows.The women acted like furniture.This bothered Ruby deeply, but they were creating the situation, not her.Forcing them away would only make matters worse.Ruby returned to admiring the dress, which fit snugly at the waist and flowed over her hips to end just at the floor in her bare feet.What did you make this one for?Ruby asked.Its beautiful, and soft, but its too heavy to perform in.Dinners, I suppose.Ive finished everything you need for performances.But there will be regular days, and important events you dont know about yet, and you will need to look your best for all of them.Ruby leaned in and gave Jali a slight hug.Im so glad youre coming with me.Your work is fabulous.Jali grinned at the complement.Now I need to make me some clothes.And at least two outfits for everyone else whos coming.Is it all final?Yes.Six of us.You, me, KJ, Ani, Dayn, and one more.And Naveen of course.Not that youll have to dress him.No, but Ive been stealing ideas from his outfits.Joel?Hes staying?Someone has to run things.Whos the one more?Im choosing.Joel is letting you pick?He assigned KJ, Ani, and Dayn.Well, Dayn is good for you, he keeps your head from getting big.I suspect Joel knows that.Ruby laughed.It is hard to be stuck up with Dayn around to stick a pin in you.She looked back at the dress, which perfectly set off her pale complexion, hid her freckles, and added sensuality even though it covered almost every inch of her.Dayn must be along to balance you.You make me so beautiful my head expands.Youre keeping a secret.Maybe.Ruby shrugged and looked in the long mirror one more time.Should the collar be a little lower?Jali frowned.No.Okay.Get me out of this.Jali undid the pins shed used to close the dress.By the time Ruby put it back on, there would be buttons there.When do you need to know the sixth person?Yesterday.Ruby sighed.Soon, Jali said.Im shopping again in the morning.Theres a good sale going on at the ColorMe booth, and I want to get there early.Ruby looked over the ten or twelve new outfits Jali had conjured up in just the past week.Thanks for being so fabulous.The extra credits helped.Naveen had shown up with a few thousand extra credits, mumbling something about her songs selling really well in advance of the concerts.Hed told her to use the extra for clothing, and she had.Half of them.The rest went into the community funds, and Jali had done such a good job that Naveen would surely never know she hadnt exactly obeyed him.Ruby dressed back in her regular clothes, comfortable dark gray pants and a washed pale blue shirt Jali had made her, way back on the Fire.Theres only a week left, Jali said.Are you scared?Never.Youre lying through your teeth.Of course I am.Im terrified.But now, she gestured at the dress Jali had just taken off her.Now Im excited, too.Are you?Jali laughed.Im glad to be busy, and it will be an honor to go with you.Youre being way too formal, Ruby laughed.She kissed Jali on the cheek to loosen her up and headed out.At the door, she stopped and addressed the whispering women for the first time in three days.Lyacan we talk?Lya looked startled at Rubys invitation.During the fitting, she had been in a boneless slump on the floor, one shoulder leaning into a wall.She had managed to scramble to a stand, but now her feet stood as if welded to the floor.Well, not quite right or not, she had succeeded in creating the women in white.Come on, Ruby said.Allens serving up mint tea over in the bar.Hed love to have a customer or two.I ...Lya glanced at the other two women, as if lost for words.Just us, please.Go, Min said.Go on.Ruby assessed.Min looked good, still thin, but with clear definition in her muscles and color on her face.The cut had finished healing and become a puckered brown and red line from under her left eye, across her nose, and down her right cheek.Ruby smiled at her, testing, pleased to see Min return her smile, if only with a light uptick in the corners of her fine, small mouth.In spite of Mins encouragement, Lya remained silent for an extra awkward beat before she said, Very well.Ruby frowned but let it go.She led Lya down two levels and found an empty table in the half full bar.She made sure they sat close to a microphone.Naveen had succeeded in wiring Ix/Aleesi into the communitys speaker system so that the combined machines could hear.He had not been able to separate out the two machines in such a way that they had separate inputs and outputs; the webling had not been designed that way.Nor had they been given a voice except in the one small room where the webling lived.Nevertheless, they would hear the conversation and Ruby would be able to ask them about it later, or to use them to replay parts.Allen stood on a ladder, hanging pictures and lights with the help of two maintenance bots.The bots were about the size of his hand, and able to cling to the walls and even climb.He looked over as Ruby and Lya settled, waved, and commanded a serving robot to take their order.Ruby frowned as it neared.The robot had never seen the inside of the Fire.Something Naveen had provided?Or someone had spent secret credits on?The underground economy that had been the cargo bars seemed intent on re emerging here where they couldnt afford it.Something to talk to Ix about later.And Joel.How could she leave?Things werent settled here.Ruby turned to look at her immediate problem.Lya sat more normally now than she had in the corridor, and her face had gone into the blank, patient waiting posture she often used when she and her women were witnessing instead of whispering.Following Ruby around had been good to her in some ways.She looked stronger than she had when this first started.Ruby ordered tea for the two of them and watched the bot slide smoothly across the smooth floor until it had almost returned to Allen.Perfect.New.All of it.Surely the whole station wasnt perfect and new.But then, the little she knew of their history suggested that the denizens of the Deep tore it apart and remade it regularly.She dragged her attention back to Lya.She must be too tired again; it was hard to focus her thoughts.Lya raised her head and met Ruby eye to eye.Why did you want to talk to me?Im going to leave soon for a tour.No kidding.In fancy dresses.Ive always worn costumes to perform.No you havent.When I was on stage.Ruby sighed and waited a long moment, then looked into Lyas eyes.This isnt working for me.A small smile crossed Lyas lips, then disappeared.I know thats what you wanted.To make it hard for me.But youre hurting everyone.Not because youre irritating me; I can handle that.But youre not helping with any of the things we actually need.I am watching out for us.I dont understand.We were never friends, but we used to live in the same pod, go to the same school.We knew the same people.Lya gave a short bitter laugh.You dont protect us anymore.So I am merely protecting us from you.Im gathering everything I can find out about what youre doing, and telling people.She looked down at the table in front of her.They need to know you dont really care about them.You know better than that, Ruby snapped, immediately sorry that Lya was getting to her.You can see how hard Im working.To get dressed up?To be the fancy whore here like you were back on our ship?Ruby didnt slap Lya, although her arm twitched.I see you with good food and good clothes and able to leave whenever you want.Are you going to leave Joel for Naveen and abandon us?Are you just taking care of yourself?Ruby couldnt rise to Lyas bait.As soon as Lya took a breath, Ruby said, Im trying to make a place for us here.We should never have come here.Were slaves.Were tied to the future of the same people who misused us, and youre pretending its all pretty and sweet, that we really all get along, even though its not true.Were still kept down, but youre so wrapped up in your fame you dont even see it.It was amazing Lya had any followers at all.She wasnt making any sense.The robot reappeared with white cups full of steaming green tea that smelled wonderful.More credit spent on the cups.Ruby held the tea in her hands, letting it warm them.She counted three deep breaths before she continued.We had to go somewhere.Lym is no longer home to anyone.We could have ended up floating forever around a planet while the Fire finished falling apart.So why are we all together?Were doing almost all the work now.Just like before.Only now were feeding the reds and the greens and the blues and theyre doing nothing.Its all on our backs to keep things going.Take us away, and leave them.If you really care.Ruby thought of SueAnne patiently keeping books from her wheelchair, of Jali sewing late into every night to get them all ready, of KJ and Joel and Conroy and The Jackman working to set up physical programs and to keep people training.But none of that was what Lya wanted to hear.You could be right as far as manual work.We are good at that and should be proud of it.But others are working, too.In a lot of ways.I do know that KJs dancers are earning credit.And keeping some of it.Ruby hated that as much as Lya.I dont make all of the decisions.Im going out to do two things, which you should know if youve really been witnessing, and thinking about what you hear.Lya did flinch.To learn about the Diamond Deep andhopefullymake us enough credit to thrive here.Lya started to say something and Ruby held up a hand to interrupt her.Begging for work at the Exchangeno matter who does the workis leading us to a bad future.To something I cant let happen.She shivered at the thought of the Brawl.Lya would die in there in no time.Many of them would.This trip matters.Why should we believe you are doing this for us?There.That was the question she wanted.You dont have to believe anything.Im going to offer you a trade.Lya looked puzzled.Im not going to be here for you to follow around.Nor will I be here to keep Joel from locking you up if you follow him around.Ruby gave her a beat to talk into, but Lya didnt use it.So Ruby kept going.I need you to help here.If you agree to help Marcelle in the schoolsto do what she asks you to, and to attend three hours of classes a dayyou and all of your people ...Lya frowned and looked unhappy but again she said nothing.Then I will take Min with me.You will be able to witness the trip.If theres a way for her to communicate back to you, shell be able to.Lyas eyes narrowed.Why Min?Because Joel will only let me take someone who is also able to guard.Min is trained as a fighter, and now she looks like one, too.Lya stood up as if she planned to leave without answering.I had wondered if she was a traitor.Lya!Ruby barked.Sit down.To her surprise Lya obeyed.If Min is a traitor to you, I dont know it.I havent talked to her since we arrived here, and if I had, youd know since youre following me around like a shadow.Lya picked her cup up and hugged it.You claim you hate me because Hugh died fighting for us.Not for me, for us.He loved you, Lya whispered.He loved you so much.And he died for you.He died for you, too.I told him not to fight.Both of their voices were rising.Other people in the bar had started to watch them.Ruby tried to modulate, managed a whisper that still sounded angry.No one should die young.But the world isnt fair.Maybe you do hate me.Thats not fair either.We were never close friends even before.But I do what Im doing because of a friend of mine who died once, and because of Ben.Were both honoring the dead.Lya licked her lips.Her hands shook.You didnt know my friends, Ruby said, more slowly.But I knew Hugh and you knew Ben.I need you to trust me.To believe that Im honoring them both while I try to save us all.Lyas answering laugh sounded bitter.I cant believe how arrogant you are.Will you do it?Promise me youll help the colony while Im away?Will you tell everybody what youre doing before you go?And why?I dont have time.For your people?Ruby sighed.There was so much work.She needed a month of sleep.Okay.Youre right.I will, in trade for Min and the return of your women in white to helping the community as much as you can.While youre gone.The deal wasnt perfect, but at least Lya and her followers would be safe from Joel.Lya would be doing something useful, and Ruby would have Min.She couldperhapsuse her to build a bridge back into the whispering women.The thought chilled her.It was so ...calculating.Not how she pictured herself.They were fracturing.She leaned over the small table so that her face was close to Lyas.Thank you.All bets are off when you get back.Ruby allowed Lya to have the last word.52     Ruby surveyed the kitchen table.Naveen had helped her procure fresh vegetables and fruit, bread so soft that a small chunk shed broken off to taste had disappeared in her mouth before she swallowed, and three sharp, tangy spreads.Best of all, there was a tall bottle of chilled wine.All of it food theyd never seen before they came here.She felt too nervous to write, so she paced for almost an hour before Joel came in.He glanced at her face and then at the table, his face frozen and his back stiff.Whats the matter?she asked.Everything.Sit down.Naveen brought us food.If the table were a person, his gaze would have cowed it into sitting down.Im not hungry.She crossed the room and stood beside him.She could feel his tension without touching him, almost smell it on him.Did something happen?I heard how you took care of those women.You cant do that.She stilled and took a deep breath.Cant do what?Take one of them with you.You cant reward them for disrespecting you.Ruby poured two glasses of deep red wine.I already asked her.She can fight.She held a glass out to him.Its not as if I asked Lya.Take Chitt.Take Samara.Take a dancer.But not one of your enemies.We need one of the old worker class people with us.Fine.Take The Jackman.He finally took the glass and downed half of it in one long pull.He hates me.Besides, we want to look friendly.Isnt Min the one with the scar?She hadnt realized he knew that.Yes.Jali can dress her up.Shes the right size to wear some of Darias clothes.Take Daria.Shes no fighter.This is my trip.It will only be a few weeks, and I needed Lya and her women to be out of your hair while Im gone.She took a sip of the wine, rolling the bitterness on her tongue, savoring it.Besides, KJ is going to be with me.What could go wrong?Everything.Anything.He put a hand on her shoulder, stiff and heavy.She stepped into him, trying to lift his frustration with touch.They stood that way, close but stiff, like two strangers forced into a small space.He put a hand on her face, his palm big enough to cup her entire cheek.Look.We dont have to do this at all.You dont have to go.We can still go find Laird and the others.Koren found me yesterday, and her offer is still open.She stepped back, her mouth open.You would abandon them all?I saw Laird in the Exchange today.He has a job helping with the stations defenses, loves what he does.He lives in a place thats all his own, and he looks healthier than any of usever.He truly looked torn.We could be that happy.We could.Ruby felt like all of her had tensed all over again, like even the blood in her heart had stopped in protest.The guilt would kill us.Youre pushing yourself too hard.Its not possible to do what you want to do.We cant make enough to save everyone, but I want to save you.She spun away from him, staring at the wall, too furious to say anything else.He came up behind her, close enough that she heard him breathe.Ive been watching you get more and more exhausted.More worried.This is not the Fire.If it were, I would be the captain and I would be responsible and I would be happy you were helping.But this is a trap and we cant get everyone out of it.He paused, and although she couldnt see it, it felt as if he reached for her and then dropped his hand.And taking Korens help isnt?Its all a trap, Joel.This whole place is a trap.We have to stay together.Im taking Min because I need a lever to understand Lya, to change her.If you were with them all the time, serenading them from task to task, they wouldnt be happy.His sounded so bitter it pulled at her heart even while she was mad at him.You cannot do all the books, get all the jobs, write and sing, work with Ix, and communicate to everyone all the time.There is only one of you.There is no win here.We were lost the moment we decided to come here.She turned to face him.You could come with me.Leave Onor in charge.Leave KJ back here with Onor.He went silent.For a moment, she thought he might be considering it.I would lose whatever reputation I have left.Part Five          53     Ruby slid into the silky soft pantsuit that Jali had crafted for travel.She belted a multi colored scarf over the loose green top, picked up one of the simple beaded necklaces she wore in the early days, when she might have been locked up for wearing one.The colors didnt quite match the fancy new outfit.But it made her smile, and feel a bit like her old self.She dropped it over her head.Joel waited in the living room, his jaw set and his eyes cold.Good morning.They had slept as far apart as their bed allowed, barely touching in the night.She had tried to soften him with caresses twice, and he had merely grunted and refused to roll over and meet her eyes.But he was looking at her now.She said, I have to leave.It might save us all.He thinned his lips and closed his eyes.It wasnt like him to be petulant.I dont want to leave you.Im sorry.But its the best thing I know how to do.Well talk every day.Our people need you there for them.They need your strength, your power.He turned away, staring at a picture on the wall.Damn it.She needed this one person, this one love, this one central fact in her life.He was part of how she thought about herself.She contemplated his back.He looked stiff and way too serious.Its not as if you can hold a note.His shoulders relaxed, if only a tiny bit.But if you want to come along and try well record you and send you back here for everyone to listen to.He turned and took her into his arms, rubbing his strong thumbs along each side of her spine, the smooth material letting them slide right into the soft places between muscles.We should beg for an hours grace and return to bed.I should have made love to you all night.She whispered, Well have more time.I will come back.You had better.And you, she pulled back and looked up at him, you need to be here waiting for me.Her throat felt thick.I know.He leaned down and kissed her, taking her mouth as hard as he ever had, his tongue questing and demanding, stamping her as his.The door announced the arrival of a pack robot to get her bags.Ruby had trouble breaking from his arms to let it in.Maybe they should fight more often.She walked beside Joel and behind the short, square pack robot.It had four wheels for legs, and made a soft whirr as it moved down the corridor.At the doorway between home and the rest of the Diamond Deep, she found Jaliet, Dayn, Ani, and KJ waiting for her.A small crowd of well wishers gathered a respectful distance away.Haric also stood by the door, a small bag at his feet.He looked at her with such hope in his eyes that she winced.She went directly to him before she even acknowledged the others.She knelt so that he would be a little taller than her.I would love to be able to take you.But I cant.He held up his slate.There was figure of twenty credits on it.I can help pay my way.I earned this, working.Off the system, so the credits went to me.It took me three days of cleaning out garbage containers.His chin quivered ever so slightly.He read the look on her face, and looked down at the ground.You found that work by yourself?How?I asked.One of the men thats helping Allen build out the bar knew.Really?Did you have to pay him for finding you the job?He looked back at her.Only two credits.She hoped her pride showed on her face.Youre growing up.Someone will need to take care of you while youre traveling.I know how to do that.I know you do.She hadnt even thought of him, and she should have.Although she did need Min.Damn it.I cant take everyone I care for.She paused, and kept looking at him until he nodded.You can help me, though.You can figure out how to have more people doing what you did.Thats enough credits for ten days of life support.Give it to SueAnne, and work with her to figure out how more people can do that kind of thing.She sensed he was fighting tears.But he squared his shoulders and stepped back into the crowd that had gathered to see them off.Onor and Marcelle, SueAnne in her wheelchair, Lya (of course, and wearing a sour face), Allen, others.As she watched Haric fade behind Onor, she felt the sudden loss of connection.She would be able to talk to them all because of the slates, at least to the extent that she had time.But she wouldnt be able to hold them or see them.Marcelles belly had grown big enough she could have her baby before Ruby got back.It wasnt likely, but sometimes first children came early.Relief flooded her as Min made her way through the group.Shed chosen to wear white, and Ruby wondered if that was all that was in her bag.In spite of the small defiance of her wardrobe, she looked scared, her eyes big and her lips thin.The door opened.Naveen stood behind it, dressed in fabulous browns that glittered with golden threads and hints of blues.His clothes flowed as he walked toward them and everything Jali had made, even the outfits that had seemed over the top, dulled in her memory.She smiled at his finery.This trip would be for show.Like an echo of the feeling of separation that had just nearly stopped her, she felt repulsed by what she was about to do.Her day to day work for the community would end while she did this.She would dine and sleep well, and be pampered.All this, while SueAnne fretted about the cost of food and Joel struggled to keep people working, while most of her people had never left this small, awful place that was so much less than the Fire had been.She needed to be spectacular.She hesitated, suddenly feeling the job was impossible, like she was tiny in the vast Deep.Ruby took a deep breath and gave Joel a last long look before she greeted Naveen with the bravest smile she could muster.54     Onor watched the gentle curve of Marcelles lips as she blew on the tea SueAnne had sent for her.She took a tiny sip, and placed the teacup back on her desk.That is good.SueAnne said it would help calm your tummy.I feel like a house.If it werent for her pregnancy, they would surely be with Ruby instead of here, fighting disease and the boredom of the masses.I know.How was your day?Schools interesting.Its far more interesting than what we got on the Fire.Ix is attending classes instead of giving them.Youd like the one we had today on intelligence.I wish I had time.Did you know there are five recognized species of AI?And three different classes of body they can inherit?No.Here, taste this.She passed him over the tea.The infirmary is full.Theres still the sickness, the same one.Were calling it a Deep Flu.She glanced over at him, and when he didnt say anything, she continued.We lost two more old people.Keep SueAnne away.I hadnt heard it was contagious.I dont think so.But Id rather not take risks.SueAnne is a savior.I never thought Id say that about someone from command.Were part of command now.She sighed.It was easier not to be.People keep looking at me like I shouldnt have this job.Like Im too young or too favored.You are.She made a face.Ruby trusts us, Onor said.If you think the Deep Flu is contagious, tell me.I dont.Not really.Besides, what would that change?Our medical staff think its not, right?Right.She reached for the tea.I havent tasted it yet.He did.Bitter.Wow.You like that?Yes.How about you?Allens hired two people in from the Deep to help get the bar built.Theyre doing awesome work.She laughed.Youre kidding.With all of our unemployed people, were paying someone else?Just to do things we cant.Youre going to be amazed.She looked away.It was a running argument between them; she wanted more resources for the infirmary and the school, and he wanted to keep people busy.The bar itself had become almost like a shared dream for the old cargo bar people.As far as the rest of the credit allocation problems, Onor counted himself lucky that Joel and SueAnne were making the final decisions.He and Marcelle might never agree on some topics.He stood up.Ive got to go.Dont you take any risks with this disease.She turned back to him slowly.Just keep me in this tea and dont bring me any new food.Ill stick to the squares.So she really was worried?But it was only children and old people who were getting the ...what was it?Deep Flu.Let me know how things stay in the infirmary.So you can take the dead off the daily tax rolls?Dont sound so bitter.So we can tell if we need to try and do something.What do you mean by that?He was going to walk into a trap.He could feel it.But he opened the door anyway, since hed started.Im sure there are medical resources somewhere on the ship.She stared at him.But those would cost credit.Of course.How much?I hear its a lot.A few days of a robot doctor could cost a few hundred credits.More than everyone in the colony is earning for the common pot these days.He could see from the look on her face that hed been right to suspect he was stepping into trouble.Look, you didnt see the Brawl.You havent been outside.You dont know how bad it can be.We need time, and the only way to have time is not to spend credit while were learning to earn it.You agree with that?You think these peopleincluding the childrencould be saved and youre advocating that we dont do it?She stood up, one hand on her belly.The rest of her seemed to have thinned, and the angry set of her jaw made her face look pinched.He swallowed.We dont know if they can be saved.We have to think long term.Since when did any of us not take care of our own?All of the rules have changed.She fell silent.When she spoke, she did so slowly and in a measured way.No.No they havent.There are new rules imposed on us from the outside.But our own morality?We have always cared for everyone.Thats how we survived.When people like Koren talk about ships like the Fire coming home empty, Im sure its from lack of caring.He spoke as evenly as she had.My parents were murdered.Hugh died fighting.Rubys friend Nona died in the warrens under the gray levels after two reds raped her.But wewe the grayswe never let our children or old people die if we could help it.Fighting over power is one bad thing, and youre right.It was bad.It was awful.Thats why we revolted.But if we fail to care now, it will be worse.How can you think any other way?Can you accept that theres no good choice?She shook her head and stared at some spot on the wall above him.There are still right choices.Pass that on.Tell SueAnne and Joel what I said, even if you dont believe it.I do believe it.You just havent seen the Brawl.Can it really be worse than watching children die?He went around the desk and took the teacup from her hand.It could be the same.55     Ruby waited offstage.Naveen stood beside her, close enough to hear his breathing and smell the strong drink shed seen him toss off a few moments ago.Other than the slight sickly scent of alcohol, he showed no effects of the liquor at all.He had dressed down this time, still sparkly but much less flamboyant than what he had worn to travel in.Why arent you dressed up?she asked him.You look almost like a normal man.To highlight you.I still think I should have worn an old work jumpsuit.You are too beautiful for that.She thought about cussing at him, but it didnt seem worth the effort.She had never sung with someone else managing the events, and she hated it.Jali and Ani stood on her other side.Jali had finally stopped adjusting Rubys outfita soft swirling dress with a low cut front and a high hem over the softest boots Ruby had ever worn.She had settled for whispering small reminders instead.Keep your head up.A few moments later, Shoulders back, spine straight.Cussing at Jali crossed her mind as well.Instead, she touched her friends shoulder.Thanks for being here.How do you feel?Im okay.She really did feel better; prestage adrenaline always drove away stress and fatigue, always strengthened her.Min stood to the side, alone, looking over the crowd that had gathered in the huge theater.Ruby hadnt found time for a private conversation with her yet, and so far Min had hardly said a word to anyone.Unlike everyone else in the group, she had never left Ash, not even to visit the Exchange.If Ruby felt overwhelmed, how must Min feel?The concert hall reminded Ruby of the cargo bars.Like the bars, the hall had been created inside the bay of a spaceship.Lights flicked playfully along the ceiling, as if making a little preshow for the audience.There was a flat area at the foot of the stage and beyond that, seats climbing up an incline.The walls were decorated with pictures of birds and dragons, almost like the old parks from home.Naveen had explained that the Star Bear had been turned into a concert venue so the owner, Satyana Adams, could raise credit to fix her broken ship or buy a new one.Hed said, When the concerts on a ship succeeded beyond all of her hopes, Satyana decided it was cheaper to stay.Shed found what shes good atmaking large groups of people happy.In the meantime, the stage was big enough for a hundred people, and Ruby felt tiny.How many in the audience?she asked Naveen.Physical?Theres ten thousand seats and theyve sold out.More than all the people from the Fire.If her cut was two credits from every one of them, she could buy two days for everyone, plus a little more.Virtual?People could pay to watch from wherever they were.A credit for each of them.How many?Naveen shrugged.Were at seven thousand, but eighty percent of a virtual audience tunes in right on time.He pointed at a screen on the wall, angled so that no light from it fell onto the stage.Numbers counted up too fast for her to see.When she looked back at Naveen she could tell from his face that he liked the numbers.Another day of life, and more.And she hadnt opened her mouth to sing here yet.She closed her eyes for a moment and vowed to be fantastic.The light in the big bay dimmed.Naveen left her side and strode onto the vast stage, a light following him and elongating his shadow, as if it reached for the back of the stage.Thank you, thank you for being here.Im pleased to introduce the newest star of the Diamond Deep, a part of our past returned to us in absolute glory ...Ruby half listened as Naveen talked her up.The virtual count passed the ten thousand of the physical count, doubled it.Her stomach gave her fits in a way that had never happened to her before.Sharper and more full of bile, so her mouth tasted of fear.What if they hated her?Naveen beckoned.Jaliets hand landed in the small of her back, propelling her toward the stage.Ani whispered, Good luck.She took three steps.The stage felt huge, just like she had expected it to.No, worse.Lights blinded her.Naveen had warned her to shut her eyes and blink them open and she did so, fast.She held her head up and looked out at the audience.Naveen had not warned her the audience would be almost invisible.She could only see the faces closest to the stage.
