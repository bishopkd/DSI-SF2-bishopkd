       Pain.Whispering voices.Pain.Pain.Pain.Pain.Need pee  new pain  what are they sticking in me?...Sleep.Pain.Whispering voices.As you know, Nurse Eastman, the government spooks controlling this hospital  will not permit me to give this patient the care I think he needs.Yes, doctor.The voice was breathy, sweet, so sweet and sexy.We will therefore just monitor his sign    s.   Serious trauma like this patient  suffered requires extra care, but the rich patsies controlling the hospital will make certain  I cannot try any of my new treatments on him.Yes, doctor.That voice was soooo sexy!Bruce didnt care about treatments.He car ed about pain, and he cared about that  voice, because when he heard the voice, the pain went away, just for a few seconds, like.Report to me if there is any change, the mans voice said.Yes, Dr.Nance, said the sexy voice.A door closed, and Bruce heard breathing, and smelled the enticing smell of  shampoo, and perfume.It was Chanel Number 5.He opened his eyes.All he saw was the roundest, firmest pair of  tittles hed ever seen in his life, all  enclosed in a crisp white nurses uniform.Im in heaven, he said.No, he tried to say, but his voice wouldnt work, his  mouth was dry, and there was some terrible tube thing in his noseand hey, whats that  thing in his dick?It hurts!The tits bounced like Aunt Alices molded jello back at home, and then moved  away.Oh.She was just straightening the covers on the bed.Bed.Bruce realized he laid in a bed, his left arm being strapped down, with something  sticking an up a tube  on the top of his hand.Bruce looked up.The tits belonged to a beau  tiful face carved out of ice and whipped  cream, with a pair of glowing emerald ey  es.Around that perfect face was brown hair  like one of those super models, all puffed up.Oh, youre awake, Mr.Lucent, said the sexy nurse.Bruce worked his lips, but couldnt speak.Well, Mr.Lucent, the sexy voice went  on.You are probably wondering what  you are doing here, honey chile.He realized the voice had the accent of a sexy  Southern peach.You were in an auto accident, Mr.Lucent, but dont worry.Youll be  jess fine.This here is the finest hospital in  Atlanta, and you are in the care of the finest  doctor, Dr.Arthur Eastman.Bruce tried to speak, but just moaned.Now, is there anything I can get you?Nurse Eastman asked, moving around to  the other sides of the bed, and fluffing the pillow.Bruce wanted to feel those titties, that was what he wanted.Not that he could do  much else, he realized.Everything hurt, right  down to that thing, whatever it was, in his  dick."Uh, he said.Nurse Eastmans eyes lit up like Christma s tree lights.Now youre talking!Oh, she gave a girlish giggle.You are    recovering jess fine!I have to go tell Dr.Eastman, right away.Wait ...he grated.She paused, giggling again.A frighten  ed giggle now.A childish giggle.As  though a little girl on Halloween, going door to  door, instead of seeing a paper Mackay  witch or goblin suddenly was grabbed by the real thing.I dont remember ...Bruce croaked.I dont remember!No, she said, shaking her head vehemently.You dont remember a thing.Now, you jess rest!She went to the door, her hips swaying like palm trees in a Hawaiian hurricane.Bruce lied there in the bed, trying to recover his memory.All he could remember  was the screeching of tires', like a steam engi ne gone crazy, and then there was just all  that pain.Hell.Hell on wheels, thats what it was, yeses.Hell.On wheels.* * *         While outside the door, Nurse Eastman lean ed against the wall, her breasts rising  and falling with passion as she tried to control her gasps.Oh no, she thought.How  could it be?Out of all the hospitals in Georgia, they would bring him here.She raised shaking fingers and outlined the shape of her lips, moaning softly as  she remembered the one day shed met Bruce Lucent.The single day, at the high school  prom.Shed gone with her cousin to please their parents, since his date got sick and he  had rented his tux and everything, even t hough she was in nursing college.Enchantment  Under the Sea, it was called ...she could remember it as if it was yesterday ...their eye  met across the room, locked, held, molding pa ssionately.It was a gaze of molten heat, a  supernova of total lust, even though he was only seventeen and she was twenty three.It was only a matter of time before she d itched her cousin and Bruce ditched his  date, and they found themselves in the back of Bruces Chevy ...She moaned, writhing in memory, until a voice splintered, shattered, pierced her  memory.Nurse Eastman!It was the Head Nurse!Her warty nose  quivered, her eyes blazed with suspicion.The old bag!She wouldnt know what true love really was.I'm sorry, Margaret Eastman smiled.I just had a cramp.If you are sick, you may be excused from your shift, the Head Nurse opined.II will be fine.But I promised Dr  .Nance I would let him know when his  patient woke up, Margaret gritted, and ran aw ay before the Head Nurse could stop her,  her high heels clattering on the floor like the death knells of doom.Doctor Arthur Nance looked up when the nurse entered the room.Arthur had always been the brightest star  at school, from a very early age.He  was always elected class president in  grammar school, middle school, and high school.He was Class Valedictorian at his graduati  on, and when a lot of his friends went to  mechanic school, or junior college to mess ar ound with business, he went straight to the  university medical school.But their Arthur ran into something     far worse than tough teachers or tough  grades: prejudice.Yes, prejudice.Not race,  but class.All the snobs from the wealthy  families laughed at him for his accent, and    when he tried to join the most popular  fraternities on campus, they hazed him wit  hout letting him know until too late that he  would never join.Arthur got his medical degree, but he became embittered, against rich people, and  politicians, and anyone in authority.Whereev er he went, he was sure there was some  conspiracy against him, by those in authority.He was sure of it when he didnt get hi     red to any private hospitals, or to a  lucrative practice among the rich, doing fat re moval and face lifts for twenty five grand  apiece.No, he could only get a job in th  is hellhole, where every night the ambulances  brought in drunks and suicides and crazily homeless and the battered wrecks the EMTs  scraped off the freeways.Like this Lucent jerk.Arthur was sitting there brooding about all these ills when Nurse Eastman came  into the doctor room.Is my patient awake?he asked.Yes, she said, and then she wiped her  eyes and throatily whispered, Doctor, I  have to request that you excuse me from attending to this patient.Request denied, Dr.Nance said curtly.I will not have one of those braided  spies who work for the hospital trustees k  illing my patient!Ill go sees he now, he  stormed, and stormed out of the room.Margaret leaned against the wall and wept a sorrowing floodlike of tears.She knew Bruce would emerge from the        fog of the painkillers and he would  recognize her.What if he told someone about that night at the prom?All her life Margaret had worked hard, harder than anyone else.Her sisters, all of  them far more beautiful than she, had coasted through life like a toboggan down the snow  hill of life.But Margaret had a vision at an  early age, and knew she was meant to be a nurse.Her mother had scorned her.Her father had laughed at her.So she put herself  through nursing school by waiting tables at a lo  w dive at night.Five long years she  toiled, with never a day off, not even at Chri  stmas, just so she could walk out with her  head held high, and her degree in her hand.Once, just once, she had strayed from the  path of hard work.Just once shed let  herself relax.Do her cousin Ted a favor.Go as his date to the prom.Well, shed learned her lessonshe thought .She never thought shed see Bruce  Lucent again, but now, here, the  cruelty of the fates laughed at her, just like her family.Bruce Lucent was here, helpless, in her hospital, and it was only a matter of time before  he remembered who she was, and what would he do then?She wept even harder.The Atlanta sun slanted low in the west, rain showers predicted for later that  afternoon, then clearing.Bruce Lucent looked from the side window of his friend's shiny  Maserati sports car as they wheeled their way westward against the afternoon traffic."I'm glad you could give me a ride,"  Bruce Lucent muttered, his pain worn face  reddened by the yellow sunlight."What with my new car all smashed and all. "His old friend, Isadore, shook his massive head at him."We know how it must be  to have a lot of money but no working car," he said, the harsh Macon County drawl of his  voice softened by his years in Atlanta high society."It's my pleasure to bring you back to  your fancy apartment, and we're all so happy that y'all is still alive.Y'all could have been  killed in that dreadful wreck. "Isadore paus ed to put on the turn signal before making a  safe turn across rush hour traffic into the  parking lot of Bruce Lucent's luxury apartment  building."Y'all'll gets a new car on Monday. ""I don't know how I'll be able to drive it   with my arm in a cast," Bruce Lucent  shoots back."It's lucky I wasn't killed out right like so many people are when they have  horrid automobile wrecks. ""Fortunately, fast and efficient Emergency Medical Services, based on a program  founded by Lyndon Baines Johnson the 36th President of the United States helped y'all survive an otherwise, deadly crash," Isadore chuckled.He nodded his head toward the  towering apartment building, in the very shadow of Peachtree Avenue, where Bruce lived  his luxurious life.So young, yet so wealthy,   based on his skills as an expert software  developer."I don't feel very fortunate," Bruce compla ined as his friend helped him from the  low slung red car, "I hurt all over and I don't remember a thing after I left that bar over  on Martin Avenue.I wouldn't be surprised if the police didn't want to talk to me about  what happened.Not that I could help them because I don't remember anything" he added  as an afterthought.Isadore pulled the collapsible wheelchair that he'd bought at Saint Irene's Hospital  from the open trunk of his new Maserati and  unfolded it on the curb beside where Bruce  painfully stood, his recent ordeal only recently over.He helped his chum sit in the new  wheelchair, and then pushed it rapidly toward  the gleaming doors of the high rise tower.The soft Southern breeze blew the sweet scent of magnolias over them as he said, "This  is certainly something new for me. ""Never say that," he replied.Isadore shook his head, his red ponytail flipping in the soft breeze, as he wheeled  his best friend into the lobby, past the uni formed security guard named Amos who  saluted them and then into the elevator to   the fourteenth floor of the luxury high rise  apartment building, recently built in downtown Atlanta.The longtime security guard saluted the pair as they passed.What lucky people,  he thought, so young and rich, they can afford to live here.Not like me.I have to live across town and wear a uniform and salute the young rich kids who make more money in  a minute than I can make in my whole life.Bruce thought that the dark elevator walls  were closing in on him and despite the  chill in the air conditioned air he could still smell the flower smells from outside.The  upward elevator started slowly into motion  as if it was reluctance to climb the hundreds  of feet."Hurry up," Bruce cried aloud.Bruce pounded on the arm of his recently acquired wheelchair as his friend asked  "Bruce, what's the matter?Is y'all so impatient to get home that the elevator is too slow  for you?Imagine if y'all had to take     the emergency stares in your condition" he  chuckled.Bruce glared at his friend who stood behind him and the wheelchair as the  elevator hissed to a halt on the fourteenth floor, the dark paneled doors sliding open with  the sound of well oiled machinery, and then he  was pushed by his friend out into the hall  and then down to the door labeled 1414, his apartment door.Bruce searched his pockets for the key that he knew he did not have."Dammit,"  he said, and then, "They kept everything even  my wallet at the hospital, how am I going  to get it?"Isadore knocked once at the door, and then it at once swung open.The stunning  vision inside, an echo of pulchritude in a bright red dress, seemed to take their breath  away, it was Penelope Urbain, Bruce Lucent's longtime and very beautiful girlfriends.Penelope, who had walked in the door of  Lucent Software, asking for a job, and a good  thing is being that she did, because he had one  for her, a position, so to speak, that only a  beautiful woman could fulfill, and she filled the role perfectly, as the beautiful girlfriend for those social occasions when he needed to  appear on the front page of the newspaper  with a beautiful woman on his arm.Ever yone looked and thought he was lucky, but it  wasn't just luck it was planning that he fell   in love with this beautiful woman and her  with him.He gave her his glance and she gave him hers.Bruce looked at her and whistled, thanki ng whatever god was listening that the  auto accident that he had apparently been in  had spared his family jewels for he wasn't  one to put to pasture his rampant desire  for his stunning young woman, at least not yet.He snapped his fingers and snarled, "Take me   inside, Isadore, or you're fired from my  software company. "Something like anger stirred in Isadore's breast, yet Isadore laughed at Bruce's  favorite joke as he pushed the millionaire    software developer indoctrinated by New  Agers into the stunning studio apartment that he  rented in this exclusive high rise tower.The walls were white as was the carpet.The walls met the ceiling at right angles, where  glistening mirrors in gold frames studded the walls.Penelope Urbain had been a poor girl   she knew, though she pretended to have  grown up rich and happy in the suburbs of A tlanta it was all a lie.Now she looked into  one of the many mirrors on that studded the walls of her boyfriend Bruce's apartment and  liked what she saw.Two hazel eyes with  perky eyebrows, red like the hair of her head  and other places, met her smoky gaze in the mirror.She smoothed the hair back from her  elfin ears, making it tumble down her back, pa st her shoulders, broad but not too broad,  broad enough to support the luxurious breasts that filled the front of her scarlet sun dress,  glowing in the afternoon sun, the hot Georgi a orb of fire, that came through the window, as she admired her trim shape and flat tu mmy, in the mirror.She looked, she thought,  like the bad girl heroine of a tawdry romance novel.The expensive shoes she wore, high heels that matched her tight dress, and set off  her red hair, were delicately shaped by the s tiletto heels and sharp toes, the lift they gave  curving her creamy calves and making her rounded bottom move like a semaphore of  love as she walked past the framed mirror  that she had been looking in.Her hazel eyes  sparkled as she took in the sight of her ne  wly returned boyfriend in the wheeled chair  that marked him some disabled person."Would you like a drinkie?"Penelope offere d her recently returned beau as his  friend pushed him in front of the wide screen  TV that dominated the west wall without  making it seem overpowering."Dammit, yes," Bruce Lucent repeated, looki ng at this vision of feminine lust on  two feet, "I've been in the lousy hospital a nd they don't let you have a little drink there,"  he opined."Then I want to get to my new computer so I can check on my hot stock  options and write more on my best selling soft ware development.I've wasted too much  time locked in that smelly hospital.It's full of sick, people. "Penelope and Isadore  looked at each other, as only two redheads   can look at one another as Bruce delivered  himself of this comment."Then let me fix you something nice w  ithexpensive vodka and gin," Penelope  giggled, as she went to the kitchen to ma  ke ice cubes.When she was young, she had  been called Penny, but now she was worth a lot more she mused, as she busied herself at  the full bar that filled the west wall beside  the large television set that Bruce had bought with the first proceeds of his award winning   mutual software.He often went on the  modern Internet, to make his money."And when Isadore's gone I can greet you  properly," Penelope whispered as she  handed the Old Fashioned to Bruce in his chrome wheelchair.She looked significantly at  Bruce's tanned, lean frame as she handed him the crystal glass."Yeah," Bruce responded  "What's he still doing hear?"He turned to  his old friend and pointed out, "Whys don't  you go park the car?My old car is crashed.You know. ""Yes, Bruce," Isadore smirked, as he turned, knowing what kind of scene of wild  debauchery was about to be enacted in th   at very room, because he had known it for  himself first hand during the long week Bruce  Lucent had been in the hospital."I'll go  park the car. "He went down the sleek elevator that      he had so shortly before ascended,  wondering if Bruce was going to be the man  he had been, before losing consciousness in  that horrible accident.Then the gleaming l obby doors were before him.He planned to  take the Maserati out onto Peachtree Avenue   in search of an empty parking place as  upstairs a miracle of love was performed   by Penelope and Bruce, young lovers at the  very height of their beauty, wealth, power, desire."Going down," Isadore Trent chuckled as he pressed the down button, and  laughing at his own joke.Had he but known what was to come he would have been  laughing out of the other side of his mouth.As you've probably heard Yvonne, began  Penelope Urbain.Seriously brushing  a gleaming scarlet tress out of her tearful eye Bruce has come home from the hospital  after his accident.Yes you must be very happy, said Yvonne sympathetically.He was badly hurt  in that auto accident.Yes he was badly hurt, responded Penelope honestly.But he is home now and  I am very happy about that.We need to have a very serious discussion about this, said Yvonne earnestly.Yes.We have some very serious things to discuss, agreed Penelope.Yvonne Perrin raised her glass and began to gulp down the martini she had  ordered and then she signaled the waiter to bring another one.Yvonne drank too much and did not eat right at all and Penelope was starting to get worried about her friend's  habits in eating and drinking.Her cheeks were  almost as red as her hair already, like red  Delicious apples under green leaves which were her eyes and the dark pupils were like  little curled up caterpillars in the middle.Do you think it is a good idea to have another 1 Yvonne?interrogated  Penelope.Yes one more will not hurt me and then I will quit, retorted Yvonne.They did not notice that Steven Suffern was watching them secretly from his table  across the dining room.They were at the Polo  Club for lunch.The restaurant was a large  room with a number of tables and some  big windows looking out over the golf course  and the lake.Both men and women and couples were eating lunch.Steven Suffern was  the best masseuse the Club had ever had.After lunch Yvonne might get a massage.She  thought he was a stud.Watching him across the room, with rippling muscles like a bull  and well hung too.She could see his pulsing   manhood stuffed into the tight silky blue  gym shorts he always wore at work.She  thought she should have made an appointment  for a massage.Steven Suffern thought Penelope was a   real looker far too good for that stuffy  software developer, Lucent who needed to work out once in a while and lose fifty  pounds.He flexed his muscles and thought about the book he had just read, The Joy of  Sex.It always surprised people that this athletic man was such a great reader and he liked  that.Hello ladies, said Steven Suffern passing their table.Hello Steven.Purred Yvonne.She had a crush on the handsome masseuse at the  Polo Club.Sometimes she saw him working out in the gym and she was turned on by the  sweat smell of his sweet.She could not wait to think of a plan to try to get him into bed  with her.Hello Steven.Penelope whispered softly.Do you have to work today?Maybe we  could get a massage later, said Yvonne  boldly.I only have room in my appointment book for one lady this afternoon,"  explained Steven.Oh that is all right.You go Yvonne, said Penelope kindly.She knew her friend had a crush on Steven who was a real stud.I must get back to Bruce anyway.He needs me.Steven would have liked to give her a  massage but he was stuck with her friend.Yvonne was too old for him.He stood up and walked past their table and flexed a bicep  for effect.See you later then Yvonne, he said meaningfully.Yvonne watched him go by his muscles  pulsing and rippling like waves under a  thin blanket of tanned skin like a freshly baked cinnamon cake.Penelope began to sip her  mint julep.I think he likes you Yvonne, said Penelope thoughtfully.Why do you think that Penelope?asked Yvonne Urbain.He always comes over to talk to us when we are eating lunch at the Polo Club,  explained Penelope.He is cute, I think so too.But I have Bruce already.I think you are the main attraction here for him not I!hissed Yvonne jealously.No, I am not, soothed Penelope.Anyway you can get a massage and have him  to yourself I will go home and take care of Bruce.The waiter walked over to their table and brought another martini for Yvonne  with a shot glass of extra vodka on the side.I did not order extra vodka!Said Yvonne impatiently.She was mad from the  conversation with her friend Penelope who all the men seemed to be attracted to.Her  cheeks were flaming red fires like a volcano  ready to explode through the cold emerald  stones that were her eyes.She knew Penelope thought she drank too much.The waiter said I am sorry Miss but we  are out of cocktail onions and the chef  sent this instead with his complements.Yvonne Perrin stood up and walked over to the waiter and took the shot glass full  of vodka and poured it out in a planter that  held a spindly rubber tree that never got  enough light to grow properly even though it  was near one of the windows that looked  out onto the lake where some ducks were floating like they were waiting for someone to  throw them some bread but there was nobody there at this time of day.Calm down.Yvonne people are staring at  you, said Penelope worriedly.Do  you feel ok?she asked questioningly.You never understand how I feel.moaned Yvonne.I am just as good looking  as you but I am older that is not fair.The men all go for you and you have Bruce already.I am afraid I will never find a man now that I am getting old.Yvonne sipped her martini which tasted  like liquid ice on her tongue.It helped  her feel calmer.She asked the waiter What brand of vodka is in this drink?It is a French vodka imported specially  for the Polo Club.Thinking that ought  to impress her and picking up the empty glasses from their table.Do you want to order  something to eat now?Yes.I will have steak, said Penelope decisively.And I want it cooked rarely.I  am a gourmet when it comes to beef so tell the cook not to overcook it. "Yes Ma'am.The waiter said smoothly.Anything else?he added.French Fries and please bring the horseradish sauce.A Caesar salad for me with blue cheese dressing.Yvonne decided.I am  watching my weight.Leave room for the desert.It is our chef special today, suggested the waiter.Yvonne could see the people at the next  table eating chocolate cake.Everybody  else had finished their lunch and gone now from the empty room.Yes pleased, she said  eagerly.She had gotten over her fit about the extra vodka.The waiter walked away.Now back to talking about Bruce, said Penelope Urbain brushing a strand of red  hair out of her eyes.I hope he will recover soon from his accident.Do not worry about that, exclaimed Yvonne.He is getting.The finest medical  care money can buy.And if the accident leaves a scar he can go to a plastic surgeon and  has it removed.I know a very good plastic surgeon in Atlanta.He did my nose for me  last year, she argued.Penelope wiped a teardrop from the corner  of her lovely almond shaped eyes.I  do not know what I would do without Bruce      if something happened to him.You say Steven Suffern likes me but I do not think I could go for a masseuse if something  happened and Bruce dies.Yvonne Perrin got angry.You are a snob, Penelope Urbain.She shouted  angrily.The crowd of people eating in the restaurant at the Polo Club put down their  knives and forks and stared at them.I am not, retorted Penelope in reply.You do not deserve the love of a man like  Bruce Lucent.He is the absolute most  eligible bachelors in Atlanta.And another one is Steven Suffern, Yvonne pointed out  heatedly.We have been friends for a long time.Penelope said wistfully.I do not want us  to fight over men.You are right, sighed Yvonne.Let us not  talk about this again.Waving her  hand to attract the waiter.I will pay for lunch today.The waiter stated Yes misses what would you like?I would like the bill, said Yvonne firmly.That will be one hundred and thirty four dollars plus tax responded the waiter.Put it on my tab I am a member of the Polo Club, said Yvonne grandly.Penelope knew she could not afford a bill like that but she had her pride.She  could not show her up before all the best society in Atlanta.She would never forgive her  if she did.I would be glad  to pay half.She offered gently.But her friend waved the  money away and stood up and began to walk to the door.I will make up for it when I get that     massage from Steven Suffern.She  exclaimed.Steven is a real stud and I am looking forward to it!She added eagerly.Yvonne could not do anything more.She decided to go home and sees Bruce.But  she was glad they had such a good discussion and cleared up things between them.Andrew Venice parked his car on the street in front of the house and double   checked the address he had written down on a slip of paper.Yeah, this was the place all  right.It was an ordinary house, on an ordinary street.There was nothing special about  it, just plain.Nothing here looked like it might be connected to murder or assault or  anything like that.Richard Isaacs, the man     hed come to interview, were a stock  manipulator, and youd think hed live in a fancier place, a nicer house, on a better street.But since he was also a police informant, maybe he wanted to keep a low profile, not do  anything to stand out.Not exactly like the witnesses' protection program, but not all that  different.Or maybe he just wasnt that good at manipulating stocks.Venice would try to  find out, in addition to finding out what he really came here to ask about.He put the note on the front seat, and hi  s sunglasses in the glove compartment,  checking his reflection in the rearview mirror and smoothing back his hair.Turning forty  was hard.He didnt know what hed been planning to do at forty, but he was damn sure  this wasnt it.Oh well.It was his job, and he was the one to do it.Hed better get going,  ask his questions, make his report.Then hed have time to stop by the gym later, work  out a bit, fight off the ravages of time.He was still in his prime, even if he had to work  harder to maintain it.Getting out of the car, he looked both ways, then shut the door and used the key  fob to lock all the doors.It wasnt a bad neighborhood or anything like that, but he still  didnt want to take any chances.He let a minivan go past, then an SUV, then he walked  around the front of his car and up the long sidewalk to the porch.A bench sat on the  porch, the kind you might sit on and drink some lemonade, but it didnt look used, like  nobody had had any lemonade to drink there for a while, or maybe they just didnt like  the porch or something.Isaacs probably had  to keep a low profile anyway.He wasnt  the kind of guy who spent a lot of time outside making friends with the neighbors.Venice went to knock on the door and stopped.There was a flyer lying on the  welcome mat.No, it was one of those bags   of advertisements they paid neighborhood  kids to deliver, one of those circulars.there was a cardboard box full of them just off to  the side of the door.He picked up the new  one and held it in his hand as he knocked on  the door with his knuckles, loud enough so       anyone inside could hear him but not  pounding or anything like that.Watching his  reflection in the storm door, smoothing the  lapels on his suit jacket so hed be sure to look nice, the door opened.Richard Isaacs were the man who answered the door.He looked over Venice  wondering who this guy was at  his door, and what he was doing there.Venice got into  his pocket and pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to a show hid badge.Hi, my name is Andrew Venice, he said cheerfully, like there was nothing  unusual about him showing up there in the middle of the day.Im here to ask you a few  questions.Its no big deal.That was just what Venice wanted him to think, Isaacs thought.They always said  it was no big deal when they were trying to nail you.I found this lying outside your door, Andrew said.You want it?What was this guy trying to do, being friendly to him?No, just toss it there into  the circular file, Isaacs pointed.Toss it into where?That box right there beside the door,    he said, pointed to the box.He was  getting mad.Its not a circle, its more of a square, said Venice.Or a rectangle maybe.Its a joke, all right?Now Issacs was really really mad.I put the circulars in  the circular file.But that crazy Venice guy just offered it again.You sure you dont want it.They got good deals inside, could save you some money.Just throw it away.I wish the kids would stop delivering them.Hey, listen, said Venice, sticking his hands into his pockets.I dont have all  day here.Im on an investigation.I came   to ask you some important questions, and I  want some answers.I dont have to answer anything you ask!Richard Isaacs replied forcefully.He  wanted to make a point.Are you going to st ay out there on the porch and scare off all  the neighbors or you going to come inside?Ill come inside and ask you my questions there.I want to ask you about  Margaret Eastman.Issacs knew he was going to be regretting this later.But he said, Come on  inside anyway.Even though he didnt want the guy inside.But what were you going to  do?Thats what they expected from you once you got messed up with the police.But he  didnt have to play their game.Venice walked into the living room, not  sure what to expect.Something about  Isaacs didnt add up right.Either he was living in a plain house in this plain  neighborhood because of frugality, because he     was cheap, or there was some other  reason.He couldnt figure Isaacs out, like   there was something he was hiding.Even  though Venice knew he was in his mid60s, he looked more like a tough guy than a stock  market expert.He had broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, muscular.His cheeks were  ruddy like he spent a lot of time outside in  the sun and the wind.Damn genetics.Some  people didnt have to work for anything and  had it all anyway.He didnt look like a guy  who had just turned 40 and needed Viagra to  get it up anymore.But Venice wasnt here  to feel sorry for himself.He had a job to do.And it was time to do it.Isaacs sat down in the brown reclining chai r with a plop, in front of the bigscreen  TV, and he pointed to the couch.Why  dont you sit down, he suggested, like a man  who meant it?Venice wasnt going to let himself be pushed around that way by some informant.I think Ill stand.Thisll just take a few minutes.So get started already!Isaacs would be glad when this interview was over so  he could watch his football game.You follow the Falcons at all?Im not really a football fan, said   Venice, although he split a pair of season  tickets with his brother in law, went to half the games.He looked at the TV for a second,  trying to spot Bill in the crowd.Bill was married to his little sister, Leslie, he adored  Leslie.Bill was a great guy, just the kind of  guy hed rather be spending the afternoon  with.Then he thought he sounded like some  wuss for saying that, so he added, I think  the West Coast offense really ought to open things up for Vick though.They should  make the playoffs next year.Yeah, said Isaacs, passionately.He loved football.He didnt mind all the  damn questions now so much, not if this Venice character liked the Falcons.So you  wanted to ask me about somebody, some Mary, Maury ...Her name is Margaret Eastman, Venice   said.His veins turned to ice at the  mention of her name.Things like that shouldnt happen to a young woman like her.Who is she?Issacs asked.Yeah!Who is she?The door to the kitchen slammed open and in walked the  most beautiful woman Venice had seen today,  or maybe in a week.The more he looked  at her, more he thought maybe in a lifetime, but he didnt have a whole lifetime of  experience yet.But she was incredibly beautiful.Her eyes burst with curiosity.Or  maybe it was jealousy.She was older, for a beautiful woman, maybe 40, maybe the exact  same age as Venice.She was wearing a bra under her tight blouse and she was wearing lipstick too, and he couldnt help staring at her.Her hair was pretty too, like it was made  out of silk, just that kind of shiny.Hey Monica, we need some privacy to  discuss business, says Isaacs.Its just  man talk, nothing youd be interested in.If its another woman again, you bet Im     interested, she said, adjusting her  breasts to make them stick out more.Venice  was still staring at her, he couldnt take his  eyes off her, and she was looking at his eyes , like she was touching herself for him, to be  prettier for him.He couldnt believe it.I dont know who she is, Issacs said,  and he was regretting inviting Venice into  the house again.You sure you dont know anything about her?Venice asked.Monica stared at him with her lips making a little red pout.If I knew anything  about her, you can bet Id let you know, she said, slapping Issacs on the top of his head.Ow!he said, grabbing the top of his head.He looked at Venice again and said I  said I dont know her or anything about  her.She was the nurse at the hospital where Bruce Lucent recovered from his  automobile accident, Venice said.Shes really beautiful, like you wouldnt believe.She has brown hair.I know you like women with brown hair  , you two timing jerks, Monica said,  she was hitting Isaacs on the top of his head again, and he jumped up and yelled.Stop that, I said I dont know anything, and I dont know her!I could show you pictures, Venice said.He had a lot of pictures of her, but he  didnt want to share all of them, not with this scum.It might help your memory some.Listen, buddies, Isaacs said.You came here, so you take what you get and  leave.I said I dont know anything, I dont know nothing, thats all there is to it.Why dont you take me?Monica purred at him.Hey now, I dont like that, Isaacs said, and now he was mad at all of them for  ruining his day.He was mad enough to hurt somebody.Hed killed a man before one  time, with his bare hands, and he could do it  again, if he put something in his bare hands  like a knife or a gun or something that he could kill somebody with.Venice sensed trouble ahead, but he wanted to see more of Monica.He had the  sense though that they were just ships passing in the night, that she was just some  temporary liaison of Richard Isaacs, probably just another cheap tramp or something like  all the others.Maybe she could be different, but it wasnt going to be in this lifetime, not  with him.Well, if you dont know anything, I guess Ill be going, he said.Walking down the sidewalk, the car waited for him at the curb.He stopped  before opening the door and looked back up at the house.He saw Isaacs standing in the  window frame looking back at him.Some body was hiding something here, but Venice  knew he was a bulldog.Hed get to the bottom of it yet.And it didnt matter who got hurt along the way, cause he was going to find out  the answers.There she was, the pretty nurse Steven had seen while he was visiting Bruce  Lucent in the hospital.It had just been luck, because he'd stepped out of Bruce's hospital  room, thinking about Bruce's ass  a nice, tight ass  when he'd seen her.Her hospital  Uniform, so lose on some of the nurses, was  tight on her.It highlighted her ass, and her  other assets, too.Even loose green scrubs couldn't hide those breasts, spraining at the  fabric like they wanted to break free.Steven licked his lips and rubbed his ha nds together.Women like his hands, they  said.And men.He made more money than a ll the other masseuses at the Polo Club, tips  from people who appreciated his hands."Hey," he hissed, and got her attention.She looked him up and down, taking in  how his shirt strained over his sculptured abs, how the front of his tight jeans bulged,  how his hair hung sexily over his eyes.She smiled, those sexy eyes sparkled, those rosy lips pouted."I saw you at the  hospital," she said."You came to see Mr.Lucent. ""Excellent memory," he congratulated.He knew his smile, lit up dark brown his  eyes, accented his tanned cheekbones."Like the rest of you. "She blushed, and the warm rush of color colored her face and neck and on down  into her cleavage.His eyes followed where it lead, and she saw  him staring down her  shirt.She seemed to like it."Buy me a drink?"Bars this close to the hospital had people drinking to forget what horrible  sicknesses their loved ones had been sitting in them.They weren't very good places to  start romances.So after one drink, Stephen queried, "Let's go somewhere else.This place  is depressing!""It's raining outside," she moved closer to him, like he could keep her warm in the  rain."I'll keep you warm," he promised.That's what she wants to hear!She leaned closer on the bar stool.He looked  around at the sad people with their drinks.But no one met his eyes, so he leaned down  and played with a piece of her sleek brown hair."I'm Steven," he explained.After a little while, when she didn't say anything."Do you ever try to forget things, Steven" the sexy nurse asked him?"All the time.But I didn't forget you.You are not forgettable. "She turned her head around and smiled at him.That smile made her look younger,  like she was a teenager.It was pretty, with   straight white teeth.She didn't wear much  lipstick, but he liked it that way.Probably for her job."I'm Margaret.I didn't forget you,  either.Even though, it was days ago, at the hospital.You are easy to remember.
