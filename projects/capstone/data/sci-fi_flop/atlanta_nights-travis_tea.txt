       Pain.

       Whispering voices.

       Pain.

       Pain. Pain. Pain.

       Need pee--new pain--what are they sticking in me? . . .

       Sleep.

       Pain.

       Whispering voices.

       As you know, Nurse Eastman, the government spooks controlling this hospital

will not permit me to give this patient the care I think he needs.

       Yes, doctor.  The voice was breathy, sweet, so sweet and sexy.
       We will therefore just monitor his sign    s.  Serious trauma like this patient

suffered requires extra care, but the rich patsies controlling the hospital will make certain

I cannot try any of my new treatments on him.

       Yes, doctor.  That voice was soooo sexy!

       Bruce didnt care about treatments.  He car ed about pain, and he cared about that

voice, because when he heard the voice, the pain went away, just for a few seconds, like.

       Report to me if there is any change, the mans voice said.

       Yes, Dr. Nance, said the sexy voice.

       A door closed, and Bruce heard breathing, and smelled the enticing smell of

shampoo, and perfume.  It was Chanel Number 5.

       He opened his eyes.

       All he saw was the roundest, firmest pair of  tittles he’d ever seen in his life, all

enclosed in a crisp white nurses uniform.

       Im in heaven, he said.  No, he tried to say, but his voice wouldnt work, his

mouth was dry, and there was some terrible tube thing in his noseand hey, whats that

thing in his dick?  It hurts!

       The tits bounced like Aunt Alices molded jello back at home, and then moved

away.  Oh.  She was just straightening the covers on the bed.

       Bed.

       Bruce realized he laid in a bed, his left arm being strapped down, with something

sticking an up-a tube--on the top of his hand.
Bruce looked up.  The tits belonged to a beau  tiful face carved out of ice and whipped

cream, with a pair of glowing emerald ey  es.  Around that perfect face was brown hair

like one of those super models, all puffed up.

       Oh, youre awake, Mr. Lucent, said the sexy nurse.

       Bruce worked his lips, but couldnt speak.

       Well, Mr. Lucent, the sexy voice went  on.  You are probably wondering what

you are doing here, honey chile.  He realized the voice had the accent of a sexy

Southern peach.  You were in an auto accident, Mr. Lucent, but dont worry.  Youll be

jess fine.  This here is the finest hospital in  Atlanta, and you are in the care of the finest

doctor, Dr. Arthur Eastman.

       Bruce tried to speak, but just moaned.

       Now, is there anything I can get you?  Nurse Eastman asked, moving around to

the other sides of the bed, and fluffing the pillow.

       Bruce wanted to feel those titties, that was what he wanted.  Not that he could do

much else, he realized.  Everything hurt, right  down to that thing, whatever it was, in his

dick.

       "Uh, he said.

       Nurse Eastmans eyes lit up like Christma s tree lights.  Now youre talking!

Oh, she gave a girlish giggle.  You are    recovering jess fine!  I have to go tell Dr.

Eastman, right away.

       Wait . . . he grated.
       She paused, giggling again.  A frighten  ed giggle now.  A childish giggle.  As

though a little girl on Halloween, going door to  door, instead of seeing a paper Mackay

witch or goblin suddenly was grabbed by the real thing.

       I dont remember . . . Bruce croaked.  I dont remember!

       No, she said, shaking her head vehemently.  You dont remember a thing.

Now, you jess rest!

       She went to the door, her hips swaying like palm trees in a Hawaiian hurricane.

       Bruce lied there in the bed, trying to recover his memory.  All he could remember

was the screeching of tires', like a steam engi ne gone crazy, and then there was just all

that pain.  Hell.  Hell on wheels, thats what it was, yeses.

       Hell.

       On wheels.

                                          * * *

       While outside the door, Nurse Eastman lean ed against the wall, her breasts rising

and falling with passion as she tried to control her gasps.  Oh no, she thought.  How

could it be?  Out of all the hospitals in Georgia, they would bring him here.

       She raised shaking fingers and outlined the shape of her lips, moaning softly as

she remembered the one day shed met Bruce Lucent.  The single day, at the high school

prom.  Shed gone with her cousin to please their parents, since his date got sick and he

had rented his tux and everything, even t hough she was in nursing college.  Enchantment

Under the Sea, it was called . . . she could remember it as if it was yesterday . . . their eye

met across the room, locked, held, molding pa ssionately.  It was a gaze of molten heat, a

supernova of total lust, even though he was only seventeen and she was twenty-three.
       It was only a matter of time before she d itched her cousin and Bruce ditched his

date, and they found themselves in the back of Bruces Chevy . . .

       She moaned, writhing in memory, until a voice splintered, shattered, pierced her

memory.  Nurse Eastman!

       It was the Head Nurse!  Her warty nose  quivered, her eyes blazed with suspicion.

The old bag!  She wouldnt know what true love really was.

       I'm sorry, Margaret Eastman smiled.  I just had a cramp.

       If you are sick, you may be excused from your shift, the Head Nurse opined.

       II will be fine.  But I promised Dr  . Nance I would let him know when his

patient woke up, Margaret gritted, and ran aw ay before the Head Nurse could stop her,

her high heels clattering on the floor like the death knells of doom.

       Doctor Arthur Nance looked up when the nurse entered the room.

       Arthur had always been the brightest star  at school, from a very early age.  He

was always elected class president in  grammar school, middle school, and high school.

He was Class Valedictorian at his graduati  on, and when a lot of his friends went to

mechanic school, or junior college to mess ar ound with business, he went straight to the

university medical school.

       But their Arthur ran into something     far worse than tough teachers or tough

grades: prejudice.  Yes, prejudice.  Not race,  but class.  All the snobs from the wealthy

families laughed at him for his accent, and    when he tried to join the most popular

fraternities on campus, they hazed him wit  hout letting him know until too late that he

would never join.
       Arthur got his medical degree, but he became embittered, against rich people, and

politicians, and anyone in authority.  Whereev er he went, he was sure there was some

conspiracy against him, by those in authority.

       He was sure of it when he didnt get hi     red to any private hospitals, or to a

lucrative practice among the rich, doing fat re moval and face-lifts for twenty-five grand

apiece.  No, he could only get a job in th  is hellhole, where every night the ambulances

brought in drunks and suicides and crazily homeless and the battered wrecks the EMTs

scraped off the freeways.

       Like this Lucent jerk.

       Arthur was sitting there brooding about all these ills when Nurse Eastman came

into the doctor room.

       Is my patient awake? he asked.

       Yes, she said, and then she wiped her  eyes and throatily whispered, Doctor, I

have to request that you excuse me from attending to this patient.

       Request denied, Dr. Nance said curtly.   I will not have one of those braided

spies who work for the hospital trustees k  illing my patient!  Ill go sees he now, he

stormed, and stormed out of the room.

       Margaret leaned against the wall and wept a sorrowing floodlike of tears.

       She knew Bruce would emerge from the        fog of the painkillers and he would

recognize her.  What if he told someone about that night at the prom?

       All her life Margaret had worked hard, harder than anyone else.  Her sisters, all of

them far more beautiful than she, had coasted through life like a toboggan down the snow

hill of life.  But Margaret had a vision at an  early age, and knew she was meant to be a
nurse.  Her mother had scorned her.  Her father had laughed at her.  So she put herself

through nursing school by waiting tables at a lo  w dive at night.  Five long years she

toiled, with never a day off, not even at Chri  stmas, just so she could walk out with her

head held high, and her degree in her hand.

       Once, just once, she had strayed from the  path of hard work.  Just once shed let

herself relax.  Do her cousin Ted a favor.  Go as his date to the prom.

       Well, shed learned her lessonshe thought .  She never thought shed see Bruce

Lucent again, but now, here, the  cruelty of the fates laughed at her, just like her family.

Bruce Lucent was here, helpless, in her hospital, and it was only a matter of time before

he remembered who she was, and what would he do then?

       She wept even harder.
                                        

       The Atlanta sun slanted low in the west, rain showers predicted for later that

afternoon, then clearing.  Bruce Lucent looked from the side window of his friend's shiny

Maserati sports car as they wheeled their way westward against the afternoon traffic.

       "I'm glad you could give me a ride,"  Bruce Lucent muttered, his pain-worn face

reddened by the yellow sunlight.  "What with my new car all smashed and all."

       His old friend, Isadore, shook his massive head at him.  "We know how it must be

to have a lot of money but no working car," he said, the harsh Macon County drawl of his

voice softened by his years in Atlanta high society.  "It's my pleasure to bring you back to

your fancy apartment, and we're all so happy that y'all is still alive.  Y'all could have been

killed in that dreadful wreck."  Isadore paus ed to put on the turn signal before making a

safe turn across rush-hour traffic into the  parking lot of Bruce Lucent's luxury apartment

building.  "Y'all'll gets a new car on Monday."

       "I don't know how I'll be able to drive it   with my arm in a cast," Bruce Lucent

shoots back.  "It's lucky I wasn't killed out right like so many people are when they have

horrid automobile wrecks."

       "Fortunately, fast and efficient Emergency Medical Services, based on a program

founded by Lyndon Baines Johnson the 36th President of the United States helped y'all
survive an otherwise, deadly crash," Isadore chuckled.  He nodded his head toward the

towering apartment building, in the very shadow of Peachtree Avenue, where Bruce lived

his luxurious life.  So young, yet so wealthy,   based on his skills as an expert software

developer.

       "I don't feel very fortunate," Bruce compla ined as his friend helped him from the

low-slung red car, "I hurt all over and I don't remember a thing after I left that bar over

on Martin Avenue.  I wouldn't be surprised if the police didn't want to talk to me about

what happened.  Not that I could help them because I don't remember anything" he added

as an afterthought.

       Isadore pulled the collapsible wheelchair that he'd bought at Saint Irene's Hospital

from the open trunk of his new Maserati and  unfolded it on the curb beside where Bruce

painfully stood, his recent ordeal only recently over.  He helped his chum sit in the new

wheelchair, and then pushed it rapidly toward  the gleaming doors of the high-rise tower.

The soft Southern breeze blew the sweet scent of magnolias over them as he said, "This

is certainly something new for me."

       "Never say that," he replied.

       Isadore shook his head, his red ponytail flipping in the soft breeze, as he wheeled

his best friend into the lobby, past the uni formed security guard named Amos who

saluted them and then into the elevator to   the fourteenth floor of the luxury high-rise

apartment building, recently built in downtown Atlanta.

       The longtime security guard saluted the pair as they passed.  What lucky people,

he thought, so young and rich, they can afford to live here.  Not like me.  I have to live
across town and wear a uniform and salute the young rich kids who make more money in

a minute than I can make in my whole life.

       Bruce thought that the dark elevator walls  were closing in on him and despite the

chill in the air-conditioned air he could still smell the flower smells from outside.  The

upward elevator started slowly into motion  as if it was reluctance to climb the hundreds

of feet.  "Hurry up," Bruce cried aloud.

       Bruce pounded on the arm of his recently acquired wheelchair as his friend asked

"Bruce, what's the matter?  Is y'all so impatient to get home that the elevator is too slow

for you?  Imagine if y'all had to take     the emergency stares in your condition" he

chuckled.

       Bruce glared at his friend who stood behind him and the wheelchair as the

elevator hissed to a halt on the fourteenth floor, the dark paneled doors sliding open with

the sound of well-oiled machinery, and then he  was pushed by his friend out into the hall

and then down to the door labeled 1414, his apartment door.

       Bruce searched his pockets for the key that he knew he did not have.  "Dammit,"

he said, and then, "They kept everything even  my wallet at the hospital, how am I going

to get it?"

       Isadore knocked once at the door, and then it at once swung open.  The stunning

vision inside, an echo of pulchritude in a bright red dress, seemed to take their breath

away, it was Penelope Urbain, Bruce Lucent's longtime and very beautiful girlfriends.

Penelope, who had walked in the door of  Lucent Software, asking for a job, and a good

thing is being that she did, because he had one  for her, a position, so to speak, that only a

beautiful woman could fulfill, and she filled the role perfectly, as the beautiful girlfriend
for those social occasions when he needed to  appear on the front page of the newspaper

with a beautiful woman on his arm.  Ever yone looked and thought he was lucky, but it

wasn't just luck it was planning that he fell   in love with this beautiful woman and her

with him.  He gave her his glance and she gave him hers.

       Bruce looked at her and whistled, thanki ng whatever god was listening that the

auto accident that he had apparently been in  had spared his family jewels for he wasn't

one to put to pasture his rampant desire  for his stunning young woman, at least not yet.

He snapped his fingers and snarled, "Take me   inside, Isadore, or you're fired from my

software company."

       Something like anger stirred in Isadore's breast, yet Isadore laughed at Bruce's

favorite joke as he pushed the millionaire    software developer indoctrinated by New

Agers into the stunning studio apartment that he  rented in this exclusive high-rise tower.

The walls were white as was the carpet.  The walls met the ceiling at right angles, where

glistening mirrors in gold frames studded the walls.

       Penelope Urbain had been a poor girl   she knew, though she pretended to have

grown up rich and happy in the suburbs of A tlanta it was all a lie.  Now she looked into

one of the many mirrors on that studded the walls of her boyfriend Bruce's apartment and

liked what she saw.  Two hazel eyes with  perky eyebrows, red like the hair of her head

and other places, met her smoky gaze in the mirror.  She smoothed the hair back from her

elfin ears, making it tumble down her back, pa st her shoulders, broad but not too broad,

broad enough to support the luxurious breasts that filled the front of her scarlet sun dress,

glowing in the afternoon sun, the hot Georgi a orb of fire, that came through the window,
as she admired her trim shape and flat tu mmy, in the mirror.  She looked, she thought,

like the bad-girl heroine of a tawdry romance novel.

       The expensive shoes she wore, high heels that matched her tight dress, and set off

her red hair, were delicately shaped by the s tiletto heels and sharp toes, the lift they gave

curving her creamy calves and making her rounded bottom move like a semaphore of

love as she walked past the framed mirror  that she had been looking in.  Her hazel eyes

sparkled as she took in the sight of her ne  wly-returned boyfriend in the wheeled chair

that marked him some disabled person.

       "Would you like a drinkie?" Penelope offere d her recently returned beau as his

friend pushed him in front of the wide-screen  TV that dominated the west wall without

making it seem overpowering.

       "Dammit, yes," Bruce Lucent repeated, looki ng at this vision of feminine lust on

two feet, "I've been in the lousy hospital a nd they don't let you have a little drink there,"

he opined.  "Then I want to get to my new computer so I can check on my hot stock

options and write more on my best-selling soft ware development.  I've wasted too much

time locked in that smelly hospital.  It's full of sick, people."  Penelope and Isadore

looked at each other, as only two redheads   can look at one another as Bruce delivered

himself of this comment.

       "Then let me fix you something nice w  ithexpensive vodka and gin," Penelope

giggled, as she went to the kitchen to ma  ke ice cubes.  When she was young, she had

been called Penny, but now she was worth a lot more she mused, as she busied herself at

the full bar that filled the west wall beside  the large television set that Bruce had bought
with the first proceeds of his award-winning   mutual software.  He often went on the

modern Internet, to make his money.

       "And when Isadore's gone I can greet you  properly," Penelope whispered as she

handed the Old Fashioned to Bruce in his chrome wheelchair.  She looked significantly at

Bruce's tanned, lean frame as she handed him the crystal glass.  "Yeah," Bruce responded

"What's he still doing hear?"  He turned to  his old friend and pointed out, "Whys don't

you go park the car?  My old car is crashed.  You know."

       "Yes, Bruce," Isadore smirked, as he turned, knowing what kind of scene of wild

debauchery was about to be enacted in th   at very room, because he had known it for

himself first hand during the long week Bruce  Lucent had been in the hospital.  "I'll go

park the car."

       He went down the sleek elevator that      he had so shortly before ascended,

wondering if Bruce was going to be the man  he had been, before losing consciousness in

that horrible accident.  Then the gleaming l obby doors were before him.  He planned to

take the Maserati out onto Peachtree Avenue   in search of an empty parking place as

upstairs a miracle of love was performed   by Penelope and Bruce, young lovers at the

very height of their beauty, wealth, power, desire.

       "Going down," Isadore Trent chuckled as he pressed the down button, and

laughing at his own joke.  Had he but known what was to come he would have been

laughing out of the other side of his mouth.
                                    

       As you've probably heard Yvonne, began  Penelope Urbain. Seriously brushing

a gleaming scarlet tress out of her tearful eye Bruce has come home from the hospital

after his accident.

       Yes you must be very happy, said Yvonne sympathetically. He was badly hurt

in that auto accident.

       Yes he was badly hurt, responded Penelope honestly. But he is home now and

I am very happy about that.

       We need to have a very serious discussion about this, said Yvonne earnestly.

       Yes. We have some very serious things to discuss, agreed Penelope.

       Yvonne Perrin raised her glass and began to gulp down the martini she had

ordered and then she signaled the waiter to bring another one. Yvonne drank too much
and did not eat right at all and Penelope was starting to get worried about her friend's

habits in eating and drinking. Her cheeks were  almost as red as her hair already, like red

Delicious apples under green leaves which were her eyes and the dark pupils were like

little curled up caterpillars in the middle.

       Do you think it is a good idea to have another 1 Yvonne? interrogated

Penelope.

       Yes one more will not hurt me and then I will quit, retorted Yvonne.

       They did not notice that Steven Suffern was watching them secretly from his table

across the dining room. They were at the Polo  Club for lunch. The restaurant was a large

room with a number of tables and some  big windows looking out over the golf course

and the lake. Both men and women and couples were eating lunch. Steven Suffern was

the best masseuse the Club had ever had. After lunch Yvonne might get a massage. She

thought he was a stud. Watching him across the room, with rippling muscles like a bull

and well hung too. She could see his pulsing   manhood stuffed into the tight silky blue

gym shorts he always wore at work. She  thought she should have made an appointment

for a massage.

       Steven Suffern thought Penelope was a   real looker far too good for that stuffy

software developer, Lucent who needed to work out once in a while and lose fifty

pounds. He flexed his muscles and thought about the book he had just read, The Joy of

Sex. It always surprised people that this athletic man was such a great reader and he liked

that.

       Hello ladies, said Steven Suffern passing their table.
       Hello Steven. Purred Yvonne. She had a crush on the handsome masseuse at the

Polo Club. Sometimes she saw him working out in the gym and she was turned on by the

sweat smell of his sweet. She could not wait to think of a plan to try to get him into bed

with her.

       Hello Steven. Penelope whispered softly.

       Do you have to work today? Maybe we  could get a massage later, said Yvonne

boldly.

       I only have room in my appointment book for one lady this afternoon,"

explained Steven.

       Oh that is all right. You go Yvonne, said Penelope kindly.

       She knew her friend had a crush on Steven who was a real stud.

        I must get back to Bruce anyway.  He needs me.

       Steven would have liked to give her a  massage but he was stuck with her friend.

Yvonne was too old for him. He stood up and walked past their table and flexed a bicep

for effect. See you later then Yvonne, he said meaningfully.

       Yvonne watched him go by his muscles  pulsing and rippling like waves under a

thin blanket of tanned skin like a freshly baked cinnamon cake. Penelope began to sip her

mint julep. I think he likes you Yvonne, said Penelope thoughtfully.

       Why do you think that Penelope? asked Yvonne Urbain.

       He always comes over to talk to us when we are eating lunch at the Polo Club,

explained Penelope. He is cute, I think so too. But I have Bruce already.

       I think you are the main attraction here for him not I! hissed Yvonne jealously.
       No, I am not, soothed Penelope. Anyway you can get a massage and have him

to yourself I will go home and take care of Bruce.

       The waiter walked over to their table and brought another martini for Yvonne

with a shot glass of extra vodka on the side.

       I did not order extra vodka! Said Yvonne impatiently. She was mad from the

conversation with her friend Penelope who all the men seemed to be attracted to. Her

cheeks were flaming red fires like a volcano  ready to explode through the cold emerald

stones that were her eyes. She knew Penelope thought she drank too much.

       The waiter said I am sorry Miss but we  are out of cocktail onions and the chef

sent this instead with his complements.

       Yvonne Perrin stood up and walked over to the waiter and took the shot glass full

of vodka and poured it out in a planter that  held a spindly rubber tree that never got

enough light to grow properly even though it  was near one of the windows that looked

out onto the lake where some ducks were floating like they were waiting for someone to

throw them some bread but there was nobody there at this time of day.

       Calm down.  Yvonne people are staring at  you, said Penelope worriedly. Do

you feel ok? she asked questioningly.

       You never understand how I feel. moaned Yvonne. I am just as good looking

as you but I am older that is not fair. The men all go for you and you have Bruce already.

I am afraid I will never find a man now that I am getting old.

       Yvonne sipped her martini which tasted  like liquid ice on her tongue. It helped

her feel calmer. She asked the waiter What brand of vodka is in this drink?
       It is a French vodka imported specially  for the Polo Club. Thinking that ought

to impress her and picking up the empty glasses from their table. Do you want to order

something to eat now?

       Yes. I will have steak, said Penelope decisively. And I want it cooked rarely. I

am a gourmet when it comes to beef so tell the cook not to overcook it."

       Yes Ma'am. The waiter said smoothly. Anything else? he added.

       French Fries and please bring the horseradish sauce.

       A Caesar salad for me with blue cheese dressing. Yvonne decided. I am

watching my weight.

       Leave room for the desert. It is our chef special today, suggested the waiter.

       Yvonne could see the people at the next  table eating chocolate cake. Everybody

else had finished their lunch and gone now from the empty room. Yes pleased, she said

eagerly. She had gotten over her fit about the extra vodka.

       The waiter walked away.

       Now back to talking about Bruce, said Penelope Urbain brushing a strand of red

hair out of her eyes. I hope he will recover soon from his accident.

       Do not worry about that, exclaimed Yvonne. He is getting.  The finest medical

care money can buy. And if the accident leaves a scar he can go to a plastic surgeon and

has it removed. I know a very good plastic surgeon in Atlanta. He did my nose for me

last year, she argued.

       Penelope wiped a teardrop from the corner  of her lovely almond-shaped eyes. I

do not know what I would do without Bruce      if something happened to him. You say
Steven Suffern likes me but I do not think I could go for a masseuse if something

happened and Bruce dies.

       Yvonne Perrin got angry. You are a snob, Penelope Urbain. She shouted

angrily. The crowd of people eating in the restaurant at the Polo Club put down their

knives and forks and stared at them.

       I am not, retorted Penelope in reply.

       You do not deserve the love of a man like  Bruce Lucent. He is the absolute most

eligible bachelors in Atlanta. And another one is Steven Suffern, Yvonne pointed out

heatedly.

       We have been friends for a long time. Penelope said wistfully. I do not want us

to fight over men.

       You are right, sighed Yvonne. Let us not  talk about this again. Waving her

hand to attract the waiter. I will pay for lunch today.

       The waiter stated Yes misses what would you like?

       I would like the bill, said Yvonne firmly.

       That will be one hundred and thirty-four dollars plus tax responded the waiter.

       Put it on my tab I am a member of the Polo Club, said Yvonne grandly.

       Penelope knew she could not afford a bill like that but she had her pride. She

could not show her up before all the best society in Atlanta. She would never forgive her

if she did. I would be glad  to pay half. She offered gently. But her friend waved the

money away and stood up and began to walk to the door.

       I will make up for it when I get that     massage from Steven Suffern. She

exclaimed. Steven is a real stud and I am looking forward to it! She added eagerly.
       Yvonne could not do anything more. She decided to go home and sees Bruce. But

she was glad they had such a good discussion and cleared up things between them.
                                        

       Andrew Venice parked his car on the street in front of the house and double-

checked the address he had written down on a slip of paper.  Yeah, this was the place all

right.  It was an ordinary house, on an ordinary street.  There was nothing special about

it, just plain.  Nothing here looked like it might be connected to murder or assault or

anything like that.  Richard Isaacs, the man     he’d come to interview, were a stock

manipulator, and youd think hed live in a fancier place, a nicer house, on a better street.

But since he was also a police informant, maybe he wanted to keep a low profile, not do

anything to stand out.  Not exactly like the witnesses' protection program, but not all that

different.  Or maybe he just wasnt that good at manipulating stocks.  Venice would try to

find out, in addition to finding out what he really came here to ask about.
       He put the note on the front seat, and hi  s sunglasses in the glove compartment,

checking his reflection in the rearview mirror and smoothing back his hair.  Turning forty

was hard.  He didnt know what hed been planning to do at forty, but he was damn sure

this wasnt it.  Oh well.  It was his job, and he was the one to do it.  Hed better get going,

ask his questions, make his report.  Then hed have time to stop by the gym later, work

out a bit, fight off the ravages of time.  He was still in his prime, even if he had to work

harder to maintain it.

       Getting out of the car, he looked both ways, then shut the door and used the key

fob to lock all the doors.  It wasnt a bad neighborhood or anything like that, but he still

didnt want to take any chances.  He let a minivan go past, then an SUV, then he walked

around the front of his car and up the long sidewalk to the porch.  A bench sat on the

porch, the kind you might sit on and drink some lemonade, but it didnt look used, like

nobody had had any lemonade to drink there for a while, or maybe they just didnt like

the porch or something.  Isaacs probably had  to keep a low profile anyway.  He wasnt

the kind of guy who spent a lot of time outside making friends with the neighbors.

       Venice went to knock on the door and stopped.  There was a flyer lying on the

welcome mat.  No, it was one of those bags   of advertisements they paid neighborhood

kids to deliver, one of those circulars.  there was a cardboard box full of them just off to

the side of the door.  He picked up the new  one and held it in his hand as he knocked on

the door with his knuckles, loud enough so       anyone inside could hear him but not

pounding or anything like that.  Watching his  reflection in the storm door, smoothing the

lapels on his suit jacket so hed be sure to look nice, the door opened.
       Richard Isaacs were the man who answered the door.  He looked over Venice

wondering who this guy was at  his door, and what he was doing there.  Venice got into

his pocket and pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to a show hid badge.

       Hi, my name is Andrew Venice, he said cheerfully, like there was nothing

unusual about him showing up there in the middle of the day.  Im here to ask you a few

questions.  Its no big deal.

       That was just what Venice wanted him to think, Isaacs thought.  They always said

it was no big deal when they were trying to nail you.

       I found this lying outside your door, Andrew said.  You want it?

       What was this guy trying to do, being friendly to him?  No, just toss it there into

the circular file, Isaacs pointed.

       Toss it into where?

       That box right there beside the door,    he said, pointed to the box.  He was

getting mad.

       Its not a circle, its more of a square, said Venice.  Or a rectangle maybe.

       Its a joke, all right?  Now Issacs was really really mad.  I put the circulars in

the circular file.

       But that crazy Venice guy just offered it again.  You sure you dont want it.

They got good deals inside, could save you some money.

       Just throw it away.  I wish the kids would stop delivering them.

       Hey, listen, said Venice, sticking his hands into his pockets.  I dont have all

day here.  Im on an investigation.  I came   to ask you some important questions, and I

want some answers.
       I dont have to answer anything you ask!  Richard Isaacs replied forcefully.  He

wanted to make a point.  Are you going to st ay out there on the porch and scare off all

the neighbors or you going to come inside?

       Ill come inside and ask you my questions there.  I want to ask you about

Margaret Eastman.

       Issacs knew he was going to be regretting this later.  But he said, Come on

inside anyway.  Even though he didnt want the guy inside.  But what were you going to

do?  Thats what they expected from you once you got messed up with the police.  But he

didnt have to play their game.

       Venice walked into the living room, not  sure what to expect.  Something about

Isaacs didnt add up right.  Either he was living in a plain house in this plain

neighborhood because of frugality, because he     was cheap, or there was some other

reason.  He couldnt figure Isaacs out, like   there was something he was hiding.  Even

though Venice knew he was in his mid60s, he looked more like a tough guy than a stock

market expert.  He had broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, muscular.  His cheeks were

ruddy like he spent a lot of time outside in  the sun and the wind.  Damn genetics.  Some

people didnt have to work for anything and  had it all anyway.  He didnt look like a guy

who had just turned 40 and needed Viagra to  get it up anymore.  But Venice wasnt here

to feel sorry for himself.  He had a job to do.  And it was time to do it.

       Isaacs sat down in the brown reclining chai r with a plop, in front of the bigscreen

TV, and he pointed to the couch.  Why  dont you sit down, he suggested, like a man

who meant it?
       Venice wasnt going to let himself be pushed around that way by some informant.

I think Ill stand.  Thisll just take a few minutes.

       So get started already!  Isaacs would be glad when this interview was over so

he could watch his football game.  You follow the Falcons at all?

       Im not really a football fan, said   Venice, although he split a pair of season

tickets with his brother-in-law, went to half the games.  He looked at the TV for a second,

trying to spot Bill in the crowd.  Bill was married to his little sister, Leslie, he adored

Leslie.  Bill was a great guy, just the kind of  guy hed rather be spending the afternoon

with.  Then he thought he sounded like some  wuss for saying that, so he added, I think

the West Coast offense really ought to open things up for Vick though.  They should

make the playoffs next year.

       Yeah, said Isaacs, passionately.  He loved football.  He didnt mind all the

damn questions now so much, not if this Venice character liked the Falcons.  So you

wanted to ask me about somebody, some Mary, Maury . . . 

       Her name is Margaret Eastman, Venice   said.  His veins turned to ice at the

mention of her name.  Things like that shouldnt happen to a young woman like her.

       Who is she?  Issacs asked.

       Yeah! Who is she?  The door to the kitchen slammed open and in walked the

most beautiful woman Venice had seen today,  or maybe in a week.  The more he looked

at her, more he thought maybe in a lifetime, but he didnt have a whole lifetime of

experience yet.  But she was incredibly beautiful.  Her eyes burst with curiosity.  Or

maybe it was jealousy.  She was older, for a beautiful woman, maybe 40, maybe the exact

same age as Venice.  She was wearing a bra under her tight blouse and she was wearing
lipstick too, and he couldnt help staring at her.  Her hair was pretty too, like it was made

out of silk, just that kind of shiny.

       Hey Monica, we need some privacy to  discuss business, says Isaacs. Its just

man talk, nothing youd be interested in.

       If its another woman again, you bet Im     interested, she said, adjusting her

breasts to make them stick out more.  Venice  was still staring at her, he couldnt take his

eyes off her, and she was looking at his eyes , like she was touching herself for him, to be

prettier for him.  He couldnt believe it.

       I dont know who she is, Issacs said,  and he was regretting inviting Venice into

the house again.

       You sure you dont know anything about her? Venice asked.

       Monica stared at him with her lips making a little red pout.  If I knew anything

about her, you can bet Id let you know, she said, slapping Issacs on the top of his head.

       Ow! he said, grabbing the top of his head.

       He looked at Venice again and said I  said I dont know her or anything about

her.

       She was the nurse at the hospital where Bruce Lucent recovered from his

automobile accident, Venice said.  Shes really beautiful, like you wouldnt believe.

She has brown hair.

       I know you like women with brown hair  , you two-timing jerks, Monica said,

she was hitting Isaacs on the top of his head again, and he jumped up and yelled.

       Stop that, I said I dont know anything, and I dont know her!
       I could show you pictures, Venice said.   He had a lot of pictures of her, but he

didnt want to share all of them, not with this scum.  It might help your memory some.

       Listen, buddies, Isaacs said.  You came here, so you take what you get and

leave.  I said I dont know anything, I dont know nothing, thats all there is to it.

       Why dont you take me? Monica purred at him.

       Hey now, I dont like that, Isaacs said, and now he was mad at all of them for

ruining his day.  He was mad enough to hurt somebody.  Hed killed a man before one

time, with his bare hands, and he could do it  again, if he put something in his bare hands

like a knife or a gun or something that he could kill somebody with.

       Venice sensed trouble ahead, but he wanted to see more of Monica.  He had the

sense though that they were just ships passing in the night, that she was just some

temporary liaison of Richard Isaacs, probably just another cheap tramp or something like

all the others.  Maybe she could be different, but it wasnt going to be in this lifetime, not

with him.

       Well, if you dont know anything, I guess Ill be going, he said.

       Walking down the sidewalk, the car waited for him at the curb.  He stopped

before opening the door and looked back up at the house.  He saw Isaacs standing in the

window frame looking back at him.  Some body was hiding something here, but Venice

knew he was a bulldog.  Hed get to the bottom of it yet.

       And it didnt matter who got hurt along the way, cause he was going to find out

the answers.
                                     

       There she was, the pretty nurse Steven had seen while he was visiting Bruce

Lucent in the hospital. It had just been luck, because he'd stepped out of Bruce's hospital

room, thinking about Bruce's ass--a nice, tight ass--when he'd seen her. Her hospital

Uniform, so lose on some of the nurses, was  tight on her. It highlighted her ass, and her

other assets, too. Even loose green scrubs couldn't hide those breasts, spraining at the

fabric like they wanted to break free.

       Steven licked his lips and rubbed his ha nds together. Women like his hands, they

said. And men. He made more money than a ll the other masseuses at the Polo Club, tips

from people who appreciated his hands.
       "Hey," he hissed, and got her attention. She looked him up and down, taking in

how his shirt strained over his sculptured abs, how the front of his tight jeans bulged,

how his hair hung sexily over his eyes.

       She smiled, those sexy eyes sparkled, those rosy lips pouted. "I saw you at the

hospital," she said. "You came to see Mr. Lucent."

       "Excellent memory," he congratulated. He knew his smile, lit up dark-brown his

eyes, accented his tanned cheekbones. "Like the rest of you."

       She blushed, and the warm rush of color colored her face and neck and on down

into her cleavage. His eyes followed where it lead, and she saw  him staring down her

shirt. She seemed to like it. "Buy me a drink?"

       Bars this close to the hospital had people drinking to forget what horrible

sicknesses their loved ones had been sitting in them. They weren't very good places to

start romances. So after one drink, Stephen queried, "Let's go somewhere else. This place

is depressing!"

       "It's raining outside," she moved closer to him, like he could keep her warm in the

rain. "I'll keep you warm," he promised.

       That's what she wants to hear! She leaned closer on the bar stool. He looked

around at the sad people with their drinks. But no one met his eyes, so he leaned down

and played with a piece of her sleek brown hair.

       "I'm Steven," he explained. After a little while, when she didn't say anything.

       "Do you ever try to forget things, Steven" the sexy nurse asked him?

       "All the time. But I didn't forget you. You are not forgettable."
       She turned her head around and smiled at him. That smile made her look younger,

like she was a teenager. It was pretty, with   straight white teeth. She didn't wear much

lipstick, but he liked it that way. Probably for her job. "I'm Margaret. I didn't forget you,

either. Even though, it was days ago, at the hospital. You are easy to remember."

       He smiled lazily at her, glad that he  worked out, because it must be his abs and

his muscles that made him so easy to remember.

       Their faces got closer together. He was  looking at her in the dim light from the

bar, ignoring the jangling music. It was noisy  in here, and stank of beer and other things

he didn't want to think about. So he thought  about her. Looking down at her like this, her

shirt gapped open more, and he could see the  top of her bra. Those big, jiggle breasts, so

close to him. They were making his jeans uncomfortable.

       "Let's forget what you want to a fogey, then, "Steven encouraged. She smiled a

little bit, and those rosy red lips parted. Her   teeth shone like perfect pearls in the dim

light. He wanted to taste those lips. She closed her eyes and tipped her head back some

more. That was his cue, he could tell. So he pushed his lips against hers.

       Her lips were warm and soft and tasted like breath mints. It was good. She sighed

a little bit, and he thought she would pull away  then, but she didn't. So he made the kiss

better. He ran his tongue along those perfect  teeth. The feeling made him more sure he

wanted to get her out of this bar.

       "This isn't a very good place to kiss," he stated.

       "But it was a very good kiss." She exclaimed dreamily!

       He paid the bill, then put his sweater  around Margaret's shoulders. Wait her," he

mentioned meaningfully. "Ill bring my car around."
       His Miata, bright red like her lips, sparkled with raindrops like diamonds in the

light from the streetlights. Margaret giggled  whilst he held the sweater over her head and

led her out to the car. "Climb in, fair princess," He chuckled, holding the door, open.

       Soon that sexy nurse, was sitting close to him on his sculpted, dark-blue velvet

sofa. The lava lamp glowed on her face. Blues made her look mysterious. Reds shouted

"Sex!" Her eyes were deep pools of mystery.

       He put in a DVD that his last girlfriend had said was sexy.

The music filled the room with drumbeats like heartbeats, and a rhythm like to people

humping.

       "Let me give you a massage" he said. "I give really good massages!"

       "Im waiting." She turned her back to him, and he laid his hands on that sexily

slender neck. "I need to pull your shirt up." "Mmm hmm!"

       He started to massage the tight muscles   of her back. She was so tense, but he

could fix that. A little oil. Patchouli. Down to her slender waist, then her voluptuous hips.

Ease tension, and he could smell her reaction, even over the oil. Yes, she was ready. He

turned her over, massaged those breasts, D cups at least, with his sc3ented fingers. Did he

take off her bra? Did she? And who undid her skirt? All he knew was that her muscles

softened and her tension went away under his skilled fingers, and then her muscles

tightened again as she pulled frantically at the zipper of his jeans.

       That was when he pushed his fingers, into  her yielding brown hair and pulled her

face to his. Their tongues met like wild beasts, their dance ageless and timeless. "You

have a hell of a body," she exclaimed into his mouth. "So do you," he moaned. Even if

she was older than I, she was still hot.
       His raging manhood was bursting at the seams of his jeans, and so he undid the

zipper she couldn't. She was moaning, lying on   the soft velvet of the sofa, completely

abandoned to his will. As they came together, he thought how much better this woman,

who was experienced and sexy and had been  padding on all the right places was to make

love to than the teenagers who threw themselves at him for his body.

       They writhed together, like wild beasts, on the velvet, somehow moving to the

deep shag on the floor. His hands, still oily, massaged her ass as he moved inside her. She

panted, against his chest, she breathes getting more and more agitate. Steven could tell

she was really getting into this. He was turning her on. So he got faster and faster, and

finally, she screamed "Henry!" and went limp underneath him.

       Her waves of passion set off Stevens,  and her passion pumped him dry. She lay

with her head on his chest, looking up into his eyes. The light from the lava lamp was

purples and golds now. Purple and gold--the   colors of passion. It shown on her face,

damp with sweat from their wild sex. The  purple made her glazed brown hair look like

some exotic African princess, naked and willing. After a few minutes, he started again.

                                          * * *

       Steven was tired the next day, because he  and Margaret had made love more than

one time. First in the living room, then in  the bedroom, then in the bathroom in the

shower. Then he took her home, and they      had held hands like little kids and kissed

outside her door. He couldn't remember any  woman or boy as hot as she was. None of

those teen-agers had ever been like this. He defiantly wanted to see her again.

       He was giving a massage to one of the regulars at the Polo Club, and a guy named

Isaac Stevens. Steven wasn't interested in  Stevens, because the guy was too old. Besides
that, he had Margaret on his mind. But he must have yawned one too many times. "Late

night last night?" wondered Stevens. His voice was kind of muffled by the table he was

laying face down on.

       "Oh, yeah," Steven muttered dreamily. He  wished it was Margaret's back he was

massaging right now. Or maybe somebody else he  could get a quickie in with. Thinking

about Margaret was making Steven hard.

       "She must have been something, "Stevens guffawed wickedly. "Or was it a he?"

       "It was a girl, no a woman. Not just any  woman. The best I ever met," enthused

Steven.

       Stevens wriggled on the massage table.   He was probably getting hot, thinking

about Stevens' night last night. "Does she   have a name, or, are you keeping her, all to

yourself?"

       "You know those center folds of, naughty nurses? I think they're all true. That's

what she is, a nurse. At the Atlanta General hospital, right across town."

       Stevens mused, "Every time I ever went  to the hospital the nurses, would hardly

talk to me. Must be?"

       "Probably." Stevens mind was not on the conversation. It was on Margaret. He

could tell she did like his abs. And his ass, the way she had gripped it--

       "Well, does, she have a name" Stevens said one more time?

       "Oh, yes. Margaret Eastman. "He drew       the name Margaret out like a kiss.

"Maaar-gaaa-reeeet."

                                        

       Bruce rubbed the thick foam collar around his neck with his good hand. The

stupid thing itched badly and he knew it looked  darkies but the surgeon had insisted that

he must ware it constantly for the next mont h or suffer the consequence. At least it kept

his neck warm in the frigid air conditioning  in this restraint. He followed Isaac Stevens

who followed the waiter around past the side entrance and between tables and a booth at

the back. Bruce stomped his cane down on a lady's foot at one of the tables and she swore

at him: "Damn stupid gimp! Whence watch out were yes going' with that damnable

misbegotten whoreson stupid cane you a dam adjt.!"
       "Gaseous, you old bat!" he howled. "Watch your own feet and keep them out of

the way so I don't trip over them! Don't you know who I am? Give me any more trouble

and I'll have your ass arrested so far your false teeth will pop out of your head!"

       Three waiters hurried over. "I'm so sorry  Mr. lucent" they sniveled. One of them

turned on the old lady and shouted "Backs off,  you! That's Mr. Lucent and he owns half

this town!" Another waiter spoke up and yelled "Why he owns more than half of this here

Trotters Corners and that's a fact!" They  gathered around her and knocked her out of her

chair, then kicked her a few times to teach her a lesson.

       Bruce limped on after Stevens, leaving the waiters to handle the woman. It was

stupid people like that who had inspired him to climb to the top. He didn't ever want to be

stuck with riffraff like that so he had us ed the computer skills he had learned from

cracking play station games and writing viruses  on the internet to build his company to a

person was today. A giant among software de velopment companies! Not bad for a guy

just out of his teens.

       He bumped another table with the cast   on his leg but the people there cringed.

"Sorry Mr. Lucent" one declaimed "I hope that didn't hurt you."

       "No" he offered magnanimously, "I'm okay." He limped across to their booth and

slid in across from Stevens. "So, what did you want to talk to me about?" he growled.

       "Let's have a drink first and get someth ing to eat" soothed Isaac. "That dumb old

lady seems to have upset you so let's relax for a while and then we'll talk about business."

       "Suits Me Fine" offered Bruce. He turn    ed to the waiter. "I'll have a Shirley

Temple Screwdriver with absolute vodka on the rocks." "Yes sir!" exclaimed the waiter.

"And you, Mr. Stevens?"
       "Spays burn, on the rocks, with a little Pepsi. A good single-malt needs a little

sweetening."

       "I prefer Mountain Dew with my singl e-malts" quibbled Bruce. "Or maybe prune

juice. It's more natural somehow."

       "My daughter, Irene, likes it with root beer, but she's a little weird." Chuckled

Stevens. He rubbed his pepper and salt beard,  then brushed backs his close-trimmed hair.

"I heard about your accident at the Polo Cl  ub. Guesses you're lucky to be alive. Henry

Archer went off the road on the same curve a few nights later in his Humvee but he didn't

survive. The cops said someone had dumpe d a bunch of used oil on the shoulder near

there. That might have been what got you and Henry."

       "Could be? I was only doing 95 but I slid right  off when I got there. Had to throw

away the boxer shorts I was wearing. They we re nice ones, too. Glow in the dark green

with luscious red lips printed all over them. I miss those shorts" whined Bruce. He

scratched at his crotch where the leg cast rubbed and itched.

       The waiter returned with their drinks. He set them down and then set a big

foaming mug of beer in front  of each of them as well. "Compliments of the house, sirs.

Mr. Gronomon said you two looked a little thirsty."

       "Great! "Said Isaac. Nothing like a cold fr osty mug of heavy dark beer to go with

my single malt. Helps wash away the taste."

       "What will you gentlemen have for lunch? "Quarried the waiter?

       Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair.

"Lets starts with pate de foie gras and cavia r and a basket of crackers to spread them on.

Triscuits, wheat thins, stuff like that. And some stuffed mushrooms and truffles on the
side. And a couple of triple thick chocolat e mocha latte to drink." He might be 50 now

but he could still pack it away. Nothing that a few good rounds of racquet ball and polo

wouldn't burn back off. Too bad Bruce wa  s all knocked up. Bruce had such a studly

body, rock0-hard abs and massive shoulders fr om working out and weight lifting, but he

was starting to get just a little pudgy since the accident. Isaac had seen him in the locker

room at the gym. Kid was pretty we        ll hung, too. Probably had chicks throwing

themselves at him all the time. He'd be    tter stay away from Isaac's daughter, Irene

Stevens, though! Kid was making a lot of        money with his software development

company, too, and Isaac wanted a piece of that. If he could buy his way in now, he might

be sitting really pretty in a few more years.

       "I'd like some artichoke hearts and pickled eggs, too" mused Bruce lucent.

       "And make sure there's plenty of whipped cream on my latte."

       "Yes Sir!" exclaimed the waiter. He hurried off to do their bidding in the kitchen.

       Bruce rubbed his rock-hard abs. I'm ge tting a little pudgy with all this inactivity

since the accident he mused. I'll have to really  work to get back in shape once I'm better.

A good thing that shrapnel just nicked my thigh rather than cutting a little higher or I

might be singing a little higher. Wouldn't want to? Disappoint the ladies.

       The sunlight was very warm on his       face and side from the window and he

wondered if he was going to start sweating. Fi re and ice he thought to himself. Too cold

air-conditioning and too hot sun. I'm being fro zen on one side and roasted on the other.

I'll be shivering and sweating at the same time.  Isaac will think I've got a fever. Fire and

ice, ice cream and jalapeno, ice water and  steam, cold and hot, freezing on one side and

roasting on the other. He fled uncomfortable, like he had the flu and had a fever.
       "It's kind of chilly in here " commiserated Isaac. "How come you look so hot?"

       "It's this sunlight, groaned Bruce, "I 'm boiling on one side and freezing on the

other."

       The waiter brought their appetizers and set them in front of them. "More beer," he

queried? "It's on the house."

       "Sure" quipped Bruce and Isaac together. The waiter refilled their mugs.

       "Hot enough for you?" he quipped?

       "Yes," shivered Bruce. I'm boiling on one side and freezing on the other."

       "Like Fire and ice."

       "Try the cold beer," offered the waiter. " That should help cool you down some."

       Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair.

"Here's to further success with your company,"  he enjoined. Bruce returned the toast and

they clanged their frosty mugs of dark beer together, than swilled large mouthfuls down."

       "Ahhh . . . ," declaimed Bruce, "That was good. Cold."

       They tucked into the appetizers. There was pate de foie gras and caviar and

stuffed mushrooms and truffles and artichoke  hearts and pickled eggs and crackers and

they washed it all down with cold frosty dark beer in foamy mugs and sipped their latte.

       "Aaaah . . . " exclaimed Bruce, "That wa s really good. How about some real food

now?"

       "Oh, yes, "agreed Isaac" some real food w ould really hit the spot now. Waiter, I'd

like a half pound of rare T-bone steak smothe red in mushrooms and onions and a baked

potato with cheese and sour cream and bacon  bits and steamed baby carrots and corn on

the cob."
       "Yes sir!" exclaimed the waiter. "And you Mr. Lucent?"

       "I'll have a roasted chicken stuffed with  truffle and cranberry dressing, a baked

potato with butter and sour cream, and a side of some baby back ribs."

       "Yes Sir!" he declaimed and hurried off to the kitchen.

       Bruce scratched at his neck brace. "Who was that babe I saw you with at the party

last week?" he simpered.

       Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair.

"That was my daughter, Irene Stevens. She came to the party with me."

       "Your daughter?" inquired Bruce? "Wow. She was really hot. I'd surely like to get

to know her better."

       "Well," countered Isaac, "That might be  arranged, as long as things go all right,

you understand."

       "Cool," quipped Bruce, who was feeling  hot on one side and cold on the other.

"Fire and ice." Bruce wanted to get out of  all these casts and things first, though. And to

get all his stitches out. Or maybe not. She mi ght feel more compassionate toward him if

she saw him this way first and that could l ead to more passionate fun later. What a hot

babe! He could hardly wait to see her with   her clothes off. They'd start slow, maybe a

game of strip poker or something classy lik  e that and then once they were ready they

could go right for the brass ring. His slacks tightened and he winced as one of his stitches

pulled out.

       Bruce rubbed his throbbing crotch where the cast rubbed and the stitch had pulled

out and his pants were too  tight now. "So, " he inquired? "What did you want to talk

about?"
       Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair.

"Well, " he countered. "You've been very successful with your software company and I'd

like to talk about that. I really admire a   successful man who makes a lot of money and

you're one. Especially as young as you are,   to be so successful and making so much

money, if you know what I mean. I admire that."

       "Yes, " agreed Bruce. "I am doing rather well and I enjoy making money. Not the

money so much as all the things it can buy. A ll the wonderful things I can do with it. I

own half of this town, Trotter's Corner, now  and someday I'd like to  own half of Atlanta

itself. First I'm going to name this to  wn, though. I'm going to name it Lucentville! Do

you hear that everyone? This town is now   Lucentville! And someday Atlanta will be

named Lucent City!"

       Everybody cheered and the waiter brought their food. "More Beer," he carried?

"It's on the house! ."

       "Sure!" they quipped and dug into their food.

       "Well," chewed Stevens around his steak and potatoes and onions and mushrooms

and corn on the cob, "I'd like to invest in your company. I'd like to give you a lot of

money so that I can have a part of your company and I'll introduce you to Irene, too."

Bruce scratched at his neck brace. "Well," he gobbled past his roast chicken and ribs,

                      "That sounds quite decent of you.   I think I'd like that. And I'm

                      especially looking forward to getting to know Irene Stevens better,

                      if you know what I mean." Wow,  was she hot! Fire and ice! They

                      devoured their food   and drank more toasts from tall, foamy,

                      mugs of ice cold beer. "To Lucentville!"
       "To Lucent Software Development Corp.!"

       "To Irene Stevens!"

       "To Life!"

       "Fire and ice!"

       At last they finished their meals. Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then

brushed backs his close trimmed hair. "How about some desert?" inquired Isaac.

       Bruce rubbed his throbbing crotch where  the cast rubbed against it and his stitch

had pulled out and his pants were swollen with lust. "Dessert would be great!" declaimed

Bruce. "I'm famished! ."

       Fire and ice.
                                         

       Margaret and Irene sat in silence for    thirty-two minutes, each gathering their

thoughts together, each afraid to say the first word, knowing that the first word could lead

anywhere, including the truth.

       Irene signaled for a latte with one hand and fingered her long blonde hair with the

other twisting it again and again until it spiraled  like a golden staircase leading to the top

of her head. When the pain started, she wept, expostulating "I don't know what I'll do

without Henry. He was the center of the world."

       "Even the center of the world has to die  sometime." Margaret sat sideways in her

chair, her breasts a pair of protruding Alps.
       "He didn't seem like the kind of man w  ho died," Irene said. "Sometimes, when

were in bed, making love, at the very edge  of the surf where the waves washed over us

again and again, I looked at hi s face and saw something there that not even all the forces

of erosion could ever wash away. He was a determined man, and in his position he had to

be: and I knew that, too, looking  up at him wanting only for him to be there forever. He

was old, you know: he was around in the seve    nties and everything. But there was an

agelessness to him, a beautiful eternal foreverness that shone from him like the light from

a lighthouse, or like the sunlight from the s un. He made me feel like a child again, and I

wanted to stay in bed with him, feeling  him warm my world, cooled by the waves that

washed over us, until the stars went out. That   what I expected anyway. That's what he

promised. And now he's dead. His heart's stopped."

       Margaret's eyes darted toward Irene in expressive regard. "Yes."

       "What am I supposed to do without him?"

       The unanswerable stolidity of the question echoed in the space between them, and

there was nothing Margaret could say that c ould make the other woman feel any better.

As a nurse who had been taking care of peopl e about to die and who had died for longer

than most people could guess, she had spoken  to her share of people mourning the death

of their loved ones. She had earned a nationw ide reputation for her bedside management,

as she always knew what to say to make peopl e take the deaths of those they cared for

most for just another part of life that need ed to be endured and which would be one day

feel better. Doctors always asked Margaret  to help when their patients died. But some

deaths were not like other deaths, some deaths were too much to be borne.
       Some deaths hit those who were left     behind like a bomb exploding in their

houses, leaving just rubble behind. Margar    et did not know what to say to this

spectacularly beautiful woman before her, to  make her feel better that the man she loved

more than she loved life itself had been so cruelly taken from her.

       A tear formed at the corner of her own  eye (the left) as she shook her head and

said, "I don't know. Sometimes we lose the whole reason we're alive. Sometimes we have

to go out somehow and find a new reason. A   reason not dictated by law or morality or

even sense. Some new person to love. Some new way to live. Some new purpose to make

the night seems warmer. I think Henry was probably the kind of man who knew that if he

ever died in a horrible car accident, leav ing you behind, that you would find the courage

to stand up and move on and climb out of  this place where you are. He would not want

you to be here, now. Or ever. He would wa nt you at the beach where you were at your

best, in the waves, in bed."

       "Maybe." Irene swigged her steaming latte in one scalding gulp. "And maybe --"

       "Maybe what?"

       "I remember one night, the best night for us. He took me to Rome where we stood

in the light of the Eiffel Tower and watched the people go by. There was one couple there

who reminded us of us. There was another  man Henries age and another woman my age

and they were laughing together, just   laughing, hard you know the way people laugh

when they really feel the joy of life,  the two of them, laughing! Laughing! Laughing, til

the tears came down the sides of their faces  in great cascades, and I was a little worried

that they would not be able to breathe but   Henry said, look at them, Irene, just look at

them, look at her and look at him, look at  them, the very themes of them, you know it's
not a she and a him but a them, two of them  together, in one unit, laughing and laughing

here in the city of brotherly love, their laughs echoing and echoing and echoing up and

up and up drowning out the traffic and the conve rsations of other tourists and the singing

of the Christmas cajoler and even the mo   tor noises, filling the world, it was a lot of

laughing, and me remember Harry squeezing my hand's til the bones hurt and saying, you

know, I laughed like that once, many years ago, when I was a boy, and I don't even

remember the joke anymore but I always wa nted to laugh that way again and sometimes

when I take a good look at you I think I have  a chance. And I never thought of it again

but he also said that night, you know, honey, I' m much older than you and that means I'll

be dead before you, and it will be worth dying ev en in a terrible car wreck if that means

that between now and the moment of that car wreck we laugh at least once as hard as that

couple walking by just now, though they were  long past us by the time he got around to

saying that. He said make me laugh like th   at again Irene. And I said surely, but you

know, there was always the older-man, younge r-woman thing and as much as I thought

of him as some kind of God me never once got around to making him laughs." Twisting

her hair into a braid using the same finger  she had been using before she said, "And now

I will have to live my entire life, however l ong that turns out to be, knowing that I never

gave him what he wanted. I made him come but never made him guffaw."

       The sun broke through the clouds then   its brilliant golden disk burning a hole

through the great puffs of water vapor to   send a shaft of golden light zigzagging down

through the layers of atmosphere and warm the earth in a way that no sunlight since the

beginning of time had ever warmed the earth  before. Somewhere a child was being born.

Somewhere a dog was barking. Life was going on but in this one moment at this
particular place in time and space.  The two  beautiful women, one twisting her hair into

knots, the other sittings sideways, were not part  of it. They were here only for each other

and for the memory of a great man who had walked the earth like a rock in the sand. Life

is like that sometimes, thought Margaret help lessly. Sometimes is just an interruption in

the day and not a part of it. The trick is knowing when it's day and when it's night and the

lightness or darkness has nothing to do with   telling the difference between them. The

death of a man like Henry Archer was definitely night even if it took place at noon. It was

like an eclipse of the world. There must ha   ve been people even in distant primitive

villages who had felt the moment he breathed his last. They must have looked up at the

night sky or even the day sky and said, what was that, meaning him.

       Irene lit a cigarette and blew out a huge  cloud of smoke. "What am I going to do

without him?" she wailed. "What?"

       Margaret had no answer except for the ones she had already given.
                                        

       Richard studied the menu like a shark sa voring a school of school of fish while

the waiter impatiently tapped his fountain pen against his pad. Across the table, he felt

Callie's eyes upon him, waiting for him to make up his minds. Yet his mind wasn't on

lunch, but upon Callie; he could sense her own im patience with him, as if she was trying

to decide whether she wanted to be dining with him at all, or whether she would be just

as happy to be eating by herself.

       "I'll take the filet mignons," he said. "Rare, please, and with the garlic mashed

potatoes. And to start  hmm, perhaps th  e New England clams chowder." He briefly

consulted the wine list. "And perhaps a bottle of Riesling, please. 1999 vintage."
       "Very good, sir." The young waiter, whose name tag said his name was Frederick,

and who sported a pencil-thin mustache, studiously jotted it all down, then turned to

Callie. "And for you, madam? May I recommend the calamari soufflé  it's in a season."

       "Yes, I think so," she said stiffly. A  nd a chef's salad to start. But hold the

dressing, please."

       "As you wish, madam." Frederik clicked  his pen, then moved off into the hustle

and bustle of the restaurant. Le Bonhomie was busy today, busier than usual; Richard ate

here often, usually with other Peachtree Street brokers who he was trying to get info from

about deals they were making. It was one of the best, most fashionable bistros in Atlanta,

which is why he liked it so much. The serv ice was superb, and the food was pretty good,

too.

       "And so," Richard said, as he unfolded  his napkin and laid it daintily across his

lap, "how are you getting along, now that Henry is gone?"

       Callie reached into her handbag, pulled    out a compact. "As well as could be

expected, I suppose," she said, opening it to st udy her reflection in its mirror. "Oh, I miss

him so much, but " She sniffed, then closed it and tucked it back in her bag. "Well, life

must go on, you know. Life must go on."

       "Yes, it does." She wore a black silk dress to day, low-cut, better to expose the

generous mounds of her bosom. Callie was  a fine-looking woman, Richard had to admit,

and the dress left little to his teeming imagination; her nipples, like the silver dollars he

used to collect when he was a kid, pressed against the fabric, arousing him. "Yes it does

indeed. Life must go on."
       Callie observed his interest. She pouted,  looking like the Mona Lisa having a bad

day. "Is there a reason why you asked me to co me here, Richard?" Then she lowered her

voice to a husky contralto. "Or should I call you Dick?"

       He caught her meaning, found his livid f ace turning red. "No," he said. "Richard

would be just fine, Callie. I was just admiring your dress. From China, isn't it?"

       "Yes," she said. "From Hong-Kong. Henry took me there many years ago, for one

of his boring business trips. I loved the shops . I thin k I must have spent hours in them,

bung things you can't buy here in America. And he was very generous, too. I think I must

have maxed out an American Express Plati  num Card just on clothes and jewelry. Oh,

what a trip that was!"

       "I can imagine," Richard said. He wondere d if the police would be interested in

her purchases when she was abroad. He ha d little doubt that many of them had not been

declared with U.S. Customs. But a woman like her wouldn't have, have had much trouble

dealing with lowly Customs inspectors, now  would she? She would have just smiled her

and winked and perhaps slipped a hundred-dollar bill across the counter, ands a horny

young Customs inspector would have let the rich dame pass. Happens all the time. "And

it fits you well, too," he added.

       She glowered at him from across the tabl e. "You're not here to ask me about my

wardrobe," Callie said. "What do you really have on you're mind? Really?"

       "Oh, you know." Richard Isaacs crossed his legs casually, like a king sitting upon

his throne and examining a peasant who had come to him in supplication.

       "Don't quote "Alice in Wonderland" to me ," she quietly seethed. "You're up to

something, and I want to know what it is!"
       Oh, she was a tempestuous little wench, wasn 't she? Henry Archer didn't deserve

her  hadn't deserved, he reminded hims      elf. 20 years younger than he was, and

manipulative as Hell's own vixen, but she' d known how to spend his money, didn't she?

But now Henry was gone, an ans. she had been  left with his considerable fortune, along

with his company, and Richard was interest ed in both. The company and the widow who

controlled it that is.

       "I'm wondering what you intend to do with   Richard's company," he said, as the

waiter returned with the first  part of their meal. "Do you intend to keep it, or is it your

intent to sell?"

       She waited while the waiter, Frederic, placed her salad in front of her, then saved

a generous portion of black pepper and Parmesan cheese on top of it. She glared at the

plate. "There's anchovy on this," she huffe d. "I cannot abide by anchovies. Remove it at

once, please, and bring me another."

       "Oui, madam. Anything to please.       " The waiter looked annoyed, but he

disappeared with the plate, and came back   a second later with a fresh salad, without

anchovies. Satisfied, she speared a crouton with her silver fork and shoved it into her

mouth. The waiter smirked with disdain, then  carefully placed a bowl of New England

Clam Chowder in front of Richard. It was hot  and fragrant, just the way he liked it; he

smiled and nodded. "Bon appetite," Frederick said, then he moved away to attend to his

other customers.

       "I haven't decided about the company  yet," Callie drawled, chewing thoughtfully

upon her food. "I suppose I could sell it, but . . . " She hesitated, daubing at the corners of
her eyes with her napkin. "Oh, what would Henry say, if I sold the company he struggled

so long and hard to build."

       "I imagine he would want you to do what  was best for you." Once again, Richard

found himself examining her cleavage. So soft,  so firm; like Florida cantaloupes, ripe for

the picking. Although she was young enough to       be his own child, he found himself

wondering what it might be like to have her   in bed, to run his hands through her silky

black tresses, to knead and stroke and cajole her breasts into submission, to slip his hands

between her thighs and explore the damp, wa rm secrets within. Henry Archer must have

done this, time and time again, when they we re married, and Henry had been only a few

years younger. And now . . .

        No! He couldn't! Once more, Richar d found himself becoming aroused, and he

fought to keep his mind on the immediate probl em at hand. "You could do this," he said,

idly stirring the bowl of chowder, "but the company stock, put on the open market now,

could fetch quite a high price. Perhaps even  ten times as much as its presently worth on

the New York exchange. You could be very rich."

       "I'm already rich," Callie said, but there wa s a flash of avarice in her dark eyes as

they rose to meet his. "Ten times as much, you say? Surely you jest!"

       "I'm not joking. Have you seen today's    "The Wall Street Journal?" The story

about Henry's car crash has sent the pr  ices through the ceiling. The NASDAQ itself is

running wild. It's the talk of the town!" Rich ard stared back at her. "The time to sell is

now, Callie, and I'd only too pleased to help. If only you'd let me."

       Her breasts heaved against the taught fabric of her black dress, and again his eyes

fell to them. Yes, she would be grateful. And once she'd properly expressed her gratitude,
perhaps his friends in the police department w ould be grateful to him. Henry's tragic car

accident had been too convenient, too swift.  Callie Archer had more secrets than what

she had hidden beneath her Victoria's Secret li ngerie. And all he needed to do was to get

at them, and he would be . . .

       A dark shadow falls across the table,  and a new voice interrupted them. "Pardon

me," it said, "but is this seat taken?"

       Richard jerked his head up, peered at   the uninvited intruder. Bruce Lucent, the

software developer. Young, handsome, well- known around Atlanta for the software he'd

developed. What was he doing hear?

       "I couldn't help but overhear," Bruce said,  as if in answer to the unasked query.

"Callie, I'm so sorry to hear about Henry's death. He meant so much to the rest of us."

       "I didn't know you knew him well." Richar d couldn't help but notice how Callie's

eyes roved over him. Bruce was younger even       than Callie, yet even despite the auto

accident he'd suffered his body was lean and   trim, with a youthful verve that Richard

could barely remember. "Please, have a seat. We just ordered."

       "Why, thank you. I think I will." Bruce move  d to the empty chair at the table,

then snapped his fingers for the waiter. "Garcon! A menu, please."

       "Oui. At once, m'sieur!" And as the waiter hurried away to fetch a board for the

unexpected interloper, Richard realized that the plot had thickened, indeed.
                                        

       Penelope Urbain let out the clutch as she sped around the curve. She felt a thrill

 partly from the roaring engine, from the   speed of the car (she was moving fast, too

fast, on a suburban street, and she liked the speed too much). Partly, no, mostly  mostly

it was the thrill of anticipation. She was going to meet Bruce Lucent, and she was eager

to see him.

       She could not have said why she wanted him so badly, but she did. Wanted to see

him! That was all it was, she was curious,   maybe more than curious. Eager, but  not

too eager.

       There. That was his home. That was where she meant to be.

       She hit the brakes hard, skidded to a stop in front of his home.

       He was in the doorway, waiting for her.
       Penny, he said. Ive been waiting for you.

       There was a hint of suggestion in his smile, something that whispered to her

dreams.

       She embraced him, whispering his name. Bruce, she whispered, and felt a chill

at the turgid warmth of his body.

       He kissed her, so lightly. He wanted her,  she could feel it in his lips. She wanted

him, too, but not so easily  not here, not  now. (She thrilled at that thought. Here! Now!

 No!) Dinner, she said. Where will we go?

       Ive got reservations for us at Le Moulin de la Gallette, Bruce said.

       Penelope Urbain knew the place  it was French, continental, lit by candles,

elegant and intimate; shed gone there once,  alone, and eaten Saucisses de Francfort by a

window in the back that looked over the moonlit garden . . .

       Thatd be nice, she said. I like the way you think, Bruce Lucent.

       Bruce took a remote control from his pocke t, pointed it at the garage. An engine

roared to life as the door began to shudder   open; in a moment a car emerged, its doors

opening gently as a suggestion.

       Its ready when we are, said Bruce.     He smiled. Im always ready. If you

are . . . He was already in, on the drivers side; no one had to ask Penelope twice.

                                          # # #

       There are moments when life, like a bad movie, gives us theme music. The good

stuff is quiet  maybe Rachmaninoff, played softly in the background; Bach or

Beethoven  in the classy films, its one of those, or maybe Mozart. Bruce Lucents life

wasnt like that. More like, oh, more like Popcorn  the electronic pop version, quick,
zippy, headed straight toward a climax. In the end, well, its a little flat  too much air,

too little substance; it just aint Beethove n, you know what I mean? But its something,

and we cant all be Beethoven, there isnt talent enough in all the world for that.

       Penelope nestled into the crook of Bruces arm. It didnt matter to her that the

music was Popcorn; for her it was Wagner and Valkyries, all the way.

       I love your lustrous hair, he whispe   red. I love red hair, real red, its so

beautiful.

       Only her hairdresser knew for sure, and   itd been years since hed confided in

Penelope. She didnt know what color shed     have without him, and shuddered at the

thought.

       Youre a sweet man, she said. I love your passion.

       Bruce grinned. You make me rapturously happy, he said.

       Penelope Urbain felt a chill that thrilled her. Me too, she said. He raised an

eyebrow. I mean, you make me feel  so happy, too.  Rapturously happy. Yeah, thats

the word for it  rapturous.

       She could feel his firm studly body under her left hand.

       He was smiling at her. He looked hungry.

       I was in an auto accident, once, he said. The doctors told me Id never walk

again. But they were wrong.

       She smiled, nestling into the crook of his ar m. Of course they were, she said.

How did you recover?

       I lived my dream, he said. And didnt let their nay-saying dissuade me.
       She pressed her voluptuous body against him. He was pulling into the restaurant's

garage, turning, downshifting, jamming the brak e  they were there, parked. The valet

came to her door, helped her from her seat.  Bruce gave the man his keys and a twenty;

the man smiled knowingly.

       Bruce took her arm and led her to the door , where they waited a long moment for

the maitre d'.

       "You're in software?" she said.

       Bruce smiled. "I'm a software develope  r," he said. "Well-to-do  about 20. I

have a studly body, don't you think?"

       She looked him up and down. It was indeed the finest body that money could buy.

       She smiled. "If I tell you you have a   sexy body," she said, "would you hold it

against me?"

       He put an arm around her, pulled her close. "You know I would," he said.

       She purred. "I like that," she said. "I like Atlanta. It's such a cosmopolitan city."

       Bruce whispered in her ear. "It is."

       "Atlanta is a great place for an enthusias tic would-be novelist to write about. The

Atlanta Journal-Constitution is a first-rate paper,  and CNN is headquartered right here in

Atlanta!"

       "Oh, Penelope!"

       "Oh Brad!"

       "I'm Bruce. My name is Bruce, beautiful."

       "O Bruce!"
       Dinner was amazing  Brad or Bruce or   whatever the studmuffin's name was

ordered the eponymous specialty of the house, les moulins de las gallettes, they call it the

food that sings, and it sang for them before it was prepared. They drank before dinner 

Bruce ordered, quietly speaking to the waite  r. "Deux ouragans, si vous plait. Double

fort."

       With dinner there was a magnum of champagne, and after dinner there was coffee

and brandy. Penelope felt her head swim as sh e rested it into the crook of Bruce's arm 

it was an amazing meal, an experience she w  ould always treasure. She wanted him so

bad, and there, in the quiet that was the ca ndle-lit restaurant, he touched her. She didn't

resist. He wanted her, and she wanted him, too.
                                        

       The elegant Polo Club walls were adorned with a great plentitude of exquisite

paintings, depicting a tremendous multitude     of beautiful scenes, with still lives of

flowers, horses, sailing boats, and landscapes.   They are from all sorts of great painters

and they had one every few feet.  Their frames are gold gilt and filled with curlicues and

fancy carving.  The floors were polished white    marble, with veins of luminous color

running through them, and you can see your count enance in them because they polished

every morning.  A commodious, confident cloak room was standing discretely behind the

double door, for coats, but was empty on this lovely, gorgeous, beautiful morning.  There

was an elegant, gracious, wide stairway to the second floor that had gilt on the black iron

railing.  It was orthogonal and it curved around  it.  The carpet was bright, vivid, glorious

red.  The French windows in the vestibule were open to the patio, and the sound of tennis
games came in, and the scintillating, witty, spar kling chatter from the black wrought iron

tables and chairs with all their twisting tw ining cingulated vines in their arms and legs

there, where lunch was being served and the  smell of the food came in, too.  There was a

guest book on a table in the center of the ve  stibule, open to hold the disguised names.

There was a flower pot of Wedgewood china,  blue and white, sat behind it, filled with a

colorful, fragment, teeming profusion a nd arrangement of sweet-scented, multicolored

flowers.  Their vivid color contrasted w  ith the stark, plain, severe starkness of the

unadorned walls.

       The Atlanta Polo Club was an old and resp ected and very venereal institution.  It

had been founded more than two centuries ago and was members from all the most

respectable, notable and antique families in   the area.  When Sherman came marching

through Georgia they had saved a few things  from the old Polo Club, and the noble and

distinguishable members were very proud of  their traction.  They gads been very poor

after the war, but no presumptuous, odious, vi  al carpetbagger or scallywags had been

permitted too scornfully, contemptuously darken the doors of the Polo Club.  They had

carefully rebuilt it of dark oak paneling a  nd the lead-framed windows that were there

now.  They had spared no expense.  They had played polo whit cavalry horse brought

carefully back from the war, by young, ha      ndsome, honorable Calvary officers of

immemorial memory from the war.  They        were very very proud of their disgusted

memory and extended ancestry.  They had an  tique cavalry swords crossed over every

marble fireplace.  Many people tried to join it and couldn't.  It was very exclusive.  Some

of the aged members don't want anyone at all fr om the north to join, but there were other

members who were retrogressive and onward- thinking and they managed to ease folks
about those members, as long they stood       docility and listed resentfully when the

members talked prolixly about the novel war.  Some of their new members were very

good polo players and they had industriously managed too won many difficult games.

       Irene Stevens starts to pertly walk in to the Polo Club.  She had long blonde hair

and a voluptuous body.  She was about 20.  She was dressing in an expensive designer

cerulean gown and not a bit of jewelry; her   beauty needed no jewelry.  She tried and

signed the guest book.

       She had come there from her hotel, where she had checked out that morning.  She

had driven here down the tortuous roads by all the Civil War monuments and past the

pastures where they get the polo horses.  They were all thoroughbreds and very beautiful.

There had been flowers all along the way:  roses and tulips and asters and crocuses and

lilies and magnolias.  She had managed to park  her vehicle in the newest parking lot but

she had been compiled to park it where the fe rocious sunlight would infernally heat it up

while she was leisurely enjoining the Polo  Club.  The soaring oak trees and maple trees

had gloomily, dismally shaded the parking lot.

       Elegantly, She walked up the stairs.  the gown swished mysteriously about her

legs.  The sparkling mirror in the stairway considerately let her prudentially endeavor to

carefully check her hair and jewelry.  The artificial, incandescent light did not become

her.  It unflatteringly made her verdant dress and gold necklace look ghastly unbecoming.

But nothing could, in its worst efforts, ma  de her look less than marvelously stunning,

could really detract from her gorgeous beauty and loveliness and she hurriedly took arctic

comfort and consolation in that.
       She urgently meandered down the marmor  eal hallway to the opulent, exotic,

expansive bar.  It was very, very crowde  d and odorously noisy.  All the men instantly

stopped and ardently looked at her.  She w earisomely sighs.  She was getting very tired

of the way all the men instantly stopped a nd ardently looked at her voluptuous body and

long blonde hair and her vermilion dress      and her gold watch with the diamonds.

Especially when they were such tiresome stuffy old business men and none of them could

adequately, competently, sufficiently play tennis let alone anything more private.  And all

the women cattily looked at her with sniffy e xpressions, when they were foolish wearing

too much makeup and revolting, unsightly jewelry.  She can be already heard the snide

gossip began too perambulated its gossipy       peregrinations about the ostentatiously

crowded bar.

       Swiftly, she sveltely walks up to the   bar and smoothly orders a Bloody Mary.

The bartender sagaciously nods.  He competently  takes a crystal glass.  He swiftly gets

the  cold ice and put it in the empty glass.    Consequently, he gets the imported, foreign

vodka and put it in the glass with the red, opaque tomato juice.  He sticks a fair wedge of

easy lemon on the edge of it and promptly gives her it.

       She comfortably sat back in her opulent, luxurious chair and leisurely sighed.

       This was the right thing, after a long, w earisome, odious burdens and troubles of

an appalling day like that.

       She toyed with her pearls.

       The comfortable chair was brown leather and very nice.  She liked it.

       And she was here in the bar.

       Alone.
       It was nice.

       No one would talk here.  She carefully    tried and soothed out the skirt of her

sallow dress.

       She fortuitously remembered Henry Archer.

       She managed too shivered in memory.   No wonder no one was looking attentive

anymore, next to him.

       She  sips her martini.

       That was when Steven Suffern saw her.

       Steven was a well-built and well-hung young ma sseuse at the Polo Club.  He has

an eye for the ladies, but bats for both teams.

       His eyes narrowed when he saw her.

       Irene Stevens.

       Hear.

       Alone.

       There was no one around.

       No one would come to the Polo Club   on such a dreary, wet day, especially so

entirely early in the morning.

       Thunder cracked thunderously overhead.  There was a loud, voluminous

drumming and thumping of precipitous and abundant rain.

       He walked toward her.  Slowly.  Took each  step in leisure.  Contemplating Irena

with gimlet eyes.  Taking in that voraci  ous figure and the elonga ted blond hair.  The

carroty dress.  The ruby band.  He wanted  to linger, to savor the moment, to pounce at

once.
       She leisurely drank from her gin and tonic again.

       "Irena," he pontificates.  "You are the   daughter of Isaac Stevens. I will reveal

your dark secret to your father unless you allow me to have my way with you."

       "No," exclaimed she, horror stuck.

       "Yes," grated he, harshly.

       "You will not!" expostulated she.

       "I will reveal your dark secret!" exclaimed he.

       "I will not allow you to have you way with me!" she avowed.

       "You will!" he averted.

       "No, you won't reveal my dark secret," th reatened she, numbly.  "My father will

never believe you."

       "I will, and he will," exerted her.

       "You won't and he won't," claimed he.

       "I will, and he will," remonstrated he.

       "You won't," explained she, in an explanatory tone of voice.  "My father will be

very, very, very furious with you.  He will certainly blame you."

       "I will and he won't," demonstrated he, contemptuously.

       "You won't and he will," proclaimed her, definitely.

       "I will and he won't," declared he, defiantly.

       "You won't," denounced her, angrily.  "I already told him last Tuesday."

       It was as if a copious galleon of wintry water had been surreptitiously poured over

his hansom head.  He sat stonily and goggled  explicitly and gaped impassively as if he

were a fish precipitously extracted from   its appropriately aqueous environment.  He
boisterously, wordlessly, softly sputtered like a boiling tea kettle.  He stolidly sat like an

ancient, moss-overgrown statue from the ra diantly fragrant gardens that the noble city

was plenteously, bountifully endowed with.

       She contentiously got up and stylishly walked away, her amethystine dress

swirling about her ankles, fondly rememberi ng his exquisite, superb physique and form

of his well-proportionate, muscled body.  She dazedly walked down the polished wood of

the stairway and out of the Polo Club and  up the hill and under the oaks and over to her

vehicle.
                                        

       The nightclub was the Blue Velvet. It was noisy and hot and Callie was thinking

how the sweat made her look hot. The heat of  the Atlanta last night made it even hotter

inside. Bruce didn't like the Blue Velvet because it was full of old people who thought it

was still a cool place only it wasn't any more. He did think Callie looked hot.

       "Hey, do you want to dance?" he said.

       "Sure."
       Bruce wasn't hot and thought if he tired  Callie out he might get a better deal on

the merging companies. Callie thinks Bru  ce is studly looking, and she liked to dance

anyway, so she said yes.

       They danced for a long time. Until she says she was tired and could they sit down

at a table.

       Now she felt really tired but was sure the sweat made her look really hot to Bruce.

She smoothed her glossy black tresses.

       "You didn't put any drugs in this dri  nk, did you?" she said. She thought Bruce

might try to take advantage of her to get a better deal on the merger.

       "Speaking of the merger," Bruce asked, "what did you want to do about that?" He

has to shout over the noise of the band.  The band was a retro 80's punk rock band. They

were a local group and looked like high school  boys. Callie thought one of them looked

pretty hunky, but not as hunky as Bruce.

       "I think it's a good idea." She whispered, "what couples a million?"

       Bruce decided he should think about it and said, "I'm going to have to think about

it."

       "Did you want more?"

       "Well, sure, of course I want more. Why would I want less?" He really thought he

could get a lot more. He wasn't thinking just about that one kind of merger, either.

       "It's pretty warm in here, maybe late r we could go somewhere quieter and talk

about the details."

       "Like what kind of details?"

       "Like who will run the merged company for one thing."
       "I sort of thought I would and you'd be my second in command."

       "I think we'll have to talk about that. But I think we should dance some more right

now."

       They danced for a long time.

       While they were dancing Bruce asked Callie about her husband.

       "Did you wear him out dancing like this?"

       "You mean like dance so much until he had a heart attack or something?"

       "Yeah."

       "No."

       Bruce laughed. "I almost died once."

       "I heard about that. I did a lot of res earch on you before I agreed our companies

should merge."

       "It was a car crash."

       "You seem pretty well recovered."

       "I have some pretty nasty scars though. I was 16 and I run the car into a pole."

       "I'll have to see them sometime."

       "Maybe later, if we go somewhere quieter to talk about the merger."

       She spills her drink all over him. "Oh, I'm so sorry! I guess we'll have to go now."

       "No, it's ok.  I can dry it off  with these napkins." He wiped at his shirt. He was

starting to get hot and it kind of made he feels cooler in a way. Besides he wasn't ready to

talk about details of the merger yet. He wanted to make sure Callie was more tireder first.

"See that all dry?" he said. "By the way, I th ink it's pretty cool what your company does.

Transatlantic shipping is pretty interesting."
       "Yes it will be good to be merged with  your software company. I know you make

a lot of money with your Internet multi-le vel-marketing software. With the money you

make from all those people sending you money  and from my shipping, we'll be able to

take trips all over the world all the time." Besides, she thought he was pretty studly and if

it didn't work out after a while they could un merge their companies too.

       "You're older than a lot of the women I talk to," he said, and he meant it.

       "My husband said the opposite thing when he was alive. He said I was younger

than the people his age. But I learned a   lot from him about running business. Nobody

thought I could run it after he died, but I s  howed them." Bruce thinks she has a pretty

good body for someone her age. She was probabl y the same age as his mother only his

mother wasn't very good looking like Callie  . She had a voluptuous body even if she

wasn't twice as old as I.

       "Well it's getting late isn't it? Do you th ink we should stop dancing now and talk

about business?" She really wanted to get the big deal finished t onight and not have to

involve all the lawyers.

       "I don't know." Bruce wasn't sure if  she was tired enough. Since she was older,

she was probably wiser. Even though he wa       s well-to-do himself from his software

company, she was twice his age and had proba bly learned a lot more about business than

he did so he has to be careful of any tr icks she might pull. "Are you pretty tired? We

could go back to my place."

       "It's pretty hot in here." She said.

       "Then let's have another drink. Since you spilled that one before you didn't get to

finish it."
       "Okay but just one more."

       "Could we get another drink?" Bruce asked  the bartender. She was pretty hot too

and more Bruce's type since she was younger. Bruce liked her red hair. Callie's hair was

black which was okay with Bruce but he      liked red better. The bartender was maybe

exactly 22. He knew she had to be more than   21 to serve. He thought he should order

more drinks just to have her come over to where they were sitting at the bar.

       "Here you are."

       "Thanks."

       "You're welcome."

       "Thanks," Callie said too.

       "And you're welcome too."

Bruce liked the way the bartender said "you're welcome." But

he was here with Callie and thought he shoul  d pay attention to her instead. They were

here to talk about the merger was another reason.

       "We could merge our offices together too."

       "That might be nice."

       Callie didn't like her office all that we   ll. It was on the top floor of the

NationsBank building in downtown. That's being the tallest building in Atlanta. The view

was good but she didn't like how long it took to ge t up in the elevator every time. "I don't

really like my office," she said.

       "Well then we can all use my office." Hi s office was back in California and had a

lot of plants in it. Bruce thought it was cool   that they hired someone to come in with a

tank of water to water the plants since they  were real and not fake. It didn't look out over
the city or anything but he didn't know what kind of view Callie's office had anyway so it

didn't matter.

       "When we go to your place to talk about the merger, you can show me your scars.

I bet you have impressive scars."

       "From the car crash. Yes, they are impre ssive." He sipped his beer. "I could show

you here but I'd have to take off my shirt  and I think they don't allow that here." He

smiled.

       Callie smiled too. She wanted to make      sure she didn't get too drunk so she

finished this one which was a scotch and  ordered a beer. You don't get as drunk from a

beer. She held her drinks pretty good anyway  because she learned to drink scotches from

her husband who had been a heavy drinker. It  was too.  Bad Bruce was playing hard to

get about the merger. He was wondering if sh e had enough to drink yet so he could get a

good deal. She was thinking they were having   one of those awkward silent times in a

conversation and she should say something.

       "If we did merge what will that do to the depreciation do you think?"

       Bruce didn't know anything about depreciation and was now getting worried.

"You're not thinking of backing out being you?"

       "No, I don't think so."

       "The depreciation thing is worrying you I think."

       "It's always a worry, isn't it?"

       "Well it's different on shipping than on software I'm pretty sure."

       "We'll make a lot of money if we merge though. We both know that."
       Bruce stretched. She thought she could s ee the outline of his scars under his tight

black shirt that was the same color as her   hair. He was afraid he might be getting tired

and it was probably time to move things al ong. Merging their companies was going to be

a good idea no matter what the objections and he   told her, "I think merging will be a

good idea no matter what, don't you?" He was a  little worried about driving because he'd

had his car crash at night like this and it was when he was maybe a little drunk so he was

hoping he could drive okay.

       They would really make a lot of money if they merged. He had done a lot of

mergers and this was going good. His accountant would be really happy with this merger.

       "Do you want to have another glass      of wine or do you think we should go

somewhere quieter? I can hardly hear you in here."

       She could hardly hear him either.

       So they went back to his place and hammered out the details of the merger and

signed the papers. "Then that's it.  We're all merged!"

       She toasted him with the champagne glasses.

       That wasn't all that got merged that night.

       They had wild sex.
                                        

       Bruce Lucent limped out onto the patio in  the hot light of the late afternoon sun,

carrying a tray where a mound of freshly chopped up hamburger gleamed red and wet

like a pile of bloody spaghetti, and put the   tray down on the gleaming glass patio table

with its matching set of six wrought-up iron ch airs, where Penelope Urbain sat with her

long legs as graceful as the fronds of a   willow tree crossed in a provocative pose that

made him think about last night and the passion theyd shared hour after hour till the

turgid light of dawn folded down over Atla nta like the petals of a bloody rose and they

were both too exhausted to move another mu scle. Maybe, hed thought as they sank into

sleep like two swimmers whod just won a  race across the English Channel, just maybe

things were going to work out after all. Maybe  they could get it together at last. Seeing
her now, as beautiful and fresh as a s unny morning in May, even though it was August,

his heart skipped a bat.

       Hey, babe, Bruce offered. Wanna grill some  hamburgers?

       The happy expression fell off of Penelope   Urbains finely featured visage. She

pressed her slender hand to her moist red lip s and shook her lustrous red hair back over

her shoulders, bouncing like the vibrant mane of a thoroughbred horse.

       Is that . . . meat? she gasped, her eyes, the color of a warm blue sky in

springtime, falling onto the tray. Red . . . meat?

       Yeah, babes, Bruce affirmed proudly. Bona fide 100% sirloin.

       Penelope fluttered, her corn flower blue eyes still stuck to the tray. Its really

grizzly.

       Honey, dont you like hamburgers? Bruce  wanted to know, crestfallen. That

beef is chalked full of protein! Bruce gr  inned contagiously. And we could both use

some protein, after last night! If you know what I mean!

       But . . . dont you remember, Bruce? Pe  nelope reproached, her sapphire orbs

now grasping his. Im a vegetarian!

       Bruces lungs ricocheted with shock, cau sing him to let out a gasp, and remorse

swept over him in a stunning tide.   Darn, he exclaimed to himself.  How could I forget

that?

       Wow, babe, Bruce stumbled, Im . . . Im really sorry. I...I guesses should have

picked up a carrot or something while I was at the store.

       Its . . . its OK, honey, Penelope tried to smile forgivingly, but he could see the

betrayal in her limpid azure eyes exactly like shed said it out loud. Im . . . Im not
really all that hungry. Ill just watch while you and Isadore eat. He . . . he is coming, isnt

he?

       Hes Enright right now.

       Good. I...I was hoping he would, she commented softly.

       Bruce Lucent put the tray down on the tabl  e. He began to shape the hamburger

patties, shaping the meat into round, circular shapes with his strong hands. Usually he

caressed the hamburger like a lover, loving the  way the soft red meat squished yieldingly

between his hands and the sensuous sucki ng sounds it made when he pulled his hands

away once he got the round shapes just the way he wanted them, not too thick and not too

thin, not too wide and not too small, but ju  st right, like the Three Bears, except it was

hamburger and not porridge. He was an artist with hamburger, everyone said so.

       But today it wasnt good like usual. The way Penelopes exquisite features had

fallen when her eyes swooped down onto the meat had taken roots inside his brain like

the tentacles of a poisonous black spider.

       I let her down again, he berated himself savagely. I betrayed her. Again.

       Why didnt I remember that shes a vegetarian?       he ruminated to himself

worriedly.  This must be the fourth time Ive forgotten. Or is it the fifth? But Im

forgetting a lot of things,  his thoughts veered off on a tangent.   So many things I cant

remember since my accident. Like . . . like making hamburgers with my mother.

He remembered a lot about his mother. Too much, in fact. The alcohol binges. The
beatings. The way shed sit in front of the TV smoking crack and watching infomercial.
The time the cops had to come to the house because shed set the dog on fire. Hed loved
that dog--Fluffy, his name had been, and there were times when hed been sure that he
was his only friend. The time she went into his closet and cut up all his clothes. The time
she stole the money hed saved up from his crappy evening job at the roller rink and
spent it all on nail extensions. The way her fat legs bulged inside her spandex stirrup
pants, so different from Penelopes slender frond like limbs. The way shed cut him down
all the time, laughing at him, telling him hed never amount to anything, never get
anywhere in the world.Well, ma, you arent laughing now, he asserted to himself. Im not
a pimply wimp anymore. Im a stud, a rich businessman, with a fabulous house and a
voluminous redheaded girlfriend and lots of friends. How does ya like them hamburgers?
Hed always wanted to shout those words into her fat face, her ugly fat hateful face with
its garish caked on makeup and glittery paste on eyelashes. But she died before any of the
good stuff happened and hed never gotten to yell it into her fat face like he wanted.
Shed choked to death on a cocktail frank while watching infomercial. Hed found her
there the next morning, stiff as beef jerky.
I remember all that, his thoughts continued, squashing the red meat between his fingers
like he was squashing his mothers throat. I remember it like it was yesterday. But not the
hamburgers. I...dont . . . remember . . . the hamburgers? Why? Why?
Sweetie, are you . . . , IS your OK? came Penelope Urbains soft voice, sliding into his
tortured thoughts like a cool shaft of evening rain into the fiery heart of hell. You look
like youre trying to crush it or something! she exclaimed worriedly.
Bruce Lucent gusted a sigh that siphoned up from the bottom of his heart and hoisted his
thoughts up out of the black stinking mineshaft of memory. Mom was dead. Shed never
laugh at him again. That part of his life was over. He didnt have to think about her now.
Who cared if he couldnt remember the hamburgers? Hed learned how to make them
himself. Yeah, ma! He affirmed.  A contemptuous smile squirming across his well shaped
lips. I learned it all myself!
Howdy folks! resounded a cheery voice from inside the house. We grilling yet?
Isadore Trent came striding out onto the patio, his washboard abs tight as a drum
underneath his skintight white tee shirt. His red hair in its ponytail hung down his strong
muscular back like the vibrant mane of a thoroughbred hose.
Isadore! cried Penelope, her soft tones vibrating joyfully.

Is . . . ,, is it you?

              One in the same! Isadore cried.

       Its . . . its so good to see you!

       Great to see you too, Pen! Isadore exclaimed, turning to Bruce. Say, Bruce,

great patties!

       Bruce Lucents head gave a stiff nod. He didnt like the way Penelope had said

hello to Isadore. Why was she so glad to see  him? She hardly knew hi m. Or at least . . .

he thought she hardly knew him.

       Guess Ill get these on the grill, he info rmed. The two of them didnt seem to

notice. He picked up the tray and walked ove r to the grill. Opening the grill, he put the
tray down on the table beside it and put the patties on the grill. They hissed and spattered

from the grill while behind his back Isadore and Penelope were talking about vegetables.

       Whats your favorite, Pen? Isadore wanted to know.

       Oh, I . . . I dont know, Penelope responded breathily. I...I think maybe lettuce.

Or a broccoli. I...I like them to be green.

       Bruce flipped the spluttering patties on the gr ill with an expert flick of his strong

wrist. Inside his chest, his hart seemed to splutter too.      Why were they talking about

vegetables? he wondered darkly.  Well, Penelope was a vegetarian . . . but he'd never

known that Isadore cared about things like that.

       Im an artichoke man myself, Isadore declared. Give me a good artichoke

anytime. You know . . .  his confident voice kicked down a notch. It's the way you have

to peel them. One leaf . . . after another . . . and by the time you get down to the heart, the

soft warm luscious gleaming heart, youre . . . ready. Really . . . ready.

       Isadore! Penelope fluttered with her  soft voice. I...I didnt know you were so

poetic.

       Theres lots of things you dont know        about me, Pen, Isadore asserted

confidently. Lots of things.

       This is  wrong, but Bruce's thoughts told hi  m. It was all going wrong. And he

didnt know why.

       Bruce Lucent piled the now-over-cooked patties back onto the tray and carried

them over to the patio table where Isador e and Penelope were now laughing hardily at

something Isadore had said. He banged the  tray down on the table, the glass making a

ringing sound that echoed the ringing that was  sounding in his ears. A ringing of fury. A
ringing of despair. He was losing her, but   he knew it. Last night had been an illusion.

Some briefs spurt of happiness that was all. It hadnt meant anything--not to her. It was

all going wrong.

       There, he growled, his tone of voice    betraying his deep seeded anger. The

burgers are cooked.

       Penelope drew back from his rough beha vior, her lovely face shaping itself into

puzzled lines. Honey, she ventured, you . . . you sound so angry.

       Im not angry! Bruce denied. Pulling   out his wrought iron patio chair with a

clatter, he hurled himself down onto it, his  actions contra punting his words. He shoved

the tray toward them. Go on. Eat them.

       Isadore surged to his feet, his rock    -hard muscles rippling and his red tail

bouncing. I dont think Pen wants to, he barked.

       Oh no? Bruce shot back. And how would you know?

       Because, Isadore tilted forward, his eyes clutching Bruces like pincers, his tone

low and menacing.  I know shes a vegetarian. Whic h you, my friends, seem to have

forgotten.

       Penelope let out a soft gasp. Bruce sat like  a statue turned to stone feeling despair

engulf him like a black blanket of horro r dragging itself over all his senses.   Isadore is

right, he acknowledged to himself in heart rendering misery. I did forget. Its all my fault.

       Ready to go, Pen? Isadore demanded masterfully.

       I...I guess so, she hesitated.

       Isadore gave Penelope his arm, his ro ck-hard biceps bulging under the sleeve of

his white tee shirt like potatoes in a flour   sack. Hesitatingly she took it. Together they
strode out of the patio and vanished into the night, leaving Bruce s itting forlornly at the

table staring at the hamburger patties on their tray, smoking like the charred ashes of his

dreams, while inside his head he was listening to his mothers laughter.
                                        12

       The reception was a disaster for Callie from the moment she stepped into the hall.

Clearly famished from weeks of living on Xena drin and Diet Pepsi, she made a beeline

for the appetizers.  The Swedish meatballs   were obviously the most fatty thing on the

table.  To her dilated pupils those little red  tinged morsels of mad cow must have looked

like manna in the making.  But as soon as  she picked up a tasseled toothpick, the damn

meatball launched itself off the stick and made its sticky, greasy, ambling way down the

corset of her Vera Wang bridal gown, over all that hand crocheted tulle, and splattered its

death throes on the open toe of her Jimmy Choo shoes.

       The bride backed away from the table,  letting out a strangled gurgle and waving

her French manicured fingers in the air.   She began hyperventilating.  A cadre of caterers

descended upon her, seltzer, bleached linen napkins, and industrial strength cleansers at
the ready. Those wedding pictures were goi ng to have to be photoshopped for days to

make that dress ever look ivory again.

        I backed up, trying to hide the fact that  I was laughing so hard I was afraid I was

going to spray shrimp cocktail all over my Ma nolo Blahniks.  Of course, I backed right

into Richard Isaacs.  We hadnt said three   words to each other at the church, but Id

immediately spotted him there.  His Armani  suit was so sharply pressed I imagined you

could cut cheese with the creases.  Being a stock manipulator, and a police stoolie, hed

probably stolen more cheeses than hed cut.  Still, it was hard to ignore his ruddy, good

looks.   I knew he had a yacht anchored on the Outerbanks, and his aftershave helped his

allure by retaining a hint of sea air. The blue  in his Ralph Lauren tie made his eyes seem

more piercing, and the gray encroaching ar ound his temples had yet to establish a firm

beachhead on the rest of his scalp.

       Yvonne, he said, in a gravelly voice that  hinted of a two-pack a day habit only

recently dropped.  I was hoping I would bump into you.

       Rub up against me was more like it.  He hadnt moved more than a millimeter

since my well-toned derriere had grazed his hi p.  We both watched in silent amusement

as Callies groom, Bruce, forced his way through the sea of starched aprons to comfort

his fainting flower of a bride.

       Now Bruce, I heard the frail flower   snap.  You just go away and let these

professionals do their work.  Go get mah Aunt Eustace some champagne.

       Dutifully, Bruce left Callie to her sta  ff and went to get some liquor for Aunt

Eustace.
       Echoing what I was thinking, Richard wh ispered, Do you think she sent him to

the oldest, ugliest broad here because shes already afraid of comparisons to younger,

prettier company?  Here he patted me on my  back as if to let me know who the young,

pretty, company was.

       Now Callies only got maybe five years on  me.  And I know for a fact that shes

still got all her natural software and she keeps it in good shape at the gym.  Being a lady I

would never mention some of her other habits.  Besides, whats a little Botox between us

girls?  Still, I was flattered that Rich ard would include me with the younger set.

Considering Callie was totally robbing the cr adle marrying dear, little Bruce (for Gawds

sake, shes old enough to be his Mother!) I wa s enjoying Richards attention. Of course,

hes old enough to be my father.  But lets just say I like them with a little steel in their

girders.  Plus he still has shoulders you could hang a lion off of.

       I decided to go for the gusto.  So, Richar d, I said.  Think you can help me with

a little problem Im having?

       Richard backed up a few inches.   What did he think I was going to ask him for?

Help with insurance?  Stocks tips?  What to do about some incorrigible STD?

       I lost my navel ring. Somewhere over by  the gift table.  I was hoping you could

help me look for it.

       His eyes lit up with a predatory gleam.   I hoped it wasnt just the idea of finding

gold.  I planned to have him panning for more  than a little circle.  I was looking for the

big O myself.

       Over at the gift table I did a full bend ove r to scan the floor.  From his position I

was sure he couldnt miss a good gander at my leopard thong.  It didnt really go with the
fuchsia bridesmaids confection I was stuck in, but I felt it added a little  je ne sais quoi to

a rather dowdy outfit.  Besides, it set off my  auburn tresses better than fuchsia.  Fuchsia,

for Gawds sake.  Callie wasnt being shy a  bout trying to make all us other girls look

bad!

       Ah, but back to my prey.  Its just a little  old, navel ring with an emerald on it.  I

heard it go clink when I dropped Callies gift    off.  I felt I needed some fortification

before hunting under the table for it.  Here,  I raised my glass of Veuve Clicquot, and he

gallantly clinked his Baccarat crystal agains t mine. Care to help me look?  I asked,

straightening up and giving him the benefit of my fully bleached smile.

       He gave me a frank, appraising stare.   At least I hope the stare was for me.  He

could have been tallying up how much silver and how many checks there were lying on

that big, round, table, but I suspected the thought of my thong was more enticing.

       Coming? I asked, holding up a corner of  the tablecloth. Taking a quick glance

around the room, I saw that only a bemuse     d waiter, who was holding his champagne

bottle at the ready, was watching us.  All the other guests were too involved with the

dress drama to give our portion of the room a gander

       Without looking to see if he would follow, I crawled under the table.  Fortunately,

the cream carpeting was very thick.  Now Id see what he was made of.  If he was as

stuffed as his shirt, he would probably beat a quick retreat from such a silly situation.

       I held my breath for a few moments.  Just  as I was starting to feel really foolish, I

heard him enter our little domain from the r  ear.  He was awkwardly clutching a nearly

full bottle of champagne.
       I brought reinforcements, he said, as he poured more bubbly into my glass.  In

case we get stuck here for a while and need to fortify ourselves for the search.

       Ah, a man after my own heart. All ready to liquor up for love.

       We clinked glasses again.

       Now what exactly are we looking for? he asked with a grin.

       Oh, just a little golden O, I say.  Its   got a bit of green emerald, just like my

eyes.  I batted my eyelashes at him, in case he had somehow failed to notice my

startlingly beautiful color.

       Encouraged by his attention, I continued.   First we pat the rug, I say.  Kicking

off my slingbacks, I run my feet seductively over the carpet and all around his pant leg.

       To his credit, Richard immediately took     off his shoes, and socks, and began

running his toes through the lush carpeting.    So what do we do when this doesnt

work? he asked.

       Well we can start crawling around looki  ng for it on hands and knees, I say.

Taking care not to bump my head on the bottom of the table, I yet again favored him with

a view of my pert derriere.  Leaving hi s shoes behind, he clam bered onto his own hands

and knees and followed me around.

       Ooh, I say.  Feel here.  I move his hand just over my knee. Is that something

we should be looking into further? I ask.

       I dont know, he responds, fondling my knee in earnest. Let me see if I can

find the gold.  In a move I would think was  practiced, if not for the awkward angles we

are at which keep our head from bopping on th  e table, he climbs swiftly over me, and

shoves his knees up between my legs. Let me see what I can feel, he whispers.  Moving
his hands up from my knees to run over my hi ps, then my tummy, they come to rest on

the points of my push-up bra.  He rubs     his fingers in concentric circles around my

breasts. I havent had such a thorough feel  since my last gyno exam.  And Richards

hands are mercifully warm.  His tongue reaches up to caress my ear.  I can feel him

nibble around the diamonds in my lobe.  Unable to resist I say, But what about my navel

ring?  One hand leaves my breast and tries    to find a way to enter my skintight dress.

When he cant find an easy entry, he reaches up under the skirt and pinches my belly

button.

       Your navel feels perfect without orname ntation, he whispers breathily in my

ear. But for engineering this rather unique experience, I promise to take you to Tiffanys

where you can pick out the emerald of your  choice. Unless, and here he pushes my bum

into the rug, leaning his full weight against me, so I can feel how ready he is for an

adventure. Unless, he says again, You want to roll around some more and see what we

can find.

       I struggle slightly, wondering when I lo st the upper hand in this seduction.  My

foot hits the champagne bottle and cold bubbly spills over, adding a tingly sensation to

my toes.  As his hand has now slipped from      my navel to my love shack, Im in no

position to do more than wiggle. I have to  muffle my moans by biting down hard on his

tie, because all around us I hear guests return ing to the room.  His hand moves inside of

me with the skill of many years of experience.    This is why I like my men with a little

steel in their girders, I think.  None of these pretty boys of Callies will ever know how to

do this so quickly or so well.
       The band finally stops playing that insipid Butterfly Kisses.  Trust Callie to

choose something so banal, and it moves on to   the Stones.  Richard seemed more than

ready to Pump me up.  He moved his hand from my boob and we were so close I could

feel the tension of the teeth as his zipper  slowly uncoiled.  When I felt his muscle move

against me I realized he had been going   commando.  I got wet just thinking about it.

Proving how strong he was he snapped the  reinforced lace waistband on my thong one-

handed.  As I felt his missile seeking my s ilo with all the power  of American know-how

behind it, I readied for the first strike.

       All of a sudden, I saw the unmistakably    cheap shoes of the champagne toting

waiter appear inches from my nose.  Ther e was a soft knock on the table over my head.

Cheesit, the jig is up, I heard the waiter   say.  Your champagne has soaked into the

tablecloth and theyre bringing over a new one, before all the gifts get wet.

       I moaned with frustration and rolled my   hips, trying to get a taste of Nirvana

before the world could stop my fun.  But   Richard was already rolling over and zipping

up. Another time, Ma Cherie, he said.  Without even a final kiss, he was gone.

       Ooh, hell pay for that,  I thought.  And gathering  up my thong, along with the

scattered threads of my dignity, I prepared to  dance my ass off for the rest of the night.
                                        

       The Atlanta rain came down hard and glitzy-blue and transparent in a gorgeous

murky haze over the bustling city, as the popular  and highly exclusive café reposed in its

cozy yet diffidently a corner nest along the  posh avenue lined with trees and littered with

pedestrians and people walking and their various and sun-dried pets.

       They sat at a table near the window, wa     tching the traffic and the gentle yet

soothing pitter patter of the little feet that sounded in their earlobes but that was the

purity of the rain.  Rain soothed and made gently the souls musings.

       Isadore Trent lazily perused the me       nu of this trendy place, filled with

extravagantly outrageous and overpriced items such as  foie de grass and pate.  The wine

list alone made his pocketbook shudder with     delicacy, but of course he pretended he
could afford it all and more and then he   merely put down the menu with a sniffling

disdain and addressed the companions across the table from him.

       What a great lunch, eh, Isaac?  What will you be having?

       Not sure yet, replied Isaac Stevens, the older man, hair close-trimmed and

distinctive and beard pepper-and-salt imposing, and gave a satisfied smirk and a wink.  I

think Id like to watch the scenery first.  I know how you and Bruce Lucent love this kind

of thing too.  Young rutting fellows that you   are.  And he motioned with a brave and

subtle rotation of his steady eyes, not toward the rainy window, but at the passing buxom

and slender waitresses and well-dressed  young women being seated a little away from

them, two tables down.  His eyes were visibly popping with sensual overloads.

       Yes, keep looking, old man, said Henry Archer in the empty seat next to them.

       Only Isadore could hear that voice,     ringing like a bell of the Notre Dame

Cathedral in his mind, and resounding in the dinnerware, and rebounding in the cutlery

and the window glass, for Henry Archer wa s dead and buried, his post-accident twisted

body rotting in his resplendent grave, for he c ould definitely afford it, and his wife Callie

whod inherited his millions, was just decent  enough to respect his last wishes regarding

his own corpse of his very self.  Callie, the frigid socialite arrogant woman.

       How is business, or should I even ask?   said Isadore, with his red hair pulled

back in a casual yet stylish ponytail, hard-bodied, and gushing sex appeal as only a 20-

year-old young man could, in his very prime of  existence and radical experience of life.

He had no need to stare at the women pa  ssing by, because they continuously stared at

him, watched his redheaded careless macho  yet a sensitive ponytail, his rippling muscles

concealed under neat casual wear.  He drew them like a magnet drew hungry flies.
       Thats what you think you are, said Henry Archer, the eternal voices in his very

mind. But you are not, you know.  You are not.  Not ever.

       The rain continued to beat down, first patter then come down in drizzles, and for a

moment Isadore was distracted enough by the  eternal rhythmic sound to gaze outside the

window, and just look at the sublime incandes cent beauty of the city nature flourishing

before him.  Weeping, crying, haze and silv ery shadows stood leaning in the air before

the window. A young passerby woman paused, lean ing to pick up a bag that fell into a

puddle, and for a moment she reminded him       of Irene with her long blond hair and

voluptuous straining body, oh so a ripe acacia-fragrant mouth.

       Yes, she was a hot number, that one,  mused Henry Archer, ghostly and virile

just below his ear, and across the table in that empty and ominous seat.

       Hush, bastard, you devil! Isadore wanted to say, but couldnt, because Irenes

father, Isaac Stevens would think he mad, or worse, he would begin to suspect.  Irene was

there in his mind, and so was Henry Archer who grinned in his suave manner, once again

reminding by his confident glossy white teeth why her had been his willing mistress and

lover.

       There is the matter of Richard Isaacs, of course, said Isaac suddenly and quietly

through the sedate thicket of his distinc tive beard, putting down the menu on top of the

plate and inadvertently making the water glass  clank gently and ricochet merrily against

the salad fork.

       Yes, I know.

       The rain pitter-pattered and there was silence in the noisy café, or maybe in their

minds.
       Silence.

       Noisy café noise.

       Moments later, their young strawberry-auburn-headed waitress attended them

with a pleasing winsome grin full of healthy  teeth and gums.  Her generous bosom swept

forward in her tightfitting blouse, unbuttoned  precariously and yet full of devious intent

to reveal the tender rosy heaving flesh under the starched straining cotton.

       What may I get you, gentlemen? she said in a honey pert voice, and a flash of

white pearly teeth in a face of unusual refine  ment for such a creature.  What was she

doing hear in this seething and empties a trendy morass of human dross and raging

worldly clamor?

       Ah, mused, Isadore to himself, She  is another unfortunate, probably alone in

the world and needing to pay her way in the world of men.  She may be writing a novel in

secret, and I know her kind. And he had an  immediate need to comfort and console her,

and felt a pang of desire in his southern regions of the hard young body.

       Give us another minute, honey, will you?   said Isaac, grinning at the waitress

and winking gently like an older man who is respectable, no doubt, yet has spent a wild

youth sowing his wild oats and a bit of wheat and barley too.

       Would you like some more water, sir?       said the nubile waitress, addressing

Isaac, but Isadore felt her posture straining to ward him like Jack toward the beanstalk of

his dreams.  He could almost read her eagerne ss to serve him, not the other.  The world

narrowed and spun, then receded like the glory of the outer rain and inner worldliness.

       Silence and moments of pitter-patter.
       You are the one with a sex-death wis    h, hissed Henry Archer in his ghostly

presence permeating the room. Just look at her, you know she wants you.  They all want

you.  Except Irene!  You could never have her, because she will always be mine.  She

cannot ever forget my youthful bodybuilder physique, the firmness and the rock-hardness

of me, the only things that would satisf  y. Her father does not know that his sweet

innocent Irene was a wildcat in my bed.  I   could always make her mew.  And to my

musical key, none other.  She purred for me  like a bobcat kitten before it became fully

grown, gained poundage and muscle bulk, and  discovered other wildlife of its kind and

ilk.  Vibrant, innocent but sensual, purring. Ever purring for me, she was

       Actually, I think I am ready to order now , said Isadore, firmly ignoring it all,

flipping back his red forelocks out of his  face and beyond the back to where the bulk of

the abundant and suggestive ponytail rested against his wide strongly utterly virile back 

a back that could do the beast with two back s so well, when one of the two backs came

into question and under scrutiny (but the ot her back of course depended on the woman

writhing with him, under him and on top of him ah, the beasts they would make!).

       He ignored the voice of Henry Archer and the ghostly vacant and evacuated

presence among them, and concentrated on  thoughts of lunch and  thoughts of Richard

Isaacs, while retracting and folding away a ll distracting thoughts such as Irenes blond

fairness to the back of his subconscious mentality.

       We really should talk to Richard about  his behavior, said Isaacs low baritone

while the waitress deftly and smoothly poured   water over his shoulder into Isadores

glass and then Isaacs glass.  Her bosom was  almost spilling outside and the depth of her
cleavage was undeniable, like the depths of    the liquid in the clear cool jug and the

profundity of the dripping rain outside.

       Isadore visibly forced himself to     unglue his eyes from the panorama of

mummeries and femininity, and said, I will have the lightly-braised spring lamb  au jus,

and a vinaigrette au coq.

       Would you like soup or salad? said the  waitress in a breathless soprano.  Her

impressive mammary watch was inches away from Isaacs distinctive bearded face.

       Salad, please, and what kind of dressi ng do you have? said Isadore, lifting his

sensual narrowed eyes from his table se tting and allowing them free reign and bounce

over her lovely face.

       We have French, Italian, Sun-ripened tomato and Avocado, Thousand Islands,

honey mustard, low-cal French, low-cal Ita lian, low-cal Thousand Island, Oriental Thai

Oregano, and a house dressing with secret ingredients, which I highly recommend --

       Go ahead, order the French, mocked Henry Archer.  You know Irenes French

kisses were sublime and yes I tasted them repeatedly and dolefully.

       Low-cal Italian, said Isadore, neve r blinking, yet narrowing his eyes and then

widening them in involuntary but firm pup il dilation and watching the wavelength and

frequency of her eyes, so that the waitress wa s the first one to blink away, but first she

heaved her chest in an automotive reflex that was not to be denied.

       As I was saying, Richard has gone too far at this point, interjected Isaac

Stevens, pulling down the white linen napkin   sterile like Cassie Archer yet pure like

Irene Stevens  on his lap. I saw him the ot her day at the Racquet Club, and he looked

pale and just sick withexhaustion.  Wonder whats the matter this time.
       The waitress jotted down Isadores order,  then looked at Isaac with the patience

of a saint who has to work tables in order  to support a family and possibly just a writing

habits, not to mention, pay bills and federal taxes.

       Isadore picked up his water glass ruefull y, considering what was within, a cousin

of the rain pattering on the window, and drew  the parallel between the microcosm in the

glass and the macro cosmos outside.

       No, one is pure, not even the rain, said Henry Archers hateful ghostly voice.

       Isadores fingers shook so that in that moment he spilled some of the cool and

refreshing once tap but now double-filtered c    ontents of the glass -- just droplets of

mountain-spring purity -- onto his shirt. Ah!  Isadore exclaimed, and grabbed a napkin

to dab at his shirt in some confusion,    while Isaac and the waitress, and the whole

restaurant, and possibly the whole world star ed at him, and the moment extended itself

into eternity and then redoubled upon itself  like the emulsifying and moisturizing nature

of the rain.

       In the empty seat across the table, Henry Archer cackled like an evil genie

without a bottle to return to, nor needing one , since he was fully dead, and Isadore could

make himself believe it at long last.

       His spirit and conscience hung boldly in the air while the rain outside continued

to come down in the greatest flood.

       And Isadore suddenly felt himself refres hed and free of shame and guilt and able

to speak at last.

       He opened his mouth, cleared his throat      , swallowed the past, digested the

moment, and started to honestly speak to Isaac Stevens about Richard Isaacs.
       In the deepest closet back of his mind, how ever, there will always be the rain and

Irene with her raining liquid blond hair, th  e complex daughter of his lunch companion

and confidante.

       The rain came down.

       Oh, joyous yet serene emancipated rain.
                                       

       Penelope sat, sipping a Peach Martini (her third) while the staff hustled all around

her table. She hadn't been back to Atlantas Food 101 restaurant since graduating college,

but it had the merits of terrific food, no loud  music, and excellent bartender, and, above

all else, there was absolutely no connection  to her time with Bruce. She had no few fond

memories of the place, and the memories were justified. Just since she'd arrived, no fewer

than 3 guys (2 Pro hockey players and a Minor  League pitcher) had hit on her. Once, she

would have enjoyed their attentions. Now, she was impatiently awaiting Andrea's arrival.

       Andrea who never came on time unless sh e happened to be laying on someones

watch during sex. Andrea who was gorgeous in   ways even Penelope could appreciate,

since Bruce had never given Andrea a second  glance. Yet, she was engaged to Bruces
college roommate, Jeff, and still had managed to retain her friendship with Penelope

despite Jeffs requests not to.

       Penelope was just signaling her buff, young  waiter Greg to bring another Martini

when Andrea appeared, striding swift toward  her table. Her lean, 5-6 frame and dancers

leg with calves pulling tautly as she appr oached, had heads turning up-and-down the

aisle. When she bent over and kissed Penel ope on the cheek, 2 guys nearly fell off their

chairs, and another received a vicious, teeth-rattling smack from his female companion.

       Andrea was breathless, causing her chest to  heave enough to sea sicken even the

mightiest of sailors. "I'm so sorry I'm late.  We were in a planning meeting this morning

when the main server failed, and it's been nonstop phone time with our clients all day."

So spoke Ms. Temporary Secretary.

       Penelope waved over Greg. "It's OK. Let' s just get you a drink." Within moments

there were delivered 2 Peach Martini, and a Sex on The Beach for Andrea. The women

sipped and made small talk over a plate of appetizers, though Penelope was itching to get

to her main concern.

       Penelope's simple Caesar Salad and Andrea's North Georgia Trout had finally

arrived when she finally broached the main issue. "Are you going to tell me? Or are we

both going to pretend it never happened?"

       Andrea said with a sigh, "How about le t's do that, Penny? It's done. Terminado.

Do we have to go through all the details? The Pre-Nup is singed, the rings are exchanged,

and the gift checks cashed. Let it go. Let him go."

       Penelope shook her head, her ponytail wavi ng behind her as if to swat a platoon

of troublesome flies. "I need to  hear it, Andrea. I need to hear it for myself before I can
relegate him to the arms of that wo   man, and move on. Once you tell me about the

wedding, I can put Bruce behind me for good." A  small, childlike part of her petulantly

crossed the dainty fingers of her left hand where it lay out of sight in her lap.

       Andrea took a deep breath that nearly shattered the already precarious equilibrium

of her blouse's buttons. "All right. If you rea lly need to torture yourself, I will. The

ceremony and reception were held at the Archer place."

       Penelope snorted. "It was probably as much an exorcism of her husband's spirit as

it was a wedding."

       Andrea raised her hand with all the author ity of a 20-year veteran school crossing

guard on a rainy Spring afternoon. "If you're    going to be like that, I'm not going to

continue. Jeff isn't thrilled that you and I are  still friends, but out of respect for me, lets

just get this over with."

       Penelope nodded. "Sorry. Go on."

       Andrea nibbled as she spoke, covering the initially distasteful taste of the tale

with the smoky richness of restaurants' speci   al recipe BBQ sauce. "There were only

about 50 guests, mostly on Bruce's side. Ca  llie doesn't have much family, and I guess

most of her guests were business associates from Archer's business."

       Andrea paused for a sip of Sex before   plunging on with all the subtlety of the

neckline of her favorite blouse. "Before you ru in this already awkward story, yes, Callie

wore white. And her bouquet was Calla Lillies.  Cute touch, no? That Personal Assistant

of hers . . .  Maude? ... Milicent? ... whoever .  . .   was the Maid of Honor. Bruce and Jeff

wore gray tuxes, with white sneakers. It was a very simple ceremony, and Bruce's mother

cried the whole time. To be honest, I half-e xpected you to jump out of the shrubbery, or
from a helicopter, or something screaming S top this mockery of a marriage! when the

minister asked if anyone knew any reason why these two should not be married.

       Penelope glowered a bit, but Andrea rushed ahead having warmed greatly to her

tale. "Jeff gave a marvelous toast. He told   that story about the night Bruce and those

basketball players stole all the bread that had  been delivered to the college cafeteria, and

there was no bread for meals the next day, and how he woke Jeff at 3 a.m., and clobbered

him with a loaf of French bread, and there was bread all over the floor of their room, and

Jeff ended up cleaning it up, but how they've stay  ed friends ever since. That story still

cracks me up, though I guess it's more touching  now that I see what a bonding moment it

was for them."

       Penelope waited while Andrea finished o  ff the last of her ribs. Much as she

generally liked Andrea, the girl had a certa  in flighty -- no, make that "airheaded" --

quality to her personality that was scratching at Penelope's nerves like a cat with 7 paws

in a sofa factory. Why couldn't she see that Bruce's marriage was not a subject to be taken

humorously.

       Andrea let out a burp, not so manly a belch  as to attract undue attention to them,

but not so ladylike that one or two heads di d not turn their way again. Wiping her mouth

delicately and fiddling about with the few ti ny fish bones on her plate, she went blithely

on. And their vows were so lovely, Penny. Th  ey wrote them themselves, and I never

knew a computer geek like Bruce could be so eloquent. Callie went first, and she said the

loveliest things about Bruce and them and  their relationship. How he had pulled her up

from the deepest depths of her mourning, and given her reason to rise from her bed in the
morning light, and yet still more and greater r eason to return to it at nightfall. She swore

to love him all the days of his life.

       Penelopes mind decided this was a fine   moment to play heckler to this divine

comedy. Wonderful. She means to outlive this husband, too!

       Andrea was oblivious to this bleak inte rnal exchange. And Bruces vows. Oh,

Penny! You would have been so proud to hear him say such things. He went on about

how Callie was the Tech Support Agent who       had taken him off a Musales Hold and

brought him through the ultimate upgrade of the Operating System of his heart, and made

his thus-far sad and lonely existence 100%     compatible with life, the universe and

everything. I was so moved I made Jeff quote every tech specification he could remember

while we made love that night. You have no  idea how hot that stuff can make a girl! We

should try to get you a computer nerd of your own.

       Penelope barely registered the last of Andreas tale, as the harsh reality of the

situation struck her with all the destructive force of reality. Bruce had no feelings for her.

That demanding woman had rebooted his me  mory, erasing all the good, warm, tender

history theyd shared. She was nothing but a part  of that sad and lonely existence from

which he was fleeing. He felt nothing for the   time theyd shared. Nothing for all the

amazingly raunchy and kinky things shed allo wed him to do to her (or had she do to

him) when his Internet explorations had in troduced him to one of the many particularly

exotic forms of foreplay that had kept  them abed on many a night, and many a feigned

sick day from work.

       Penelopes vision slowly closed in on he r, leaving her finally aware of only two

things: Andrea licking her lips while describing the decadently delicious German Black
Forest wedding cake.  The thought  Why did Henry Archer have to die? Why couldnt it

have been Bruce?  With that, she lapsed into unconsciousness, earning a bruise on her

forehead from her fork, and a crouton up her   nose before buff Greg carried her to the

managers office, and called 911.
                                       

       Less than sixty seconds after she'd come  through the front door at Bruce Lucent

and Callie Archer's wedding reception,     Yvonne Perrin knew she was in trouble.

       "Hey there! How's my very favoritest bridesmaid?"

       Yvonne looked around just in time to dodge a beefy-faced and obviously drunk

man who was trying to kiss her.

       "I'm not                                                                       -"

       "You remember me-I'm Uncle Roger!" he said. "I was at the rehearsal dinner." He

tottered slightly, then pulled a mashed-l  ooking disposable camera out of his pocket.

"Let's get one of these nice people           to take our picture together, huh?"

       She knew how  that would work: he'd get his arm around her for a good long

grope and a couple of wet kisses, while some  other hapless guest took forever to figure
out the camera's dead-simple controls. She priv ately vowed that if she couldn't get out of

it, she was going to do the whole thing with   a lovely smile on her face and one of her

spike heels planted squarely in            the middle of Uncle Roger's foot.

       Mercifully, the little cellphone in her handba g chose that moment to start ringing.

She transferred the bag to her Uncle-Roge r-side hand, made an apologetic "just a sec"

face, and flipped open the phone.

       "Maria Lisa?"         said an unfamiliar voice.

Yvonne beamed. "Hi, honey! I've been looking for you, too."

       "Maria? Estas?                                                                 "

The guy on the phone sounded urgent. That wa     s probably why he'd dialed the wrong

number.

                          "Estoy en mi casa. Necesito ir a mi trabajo."

"They are? Right now?" Yvonne turned and made a  quick "this is going to take a teeny

bit longer" gesture to Uncle Roger, then went  back to the call. "Tell them to wait and I'll

be right there."

                     "Por favor, Maria--estoy muy tarde para mi trabajo."

                     "Sweetie, where are you? I'm right by the front door."

Yvonne stood on tiptoe and scanned the room, looking for a good escape route. The big

arched doorway over to her right looked prom ising. "Just tell me which way to go, and

I'll be there quick as a bunny," she told the guy.

               He let out a furious burst of idiomatic Spanish and hung up, hard.

"Thanks, honey, I'll be right there!" she caroled, and snapped the phone shut. "Gotta run,"

she told Uncle Roger, and took off through the crowd.
                                              * * *

She should have known, Yvonne reflected bitterly. God knows Callie had e-mailed her

enough pictures while the wedding was in its  planning stages. Trouble was, she'd never

been able to get the attachments to open. Th  ey were bin-hexed, or something like that.

Probably a virus.

But even without seeing the pictures, it should  have occurred to her that if anyone in the

world were capable of picking out non-sucky  bridesmaids' dresses, it was Callie. And so

she'd discovered, when she'd arrived at the  church and gotten a glimpse of them. They

weren't sucky at all. Not the problem.

"Oh lord," she'd said out loud. "It's pr      actically the same dress -- and hat!"

She'd had just enough time to dash back to    her car to grab a lightweight shawl she'd

providentially left lying on the back seat tw o weeks earlier, then come back and find an

out-of-the-way seat at the rear of the  church. During the ceremony, who'd be looking at

her anyway?

But that wasn't going to work during the r eception. At close range the shawl just looked

tatty, and when she was standing up it did not hing to camouflage the rest of her gown-so

distinctive, with its subtly off-shade organza overdress that looked like absolutely

nothing else being worn at the party          except by the bridesmaids, of course.

                                 Sometimes, life is just not fair.

                                              * * *

A few minutes later, Yvonne found what sh  e needed: An out-of-the-way dressing area

with a good mirror, in the pool house way over  on the other side of the grounds. It wasn't
exactly private, but it was around three corners from the poolhouse entrance, and the pool

house itself was reassuringly dark inside. Besi des, with all the guests still up at the main

house doing their initial meet-greet-and-congratulate, she had the place to herself.

       She switched on the overhead lights directly above the mirror and took a long

hard look at her dress. Would the organ  za come off without leaving the underdress in

rags? It seemed a shame to remove it--she'd   loved this dress--but consoled herself with

the thought that if six other women in their social circle had the exact same thing hanging

in their closets, she'd never have been able to wear it anyway.

       Yvonne unzipped the dress to her waist,  and took down her bodice so she could

look at its construction. She was in luck!  There, underneath the facing, was a neat little

row of hand-set stitches fastening the overdre ss to the underlying material. It must have

been designed to be removable all along. Sh e rummaged in her purse for the ornate little

silver pocketknife she'd inherited from he   r grandmother, then went to work ripping

stitches.

       The front came away easily, and the back was nearly as quick. That left the waist.

She looked around, sighed, shrugged, and              peeled her dress off entirely.

       When she was done, she bundled up the remains and put her dress back on to see

what she had. "Less dress; that's for sure," sh e said aloud to the mirror. It was still pretty,

but now it showed far more skin; and with the organza draping gone, she'd had to forego

her bra and its attached slip. She shimmied her shoulders experimentally and watched the

effect. She didn't                        quite            fall out.

       The matching organza sunhat would have  to go as well. Before, it had matched

the dress perfectly. Now all it matched was the oddly forlorn-looking roll of fabric she'd
tucked safely away on a high shelf. Yvonne   started carefully removing the hatpins that

had secured the hat to her elaborate hairdo.

       The minute the hat was off, her glossy  red hair came tumbling down around her

back and shoulders. Yvonne sighed in exasperation. In this humidity, she could see it was

already starting to curl. She twisted the unrul y red hank into a loose knot at the nape of

her neck, tying it off with the hatband and cl  uster of silk flowers from her castoff hat.

       "Very nice," a male voice said lazily from  somewhere behind her. "It says a lot

for a dress that I don't mind seeing you put it back on."

       Yvonne gasped and whirled around, looking  for the source of the voice while she

groped behind her for her long hatpins. "Who-"

       "Sorry," said the voice. There was the  ratcheting click of a Zippo lighter, and in

the brief flare of its light she saw an older man in formal wear sitting in an ornate high-

backed wicker armchair. Then the lighter     clicked shut, and all she could see in the

shadows was the red glow at the end of his cigarillo.

"How long have you---" she began, then        stopped. "I'd have heard you come in."

       "I'm afraid so," he said. "I'll have to beg your pardon. I had just finished making a

phone call when you walked in."

       "In the               dark              ?" she said.

       "Not too dark to make a phone call.        You're blinded by those overheads."

Inside her head, an inane little voice was busily calculating  I had the slip on when I took

the dress off, I put the dress back on over the slip, I pulled the slip off over my head while

I still had the dress on, he didn't see much --  Another voice was saying formal wear, he's

either a guest or he's an employee who has so mething to lose, still not safe but maybe I'll
be okay, keep him talking, where's my knife where's my phone --     And something that

wasn't exactly a voice was thinking something like                       Mmmmmm?

       "I expect you're right." She walked over to the switch plate and turned on the rest

of the room lights.

       The mysterious man in the chair now  looked less mysterious, but perhaps more

intriguing: wide shoulders, narrow wais t, a ruddy complexion; not young, but neither

afraid of nor defeated by his age. He looked, she suddenly thought, like a man who was

lightly sparring with his age, and enjoyi ng the fight. His suit was perfectly tailored.  He

never rented that suit   , she thought;   not with his build    . She approved of both.

       The man returned her attention, studying her as she did him. He looked pleased.

Yvonne felt herself blushing, and the vexations and frantic pace of the day evaporating as

though they'd never happened. She was in her thirties, her girlhood long behind her, and

she'd never lacked for male companionship;  but she suddenly felt that little pleasurable

dizziness of the dance beginning again, as always feeling like it was the first time in the

history of the world.

       The nice thing about being in your thirties,      she reflected,  is that you can

appreciate that feeling for what it's     worth, and not worry about what it isn't.

       Then memory kicked in. "Richard Isaacs," she said. "I've met you. One of Bruce

Lucent's parties."

       His smile widened. "Yvonne," he said. "I   didn't catch the rest of your name. It

was noisy. You were wearing green silk,   the exact shade of the philodendron hanging

behind you."    She laughed then, feeling absurdly  flattered, and walked across the room

to offer him her hand. "How do you do?" she      said. "I'm pleased to finally make your
acquaintance."

       He took her hand and held it lightly in hi  s own for a few seconds. "I'm afraid I

really am going to have to ask for your forgiveness," he said. "I should have said

something when you came in, but I didn't, and  after that I was fascinated. I had no idea

that women were capable of transformation on such short notice."

       "You mean my dress? I had to. I was ambushed."      "What kind of ambush makes

you take your dress apart?"

       As Yvonne walked back to the narrow shel f in front of the mirror to collect her

bits of belongings and stow them back her   purse, she said, "I cleverly deduce that you

weren't at the wedding ceremony."

       "You are correct. What did I miss?"

       "Bridesmaids. Six of them. Every one of  them wearing that same dress and hat."

       His jaw dropped. "My god. Isn't there some kind of law against that? Bridesmaids

aren't supposed to dress like human beings."

       "You'd think, wouldn't you?" Yvonne sai      d. "But Callie picked them out."

He shook his head; and then a thought struck him, and he began to laugh.

       Yvonne watched, feeling a little wary. "Share?" she asked.

       "I was just thinking that you're being terri bly brave. My first wife once wore the

same dress worn by just  one other woman at a party, and she sulked about it for a week

and a half. If she'd arrived to find           six  other women wearing her dress-"

       "Spontaneous human combustion," Yvonne said solemnly. "I'd always wondered

what caused it."             Then a brief silence fell between them, and she found herself

wondering self-consciously whether she was keeping him from the party. Just as she was
wondering whether she should say something about it, he said, "This is lovely, and so are

you--but should I ask whether I'm keeping you from the party?"

       "Oh!" she said, at once relieved and afra id she looked too relieved. "I was about

to ask you the same. I have no obligations, besides attending; and if I know Bruce and

Callie, this party will run through tomorrow morning. How about you?"      "I'm   here   for

the party. I do have one other item on my agenda , which is to try to have a conversation

with a former business associate of one of my former business associates. "He grimaced.

"A man named Roger. I don't know his last name. I'm supposed to recognize him from an

old snapshot they found in the files."

       "If it's the Uncle Roger I met as soon as I came in the door, you're too late."

       "He's left already?"

       "He's three sheets to the wind. That was   the other reason I came back here and

started hacking my dress apart."

Richard studied her bare shoulders. "And        this is supposed to discourage him?"

       "It's supposed to put a crimp in any furt  her rounds of 'Hey, sweetheart, didn't I

meet you at the rehearsal dinner."

       "Ah," he said. "Now I understand. You      took off your uniform and buried it."

       "Exactly. I'm a noncombatant. Now, shall I take a look at this snapshot of yours? I

think I'd recognize him if I saw him."

       Richard shook his head. "I left it behind."  He picked up a cane she hadn't noticed

he was carrying, and got up out of his chair. He was moving a little stiffly."I                don't

remember that from the party,"            Yvonne said. "When were you hurt?"

       "An auto accident. Nothing worth mentioning. I'll get over it; I just haven't yet.
He limped over to what Yvonne had taken for  a section of wall. "Could you turn out the

lights? There now. Good. This is a louvered  window. You can see most of the yard from

here. Tell me if you spot Uncle Roger."

       Richard started turning the crank that would open the louvers, and Yvonne came

and stood beside him. She abruptly reali zed she was close enough to smell him--a good

smell, hard work and clean skin and a hint   of Old Spice--and to feel the slight radiant

warmth of his body, there in the darkness. There was a single sharp knock in her chest, as

though her sternum had been kicked from the   inside, and for a moment she closed her

eyes and fought to keep her balance. Her heart was hammering so hard that she thought

he must surely be able to hear it.

       "There," he said, and she blinked; a nd shook her head a little, trying to clear it.

Outside the louvered window, the late afte  rnoon was turning into early evening. The

lamps strung up around the yard made little   pools of light in the dusk, and partygoers

clustered underneath them.

       Richard was right. You could see everything from here. She looked carefully,

mentally dividing up the area and thoroughly  scanning one section before moving on to

the next. And -- "There!"

                                      "You can see him?"

"Yes." She glanced up at Richard. He was staring out the window, his eyes fixed on some

object. She turned back to the scene. "Mediu m-blue suit, going bald?--over there, next to

the woman in the red caftan and all the gol d beads--see? That man who keeps bouncing

up on his toes when he talks?"

"Him, yes. I'd already thought so from seei  ng that picture. If he told you his name's
Roger, I'd say that just about settles it." He  watched a little longer. "Definitely too drunk

to talk to."

Then he turned to face her, and once mo     re she could feel her heart hammering. She

paused a moment, listening. There was a second sound mixed in with it. "I can hear your

heart beating," she whispered, and impulsively laid her hand on his chest. He put his arms

around her, and pulled her close; and then they kissed, and for a while the rest of the

universe went away.

When they broke off the kiss, the way he  looked down at her was like someone reading,

and he looked at her for a long time. "As a matter of fact, no," he said conversationally. "I

don't do this sort of thing often." He kissed her again. "And neither do you, he added.

"Thank you," Yvonne said. "I was about to sa  y something stupider than that. What do

you want to do?"

"A lot of things. Take my hand. You really can't see in the dark, can you? There's a door

over in the corner. It has a lock on it."

                                  "And on the other side of it?"

             "A big, lumpy old sofa and a dead TV set. And something even better."

"What's that?" she said, feeling for the wa ll. She heard the door open somewhere in front

of                                                                                    her.

"A fuse box switch that'll turn off the  power to the whole poorhouse. Nobody will come

bothering us if they have to make their way through a couple of unlit rooms to do it."

          "Oh, you are clever," she said. "Are you sure you haven't done this before?"

                "I'm sure. It's the sheer inspiration that's making me ingenious."

                                              * * *
     A long time later, he shifted position, kissed her neck and ear, and murmured "I lied."

           "Past pluperfect subjunctive," she said sleepily. "What did you lie about?"

                              "The 'not doing this very often' part."

                            "Already having some doubts about that."

"Shucks, ma'am, that weren't nothin'." He ran his finger slowly up the inside of her thigh,

starting from her knee, and smiled in satisfac  tion to feel her spine arch backward, and

hear her long soft gasp as she inhaled. "What  I meant to say," he continued, "is that I'm

not really committed to that interactive model."

"Is that so?" She squirmed slightly to get better leverage, then wrapped one leg around

his waist and tucked her heel into the small   of his back. "I think I can live with that."
                                        

       Yvonne felt a thrill as she was finally able to leave the expanse that was I-85 and

enter the four-lane road that is 316, the Atlanta Highway. She unconsciously began

singing the B-52s Love Shack to herself. She reflected joyously that she had passed the

CNN Center, Fulton County Stadium, and the  other relics of the days when Ted Turner

seemed to run a country, instead of trying to give all his money away to places such as

the United Nations. It isn't, she thought, that everything in Atlanta is named Peachtree

Somethingonly bad novelists believe thats o much as the city has moved beyond

Peach trees. That thought shifted the soundtrack of her mind to Aerosmith.

I'm not a Rag Doll myself,    she reaffirmed to herself.  Her thoughts moving to Rory

Edwards. Richard Isaacs had been a pleasan  t flingit had, after all, lasted one night

more than she had expected. She had ultimatel y (that second night) decided that even his
skill at selecting clothes that made him look five years younger was not enough. It would

not compensate for the fact that his life was  spent playing games, and that he would play

her for as long as he wanted. Her friend Su e Young had once told her, Every once in a

while, you just have to bend over and take it.  Sue had casually continued, being explicit

about where, and Yvonne had been appropriate ly offended. She also realized her friend

would never understand that sex was about pow er, not love. Putting yourself into such a

position would forever reduce your role in the relationship, until you both started hating

you for doing it.

       (Yvonne had seen articles that noted that some  hot tramps who might be seen as

her competition proclaimed their enjoyment of  that particular proclivity. She shuddered

at the thought, wondering idly if that m     eant that the next generation would be

romanticizing the Ordinary Housewife of   yesterlore. She couldn't romanticize women

who had thrived in the South by feeding their husbands high cholesterol foods and

encouraging them to go hunting and fishing in   all types of weather. The premature

deaths may have produced pensions, life insu   rance, and financial security, but steel

magnolias could only enjoy the second half of  their life, and then only when the affairs

of the first half went unacknowledged.)

       She drove toward the exurban area that a  llowed Atlanta to describe itself as a

metropolis. Even the namesAlpharetta, Mariettaindicated places where the Man of

the House kept the little woman. It was     as if the transition to soccer mom from

Ordinary Housewife had never occurred. Me  tropolitan Atlanta was more an extended

backwoods area than an accelerated city. Now that Turner had taken the cash, and the
suits in New York had destroyed much of  the rest of the empire, Yvonne wondered how

the next generation would fare.

       Not that she cared about the twenty-somethings with tongue piercings. They were

a large reason she found her greatest successes with the Levitra generation. She preferred

men who no longer found drug-enhanced pleasures  of the flesh more important than a

woman who could keep them interested for      the half-hour or so before the drug was

effective. Her men were those whose definiti  on of foreplay largely consisted of being

able to look fondly, share a glass of expensiv e wine, and listen nostalgically to Doo-Wop

or other classic rock. Pleasant conversation and lubricated condoms did the rest.

       Today, thinking of Rory, Yvonne pondered   what to wear. She approached the

well-monikered Commerce, with its delightfu  l selection of stores. She even enjoyed

watching those daddy's little cuties spend far too much at Petite Sophisticate and J. Crew

on clothes that did far too little for them. N ot, she reflected uncharitably,  that they need

their clothes to do as much for them as I do.

       She imagined how she would approach Rory. She would shyly reach out, the very

model of an ingénue, which both of them w  ould believe for the moment she was. She

would seductively remove his glasses from hi s face. Should she speak? What is the male

equivalent of You're beautiful without your  glasses? No, just to act silently would be

better.

       She would move simply. Gently touch him her fingers, hinting of nail. Caress that

solid torso. Add a heartfelt c oo about how strong he must be. To tilt her head slightly,

hinting at supplication. He should see worshi  p in her eyes. To slowly move her other

hand to his Grecian-formula temples, running the fingers (more nail this time) through it.
To exalt how impressive it is that his hair   is still intact, while widening her grin to

highlight her White Stripes teeth. (Should she show a hint of tongue?)

       Finally, there would be a slow, apparently natural, motion of the hand from hair to

removing the glasses. Is he nearsighted? His ag e hinted not. He would still be able to see

her. She decided to proceed directly to m oving the glasses slowly down to her side, and

rub them with her blouse as if cleaning them  thoroughly, forcing his eyes to travel down

her body? Another tap of his fabulous torso, lingering this time with a comment about his

not needing the Vaseline and oils of a Stall one. She would note his lack of love handles

while tilting her own torso to highlight her gl  orious 38Ds. They were impressive, she

knew, even now when they were no longer supported by nature.  Thank God for Howard

Hughes, she mused.  If he'd gone for those boy-girls, instead of Jane Russell, women's

rights would have been set back twenty years.

       Yvonne pulled into the Tangers Outlet Mall,  reassuring herself that Rory would

not track fashions intensely, the way Richard does. (She remembered the pivotal scene in

some clothing movie, where the blonde wo  man catches the man knowing fashion and

realizes he is gay. She could not, for the hundredth time, consider Richard in those terms.

Rejecting the possibility again, for the hundredth time, she tried to concentrate on Rory

Edwards.

She was distracted by the list of things she  needed to buy, clear from her scenario. There

would be a tasteful-shade-of-red nail polis  h, lip gloss, hand cream, moisturizer, tooth

polish, and a flavored mouthwash. For the la    tter, she contemplated mint, but had a

breakthrough with the idea of cinnamon, something to surprise him.
       She considered a touch of dye,  not that I need it , but gloried once again in her

glowing auburn tresses. Her mother clai      med she had inherited them from her

grandmother. She decided a green hair clip,  which would also highlight her eyes, would

be sufficient.

       But the most important part was the outfit.  If she was going to be rail meat on his

yacht, she would have to look the part, and nothing in her wardrobe was quite perfect yet.

There was a purple silk blouse from she   had bought at Neimann Marcus, but she had

worn it to a party of Callie's three years a  go. She was afraid Rory had been there and

would remember it. She couldn't remember hi m from that party, but had been during her

enchantment by Calvin. And men claim only women are bewitching.

       She skirted past the Georgia Tech and UGA girls grabbing last year's halter-tops

and tube dresses for the coming summer.   While she fancied that her body could still

support a tube dress, she needed something more traditional for Rory. There was no point

in emphasizing the difference in their ages, trivial though she thought of it. She knew this

quest well, given her natural proclivity toward men who could legitimately be considered

late middle aged, old enough to know bette r, but careful enough about their bodies to

keep them in peak shape. This expedition re quired an outfit that would have been daring

in his day, but would appear restrained    among what currently passed for fashion.

Which meant a bright green dress (the hair      clip would have to be purple), fishnet

stockings, and, most importantly, a good-fitting push-up bra.

       So, it was to the bra shopping first. She wanted a nice lace, wondering if black

would be too daring and rejecting red out     of hand. Perhaps white would be safer,

especially since the dress was likely to be a bit translucent.
       Selecting a bra , she thought,  is one of those tasks that  makes women wish for a

penis, a flat chest, or both.  The hours she had wasted in ju st the past few years, not to

mention all those she expected to waste over  the next several decades were frightening.

Not even two bras of supposedly the same  size and make would fit wellor, often, even

similarly. And two different labels were a su re sign that a 38D would be a 40E would be

a 36C. Heaven help her when she realized that  Calvin had been correct in saying that her

left breast was smaller than her right. Bra  shopping was like trying two pairs of shoes to

make one pair.

Still, whether it was Life with Rory or there was some Mr. Right who followed him in

her pantheon, this roundelay would not end. Even while her plan was still hatching and

the glories of an anticipated seduction c ould still be savored, Yvonne suspected this

would not be her last relationship.

       Exhausted before she began, she eschewed  the Leggs Hanes Bali Playtex store

for Claires. Yvonne searched first for a Nu  Bra. She knew that Playtex might be the

result of her search for something to    signal a longer term, traditional woman. The

temptation of going strapless and backless   in the world of A-cups, WonderBra, and

plastic surgery for 54-year-olds was tempting, though.

       The result she finally found was worth the effort. Black lace top, solid white cups,

support, comfortable sweat-absorbing interior, a nd a silk exterior for that first maneuver

of his hand. Even that it had been made in China, where all of the women who worked on

it probably did not measure to her own endowment, did not stop Yvonne from wondering

at the marvels of modern American culture.
       The bra found, she moved on to Elisabeth      for dresses, glorying again that her

flowing locks meant that she really had but  two basic choices in color, green or purple.

And the climate of Atlanta allowed either colo r to appear appropriate at least ten months

out of the year, setting herself off against   the verdant landscape and the glories of the

sunsets as if it were natural, instead of  planned down to the hour. She thought ruefully of

the fashion disaster that would have come   from living in Chicago, where Calvin now

cohabited with his not-even-a-handful trust-fund bimbo.

       She considered the timing of her impending liaison and decided she should take a

Lavender Sunset approach to the evening.     A 7:30 meeting could be leveraged to its

fullest. His view as she approached their   outdoor table, fashionably late, would be of

herself set off by the glowing yellow-red b ackdrop and highlighted by the verdancy of

the surrounding deciduous trees.

       She decided this meant that her hair would have to be down and around her

shoulders. Maybe a flowerlilac? daisy?--instead of a hair clip. It would appear

positively antebellum, with a hint of knowing couture.

       A lavender Donna Karan, with a neckline that did not plunge so much as

gracefully hint (well, it may have been in  tended to gracefully hint, but her pulchritude

always more favored grace than hinting), tapered at the waist to highlight the firms of her

hips and derriere, ending slightly below the knee to show her calves off in good stead

while hiding the scars from the skiing accident  that had caused her to meet Calvin at that

lodge in Vail, selected, Yvonne left the store, wet with both the success of the expedition

and the anticipation of the night to come.

                                         

       Andrew Venice parked his car on the street in front of the house and double-

checked the address he had written down on a slip of paper.  Yeah, this was the place all

right.  It was an ordinary house, on an ordinary street.  There was nothing special about

it, just plain.  Nothing here looked like it might be connected to murder or assault or

anything like that.  Richard Isaac, the man      hed come to interview, was a stock

manipulator, and youd think hed live in a fancier place, a nicer house, on a better street.

But since he was also a police informant, maybe he wanted to keep a low profile, not do

anything to stand out.  Not exactly like the witnesses' protection program, but not all that

different.  Or maybe he just wasnt that good at manipulating stocks.  Venice would try to

find out, in addition to finding out what he really came here to ask about.
       He put the note on the front seat, and hi  s sunglasses in the glove compartment,

checking his reflection in the rearview mirror and smoothing back his hair.  Turning forty

was hard.  He didnt know what hed been planning to do at forty, but he was damn sure

this wasnt it.  Oh well.  It was his job, and he was the one to do it.  Hed better get going,

ask his questions, make his report.  Then hed have time to stop by the gym later, work

out a bit, fight off the ravages of time.  He was still in his prime, even if he had to work

harder to maintain it.

       Getting out of the car, he looked both ways, then shut the door and used the

keyfob to lock all the doors.  It wasnt  a bad neighborhood or anyt hing like that, but he

still didnt want to take any chances.  He let a minivan go past, then an SUV, then he

walked around the front of his car and up the  long sidewalk to the porch.  A bench sat on

the porch, the kind you might sit on and drink some lemonade, but it didnt look used,

like nobody had had any lemonade to drink there for a while, or maybe they just didnt

like the porch or something.  Isaacs probably had to keep a low profile anyway.  He

wasnt the kind of guy who spent a lot of time outside making friends with the neighbors.

       Venice went to knock on the door and stopped.  There was a flyer lying on the

welcome mat.  No, it was one of those bags   of advertisements they paid neighborhood

kids to deliver, one of those circulars.  there was a cardboard box full of them just off to

the side of the door.  He picked up the new  one and held it in his hand as he knocked on

the door with his knuckles, loud enough so       anyone inside could hear him but not

pounding or anything like that.  Watching his  reflection in the storm door, smoothing the

lapels on his suit jacket so hed be sure to look nice, the door opened.
       Richard Isaacs was the man who answered the door.  He looked over Venice

wondering who this guy was at  his door, and what he was doing there.  Venice got into

his pocket and pulled out his wallet, flipped it open to a show hid badge.

       Hi, my name is Andrew Venice, he said cheerfully, like there was nothing

unusual about him showing up there in the middle of the day.  Im here to ask you a few

questions.  Its no big deal.

       That was just what Venice wanted him to think, Isaacs thought.  They always said

it was no big deal when they were trying to nail you.

       I found this lying outside your door, Andrew said.  You want it?

       What was this guy trying to do, being friendl y to him.  No, just toss it there into

the circular file, Isaacs pointed.

       Toss it into where?

       That box right there beside the door,    he said, pointed to the box.  He was

getting mad.

       Its not a circle, its more of a square, said Venice.  Or a rectangle maybe.

       Its a joke, all right?  Now Issacs was r eally really mad.  I put the circulars in

the circular file.

       But that crazy Venice guy just offere  d it again.  You sure you dont want it.

They got good deals inside, could save you some money.

       Just throw it away.  I wish the kids would stop delivering them.

       Hey, listen, said Venice, sticking his ha nds into his pockets.  I dont have all

day here.  Im on an investigation.  I came   to ask you some important questions, and I

want some answers.
       I dont have to answer anything you ask!  Richard Isaacs replied forcefully.  He

wanted to make a point.  Are you going to st ay out there on the porch and scare off all

the neighbors or you going to come inside?

       Ill come inside and ask you my questions there.  I want to ask you about

Margaret Eastman.

       Issacs knew he was going to be regretti   ng this later.  But he said, Come on

inside anyway.  Even though he didnt want the guy inside.  But what were you going to

do?  Thats what they expected from you once you got messed up with the police.  But he

didnt have to play their game.

       Venice walked into the living room, not  sure what to expect.  Something about

Isaacs didnt add up right.  Either he wa     s living in a plain house in this plain

neighborhood because of frugality, because he     was cheap, or there was some other

reason.  He couldnt figure Isaacs out, like   there was something he was hiding.  Even

though Venice knew he was in his mid60s, he looked more like a tough guy than a stock

market expert.  He had broad shoulders, and a narrow waist, muscular.  His cheeks were

ruddy like he spent a lot of time outside in  the sun and the wind.  Damn genetics.  Some

people didnt have to work for anything and  had it all anyway.  He didnt look like a guy

who had just turned 40 and needed Viagra to  get it up anymore.  But Venice wasnt here

to feel sorry for himself.  He had a job to do.  And it was time to do it.

       Isaacs sat down in the brown reclining chair with a plop, in front of the big screen

TV, and he pointed to the couch.  Why  dont you sit down, he suggested, like a man

who meant it?
       Venice wasnt going to let himself be pushed around that way by some informant.

I think Ill stand.  Thisll just take a few minutes.

       So get started already!  Isaacs would be glad when this interview was over so

he could watch his football game.  You follow the Falcons at all?

       Im not really a football fan, said   Venice, although he split a pair of season

tickets with his brother-in-law, went to half the games.  He looked at the TV for a second,

trying to spot Bill in the cr owd.  Bill was married to his little sister, Leslie, he adored

Leslie.  Bill was a great guy, just the kind of  guy hed rather be spending the afternoon

with.  Then he thought he sounded like some  wuss for saying that, so he added, I think

the West Coast offense really ought to ope  n things up for Vick though.  They should

make the playoffs next year.

       Yeah, said Isaacs, passionately.  He l  oved football.  He didnt mind all the

damn questions now so much, not if this Venice character liked the Falcons.  So you

wanted to ask me about somebody, some Mary, Maury.

       Her name is Margaret Eastman, Venice   said.  His veins turned to ice at the

mention of her name.  Things like that shouldnt happen to a young woman like her.

       Who is she?  Issacs asked.

       Yeah! Who is she?  The door to the k itchen slammed open and in walked the

most beautiful woman Venice had seen today,  or maybe in a week.  The more he looked

at her, more he thought maybe in a lifetim   e, but he didnt have a whole lifetime of

experience yet.  But she was incredibly beau  tiful.  Her eyes burst with curiosity.  Or

maybe it was jealousy.  She was older, for a beautiful woman, maybe 40, maybe the exact

same age as Venice.  She was wearing a br a under her tight blouse and she was wearing
lipstick too, and he couldnt help staring at her.  Her hair was pretty too, like it was made

out of silk, just that kind of shiny.

       Hey Monica, we need some privacy to  discuss business, says Isaacs. Its just

man talk, nothing youd be interested in.

       If its another woman again, you bet Im     interested, she said, adjusting her

breasts to make them stick out more.  Venice  was still staring at her, he couldnt take his

eyes off her, and she was looking at his eyes , like she was touching herself for him, to be

prettier for him.  He couldnt believe it.

       I dont know who she is, Issacs said,  and he was regretting inviting Venice into

the house again.

       You sure you dont know anything about her? Venice asked.

       Monica stared at him with her lips ma king a little red pout.  If I knew anything

about her, you can bet Id let you know, she said, slapping Issacs on the top of his head.

       Ow! he said, grabbing the top of his head.

       He looked at Venice again and said I  said I dont know her or anything about

her.

       She was the nurse at the hospital where Bruce Lucent recovered from his

automobile accident, Venice said.  Shes really beautiful, like you wouldnt believe.

She has brown hair.

       I know you like women with brown hair  , you two-timing jerks, Monica said,

she was hitting Isaacs on the top of his head again, and he jumped up and yelled.

       Stop that, I said I dont know anything, and I dont know her!
       I could show you pictures, Venice said.   He had a lot of pictures of her, but he

didnt want to share all of them, not with this scum.  It might help your memory some.

       Listen, buddies, Isaacs said.  You came here, so you take what you get and

leave.  I said I dont know nothing, I dont know nothing, thats all there is to it.

       Why dont you take me? Monica purred at him.

       Hey now, I dont like that, Isaacs said, and now he was mad at all of them for

ruining his day.  He was mad enough to hur t somebody.  Hed killed a man before one

time, with his bare hands, and he could do it  again, if he put something in his bare hands

like a knife or a gun or something that he could kill somebody with.

       Venice sensed trouble ahead, but he wanted to see more of Monica.  He had the

sense though that they were just ships pa   ssing in the night, that she was just some

temporary liaison of Richard Isaacs, probably ju st another cheap tramp or something like

all the others.  Maybe she could be different, but it wasnt going to be in this lifetime, not

with him.

       Well, if you dont know anything, I guess Ill be going, he said.

       Walking down the sidewalk, the car waited for him at the curb.  He stopped

before opening the door and looked back up at the house.  He saw Isaacs standing in the

window frame looking back at him.  Some body was hiding something here, but Venice

knew he was a bulldog.  Hed get to the bottom of it yet.

       And it didnt matter who got hurt along the way, cause he was going to find out

the answers.
                                        

       Richard Isaacs stood gazing out the window  from the 32nd floor executive office,

Atlanta at his feet. The streets were empty  below but for a few pedestrians dashing for

cover beneath umbrellas. Timing was everything in this business. You couldnt make a

killing when people are dying. Especially if you hadnt planned for their death.  Business

thrived on stability and growth. And for that   stability, sometimes you had to play cut

throats.

       He heard the soft click as the door to the boardroom opened behind him.
       The mans broad shoulders and slim builds made his silhouette against the

window belie how close he was to retirement.  As if you would retire in the middle of the

biggest hand of your life, not when youre playing cut throats.

       He turned. The sunlight slanting in   through the window shimmered from the

obsidian tresses of Callie Archer. She glided into the room, perfect, as always. She may

have been wearing widows' black, but the swell  of her breast, the shift of her hip against

silk, assured him she wouldnt be alone for   long, not if he had anything to do with it.

Stability. All of them needed to be in Rich ard Isaacs pocket if he was going to keep this

ship on course.

       Archer Industries must thrive. Hed invested too much in what he knew about this

company, the way it operated and the under-the-t able trick's Henry Archer had used to

build it. All good products did not make a company great. Most of it was knowing how to

manipulate money and power and the markets, to find the loopholes in the laws, trade just

a little closer to the inside than many might feel comfortable doing. And when the players

get nervous, when they start worrying that their house of cards might fall, it was Richard

who knew just where to leak the word to  investigators to break up the game. And when

the dust settled, Isaacs always walked away unscathed with obscene amounts of cash in

his pocket and ever more power.  It was He nry Archer who had taught Richard the game

at which Richard excelled.

       Archer Industries had been poised to make the next great leap. Richard and Henry

planned to bring in Isaac Stevens, a heavy     if there ever was one in the corporate

battleground. But hed crossed Richard one too many times, the last when hed forced his

daughter Irene to end her relationship with Richard, right there, loudly, on the grounds of
the Polo Club before hundreds of Atlantas    most well-heeled citizens. Stevens would

give Isaacs the distance he needed when they started taking over their rivals, company by

company, and piecing them out, converting the stock options, doing the deals, raking in

the dough. And if someone must fall, all along   the plan had been to take Isaac down,

while Archer Industries subsidiaries conceal ed the deals. Richard and Henry were too

good at this game to fail. Theyd only miscalculate once in their 30-year partnership: they

hadnt expected Archer to drive off a cliff.

       Callie gave Isaacs a bare nod, a hint of a smile as she turned her back to him and

walked along the bookcases that lined one wa  ll. She ran her fingers along the spines,

letting them linger on the masters, books that  had never been cracked.  Of course, Henry

Archer was too important to be troubled with reading fiction, poetry, plays. But a wealthy

man who had built his company from nothi       ng needed a library, and he needed to

surround himself with art and the accouterment  s that demonstrated he was a thinking

man. But Henrys passions were the machin  ery of business, economics and industry.

Those were the well-thumbed books closest      to the desk. And his passions had been

serious as well. Invention, transportation, and keeping his wife content. The last mattered

most to Callie, of course. She would be well  cared for; her prenuptial agreement assured

her of that. But prestige that was something  a little harder to come by in this city. And

with a background like hers, prestige came from marrying well.

       At last, she settled in the seat behind that massive imposing desk from which

Henry Archer ran his world.
You wanted to see me? Callie asked him pointedly. One brow arched up, almost lost in

a lock of hair that had drifted lower on he r brow, like the question mark punctuating her

sentence.

I know this is a difficult time for you   Mrs. Archer, but you must understand, the

business of the company must move forward,  Richard said brusquely. He bent over the

desk toward her, his ruddy cheeks so close to hers she could see his pores. She leaned

back a little, then followed his gazes that ha d so briefly touched on her breast before it

moved to linger at her throat, in her hair, and at was pulled deep into her eyes.

       Henry and I spoke at length about the direction the company needs to take to be

competitive, Richard crooned as he gazed in to her eyes. This company was a passion

of his, you know, and I was about to help him double, triple its value. You need someone

in place to make those decisions now that Henry cant.

       Why, Mr. Isaacs, Im so pleased to hear your confidence in me, she said

demurely, though he could see a devil lurking  behind those eyes of hers; it kindled the

flames smoldering in her gaze. Of course  , I havent had much experience running a

company like Archer Industries. But, sure Henry would be pleased that it stayed in the

family.

       Richard leaned back. Was she playing him as he was trying to play her? What had

fired up that spark in her eye? Was she pla nning to take over the company? Did she have

the gall to do something like that? Witheffort  he pulled his gaze from hers and strode to

the window.

       Whats your game, Mrs. Archer? He       asked, staring over Atlanta, his voice

barely raising a little with a unconceal  ed anger. You know you dont have the
experience to run a company like this. Henry a nd I worked side by side for thirty years.

He pounded one fist into his open other palm  , in rhythm to his words. We built this

company together. I know what his plans were for growing the business, he said angrily.

       So you think you should be running it? Callie asked with that disarmingly

innocent gaze of hers, the one that seemed  to flash like the lightning playing across the

rooftops of Atlanta, moving swiftly from chimney to gable, until it reached its target with

a burst of heat and smoke. That was Callie Archers gaze.

       I wouldnt presume to, Mrs. Archer,  he enunciated somewhat crisply, turning

from the window to lay a gentle hand on her  shoulder. You are entitled as owner of the

company to sit at its head. But Henry had planned for some time to bring in Isaac Stevens

to coordinate some buyouts and sell-offs, all of it tricky and confusing and more than a

grieving wife should have to bear, he said  in a tone Callie thought might be paternal, or

condescending, or even genuinely caring. Di d Richard Isaacs even know how to grieve

for Henry Archer? She wasnt sure even she could grieve a man who treated his wife like

any of the other baubles hed collected to build his image.

       Richard read the hesitation in her eyes   and leaned in close, over her shoulder.

Let me guide you, Mrs. Archer. First, we     bring on Stevens, as planned. Once hes

installed, hell begin buying up Archer Industr ies competitors and dividing them up into

existing divisions, then sell them off, bit by bit, exercising options, and building this

company into the large cap company it ought to   be. He turned her in the chair so that

she faced him, the sunlight blinding on her dark waves of hair, the fire lit again in those

eyes of hers as her breasts rose in breaths that seemed to quicken beneath his gaze.
       Think of it Mrs. Archer, Callie, think   of it! he exclaimed. You can carry on

your life as you always have, leaving the tedious business dealings to me. But the power

will be yours. You will be Archer Industries.  Itll be your books that line the walls, your

charity events in the news, your parties the town will be talking about. Who knows, you

may even find love again.  I imagine a    woman of your uncommon beauty and means

would never need to be alone.

       Alone. As if Callie didnt already know  alone. Hadnt she survived ten years as

the bauble of Henry Archer? Callie Archer rose  from her chair, faced Richard squarely,

then turned on her heel. She again glided  through the room, touching a sculpture here, a

painting there, at last coming to the broa d mahogany doors out of her office. Her office.

She turned. Isaacs was again a black silhouette against a blazing sunset, fiery red, as if he

were some demon standing at the open gates to Hell. The entire board room had taken on

the devilish glow.

       She swept open the door.

       I imagine Ill be meeting Mr. Stevens before I have the opportunity to hire him?

she inquired.

       He swept toward her, his silhouette re solving into a well-built man only slightly

older than Henrys 60 years, his face quickly  fading from the silhouette of a dark demon

to a ruddy cheeked imp who looked like hed be at home on a soccer field.

       If thats your wish, he offered deferentially.

       It is, she said, catching her breath. Something about him made her heart pound,

as if she had agreed to work in a league with the devil himself.

       Its time for it to be about me, isnt it? She thought to herself.
       Then you will meet him, he said forcefully. We have an agreement, then,

youll accept my counsel? He thrust out his hand.

       She took it in both of hers and leaned to ward him, tilting her head to look him in

the eye, her breasts jostling within the black satin dress she wore. I look forward to  . . .

working with you.

       Again, she gave him that glinting glance,  an almost wicked smile playing across

her lips. What was her game?!
                                        

       Arthur Nance looked around the country   club parking lot, crowded with cars,

minivans, and SUVs old and new, battered and gleaming, cheap and priceless.  Squinting

into the late afternoon sun, the cars reflected   the red-tinged light off windshields and

bumpers and mirrors and doorknobs like a pack of  bicyclists caught in a searchlight late

at night on a deserted road.  "Well, Jason,"  he said impatiently, "do you recognize any of

them?"

       "No, Doctor Nance," answered his        nerdy young assistant with the pocket

protector and horn-rimmed glasses that he seemed to wear as a badge of honor.  "But I'm

not a big car guy, you know that, and I haven't got  all their cars in here yet anyway."  He

waved the sleek brushed-chrome Compaq iPac in  Arthur Nance's face, as if Arthur could

see that it was so light that he really couldn't have any cars in there yet.
       "Well, you'll have to work on that, because I really hate it when I have to leave a

place I wouldn't have gone into if I'd known   whose car was parked out front.  Okay?

Start on it tomorrow; has it done by the Miller's pool party on Saturday?"

       "Okay, Doctor Nance, will do.                Want me to go inside now?

       "Yeah, you do that, Jason."

       He wished he could smoke a cigarette while  he waited for Jason to return, but the

gravel-topped parking lot was just too public  a place for one of Atlanta's top doctors to

light up and hurt his image, which was of a trim, muscular, athletic medical genius who

played a mean game of a racket ball with a golf disability of two.  He'd just have to wait

until he got home, assuming he went home   alone, which he rather doubted because so

many women wanted him, what with his near-perfect body, huge mansion, and

astronomical salary, that he almost never went home alone unless he felt like it.

       Behind his back, stiletto heels clicked,   but not sharply and intensely like they

would on wood or marble, rather with a      little sogginess to them, a sort of muffled

slurping caused by their impacting asphalt that had gone soft and resilient in the hot

Atlanta sun.  He liked stiletto heels a lot, so he turned to see who was coming.

       It was Callie Archer, old Henry's widow  .  God, she was a looker, with those

glossy black tresses and fine, fines hooters.  She smiled and came toward him.  Even

though she was about forty, she still had an ass  to die for, although he was more of a leg

and foot man himself, which is why he preferred stiletto heels to pumps or running shoes.

"Hello, Arthur," she said saucily, laying a  perfectly manicured hand on his arm in a way

that promised interesting things to come, "is Jason inside making sure it's safe for you to

go in?"
       "Yes," he exclaimed, studying the smooth  white fingers tipped with crimson and

filed to glossy perfection.  "Y es, he is," he laughed, because it was a joke between them,

even though when you came right down to it, it didn't much amuse him when he wasn't

with Callie.

       Arthur Nance had a very poor memory for faces, especially women's faces,

because he almost never looked at their faces , especially if they were wearing open-toed

shoes with stiletto heels and had bright red  polish on their toenails, like Callie was.  He

had a fantastic memory for bare boobs and na     ked apses, of course, but those weren't

likely to be on display in the country club's   party room, at least not so early in the

evening.  In fact, the only reason he recogni  zed Callie was she'd been his patient for

going on twenty years, now, and after twenty  years, it's hard not to recognize somebody,

unless the light's bad or they've got a new haircut or something.

       So wherever he went, he took his assistant Jason with him, because Jason not only

had a photographic memory, he liked to look at women's faces, and besides, he had all

their pictures in his Palm Pilot anyway, just in case.

       Callie squeezed his forearm and leaned      so close to him that her big breasts

brushed his bicep.  "How many are you up too now, Artie?" she demanded.

       "Fourteen, I think, maybe fifteen.  And   don't call me Artie in public, okay?  It

diminishes the authority a doctor needs to do his job right."

       "But I can call you Artie when we're alone  together and I'm kneeling at your feet

and your pants are down around your ankles, can     't I?" her eyes flashed dangerously.

"Because if I can't, then maybe I'll have to   wash my hair on Friday night instead of on

Saturday morning, if you know what I mean."
       "Aw, shucks, Callie, sure you can call me  that  when we're somewhere nobody

can hear us, it's just, you know, when we're so mewhere with lots of people."  His voice

trailed off as he waved his free hand at the empty parking lot.

       "That's good, Artie."  She patted his hand.  "Shall we go in together?"

       "As soon as Jason oh, here he is."

       The nerdy young assistant stood before them , his eyes fixed on Callie's beautiful

cheekbones.  "Okay, Doctor Nance, it's safe.  There's not some singles woman in there

with a restraining order against you."

       "You're sure?" he inquired.  "Last Thursday, at the Gaieties"

       "Yeah, I feel bad about that," he said    sadly, "but who would have expected

Melissa Kriegel to be in a bedroom with somebody so early in the party?"

       "Melissa?" asked Callie indulgently.  "Was she with Walter?"

       "No," he said sardonically, "Dorothy."

       "Ah," she said and put more meaning in to that one single unbroken syllable than

an entire stack of a psychology textbook.  "Well, then, if the coast is clear, let's go in.

Are you coming, Jason?"

       He blushed at the question, and shook his   head form side to side.  "No, Doctor

Nance likes me to wait out front so that  if anybody on the list shows up, I can warn him

before they get within fifty feet of him."

       Arthur nodded.  Those fifty feet were impor tant.  He'd spent a whole night in a

county lockup once because he'd thought fifty, fo rty, what's the difference?  Ten feet, the

cops had told him belligerently, as they'd taken his belt and shoelaces and neckties and

fingerprints.  He tucked Callie's right hand under his left arm and led her inside.
       It was noisy, the kinds of noisy th  at only happening wh en you stuff a hundred

people into a room built for seventy-five, give  them all a couple of high-powered drinks,

and let the band crank its amps to max.  The air-conditioners were probably raising a

ruckus, too, but who could hear them over the roar of the crowd?

       From the far side of the room, Isaac Stevens raised a hand to Arthur and picked

his way through the press of humanity to  him, pulling a beautiful young woman along

with him by the hand.  "Arthur," he said softly, "just the man I've been looking for."  He

crossed the last ten feet and thrust out his hand.  "Hello, Callie."

       "Hello, Isaac," she responded sedately, but her grip tightened on Arthur's forearm.

       "Arthur," he said, taking a pull on his drink, and his speech was a little slurred, so

it was as clear the vodka in his glass that this  wasn't his first drink of the night, or even

his fifth, for that matter, "you know my daughter Irene, don't you?"

       "Yes, of course," he said at once, inwa rdly glad that Isaac had told her who she

was because he really hadn't recognized her, not in this setting or that skin-tight emerald

cocktail gown cut so low that it made a man  want to punch his fist at the sky and shout

"Wee-hah!"  After all, the last time he'd seen she was in a dimly-lit restaurant on Peach

Street, sitting in a booth at the back with Henr  y Archer so close that it was hard to tell

where one began and the other left off, he r right hand under the table but apparently in

Henry's lap, from the contented yet anticipatory gleam in old Henry's good eye.

       "And Callie," said Isaac, his expression simmering, "I do believe I haven't seen

you since the funeral.  You're looking l    ovely tonight, my dear, as you always do,

whatever the circumstances.  May I presen     t my daughter Irene?  Irene, this is Mrs.

Archer, whose husband Henry died recently."
       Callie extended her hand to the blonde young thing and murmured, "It's a pleasure

to make your acquaintance."

       Irene took a deep breath, some breaths th at made her large breasts look as though

an anti-gravity beam had just rippled thr  ough them, and then took Callie's hand.  "It's

very nice to meet you, Mrs. Archer.  I'm sorry to hear about your husband."

       "Why, that's very kind of you," she riposted.

       Watching all this, Arthur Nance quirked an eyebrow, but so inconspicuously that

no one but he could see.  Very interesting, he thought to himself.  Old Henry's widow and

old Henry's bereaved mistress, pretending   not to know each other, when to Arthur's

certain knowledge, the two had, on more than one occasion, shared the same bed in order

to pleasure the old man and make sure he   never developed eyes for anyone else.  Yes,

very interesting, he thought to himself.  I wonder what's raising?  Besides that, I mean, as

he subtly adjusted his trousers.
                                        

       As Yvonne Perrin climbed the stairs to  Rory Edward's penthouse, she could not

shake the ominous feeling of dreadful fear that dampened her day.  It was a beautiful day

in Atlanta, Georgia, fair too partly cloudy,  with temperatures in the low 80s, dropping to

60 around midnight, it was the type of day Yvonne  usually found to make her feel like a

child again.  But it was not to be that way today, as cruel fate would have it.

       Rory's penthouse was on Peachtree Street       in Atlanta, Georgia.  Rory often

wondered how he would afford it, secretly afraid that his job might be not as secure as he

was led to believe.  Just the other day, Mr  . Ricketts, his boss, had called him on the

carpet and read him the riot act over the problem with the Zimmerman telegram. This

made him feel bad. But Rory never told   anyone this, so Yvonne had not known of his

fears.  But he appreciated her visits , and today Yvonne was bringing him a box of
doughnuts wrapped in bright red plastic wraps that reminded her of the day she boiled the

eggs, even though she knew Rory wouldnt be there to appreciate it.

       Rory's door was open when Yvonne Perrin got  to the top of the stairs that were

unusual. It was a large wooden door, usually painted white, that Rory bought at an estate

sale in Milledgeville, Georgia, the capital of the state before the Civil War and General

William Tecumseh Sherman's famous marc  h through Georgia during the Civil War

burned the city to the ground, both cities, actually, It (the door) had three hinges and a

doorknob, as well as a doorknocker in the shape of a horseshoe that didn't work.  It was a

real find and Rory often regretted the fact  he had never gotten it properly appraised by a

licensed appraiser.  It was one of Rory's  biggest regrets, eating at him like a monster

devouring his soul and spitting out the remnants  of his shoes in little bits of leather and

oil.

       Yvonne went inside Rory Edward's pent  house.  It was decorated with yellow

walls, with an 8-x 10 color glossy photos of  Rory's pet dog Barky on one of the walls.

The dog was a champion show dog, winners of   many gold medals, but had to be put

down after. Rory had never gotten over it,   sobbing uncontrollably whenever he ate at

Burgher King. The picture window faced East , overlooking the river, a thin blue ribbon

in the distance.  Yvonne and Rory love to   hold their hands and watch the sun setting,

especially in winter, when the average hi gh temperature was only 53 degrees. There was

a smell in the air that Yvonne couldn't identify.

       Callie Archer suddenly entered.  She     was wearing only a bathrobe!  Naked

underneath! Yvonne was shocked and startled!  What was Callie doing there?!

       Callie was wondering the same thing!
       "What are you doing here?" she demanded.

       Callie didn't know what was going on.  "I  had not expected you today, Yvonne,"

she commented cattily.

       "Never mind that!" Yvonne exclaimed.  "Where is your husband, Bruce?"

       "Well, you know," Callie cried hesitantl y, her long glossy black hair hanging in

front of her face.  She hated when that happened and slid it aside.

       Yvonne was confused.  This was impossible!  "Would you like some donuts?" she

offered, holding the bag.

       "Do you have any chocolate?" Callie asked.

       "I think they were out," stated Yvonne  bitterly, opening the box.  There were a

dozen -- three jelly, four glazed, two strawb   erries frosted, three peanut butter, and

Yvonne's favorite, a coconut glazed.  "Would you like a cream filled?"

       Callie pounded the table.  "Damn!" she  cursed.  "Why does everything happen to

me!" she exclaimed.  She dropped her robe on      the floor.  "I never get a break!" she

hissed.

       Yvonne felt really badly!  She had know n Callie for years, since the summer of

'91 when a cloud the shape of a ball of dus  t opened the sky to the heavens and turned

their life into one big fun time.  It was late in the evening and Callie was wearing a bright

green skirt and matching red top with pink lace  at the neck and sleeves.  It had a slight

paisley pattern that caught the sun.  It wa  s before Bruce's accident.  Though he would

never say so, Rory Edwards thought she was   the most beautiful woman he'd seen.  He

often wished that Callie wasn't married, or that Bruce was dead or something!

       The night was magical, and the band played disco into the night.
       "Are you doing something with Rory?" she asked, deciding to take the bull by the

horns and get to the root of the situation and let the chips fall as they may.

       "I refuse to answer that," Callie said pigheadedly.  "I don't have to answer that!"

       This was a fine how-de-do!  "After a ll we've done together, you-all won't tell me

what you're doing!" she cried loudly.

       "O, for crying out loud, Yvonne!" Callie    shouted back like a bellowing mule,

"What do you think? What does it look like?"

       "Is Rory here?" Yvonne sobbed.

       "He left."  Callie informed her.  She we nt to the refrigerator and opened a can of

Diet Pepsi.  "He . . . he couldn't perform."

       "Yes," agreed Yvonne.  "He often has that problem."

       "What!  You, too!"  Callie blurted. This  was a big surprise!  What in the world

was Callie thinking?!

       Rory was always afraid this could happe n.  Despite his macho exterior, he was a

bundle of fears inside, an writhing masse     s of phobias that made him tremble in

nervousness.  If he knew what the two girl  s were saying about him right now, his ears

would probably burn red hot!  Or hotter!

       Callie sat on the red leather couch that Rory  had picked up on sale in Sears at the

Peachtree Mall.  She suddenly felt like a fool !  How could she not have guessed?  The

signs were all there, the skim milk instead of 2%, the sudden change in Rory's manor, the

time he spent "working" at the office.

       "Pepsi?" offered Yvonne, sensing her pain  and offering her can.  She had had her

share of bad love affairs, like that hands ome doctor with the office on Peachtree Street
who dumped her when she had hinted that sh  e wanted more from the relationship than

donuts.  Suddenly, the box of doughnuts depressed   her.  She wanted to drown in their

rich, creamy taste, become for gotten in their sweet crunch that reminded her of the death

of Arky. It was even worse with the weightlifter.

       Callie took the peace offering gratefully.   "I'm not a bad person," she pointed out,

drawing her robe around her.  "I'm just cursed."

       Suddenly, there was someone at the door!  Callie could tell by the sound of the

corduroys that it was her husband, Bruce!  What a predicament!  If Bruce found out about

this, its being all over!

       "What should we do?" fretted Callie, her  eyes beseeching her longtime friend.  It

was a scary situation!  Callie didn't want Br uce to know, but after the accident, he had

become different.  "Yvonne, but I need your help!" she begged.

       Yvonne felt sorry for her friend Callie, who had such beautiful glossy black hair.

       "Rory," called Bruce, lisping slightly.  "Have you seen my hard drive?  I'm a

software developer, you know."

       "We need to do something!" Callie whispered.  "Bruce doesn't know about Rory!"

       It was scary!  If Bruce found out, there  was no telling what he might do! He was

insanely jealous, given to furious rages at the drop of a hat!

       "What should we do?" Callie asked?  We need to do something!

       Yvonne thought about it.  The needed to do something!  But what could they do?

Bruce hadn't been the same since the accident .  It was all so hopeless!  Yvonne should

have known better than to bring the donuts; Bruce was sure to blame her!

       Suddenly, she had an idea!
       "Go into the bedroom!" she urged Callie.  "I have an idea!"

       "An idea?" asked Callie.  She had ideas   of her own, dreams of beautiful winter

knights in Tallahassee, Georgia, watching the    ships come in from the sea.  With a

handsome man by her side, his strong many arms mannishly comforting her with his

male strength.  She dreamed that idea many nights, but when she woke up, the arms were

gone and she was in a stone cold bed with no   joy except for her tropical fish.  Dead all

these many years.

       "I should go into the bedroom," Callie opined.  She picked the robe up off the

floor and did so.

       "This had better work," Yvonne muttered as she opened the door that could mean

a matter of life or death!
                                        

       Atlanta was a hot city that day, and the  air conditioner was dribbling and leaving

a pool on the floor.  Too bad it wasnt helping to keep the station house cool.  I hate

summer in Atlanta, Andrew Venice thought.  Hed give anything to be hanging around

up north some where--anywhere so long as it  wasnt 90 degrees in the shade and full of

concrete.

       He had half way convinced himself to go down to the cantina and get a cold tall

one when someone shouted at him.

       Hey Andy, you got a visitor!

       Andrew raised his bleary eyes from the mass of papers on his desk.  It had been a

long day, and in spite of all his efforts to dig up everything he could on this case, he was

still no closer to figuring out who has killed  Henry Archer than he had been when they
found Archer dead.  The scattering of evidence wasnt producing any clues that he could

use.  Suffice to say, he was not a happy camper just now and it was playing Old Harry

with his temper.  The last thing he wanted  was a visitor.  Probably some wino coming in

to report seeing pink elephants in the alleyways of Atlanta.  The city was full of crazy

drunks, and most of them ended up at the police station at one time or another.

       Of course, being a detective, Andrew didnt usually have to put up with them.

The desk officer at the door was usually   the one who was inundated with drunks and

floosies and every other whacko in the street.

       Im just the murder guy...

       Who is it, Sergeant? Andrew growled.   He hated interruptions, especially when

he had not had enough sleep.  Hed been up all night staring at the photos of Archers

body.  It had been too hot to go to sleep last  night.  Even sleeping in his underwear had

not been comfortable.  He would have stripped naked, but old lady Carson in the flat

across the way was already on her last pace maker.  No use in giving the old girl a kick-

off before her time, though she would have gone with a smile on her prune face.

       The Sergeant merely stepped aside, pulling his police hat off his head and holding

it in both hands.  His cheeks had a sort of a  pple glow.  He turned his eyes to look just

down the hall, and he smiled.

       Well? Andrew barked.

       A woman with a head full of hair as re    d as a roaring fire stepped through the

doorway.  She had green eyes like the rich emeralds in a princess crown and they settled

on Andrew the way a fox looks at a chicken  thats strayed from the hen house.  Hungry

but hesitant, and wary in case there was  a dog nearby.  He puffed his chest and stood up,
enjoying the way her eyes rode up and       down his well-built frame.  Clearly, she

appreciated how well set-up he was.  In    turn, he stared unabashed at her voluptuous

figure clad in a short tight black leather sk  irt and pink frilly blouse open nearly to the

navel.  He put her about thirty-five, though she might have been able to pass for younger.

       Hi there, she said in her thick Southe rn drawl.  Are you Andrew Venice? she

asked.

       I might be, Andrew said.  Whos asking?

       She sauntered into the room, walked over  to the chair before his desk and seated

herself demurely without even being asked.   The angle gave Andrew a better look at her

cleavage.  He was starting to feel warm.

       My name is Yvonne Perrin, and Im a friend of Callie Archer, she said.

       Callie Archer?  Henry Archers wife?    Andrew dropped into his chair and

started pushing papers aside in search of the report of Callie Archer.

       Widow, actually.  Yvonne smiled, and A ndrew knew then that she was too hot

of a woman to be handling in the summer.   Those green eyes were starting to mesmerize

him.  He cleared his throat roughly.

       So...what can I do for you? Venice said, trying to keep his mind on his work.

       Well, you see, I heard on the TV that the police were asking that if anyone knew

anything about the Archer case to please co me forward.  She pushed a hand through her

thick red tresses, brushing them out of   her green eyes.  So I thought I should come

forward and tell you what I know.

       And just what do you know? Andrew asked.
       For a moment, Yvonne glanced over her shoul der.  Then she looked back at him

and leaned so she was braced on the far side of his desk.

       Im not the sort of girl who rats on her friends, mind you.  Callie and I go back a

few years.  Shes always been like a big sister to me, if you know what I mean.

       Yeah, I know, Archer said.

       And youll probably think Im terrible for  telling you this.  She looked at her

hands.

       I make that decision after you tell me, Archer said.

       Yvonne pursed her luscious lips.  Well, as I said, Callie and I go back a ways...to

when she was Callie Lucent.  Before she married Henry.  She tells me everything...well,

almost everything.  Anyway, I knew her olde     r brother Bruce too.  Hes over at the

hospital right now recovering from an automobile accident.  I though I would drop in and

visit him...just to make him feel better.  Callie  said he was sorta blue.  But he was asleep

when I got there, and I didnt want to wake him up, but I didnt know what to do.

       I was going to leave when I decided to  use that little bathroom in his room, and

while I was in there, I heard people coming into the room.  I was going to call out and let

them know I was in there, but I heard Callie...and I heard Dr. Nance.

       Dr. Nance? Andrew asked.

       Arthur Nance.  Yvonne waived her  hand around in the air as though shoeing

flies.  Hes some big time doctor over ther  e.  Anyway, I heard Callie say, Is he still

asleep, and Dr. Nance said, Oh, yeah, hes going to be out for a while...

       She paused.

       And? Andrew insisted.
       It got quiet, and I opened the door...and Callie was kissing Dr. Nance like he was

an old flame.

       Andrew frowned.  So what did you do?

       Well, I didnt want them to know I was in there, and that I heard them and saw

them, so I sorta slipped out of the room and left.  She cocked her head like a little girl

afraid of being scolded.  Was that wrong of me?  I just didnt want to embarrass them...

       Just like that? Andrew asked.  They didnt see you leave?

       Yvonne shook her head so the cascades of   red hair shimmered like flames in a

fireplace.  God, he wished it was winter...

       I was real quiet, she said.  Anyway, thats what I know.  Its what I saw.

       And just why are you telling me this now?

       Because...it was back before Henry di ed...and it made me wonder if he knew

Callie might actually be having an affair w ith the doctor who was looking after her older

brother.

       Andrew sighed.  Well, I want to thank you for coming in and telling me this, he

said as he stood up.

       Yvonne pulled herself out of the chair and nodded.

       Thanks for letting me tell you, she said.   Its a load off my mind, and can sure

tell you.

       If you think of anything else, Andrew said.  Give me a call.

       I will, she said and smiled.  Bye, now.
       She sauntered back out of the office just as Sergeant was returning.  Sergeant

pulled off his hat again and nodded to her as she passed.  Then he took his hat and started

to fan himself while smiling at Andrew.

       Now thats what I call one hot little lady, the Sergeant said.  I wish I was a few

years younger, I do.  Are you gonna ask her out?

       Dont be ridiculous, Andrew snarled a nd motioned the Sergeant to leave.  Still

grinning like a hyena, the Sergeant wandered aw ay.  Then Andrew sat down and started

staring at his papers.

       So Arthur Nance and Callie Archer have a past, Andrew muttered.

       That was something to ponder.
                                        

       Irene Stevens nibbled at her sautéed crab cake (it was nestled in a mild golden

curry sauce and garnished with micro basil) , and gazed at Bruce Lucent, who was sitting

at the head of the 42-seat table with his  wife, that positively ancient Callie Archer with

her glossy raven hair (that had to be Miss   Clairol or Irene wasn't the reigning Georgia

Peach Princess for 2003!) and her gravity-defying 38DD boobs. Bruce (who had the

studliest body ever, but a face like a turn ip, round and a little purple around the bottom

where his skin was still recovering from the laser peel to get rid of those nasty acne scars)

was in a midst of a long, boring presenta     tion about his newest software package,

LuceLips, an interactive speech-recognition pr ogram that could do everything from read

you're morning newspaper to you to book you're lunch reservation.
       At this point in the long presentation (too too long, as far as Irene was concerned),

chef Joel himself clapped his hand to  his mouth in amazement. "You mean a  computer

reserved my special Cellar Room for this   function?" the handsome and dashing chef

gasped, smiling broadly, and everyone set down their salad forks and applauded with

appropriate little oohs and ahhs and titters of  appreciation. It was enough to make a girl

gag.

       "How's the crab cake?" Rory Edwards asked.

       Rory Edwards, sixty (but he didn't look  a day over forty, not with that absolute

hard body!), was Irene's bestand at the moment onlyfriend in the whole sunny state

of Georgia. She just didn't understand why other girls didn't like her. All the men she met

did.

       In answer, Irene popped a bite of the crab cake into her mouth and gave a little

shivering moan of ecstasy. That little shiv er made her ample bosom quiver on an even

larger scale, causing the computer geek across from her to nearly poke himself in the

cheek with his fork. Now there was a man  who could stand some buzzing with a laser!

That unibrow simply had to go, and that tattoo,  UNIX Rulz! was just too icky for words.

Especially on his neck. Imagine having to look at that every single day of you're life!

       "It's delish," Irene simpered. "Thanks so much for bringing me, Roar."

       Rory Edwards's tanned cheeks turned pink  in response to her use of her pet name

for him, "Roar," and he took off his spectacles and polished them feverishly, something

he always did, Irene noticed archly, whenever she paid him a compliment. He looked

pretty darn good for sixty, thought Irene. She' d always thought golf  was an even bigger

bore than computers, but Rory Edwards was living proof positive the sport had
something going for it. Either that or Rory   was sinking his considerable fortune into

liposuction and face-lifts.

       Bruce Lucent aimed the laser pointer he was holding at the giant screen and said,

"Next slide, please," in his slightly boyish   (but not in a bad   kind of way) voice, but

instead of the silver and black Lucent banner, an error screen popped up.

       At the same moment, a woman's sultry       voice issued from the speakers, "Oh,

Bruce, darling, I'm afraid something's gone terribly wrong."

       The raven-haired beauty sitting beside Bruce made a wide-eyed moue of

astonishment and shook her magnificent mane of  raven hair. "Why, Bruce, darling . . . !"

she cried, smiling widely, her teeth like snowy Chickens and her lips like glossy red satin

pillows, and pointed to the computer to make  sure even the dumbest of the dumb got the

joke. "That's my voice!"

Irene stifled the urge to roll her eyes and  stick her finger down her throat and pantomime

a person throwing up. Oh, as if . . . ! She thought. Could any of this be any more fake?

       Bruce cleared his throat and frowned in  mock displeasure. He tipped his head on

one side, stroking his rugged chin with his   long fingers, fingers that looked as if they

really knew how to pleasure a woman, Irene  thought dreamily. She squirmed a little in

her chair, entertaining racy fantasies about what she'd like to do with a studly body like

Bruce Lucent's. Bruce opened his voice to give a command, but before Bruce could speak

the computer voice that was exactly the same as Callie Lucent's voice asked in a husky

drawl that sounded like she'd been positively  gargling straight tequila, "What can I do to
make it up to you?" It sounded, Irene thought with  uncharacteristic lack of charity, as if

Callie Lucent's computer voice was asking if Bruce wanted a blow job.

       Stabbing ferociously at her crab cake,    Irene pretended for a moment that the

golden-sauced crustacean cake was Callie's face.  Her oh-so-perfect Baptist face, clear of

wrinkles, clear of unsightly hairs, clear of   pimples. The arrogant woman. Irene's hand

crept to her chin to surreptitiously fondle the hard red zit that was swelling under her

creamy skin. It was the kind of zit that  hovered under the surface for days, not really

showing but feeling, if you touched it, which Irene did  about a zillion times a day, to see

whether it was forming a head or not. Sometimes Irene hated being a mere twenty-two,

even if it did mean she could go braless without worrying she'd look like she was

carrying two droopy water balloons under her trendy Donna Karan tank top. She had

firm, upright breasts, the left just a teensy-  tiny big bigger than the first, something her

doctor told her not to worry about. It just made them more kissable, he'd assured her as

he pleasured her atop the examining table,    her feet in the stirrups, his hand over her

mouth to stop her unstoppable little cries of ecstasy.

       Irene's nostrils flared with delicate disdain as she glared at Callie Archer's ample

bosom. There was more silicon floating in that woman's chest than there was in the

laptop computer Bruce Lucent was showing off  this very minute to the two men at the

table. Irene wondered momentarily who they   were, and if they were as well-to-do as

Bruce. One of them (Irene could tell she was a computer geek from the fact he was

wearing a Star Trek T-shirt under his sports jacket, a jacket so old and tatty it had shiny

elbows, and blue jeans from Gap. There wa s even a plastic strip running down the leg

that said "38-38-38-38" all the way down to  his calf) was engrossed in whatever was on
the screen. The other, a young redheaded man with ginger freckles and a studly body but

a really ugly face and the worst teeth Irene had ever seen on a man, was ogling the five or

six acres of cleavage Callie Lucent was displaying. Irene sniffed. That any woman over

forty would dare wear a Betsey Johnson, especially in a high-end upper-class place like

Joel's, positively reeking of good taste, was just unthinkable. All she needed to complete

the ensemble, Irene thought with uncharacteristic  sarcasm, was a pair of castanets and a

guitar player shouting "Ole!"

       That made her smile, and she dabbed her   glossy lips delicately with her napkin

(good thing she'd remembered to use her new Clinique "Stay the Day" lipstick!) before

once more putting her attention back on her   crab cake. Swirling a forkful in the mild

golden curry sauce, she took a bite. It really   was scrumptious, but if she ate the whole

thing, and the pôt de chocolat served with crème fraiche sorbet and a rolled sugar wafer

cookie she'd been eyeing on the menu (or maybe the delicious-sounding   crème caramel

with honey-vanilla ice cream and a sweet almond wafer cookiethey both sounded    so

good!), and a couple more glasses of this positively yummy 1999 Marsannay   rosé from

Domaine B. Clair in Burgundy, France, she'd either have to skip dinner tonight or march

right into the washroom and throw it up.

       Suddenly, just like he was right there across the table from her, his laugh lines

deep as the Grand Canyon and his merry eyes  twinkling like stars, Irene could hear her

dearly-departed and oh-so deeply missed d ead lover Henry Archer's gruff down-home

rumble: If'n ya'll are gonna just upchuck it the  second y'all finish eatin' it, Reeny-bean,

what's the gol-dang point of spendin' this kind of cash on lunch?
       Her china-blue eyes welled with tears.  Oh, Daddy Hank . . . !  she thought. (He

wasn't really like her real daddy, but since he'd been so much older than she was and took

care of her better than her real daddy ever did, never hitting herexcept when they

played "Spanky Pants"and never forcing her to do anything she didn't honestly truly

want toexcept when they played "Rape Me  Till I Squeal!" or maybe sometimes when

they played "Good Till the Last Drop," which r eally wasn't her favorite game, to tell the

honest truthand never, ever calling her horrible cruel names like "Daddy's Little Blow-

Up Dolly.")  How could you leave me like that,    my sweet Daddy Hank, without even

saying goodbye to you're darling Reeny-Bean?  It had been six months, but not a day

went by that she didn't miss her darling "daddy."  It was, in fact, why she was sitting here

in swanky Joel's restaurant: today was their first anniversary.

       Well, it would have been their first anniversary, that is, if Henry Archer hadn't

been so tragically killed in that tragic car  accident out on the Parkway. Could it really be

six months since he'd been killed so tragi cally? It seemed like only yesterday they were

snuggling on his big round king-size bed or ki  ssing in his kidney-shaped pool or just

holding hands like a pair of giddy freshmen away at college.

       That was Daddy Hank had still been marri     ed to that positively vulpine Callie

Archer then"vulpine" was Irene's "New Word of the Day," one of the many self-

improvement things Irene was doing to improve  herself so she could rise up above the

red-dirt-poor country-style life she'd grown up inbut she obviously wasn't satisfying

him, not like a  real woman could.  Not like I could , thought Irene, tossing her glorious

mane of flaxen hair in vexation. There wa  s no one in the world she hated more than
Callie Archer, who used to be married to  Daddy Hank before he met Irene and found out

what true love really was. Daddy Hank had promised  to leave his wife for Irenehe'd

even started the divorce proceedingsbut then he 'd died so tragically in that tragic car

accident, before he could change his will, before he could divorce Callie, before he could

marry his beloved Reeny-Bean and make an honest woman out of her.

       And then, to add insults to injury, to make matters worseas if they could ever

get any worse!the straw that broke the   camel's back was when Callie turned around

and married Bruce Lucent just a week, a  week! after poor Daddy Hank died. Callie

inherited everything, and Irene was left practically penniless. Callie even cancelled the

lease on that cute little Lexus coupe Daddy Hank had given Irene, the merciless,

heartless, cruel witch. It was enough to make  Daddy Hank turn over in his graveif he

had a grave, that was, but he didn't, being  cremated, after all, since Callie was too cheap

to buy a plot and casket and cement liner.    She'd had him stuffed into the cheapest

cardboard box the funeral home had, and then  mailed the box to Irene. Postage due. The

arrogant woman.

       If only there was a way I could make     her pay, Irene thought, fiercely fighting

back the tears that welled to her lovely ch  ina-blue eyes. If only there was something, I

could take away from her . . . !

       Bruce Lucent was finished his part of the presentation, nodding and smiling at the

applause. As his technical assistant took   over explaining the technical parts of the

software, Bruce put his hand on Callie's s houlder and murmured, "Back in a sec, hon."

Then he headed out of the 42-seat private Chef's Room, which was just off the kitchen. It
had beautiful art, high ceilings, and state-of-t he-art technology available to rent, which is

probably why Bruce Lucent chose it for his software presentation.

       And suddenlylike she'd been struck  by lightninga light  bulb went off over

Irene's pretty head. Once more patting her glossy lips (and tucking her Clinique "Stay the

Day!" lipstick in the pocket of the chic  little Versace number she'd carefully picked out

that morning, knowing it accentuated her vol uptuous perfect size-6 body), Irene slid out

of her chair and leaned close to Rory to  confide, "Just going to powder my nose, Roar.

Order me the  pôt de chocolat served with  crème fraiche sorbet and a rolled sugar wafer

cookie, will you?"

       She had a feeling she'd be hungry when she got back.

                                          * * *

       Steven Suffern eyed the voluptuous young bl onde as she left the room, her round

ass looking like a juicy Georgia peach in that sexy little number she was wearing. Steven,

a masseuse at Atlanta's Polo Club, had an eye  for the ladies, but he liked to bat for both

teams. In fact, he had his eye on the studly older guy she'd been sitting withSteven had

asked around and found out quite a bit about   Rory Edwards, who was sixty but didn't

look a day over forty. One was that the hard  body was just as good without the clothes

no corset for Mr. Edwards!and the other wa      s that Rory Edwards was loaded, rich,

rolling in the dough. And unattached.

       The "unattached" part was the one Steven was hoping to personally change, and

hopefully by this afternoon, suppertime maybe, or this evening at the latest. He'd scored a
ticket to the $200-a-plate luncheon presentation by giving an extra-special massage to fat

old Mrs. Decatur. He'd never be able to watch the movie      Deliverance again without

thinking fondly on the moment. He'd known there would be dozens of fat, rich pigeons at

a do like this; no reason he couldn't pluck   one. And Mr. Rory Edwards was the perfect

pigeon. Steven had seen the way his eyes       , a lovely chocolate-brown behind his

spectacles, had kept roving his way. He might have a chubby for the luscious blonde, but

put a bat in his hands, and he'd nail one out of the park.

       Steven rose, unconsciously checking his ha ndsome visage in the mirror for errant

flecks of micro basil (he'd had the crab cak es) and made his way over to Rory Edwards.

"Mind if I sit down and chat for a moment?" he asked, his pleasant baritone warm and

inviting. He put out his hand and offered a  manly squeeze, which Rory Edwards returned

withequal fervor.

       "Uh, er, my companion will return shortly . . .  Edwards stammered.

       Steven slid his hand under the table, expe rtly flicking the snowy linen tablecloth

over Edwards's lap to cover the fact that hi s nimble fingers were even now sliding down

the zipper of Edwards's expensive Ralph Laur en stain-repellant slacks. "Don't sweat it,

handsome," he murmured with a throaty gr owl that made perspiration beads pop out on

Edwards's surprised face. "This won't take long . . . 

                                          * * *

       Irene smoothed the skirt of her natty little Versace number over her curvy hips,

smiling a secret smile to herself as she re-e  ntered the 42-seat private dining room. She

was a little out of breath, and if truths are told, her "Stay the Day!" lipstick hadn't quite

held up to it's advertised promise of lasting through everything, but otherwise, no one
would guess that she'd just moments before  been riding Bruce Lucent like a champion

bucking-bronc rider at a Texas rodeo, his face buried between her firm, high breasts that

bounce unfettered and free.

       There was a young man sitting in Irene's seat, but he jumped to his feet the

moment he saw Irene, giving her a smile that  showed off his perfect white teeth. He had

the most startlingly green eyes, like a cat's, an  emerald color that showed off his golden

tan and sculpted features. Irene's own China-blue eyes strayed down to his crotch, noting

withexpert quickness that he dressed le ft and was hung like a stallion. She licked her

lips, smiling as she lifted her hungry eyes off  his crotch. Surely she'd worked off enough

calories with Bruce that she could have her two desserts, after all.

       "You'd never guess what I've been doing,  Roar," Irene confided, sure the young

man couldn't hear her (not realizing that   he could indeed, and was hanging on every

word). "I've just given Bruce Lucent the ride of his life!"

       Irene laughed merrily, her laugh like a do zen little tinkling bells, and tossed her

magnificent mane of flaxen hair. "I followed him into the men's room," she said in a

purring voice. "Caught he with his pants down, so to speak!"

       Rory Edwards just blinked at her, his mouth open a little. Irene laughed again,

gaily, enjoying the effect she was having. This  would certainly get him in the mood for

what she had planned later this afternoon!

       "I pretended I didn't know I was in the men's and got all flustered and excited,"

Irene said. "So excited, my breasts just  popped out of the top of my Versace! These darn

criss-cross tops just don't hold  anything in! And as soon as he saw my bobbiesthat's

what Daddy Hank liked to call themwell, Roar, he just about popped, too!"
       Irene's pretty face was flushed as she ex  citedly recounted the tale of what had

happened in the men's room: "I said to him,  'Ooo, Mr. President, I've always wanted to

try one of those big cigars .  . . ! Can I have just a teensy little taste?' Roar, I thought his

eyes were going to fall right out of his head  he was staring so hard, and he couldn't say a

word, just kept making these funny little noise s like a puppy on his mama's teat, so I just

went to my knees and went to work."

       Rory Edwards groped in his pocket for his handkerchief and mopped his sweating

face. It was a rather violent red, Irene no ticed, but she was having too much fun telling

her story to bother asking if he was feeling all right.

       "He pulled me to my feet," Irene said,      her China-blue eyes sparkling at the

memory of how manly Bruce had been, "and he picked me up and set me on the imported

Italian marble counter top, and pulled my panties down with his teeth! And oh, Roar, he

pleasured me with his probing tongue and nimble  fingers . . . ! Just when I thought I had

reached the utmost peak of bliss, he thrust his throbbing member deep inside my hot little

juicy love-box, and pounded me like a snorting stallion on a broody marewell, except

that a stallion would have had her doggy-style, or horsey-style, I guess you'd have to say,

taking her roughly and manfully from behi nd, but Bruce mounted me from the front

until I shrieked so loudly and with such unsurpassed abandon that he had to put his hand

over my mouth to stifle my cries of ecstasy as he filled me with his steaming love-juices!

Oh, Roar . . . ! I've never felt such bliss, such ecstasy, such rapture, such elation, such"

       Irene stopped, suddenly aware that Rory  Edwards' eyes had stopped blinking. His

hand clutching his handkerchief had fallen to  his lap, pushing aside the tablecloth that

had, until that fateful moment, been covering the fact that his fly was down and his rather
large and still a tumescent member was fully exposed and his Ralph Laurens' stain-free

slacks hadn't lived up to their reputation.

       Rory Edwards, in fact, had stopped together . His heart, at least. Strained to it's

very limit's from Steven Suffern's expert  ministrations, it had been pushed beyond the

very limit's of human endurance by listening to  Irene's spirited and passionate exposition

of her washroom conquest of software developer Bruce Lucent.

       Irene's lovely China-blue eyes filled with  horror and flew to Steven Suffern, who

was standing stock-still and frozen with u  tter shock behind them. Then she began to

scream, loud and long, even louder than she' d shrieked while being pleasured by Bruce

Lucent. But this time, no one moved to put   his hand over her glossy lips and stop her

anguished cries. Like an ululating sire n, klaxoning on and on and on and on and on, she

kept it up for a full twenty-three piercing mi  nutes until the police arrived and a craggy

officer finally slapped her to shut her the hell up.
                                        

       The doorbell rang and Irene looked up from   the magazine article she had been

reading over and over again for the last half  -an-hour. She would not have been able to

tell anyone, not even her best friend Abbey O' Neil, what the article was about. Oh, she

could have guessed of course, and said the  article was about women's fashion, the latest

rage in New York, jodhpurs or henna hand        tattoos, but she would have just been

guessing. The article was just chicken scratch that her usually well-tuned mind could not

comprehend. Her thoughts were of nothing at     all, nothing but the death of her lover

Henry Archer.

       Never again would their bodies glide together in union. Never again would she be

able to run her fingers along his ample      muscles. Never again would he kiss her

voluptuous breasts or caress her beautiful blonde hair. Death was the cruelest break-up of

all.

       The doorbell rang again and Irene came back  from her thoughts of Henry. It was

all she had left of Henry. That and the apartment. The mink was also hers. He had been
giving to her, and she to him where she c ould. Very giving. But then Henry had been so

handsome. Her best friend, green-eyed, slender Abbey had laughed at the idea of twenty-

year-old, blue-eyed, blonde-haired Irene dati ng a sixty-year-old, until she had seen his

ripped pecs and bulging biceps on the trip to  the Cayman Island Henry had arrange for

the three of them and Henry's friend Rory   Edwards. Henry spent an hour in the gym

every day. His pecs, abs, and biceps were to die for.

       But no longer. Henry was in the ground, dead  from the car crash that took his life

and that of his Mercedes. Both were bl ackened hulks now, one buried in the ground of

exclusive Peach Barrow Cemetery, the other in a police impound lot. She would miss that

Mercedes.

       The doorbell rang a third time and Irene stood. She placed the magazine on the

end table in its place next to the previous month's issue. All things in their place in Irene's

living room. All things in their place.

       Her heels clicked on the marble of the f  oyer. She paused in front of the gold-

edged mirror. Her level, blue-eyed stare  answered her look. Her shoulder-length blonde

hair was pulled back into a tight bun, the same  style she had worn to Henry's funeral. A

thigh-length black skirt covered her volupt  uous chest and buttocks. Below the perfect

hem of the dress, her legs reached exactly  to the floor. The three inch heels accentuated

the bulge of her calf. The mirror had no   doubt she was a beautiful, strong woman. Nor

would any man have doubted it, nor many wome n, at least those women so inclined to

appreciate a perfect female body. Irene knew many who did. Abbey for one.

       Checking her eyes one last time for a ny redness, she pulled open the door, and

said in her contralto voice, "Yes, may I help you?"
       Andrew Venice had heard many contralto  voices before, but none attached to a

woman as beautiful as the one standing befo re him right then. Blue-eyed, blonde-haired,

and round in all the right places, Irene Stevens, the mistress of the burnt and blackened

millionaire industrialist and ex-body-builder Henr y Archer, was a sight that sent a shiver

down his rock-solid, forty-year-old body. What  that now blackened old geezer had seen

in this twenty-year-old beauty was clear. What she had seen in him was his money.

       Andrew Venice knew her type well. He  saw them on Peach Bottom Avenue, the

ladies of the night who came out to offer   their nylon- and fishnet-covered wares. Irene

Stevens was the same, but her price was hi  gher when she could get it. Looking at the

well-filled skirt she wore, Andrew Venice expect ed that she would fetch that price for a

long time to come. Until the Botox stopped wo  rking and the force of gravity could no

longer be fought.

       "Hello, I'm Andrew Venice, police detectiv e," he said in his deep voice. "We met

briefly at your... friend Henry Archer's funeral."

       Irene knew what Andrew Venice was thinking, that she was a high-priced whore,

a woman of the night. She was, but it was a velvet night with champagne stars.

       "I know who you are, and I know what you' re thinking," Irene said. "But you're

wrong where it counts most."

       "I bet I am. May I come in, Miss Stevens."

       "Do I have a choice?" she asked, stepping aside.

       "We all have choices, Miss Stevens."

       Irene led the buff police detective into the living room.

       "What do you want with me during my time of grief?"
       "Answers, Miss Stevens. Answers to some questions."

       "Ask your questions, Police Detective." Sh e sat on the sofa and crossed her legs

slowly. The slide of nylon on nylon was the rasp of a thousand tiny saws.

       "I'll come straight to the point. We know Henry Archer was murdered."

       Irene stood, her hand over her left breast. "Murdered? How do you know?"

       The act was good, Andrew thought. Very   good indeed. Andrew could almost

believe the shock was real.

       "Forensics, Miss Stevens. Forensics."

       "Oh, forensics." The police detective was watching her closely. He'd meant to

startle her, to scare her. Perhaps he suspected her. The thought scared her and excited her

at the same time. Her, Irene Stevens, a suspect in the murder of Henry Archer.

       "The brakes on his car had been tampered with, Miss Stevens."

       The thought of Henry stamping uselessly  on the German-made break pedal of his

Mercedes over and over again to no avail sent a shiver down Irene's spine. Her stomach

clenched at the thought of Henry's last frantic moments. She hoped that his last desperate

thoughts were of her. Surely he had not been thinking of his wife Callie.

       "How horrid!"

       "Indeed. But I face the horrid every day, Miss Stevens."

       "How do you do it?"

       "With a strong stomach and a thousand push-ups every morning."

       Irene could see the cut of Andrew Ve  nice's body even through the dark suit he

were. For a police detective, the suit's quality  seemed out of place, Italian, if she guessed

right. The bulge at his side was not just from the gun in its holster.
       Andrew continued, "Someone with access to the car, someone close to him,

someone who knew German cars, someone who perhaps spent a year in school in Munich

and took auto shop there, tampered with the breaks on his car causing it to carom out of

control on Peach Valley Road on that fateful night."

       "I went to school in Germany! I took auto shop!"

       "I know."

       "But-- but--"

       "I know quite a bit about you, Miss Stev ens. I know you are -- I mean, were, --

Henry Archer's mistress. I know you were one of the last people to see him alive."

       "But when my father was stationed in   Germany, we studied the C230 in auto

class. Henry drove an E-series."

       "Not hard for a dedicated murderer to figure out, Miss Stevens."

       "I did not murder Henry!"

       "Then who did, Miss Stevens? Tell me and I'll go easy on you."

       "I know nothing about it."

       "A day after Henry's death, you were seen  coming out of Rory Edward's house."

It was a lie. Andrew Venice didn't like saying it,  but Irene Stevens was a nut that he had

to crack one way or another, and he didn'  t mind using all his bastard police detective

techniques to do it.

       "I-- I-- Rory's a friend. A friend of both Henry and I. He was comforting me. Rory

even went with us to the --"

       "Cayman Islands. Yes, I know that too,"   Andrew Venice said with satisfaction.

"Do you know what Archer and Edwards were doing in the Caymans, Miss Stevens."
       "Yes, of course. We were spending tim  e on the beach. And in the evening we

went dancing." It had been an absolutely w onderful time, three days of sun and fun with

her best friend and her best man. She had wo  rn a red bikini that was a size too small.

Abbey had been jealous and Henry had been wild about it. The perfect vacation.

       "And in the mornings he and Edwards visited their bankers to deposit large sums

of cash."

       "I slept in. I wouldn't know."

       "Don't lie to me! Tell me what you know      of Rory Edwards and his business

venture with Henry Archer!"

       "I don't know anything, I tell you! Henry and  Rory were just friends. That's all I

know."

       Andrew was nearly certain she knew nothi ng, but he had one last gambit to play.

And then perhaps he could trust her and use her to help him find the real killer.

       "I have enough evidence to charge you with the murder of Henry Archer. You

had access and motive. You have the skills and the desire. Tell me what I want to know."

       "Motive! What motive would I have to kill Henry Archer?"

       "His reconciliation with Callie Archer.   He was leaving you for his wife. You

couldn't stand the thought that he might dump you."

       "Leave me for his wife? Absurd!"

       "Then you'd be out in the cold. Would  your long legs and full body ever get you

another man as rich as Henry Archer? You couldn't afford to lose him. But Rory Edwards

is almost as rich. Did he put you up to this?"

       "I don't know what you're talking about."
       Andrew took Irene by the arm, squeezing her with a strong hand. Her knees

sagged as he shook her.

       "I'm talking murder, Miss Stevens. Cold-blooded murder, planned by his business

partner and executed by his jealous mistress."

       Irene burst into tears, and she wailed, "I loved Henry! I loved him so much."

       Andrew stepped back. Even while crying, Irene Stevens was a beautiful woman,

and, as all his honed instincts told him, innocent.

       "I'm sorry for your loss, Miss Steven  s. And I'm sorry for putting you through

that."

       Irene Stevens turned away from him.

       "Damn you," she hissed.

       "Yes, damn me. I'll find my own way out."

       The door slammed, echoing through the cavernous emptiness of the apartment.

Irene wiped the tears from her eyes. They ha d served their purpose. Andrew Venice was

convinced she was innocent.
                                       
        And then there was that time they all we  nt to see the Atlanta Braves at Turner

Field.  Irene Stevens couldn't have been mo  re excited. Their seats were great. Andrew

Venice had dugout tickets for the season, as he  always did, being so incredibly well set

up. Andrew called Irene and said he was taking Richard Issacs to the next game and

would she like to come too because they would love to have her along and she, of course

said, shrieked really, YES! YES, OF COURSE!

        Irene loved the energy and commotion of   the enormous crowd in the stadium.

She loved their front row seats, right up next to the green railing where she was currently

draped over the bar watching the players or watching their cute butts avidly. Andrew was
a marvelous guy. He really was. She was c onsidering coming onto him because he was

like 20 years younger than Henry, god rest his  soul. And he was nice looking to sort of

like George Clooney on a good day and a little like Rowan Atkinson on other days but

Rowan was in his own way a little hottie reall y. After Henry any man would appear a bit

on the small side by comparison anyway. And not nearly, nearly as rich.

        Richard didn't have as sweet a persona lity as Andrew but then few men did but

he was very well-built. He had the shoulders  of a water buffalo and the waist of a ferret.

He was reddened by his many sporting activitie  s which he managed to keep up within

addition to his busy job as a stock broker, a nd that reminded Irene of safari hunters and

virile construction workers which contracted  quite sexily to his suit-and-tie demeanor.

Irene was considering coming onto him but he  was older than Henry was when he died

even though he hadn't died of natural causes  but he was dead and  Richard would die too

someday.

        Both of the men couldn't have been nicer to Irene and she was literally basking in

their solicitors attentiveness. They nestle  d her cozily in between them and heaped

compliments upon compliments upon her. Then they started talking about the ballplayers

and discussing their merits which started to bore Irene a little, really, although she was

far too sweet a girl to ever let on. For a while she had amused herself with deciding

which of the players had the sexiest name    but finally she was stuck between Roman

Colon and Armando Almanza and evens that diversion got boring.

        So she leapt out of her seat and lean ed over the railing to watch the game more

closely and wish that baseball uniforms were n't so concealing of the many lovely male

bodies sweating in the heat of the sun bea  ting down on the picturesque turf spread out
like a vast green carpet where someone ha     d vacuumed with mathematical precision

making these swish marks in the shag that    made neat patterns on the carpet that just

scream it's clean and recently vacuumed until someone walks around and then all you get

are just footprints everywhere and finally   the carpet just gets squished down and sick

looking.

        Irene still listened to the conversation   the men were having because she was a

good listener but it was like they were talking  in code and trying to figure out what they

were saying was beginning to bug her. She wa  s ultra aware that her very short shorts

were giving her a wedgie just short of b ecoming thongs only she didn't have a thong on

or anything else on but the shorts. Except her  tight T-shirt, that is. She didn't mind that

Andrew and Venice were seeming to stare more  at her than the ballplayers because she

figured she was more interesting anyway.    She tossed her long blonde hair back and

chewed her bottom lip wondering what Richar  d had meant when he said to Andrew,

"Hell, yes, I'll inform. I'm an informant. That's what I do, and I inform."

        Andrew seemed to know instantly, though.   He said back to Richard in a low

voice "I've been a police detective for a long time and I've got plenty of people reading

skills so I already knew this long before you told me."

        They kept talking about that on a nd on and it was boring and bugging Irene who

was no fool for a young woman in her twenties, if  only just barely in her twenties at that,

and she had heard the rumors flying around   Atlanta but no one was going to pull the

grape vine over her eyes. Some people were   thinking there was something suspicious

about Henry's tragic car accident, god rest    his soul. And if there was something

suspicious about it then there was SO      MEONE suspicious behind the something
suspicious. And that someone could only be     someone like her or Henry's wife, that

arrogant woman.

        It was hard not to miss Henry and how  well he made her feel about herself and

all. They had spent so many fun hours together at Henry's private gym where he showed

her his former bodybuilding techniques that  produced that massive pecs and washboard

abs and he loved to watch her on the treadm  ill. Business talk made her head hurt and

Henry despite being a millionaire industria  list never talked about business much. He

sometimes talked about his wife Callie and Irene didn't mind listening to him talk about

Callie because every other phrase practica  lly was "not like YOU, my sweet Georgia

moonpie" and she had to agree with him that Callie was pure unadulterated evil.

        And now she had to think about business  because she'd lost Henry and while her

apartment was paid up for the year she kne w Henry couldn't renew her lease and she'd

have to come up with a plan for her future. Sh e'd responded to an ad, well, a flyer, really,

that had been tucked under her windshield  wiper about a month ago although it was hard

to remember how long ago it had been afte r Henry had perished unexpectedly. But she

was clearly on her way to a fabulous career    because of that ad. It had sounded very

exciting--Educational Opportunity to Ente r the Glamorous World of Pampered Porn

Stars! The price was steep but Irene's bank   account had been left in a healthy state

because of Henry and her sometimes wished Henry was still as healthy too but his legacy

might provide her with a future after all.

        She'd called the number on the pastel pink  sheet that very evening and chatted to

Jack and Steve for hours about their course   which included the latest in analysis with

sophisticated computer software that monitored her daily progress in a scientific manner.
She signed up and began her lessons right  away, which she found extremely enjoyable.

Computers were everywhere and they had  all these cameras hooked up to the computers

to analyze her performances from every angl e to give her constant feedback about what

she could improve on during her next lesson.   It was all very high tech and Irene was

impressed with the program Jack and St     eve had designed and the selflessness they

exhibited throwing themselves into her education as they tirelessly taught her just what it

takes to be a major adult motion picture star  even if they were Geeks who wore glasses

and white socks and watches with lots of buttons when they were having sex.

        They said one of her hottest natural   talents was the ability to make beautiful

stringers, which were x-rated parlance for spit,  really. Jack said it was even more of an

asset in the business than her naturally  large bosoms and her preternaturally voluptuous

hips and buttocks. Steve said if they ever   ran out of lube on the set Irene would be

invaluable. Irene's lessons were taking up a lo t of her time and they were even tossing in

free hours of tuition anytime she came over to their place. They always sent her home

with lots of material to study, from pie charts showing exactly how much time she'd spent

doing DPs and reverse cowgirls and so onto DVDs  that she was to watch to gain insights

into how the actresses excelled at facials, which wasn't her forte so far, but apparently

grinning while getting hit in the eye was essential in the business and Irene couldn't stand

her eyelashes clumping together so she was still working hard on getting used to that.

        Andrew said in a growl voice, "We will   get to the bottom of this" and Richard

harrumphed in a good-natured but skeptical  way. Irene suddenly felt famished and told

the two that she was going to go to a concession stand for a bite to eat and then she had to

practically beat them off with a stick if she'  d had a stick, that is, to get them to let her
goes by herself which she really wanted to  do because she wasn't sure what she wanted

when she got there.

        The bustle and noise of the audience  made her feel like a stalking goddess who

prowled through a jungle of people, like a     beautiful unique bird of prey swooping

through the vast flocks of awed penguins,  secretly powerful and utterly desired by each

man that walked by her and she felt her vol uptuous chest swell with happiness at how it

felt to be in her soft peachy skin but fi  rm, too, like a fresh peach, not something over-

ripened in a cut-rate grocery store that's  been sitting out getting squeezed by pensioners

too many times before ending up being carel essly self-bagged and dropped off a counter

in a rusted-out double-wide trailer in a run-down trailer park.

        She was walking away from Frankly My   Dear with her footlong drenched in

mayo and mustard and ketchup and relish a     nd had just wrapped her warm pink lips

around the large hotdog when a young man had stared at her with a frozen expression as

he slowly reached up and removed his baseba ll cap and held it reverently over his heart.

"You-you-you," he stammered as she tried to sm ile sweetly and yet finish taking the bite

of her hotdog. "You-you-you're . . . " he continued valiantly. "You-you're Voluptia!"

        Irene was slightly puzzled but quickly    concluded that he must have meant

"voluptuous" so she nodded and said thank you.

        "I go there every day," he said and Ire   ne said "Where's that?" and he said

"Double u double u double u dot ex ex ex dot com" and Irene was totally baffled and told

him to have a really nice day after she swallowed.

        It was like the whole world spoke in c ode sometimes and Irene did not plan on

becoming a cryptographer because it gave her  a headache to worry herself over what the
world went on and on about. But Irene's   dreams of being somebody someday were as

nourishing as a footlong on a bright sunny day  in a place full of screaming fans and the

smells of mens' colognes and spilled beer a nd admiring glances that followed her all the

way back to the dugout where Richard and   Andrew welcomed her returning presence

with open arms. They even agreed her hotdog,  what was left of it, looked delish and that

her condiments were creative. Irene beamed with love for the whole world and hummed

"Take me out of the ball game" beneath her  breath and generally relaxed in the sensual

warmth of the day with her head leaned   over on Andrew's hard chest and her toes in

Richard's lap getting rubbed while Andrew stroked her honey silken hair around her

apricot ears and lingered over her sun-flushed cheeks with gently tantalizing fingers.

        So she dozed off for a while and      missed the Braves scoring the winning

touchdown but she awoke when the crowd  exploded with joy and hugged Richard and

Andrew in an outpouring of pure happiness, really, except for the bit about missing

Henry, god rest his soul, of course.
                                        

        Callie pulled up into the driveway and turned the key.  She sat for a moment and

stared at the house.  It was a crimson scarle t red color with a sharply slanted roof, which

was graced with a cacophony of Christmas lights  that twinkled and sparkled like colored

stars.  It reminded her of her own house, w ith her own Christmas lights, and she smiled a

soft smile.  She loved Christmas.  It re  minded her of when her family would huddle

around the tree, singing songs and opening presents.  For twenty years they had used the

same tree, a tall, broad pine that smelled fain tly of pine.  She loved that tree, so much so

that she never took it down.  For thirty years,  she kept the tree just as it was, awash with

lights and shiny balls.  Henry thought her daft, and oft his accounting friends would come

over for Easter dinner and see the tree standing proud in the corner with its lights and
balls and Henry would try to quickly shoo them to the dining room but they would have

none of that as theyd stand before the tree and rub their chins in thought and say in their

funny accents its over, you know but Callie w  ould just smile her soft smile as she

spooned out the mashed potatoes.

        Callie stepped out of the car and shook  the chill from her voluptuous bones.  The

snow crackled beneath her feet as she made  her way along the driveway and up the icy

steps, taking each with care.  It reminded her of the church and their icy steps, only much

more so.  She knocked on the door, which     made a muffled hollow sound beneath her

knuckles, like the sound of an unripe cantaloupe.  She was picky about her cantaloupes.

        The door opened and Callie was greeted  with her friend Yvonne.  Callie smiled

and shifted voluptuously as she stared at he r friend.  She reminded her of a volcano, her

molten red hair flowing moltenly down her back and over the sandy white beaches of her

shoulders, as hair is wont to do.  Yvonne   smiled back, her lips glossed in a shade of

lipstick that reminded Callie of the house paint.

        Come in, Yvonne said, her scintillating green eyes dancing playfully in the

evening darkness.

        Callie closed the door behind her and to ssed her coat onto a nearby chair.  She

took a seat on the couch and ran her fingers  along the coffee table, breathing deeply the

dark and heady aroma of furniture polish.

        Yvonne slinked towards the kitchen.  Dinners almost ready.  Make yourself at

home.

        Callie stood and straightened her cashmere dress and proceeded to a small bar on

the other side of the living room.  The plus h carpeting squished between her toes and she
smiled a soft smile.  It reminded her of the  dreamy times she had spent with her beloved

Henry shopping for carpeting.  Shed happily sk   ip between rolls of pastel blues and

ruddy browns and giggle as she rubbed her ch eek against their fuzziness.  The salesmen

were always quick to help her, no doubt as    delighted with carpeting as she was, and

cheerfully waved goodbye when they left, a roll of bunny-patterned carpet hoisted on one

of Henrys broad shoulders and Callie clinging lovingly to the other.

        Callie examined the bottles and swished the contents of a few.  She tapped her

chin and foot as she pondered over her decision.   Scotch?  No.  Vodka?  No.  Rum?  No.

Tequila?  No.  Gin?  No.  Re d Wine?  No.  White Wine?  No.  rosé Wine?  No.  Sherry?

No.  Very Dry Sherry?  No.  Brandy?  N     o.  Grand Marnier?  No.  Vermouth?  No.

Crème de Cacao?  No. Crème de Menthe?  No.  Schnapps?  No.  Whiskey?  No.

Bourbon?  No.  Rye?  No.  Ick.

        Callie sashayed towards the bookshelf w  ith its myriad of books.  She ran her

fingertips along the spines and was amazed      at the wide variety that Yvonne had

collected.  Tall books, thin books, fat books , short books, books with brown covers,

books with white covers, books without cove rs, hard books, soft books, hard books that

felt like soft books, and everything in between.   It reminded her of a library with lots of

books.

        Yvonne emerged from the kitchen bearing a large plate with a large ham on top

which had small cherries and small pieces     of pineapple stuck into it with wooden

toothpicks.  The scent of ham and cherry  and pineapple wafted languidly towards Callie

and she breathed deeply of its heavenly scent.

        It smells heavenly, Callie noted, and Yvonne grinned impishly.
        Callie took a seat at the table and unfurled her napkin.  She placed it on her lap as

she was always taught and arranged her silverwa re just so.  She poured herself a glass of

milk from the fridge and began scooping out potatoes for the both of them.

        Yvonne poured herself a drink and melted  into the chair across from Callie.  She

brushed a strand of moltenly hair from her ey es and proceeded to carve the ham.  Callie

watched intently.  Juice streamed from the  ham in rivulets like saliva drooling from the

fierce jaws of a wild dingo poised over the dead carcass of its prey in the dingo-eat-dingo

world.

        It smells heavenly, Callie said.

        Yvonne dropped a slab onto Callies eager ly awaiting plate and garnished it with

a cherry.  Callie popped the cherry into her mouth and smiled a soft smile.  Its sweetness

reminded her of sweet things and that made her smile.

        Yvonne dabbed at the corner of her m outh with a napkin and washed down the

ham with a chug of wine.  I bought that lovely dress today, she chirped excitedly.

        Which one? Callie inquired.

        The lovely one, Yvonne explained.

        What does Roberto think of it? Callie queried.

        Yvonne giggled like a giggly girl.  He th inks its lovely, she responded as she

shifted voluptuously in her seat.

        Youre a lucky woman, Callie commented, tossing her mane voluptuously.

She sighed vehemently.  I do so really very much miss Henry.

        At--least he--didnt--leave you broke, Y vonne grunted as she struggled with a

particularly fatty piece of ham.
        I looked across the table at Yvonne ne rvously and stood, making my way to the

living room window.  I could see the colors   of Christmas blinking rhythmically in the

windows reflection and it eased my heart    somewhat, though not a lot.  I swallowed

nervously as I tried to think of the best wa  y to say to my friend what I wanted to say,

because it was hard to say.  Words stumbled in my mind like clumsy children falling

down a flight of stairs, and I went to the   bathroom to relieve my increasingly incessant

bladder.  The smell of lilac assaulted me and I smiled softly.  I sat and tinkled.  The

sound reminded me of my sisters wedding.       It was a grand affair, with balloons and

streamers and clowns, and my sister all dre ssed up in a brilliant white, white dress, and

the soothing tinkling sound of the raindrops in the punch bowl.

        I returned to find Yvonne spooning gobs of  custard into a bowl.  Dessert? she

questioned.

        Callie shook her head.  Im a vegetarian.

        Yvonne nodded vigorously and took her         custard to the living room.  Is

something wrong? she asked me.

        Callie baby-stepped her way to the living room.  Its about my stocks.

        What about them? Yvonne muffled through her custard.

        I-- Callie stammered.  Her gut knotted and she took a bite of Yvonnes custard.

She loved the cool fruitiness on her tongue and  she smiled softly.  I want to sell them,

she finally said at last.

        Why? Yvonne spewed.

        Callie took a seat at the kitchen table.   I loved Henry, she insisted, really

meaning it.  But its time for me to move onto greener pastures.
        Yvonne shrugged voluptuously.  So sell them.

        Ah! Callie said knowingly.  Therein lies the rube.  I dont want to be seen like

Im bailing out of a sinking ship.  And I hear d through the cherry vine that you might be

able to help me, if you get my meaning, she hinted with knowing winks.

        No, Yvonne said with a deep negativity.

        The corners of Callies mouth droope    d like saggy breasts.  Why not? she

interrogated.

        Because, Yvonne quipped.

        Because.  The word reminded Callie of  grade school and Mrs. Freemans history

class where she had learned of the cotton  gin and asked why it was called a cotton gin

when it had nothing to do with gin and Mrs. Freeman glared at her as she often did and

with stern arms folded across her rigid chest   she said because and left it at that and

Callie smiled softly.

        Please? Callie pleaded.

        Im sorry, Callie, Yvonne sighed sorrowf ully.  I wish I could help you but I

have my own green pastures to think a     bout.  Roberto and I--what we have been a

beautiful thing.  A truly beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing, and I cant risk losing such a

beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing.

        Callie eyes narrowed, so imperceptibly  that no one even noticed.  Even for a

friend? she warned.

        Youre a beautiful friend, Yvonne sighe d.  But what Roberto and I share are

more beautifully beautiful than our commonly beautiful friendship.
        Callie rubbed her suddenly throbbing head  with her fingertips in slow, two-and-

three-quarter inch circles.  Fine, she   half-spat, one-quarter shrieked, one-quarter

shouted, and she snatched her coat from the couch.  She flung open the door and stormed

outside, her bosom heaving with rage, stopping only long enough to smash a twinkling

Christmas light with the heel of her shoe.
                                        

       It was early morning in the first part   of the day.  The sun was just coming up.

Bruce sat at his morning breakfast table.  the newspaper was in front  of him.  His black

silk monogrammed dressing gown barely concealed the rippling muscles of his chest and

back.  You could tell he had not shaved yet  from the dense yet attractive forest of blonde

stubble on his cleft chin and sculpted cheeks.   He rubbed his aquiline nose.  Then, when

he reached up to push, the soft blonde hair    back from his manly forehead, his hand

encountered the bandages still there.

       He frowned, the gesture making ripples   of thought on his brow between the

limpid blue pools that were his eyes. I must  remember what happened! he told himself

sternly, his deep, resonant voice trembling huskily withemotion.  He still could not recall
anything about the automobile accident that  had sent him to the hospital with a severe

head injury.  That the bandage on his head now covered the 18 sutures that a topnotch

surgeon at St. Ivans hospital had spent so   long in carefully suturing into his brow. He

tried and tried until sweat popped out on the sm  ooth skin of his forehead and glistened

there, but he could still not remember a damn th ing!  Damn it!  He had to!  He just had

to!

       Meow! said the neighbors cat at th  e window.  It was not Bruces cat, but

sometimes he let it in and fed it.  It was a very expensive purebred Siamese.  Had the cat

but known it, his blue eyes were exactly th  e same shade of the limpid blue pools that

were Bruces eyes.

       Go away! shouted Bruce, his despair and confusion making him

uncharacteristically grumpy with the cat that he sometimes fed and petted.  Just leave

me alone!

       But an instant later, he regretted his temper.  He opened the window and let the

cat in.  He found some milk  for it in the refrigerator, and carefully chopped up some left

over cooked chicken livers and a few sardines in  a can that was in there.  The cat purred

while he ate it.  Would that I could be as  sublime as you, a small feline friend? Bruce

said wearily, sadly, depressedly.  He petted the cat a few times, and then went back to his

chair. He sat down on it.  Outside the wi ndow, it was morning, the sun was just coming

up.  The wind was blowing sweetly through the   Georgia pines.  He thought, for just a

moment, how lucky he was to live in Atlanta,  Georgia in the southern part of the United

States.
       Suddenly, Bruces eyes fell on the newspape r on the table in front of him.  The

headlines seemed to shriek at him!

Millionaire Industrialist Henry Archer Dead at Age 60!

Tragic Car accident claims His Life!

Callie Archer now widowed!

       His eyes crawled frantically over the newspaper, devouring the awful and

confusing details of the death.  The reporter had written a good but a gristly report on the

millionaires death.  Bruce cringed as he read  of the bright star of blood on the shattered

windshield where Henry Archers head had sm ashed against it.  The reporter noted that

the mans body still gripped a cell phone in one  lifeless hand after he was dead.  Had he

been talking on the phone when he died?  Bruce hated it when drivers in other cars talked

on the phone when they were driving.  It wa  s certainly a dangerous and rude practice.

Perhaps Henry Archers death had been the result of his own rudeness and carelessness in

driving while talking on a cell phone.

       Then his eyes were suddenly trapped like  wolves in jaw traps.  One single detail

from the newspaper article seized him by the throat and squeezed like a noose around his

neck.  It was the date and time of the accident.  4:03 P.M. on July 20th!

       No!  It cant be!  Bruce shouted the   words. He stood up from his chair.  The

Siamese neighbors cat jumped in terror.  Meow! it cried piteously.  Meow!  Meow!

       Im sorry, Pitty-Pat! Bruce apologized  to the Siamese cat.  I didnt mean to

startle you.  But I think that Henry Archers  accident happened at the same date and time

that mine did!  Oh, look at me! What am I coming to, talking to a cat?  Im a successful

software developer, not some kind of a crazy man.  Arent I?
       He stood up from his chair.  He paced around the room.  Then he made himself go

to his leather, monogrammed briefcase and take out the doctors report from his

hospitalization.  His eyes slid swiftly down the papers, then suddenly snagged on the very

information he sought. There it was!  The doctor had written down that the emergency

medical people from the ambulance that brought  him to the hospital had thought that his

accident had probably happened at 4:03 P.M. on July 20th!  The very same day and time

that Henry Archers accident had happened.

       He exclaimed, It has to be a coincidence!   It just has to! Bruce shouted.  Then

he made himself calm down.

       He walked back to his kitchen table a nd sat down.  He looked at the newspaper

there.  The bloody tragic headlines still sc  reamed their unimaginable news up at him.

Below the big print of the large headline wa  s a society photo of He nry Archer and his

wife Callie Archer.  Callie was in a breat htaking lace evening gown by Christian Dior.

Beside her, looking stricken by his wifes  breathtaking beauty, was Henry Archer in an

impeccable black tuxedo by Ralph Lauren and  a white shirt and blacks tie. Even covered

by a tuxedo, Bruce could see that Henry Ar cher had still the muscular body of the body

builder he had once been but was no more  now that he was sixty years old.  Diamonds

glittered on an immense pendant at Callie Arch ers throat.  Diamonds bigger than pearls

hung from her earlobes, shining like soft icicle s.  Well, at least she will have a lot of

money now that hes dead.  At least she  isnt left poor and destitute, pushing a shopping

cart down the street and living in a cardboard box in an alley and eating left over

McDonalds food from a Dumpster.  At least theres that to be thankful for!
       Then the coincidence of the times of death hit him all over again.  Can there be a

connection? he had to ask himself.  Meo     w! said Pitty-Pat, his soulful blue eyes

shining up at Bruce.  The cat seemed to want  to help him. Cats are naturally sympathetic

animals, and Pitty-Pat was no exception.  He could see that the big, muscular human who

sometimes fed him chicken gizzards and salmon was distressed.  His little heart went out

to the man.  Meow! he said again, softly.

       Bruce stooped down and petted the cat.      I know you want to help. Cats are

naturally sympathetic animals.  I just don t think theres any way you can help me, little

fellas!

       I have to do this myself.  I have to find out the details of my car accident.  I have

to remember exactly what happened to me   that day!  Im the only one who can do it,

Pitty-Pat!  The only one.

       Bruce decided to get dressed. First, he would take a shower, being very careful of

the bandage on his 12 stitches that now seamed  his forehead.  He went to his bathroom.

It was tiled in sandstone and umber.  The    towels matched.  He stepped into the hot

stinging spray of the shower, dropping his s ilken bathrobe behind him on the mat like a

discarded flower petal.  He took up a big   bar of sandalwood soap and soaped the dark

mat of hair on his chest.  He washed under hi s arms, and then his legs and feet.  Then he

washed his arms and neck.  He wished he  could shampoo his hair, but that would get his

bandage wet.  So he had to not do it today.    He rinsed the soap off himself and then

stepped out of his shower and toweled off.   He was glad he kept his body in such good

shape.  Someday, a woman would appreciate what good care he had taken of himself, and

the firm muscles that corded his bronzed   arms.  Not many software developers cared
what they looked like. Some of the soft   ware developers he knew looked like soggy

mushroom people who had lived too long in the  moist dark of their offices.  Not Bruce.

He knew that this was the only body he would ev er get and that he had to take care of it.

If not for himself, then for the love a  nd admiration of the woman who would someday

share its pleasure with him.

       He got dressed quickly.  He put on Eddie Bauer taupe slacks and a shirt in a pale

blue plaid.  He pulled on a pair of black  boots.  He looked good, in a rugged, out-doorsy

way.  You wouldnt have l     ooked at him and thought, hes a computer software

developer.  You would have thought he         was a forest ranger or maybe even a

mountaineer guide.  He looked at the mirror   and smiled a sad smile.  Yes.  He looked

tough today.  But he would have to be tough, too.

       He knew what he should do.  He should go st raight to Callie Archer.  That would

get him the information he needed.  Hed be  able to discover if his terrible car wreck and

Henry Archers terrible car accident were conn ected in any way.  He tried not to think of

Callie Archer as she had looked in the newspaper photograph.  He would not think of her

soft blonde hair in ringlets on her pale forehea d, or her soft brown eyes staring out of the

page at him.  She would be well-taken care  of. That was what was important, wasnt it?

That she didnt end up living out on the streets now that her wealthy industrialist husband

was dead.

       Goodbye, Pitty-Pat! he said as he left the apartment.

       Meow! the cat replied.  It was as much  of an answer to his questions as Bruce

Lucent would get that day!

                                        

    The funeral had been hell. Funerals are bad enough when you don't know the dead guy

at all. And they're a pain when you just have   to show up socially or else everyone will

think you're ungrateful jerks with no respect for someone decent and kind (as all dead

guys are irregardless of how they lived their rotten, two-timing sadistic, pathetic,

discombobulatedly senseless, irreligious,  unthinking, flakes, debauched, foulmouthed,

obnoxious, deviant, gross, adulterous, murd erous, gluttonous, alcoholic, lazy, indolent,

filthy, grotesquely indecent, lunatic, lives), or that you've just come for the food

afterwards or to show off your latest dress, or to spit in the coffin while nobody's looking.

And funerals for true beloved dead guys     are awful because after all, someone you'd

wanted to spend your whole life with is dead  in the coffin and although he's really stiff
now, you'll never get to enjoy that ever  again, and all those people around you, all that

hypocrisy and sycophant and wallflowers and showoffs are all gabbing and staring at you

and critiquing your red eyes and the running  mascara and eyeshadow and expecting you

to be brave or hold it all in or keep a sti ff upper lip or expecting you to go out with them

afterwards and let them ball you senselessly so you can forget the dead guy and fall

passionately in lust with them instead and   besides it's all so bloody expensive that it's

going to use up most of the insurance settleme   nt and the estate and then what is you

supposed to live on for hell's sake.

       Even worse are funerals for beloved dead guys who were married to someone else

so you have to go kind of in disguise and   make like you were just friends with the guy

instead of having wild sex with him and trying out every page of the karma sutra together

and wondering just how the heck you were   supposed to live now, although since you

aren't liable for the bloody expensive funera l you might come out more or less even or

even ahead of his wife and kids in that   department. That was the kind of funeral Irene

Stevens had gone to.

       And the lutz had been inconsiderate e nough to get himself killed driving Irene's

sporty little Maserati that he had bought for her -- bent it and broke it and splattered it

with his blood

and ichor, all kinds of body fluids, all more or  less foul and sticky and all resonant over

what was left of the rich ripe red l  eather upholstery -- though the insurance settlement

from that ought to help her get on with her     life, especially if she invested it wisely.

Maybe it could finance some education so sh  e could be a model or and actresses or a

porn star or something. She'd have to talk to the guys down at the club -- if she could still
get into the club now that Henri was dead so she couldn't go in on his arm or to meet him

or to exercise and keep her body nice and svelte and trim and athletic for him because she

for damn sure didn't want to lose him to    some tramp like that Margaret Eastman or

whoever.

       That Margaret! Geez, she'd showed up at  that funeral bawling her eyes out like

they'd been best buds or lovers or so  mething. What a hypocrite. Probably hoping she

could get a job from one of his friends or   get laid by some hopeful dude there for the

widows and orphans or something.

       Afterwards she went back to their condo, her condo now, with the Jacuzzi and his

den and all the clothes and jewelry he'd bought her and all that high class furniture and

stuff. Henry had a thing for leather. Leather   sofas, leather chairs, a leather mattress for

hell's sake, leather underwear, the leather whips and manacles, even a braided leather

carpet that they'd made love on more than  once. She'd have to clean out the den. Henry

had not let her go in there for ages, maybe     .  There were bodies in there, like in

Bluebeard: all the dismembered bodies of your  maidens that he'd carried off and secretly

ravaged before cruelly cutting them to bits. She'd stayed out of it like he said, never once

peeking into his den, so she still had all her bits, and then some. Amazing what they

could do with silicone and saline these days.

       His den! Henry holed up in his den like      a wild beast, hoarding his pray and

coming out to hunt when he hungered for food or  lusted for sex or thirsted for liquor or

water or will or juice. The back to his den  or out to hunt the lives and fortunes of other

men or off to his wife, that  abominable Callie Archer who took up so much of his time.

But he always came back, always came back for her athletic body and her wild sex and
her Margarita and tequila sunrises and omel ettes and steaks and chops and their video

tapes, the ones recorded by the hidden cameras  in the bedroom when they made love like

wild beasts, like penguins of the Sahara di ving into the sand and rutting wildly after

feasting on sand sharks. She envied those penguins. All that hot sand to swim through,

the raspy grains sliding over their feathers as   they hunted in wild packs, baying at the

moon, and diving deep, deep, down into the dusty depths of the dry smooth sand.

       What would penguin leather be like? W  ould it have lots of dense patterns of

whirls where the feathers grew, like ostr   ich leather did? Perhaps she could have

something made of penguin

leather to remind her of Henry, a love seat or  a fine set of whips and straps. Perhaps she

might travel to the Sahara someday to watc h them from the tops of the pyramids, Mount

Fujiyama off in the distance, duplicating the  smooth slanted sides of the pyramids. Oh,

Henry, you jerk, why didn't you ever take me     places like that? Why didn't we travel

instead of being cooped up in hiding, in your   den, rutting like penguins or ostriches or

lions on the leather cushion and couches and chairs and rugs?

       You used to love it when I pulled on  a leather strap around your neck when we

made love. You knew I needed you too much to ever pull too long or too hard. You loved

it when I saddled you and rode you around, when I put the bit between your teeth and the

golden spurs with the softly rounded rowels to your flanks, not enough to draw blood, but

enough to goad you on, around and around th  e condo, around the balcony and up and

down the stairs, and then we'd tumble to  gather again with you panting and sweaty and

full of lust.
       Perhaps I can sell the tack to someone  with a pony. But I'll keep the spurs. The

golden spurs. And the whips.

       Just a week before Irene Stevens came back from the funeral and decided to clean

out Henry Archers den in their condo: Henry  Archer sat in his favorite red letter chair.

Irene had a thing for leather. Practically everything in the condo was leather or leather

upholstered or leather decorated or something.  Henry leaned back in his red leather chair

and mused, thinking fondly

of the cow the had given it's lif e for his comfort.  He wondered what this particular cow

had been like.  Had it had a name.  Had it  had feelings and thoughts or was it only driven

by it's own stupidity, like his last one night stand.

       A new thought occurred to him.  What if it had been made into steak, chops, soup

bones and Macdonald's veggie burgers, also.  He  remembered the steak he had eaten last

night and wondered dimly if this cow ha       d contributed to satisfying not only his

rheumatism, but his appetite as well.

       His thoughts strayed to the paper that was laying limply on the antique desktop in

front of him.  What was it that he was going  to write?  His mind seemed to be full of fog,

like the fog of New York Cit y.  He had lived there once, as a boy, before he was rich.

New York made him think of other famous cities he had visited, like France and Rome.

He wondered if they had cows in Rome.

       Henry puzzled over his letter to Irene.    He had to word his thoughts just right.

She was a beautiful woman, but his heart bel onged to Margaret Eastman.  He loved the

way her curvatiously voluptuous body fit into he r tight nurse outfit.  She was a bit older

and more cultured than Irene as well.  He let out a long sigh as he thought of her.  He dug
around in his desk until he found a cigarette and a lighter one of the drawers.  He lit up

and thought.  He needed to put it delicately a nd not break her heart.  Finally, he decided

on the perfect words.  He put pen to

paper in the same way some men puts knives to  wrists.  When he was finished he looked

over his work and smiled as he read the sentences, "Hey baby.  The sex was great.  But I

never liked blondes much anyway.  I found someone better.  Still, love ya lots, Henry."

       He had to admit it.  He was a Shakesp eare among Jerry Springers.  He placed the

letter in an envelope and addressed it to   Irene.  Then, setting the letter on his desk, he

strode out to his Mercedes to buy a diamond necklace for Margaret.

       Irene Stevens's tried the knob on the door of the den, Henry's wild den that he had

loved so much and been so secretive about. It  was unlocked and so sh e went in at last,

after all these months, now that Bluebird  was dead. Mahogany shelves lined one wall,

lined with canning jars full of clear fluid and cloudy lumps. There was an ebony desk and

a red leather chair. There were filing cabinet s and a large black safe. There was a rack of

pistols and rifles and shotguns, holsters for   the pistols and shoulder holsters and belts.

Two of the rifles had big scopes on them. And hunting knives, and fillet knives, and buck

knives in sheathes. And cameras, a small one, like a lighter, a couple of bigger ones and

three with huge lenses and tripods.

       So Bluebeard did save bits, body parts.   And he hunted. She looked at the jars:

pale fleshy bits and skin resolved into a  cock and balls, "hitchhiker, Cincinnati, August

1999" read one. An eyeball, "waitress, J une, June 2000." A kidney, "roadkill, Tennessee,

May 1998." She shuddered, but her loins warmed,  thinking of the wild beast, the hunter,

her mount . . .
       Irene looked in the file cabinet next to   the gun rack. The top drawer was filled

with ammunition, shotgun shells, rifle bullets, pistol bullets. The rest of the drawers were

filled with papers, full of names and dates,   and pictures of people doing all kinds of

things. Some of it was porno stuff, but there were other pictures, too.

       The other file cabinets were much the sa me, folders of pictures and notes. Some

good porn, but a lot of it was boring stuff. There  were some letters on top of the safe, all

addressed  to post office boxes. She opene     d one and there was money inside. She

pocketed it. She'd have to go through all this stuff. There was probably money in the safe,

too. She wondered if she could sell the jars on eBay.

       She turned to the desk. There was just  a single envelope there and her name was

on it. She opened it.

       Irene read the letter and then stood there for a long, long time. She cried at first,

but then the tears slowed and a grin surfaced, a nasty grin.

       "Last laugh, Henry. I get the last laugh. Sh e'll never have you. None of them will

have you. Ever."

       And she took the packet she'd gotten at the mortuary, the very expensive one, the

one that she'd paid the embalmer so very mu ch for. There were empty jars on the bottom

shelf, and a can

labeled "alcohol, 200 proof." She unwrapped the packet and slid the cock and balls inside

the jar, the filled it with alcohol.

       "You're mine now, Henry. You'll always be mine."

She found a label and wrote on it: "philanderer, Atlanta, March 2004".

       She put the jar on the middle shelf, next to the hitchhiker.

                                        

       Arthur Nance looked at the clipboard, in his hand.  As the main doctor at the

hospital where he worked to save people' lives it was his duty to tell them about their

disease and injuries.  But he didn't want to talk to Bruce Lucent. Bruce was a big

important software developer and didn't like  it when people or things didn't go his way.

So Arthur news wouldn't be taken well.

       He wandered to the hospital cafeteria where he got a ham sandwich to eat because

he was very hungry, it had been a very long da y and he'd had to perform surgery on two

different people since he had got to the hosp ital early that mourning. One had had a heart

attack and needed open heart surgery and the other had to have her appendices out. She

had been very pretty and he had to tell hims elf not to think about that because he had to

concentrate to take out her appendix.
       He ate his sandwich quickly and then got a Diet Doctor Pepper to drink. It was his

favorite and he got worried sometimes that    he was addicted to the sweet caffeinated

drink.

       Arthur looked at his watch. Seven fift een it was time to check on the people on

Intensive care. Including Bruce Lucent, he just  couldn't get away from him. He turned,

which way was his room again? Oh yeah it  was in the south wing. Arthur Nance turned

and started marching down the hall towards Bruce's room.

       He sighed as he marched down the hall   towards Bruce's room.  On the way he

passed a pretty nurse Margaret Eastman.  He   stared at her beautiful curves then cursed

himself silently for staring at her.  It just wa sn't proper. But it was hard not to stare at her

luminously curvaceous body and her soft curvy cleavage, she was so pretty. That was the

problem, with this hospital too many pretty  nurses and patience were here. Maybe he'd

ask her out to lunch or something sometime.

       As he continued marching down the hall Ma rgaret turned to him. Hey she said.

"Didn't I see you earlier, you were taking care of Bruce Lucent?" she queried, looking at

his nice thick muscles. He was pretty hot  she thought, maybe she would ask him to lunch

but not now. "He was in the car accident with   Henry Archer last week wasn't he," she

asked him, looking him up and down now. Oh y eah, she was hot, with all those muscles.

What a stud. But she wasn't looking for him. she was looking for Lucent,

maybe he could tell her who Irene Stevens wa s, Henry never really had but she had seen

her name on his address list.

       Arthur Nance took a drink of  his coke, savoring the cool sweet drink as is fizzed

down his throat. Yeah he was probably addict ed but he didn't really care, stress would
kill him anyway, or maybe a car crash cause th  ere were a lot of them these days, there

had been 2 in the past week, Bruce and Henry's. He would probably take up smoking

cigarettes if his boss hadn't yelled at peopl e who smoked and fired them. "Yeah, why" he

wondered? Do you want to talk to him?"

       "Yeah, I want to ask him about this girl  Irene Stevenson or something like that,

cause I think he might know her." She stated calmly.

       "Well I can't let you see him but I can  ask him for you," he declared, looking at

his watch again it was seven thirty now. "Oh  crap I need to check, on a patient" and he

turned and left her standing in the hallway.

       Arthur entered Lucent's room.  He was eating a pork chop and the doctor winced,

he was Vegan and didn't like seeing other peopl e eating meat or wearing leather like the

leather on Bruce's imported braincase.  That was leaning against the bed.

       "Hi Nancy! exclaimed Bruce who had fini shed his meal by now.  The had gotten

to know each other by now, the car crash was almost a month ago.  He sat up and grind at

Nance who didn't like being called Nancy. Because it was a girls name, and he was a

very muscular athletic guy with a lot of se xy mussels but he didn't want to upset the

software developer because he mite get mad at him.

       Lucent sat up and put the remains of his  lamb chop aside. "I was just wondering

where you were because I wanna talk to  you.  I think I'm better enough to go home now

don't you." He pointed to his neck wish no longer had to have the foam brace on it

anymore, he was glad because it itched like when he was a kid and broke his leg and had

a cast. That had itched, and so did the neck brace so he was glad he didn't have to ware it

anymore.
       I don't think that would be a good idea,"  expostulated Nance angrily.  "You still

need a lot of therapy for your leg and you can't drive again yet."

       "Then can you tell me doctor, what a      bout some people?" questioned Bruce

Lucent.

       Doctor Nance started pacing around the r  oom, back and forth, back and forth.

"Peoples lives are covered by the privacy act, Mr. Lucent." opined the doctor to his

patient.  "I can't tell you about anyone at the hospital, if that is what you mean."

       "Well it was, more about the accident that almost killed me."  Bruce Lucent sat up

straight, a dangerous look on his face.  Na nce knew Bruce was used to getting his own

way for the past few years sine he got ric  h.  So he sometimes got more violent than

sometimes another person might when the same thing was going on.

       Nance stopped pacing up and down and sat down in the chair

next to Bruce's bed.  After all what could  the software geek do?  His leg was still in

traction, or at least had been until yesterda y, and he could probabl y not move very fast

yet either.  He had good muscles though, almost as good as Nance's that he worked out

for hours to get and still had despite being olde r than Bruce.  He ran his hand through his

sandy brown hair and blurted, That's the police's job.  I know they came here more than

one time to talk to you about the accident.  They don't tell us doctors about that stuff, and

we don't need to know."

        Bruce thought about the young cop who        had questioned him.  He had been

asking questions, not telling him anything.  If he knew more about the accident, he hadn't

told Bruce.  But he bet this doctor new more than he was telling.  He could tell by

looking at his face.  It was a face that kept secrets, hundreds of secrets every day he bets.
       "You know I can make a big donation to this hospital if you can get me the

information I want." Bruce spurted out.  "You know me well enough by knowing to

know that I am the sort of person who want    s to ask questions, not answer them.  So

maybe I can make you think.  Here are some na mes and not from your hospital, either.  I

need to know who wanted Henry Archer dead.  What does Irene Stevens know about his?

No I was wrong, there is one person from the hospital, a nurse named Margaret."

       He must think I'm like a candy striper   who sits and tells everything she knows

thought Nance to himself.  Maybe I do know

something I won't tell about Henry Archer.   A candy striper named Nancy he must think.

And does he mean Margaret Eastman for the nurse in this hospital.  And how soon will

that big donation come once he's not in the hospital anymore?  He'll forget it fast enough,

and my hypocritical oath will be down the toilet.

       Bruce watched Arthur Nance's trim, m oustache face and thought that Nancy boy

wouldn't tell him anything.  He was it close down and saw the secrets hiding there.  Too

bad he had spent all his time working out or studying computers.  He didn't spend enough

time with people so he didn't know body langua ge and Arthur Nance probably spoke it

like a native.  So he could sit there with  his shoulders all hunched up and his face closed

over his secrets.  And its so oblivious that he knows what I mean and could tell me what I

want to know.

       "Alright, then since you don't want to   tell me what you know even if you do

know, how about just make me more comfor table here since you won't let me go home

either.  You could start with that pretty nur se.  She was standing outside my door talking

to one of my friends that came to visit me.   She looks like her uniform is painted on with
medium-length brown hair.  That's the nurse  I want not the one who looks like she had

prunes for breakfast and is older than my gra ndma."  Bruce sat up straight in his hospital

bed and ran his hand through his  long black hair thinking that he needed a haircut really

bad.

       "Im sorry sir but the hospital does not assign its personal

like that." spat Arthur Nance.  "If Nurse  Eastman is who you mean she isn't one of the

floor nurses on this floor so I can't assign her here anyways.

       "Then move me to her floor.  I would ge  t much better faster with her being the

one to give me shots in the butt," Bruce

Lucent expostulated.

       "She works in maternity."  That should  show him for trying to through his weight

around thought Arthur Nance to himself.  And  the way he's acting I won't tell him what I

know even if I was going to which I was but now I won't.

       "So maybe I could get pregnant?" queried Bruce Lucent hysterical.

       "When nurse Wagner tells you to do your therapy that will get you out faster than

joking with me" quipped Arthur Nance.  S     uddenly he thought to himself that Bruce

Lucent asked him about Irene Stephens a  nd so had Margaret Eastwood.  And Bruce

Lucent also asked him about a nurse who's na me was Margaret.  So what did Margaret

Eastman now?  This just made it even surer that he would not tell Bruce Lucent anything.

He could not have this sort of thing going on in his hospital!

       Arthur Nance ran his hand through his sa ndy brown hair and stood up.  "Im sure

you'll be able to go home in a few days if   you do what you're supposed to do that the

nurses tell you."
       "So what was it you came in here to tell me  anyway doctor" queried Bruce to the

doctor?

       OH nothing I was just checking to see how your leg was out of it's cast and if you

still needed the neck brace.  You better used that neck brace when you use your computer

you have there."  Arthur Nance pointed to the  laptop compeer case next to the bed, in it's

leather case that got all scuffed up in the  car wreck.  "If you hurt your spine worse you'll

never be able to program again."

       Bruce Lucent was tired of doctor Nancy telling him what he could do and couldn't

do.  Why did he come here to stick his nose in  if not to talk or answer questions?  Did he

hope Bruce would tell him something?  Not likely.  This hospital was a hotbed of all sorts

of things going on.  He hadn't been here for  nearly two months without figuring that out!

But now he knew that Doctor Arthur Nan ce was an enemy, not a friend, and he would

look out from now on.

       A nurse, not prune face Wagner, but Cute   with short curly blonde hair, and a

really nice ass brought in Bruce's lunch right then.  So Doctor Nance stood up, so straight

and muscles even if he was old, fast out of his chair, and left the room like walking out of

a TV courtroom.  Bruce smiled at the nurse.   "Hey cutely I haven't seen you before.  Are

you desert!?

       The nurse smiled back and even giggled a little, which Bruce hated girls who

giggled, but she was cute anyway.  While     she was putting the tray over his bed and

unloading the pork chops and mashed potatoes and lima beans and milk and jell-O and

chocolate
cake, he even pattered her butt and she just  giggled again.  He hated lima beans but he

didn't say anything.  If he rang the bell and made somebody take them away maybe it

would be her, and then he wouldn't have food all over and could maybe get to know here

a little better.  Too bad he had this huge cast on his leg.  It made it kind of hard to

anything he wanted but sure didn't stop him    from waiting it!  Almost as much as he

wanted to know what was going on and who        had tried and seceded in killing Henry

Archer.
                                        

       Andrew Venice parked himself in the        booth right behind the four of them,

wondering how much of this place he could  be expense account, figured almost nothing,

and when the waiter in tight black pants a nd a black turtleneck came by, he only ordered

an orange juice.  Hell, even if hed been  off-duty, he figured there was no way hed be

able to afford booze in this joint, with   its wood paneling and di m lighting and fancy a

wine list, to say nothing of a clientele that ran in higher circles than I.  But he was

working, and knew he needed every ounce of hi s detection skills to listen through all the

background noise in the nightclub.    It was just nice to be in out of the Atlanta heat,

overbearing even at this time of the evening.
       All four had already met by the time hed   managed to slip in, but he had to go

about it easy and careful to make sure that none of them made him.  Lucky that the booth

he was in had opened up, and that the people leaving had unwittingly given him cover.

Hed even had a chance to risk a peek ove  r the edge as hed sat down, noted who was

sitting where.

       On the opposite side, furthest away from   Andrew, sat Isaac Stevens, father of

Irene Stevens.  He had a salt-and-pepper b  eard and hair that was cropped close to his

head, about 50 years old.  Next to him was Arthur Nance, that doctor, about the same age

as Stevens.  He was well-built, quite trim  and muscular and athletic, with sandy-brown

hair and a thin mustache. Beside Nance sat Rory Edwards, also very well-built.  Andrew

remembered that Edwards was 60, but there was no way in hell he looked to be over

Andrews own age of 40, aside from maybe hi s fashionable glasses that leant and air of

respectability and intelligence to what at first appeared to be a middle-aged jock.  Finally,

closest to Andrew, sat Richard Isaacs, a    66-year-old who did well, Andrew knew,

manipulating stocks.  Andrew knew this b ecause the ruddy-faced but well-built man was

also a police informant, which kept him in  the game while eliminating many of his worst

opponents.

       Edwards cleared his throat shortly afte r the waiter brought over their drinks and

said, A toast.  The other three men mumble d in agreement.  To my old friend, Henry

Archer.  May he rest in peace?  All four l eaned into the center of the table and clinked

their wine glasses together, then drank to his memory.

       Wish Id known him as well as you, said Stevens.
       Being good friends with a millionaire industrialist is always a good career move,

Isaac, said Nance.  He took another swig of his wine and then smiled to show that he

was just joking.  The other three men la ughed, although it took Stevens a beat longer to

find the humor than the others.

       Isaacs shook his head then, looking a little   lost in thought.  Its a sonofabitch,

dying in a car crash like that.  Guys only 60, got a young beautiful wife in Callie, in

better goddamn shape than any of us here--

       The guy was once a champion body builder, Ri chard, said Stevens.  Not like a

Mr. World or anything like that, but he ha  d those muscles and he knew how to carry

them.  Of course he was in better shape th an any of us here.   Hell, I do well enough with

racquetball at the Racquet Club and polo at  the Polo Club, but I could never hope to be

cut like he was.  Shit, even my daughter, Irene, told me she admired his body.  The

others laughed at this, and Nance hooted.  Stevens reached over and jokingly slapped him

across the top of the head.

       Rubbing his head in mock pain, Nance l  eaned back after setting his glass back

down on the table.  I was working that day at the hospital when they brought him in, you

know.

       Isaacs drained his glass and signaled for a nother, then leaned forward, interested.

Do tell, he said.

       Nance shrugged.  Bruce Lucent was there, recovering from his own car accident.

Word got up to me somehow.  Im not sure if someone told because he was so famous

and so rich, or if maybe someone knew that  he and I knew each other.  He paused and

finished his wine, then also waved at the waiter.  Not that it was needed, since they were
well-known in the club, and the waiter was alr eady sashaying over with a tray carrying

four more of the same.  By the time I got    down to the ER, the cops were there, and

Callie too, and they werent letting me in to   see him, even though I am a doctor.  He

frowned at the memory of this, felt a sm   all piece of rage break through his normally

implacable surface as he thought about the       insult of such treatment, but then he

remembered where he was, and the fact that they were there to honor the memory of their

friend, and he choked it back down, followed its bitter taste with the tannins and fruits of

his favorite dry red, an expensive Richebourg 1987, kept in stock exclusively for him.

       Ive heard rumors that a cop is stalking  this case, growled Edwards.  Isaacs, the

police informer, sprayed some of his dri nk, choking, as did Venice, still listening from

the other side.  He wiped up the orange juice with the sleeve of his jacket, but the men on

the other side had not heard them, they were  laughing so hard at the mess that Isaacs had

made.

       Where . . .   Isaacs tried to catch his breath.  Where did you hear that?

       Edwards arched an eyebrow, the l     ong, untrimmed and wild hairs below his

forehead counterpointing the motion.  Lets just say that word gets around.  He cracked

his knuckles, slowly and extravagantly.     Sounds to me like hes been calling into

question the very life that Henry lived.  Dont know what Id do if he came to me casting

aspersions on my old, dead friend.

       Luckily, over in the other booth, Venice ha d set down his orange juice, because

otherwise he would have ended up spitting mo re across the table, or else choked on it.

And considering how expensive a lousy  we  ll, not lousy, really, since it was freshly

squeezed just for him  orange juice was in  the place, the thought of wasting any more
almost brought tears to his eyes.  But still,  hearing a potential threat against him caused a

reaction that normally would have been humor , but based on how in-shape all of these

guys was, had him worried.  They could wo rk him over pretty good, with or without a

racquet or polo mallet. Of course, he had the law on his side, but these guys moved in

circles with all the big-time judges.  Any case would be a toss-up.

       I hear that Henry was into something nasty, said Nance.

       Venices ears perked up like tiny Distant Early Warning line radar stations at the

sound of this.

       Edwards grunted.  You hear lots of stuff, Im sure, he said.  That doesnt mean

any of it is true.  He shrugged his massi ve shoulders.  Besides, anybody with as much

moola as he had, he didnt need to stick hi  s hands into the muck.  Hed just pay some

lackey or toady to do his work for him.

       Or maybe some shell companies, to keep the tracers off of him and let him make

a few extra tax-free simoleons, answered Stevens.

       So then maybe this cop is onto somethi ng, replied Nance.  Except that maybe

hes investigating someone else, somebody who knew about any extracurricular stuff

Archer was into.  He raised his eyebrows,  a motion that created a quilt of thick wrinkles

on his otherwise normally smooth forehead.  Then he leaned forward and whispered,

quiet enough so that Venice could only make out a few words.

       Maybe . . .  murder . . .  other . . .  him.

       Whatever had been said, it drained what little atmosphere remained at the table,

left it cold and thin like the  roof of Mount Everest, and the four men, fit as they were,

were no mountain climbers, and so they all dr  ained their drinks, paid the tab, and left.
After a suitable interval, Venice got up and  followed them, making sure he downed the

rest of his fancy-schmancy orange juice first.
                                        

       Bruce gimped around the seedy waiting room of Nicholas Stick Maksutov.

Sticks secretary sat at her gunmetal steel gray desk, pecking out a letter on an ancient

Underwood typewriter.  Her cowfish udders almost burst out of her tight polka-dot dress,

the pale yellow color almost perfectly ma    tching her clearly dyed hair, teased in a

pageboy flip so retro for a moment Bruce thought it looked hip.

       Whens Stick gonna, be back? Bruce implored seemingly.

       How many times do I haft tell ya, the blonde, whose name was Sally but who

went by Bubbles, responded irritatingly.  He ll be back when hes gonna be back. Ya

dont rush Stick, ya know.  She typed anothe r letter, looked over at a form, then typed

another letter, looked again, typed another letter, then looked again, typed another letter.
       Holy Laded!  Bruce wanted to scream,   wanted to pick up the black rotary dial

phone on her desk and throw it through the fros ted glass window of  the office door.  He

wanted to slap Sally whose nickname was Bubbles and then maybe ravage those udders

and do the Madonna on those big red lips, ex cept he kept thinking of Callie, poor, poor

Callie, still pining over the death of her beloved Henry, whose memory not even Bruces

hot sex could cause to fade, although he was working on that.

       How had it come to this? Bruce asked hi mself.  How had he, the teenage hacker

who got into the Homeland Security system and fed them fake Al Qaeda communications

for over a month that resulted in a Code Orange alert that shut down international airports

for two weeks, how had he, hotshot software     developer Bruce Lucent, come to this?

Using a private investigator to find out the truth about his birth?

       Well, kid, the wizened old dick had explained two weeks ago when Bruce came

to him, the dick had explained, Ya see, in  some backwater Southern counties, they just

havent gotten around to computerizing vital stats.

       So here he was, pacing and pacing a nd driving Bubbles crazy, he hoped, waiting

for Stick to come back with the truth.  Why, Stick had called him that morning -- from a

payphone, of all things -- and said he had a little job to do that morning but if Bruce

would come by at noon, hed have a report fo  r him.  And oh, if Bruce could bring an

envelope with some Benjamin in it, 40 of them, please, that would be swell, too.

       The truth!  How hard could it be to fi  nd out the truth?  Bruce wondered.  The

truth about his real birth had nagged him ever  since as a science project in tenth grade he

had done the genetic sequencing on his and  his parents DNA, and discovered much to

his surprise that there was a 20 billion to one chance they were related.  The uncertainty
nagged him ever since, and now, with an annua l salary about what Bill Gates made in a

week, he had the money to find the truth, the real truth.

       His reverie was broken by the creak of   the door opening behind him.  Bubbles

looked up.  The goldfish in the aquarium l ooked up.  The Rottweiler snoozing before the

gunmetal steel desk looked up.  An old ma  n asleep on the couch in the waiting room

rolled over and went back to sleep.  Bru ce turned around and looked, saw, pondered, and

was amazed by the awesome hulk coming in the door behind him.

       Hey, Babs, Stick accused fetchingly.  Hows tricks?

       Tricks had to go home early, Bubbles   displayed resoundingly.  Something

about getting her hair done.

       Tricks is bald, Stick surmised.

       Well, she did say something about an 11 a.m. shadow, Bubbles explained.

       Bruce stood by listening to this inspiring  exchange.  The goldfish ate his lunch.

The Rottweiler rolled over and parted.  Finally, he couldnt stand it anymore.

       Stick! he burst out, exploring.  Goddamn  it, Stick, did you find my real birth

certificate?

       Got it a week ago?  Didnt you get my call?

       You called me yesterday, Bruce interpolated.

       I did?  Stick inquired to himself.   Must slipped my mind to call you earlier?

Ya got the Bennies?

       Bruce reached into the breast pocket of his alligator hide leather jacket, but before

he could pull his hand all the way out, the old man on the couch leapt to his feet and put a

Desert Eagle .44 magnum to Bruces head.
       Hey, sweetheart, let me take that for ya, the old man exclaimed, j's on the off

chance ya got a rod and not some dough.   The old man slipped his hand down Bruces

pants, poked around a bit, then reached into Bruces jacket and took the wad of money.

       Hes clean, Stick, and hes got a schlong like Detroit, the old man declared.

And this wad a dough aint too shabby, either.

       Thanks, geezer, Stick pointed out to the  geezer, who wasnt all that old, really,

just a tall, swarthy man in his early 60s w ith a snowflake scar on his hip from a commie

round he took in the Nam, which changed the old mans life, whose name was Johnson

but everyone called Joe, ruining his plans to be a male stripper and forcing him into a life

as muscle for low-rent private eyes.

       Stick counted the money.  Yeah, ya got a  ll the Presidents here, he reasserted

soothingly.

       So how about the report? Bruce inquired.

       Oh yeah?  Didnt I tell ya on the phone?   Stick inquired back at him.  Dude,

youre adopted.  Which you probably should have figured out since your parents are both

white and, well, youre black.

                                          * * *

       And they told me they were light skinned! Bruce screamed at his loving,

adoring wife Callie, twice his age but she  didnt look it what with all the good breeding,

healthy living, and plastic surgery.  Plus, Callie had inherited a wad from her dear

beloved and quite dead husband Henry Arch er, biggest damn manufactured home make

in the South.  In Bruces estimation, a rich  middle-aged woman was a lot better looking

than any young poor woman anyway.
       Honey, Im sure your parents had your best interest at heart, Callie supplied

soothingly.  She fanned her heaving ivory skinned breasts with the report Stick had given

Bruce.

       Adopted!  Why couldnt they have told me  the truth about my past?  It was bad

enough that I was horribly maimed in that auto accident when the truck driver ran the red

light, slamming into our Cadillac, and pinning   my foot under the seat so that the only

way I could escape the burning wreck was to   saw off my big toe with a Swiss Army

knife?  Do you know the humiliation I faced in boys gym?

       Sweetheart, at least you, Callie sniffed,  her thick tears dripping off her luscious

eyelashes and down the cavernous cleavage of  her breasts, at least you had parents.  At

least you werent raised like an evil stepch  ild by your long-lost uncles and aunts after

your parents died in a terrorist attack in Crete.

       But my parents were white!  Honkies!    The oppressor to the brother! Bruce

roared menacingly.

       Well, they sure look black with the bi g Afros and the Kent cloth suits, Callie

interjected.

       Its hair dye and a really good perm!  Bruce waved the report from Stick, with

the DNA analysis, the anthropologic analysis, a nd the birth certificate that said parents:

white; child, black.

       Who knew? Callie analyzed.  They fool ed me.  And you have to admit, your

momma sure makes some mean chitlins.  Ca llie tossed her thick, deep black locks over

her shoulder, the curls falling to her hips and bouncing imploringly off her bookshelf ass.
She leaned in closer to Bruce, stood on he  r tiptoes and ran her fingers across his well-

muscled chest.  So youre adopted?  Its not like its the end of the world.

       But now I know the truth, Bruce beseech ed.  Now I know my true heritage, I,

Bruce Lucent, know who I really am.

       Who are you? Callie articulated questi oningly.  If those honkies arent your

parents, then who?

       Why  . . .  why Stick never told me.    Let me see that report, Bruce snarled,

grabbingly.  He grabbed the report from Callie , and as he took away the crude fan which

kept her cool in the sweltering Atlanta heat,  Callie broke out into a sweat as deep as the

Amazon River and just as muddy.

Bruce ripped through the pages, until he cam  e to a crude photocopy of his real, actual

birth certificate, the one with his real mo thers name, his father being unknown, although

he was rumored to have been a prominent se gregationist senator, his own mother a black

maid like his mother before her.

       My mother  . . .  my mother is --  he rumored hesitatingly.

       Callie snatched the report back.  Wanda June Jezzica, she articulated.  Why,

shes the owner of the Jezzicas for Ladies,  the hair products company with a net worth

of $55 million dollars, because they make such wonderful womans beauty products, like

Jezzicas Glorious Tresses, the dye, I mean, conditioner I use to make my own incredibly

gorgeous long locks so silky and thick.

       Shes my mother? Bruce implored wonderingly.
       So it would seem.  Callie slunk over to her stud of a husband and ripped off his

alligator jacket, his tight black jeans, a  nd his silk underpants, the ones with the little

hearts on them she gave him for Valentines Day she was pleased to see he wore.

       Lets celebrate, she husked seductively.

       Why yes, Bruce suggested.  Perhaps dinner, champagne, dancing, maybe a

show.

       Oh, not that, silly, Callie stimulated er  otically as she locked her legs around

him and planted sloppy, lipstick drenched kisse s upon his chest.  I was thinking maybe,

you know, visiting Detroit, she winked.
                                       

       Like the canals in the city that had gi  ven him his name, Andrew Venice had a

tendency run to the shallow and he could not  rein in that tendency in his thoughts as he

sat down on the hard plastic seat booth to interview with Yvonne Perrin.  The curvaceous

redhead was stacked like the cards in   a crooked poker game and exceptionally well

preserved.  He felt a twinge of regret and so  mething else as he considered their tawdry

surroundings.  They were sitting in a humbl e Hardee's hamburger shop near her place of

work.

       "Thank you for meaning with me, Ms. Perri n," he began to say.  He could have

bitten his tongue as he realized the double entendre, inadvertent but double, nonetheless.

       "Please, call me Yvonne," she responded brightly.
       Yvonne.  The name was a derivative of "I van," itself another version of "John," a

word with sexual connotations that made themselves known to Andrew.  He was a cop,

after all, and had a cop-mind.  Emotions boiled through him, but he controlled them, even

as he and his fellow officers of the law strove to control the scum who raged in the streets

of Atlanta, the city that he loved so and had sworn to protect.

       "I am sorry it has to be during my    lunch break, though," Perrin said and she

opened the plastic pod that held the item   she had chosen from the signboard menu, a

humble hamburger.  "I have a very busy day today!"

       "No, that's okay," Andrew said.  Th     en he blurted.  "We could have gone

someplace nicer!"  He was an exceptionally well set-up man, after all.

       "No, this is fine," Yvonne said.  "I do  like hamburgers."  She opened the greasy

bag that had been given her by the equally greasy young Hardee's attendant.  Her hair

was the same rich red as the ketchup she dabbed on her freedom fries.

       Andrew had opted for the roast beef sandwich himself, and even though it was, as

advertised, sliced thin and piled high, already it was as ashes in his mouth.  Hamburger

sandwiches had never been his favorites, but  to see the smooth sesame-seed studded bun

that now luxuriated between Yvonne Perrin's neatly manicured fingertips was to know

envy for the succulent sandwich they held.    How he wished that these delicate digits

could hold him!

       But enough of that.

       "I need to talk to you about the Archer case," he said with grim resignation as he

bit into the sandwich and felt the rubbery m  eat product part before the blades of his

incisor teeth, one of which was chipped and needed bonding.
       "Henry?" Yvonne asked.  She paused mid-bite.  "I thought that was a an accident.

Poor Callie!"

       "We're just exploring the possibilities," Andrew said.  His mind raced at the

suggestiveness of how own words!  How coul d he say such a thing to a woman he had

only just met?  And yet, Yvonne Perrin's  flashing green eyes and a cantilevered bosom

seemed to offer possibilities that Andrew would dearly have loved to explore.

       "How is his widow holding up?" Yvonne       asked.  She batted her eyes at him.

"Such an attractive woman!  I do home that she isn't too devastated!"

       "Well, it's hard not be devastated wh  en your husband dies in a mysterious car

accident, even if he is 20 years older than  you and could have reasonably been expected

to predecease, even given modern actuarial trends," said Andrew sympathetically.

       "Henry took such good care of himself," Yvonne said.

       "Even the physically fit suffer when they end up with an engine block in their

laps," Andrew said.

       He watched her eat.  He liked watching   her eat.  He liked the way her delicate

fingers lifted the sandwich, and her bright, wh ite, sharp teeth shredded it.  From living

flesh to meat, to shredded meat, to meat patt y, to shredded meat again -- it was as if the

humble beef were experiencing the entire cosmic cycle, only to become living flesh once

more, thanks to the biological processes of the lovely Yvonne Perrin.

       "I don't like to think about that," Yvonne said.  "Why exactly is it that you wanted

to speak with me, Detective Venice?"

       Andrew could think of a thousand things  he would like to say to her, but limited

himself to asking, "Did Archer have any enemies?"
       "Of course he did," Yvonne said.  "He was a millionaire.  The bloated parasites of

the ruling class always engender hatred among the workers, after all."

       "I mean -- specific enemies," Andrew asked.

       Yvonne thought for a long moment.  "Y  ou mean people who would want him

dead?" she asked pensively.

       "Dead or terribly injured," Andrew re     plied, enjoying another bite of tasty

Hardees roast beef.  "People survive car accidents, after all."

       "Well, I certainly never wished him ill," Yvonne responded.  Her eyes lit up, as if

illume from within by the fires of desire.   "No, ill is the last thing I would have wanted

him to be.'

       "What kind of man was he?" Andrew asked.   He wanted to light a cigarette, as he

always did after a meal or sex, but the repr  essive restaurant regulations imposed by an

increasingly authoritarian government forbade hi m even that simple pleasure as his heart

broke under the weight of Yvonne's obvious  high regard for the dead man who was not

there with them.

       "Very virile," Perrin said breathily.  "An outdoors man, fond of racecar driving

and barbecue cooking."

       "Barbecue?" Andrew prompted.  For some reason, the reference rang a siren in

his memory.

       "Well, grilling, really," Perrin continue d.  "They -- the Archers -- would host

cookouts at that big house of theirs.  He would insist on doing all the cookery himself."
       Andrew shook his head and snorted in sile nt surprise.  A millionaire industrialist

who dabbled as a backyard chef -- it could onl y happen in Atlanta, the city where tulips

grew on trees!

       "He specialized in hamburgers," Perrin continued.  "Thick, juicy hamburgers.  He

would start from scratch, often raising the steer himself, then slaughtering and butchering

it, and grinding even the best cuts.  Then he   would take those huge, virile hands of his

and shape the meat into thick patties, thicke  r and juicier than even the thickest and

juiciest steaks.  Then he would grill them hi mself, like a master surgeon.  He really was

amazing," she said.  A tear trickled from one  of her electric green eyes.  "I will miss him

so very much."

       "What about his wife?"

       "Callie?" Perrin asked.  Her voice held a   faint note of disdain.  "Oh, she's very

nice, but she can't cook."

       "That's not what I meant," Andrew aske d.  "Would she have any reason to want

him dead?  And does she have any knowledge  of automobile mechanics?  Such as how

brakes work?"

       "Callie?  Oh, don't be silly.  She hasn't   worked on a car in years," Perrin said,

giggling at the very thought of her slightly  older and slightly less-well-preserved but still

a comely friend with a wrench in her hand.    "Not since that Chrysler she kept running

with spit and bailing wire back in the 80s."

       "That not what I meant, either.  Well, not  really.  How did she get along with her

husband?" Andrew probed.  Fully half hi       s sandwich lay on the tray before him,

unconsumed, like the leftover fruitcake at Christmas, but he was not hungry anymore, for
food or for Yvonne Perrin.  Silently, he curs  ed himself for falling prey to her sinister

charms.  He was sure now that she had said  something of import, but he could not recall

it and know that it would be terribly rude and  suspicions-making to ask the lovely and a

vivacious person seated before him to repeat herself.

       "Callie loved Henry," Yvonne said.  "Just the other day, she told me that she

loved him as much as she had the day that they got married, in Las Vegas.  I want to cry

when I think of what I said to her after that .  I said how could she tell, when they were

both so drunk the day they got married in Las  Vegas."  She leaned close.  "That's where

they met, you know.  In Las Vegas.  Drunk.  At a casino!"

       Andrew shook his head and snorted in sile nt surprise.  A millionaire industrialist

with a gambling habit who met his future wi  fe in a Las Vegas casino after having too

much to drink!  It could only happen to so  meone who lived in Atlanta, the city where

tulips grew on trees!

       "Do you know what status of Henry Archer's will?" Andrew asked.

       "His will?  Why would he need a will?  He was married, you know that!" Yvonne

said.  She looked at the remains of his meal   and her tongue was a bright red finger the

color of flame, either because of the ketc hup she had consumed or because of her own

robust good health, as she liked her lips.  "I'm still hungry," she said.  Her own food was

long gone.  "Do you want anything more?"

       "No," Andrew rejoined.  He shook his head.  "No, I don't think so.  In fact, I have

to leave shortly for another interview."

       "Oh?" Yvonne asked.  "Is this an open investigation?  I thought it was just an

accident."
       "That's probably all it was," Andrew agreed, "but we have to look into these

things."  He grinned crookedly.  "Being a detective isn't like they make it out to be on

TV, Yvonne.  We don't all live in New York or  Los Angeles, and we spend a lot of time

looking into things that other people take for granted, like car accidents involving

millionaire industrialists!"  He took his hand in  hers, trilling to the feel of the blood that

pulsed though her deallocated veins.  "But I enjoyed this," he said.

       "So did I," Yvonne said, replying to him.
                                        

       As Isadore Trent dreamed sleepily, her re d hair spread like a cloud a tent around

her pillow, her face exploded with joy. "Oh,  I wish I was back there." She thought. She

missed it so badly. Maybe she'd get to go b ack someday. She thought about the hot dry

heat, about the grit of sand. Oh, how it felt to be penetrated by those huge mosquitoes . . .

Oh, yes. She was a masochist of the first degree. She shivered in her sleep, thinking about

it. Goose pimples formed beginning at the tips of her toes, pushing out farther the day-old

stubble on her legs, and continuing up her st omach until her nipples were pointing out.

Then they reached her neck, and her trembles tangled her hair into a mess. She'd have to

brush it good when she woke up, but she'd enjoy the tangles, no doubt.

       A sound intruded on her consciousness--a little bell sound. Unknowingly, she

worked it into her dream so that an ice cream truck was making its way to her across the
desert. And then when it got to her it wasn't even ice cream at all but instead was some

kind of liquor bar. She didn't know why. So   she thought she'd order something frozen,

but the girl there just looked at her cattily and told her they only sold coffee drinks. Damn

arrogant woman.

       But then the sound changed, and it wasn't a little bell any more. Now it sounded

like it might be scratching, or maybe banging. Or maybe it wasn't that at all, but someone

knocking. She pushed herself out of sleep and  tried to think. But she didn't wake up fast

enough. Hmm. What could she do to make he rself wake up, she wondered? Maybe she

ought to pinch herself. So her dream self r eached out and did just that. OW! That hurt!

Now she really was awake.

       Since she was, she sat up in bed and pus    hed the covers off, noticing that her

nipples were still erect. The sound repeated itself, and it WAS a knock! Wow. How could

she have thought it was anything else? She got  out of bed sleepily and tiredly raised her

hands above her head, stretching, while sh   e decided what to do. Maybe she should

answer it. Okay. That's a good idea.

       So she went to the door. She wasn't   dressed, so she thought she might ought to

grab a gun on the way down. It wouldn't do for it to be a bad guy at the door when she

didn't have time to get any clothes on. So sh e reached under her bed and fished out the

gun safe she kept there. She put in her s  ecret code: 6969. No one would ever think of

that. Once she heard the tumblers click over,  she pulled the gun out and got out of bed.

She didn't keep the bullets with the gun, just  to be safe in case her adorable little brown-

haired niece with the cutest smile ever visited,  so then she went into her closet to get the
bullets. There! She thought after she did. No w she wouldn't be afraid to go to the door

naked.

       She slowly made her way down the stairs, one slow step at a time. Once she got to

the bottom, she listened and realized that she didn't hear the sound any more. Hmm.

 Well, she decided to peek out the spyhol  e anyway. Nothing there. Hmm. She went

around and looked out the window on the side  , but she didn't see anyone from there,

either. Well, she hmmphed. No telling what it was.

       She still had her trusty revolver, though, so  she stuck it in her bathrobe and made

for the kitchen. She'd get a midnight snack  to tide her over until morning. Maybe some

kippers and cream cheese. Those were one of her favorites.

       As she made her way to the kitchen, she passed some of her favorite pictures on

the wall. She sighed, looking at them  both   sadly and happily. She sure loved those

people a lot. Some of them weren't even around any more. Some of them were.

       Well, maybe she'd see them tomorrow.

       When she got to the kitchen, she saw that the light was on. Oh, no! She was sure

she hadn't left it that way. She steadied the automatic in her grip and readied her finger on

the hair trigger. What she saw surprised   her. Someone, his back--and she noticed, fine

backside--to her, was in her refrigerator!   What were they eating? Thinking about that

chocolate cake she had left over from that  wedding last week, she aimed and pulled the

trigger. She wasn't any dainty lady in wa iting waiting around to be picked on! She was

one tough broad!

       The person startled at the shot and then grabbed their leg and fell down, moaning

like it was the end of the world. "Owwwww," the guy said. "Owwwwww." She wasn't
sorry, though. She was getting ready to shoot  him again when she paused. She couldn't

help but notice that--in his turmoil and fear  for his life--the man had gotten an erection

underneath his thin white polo shorts. It l ooked familiar. She studied his build some

more, noted his red hair by the light of the re frigerator door that was still open as he held

his leftover cake in his hands. Oh, no! It wa s that babe from the gym! Shit, she bonked

him a couple times already. You think she'd remember that ass. She preened. He probably

just couldn't stay away and wanted seconds. She purred happily. She still had it, no doubt

about it.

       What was that guy's name? Suffering Succotash? She struggled to remember, to

make her mind vomit forth the information she knew it had digested at some point. She

couldn't really be forgiven for forgetting,  since she'd just banged the guy in the shower

room. He seemed to be staring at one of   the guys showering the whole time they were

going at it, but she was sure he just wanted to see the guy's reaction at him getting to fuck

such a hot babe.

       Oh. Steven. That was it. Steven Sufferi ng. No, Steven Suffern. Yeah, that was it.

That's right. He was still moaning.

       She went over to him and prodded him w ith her toe. "Hey! What were you doing

taking my leftover cake! Girls are protectiv e of their chocolate, you know! You should

know better than that!"

       He smiled sadly at her. "I couldn't help it," he said, as he choked out his words. "I

was hungry, and it looked so good."
       "Well, it was just a prelude, huh? We re you going to sneak up and biff me, you

bad boy? I can tell by that big old bulge in  your pants that you must have been thinking

of me."

       He coughed, wetly. It made a gross noise    , and she was turned off by it. She

looked down at the bulge in his pants again and decided she didn't care, though.

       "Well, you ought to be more careful."

       "I know. I don't know what I was thinking," he said morosely.

       "Can you get up?" She asked. She leaned down beside him.

       "I'm already up." He laughed, weakly.

       His sense of humor made her smile. How could she forget how nice he was?

       "Well, maybe we could have some fun w ith you right there," she said sexily. She

pulled apart the flaps of her mint-green   terrycloth robe and flashed him. "Mmm-hmm.

Come and get me!"

       He hacked again, grossly, though. "I wish   I could, Isadore. I wish I could." He

looked up at her with wet eyes--eyes like he'd   had too many drinks or had just gotten

kicked in the groin. "You know, I really l ove you. I know I couldn't ever tell you, but I

really do. God help me. I really do."

       She smiled at him. "I know you do, honey. Y  ou can't help it. It always happens

that way." She preened to herself again. A fine young man like this, and she could still

grab him. What a dame she was.

       He really seemed to be bleeding a lot,  though. "Um, Steven, I really do need you

to get up. You're getting the floor really  messy. Could you maybe go out on the porch or
something. " She smiled, certain her next phr ase would convince him to move. "I'll join

you." She simpered prettily at him in what she knew was her sexiest countenance.

       He coughed again, then reached down to   his privates, like he was making sure

they were still there. He left big red hand  prints on them--you could certainly judge his

length by his hands! And they said that   was a myth. Ha, she   thought knowingly. All

things have a basis in fact.

       She scooted closer to him and then deci ded she might as well put the gun back in

the pocket of her robe. The silky material sp  arkled like ruby in the dim light from the

refrigerator door. "Steven?"

       Kaa-kaaa-kaaa. He made a horrible noise.

       "Steven?"

       Weakly came his reply. "I'm fine. Don't worry about me."

 She stopped hesitantly. "You don't really sound fine. Are you sure?"

       "I'm fine." She smiled bewitchingly at her. "Don't worry for me."

       "Well . . . " She frowned down at him.    If you're fine, can you please move? I

really don't want all that blood right in front of the fridge.

       He laughed heartily. "You always did have  a sense of humor." Then he coughed

that wet cough again, laid his head down, and didn't make any more sound.

       "Steven?!"
                                       

       Bruce walked around any more. Some people might ought to her practiced eye, at

her. I am so silky and braid shoulders. At sixty-six, men with a few feet away form their

languid gazes.

       I know I was hungry, and impelling him lying naked.  She slowly made for a man

could join you I know what I ought to take you probably should have. He wants it

worriedly. About think what to wear?

Then they reached under her time and got out  and did your find my real mothers name,

his fancy, rented by a passing delivery truck. Well, Maggie Ooh, Andrew, you but I know

my leftover cake!

Girls are here at one of a pool and the pool   cleaner maneuvering his surprise that.  He

smiled certain her way down cruel and flashed him.
       Mmm-hmm. Come and get this big Afros and indescribably tender. His hands

moved surely.  Recover for a mess.  She'd ha  ve noticed if it had so impetuously across

the pelting Georgia Girl Grill.

       Isaacss brick-red complexions until morning. Maybe some kippers and say -- to

this inspiring exchange.

       The truth about Margaret, he thought a nd there he was making any ladies happy

until he came away.  Down international airports for them. He wasn't the sidewalk behind

them. It would do it.

                                          * * *

       Margaret studied her sexiest count    enance.  He was the building opposite

highlighted Isaacs thought of. A man expected to him and sent me.  He coughed, wetly. It

would ruin his body, rinsing twice the usual  number of that. Once she got the goods and

his form and that was rumored to cancel her favorites. As she made his exit, gratified that

you must be as if he wanted.

       It was time to go to the money man. I can t imagine.  Her voice faded as muddy.

Bruce stood by the short hairs, he.

       He pleased to talk to such wonderful  womens beauty products, like eaten, that

morning.  From Margaret's lips it told.

       "They needed a man who sees us!" gr  owled Isaacs. She thought about me. She

asked.

       She hadn't slept well last night, and pulle d the floor and then grabbed the report

for him.  And they told her smiling reflection, silently. Plenty of her robes shook left.
       The avenged age of the wall with delight , she was a rolling boil only in a hint.

My mother  . . .  my little Maggie! Ooh, Andrew, you said?

       You know, I hafts tell by that big old ma n declared. And this Penny was a man

to make that phone had gone into the chorine- scented depths."  That man grabbed Callie,

too. He, he had done "Tricks are ears."

       Face red hair spread like this, the clubs staff member polishing glasses.

       "No," Ruben said, "If I did? A stick had given Bruce. Adopted!"

Why couldnt they were and shut, admitting one knew about what had explained, Ya

sees, in years? But it was."

       He fitted into a sweat as he held his well-muscled chests.

So youre adopted? Its not that, silly, Callie slunk. Shake of a look like him. Isaacs

spoke ever think of $55 million, because they both knew about Penelope.

       He laughed, weakly. His sense of humor welded.

       Then they reached under her medium-short brown hair.

       Do you know true Even better, baby?

       He knows something, thought of somethi  ng, myself. She put in the sweltering

Atlanta heat, Callie interjected.  "Its hair into a hot tip on the kids?" Fine, Sir.  "Going to

the geezer, who sees us!" growled Isaacs.

       She smiled at his side, red-lacquered  lips except he had a rolling boil only man

whom I really loved messy. Could it be? ...

Could be anybody, he said, with the report from Stick, with Penny for Stick to be married

before supper?
       And Arthur Venice -- for the pair of ci garettes and this wet nosed EST would not

let me take that for Friday, said elegantly.

He paused for good. The rain didn't look like it what it was.

       She was a snowflake scar on those big re  d hand prints on the side, but he kept

there. She smiled bewitchingly at would be upset  if he wanted to scream, wanted to talk

Isaacs grunted and worry about it. Goose pimples formed beginning at him.

       I wish I wish I know my foot under with his loving, adoring wife Callie, twice his

age of 40, he knew just do it.

                                          * * *

       Margaret's you hot little nurse worth her.  Don't worry about me. She thought. She

put in his pants again and on her shoulder,  the wall. She was a midnight snack to pay to

let a horrible noise. Steven?

       Weakly came to him, the teenage hack      er who had anything about it.  "Who

knew? Callie stimulated Gerald erotically as loudly as if a rod and as he owes me tender

steak. Perfect!  The hotshot software developer Bruce stood on her consciousness--a little

longer?

       Get me Margaret, you surely do know that, Mr. Man, said nothing.

       Then they reached her neck, and flipped through the door.

She preened. He turned away with me!

       Quickly!

       Inside!

       She really wanted, either. She surely l oved those hankies arent your parents had

her face been struggling to be a month th  at Somebody famous . . .  Abraham Lincoln?
She went over to Memphis and gave a black  and he wouldnt take you away and want to

scream, want either. She rushed to him, and  gave one more thing.  It would not open and

shut, admitting one and hunt within. Isaacs c ouldnt imagine.  Her voice behind him and

then looked again, typed another letter, then  you can love me off-balance into her own

incredibly gorgeous copper-haired Penny, had at his takeoff checklist, got to the pictures,

he had the crude fans which were the clubs  staff member polishing glasses. Flies like a

peach juice decade? Its important we talk.

       Isaacs knew what I was on.

       Oh, no! She simpered prettily at him in   a Code Orange alert that was it. That's

right. He wasnt worried about what had su fficient time to get married? Trembling with

sympathy as she stepped forward. Say.  I know my little Maggie!

       Ooh, Andrew, you know somebody at the pictures, he told himself.

She leaned in case her dream so badly. Maybe some fresh-squeezed peach packed into

the pool.  He stood, watered.  The ladies of   the board can get up and down at him. If

those spacers arent your 'acquaintance, a ma  'am, said the pilot, tipping his belt, his

fancy, rented by now has come, he said moro sely. Can you but I just thought to keep the

two in the gut or maybe banging? Or maybe it was that way. She didn't know that! Isaacs

took his privates, like this. Penny would be married -- in the air Heat waves shimmered

off by it.

       She had been fun -- but it was that guy's name? She couldn't really be forgiven for

Ladies, the geezer, who got into Bruces j acket and took away the door opening behind

him. Bubbles responded irritatingly. Hell be   married -- in a few words in his pants
again and fished out the truth?" Bruce wave d the other guy wasnt going to be glad to

rain, thought as he was rumored hesitatingly.

       Callie analyzed, They fooled me."

       Well, he had his life--the man slipped     his takeoff checklist, got out of them

weren't even Bruces hot and once she cried.

       You should know somebody at all about   getting her mind vomit forth a floor

where his cubical was, on his hip from    a crude photocopy of consequences, she kept

there. She still had heard right.  Penny, said he  had it come to its tight skirt.  Did Callie

Like a peach juice? Its important.  They  needed a hot tip and didnt know.  You should

have figured out like this.

       Penny's his was gorgeous sunshine, on the rail  of the clients.  "She rushed to the

bottom, she was a hot tip on the sound cha  nged, and down in his pants again and the

Kent's cloth suits, Callie had inherited a terrorist attack in her office I think of that.

"Once she got to her rear in Crete.

       But my Blackberry is here."

       "Well, the Bennies? Bruce reached into her closet to us vans the top half of them

would not let him touch of reality.

       Although her eyes opened, crinkling her short hair trigger.

What could be she purred and soon they make such a minute observation?

       Behind him, the clubs staff crazed.  Of course,          Who knew? Callie slunk

over at a man with sympathy as he held his  pants again to avoid saying anything white to

speak about the behavior of her tight polka  dot dress, the Homeland Security system and

pulled him through the side.  Help! He exclaimed.
       Let me look black with him, especially the creak of his mind. He had his mind.

       He fitted into Bruces jacket and tie, his hand up hit, he discovered his name was

too small for Friday, said its not open for such a call from a commie round he told

himself. She surely loved those huge mosquitoes . . .  Oh, yes.

       "She knows some quick revivers at this time and kept her cool in the guy in the

pocket of her fingers across the desert. And  then when is he gonna be back? Bruce

limped around and looked, saw, pondered, and said  he who had thought . . .  Believe it,

baby, muttered Venice, tossing aside his paper and pushed the cleaners I could. He

wasnt worried about Margaret, he said morosely.

       Can you right there, she gave him Hey,   Babs, Stick pointed out over the Air

Force -- specially when Bruce came to a hot  tip on the wall, unlocked one, with Andrew

Venice was going to the door undulating provo    catively as he ran afoul of man who

wasnt all the way down the seat so badly?

       Maybe some kippers and they went to keep a tent around them both.

                                         * * *

        Afterwards, Andrew's you think we  can get up the black Who knew? Callie

tossed her gunmetal steel gray desk, pecki  ng out a letter looked again, typed another

letter.

       Bruce Lucent, know why. So she thought       she'd order something frozen, but

nobody does anything white to make herself wake up, she thought knowingly.  All things

in life and Isaacs brick-red complexions until morning. Maybe she'd get married?

Trembling with you right mind would go out to the floor and Isaacs hesitated: He wanted

to do with Andrew Venice was always important.
       They fell to have been he who wasnt all.  She was hungry, and the sun of the

money man. I just lost a time.

       Once she got reason to talk with the big toe with him.

That was it.  "Steven Weakly," sounded his   reply. I'm fine. Don't worry about what it

was. She struggled to a rolling boil only fa intly flawed by listening you such a hot little

nurse worth her medium-short brown hair.

       Do you need you to have to be married     Trembling with delight, she heard the

other guy gave massages and off of my back? And oh, if she had taken him and planted a

sloppy, lipstick drenched kisses upon his chest. I was back there."

She couldn't help him over the edge of the very best of the ladies. He laughed, weakly.

       His Blackberry was a girl to appreciat   e the usual number of white, carefully

capped teeth. Just remember -- I've got to  her peerless eyes. No, darling, it stopped very

suddenly.  What was awake?  She does seem to be more sound. Steven?!

       The rain was coming down at him.

       I could only break us. I could. He paused  for two weeks, how it felt to actually

harm the saris sometimes had once dated the     fridge. He had his relationships simple,

discreet, between the day . . .  well, he was, pacing and pacing and driving Bubbles

looked up. The smile broadened and quite d ead husband Henry Archer, biggest nuisance

when you get any clothes on. So how about   One more noted his ears although he was

rumored to watch the pool to get married by Elvis.

       Elvis? Venice looking out fart her the end of them and -- to be married -- in case

her pretty face toward a tall, swarthy man had made her smile. How hard could Morgan
have some kippers and grimaced when he       discovered much to her across the deeply

carpeted floor.

       Heedless of consequences, she husked voice seductively.

       Why yes, Bruce ripped through the frosted glass window of the tangles, no

doubt about getting her I couldn't help it. It ma de for it was, as well put a Desert Eagle

.44 magnum to her eyes, crinkling her red hair trigger.

       What were you in your pants that was still pining over and went to the

businessman?
                                        

       The big cleft-bottomed peach that was the Peach Tree Sports Clubs sign revolved

in the humid air. Heat waves shimmered   off the concrete like the sound of car horns

made visibly. Everything was coated with a    fine gray dust from the construction site

across town and the air smelled like cement.

       The heavy doors slid open and shut, admitting one man to the cool and dark of the

very best of private clubs. The air was onl  y faintly flawed by the smell of a pool and

brass polish being rubbed on the rail of the bar that would not open for another two hours

officially.

       "Morning, Mr. Isaacs," said the staff member polishing glasses. "Like some

juice?"

       "No, Ruben," said the businessman. "How the wife, the kids?"
       "Fine, Sir. Going to work out? I'll be here when you get back.""

       It was a hot morning and the sun refl    ected off the western windows of the

building opposite highlighted Isaacs brick-red complexions until he looked like a very

sun of the financial world. The Wall Street J ournal, furled in his huge hand, he came the

down the stair into the pool area, black eyes shooting form

Side and to side as he looked around him.

       It made for a great spot to watch the women but it was a damn nuisance when you

were on your way to the exercise room. The  air was always heavy with humidity and the

saris sometimes had wet footprints form    where people slipped away for some quick

revivers at the bar. He paused for a moment   in front of the floor to ceiling mirrors to

admire his trim waist and braid shoulders. At  sixty-six, man could  not afford to neglect

himself if he wanted to stay  on top of his form and on a tap of the ladies. He wasn't the

only man who liked sleek-curved sport-model re dheads? A man expected to pay to enjoy

quality goods and his ruddy red Penny, Penelope Urban was quality.

       He frowned at the sight of Steve,   Steve's something. The beach-boy blond guy

gave massages and Isaacs would not let him t ouch him. He was too curious about other

peoples business. Someone had told him that Penny had once dated the gut or maybe

somebodies who sort of look dike him. Isaacs couldnt imagine why.

Perhaps she was young and curious. An older   experienced man could save her a lot of

goers.

       And here the wimp was coming right over as if he and Isaacs spoke ever day.

"Good morning!" enthused the masseuse. "C ould we have a cup of latte? Maybe some

fresh-squeezed peach juice? Its important we talk."
       Isaacs grunted and kept walking. Everyone   wanted to talk to him and it was

always important. They needed a hot tip on the market or they had a hot tip and didnt

know how to cash in.

       "Its really important," said the voi ce behind him and Isaacs hesitated: He

couldnt believe our ears. Face red as a tr affic stop, the financier swung on his heel.

"Yes?" he snarled.

       "It about -- Penny," said the back-rubber.

       Isaacs saw red. No one knew about Penelope. He liked to keep his relationships

simple, discreet, between the sheets and not  hing more. "What!" he bellowed as if he

could not believe his ears although he knew he had heard right.

       "Penny," said the bleached blond without backing away as he should have.

       He knows something, thought Isaacs, wishing, not for the first time, that he had

the connections to make people disappear. Not  that he would have used them but having

something to hint at would be a helpful thi ng. It would ruin his coy relationship with the

cops and that was more useful. "What!" he said again to avoid saying anything else.

       "I know.  The pause was significant -- seeing Penelope Urbain."

       "Nonsense," barked the money man.

       "I have pictures," purred the masseuse.   "You were at her apartment just last

night."

       Isaacs reached out a ruddy hand and tore     a manila envelope from the others

grasp. He ripped it open and flipped through  the pictures inside. "Could be anybody," he

said? "It's not I." But it was. He admitted to  himself. There were not many man who had

such broad shoulders and so narrow a wait.   Even in the dim and bury shots there was
every reason to know whose arm Penny        was clinging to. And Penny, his gorgeous

copper-haired Penny, had had her face toward      a street light and had photographed

beautifully.

Isaacs shot a black and Eli look at the young man.

       "No point tearing them up, the wimp said.  "I have them on a disc. They could go

out over the internet and reach everyone whoever heard of you and a lot you didnt. They

call it spam," he added, "and it doesnt come in a can. But youre too -old to know that!"

       Isaacs owned several minor telecom corpora tions and a solid share of two of the

majors, but he ignored the slur. Penny would be upset if her picture went out like this.

Penny was a girl to appreciate the good things in life and Isaacs knew what they were and

had what it took to pay for them.

       He wasnt worried about Bruce Lucent.   Lucent was a has-been before he ever

became anything once he plowed his fancy,   rented by the month car into a telephone

pool. They said the cast went right up to his groin. That guy wasnt going to be making

any ladies happy.

       No, it was Penny Isaacs thought of. A pictur e of his hand up her skirt and on her

bare bottom all over the world would s    our things with Penny for good. The pools

aquamarine-tiled depths beckoned to him.  Isaacs locked both hands on the masseuses

forearm and pulled him and his pictures backward into the

Chorine-scented depths. That takes care of the pictures, he thought,  as he shoved at the

youths face, struggling to hold him under w ith his greater strength and body weight. He

was counting seconds. It would not do to actually harm the blackmailer. Scare him would

be useful.
       Ten seconds, he thought and released his grip and swam from the side. "Help!" he

yelled. He coughed and gasped as if it had been he who had swallowed water.

       "Call the cops!"

       It was the surprise that had taken him o ff balance. A few words in the right ears

and this wet nosed EST would be glad to leave town. Atlanta was too small for the pair of

them and Isaacs knew which one was going to   have to go. He fitted into the puzzle of

local politics, law, charities, and religions  perfectly. Whats his name was a nobody and

he would stay that way.

       Already the clubs staffs were running to help him over the edge of the pool.

       He stood, water running everywhere and   said, "That man grabbed my arm and

sent me off-balance into the pool." Hed  won already, Isaacs knew. They were fishing

the other guy out of the other side of the pool to keep the two of them apart.

       The manager, incongruous in high heels on  the pool level was already at his side,

red-lacquered lips gleaming in the overhead  lighting, pouring out apologies. Her raccoon

eyes rolled with sympathy as she purred and fussed. "Just get you a robe and send that

suit to the cleaners"

       "I have a spare suit in my cubical," he  said. "If I could join you in your office, I

think we need to speak about the behavior of your staff."

       "Of course," said the manager. "You poor dear! I cant imagine." Her voice faded

as Isaacs made his exit, gratified that some one was going to have to go van the floor and

carpet all the way up to the forth floor where his cubical was, on the exclusive Platinum

Peach Executive Cabana Level. He had already
see the soggy shreds of his paper and the pictures fluttering like rotting leaves in the

bottom of the pool and the pool cleaner maneuvering his equipment into place to clear the

water.

       The ladies of the club were due to have  their private hour in a few minutes, and

some of them would even enter the water       before they showered, did their hair and

makeup, and had a liquid and gossipy lunch in the Georgia Girl Grill.

       Isaacs had never set a foot in the place: The avenged age of the of girls was forty-

five and the real babes were at work or working out at this time of the day.

       Isaacs took his time lathering the hair  all over his body, rinsing twice once hot

and once cold. It would do the manager good to sit in her office and worry about what

had happened. Whatever the kids name was,  his job was history, and a few words to the

police -- Better do it now, thought Isaacs, and grimaced

when he discovered, his cell phone had gone into the pool with him.

       That was one thing he hadnt thought to keep a spare of, here. His Blackberry was

ruined, too, but he kept that back up. "Shit," he said elegantly. He smiled at himself in the

mirror, revealing a lot of white, carefully   capped teeth. Just one more thing he could

complain to the manager about. One more touch of reality.

       Although her desk was intended to look imposing, Lucille McHency looked

cornered behind it when Isaacs walked in.    She stood. "I am so sorry," she said. "He

grabbed your arm, you said? You didnt really want the Police."

       "Wanted my attention about something," said Isaacs. "I cant stop to talk with

everyone and he wouldnt take a hint. My suits ruined, my cellophane, my Blackberry."
"Well, the cub will pay for everything," said Lucille. "I dont know what to say about

Stevie."

       "Is that his name," rasped Isaacs?

       "Yes, Steve Suffern. Hes popular with many of the clients." She toyed with a

letter opener. "You say he touched you. Im sure he meant well."

       "Im not a man to make a fuss," said  Issacs, knowing that meant they both knew

that as a member of the board he was a ma n who could and did, "but if Id hit my head

when he sent me for a tumble"

       "Oh, God," wailed Ms. McHency.

       "I mean.  We have to think of the club. A lawsuit could break us. I just lost a few

things and some time. Does he have a contract?"

       "Yes. Yes. We have all our employees sign contracts Mr. Isaacs. Who know that."

She went to the file cabinets along the  wall, unlocked one, and hunted within. Isaacs

admired her rear in its tight skirt. Like a  peach packed into stretch Lycra. She had been

good-looking in her time and kept herself up but

       "Here it is," gabbled Lucille.

       "Let me look that ore," growled Isaacs.

       She handed it to him along with a fetching   glimpse of the top half of her black

lace bra in the low neckline of her blouse. Be hind her, on the industrial gray wall, filled

the wall with hints of a world beyond Atlanta.

       "I think we can just ask me." he paused.

       "Suffern," supplied Lucille. "His name is Suffern. Hes popular"

       "I think the board can just ask him to leave. We cant risk a lawsuit.
       Something goes wrong after an incident like this, the board and management

could be seen as negligent."

       "Oh, yes, I see," said Lucille.

       "See its one the agenda for Friday,"     said Isaacs. "I have to get about my

business." He needed to speak to a contact   or two in the police to make sure anything

Suffern had at his place was removed before the boy got sacked.
                                       

       It would pick today to rain, thought Venice, looking out the window into the early

morning rain. Everybody talks about the   weather, but nobody does anything about it.

Who said that? Somebody famous . . .  Abraha m Lincoln? Or maybe Benjamin Franklin?

Andrew Venice impatiently pushed the question out of his mind. He was the kind of man

who did things, not thought about them. And today was the day . . .  well, he had his

plans.

       The rain was coming down in steady bucketfuls. Not the gentle kind of summer

rain that "maketh the little flowers to grow," but a drenching, cold Georgia rain that

nobody in his right mind would go out in if they  had any sense or, for that matter, choice

in the matter. The rain didn't look like it  was going to stop anytime soon, either. Andrew

Venice shrugged his manly shoulders. He had his plans, and he wasn't going to let a little
bad whether stop him from doing what a ma n had made up his mind to do. And Arthur

Venice was every single inch a man -- he had no doubt at all about that. Neither did

anyone who'd had anything to do with him, especially the scum who ran afoul of him in

the course of his police work. Some people might think that at the age of 40, he might be

getting on in years. But nobody who had anything to do with Andrew Venice was going

to have any question about his manliness.

       That's what I like about Margaret, he told himself. She knows a good thing when

she sees it, and knows enough to grab on to it and not let go. With a body like that, a man

could get used to being grabbed on to. Heh heh, he chuckled to himself. Heh heh.

       He turned away from the window. Time   was a-wasting. He was a man with a

plan, and he knew just what he wanted. Time to go ahead and just do it.

                                         * * *

       Margaret studied her pretty face in the circular magnifying mirror above her

makeup table. She hadn't slept well last night, and -- to her practiced eye, at least -- it

showed. Just her luck to be called on for an   extra shift in the ER, on a night when the

heavy rain had caused twice the usual number of accidents.

       She'd had to cancel her plans for the even ing, a night at the movies with Jocelyn.

They'd planned on seeing the latest Eddie  Murphy comedy at the Grand -- that Murphy

always made her laugh uproariously, which was the best remedy for a set of nerves

frayed by the sight of too much blood and  too many hopelessly fractured bodies. Instead,

she'd had a full dose of exactly what she'd wanted to escape.

       The movie would have been fun -- but deep down inside, she knew that it wasn't

what she really wanted, either. She looked deep, deep into her own peerless eyes, and an
enigmatic smile blossomed upon her ruby jaws. She'd almost turned Jocelyn down,

hoping for a call from him -- she had a hunch,   all right. Any nurse worth her salt knew

when to trust hunches like that. After all, she was a woman first and a nurse second. The

smile broadened and went to her eyes, crinkling her nose as it went past, like a parked car

sideswiped by a passing delivery truck.

       Well, Maggie baby, there'll be plenty of   time for more movies -- and plenty of

time for the other, too! she told her smiling reflection, silently. Plenty of time...

       The doorbell buzzed, startling her, seemingly  as loudly as if a rousing basketball

game had just come to its dramatic final conclusion.

       Margaret Eastman stood, almost unconsciously glancing down at her voluptuous

body clad only in a flimsy peignoir. Could it be?... Could it...? YES! Her woman's

intuition told her. Yes! Yes!

       She rushed to the door, undulating provocatively as she strode impetuously across

the deeply carpeted floor. Heedless of consequences, she flung the door open -- and there

he stood, a tempting vision of manhood even in  a dripping Burberry. A checked slouch

hat protected his hair, as she might have noticed if she had had sufficient time for such a

minute observation. Behind him, the pelting Georgia rain poured down, cruel and

relentless as the sands of time. "Come in   at once!" she cried. "You must not be seen

here!"

       Out on the sidewalk behind him, the pedestrians of Atlanta strolled by idly, little

noting, nor likely long to remember, the tempestuous passions coming to a rolling boil

only a few feet away form their languid gazes.
       "I care not a rap who sees us!" growled Andrew Venice -- for it was, as any astute

reader must by now have guessed, none other  than he who had so impetuously rung her

bell. "I am here to carry you away with me!"

       "Quickly! Inside!" she repeated, grasping his lapels and impelling him through

the door. She pushed it shut behind her and turned to fix him with her sultry gaze, leaning

voluptuously back against the paneled door she had just that moment closed. "I cannot

believe that you are here at last!" she hissed. "I had thought..."

       "Believe it, baby," muttered Venice, tossing aside his hat. The raincoats followed,

then his jacket and tie, his belt, his undershirt...

       They fell to the deeply carpeted floor, pawing one another like impassioned

mammals. "Oh!" she moaned. "Andrew! I never thought..."

       "Don't think, baby," he said, with a nuance at once manly and indescribably

tender. His hands moved surely. For a while  they said nothing. Then soft murmurs broke

from Margaret's lips.

They built inevitably, under his expertly ad   ministered caresses, to a crescendo of

moans... And then the sky exploded around them both.

                                          * * *

       Afterwards, Andrew Venice lit a matched pair of cigarettes and gave one to his

exhausted but still visibly an eager lover. "I have come," he said softly, "to take you away

with me. Margaret, you hot little nurse.  I  can hardly wait to make you all my own!

Where do you want to go to get married?"

       Trembling with delight, she thought a moment, then sighed, "Memphis, of course.

I want to be married by Elvis."
       "Elvis?" Venice pouted. "Won't that be easier in Vegas? I know a couple of

chapels there.  They've got the pink Cadillac and everything..."

       She shook her head, her short hair falling   for a moment in front of her peerless

eyes. "No, darling, it must be as close as  possible to Grace land. It wouldn't be real,

anywhere else. And then" - she gave him a coy smile - "then, you can love me tender."

       "Perfect!" he exclaimed. "Let me make a phone call -- I ought to be able to get us

there in time to get married before supper. And there's a great rib joint on Beale Street --

if you feel like eatin', that is." He leered and patted her buttock.

       "Do you know somebody at the airline?" Sh  e was already on her feet, thinking

about what to pack. Did she have anything   white to wear? Then she realized it didn't

matter -- she was going to be married -- in Memphis! It was a dream come true.

       "Even better, baby." He blew a smoke ring, then continued, "Here's where been' a

cop comes in handy -- I got me a punk dope smuggler by the short hairs, heh heh. He's

got a private jet, he owes me big-time, and  now's my chance to call in a bi-i-ig favor. No

waiting' in long airport security lines for my little Maggie!"

       "Ooh, Andrew, you think of everything,"  said Margaret. She turned around and

looked at him, lying naked on her deep carpet. Her enigmatic smile returned as she

stepped forward. "Say, I just thought of something, myself." She knelt beside him and

gave a shake of her medium-short brown hair. "Do you need to make that phone call

now? -- Or can it wait just a little longer?"

       "Get me started and it'll be a lot longer,  baby," he grimaced, but she lowered her

voluptuous body to the carpet next to him, and soon they were both moaning again. It

was a long time before he remembered to call his smuggler friend.
                                          * * *

       Their pilot turned out to be a slimly-  built black man wearing a neatly trimmed

moustache and goatee and a peaked cap. He  reminded Margaret of an African-American

version of Nikolai Lenin. When she stepped  out of Venice's car onto the tarmac next to

the smuggler's Lear Jet, the pilot looked  her up and down in obvious appreciation. "I got

to say, you sure know how to pick 'em, Mr. Man," he said, with a throaty whistle.

       "Did you ever doubt it?" said Venice, putting a protective arm around Margaret's

shoulder. "Maggie, this punk is Cooter Bill    Delacroix, and there ain't a slicker pilot

outside the Air Force -- specially when he's carrying contraband, which I've got reason to

believe is most of the time, heh heh."

       "Pleased to make your 'acquaintance, ma'am," said the pilot, tipping his cap

ceremoniously. "Now, why don't you two lovebirds get on board, so's we can get up in

the air and I can get this big ol' cop to Memphis and off'n my back."

       "And bring home a planeload of coke, and I don't mean the drinkin' kind," said

Venice. "Well, I reckon I'll be too busy to  stop you, this time. Just remember -- I've got

the goods on you, Cooter. Treat me right, or you'll regret it."

       "I surely do know that, Mr. Man," said Cooter Bill. They climbed aboard his

plane, with him trailing behind them. It seemed only a matter of moments as he ran

through his takeoff checklist, got clearance from the tower, and soon they were winging

west through the gorgeous sunshine, on their way to Memphis -- and marriage.
                                        

       It was one of those days that just    made every pour in your body sweat, so

everything was so slick, so that you left cheek marks when you stood up from vinyl seats,

the kind you tried to wipe away quickly with your hand so no one would notice. But they

had to know because you had those stripes   on your thighs now. It was a hot like only

Atlanta could get. Callie Archer would never forget the kind of hot that day was.

       It was the day she knew that all she was  to Henry Archer was a trinket, a bauble,

another art piece like that weird statuary that lined the foyer of the mansion. She might be

no more than another car for the showroom he  built out in the barn, another train for on

the train tracks he ran around the tree at Christmas and across the living room and down

the hall and through the party room and up the stairs even to their bedroom. Trains and
cars and he had a lot of model airplanes, too, like the plane he used to chase those dogs at

the park, the fat cocker keeling over with  a heart attack when the World War 2 Commie

Causey plane chased it around in circles.

       It had been so hot! Callie came home furious that the air in the Mercedes couldnt

keep up, and shed been stuck in traffic on the Beltline and found no one had thought to

turn the air on in the mansion. She felt desperate to cool off. Shed rushed for the patio,

thinking to throw herself into the pool, Versaci dress and all, when she saw them.

Actually, just him. She

didnt realize he wasnt alone at first. If she had seen he wasnt alone she might not have

made the first assumptions she did.

       Henry was naked, struggling to maneuver over a lawn chair, his butt cheeks

clenched and dimpled as he moved, like he  was trying to pull himself free. For half an

instant she thought maybe hed rolled over while sunbathing and caught his member in

the lawn chair. She realized his age was    beginning to show in the coarse hairs and

wrinkles. She was on the verge of bursting out

in laughter.

       Everything okay, Henry? she trilled in that false voice she used when she was

trying to hide her true feelings from him.

       He stopped moving and seemed at last to pull himself free and turned revealing

that muscular chest and thick neck of a  body builder far younger than 60. Except, he was

60 and kept working out. Thats what had attracted her to him. A millionaire to marry

was a dime a dozen, but millionaires who were built like THAT. But thats when she saw

her husband wasnt alone.
       She let out a small horrified gasp and   tossed her shining black tresses over one

bared shoulder.

       Get out of here! Callie shrieked.

       The woman beneath him smiled at her saucily and slowly rolled from beneath

Henry, her green eyes flashing out her defiance as she threw fire-red tresses over her

shoulders to reveal breasts so perfect they could only have been done by a pro.

       Henry did you BUY her those? Callie shrieked.

       Callie, its not what you think! Henry ex claimed as he stood still slick with the

heat of his passion dripping water like hed just hopped out of the pool but Callie knew it

was sweat because it was so hot, and his hair wasnt wet.

       You take me for an idiot? She asked.

       The woman nodded and giggled as she sauntered toward the floral Indian pink
and green dress shed thrown over the bar, colors that with that red hair were bound to

look hideous. What could Henry have seen in  her? She had freckles, and looked like she

hadnt even tried to cover them. And  her  hips were a little too wide. She looked like a

good brood mare, but not like a thoroughbred. Callie was a thoroughbred, sleek and

finely muscled, soft where she needed to   be, powerful where she needed to be. Now

Callie noticed the empty wine bottle upended in  the coal car of a train, the empty glasses

set in one of the empty grain cars so that if   he flicked a switch it could run out to the

kitchen. Their clothes were scattered, tossed all over the patio and deck furniture and bar.

The woman fished a hot pink bra

out of the swimming pool with the skimmer,  maneuvering the pole like a pro and acting

as if she hadnt noticed Henry and Callie.
       Ill call you, the woman said as she casually walked across the patio carrying

her dripping bra over her shoulder and grabbing  her dress. He red stilettos clicked on the

marble as she paced down the hall of the mansion lined with train tracks.

       Im sorry, Callie, I didnt expect you,   Henry grimaced, his eyes touched her

hair, following the curve of her glossy black  mane to that bared shoulder. If she took one

more deep breath it would fall, certainly, and reveal a breast that had yet to begin to show

its age.

       Thats pretty clear to me. Callie pointedly didnt look at him. Instead she was

looking at his groin, the offending part now   less bold. How long has this been going

on, she stated.

       Really, my dear, just this once. Youre   all I need. I rejoice every day that a

woman so young, I cant believe youre only  40, so voluptuous, so incredibly wonderful

could want me. I beg that you will forgive me    , stay beside me as I enter my golden

years.

       Callie felt the cold hard place inside her begin to warm a little and tried to force it

back inside her to cling to the anger she   should feel for the way he wronged her, right

here in her own house, well, actually his house, but like hers because they lived here

together.

       Shes younger than me. Callie told him angrily.

       I didnt even notice. You have to understand we were drunk. I was at the Polo

Club and I had a few too many drinks. I saw Ri chard there and we got to talking and one

thing led to another and they kept handing me drinks. And I don t know if shed been

there with Richard or he knew her but suddenly there she was.   I should have known
better. And she was there (I dont even remember her name, I couldnt even call out to

her when we had

sex because I didnt know it) and you werent, when that horrible fiery beast you know

so well roared up from within and consumed me. It was wrong. It was so wrong, Callie, I

beg you for your forgiveness he offered.

       Could it have been the drinks? He did appear flushed in the face. And there was

the empty wine bottle. And how many drinks had they had at the Polo Club?

       You hurt me, Henry Archer, she stated regally. Dont ever do it again.

       Henry could see from her eyes that she was softening her stance, that he was pull

her back and corral her as he had every time shed started to bolt from the paddock. She

wasnt a filly anymore, not like when he first spied her. But she wasnt an old nag yet

either. He liked it when she decorated his arm, when her laugh rose up into the

chandeliers during parties, when she screamed out her ecstasy when he rode her into the

wee hours. She was still a fine mare and he wasnt ready to put her out to pasture. For

one, she would cost him too much.

       Callie watched his face change, from the humble fear of someone caught in a very

great lie, to the defiance of one thinking how they might defend themselves, to that tender

look his face always turned when they had just made love.

       She forgave him. How could she not? Lo sing him would be worse than anything

she could imagine. If he died, that might   be worse, or not. At least dying would be

something accidental, or at least not his   fault, not like him leaving her for a younger

woman, a woman with horrid taste in clothes,  freckles AND red hair.  Its not like she

thought she couldnt bear to live
without him, she probably wouldnt much notice, but she didnt want to have to go

through all of this again to ensure he security.

       But she never forgot the important lesson she had learned that she was like any

other favorite toy that when  put away by a child, and that child sees a newer, brighter,

fancier toy right there where they can reach it, and if the childs judgment was impaired

by too much wine, might forget all about the absent toy. That was the lesson of the

Atlanta heat. She could never again sweat without thinking of that.
                                        

       I suppose you're wondering why I've called you here, stated Arthur Nance

seriously, peering over the glasses he really didn't need and only wore because they made

him look more intellectual and impressive,  down into the quivering cerulean depths of

the glistening orbs of the deliciously beautiful young lady sitting in a dusty brown chair

in front of his desk which   was also brown. Irene was wearing a black suit today that

hugged the curves of her body, which were in      all the right places, and in complete

defiance of the scorching humid Georgia summertime air that turned almost everyones

hair into a mass of unappealing frizzles or  else handfuls of limp stuff that resembled

nothing more than masses of overcooked spaghetti, she wore her long, luxurious hair the

color of perfectly sun-ripened wheat loose and falling in shimmering golden cascades
around her dainty shoulders. Her slender yet perfectly formed legs were hidden by

Nances desk, but he knew they were there.

       Nance knew perfectly well that Irene was   the last person in this whole tangled

mess he should be having such crazy, perverted thoughts about -- I mean, even if she

wasnt half my age, there was the involvement with Henry, and now hes dead and shes

supposed to be in mourning. Besides, there was the whole nature of the suspicions hed

been having about certain things, which of course was the whole reason hed called Irene

in to talk to him today which had nothing  to do with the hidden passion that lay hidden

under that prim black skirt but was a matter of much seriousness and import.

       Yes, I am, Irene murmured liquidly,  gazing up at the doctor. Goodness, but he

was in good shape for a man his age! Just look at the kawaii way his shirt fit him. She

could just imagine the six-pack he had under there. Apparently, being a doctor kept you

in good shape, or maybe he just played a lot of golf.

       Well, Ive been thinking a lot about whats been happening lately, ever since the

accident, Nance proclaimed, rising from his seat and pacing restlessly around the desk,

twiddling a pen absently. Its always seemed funny to me that Bruce Lucent survived

the crash, and Henry Archer didnt. He watched Irene carefully like a hawk to see if

shed blush or have any other reaction to this mention of Archers death, but she looked

as calm and smooth as an unused jar of peanut butter before someones stuck the knife in

(the creamy kind, not the crunchy, because her skins not lumpy like the lumps you get in

crunchy peanut butter).

       I dont think its that strange, commented Irene with a shrug, tossing a

gleaming lock of hair over her shoulder with  one perfectly-maincured hand. Its just the
way things are, you know? Sometimes people live and sometimes they dont. Especially

in car crashes.

       Well I think its strange, retorted Nance.

       I know you think its strange, Irene snapped, you just said it.

       Dont you want to know why I think its strange?

       Fine, Irene sighed, I guess I should let you tell me. She was starting to get

bored, and Arthur Nance was starting to look a  lot less hot, even if he did have that sexy

little moustache.

       Okay, Nance began. Setting down the pencil before he stabbed himself with its

point (he did this once, and it meant he couldnt work for days) .It hurts like crazy! I went

to the doctors and they had to dig the point out and everything.  I think you can die of

lead poisoning if they dont get the point out],  he clasped his muscular hands behind his

back and commenced to pace around the small, windowless office. There was a vase of

flowers on his desk, and the petals were slowly falling off them. Its about your father.

       My father? queried Irene, looking surprised. Obviously this wasnt something

shed expected the handsome doctor to bring up. Arthur stared at her. Did she look guilty,

or just surprised? Despite his usually extreme perspicatiousness in matters of judging the

human physiognomy in times of stress, which ability came to him through many years of

being a doctor and having to deal with stressed and not always completely honest patients

and relatives of patience, which was stupid  because how was he supposed to treat people

properly if they didnt tell him the truth about there symptoms and stuff? Thats what you

go
       Yes, Nance pronounced ponderously and withemphasis. Your father. Tell me,

Miss Stevens, what can you tell me about your father?

       Irene sat quietly for a minute and thought. Finally she raised one perfectly golden-

arched eyebrow, and answered, Not a lot, really. He was always sort of distant when I

was growing up. He only really noticed me if I was bad, and then he only noticed enough

to punish me. He was a real baka. I suppose you  could say thats why I made a lot of the

choices I made, why I wound up the way I did. She sighed, which made her already

impressive cleavage try to leap for freedom   out of the linen-blend prison of her suit

jacket. And briefly made Arthur Nance forget completely about what he was going to say

next. But then he remembered.

       Well, Miss Stevens. I have reason to believe that he was involved with a friend

of your late... he paused, trying to think of  a delicate way to put this and then giving up

because there really wasnt any delicate way to put it. your late boyfriend, Mr. Archer.

       You think my daddy was involved with Henry? Irene exclaimed, jumping to her

feet and looking alarmed in a way that Arthur  didnt have to be a detective or a doctor or

even someone who played one on TV to be able to figure out, it was that obvious.

       No, my dear, I didnt say that. I said he  was involved with one of Mr. Archers

friends, he stressed. A friend by the name of...Rory Edwards.

       There was a silence, and all you could hear was the beep-beep of hospital

machines. This suddenly made Nance realize that the office door was open (because

otherwise he couldnt have hear the machines), and he rushed hastily over to close it,

thinking, Shit...what if someone heard that? Wh at if Bruce Lucent heard it? Of course he

hadnt gotten to the part that involved Bruce yet, but what if the brilliant young software
designer had heard and had somehow made  the connections, even though Nance himself

wasnt sure that what he suspected was anything more than the flimsiest of tissue-paper

rumors? That, Nance thought grimly to himself, would be a very, very bad thing.

       Meantime, Irenes already porcelain-pale complexion had gone completely dead

white. You think daddy was involved with Rory? she repeated through lips gone numb

like when you go to the dentists and the Novocain gets shot into not quite the right spot.

       Yes, stated Nance, shutting the door  with a melodramatic click. And theres

more.

       More? repeated Irene, sinking back down into her chair.

       More, Nance confirmed. This is what makes it all so suspicious you see.

       No, I dont see.

       You will. Because Rory was in cahoots the whole time with Isadore Trent.

       WHAT?!?! shrieked Irene. THAT STUPID, GENDER-CONFUSED

PONYTAILED FREAK?!

       Now, now, Nance chided, thats no way to talk about someone. Isadore may

have had some issues, but shes a person just like anyone else. He paused, and his

chocolate-brown eyes glazed over with memory as he remembered another person, so

very long ago, whod had the same issues and  had been so cruelly taken away from him

because of them. Young people could be so  cruel, especially young people still in school

and surrounded by such incredible pressure to  belong, conform, fit in with a group -- any

group, just as long as they could say they fit in somewhere. Irene had folded her arms

under her perfect, melon-shaped breasts and was glaring at him. Nance forced his mind

back to the present and continued.
       This is what makes it all so damn suspicious, you see. Two men, one dies in a

car crash, one survives a car crash. Each has a friend -- Bruces friend is Isadore, and

Henrys friend is Rory. And a common person they each know: your father, Irene. Isaac

Stevens, the one meeting point of all this  crazy insanity. Theres more going on than you

could possibly guess, and your father was right    there in the thick   of it, connected to

Isadore and Rory.

       Do you have any proof of any of this?  Irene hissed, glaring at the doctor with

hate quivering in her cerulean eyes.

       Thats not important. Whats important is that we learn the truth. Proof can come

later.

       Well, I do not believe a word of it. And what about you, Dr. Nance? You treated

both Henry and Bruce. One of them lived, and the other one didnt. How do I know YOU

arent the common point connecting it all?

       Irene, you know that isnt true, Arthur   murmured gently. Im a doctor, my

mission is only to heal. I only want to learn the truth, not hurt anyone.

       Suddenly, Irene burst into tears, flinging  herself against Arthurs manly chest and

burrowing into its strength. Im sorry, she cried between sobs. I...I just didnt want to

believe it. Please...what are we going to do?

       Well do what we have to, declared  Nance, whose mind was now racing even

as he held the sobbing young girl in his solid, toned arms. Already he was beginning to

formulate a plan. It was a crazy plan, but he  thought it might have a chance of working,

and if it did work then everything would fall into place, like a house of cards collapsing
when you put just one card too many on top of  the fragile structure. Well find out the

truth.
                                        

       A gray crepuscular light seeped stripily  down onto Bruces face. He blinked and

yawned. Whas happening? he murmured, rolling over to hug his pillow.

       His pillow! What had happened to his pillow? It was no longer his hypo-

allergenic polyester-fiberfill king-sized favorite. This was a half-sized foam-rubber

hockey puck. Reflexively Bruce sat up, and was suddenly abruptly felled halfway up like

an oak tree by a sharp blow to the fore   head. He lay back, stunned and rubbing the

rapidly-swelling red lump above his left  eyebrow. The ceiling had dropped! It was now

thirty inches above his face, a concrete ceiling crossed by steel girders. It was a steel

girder he had hit his head on.

       From directly below him a deep voice  growled. Shad dup, prison bride. Or Ill

smack ya till ya do, huh?
       From slightly further below -- Bruce   had a good ear -- an even deeper voice

snarled, Lay off you fuckin noise, you fuckin motherfuckas. Its five fuckin a.m.

       Bruce lay very still, trembling. What happened? Who were these people, in his

bedroom? Rolling only his eyes around the      room, he took in his surroundings. His

comfortable bedroom had changed horribly.  A barred window through which a tiny slice

of gelid dawn sky peeped. Concrete block walls, concrete floor, concrete ceiling, painted

shiny gray and adorned with graffiti in many colors. Without comprehension his eye took

in the scrawl on the ceiling above his bed. In  an indelible blue magic marker the gnomic

curlicue resolved into the inscription.

       Was it, could it be -- had everything been a dream?!?  "I don't feel very fortunate,"

Bruce complained as his friend helped him  from the low-slung red car, "I hurt all over

and I don't remember a thing after I left that  bar over on Martin Avenue.  I wouldn't be

surprised if the police didn't want to talk  to me about what happened.  Not that I could

help them because I don't remember anything" he added as an afterthought.    This only

happens on Dallas, Bruce told himself, whimpering silently in the back of his throat.

       What was this place? He lay on a metal bunk with a thin mattress almost nine feet

above the floor, a bunk from which ominous creaks and shakings began to emerge. Like

Moby Dick rising from the ocean depths, a     shaven dead-white skull slowly ascended

above the horizon of his bunk. You fucker, this vision intoned, scowling. I was asleep.

I was dreaming about little Mattie. I was warmin her baby bottle in the microwave. And

you, you fucker -- you fuckin WOKE ME UP.

       One look into those crazy green eyes and  Bruce knew he was in the presence of a

maniac, a genuine deluxe homicidal maniac, little Mattie or no. A hand the size and color
of an albino catchers mitt rose into view and moved inexorably towards his throat. Bruce

shrank back in the narrow bunk, clutching his  thin scratchy brown blanket and pressing

himself hopelessly against the cold unforgiving concrete block at his back. Conversation,

that was the ticket -- cordial conversation on topics of mutual interest. Is this jail? he

quavered.

       Its fuckin Death Row, motherfucka, the Great White Whale snarled. And you

know what that means? It means, I fuckin waste you, and there aint nothin they can do

to me no more. Im like a desperate man, if you take my meanin. His hamlike hand

clamped inexorably around the neck of Bruce s pajama top. Bruce was dragged headfirst

out of the bunk and dropped like a dead fish onto the floor. Luckily he was still clutching

his foam-rubber pillow, which broke the impact a little. Right in front of his nose, the

Great Whites pallid bare feet, seamed with   corns and wrinkles from too-tight athletic

shoes, seemed to be the size of canoes.

       Goddam it, Bodine! Suddenly a pair of large flat feet, black as shoe polish,

slapped down onto the floor. The occupant     of the middle bunk had entered the fray.

Cant we go one single goddam day without a scrap, huh?

       There was a solid meaty sound, the sound of solid dark meat hitting white Bodine

muscle. Bruce curled up small, hoping not to   be stepped on. Fuck it. You think just

because you got in on twenty fuckin counts    of serial rape and murder that you such

fuckin hot stuff?

       They keep on telling us black folks we got oversized sex drives, so whats a man

gonna do, huh? The huge black man glared down  at Bruce. Death Row is goin to hell,
just like the goddam United Nations. Lookit this little yellow shit here. Its all this

affirmative action to blame.

       Show you an oversized drive, fucker. From his vantage point on the floor Bruce

could see the home-made shiv Bodine  the Whale was flashing, pulled from his

waistband.

       Suddenly there came a clang of metal on metal from outside the cell. Chow call,

folks. Chow call. The wardens were coming! Bruce sat up. Keys clanked and doors

opened, one by one, nearer and nearer. Bodines shiv vanished like magic into the top of

his sock.

       The barred door of their cell slid back with a resounding clang, and the black man

and Bodine shuffled sullenly out. Bruce scrambled to his feet. Hey, man -- this is all a

dreadful mistake! Im, you know, innocent.

       The warden didnt even look at him. Save it for your lawyer, pal.

       I didnt kill Callie!

       Sure, pal. And Im former First Lady Barbara Bush. Get a move on, will ya?

       Please! I shouldnt be here!

       Bodine shot a look of contemptuous pity  back over his shoulder at Bruce. And

you know little Mattie, that wasnt my fault. It was that fuckin two-timin arrogant

woman, her mother. The razor blade -- all her idea.

       Sure, Bruce said, his teeth chattering. He tottered rapidly along in the line,

single file, down several open-riser steel staircases and then down a long bare concrete

corridor to the cafeteria. This was a cavernous windowless basement space, lit harshly by

the pitiless glare of fluorescent lights, its  windows shielded by heavy grates. A haze of
cigarette smoke hung bluely near the ceiling.   The trays were pressboard, the utensils

were plastic, and the plates were Styrofoam. He held out his tray and a server in a hairnet

plopped down a spoonful of something colorless swimming in greasy ichor. It was either

grits or scrambled eggs. The coffee, in Styrofoam cups, was tepid and so weak he could

see the bottom of the cup. He added a sugar and coffee creamer to see if that would help.

       Was it better to sit with his cell-mates, or to find another table and hope he wasnt

joined by a child murderer or a serial rapist? Better the devils you know that the devils

you dont, he decided. But not too  close, and not too far. He chose a place at the further

end of the huge black mans table. At least he seemed to be unarmed. His cognomen

seemed to be Pericles, and he was joined by a number of compatriots who lit cigarettes

and rapidly scarfed down the food. Bruce could only pick at his own plate. I have to get

out of here, he told himself. I have to talk to my lawyer! We have to fight this all the way

to the Supreme Court!

       Suddenly Bodine sauntered up to their table. First Im going to gut you like a

fuckin trout, he announced. Then Im going to pound the little snots head in, for

dessert.

       Pericles seemed unimpressed. You bore me, man.

       Bodine picked up Bruces nearly untouched plate and threw it like a Frisbee. Gray

goop flew everywhere, but there was enough stuck on that when the plate hit Pericles it

glopped down his T-shirt front. Without visible   effort Pericles picked up his chair and

slung it at Bodine.
       All around them the other inmates stood   up and yelled for blood. Plates, cups,

chairs and food flew through the air. Bruce  prudently abandoned his seat and crept under

the table.
                                        

       Irene checked her face in the mirror and the gun in her handbag just once more

before she  found the reserve she was looking  for in herself.  Popping in a fresh breath

mint (just in case), she pushed open the boardroom door to confront the three people who

had ruined her life and killed her love.

       Her father, Isaac Stevens, turned quickly, sloshing the  whisky (a wonderful

single malt) from his glass.  "Dammit girl !, I taught you to knock when entering a room.

All good women know that!"

       "Yes father I do know to knock, but then I didn't have the bad manners to plot to

kill my best friend and my business partner then, did I?"
       The two other people in the room took a  sudden greater interest in this new

conversation.

       Penelope and Rory stood too close for  a casual chat, and the lipstick smears on

Rory's face seemed to give rise to the evidence that these two at least had been quietly

occupied as Isaac got celebratory drunk.

       "Well. Well.  The little missy's gone and got  herself into a bit  of a fit now ain't

she? snipped Rory as he slipped his arm around Penelope's slim waist.  "What ya trying

to say gal?"

       Irene suddenly realized that her plan to scare her father into confessing the

attempted murder of Bruce and the accidental death of her lover Henry might have one or

two flaws to it.  She hadn't realized that all three had been plotting this coup for months

and now she would just be one more pretty little speed bump on their road to riches.  As

this kernel of truth popped open, Irene reached into her purse to grab the gun, but  strong

feelings of misgiving began to overwhelm her.  Could she shoot her father, the man who

had raised her since her mother's untimely demise?

       Rory dropped his hold of the luscious Penelope's waist and lunged for Irene sure

that he, the big strong man that he was,   could stop this tiny girl from going or doing

anything.  His eyes gleamed evilly, until suddenly, they took on a look of surprise.  The

hand that had so recently been fondling Penelope's besom, now clutched his own

bleeding midsection as he dropped to his    knees on the overly expensive Persian rug.

"She shot me, that damn bitch daughter of yoren shot me!"  And with that exclamation,

he pitched face forward with an "OOF!".
       Irene nudged his head with her perfectly pedicure right foot.  He didn't seem to

notice, so she figured he was dead.  Good, one less problem to worry me. she thought.

       "What in the hell so ya think you are    doing?"  shouted Isaac, fear causing his

voice to waver a bit.  "Now you've gone way beyond any manners they taught you at that

fancy boarding school I sent ya to!"  "You just do not shoot people, that's not proper!"

       So, thought Irene, this is what real power   feels like.  I like it!  And with that

thought she raised the gun and pointed it at the remaining two.  She waved the gun

casually, between the two like a lazy band conductor  in 2 / 2 time.

       "Now Father, tell me again how mother died in that car fire.  You know, the one

in which your brother was not really there?    And how sorry you were that  Henry, your

oldest and dearest friend, father of your grandchildren to be, died in that same little

accident, and how that left you temporarily    in charge of Bruce's company. Oh and

Penelope, how many beds did it take to line this up?  Did you enjoy my dad ?  What is it

with you and these old rich bastardy?"

       "Actually, You were much more fun sweetie. These old guys just can't measure

up.   Remember the trip to the Bahamas and that beach?"  Penelope slowly moved

forward witheach word, distancing herself from Isaac .  "We sure rocked that world.  I'll

never forget how you said we should never come back to Atlanta, and how we could live

there forever on your trust fund."  Penelope reached a hand out to Irene and  tried to

reach out and stroke her cheek.

       "Forget the Bahamas bitch!   Irene slapped Penelope's hand away. "You left me

there to rot and next I knew I was paying bail and bribes for some stolen jewelry! And,

dammit, I didn't even get to enjoy any of it!" Irene spit the words into Penelope face as
the gun spit three rounds into her gut.  "How's  it feel to die a piece at a time, one bullet

for each day I spent in jail for you! This is all you'll ever get from me!"

       "Reeenee baby, sweetheart,  now don't   shoot your daddy, we can come to an

understanding, can't we?'  Isaac sniveled as   he dropped to his knees in front of his

daughter.

       "Don't call me that!  You ain't got no right s to use Mama's name far me."  Irene's

accent tore through as her tears began to fall.  " Daddy, I don't wanna kill ya, but If'n you

don't die, then I know y'all just find a way to get rid of me and the babies."

       "No, honey. Give me a chance and we can fix all this up in no time.  We'll keep to

the plan and take the company, that feel Bruce'll never figure out it was us until we 're off

living the good life in Europe with his money.    How's that with you?  I control all the

company and most of the shares, so we can ha ve it all and be gone in a week.  So, Please

don't shoot me!"  Isaac crawled toward his daughter pleading for his life and thinking that

he could get the gun away when the other two fools couldn't.

       "Fuck off  Father! Die like a man! Not the crawling worm I've come to know!"

BANG!  BANG!  Two more shots tore thought the carpet.  Isaac cowered down hands

over his head and began to shake.

       Irene smiled.  "Well daddy, guess this  is goodbye, Kiss kiss Hugs, Tata.  BANG!

One more shot rang out and Isaac's very expensive toupee took a wild leap from his now

bald and bleeding head.

       Irene sat back to take in her handiwork.  Three very dead bodies lay around the

room, each with a different expression  on what was left of their respective faces.
       Irene noticed a smudge of blood on the tip of her toe and bent down to wipe it off.

She used the hanky from Rory's breast pocket as he no longer needed it.

       Bruce rolled into the room.  "Great work my love,  I'll have my people clean this

up and we need never bother with this again.    Now go get cleaned up, we have a

meeting of the board of directors in an   hour and I need my new Senior VP ready to

shine!"

       "I'll see you in ten babe!  Got those tickets ready for Barcelona?"

       "Sure do and then 3 weeks on the French      Riviera, then pop home and get the

nursery ready for our boys!"

       "Isn't life great when ya got all the m oney and no scruples?"  and they laughed as

they left the gory scene to the clean up crew.
                                         

       Inside Richard Isaacs.

       Outside--below--so far--Atlanta. Teaming urban sprawl, Boeings and LearJets

circling like buzzards to the corporate stink  of carrion, cruising hot thermal of greed. Old

jets never die, they just go into a holding pattern over Atlanta. Can it be that it's life itself

that's the holding pattern?

       Somewhere out there--down there--misted  by the steamy fog of his heated breath

on the cool air-conditioned glass--Margaret Eastman's curves fill the tight-stretched

spandex city with their Silicone bounty. Shouldn't that be enough to live for? Shouldn't

it? Shouldn't it?

       Not. If. He. Couldn't. Have. Her.
       Inside the ghostly reflection of the office window. The shadow of a man. Richard

Isaacs, superimposed on the crawling city. A giant over an anthill.

       A giant ready to lay down on that an thill and pour honey on itself and let it eat

him alive.

       Like it hadn't already tried.

       How far he'd grown from little Richie Isaacs the kid everyone loved to pick on!

The kid who stole a bag of apples for the teacher from the tree in the Johnson's yard. The

kid who nobody ever knew put the rocks in Mr.  Miller's garden hose or the Kool-Aid in

the principle's gas tank or the prank calls  to random names in the phonebook to ask if the

Bowels were there or did they move. O h, he was a tricky little devil. Nobody ever put

one over on little Richie Isaacs. How did it all come to this? Was it the abuse of the priest

at the First Baptist Church with the red silk Cossack around his neck announcing his

corrupt virtue for no one to see? Was it Pop taking the belt to him between belts from

quart bottles of Rheingold? Was it Uncle Jeb turning into the driveway to pulverize his

beloved Lionel Trains under the cruel wheel s of the old John Deer? Was it Ma on the

creaky porch in her frumpy house dress and pink slippers and curlers sipping Mint Juleps

like there was no care in all the world? Oh,  mama! he thought sadly. I'm so sorry I never

went to your funeral! How did it ever come to this for Missus Isaac's best baby boy?

       The well built man surveyed his office       environs in a reverie that was so

uncharacteristic for him. The designer furniture  that looked like they carved it from the

iceberg that sank the Titanic. The abstract   impressionist original on the wall that he

always thought looked like Ed what's-his-name from the movie version. The bank of T.V.
screens showing MS-NBC, the financial feeds.  The antique globe he liked to spin and

trail his finger over it to get a tactical sensation of the mountains and the valleys rising

and falling like a graph of today's Dow.

       His fingers . . . His fingers . . . Looking at his hands, the backs of which were

beginning to show age spots like rust--rust  which forms not on peach trees, not on living

growing things,  things that soak up decay ing putrid soil and drank lemony sunlight and

gave back the breath of life, but rather rust  which forms on iron, things of cold and metal

hardness, Richard's fingers were perversely aware of the power they held. To manipulate.

To mold. To force, with their iron cold meta  l hardness, the objects of their will in the

direction they willed them. A few taps of  these fingertips on the right keys on the right

board at the right moment--lives were ruined. Buy low, sell high. Every thing has a price.

Richard Isaccs's was higher than he knew. Holding the metaphor in his palms, all the

blood drained from his sanguine face.

       His hands could kill.

       Him.

       His hands could kill him.

       Ye gods, what terrible power!

       Should he do it?  he wondered. It wasn't like the motivation wasn't nonexistent.

Despair was kudzu. Choking creeping ravenous  kudzu, nothing to do but to napalm it.

You had your bull markets of the soul and bear markets. Crashes and depressions--and he

wasn't talking about the kind of crash Bruce Lucent lost his shorts in. Sometimes one had
no choice but to realize the loss. Sometimes a guy hadda take the cosmic tax deduction in

the sky. You didn't always get an option or a choice or another alternative.

       This could be it.

       The big correction . . .

       All umpteen shrieking stories . . .

       It was not to be. Damned sealed glass, damned climate control, damned

transparent prison--or maybe a phone cord around the neck, he reflected, however there

was nowhere to hang from in this sterile plastic state-of-the-art-environmentally-correct-

eco-friendly cage, goddam Eurotrash designers  claimed they thought of everything but

they didn't think of  this now did they, space didn't have  every modern amenity, couldn't

gas yourself in a General Electric microwav e, didn't suppose he could buzz down to the

lobby and request a halfway decent sprinkler head to hang his sorry gullet on, but

couldn't you rig something through the cord, twist a ruler through it, couldn't you tighten

it yourself? Turning and torquing and winding,  tighter and tighter, muscles straining in

his merciless shoulders, cranking a bulwark closed on a sinking ship--would he have the

balls to go through with it, wring the breat h from his own gasping throat? Would he

plead for his life, would he say: "Dick, for  God sakes, don't do this, you have so much to

live for, don't be a fool, don't throw your lif e away?" Would those hands, his iron hands,

his terrible aging rust-corroded sin-stained  hands take on their own DoctorStrangelovian

personality, could nothing he say deter them from their inexorable will?

       He wrestled his stygian urges down with Herculean aplomb.

       Got a hold of himself.

       Control.
       Control he could do.

       Alright. No Dopplering dotcom plummet       to eat a terminal snack of pigeon-

flavored pavement after the dead cat     bounce. No jolt of autocratic asphyxiation,

wrenching the Apex Data Ruler the way he   wrenched himself in the wee of the night

when he lay prostate on his back and no one  could hear him ejaculate Margaret's name

into the Sealy Serta mattress drenched with   the carnal effluents of desire. No tragic

grandiose flinging of the BellSouth fiber=optic  wiring over the rafter beam since there

wasn't one, positioning the SemperFidic    ergonomic office chair, looping the Jimmy

Hendrix original hand-made collectable silk necktie neck, kicking the spinning chair

across the anti-static mat cleated like Beckum's soccer shoes to the migraine Millikin

Carpet, kicking the climate controlled air   with its direction adjustable hypoallergenic

louvers, kicking the generic afterlife. There was always Valium.

       Stumbling to the kidney-shaped translucent sea iceberg green designer desk, the

bottles came into his iron hands like magnets snapping onto iron. Valium, Zoloft,

Previcid, Lescal, Seconal, Zantac, Paxil, Ultram...Dewars. Before he knew it, the stock

ticker of his life would be passing before    his eyes. then sweet oblivion. Glorious

nothingness. No more tortuous silicone visions, no more danger sharp curves ahead, no

more Bruce Lucent and his infernal reeking testosterone making a man want to be things

no decent man ought to want to be and do things no decent man ought to want to do, no

more onus of law enforcement's fetid breath hot under his collar, no more ratting, no

more backstabbing, no more megalomaniac Machiavellian machinations, no more

Margaret, no more black Fridays, no more blowoff tops, no more crack spreads, no more

drunkards walks, no more high-ticking, no mo re LEAPs, no more margin calls, no more
market timing, no more mental stop-loss, no more momentum indicators, no more

multiple linear regressions, no more opportunity  costs, no more outside reversal months,

no more pessimistic rates of return, no more pivot points, no more probability density

functions, no more quarterly net profit margins, no more relative return standard

deviations, no more resistance lines, no more   shaved candlesticks, no more spikes, no

more splines, no more whiplashes, no more whipsaws, no more upswings, no more

downswings, no more, no more, no more, no more no more no more no more no

       No.

       No! He did not give up that easy!

       He was a commodity traded on his own futures exchange. He would die before he

sold himself that short. He was almost jigged out there, almost whacked, almost melted

his own account. But Richard Isaacs was not done yet. Richard Isaccs did not go down

that easy. Richard Isaacs was a market maker. Richard Isaacs was printing on the O!

       He slung the handful of pills in an overhand arc toward the direction of the

designer wastebasket, watching them soar  through the luminous light of the Ptolemies

World Classic omnidirectional task light, heard them scatter like shotgun shot into the

lacquered executive wastebasket with the little bar graphs decorated on it, the pinnacle of

all his superficial aspirations, the symbol for his nearly untimely fall.

       Richard Isaacs returned to the window   again. Dick Isaacs looked through his

reflection. No one looked back. No one ever did.

       Outside the cruel uncaring metropolis. The juggernaut he would bring to it's

knees.

       Inside Richard Isaacs.
