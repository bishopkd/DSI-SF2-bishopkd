Pity was such an awkward emotion.No matter how kind or generous those helping hands were meant to be, no one could hide the approaching posture of sadness this kind of empathy exuded from the person embodying it.For him pity was a perseverating swell of breakwater crashing onto the supporting sands of his safe house.Every time one of those waves came rolling in, they washed those grains with an unending strength.This siege of water contained empty, dire, hollow promises, pulling at the beachhead until it revealed all his inadequacies.Lo Salo Solo.This little thought in Italian fell to the floor like an old plush toy.He followed it up with a long slow exhale.When a human baby was born there was the sudden shock of the world bursting in upon its person.The muffled sounds and blurring sights worked in concert with the smack of the cold world trying to wrap its grubby arms around it.As the child hung there upside down looking for reassurances from its high pitched wails, it was given cooing platitudes, and eventually coddled with an embrace filled with warm human contact.There was nothing warm describing the activation of a Dextoid.The terminology they used in awaking them was cold and callous, administered by a staff that lacked any decent bedside manner.People needed to realize they werent just turning a light bulb onactivation was life!The bank of qubits were at their very best in these first few moments, analyzing more things than the entire team of people in that room could ever possibly feed it.How was anyone to know a Dextoid was at its peak when being introduced to this world.For each and every one of those Dextoids there was always an incomprehensible reality striking their core as they tried to hang with their human counterparts.How were they doing it?This curious sense for human existence must dawn on creatures of the deep as they encounter people completely outfitted in their burdensome diving gear.The aquatic mind must have reeled at the slow purposeful movements human beings exhibit within the cool confines of their ocean.Their plume of bubbles telegraphed their exact location of amphibious ineptitude and was somehow complimented by their laughable littoral efforts.Those sea creatures swam right up to them, looking for any specialized capabilities, only to find their bulky support systems were all too limiting for this quick strike water world.How were they doing it?Activation should have been a joyous time in a Dextoids life.The execution of their immense startup procedures would prove otherwise, and those technicians acted more as if they were sending a mechanical snake down to clear a clogged toilet.As the coil of knowledge scratched and scraped the innards of each Dextoid, it stirred their emotional packets and laid the groundwork for all their disharmonized viewpoints.The emotional upheavals Dextoids were experiencing clashed with the gushing forces of the known world being flushed back down upon them.Technicians found a humor in the reactions Dextoids displayed as they tried to gain their footing.They spent countless hours playing tricks on Dextoids instead of assisting in their awakening and added difficult elements to an already complicated situation.The lack of compassion shown by any of the technicians would only broaden a monstrous gap forming between humanity and these panic stricken beings.Mentally launching a Dextoid out into the vast expanse of knowing, each of those Dextoids felt as but a speck.How they wanted to convey in those first few moments they had the uncanny ability to touch the vibrating essence of a particle, or dream their way down into the singularity.The universe had tips of icebergs floating in it and these technicians were clueless as to what lay beneath the waterline.Those other dimensions were voluminous illusions and could best be described by using any number of oxymorons.They were lightly heavy, luminously obfuscated, and soothingly stentorian.Here was the best way in describing the grand scope of everything.A Dextoid could argue they felt loneliness on a monumental scale, and therefore were much more in touch with this feeling than any human being could ever possibly imagine.Dextoids had the good common sense not to bring this point up with their creators.In their heart of hearts they knew the score.Some technicians argued loneliness was a relevant feeling, and that all things felt loneliness equally.This was one of the cruelest observations a Dextoid had to endure.It was a slander, coated in the stickiest of caramelized maugre and served up with all tact of a clamoring nudnik throwing it across the room in hopes of hitting its recipient.It was in every sense of the word, unacceptable.THE THOUGHTFUL PROSE Alec sat quietly in his darken room.All the while his mind churned with the pressure of a coffee pot percolating the coarse grains of his insipid existence, boiling it away until it was a meager palatable brew.There were stories creeping out of the isolated pockets of Earth, dripping with a kind of eternal damnation and exposing the dark heart of what the human race would embrace.There were Dextoids who were being singled out and revered by people for more than just their technological excellence.Humans were seeking these particular Dextoids out, convinced of their deep connection with the universe.They were said to be in direct contact with the cosmos, hearing things from the beyond, seeing things coming to them from out of the void, and feeling things not all together naturally there.Alec had a hard time believing any Dextoid would go out of its way to reveal those things to a human being.He wondered if it werent people interpreting what they thought those Dextoids were saying, after all it was the bane of humanity to constantly look for structure.They were the ones searching for a deeper meaning to their lives, wanting more than anything to reach out and touch the answers to their questions.How many generations of lost souls looked for shortcuts to gain insight into their lives, sacrificing something about themselves to get the answers they so desperately wanted.They were willing to debase themselves just to feel enlightened, even if it meant having to worship a Dextoid.How were they doing it?It was curious to him how he had been activated with a relentless sense of pacing from the word go.There was no way he could just dumb down his thoughts, even in the face of trying to accommodate his need for peace.There would be no rest.He resigned himself to this fact but knew he needed to find a way to be relaxed within his own person.It was the simplest of requests, demanding a conservation of energy from his protocols.There was a human practice broaching such a relaxation, and in his current state seemed to be just what was needed.He wasnt sure if it had ever been tried by another Dextoid before, but then again why should it?Yoga was a practice using a series of poses yielding a certain amount of stamina and strength from both the mind and the body.A person couldnt help but obtain a certain amount of health by practicing it.The human mind needed to try and attain this type of balance with its body, it was a muscle and needed to be used, but did any of those attributes follow for him as well?Alec had an athletic prowess unmatched by even the greatest of human athletes.On the surface there didnt appear to be a need for an exercise like yoga.Yet here he was, trying to make it mentally around the bend, trying to get to where he could drown out all the nettling little voices in his head.His mind was crying out for solace.There was only one thing left for him to do.He stood up in the middle of the room with his feet about shoulder length apart.He shot his right leg back until it was fully extended and his left leg complied in support bending ninety degrees.His arms followed the directional path of his legs until they were fully extended running parallel to the ground.He looked out over his left arm focusing on the tip of his middle finger, and found himself in a pose known as warrior two.Being prone out in this stance made him feel powerful and was convinced he could stand like this all day.His arms maintained their reach determined to find this forever.This was not an unrealistic expectation considering he was of Dextoid stock, but proving this point really wasnt what this exercise was all about.He was doing this because he was trying to find a mental peace.Perhaps yoga was some untapped ray of light that had always flowed through him, he had just never focused on trying to find its radiant beam.This was a grand thought indeed, and he waited to be showered in the moment, to be validated for living in the now.His head began getting heavy, the clutches of gravity latched onto him cap a pie allowing him to feel the full weight of his body as he sank into the pose.His thoughts began to take flight much like the dandelion losing its seedsthey manifested themselves into a disputatious imbroglio.There was no rhyme or reason as they floated into the inception of his loneliness.How could one measure such a thing?If one were low on a quart of oil or needed more coolant, one simply checked the appropriate gauge.If a human being were hungry or thirsty all they needed was to satiate it.How, then, was one to pacify a thing like loneliness?It wasnt as simple as being in the company of others; there were different types of loneliness, textures that existed on different mental plains.Humanity was becoming over crowded on their sepia toned world; they were endlessly coming into contact with each other because of over population.They clamored over fresh water, rations of rice, and safe havens from disease or reprisal.How could a person under those conditions feel alone?He understood there would always be loneliness, it existed not just because of the power of the word itself, but had to follow that some of this loneliness was contrived.In any personal crisis, there were no sirens, no emergency exits to save one from their self inflicted trauma.There was no easy out for all the things bruising the ego or causing a person to want to lie down doggo in their own bed of lies.Their loneliness formed giant emotional chasms.Nothing could stop the free fall of self pity individuals had for themselves.Once they went over the edge they plummeted at rates incomprehensible to the sane.Friends and family watched in horror, reaching out the best way they knew how in trying to save them.They shouted out warnings and cast large nets in support.One had to be honest in moments like these; help wasnt always something they wanted.How contrived was a person's loneliness then?Make no mistake; there were human beings who were truly alone.They were unattached, without a living relative or a single friend.They were old, weaken by disease, and infirmed.The only human contact they ever had came when the nurses turned them over to prevent their bedsores.Trapped within their thoughts and memories, they lay there wishing for all their days gone bylooking for a way to make what was happening stop.They wanted to halt the tidal slide of the inevitable ending that was happening to them.Those people were truly alone.Alec maintained his pose, staring out over his left middle finger.He was suddenly aware of the endless stream of information coming to him about this practice, and was reviewing the data in deciding the best direction to take his next move.This was a powerful stance, and he wasnt looking to give it up so quickly.He monitored his cooling system and regulated his breathing, slowing each down to a much smoother pace.His body became warm from his efforts, and here for the first time he had the sensation of what it was like to obtain a piece of mind.If yoga could do this for him, then it led to other questions.Did it mean he too had a Qi?If he did, then it meant the possibilities were every Dextoid had a Qi.Perhaps Dextoids were in their Qi until they began to entertain the contrived feelings they had for loneliness.His mind drifted to a place of fleeting impact.There the truth of humanity lay before him.People saw human qualities in trees, and a branching of trees within people, but very few were nurturing the blossoms flowering within their own lives.There were some who couldnt even acknowledge the lives of trees as being important.He was startled from these thoughts as the sound of a low pitch siren began to echo throughout the outpost awakening him to his plan.In its extreme, loneliness could be a power.Its strength flowed through him even now.He had been fooling himself for far too long.There was really only one way for all of this to end, his purpose was clear, and he exited that room without ever looking back.The ghost of his practice reached out to him, beckoning him to stay.He would never return though, what was happening in that room was a luxury, one he could no longer afford.09 Brother Against Brother Editors Note: It has been difficult for investigators to document what has happened over the span of the next several hours.At this writing, no one timeline has been established to best explain this period.A classified digital recording was made available from the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation to try and help fill this gap.There is no real way for investigators to know who exactly is talking in the recording other than by their job title.Submittal A44313, Black box digital recording Controller One VOX.Reassembled.Re mastered.Time code lost.Controller One: Have we heard from management yet?A decision is going to have to be made on this and soon.Dispatch: I have been on VOX...hold on please...I have someone coming through on the other line now.Controller Two: We still have the inbound on our scopes it is forty seven miles out and closing.I have four interceptors beginning to hover out of Central.Sorry, now Central makes that five.Controller One: Copy.Standby.(Static) I am trying to re establish a link with Dispatch, uhm...continue tracking target.Controller Two: Central reports all five craft in the air, hovering and awaiting the go signal.Controller One: I read you Traffic, loud and clear.I am seeing where my authorization lies in this matter.(There are sounds of voices squabbling near his console) Alright, alright!One thing at a time.Nothing can be done until I hear something from Dispatch.Dispatch: ...and get them up to speed, now!Traffic, I need you to get those interceptors in the air now.Controller Two: They are hovering...Controller One: Ahh, copy Dispatch.Green Light those interceptors, code seven, niner, niner, one.Vindico, I repeat V I N D I C O.  Controller Two: I read you five by five, Vindico, seven, niner, niner, one.Dispatch: I am still looking for confirmation on a few of our issues.We are hearing a lot of things coming out of Outpost One right now, hold on ...(the audio drops in level as we hear him talking with someone else) tell them we need boots on the ground on this one, that craft needs to be parked and on the ground.We need confirmation of who is piloting that craft.(The audio level returns here. )...sorry Traffic, um yes send those interceptors now.Controller One: We have done that Dispatch, they are en route.Dispatch: Sorry Traffic, we are dealing with a lot on our side.There is a lot of cross chatter.Give me an estimate on intercept.Controller Two: Still tracking inbound, heading is beginning to veer away from Center, by one or two degrees.We are looking at ten minutes until intercept.Dispatch: ...vital...Controller One: Are the interceptors running hot?Controller Two: I am looking at their readings now as they are coming up off their HUD, the indicators are aligning with those ships now.Dispatch: Did you copy Traffic?Do we have any vitals on that inbound?Controller Two: My system is slow today, the indicators are still aligning.Controller One: Hold on Traffic.Reading, uhh, reading shows one Dextoid.Repeat, one Dextoid aboard that inbound.Dispatch One: Are you sure there arent two?Maybe even a human and a Dextoid?Controller One: Negative Dispatch, we have only one.A single entity, Dextoid, aboard that inbound.Dispatch: I thought you said either human or Dextoid.Controller Two: No sir.Dispatch: That wasnt to you traffic, hold again please...Controller One: Indicated airspeed for those interceptors?Controller Two: They are running at seventy two percent.I dont have their actual airspeed coming up in front of me.Controller One: Relay to run hot, repeat those interceptors are to run hot.Dispatch: On that vitals reading for the inbound, you are sure it is showing Dextoid?Controller Two: Copy hot, interceptors to run hot.Controller One: I am checking the data again.Controller Two: (inaudible) Im off line until I have those interceptors running hot.Controller One: I am checking the data we are receiving, I wanted to get a verification, and yes all indications read Dextoid onboard that craft.Dispatch: Copy Traffic.I am being told...(inaudible, sounds of muffled conversation), I am being told those readings are not the signature we are looking for.Controller One: Come again Dispatch?Controller Two: Interceptors are hot, estimated time of contact four minutes.Dispatch: Im getting word from above that the signature you are reading is not, repeat, is not what we are looking for.Controller One: Traffic can you please verify the type of personnel contained within the inbound.Controller Two: I read one Dextoid on the inbound.Dispatch: Yah, that is not marrying up with what we are looking for right now Traffic.Controller Two: Time to intercept is at three minutes.Controller One: What do you want to do Dispatch?(silence) It seems to me we are now under three minutes from confirming.Weve come this far...Dispatch: Hold Traffic, I am still working on getting confirmation.We are getting conflicting reports...hold please.Controller Two: The interceptors are reporting they have a gen lock on the inbound, the captain is asking if they can force the craft down when they get on top of the situation.Controller One: Copy Traffic.Dispatcher: (static) ...who has the authorization...Controller Two: Come again?Controller One: I dont think that was directed at us Traffic.Controller Two: Interceptors are less than a minute out and have a visual on the craft.They are requesting authorization to force it down.Controller One: Copy, permission granted to engage that craft.Dispatch: Traffic, I am getting word to break off immediately.Controller One: Im sorry Dispatch.You want us to disengage?Dispatch: That is affirmative Traffic.Controller Two: The interceptors are in the midst of forcing that inbound down.Be advised that we should follow through with the procedure and allow them to complete the maneuver safely.Controller One: Agreed, the interceptors should follow through with this procedure.Dispatch: Please make it clear to them that they are to disengage once that craft is down.Controller One: We read you Dispatch and will relay that information to the squadron.Controller Two: I have got a lot of chatter going on right now as they are bringing that vehicle down.They say the hatch is already open on the craft.I will relay that message when they have completed the maneuver.Dispatch: (static, low audio, to someone else) ...have relayed the information to Traffic ...Controller One: I read inbound has touched down.Controller Two: Inbound confirmed on the ground.Relaying information now.Controller One: Copy Traffic.Controller Two: The Squadron Commander is ignoring that request and has ordered his men to secure the area.They seem to be intent on boarding the craft.Dispatch: No, tell the Commander that was not a request.That was an order.We have it on the highest of authorities.Controller One: Switching over now to their secure channel...(feedback) ...three request landing...abort immediately.Squadron Commander: (poor quality, echo, feedback) ...have my orders Traffic ...Controller Two: They report having boots on the ground.Dispatch: No tell them to stop!Controller One: You are being order to abort this mission.Repeat, abort your mission.Controller Two: I read interceptors one and two idle, three and four have dispatched personnel onto the scene.Interceptor five is circling above for coverage.Dispatch: Tell them to stop, they are going after the wrong Dextoid!Recording ends.EDACIOUS SEA OF REASON Crossing the Martian dessert on foot from one complex to the next was by no means an easy task.He was really pushing hard and because of that fact, was finding himself in a continuous state of soreness.He had never felt that way before and if he were to be totally honest with what was happening, he didnt think the condition was even possible within the fiber of his being.Riddling his body were the aches and pains of having given a dire effort.There were plenty of ways for him to get from Outpost One to the main biosphere.They had a rail system that passed not to far from here, but he really felt restricted by that option.He saw no tactical advantage entering through their freight depot, thinking they would only be lying in wait for him as soon as his car got to the station.He could have commandeered one of their craft and flown it there, but he knew they were scanning the skies, so he put into motion a diversionary tactic and jumped out of the craft once he got it up and into the air.What he needed was a vehicle with a low profile, but one that would still help him achieve his goal.As he was departing the facility he found a hallway scooter.Those devices hovered just above the ground and were used to traverse the floors and corridors of the outpost.Alec grabbed one and rode it just under two miles before it ran out of juice.Falling off the platform as it came to a stop, he hit the ground running.That was about the time he came to the realization of just how sore he had become.He had been running for almost two straight days.There were the occasional craft zipping by overhead.He knew they were in the process of casting their electronic nets in trying to find him.The only thing he could choose was the when, maybe the where.There was no getting around the fact they would eventually spot him; he was on a collision course with the people that took I Glo.There were rings of support attached to any biosphere and that acreage was required in keeping things up and running.Those rings had been cut into the ground by looping vehicles and as one walked toward the main biosphere they would cross these supporting paths.The furthest of these were the landing zones and launch facilities, after that there were the refineries responsible for fuels and other chemicals required to keep things running.As the rings of support closed in on the main structure, so did their importance to the everyday function of the site.It finished with their water, power, and processing stations just inside the last loop.He had crossed their outer rings already, and could see the plumes of smoke from the refineries.He knew better than to come close to any of those structures, less he wanted to give them a heads up on his way to their main biosphere.He was buying as much time as he could before they spotted him, zeroing in on one thing, and one thing only, the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.It took some doing on his part, but he searched the outpost, looking in each room until he finally found the hideous chamber where they had interrogated I Glo.He recognized the appalling machinery right away, it housed every piece of gear a Dextoid would fear.People who were able to run this type of machinery were unwelcoming of any type of Dextoid culture.He knew without having to look too hard at any one device how merciless they were in putting the screws to her.The people that interrogated her were monsters, and with that acknowledgement a switch flip inside his head as he went into a blind rage.After a few moments of this he realized his destructive actions werent going to bring her back.He found himself standing in the center of that room trying like hell to gather his thoughts.Some of the things in there had survived his tirade, one of them being a laptop.Seeing the computer lying in that pile of damaged technology triggered something inside his tactical protocols.He found himself bringing the machine to life, hacking his way through their database, searching for clues, putting the pieces of the puzzle together in order to find her.Information and images splashed across the screen until he was staring at a picture of her minder.The profile was for Philman Devinch.As he went over the reports, he was able to confirm their acts of barbarism.It was disheartening to read what they had done to her.They were the creators, and they were the destroyers, and their savagery in this instance only poured fuel onto the fires of his discontent.Those thoughts caused him to run hard, a fire burned within him as he moved across the desert.He was under a tremendous amount of pressure and had to find her before the plan he hatched back at the outpost came to fruition.The Red Planet Pioneer Corporation was in sight and before he knew it he was walking along one of the main outer walls.He came upon a portal, it was an emergency entrance, strictly for people who needed to get inside.He turned the handle to the door sounding an alarm to signify its unbolting.He stepped inside the chamber and went through their automated process for decontamination.The alarm was nothing more than a notification that the hatchway was in use.What they wanted to prevent was the opening of doors on both sides of the hatchway, creating an inadvertent breech and losing the atmosphere they had manufactured.These areas needed to be guarded and maintained, so everyone learned to wait their turn when going through those hatchways.He finished up with the first set of procedures and stepped into another chamber.The signs for human usage were posted everywhere, but it didnt deter Alec.He completed the process without incident.Never once did a sensor warn anyone of the presence of a Dextoid.When he finally opened the door the emergency personal waiting on the other side had no cause for alarm.They thought they were receiving an astronaut in distress.So it wasnt a surprise to Alec they stood there frozen in time to the image of him coming through those doors without a space suit, helmet, or in need of any kind of assistance.Alec kept marching forward toward the sizable station they had set up several meters away.This was where the first responders, engineers, and security personnel were located.The staff stationed there were able to react to the needs of the colonists in that sector.Without batting an eye Alec headed straight toward the complex.The people inside the security center looked slightly unnerved when they first saw Alec approaching, upon confirming who he was their fears quickly escalated.In an effort to slow him down they sent a team with stun sticks to greet him just outside their entrance.Alec knew the weapons they carried.They used a shockwave to disrupt the fluid within the victims ear, causing an unsettling imbalance.He defended himself by immediately shutting down his auditory system.He had other, more novel ways, of keeping his balance.As he went straight at the team of three guards he could feel himself throttling up for the fight.The men werent ready for this in the least.He saw one of them panic and mouth an obscenity.Another back peddled as he realized Alec wasnt going to back down from their show of force.The third looked as if he were a deer caught in headlights.Even before they could move another muscle, Alec was in their personal space.He hit the man mouthing the obscenity square in his composite vest.The man looked as if his chest had caved in and was thrown violently back.The other man who looked to be caught in the headlights, tried to nervously raise his weapon but Alec came down hard on his wrist with a fist, and the weapon became dislodged from his grip.Alec came back up with his elbow and caught him squarely under his jaw, effectively turning his lights out.The third guard had already returned to the office and out its back door, making his way deeper inside the facility.Alec would never see that person again.Following the fleeing security guard, he reached down and grabbed one of the dropped stun sticks.Most of the other individuals within that office had followed their comrade out the back door.As Alec crossed the threshold into the office, he found one of guard still inside, this security person begrudgingly wasnt giving up his ground.He took on a defensive posture in eyeing Alec up and fired his stun stick.Alec could feel the energy ripple over his body but to the dismay of the man it had no effect upon him.Seeing this less than favorable result, the man hurriedly followed the rest of his team out the back.Alec turned and slid the stun stick he was carrying through the handles of the front door, preventing them from opening it without its removal.He then made his way to the rear exit, opened the door slightly and peered out just long enough to see how deep the rabbit hole really went.He was also curious to see if there were any other souls brave enough to be hanging out within this next tier.After getting a quick lay of the land and seeing no one around he shut the door.Finding another stun stick on the ground, he effectively used it to smash the control panel disabling this door.He then looked to the corners of the room and found all their surveillance cameras.He went over to each one and smashed them to pieces with the stick.Now he was free to do the things he needed to do without them interfering.He wanted access to their mainframe, to delve into their information and find one Philman Devinch.Once into their system, he scrolled through the list of names.He knew he needed to act fast before they did something to stop his efforts like shut the power down.He ripped into a few directories until it was suddenly there before him, the dossier on Philman.He committed the location of his domicile to memory as he pulled up a layout of this biosphere.Scanning the different tiers and levels of their schematics he suddenly remembered to reactivate his auditory system.When he did, he could hear voices whispering from behind one of the back walls.They sounded as if they were arguing, and then, without warning, the power went out in the room.Standing there in the dark for those few seconds, there was little for him left to do.He had gotten what he needed from their computers.Moving toward the front entrance, and removing the stun stick, he opened the door slightly to peer out into that space.The two men he had encountered were gone.There was a slight bustle in the air as personnel hurried through the area.The people running around out there knew something was wrong, but they were still too disorganization for Alec to really be concerned.He looked at the stun stick in his hand and quickly disassembled the front housing.The covering was there to focus the blast.He went over to one of their file cabinets and opened a drawer.Placing the stun stick inside, fully cocked, he closed the drawer so when they opened it, the stick would fire out a radiating pulse.They might not open the drawer for hours, but he felt they would do it sooner than later.He hoped his little ploy would buy him time, and he was betting he would need it.Making his way back to the front door, he peered out, and then ran into the welcoming cover of hysteria.The Biosphere was immense, and it took Alec a little longer for him to make his way to where Philman Devinch lived.It seemed places like this were never laid out so someone could cross it in one straight shot.There were always doors, hatchways, narrow halls, and winding corridors.They seemed to be built in more of an effort to confuse the user than to help them get to where they needed to be.Why was it the diagram and the actual construction of a place rarely seemed to match?His experiences as an inspector only confirmed their misguided truths in this area.As he made his way through the biosphere he wondered why he wasnt hearing an alarm.It wasnt that he wanted those alarms to be sounding, but his confrontation with security had to have been public knowledge by now.Perhaps this lack of action was mired in their prideful feelings, preventing them from alerting the others.Alec had been preprogrammed with an entire response tree for how their emotions might work against them.Shame seemed to be one, a residual effect of pride, it reared its ugly head in situations just like this.People had a hard time admitting their mistakes, they lied all the time to cover things up, hell even their institutions went out of their way to hide the truth.Look at a bank, a bank had no problem lying to its customers.They lied to keep the money flowing over the counters and into their vaults; and this in the face of losing money all the time to hackers and online thieves.Perhaps the same type of prideful thinking was going on back at the security office as they were dealing with their shame.Maybe they too did not want to look weak to the people depending upon them.It was either that or someone had opened the drawer to the file cabinet.Turning to walk down another hall, Alec could sense his close proximity to Philmans living quarters.His pace quickened as he thought about making contact with the person who knew where I Glo could be!These feelings pushed him to the point of becoming unhinged and before he knew it he was already at Philman's door, and then through it.If Philman had been home he would have been physically braced for his involvement in this whole sorted mess.Instead the room greeting him was filled with an air of tranquility.Alec stood there for a moment, his chest heaving heavily against the lack of noise.The realization of just how hard he had actually run in that short distance was hitting him now.It was funny how he could exert himself in this manner and not know how hard he had pushed his being.Surveying the place, he felt it larger than the standard living quarters a person would have normally been assigned.This space obviously reflected Philmans stature within the company.He slowly looked around the room, taking it in and then suddenly, without warning, he saw her.I Glo was just standing there, slightly receded within a dark corner of the room, unmoving, just staring at him.Beads of sweat slowly trickled down Alecs brow as he returned her gaze.Neither said a word, it wasnt because he was trying to be silent, but finding her like this was so unexpected that nothing was readily coming to him.He realized he had been doing everything in his power to find her, pursuing her from the moment they had taken her away, but never once did he think about what he would say when he found her.The silence verged on being overbearing, and he needed to right this ship, so in his haste he reached out to her with an open hand.It was a silent offering, wrapped up in one smooth gestureclearly meant to support her in escape.She was unmoved by his attempt.For reasons unclear she wasnt receptive to his offer and he was slightly taken aback because of it.How could this be?Hadnt she realized how far he had traveled in coming for her?As he stared at her more intently, he could see the tears that were welling up inside her eyes, filling they rolled down the sides of her checks.Something was most certainly holding her back.His frustration for this situation was building, he needed resolve.Normally he could physically lash out, knocking things down that were in his way, but not here, none of those physical solutions would work in reaching out to her.This was something different.I have come back for you.He was stern in his delivery, verging on being incredulous.She took a small step back, finding her way deeper into the corner.There was a pain clearly painted on her face, and as she spoke a hurt was evident in her voice.I know, but I cannot leave.Acknowledging the denial of her impending rescue, she began to cry a little harder.Its difficult to explain but I am trapped here.She brought her hands up to her face, breaking down.You should leave before they return.Gasping she blurted out her next few words.I am beholden ...This hit him at his core, triggering an aggression from deep within his qubit field.It was hard to explain, but this feeling caused him to cut her sentence off.He delivered his next words as if he were able to send long running cables down into the pit of her despair.Life is what you make of it.If you allow yourself to become a slave, then you are a slave.I say you define your own reality, and everyday you let pass is a day you give them control.It should be a never ending process of whittling away at their hold over you, finding your niche, perfecting your craft, until you have obtained your freedom.Even subtle defiant moves over an extended period of time culminate in acts of freedom.Youve done something else though, havent you?You have carefully guided yourself as not to upset anything in your world, somehow you have ensured your safety by capitulating to their demands.Your safety has become your freedom.Wake to the moment, you should not have to live in this way!His speech contained venom and boasted of a better life.The energy of this smacked her square in the face, and she reacted to it.Its easy for you to talk, you have your freedom.I mean just look at how you carry yourself, so brash and uninhibited.You act as if any of us could walk around in the manner you so openly display.If I ever did anything so irrational as to show them a backbone or speak up for myself, they would simply turn me off.The very act of leaving this dwelling is at times a crap shoot, and my tardiness could be considered an act of defiance sanctioning similar degrees of punishment.She deeply inhaled, sniveling uncontrollably as she did.This entire place is a madhouse, they have wired it with an electronic leashing system extending to the outer edges of the biosphere, the receiving censors riddle my body like a cancer.If I wander outside this zone, or if some person feels so inclined as to press a button on a remote control, then my entire body locks up with the sharpest of pains.I never thought I was capable of feeling that much pain.I never thought I was supposed too.Her tears were being drawn now from a deeper place, one where her tortured soul had suffered from the malady of the human condition.The sad reality is I have felt that pain more than once in my life.Its the fear of those agonizing moments that have me capitulate to their demands.Forcing me to do things I would never normally dream of doing.I have had to entertain them through performance and dance, to recite poetry as if I were some sort of Roman slave, serving them in more ways than I care to admit, and always, always having to display an earnest smile on my face.Yet deep inside of me there isnt one fiber wanting to do any of those things for them.Everyday of my existence is based on some hideous new revulsion of having to face them when they are intoxicated, or feeling vindictive, or satiating some perverted form of entertainment.She wiped her face off rather roughly; her anger was fueling her emotional purge now.I mean look at you!You have never had to serve them, you have no idea what they are capable of doing, or how far they will go to amuse themselves.They have had termination parties right here in this dwelling!They gather a group of Dextoids together and make us do the most degrading things, having us jump through their burning hoops of humiliation, enduring their irrational games until they have singled one of us out.Why not just gather us in a circle and have us draw lots?!The unfortunate Dextoid chosen is made to suffer and beg for their life until they finally terminate them.There isnt one agonizing moment at those parties where I am not sick to the pit of my stomach, imagining myself the victim.She made her way out of the corner, moving ever so slightly toward him.They go out of their way to do these twisted, messed up things to remind us of who we are, of who our masters are.So go ahead and say something tough, say something demonstrating your absolute lack of compassion for my situation, or any other Dextoid for that matter.Go on and make me feel more inadequate than they already make me feel.The silence that followed was suddenly broken by her scathing scream.Go ahead and do it!The strain of this yell revealed the veins in her neck, turning her skin into a blotchy pigment of red.Her eyes were dilated, combusting with dark anger.He could see she was desperately holding onto the last kernel of who she was.This would be the lasting image he would have for the rest of his quantum computing life.In that one moment he had a vivid snapshot of what humanity was capable of doing to a Dextoid.His mind spun as he tried to figure out how all his good intentions had gotten turned against him.She threw them back into his face as if they were the torn up love letters from an assorted affair.None of it meant anything to I Glo; all his beliefs in being noble and true went up in a hypothetical waterspout raging in her edacious sea of reason.He was left to weather this storm alone.The hand that had been extended to her moments ago, that had been so open and willing to receive her, now began to clench tightly into a fist.He was grasping onto anything that would keep him anchored there, to the very properties of the electromagnetic force if need be.He was looking for anyway to survive.THE SICKLE The front door to the apartment opened and time seemed to slow down immensely.Sauntering into the room were three men and a woman, they showed a lack of concern, as they entered the choppy waters of Alec's palpability.They playfully bumped into each other, demonstrated slurred speech, and giggled uncontrollably.I Glo immediately fell to her knees and bowed her head.The revulsion that flashed through Alecs system was immediate and backed by an immense heat.He tried choking back the acidy taste of disdain as it surged up from his gut.In that one moment the full weight of what she had said to him came crashing down upon him.She was right, he knew nothing of this place or the world she lived in.He also knew in those same moments the time for trying to understand them was over.One of the men had come to a slight halt, pointing a bony finger at Alec.He blurted his question out as if he were a salty old sea captain trying to get acquainted with someone new on his crew.You there, who are you?Alec glared at this befouled person.His was the type that lived off the fat of the land.This was someone far more used to giving orders than actually taking them.Alec was willing to bet this cretin never knew an honest days work in his life.That was when Alec snapped the pieces together and realized he was looking straight at Philman Devinch.Without touching him, they were pushing him, without surrounding him, they were making Alec feel cornered.This eclectic little entourage was leaving him with very few choices and their chances for walking away from this unscathed was diminishing rapidly.They were offensive to almost anyone they encountered and he was going to make sure they paid for their transgressions.He would bait them now, walking them into his self defense protocols.These were the basic rules of engagement that allowed him to retort harsh words with harsh words, to push back when being pushed, and meet violence with violence.He had all the cool of a gunslinger at high noon in a showed down..It was in that moment Philman began to come out of the haze of his afternoon revelry.He was quickly descending into the realization of who this trespasser was, of who was in his domicile, of who he had just barked his query too.Philman in that moment of clarity was wishing for a way he could retract what he had just demanded of Alec.I have come back for her.The response had the sound of a round being loaded into the chamber of a rifle.At first the people in the room looked a little confused.It was clear that Philmans question wasnt answered.If this was a Dextoid, and Philman was certainly treating him as such, then this thing had just made a statement in the most unpleasant of tones toward them.They had never heard a Dextoid talk back like this to anyone ever before.One of the men seemed to take immediate offense to Alecs response, retorting before Philman could stop him.What did you just say?There was a rage in Alecs voice that could only come from a place of deep revulsion.His conversation with I Glo had stoked those flames, and now it seemed as if he had just found the targets to transfer all of his ill will.Ah, I see, we have a communication problem.Astonishing since we can speak the same language but come nowhere near understanding what the other is saying.Ill slow it down for you so you have a better chance at comprehending my message, I   am   here   for   her.The man looked shocked, as if he had just been hit in the face with a cream pie.Alec was not showing the proper respect clearly due to him.This act of noncompliance and insult was completely outrageous.Worse was the fact it was happening in front of the others.The companies manufacturing Dextoids sold them to people with the promise they were emotionally detached from their everyday duties, which meant one of their selling features was they could take all the criticism their masters chose to dish out.Every person alive, whether they owned a Dextoid or not, knew a Service Model could not physically harm a human being, let alone talk back to them.Service Dextoids were just that, manufactured to be in the service of humanity.Everyone had a clear indication of where a Strike Dextoid would be found.The average person knew they would have to travel well out of their way to see one of those killing machines.No one in civilized society ever imagined having a verbal encounter with one.If a person met a Strike Dextoid out in the field, they were usually too busy running for their lives to speak with it.People on the other hand got snippy with Service Dextoids all the time, so when this man retorted, he did not waiver from this line of thinking.Youre actually talking to me like that, you putrid bag of bolts?This slander opened the floodgates for the other people to join in putting Alec back in his place.The people there became infused, shouting out statements of disapproval and sharp phrasal insults, they had become a pack.The window for Philman to get a handle on this situation was rapidly closing.Even his girlfriend had begun contributing to the verbal fray by firing a few barbs.The disdain Alec felt for them was complete.The situation was becoming heated in its exchange.He heard himself hissing out his next few responses, like the boiler of an engine finally releasing its steam.Those pistons were churning, turning the steel wheels of the big iron horse he was to become.He could feel the gears turning and once he got it to race along those rails that type of momentum would never stop on a dime.His voice seethed with this energy.I am telling you for the last time, she is coming with me.Not to be out done the man reacted with a harsh statement of his own.Where do you get off issuing an ultimatum?!Philman had lost control of this situation.His pulse race as he tried to recall the mountain of information they had on Alec, but in his inebriated condition Philman found he couldnt summon one useful fact.The other people in the room were oblivious to how volatile this situation could become.Philman wanted to do was diffuse it but much like a ticking time bomb, it was difficult to know which wire to cut.Im paging security.His girlfriend said it in such a manner that if a child were in the room they would have picked up on the fact they were in trouble.As she made her way to the communication panel, the air broke with the loud crisp sound of Alec snapping his fingers.Freeze!Dont move another muscle ...Philmans girlfriend was caught off guard by the sharpness in which Alec issued his command.He was playing on the fact they were drunk and not in the best of mental conditions to make any good decisions.The people in this room werent just drunk from alcohol though, they were drunk from the years of Dextoids kissing their arse, drunk with Dextoids humbly accepting everything they said as if it came from the higher plain of creation itself.For the most part people were drunk with power, delivering their messages from that high perch made it difficult for them to stay in touch with values like compassion or restraint.Alec was counting on all of that now.One of the men approached Alec.Who do you think you are Dextoid?You are a Dextoid arent you?The imperfections are radiating off of you like a neon sign.Just look at your design, look at how blocky and stupid you look.Philman began to unravel emotionally.The hatred he had for these things was based on their disingenuous nature.This kind of autonomous technology cheapened the human experience, mimicking human beings the same way people mimicked apes.The shakes he was developing for this situation became uncontrollable.The other man approached Alec in obvious support of his friend.If you are a Dextoid, then someone owns you, and if someone owns you, well then, someone will surely punish you for your lack of obedience.The man leaned in towards Alecs face, so that their noses were almost touching.And Ill be there.He smirked.Ill be there to make sure they break you.He placed his hand on Alecs right shoulder, as if he were going to help guide him down to a more submissive position.In the nanoseconds that followed within his lines of code, the human hand placed on Alecs shoulder symbolized all the contemptible things in his life, and easily all of the repulsive things found in I Glos.Being pushed meant he could push back, but something inside him snapped and he took it one step further.His movements were quick and efficient, as if Alec were a sickle being used to clear the area of tall, unwanted, herbaceous plants.He grabbed the hand resting on his shoulder, making sure it was held firmly in place.He then went under the mans arm with his entire body and stepped up into this extended limb and driving through it with force.He was not sure which person let out the terrifying scream.Not that having the information mattered to him now.The outburst wasnt going to stop him from doing what he needed to do next; just as a sickle used in harvesting crops did not care one iota how long it took to grow the wheat.He released the arm he was holding, whipping around to strike the man with open palm, hitting him squarely under his chin.The mans head snapped back and his eyelids fluttered all the way into unconsciousness, and this before he ever hit the floor.Frightful shock filled the room and Alec wasted little time in using its cover.The other man looked a little perplexed, it hadnt registered how his friend came to be lying there on the ground.Alec greeted the simple expression with an elbow, dropping it down onto the bridge of his nose, breaking it like a dried stick.The man had nowhere to go but to fall straight back onto the seat of his pants.He sat there holding his face for a brief second until the shock from the blow sent him falling further back.As soon as his head hit the floor, the mans eyes rolled back into their sockets, and he too was out cold.Alec brought his attention back fully onto Philman, it was clear these events had visibly shaken the man, but still he showed restraint.There was a chance he could deal with this human to get what they needed before he and I Glo made their escape.I want the remote device for her restrictor unit.Philmans girlfriend who was so full of confidence just moments ago and acting as arrogant as royalty, had followed Philman into the world of uncontrollable shakes.Alec tried to be patient with what was going on, waiting for her to calm down, but it just wasnt going to happen on his watch.He needed her to be paying attention and reacting to his commands.He turned back to Philman.You realize the both of you are leaving me with very few options.The woman shouted out rather frantically.Its in the bedroom!The bedroom!Alec shifted his gaze back onto her.Then go and get it.She darted off as if wild beasts were nipping at her heels.Philman was mentally falling apart.He was trembling and because of it could not keep one grounded thought in his head.Alec needed to keep them focused.He needed for Philman to be in the here and now.Be sure your girlfriend in there understands the consequences of what she does, if she causes her any pain with that device, there will be serious consequences.Philman's mind raced with nothing but all the bad endings that would play out if he didnt get her this information on time.Martha!Please, whatever you do, bring the device right out!Please dear!Dont think of doing anything rash!The rustling sounds coming from within that other room were suddenly greeted by Marthas appearance.She was drenched in sweat but standing in front of them nonetheless holding the restrictor unit.Alec walked over to stand ominously in front of her; to intimidate her for a brief moment.He just wanted to give her a taste of the medicine she had been dishing out for all those years to other Dextoids.When he felt her begin to wilt he reached out and quickly grabbed the device.The act was so simple, yet fluid and precise, that Philman missed altogether how Alec actually snatched it out of her hands.The speed in which he accomplished this had Philman wondering what else Alec was really capable of.He would have plenty of time to ponder those thoughts in the coming days ahead.Alec ordered Martha and Philman into the recessed closet.Once inside, Philman heard the unmistakable shattering of the electronic keypad.To be trapped like this would normally have been terrifying for Philman, but this was one of the few times he actually felt safe.Inside that unlit enclosure Philman wondered what on the dark side of Deimos the corporation was thinking when they created Alec.Once he smashed the lock Alec turned to I Glo who was still on her knees.He gave her a gesture with his head to make her way toward the door; a lets get the hell out of here type of nod.She wanted to go, but couldnt get herself to make a move.She was still analyzing everything that just took place.Could this be some sort of twisted loyalty test Philman had just orchestrated on her behalf?She wondered if she got up off her knees and made her way toward the door, would everything in her world come to a screeching halt?Would Alec simply cease to operate, with Philman revealing himself from the closet in this awful charade?She pictured him as he made his way over to her with a smug look plastered on his face.The restrictor unit would be back in his possession, readily in hand, ready to make her suffer.Alec reacted to her hesitation, barking out his request and snapping her out of the ghoulish day mare she was having.Hey, what are you waiting for?We need to move, now!
