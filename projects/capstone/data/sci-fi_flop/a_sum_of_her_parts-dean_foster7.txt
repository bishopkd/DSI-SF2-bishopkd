Mols curiosity concerning his new surroundings extended only to a characteristic need to map them in his head.He did not care what the facilities were used for, was uninterested in the motivations of the many Naturals and Melds who bustled around him.He was here on specific company business.The rest of company business did not concern him.Diversions were for when his task was done.They descended one floor in a massive lift large enough to hold a dozen people and several vehicles.More walking and more corridors brought them to a second lift.This one was considerably smaller and descended a good deal farther.Exiting down another hallway eventually brought them to a double door flanked by two guards.Both were large lods hefting large weapons.Mol identified the guns at a glance, casually noting with approval that both were powerful fast firing contemporary models that would be well suited to defending a subterranean corridor.The escort identified himself to the guards, who in turn identified him to the door.A feminine voice responded via a speaker and the doors parted with a click to admit the visitors.The paired barriers were thick, fireproof, and probably capable of stopping anything up to and including an armor piercing military round.A curving desk in the reception area was staffed by a woman in her early thirties.She appeared to be a Natural, though Mol knew better than most how external appearances could be deceiving.Hovering off to one side between a pair of purple couches, a floating holovit whose volume had been turned way down was showing the most recent episode of a popular folk drama from Madagascar.The receptionist looked up from her box screen.Napun Mol?He nodded and she smiled, showing none of the instinctive disdain that had initially been displayed by his younger escort.Youre expected.Go right in.A single door nearby slid aside and Mol stepped through the portal.As he did so it scanned him, even though he had long since been cleared through an assortment of checkpoints.When his escort moved to follow, the woman spoke pleasantly but firmly.Not you.It was a measure of the womans tone, or Krugers status, or perhaps both, that the formerly self confident young man did not try to argue with her.Turning, he departed wordlessly back the way he had come.The outer doors slid silently shut behind him.Krugers office featured one full vit wall that was presently displaying a live three dimensional projection from St.Marks Square.Excited tourists mingled with locals while a tenor outside the oldest caf in Italy strove manfully to project Puccini above the babble of several dozen tongues.Beneath the transparent pavers that were part of Ascended Venice, the waters of the Grand Canal surged restlessly, stirred by passing vaporetto.Wandering into the foreground and indifferent to the presence of the global box or local police pickups, a pickpocket casually riffled a wallet from a womans purse.The unjudgmental Mol noted that the man wore a live fluctuator on his wrist.Disguised to look like a cheap chrono, its signal would cancel out the proximity alarm embedded in the stolen wallet, rendering it useless.So went the eternal war between the ever innocent and the always opportunistic.Kruger noted the direction of his visitors gaze.Youve been to Venice?Yes, Mol murmured longingly, Ive been to Venice.I was once witness to a drowning that took place there.The poor fellow ended up in a canal and I was compelled to perform CPT on him.The security chief frowned.Dont you mean CPR?No.Mol smiled thinly.CPT.Cardiopulmonary termination.Without changing tone or expression he added, I like cities in general.It is where I am most comfortable.City people are generally accommodating of the elderly.Kruger nodded without comment, tracking his guest carefully as the old man settled himself into the chair on the other side of the desk.You dont move like you need that cane youre carrying.Kind of you to say so.I manage my affairs well enough.Unlike you, it would seem.Kruger instantly dispensed with the false conviviality he was obliged to display toward visitors.From here onward their conversation would proceed on a purely professional plane.That suited him just fine.Whats that supposed to mean?Mol had draped the cane across his lap.I was informed that you recently lost some of your people here.The security chief stiffened in his chair.An unfortunate incident involving unexpected hostiles that took place far outside the facility.Procedures are in place to ensure it wont happen again.Its nothing that need concern an independent contractor like yourselfcolleague.Mol smiled afresh.I meant no offense.You couldve fooled me.Seriously, I do not.I am merely curious from a professional standpoint.Speaking professionally, I am sure that you recall our conversation of some weeks ago.Well enough.Still only partly mollified, Kruger leaned back in his chair.I replayed it when I was told that you were coming.I wish I could say that I was looking forward to this, but I dislike interruptions to routine.Where that is concerned we are of the same mindcolleague.Kruger felt a bit better about his guest.I was expecting someone Younger?Mol finished for him.Kruger nodded.And larger.His own smile was flat.Merely from a professional standpoint, you understand.Without taking his eyes off his visitor he addressed a concealed pickup.Danae, will you come in here a minute, please?Mol did not react as the door behind him slid open to admit the receptionist.When she stopped very close to his left side and leaned toward him he was compelled to take closer notice of her.Ylang ylang based perfume assailed his nostrils.Resting her hands on her knees, she locked pale blue eyes with his.Her voice was a trill composed to run up and down specific parts of a mans body.Is there anything I can get you, Mr.Mol?Anything at all?In situations like this I am always at a guests disposal.Watching from the other side of the desk Kruger said nothing, his expression unreadable.Mol met her gaze without flinching, without blinking.Tempted as I am by your practiced offer I believe you would find my personal predilections unpalatable, Ms.Danae.You are quite striking and you have excellent breasts and fine hips.I also note that the power mister situated between the former is doubtless loaded with a suitably potent soporific.I would suggest replacing it with a smaller and less prominent model.Her expression fell and he smiled.Less volume but less detectable is better.The same goes for the flistol strapped to your attractive and well toned right thigh.Too much bulge.She straightened and her winsome smile vanished.No one else ever noticed them.No, that is not necessarily correct, he challenged her.What you mean to say is that no one else has commented on them.That does not mean they have gone unnoticed.Something not commented upon does not cease to exist.This, for example.His hand shot out and grabbed her between the legs.Shocked, she immediately brought her right hand down sharply, the edge aiming for his neck.Parrying the blow easily with his left hand, the right swung the cane upward.The tip, from which a needle now protruded, halted less than a centimeter from her left eye.She froze.It was dead silent in the room.Folding his hands on the desk in front of him, Kruger said quietly, Thatll be all for now, Danae.Backing away from the visitor, the receptionist grabbed her throbbing wrist with her other hand, nodded, and retreated to the outer reception area.While the door closed behind her, Mol turned nonchalantly back to his host.As the monitors concealed beneath the top of the security chiefs desk indicated, the visitors respiration and heart rate were unchanged.Shes fast.And she is decorative.A useful tool, but she needs to learn how to deal with both criticism and the unexpected.Kruger shook his head.I think, Mr.Mol, that you are a little more unexpected than anything she has encountered before.Ill speak to her about the concealed weapons.Mol nodded.As tests of my competency go, that was relatively unstressful.You must understand that at my age women are at best a diversion, not an inducement.I trust there will be no more games.Why have you come here?Thats better.Pleased to have the discussion back on a purely professional level, Mol settled back into the chair.Nearly disappeared into it, Kruger thought.I have come to await the conclusion of an assignment that has already taken far too long.Kruger remembered their phone conversation.The two thieves you spoke about.The ones you said had stolen a small storage thread that belongs to the company.If I recall correctly you said you had reason to believe they might be in Southern Africa.His eyes widened slightly.You dont mean to say that you think theyre somewhere around here?Mol nodded.I mean to say exactly that.Wunderbaarlik.Well, if theyre anywhere in the Sperrgebeit either my patrols or our programmed searchers will find them.I assure you that if theyre within two hundred kilometers of Nerens theyll be located and picked up.These are very resourceful people.Because theyve managed to avoid you for so long?Mol twitched ever so faintly at the slight, but not so faintly that Kruger failed to note the reaction.Good, he thought.That should even up the nonoffensive commentary a bit.It is astounding what the most ordinary people can do if sufficiently motivated, the visitor responded calmly.By subsist, by a desire for power, by sex.Although from what I have learned I do not think the last motivator applies in this instance.It is true that I thought I had successfully run these people to ground previously.Twice, in fact.On each occasion they managed to escape me.They will not this time.Kruger was on firm ground now.Not if they come anywhere near my security perimeter they wont.Mol leaned slightly forward.Despite himself Krugers right hand moved surreptitiously toward a desk drawer when the tip of the unprepossessing cane appeared to incline in his direction.Neither man commented on the security chiefs instinctive reaction.Indeed, Mol would have been disappointed had Kruger not reacted.Your confidence is reassuring but possibly misplaced.Belying their backgrounds, these two have managed to elude not only myself but others who would like to take possession of the storage thread.Its significance cannot be overemphasized nor its importance to the company overstressed.All right, all right; I get it, Mr.Mol.This thread is important and these people are tricky.His heavy eyebrows drew together slightly.If you dont mind my asking, if theyve stolen something thats so valuable to the company, why on Earth would they try to bring it here, where company security is as tight as anywhere on the planet?Of that I am not sure.But having had more time than I wish to consider all the possibilities, I believe they are coming in hopes of learning what is on the thread.They cannot sell it, for example to those other interested parties to whom I just referred, without knowing what it contains.I cannot imagine any other reason for taking such risks as they already have.Kruger nodded.That makes a certain twisted sense.To a crazy person.They are not crazy, Mol assured his host.They are driven.These are not always so very different.Their motivation is immaterial to me.If they enter the Sperrgebeit theyll be detected and picked up.And if their intent is to try and slip into Nerens itself, the closer they come the tighter theyll find security.He smiled, ready to relax.Meanwhile, you must be tired from your trip.Bouncing all the way from the Cape to the Namib isnt my idea of a peaceful journey.He nodded suggestively toward the door that led to the reception area.You sure you dont want Danae to show you the ropes?Mol smiled back.It was different from his earlier smiles.Not unless you already have someone else in mind for the vacancy she would leave.Het Kruger was not a man whose blood was easily chilled.But with a single expression the old man seated in the big chair before him had managed to lower the temperature in the office by several degrees.The Sum of Her Parts     11 From what Ingrid could remember of Ouspels map and directions Gwi followed a similar though not identical route.After days of struggling through the hostile desert landscape on their own it was almost relaxing to have an actual live guide.That he talked occasionally at night but hardly at all during the day had nothing to do with shyness.SICK searchers listen as well as look, he told her when she inquired as to the reason for his persistent silences.They were traveling almost due west now.Whenever Whispr would question if they were headed in the right direction Gwi would point out a landmark that was familiar to him.Most of what he singled out for attention did not look like landmarks to Ingrid: a twist in a dry riverbed, a single lonely kokerboom tree, the way two hillside slopes came together to form a particular angle: sometimes their guides landmark consisted of nothing more than a discoloration underfoot.All were road signs to the young San.They were very close to Nerens when he bade them stop and crouch down behind a sandy hillock.A few twisted sprigs of Sarcocaulon pattersonii, better known as bushmens candle, held forth against the wind from the crest of the sandy bulge.Ingrid looked around anxiously.I dont see anything.Whats wrong?As he swung his small pack off his back and began fumbling within, Gwi put a finger to his lips.Forget your eyes, he told her.Listen.She went silent.An irritated Whispr was about to say something when the sound of distant laughter made him pause.Hints of hilarity odd in timbre, it was deep and drawing near.Staying on his belly, he scrambled to the top of the hillock and peered into the distance, trying to locate the source of the ongoing incongruous merriment.Several minutes elapsed before he could, at the absolute limit of his vision, make out a dozen or so shapes running toward them.Not, not running, he corrected himself.Loping.Spotted hyenas.Magified melds.Components of Nerens security.Gwi whispered tightly without looking up from working with the contents of his pack.Removing a small cylindrical shape from a package, he carefully unfolded its wings, tail, and propeller, locking them in place.Whispr admired the result.Model airplane?Youre going to fight maniped carnivores with a model airplane?Maybe he has a model bomb.Ingrid no longer had to strain to pick up the excited yapping of the oncoming predators, who made up for their awkward gait with surprising speed and unsurpassed endurance.No bomb.Another transparent plastic container he took from his pack contained half a dozen capsules.Flicking open the containers cap he carefully removed one of the pills, snapped the container shut, and replaced it inside his pack.As Ingrid watched he opened a compartment in the underside of the toy plane, slipped the capsule inside, and snapped the lid shut.The deep throated coughing laughter of the hyenas was very loud now.Whispr eyed their guide meaningfully.You better have a gun to go with that toy.I work in sanitation, my friend.No one at the facility is allowed to have weapons except Security personnel.But I have this.Using the hillock for concealment he shifted onto his knees and held the small drone high in his right hand.Ingrid was trying hard not to panic.Being picked up by and having to try to explain themselves to SICK security was one thing; what the patrolling carnivore melds might do to them quite another.With a person, even a lod, you could reason.But magified hyenas I am going to release this on three, Gwi whispered.Before I say three you should take a deep breath, cover your mouth and nose, and try to hold your breath as long as you can.I dont underst, she began.There was no time to explain even had the San been so inclined.The howling of the pack was nearly upon them.One, twotheir guide inhaled deeplythree!On three he released the drone.Propeller whirring, engine whining softly, it promptly shot off at high speed directly toward the oncoming pack.Within moments it had begun to release a vapor from its underside.Too flustered to prepare properly, Ingrid forgot their guides admonition and took in a breath through her nose.The stench that assailed her nostrils and sinus cavities hit her insides like a shot of zero gravity.As she fell forward, cheeks bulging, Gwi threw himself on top of her.Divining the Sans purpose and still holding his own breath, Whispr joined him.Together their two bodies managed to smother most of the sound of the doctors retching.They laid thus for more than a minute, at which point the struggling Whispr had to gulp air.To his great relief he found that much of the stench had cleared off.So had something else.The maniacal braying of the pack of magified hyenas was receding rapidly into the distance.In another moment it was gone completely.Sucking fresh air like a diver surfacing on an empty tank, Ingrid rolled over and wiped at her mouth.Whisprs short lived gallantry did not extend to helping her clean herself.Im sorry, she sputtered, her expression twisting in disgust.It all happened so fast.Sitting up and still wiping at herself, she coughed and spat.What waswhat did you do?Turning slightly to her left she listened intently, but of the hysterical choir of approaching four footed death there was no sound.What about the hyenas?Running for their kennel, I should think.Gwi was rearranging the contents of his pack.The drone is a simple, inexpensive toy one can purchase anywhere.I like it because it is wholly mechanical.It is powered by compressed gas and made of maize derived organic polymers.When it runs out of fuel it will land itself.Eventually it will disintegrate under the force of the elements.With the exception of the small gas cylinder that will quickly be covered by blowing sand there will be nothing for a searcher to find.But the smell She put her hand over her mouth as mere memory of the noxious odor threatened to once more overwhelm her insides.The drone is an antique model of what used to be called, I think, a crop duster.It is designed to spray a fine mist of water.The capsule I loaded into it is filled with something different.Essence of skunk?theorized a curiousand gratefulWhispr.Gwi shook his head.Lion urine, concentrated about fifty times.For the first time since the ominous chortling of the pack had been heard he allowed himself to smile.Traditional enemy of all hyenas.At that concentration the Melds must have thought they were coming up on a lion the size of an elephant.Turning, he crawled swiftly to the crest of the mound.Gone.Out of sight.Still running, I am sure.They will run all the way back to the Security kennel.He stood and beckoned.Come.If we move fast we will be able to reach the facility by midnight.That will be an excellent time to enter.Ingrid would happily have forked over several hundred for a change of clothing.As that was not to be had, she made herself rise and start off in the guides wake.She had to content herself with the fact that she did not smell anywhere near as bad as the horrible concoction that A thought caused her to put her own sorry hygiene out of her mind.Gwi?Tell me: where does one get highly concentrated lion urine?Before the San could reply Whispr interrupted with a question of his own.Never mind where.Striding alongside their guide he leaned over to catch the younger mans attention.How do you get concentrated lion urine?And I swear, sandman, if you say very carefully, I will personally snap one of those capsules under your nose.Gwi told them.The explanation made perfect sense to Ingrid.But then, she was a doctor.IT WAS SO DARK that she could barely see the crouching shape of the San in front of her.In such reduced light Whisprs slenderness rendered him almost invisible.She was convinced that if any of them was going to show up on a security monitor it would be her own recently maniped self.But no harsh spotlights sprang to life to blind her and no voices, human or magified, called out to them in the darkness.They were almost to the access well.We should have been spotted long ago.As he paralleled their guide Whispr could not keep from marveling at the lack of attention.I would have thought security here would be impenetrable.They halted beside the metal cylinder.Thrice Whisprs height, it looked to Ingrid as if a smokestack had been removed from an ancient steamship and plunked down in the middle of the desert.Even in the darkness she could see that it had been painted to exactly match the surrounding terrain.In the distance, still farther to the west, a few lights were visible.There is every kind of security you can imagine.Removing an electronic tablet from his pack Gwi held it up to the softly glowing oval seal that was set hip height flush into the curved side of the cylinder.He interrupted the process of entering code only to glance briefly at his chrono.But everything at Nerens is self contained and self sustaining.It has to be.There is no connection to an external grid.There is no grid to connect to for hundreds of kilometers.So every sector operates on an individual sequence.Each sector requires between two and three minutes to cycle between power sources, during which time it is down.Receiving, aircraft monitoring, climate control, sanitationeven Security.This always takes place late at night so as to inconvenience as little of the facilitys work and staff as possible.His fingers danced over the tablet he was holding.Whispr frowned.Id think Security, at least, would cover the couple of minutes of downtime by using some kind of backup power.One would think that, yes.But since no one has ever succeeded in breaking into Nerens and since outer perimeter security is considered impenetrable, the company does not seem worried about a couple of minutes of downtime in the middle of the Namib in the middle of the night.Perhaps the necessary switching to a backup source for a mere couple of minutes is more work than they wish to deal with.Even in a village, what is ordered by those at the top is not always put into practice by those at the bottom.When he smiled his teeth gleamed in the darkness.I break in and out all the time.So do several of my colleagues.We alternate our unscheduled holidays so that no more than one of us is away from the facility at any one time.No one misses you at work?a dubious Ingrid inquired.My colleagues cover my work for me.This is Nerens.The movements of visitors, of scientists and engineers, of security personnel and drivers, those are monitored very closely.No one pays attention to those who deal with the facilitys waste except others who deal with the facilitys waste.It is expected that we will keep tabs on one another.Mine is not a popular department to visit.The almost invisible door set in the side of the cylinder hummed softly as it slid noiselessly aside.Photostrips painted on the interior wall revealed a molded spiral staircase leading downward.A primitive solution to an internal transport problem, Ingrid reflected.She found its presence, in lieu of a lift, encouraging.The more technologically downscale the area they were infringing, the less likely it was to draw attention from internal security.It was very much the same as in a hospital.It was crowded with the three of them at the top of the stairwell.As the curved metal door slid shut behind them Gwi beckoned for them to follow as he started downward.He did not have to instruct them to descend quietly.Even so, Whispr could not resist asking one more question.You said the power was off to each sector for two to three minutes.What would have happened if we hadnt gotten inside before that time was up?Glancing back as he led the way downward their guides reply was a soft murmur.Most likely we would now be in custody of company security.Every alarm on the east side of the facility would have gone off at once.A somber Whispr digested this news.Just out of curiosity, how much time did we have left?Gwi smiled cheerfully back at him.About ten seconds, I think.No more talk for now, please.Whispr did not have to be told again.He was envisioning himself and Ingrid being thrown to the ground, wrapped in secure bands, and hauled off to the local version of a SICK interrogation chamber.Ten seconds Descending the steep staircase was not as bad as slip sliding over scree and rocks in Sanbona, but by the time the San raised a hand for them to halt, Ingrids knees and calves were throbbing from the effort.In the dim light and with her thoughts otherwise occupied she had not tried to calculate the distance they had come.She asked Whispr.More than a few stories and higher than hell.Thats the best I can guess.It doesnt matter.Spurts of adrenaline canceled out her exhaustion.We made it, Whispr.We did it!Were inside Nerens.Yay, he muttered flatly.Whoopee.We dont even know what part of the facility were in, except that its far belowground.Getting all the way from Savannah to here was the easy part.Now we have to get from here into the research center.I hope youre ready to play doctor, doc.She stiffened.I dont have to play doctor, Whispr.He sniffed.In lieu of confidence he would proffer fatalism.He found himself wishing for drugs.You know what I mean.Youre going to have to fool people into thinking youre part of the staff.Easier than trying to pass you off as a medical assistant.He smiled.I can be your ambulatory demonstration cadaver.You better hope I dont feel like demonstrating dissection.Wait here.Without further comment Gwi started off down a long, dim, high corridor.It was lined with pipes and conduits, some of them of sufficient diameter to easily pass a person down their length.Water dripped from several.A strange, foreign sensation began to drape itself, coatlike, over the waiting Ingrid.It took her a moment to identify it.She was cold.Here in the center of the worlds oldest desert, she was starting to shiver.The temperature did not seem to trouble Whispr.Thin as he was, he ought to have been feeling the chill even more.Maybe, she thought, his fear kept him warm.Minutes stretched into hours.They sat, they talked, she shivered, refusing to condescend to the obvious by asking Whispr to huddle close or to pull her thin thermosensitive blanket from her backpack lest they have to move in a hurry.She doubted his body gave off any more warmth than his personality anyway.Relief came in the form of sleep.Lying down on the floor and using her pack for a pillow she was just as cold, but she didnt feel it.Watching her reclining there Whispr was reminded of why he had come all this way.His participation had begun as a quest for subsist.That avarice remained, but along the way it had become laden with affection.Without his company, without his aid, this brilliant stupid woman would by now be dead ten times over.Youve always been a sucker for a nice body and a pretty face, he told himself.That was all it really was, surely: straightforward lust.For money and for flesh.The alternative was too terrible to contemplate.The possibility that he had fallen in love with her.These uncharacteristically warm thoughts were interrupted as a touch on his shoulder brought him back to consciousness.Blinking, he sat up in surprise.He had fallen asleep on the floor beside her.Scrambling to his feet, he adopted a defensive stance to confront the enemy.In the feeble light he made out a silhouette that was misshapen, lumpy, and short.He exhaled in relief when he saw that it was only Gwi.Their guide had finally returned to them, and his arms were full of clothes.As he dumped them on the floor a sleepy Ingrid awoke, rubbing at one eye.What isGwi, what have you got there?While her eyes focused she found herself recognizing a particular familiar design.Doctor clothing, I think.The San grinned proudly.You say you will pretend to be a facility doctor and this Meld your assistant.To make your gambit work you will need appropriate dressing.Here it is.He shrugged diffidently.I hope they fit.Whispr gawked at the garments.Where the hell did you get this stuff?From the general Laundry.He grinned.High security is not considered necessary for the Laundry department.Wide awake now, Ingrid was fingering the all white medical attire.The long overgown would certainly fit her.As for the too big pants, she would just have to pull them up as high under the overcoat as possible.Moving to the other side of the corridor Gwi slipped the fastener on a battered storage chest.It was half filled with maintenance materials that looked as if they had not been touched in years.Reaching within he rummaged around until he found a pair of small illuminating headbands.One he handed to Whispr, the other to Ingrid.It will not be sensible or convenient to take your own equipment with you.People might ask what a doctor and her assistant are doing inside the facility carrying dirty gear designed for walking in the desert.This is a good place to leave it.After removing his water bottle and some food bars and shoving them into the interior pockets of the white overgown he had selected, a reluctant Whispr deposited his pack and the rest of his supplies in the chest.Ingrid placed her own battered pack beside his and watched as Gwi closed and secured the lid.Reaching up to pull off her filthy, grime encrusted desert shirt, she found her companion staring at her.The more tactful of the two men, Gwi had turned away.Look, Whispr, I dont have any particular nudity phobias, and weve certainly spent enough time in each others company, but Id appreciate it if you didnt stare, okay?Besides, you should be focusing on getting dressed yourself.All right, sure.No big deal.Moving over to the storage box he began stripping off his own dusty garb.Gleaming like square pearls, the neatly folded pure white medical attire Gwi had brought was slipped on in place of his old clothing.As he dressed he stared resolutely down the corridor and away from her.Keeping his word as he finished dressing proved harder than crossing the Sperrgebeit.When he finally finished and turned, the sight that greeted his eyes in the dim light stunned him.Standing in the corridor was not the hardened woman in whose company he had recently traversed Sanbona and the Namib.His thoughts sprang backward, all the way back to distant, dearly missed Savannah and a pristine modern doctors office in an expensive contemporary medical codo tower.For the first time in a long while he again found himself in the company of Dr.Ingrid Seastrom, general practice physician and respected member of the Southeast Namerica Medical Association.Youre staring, she said.You promised you wouldnt stare.That was while you were naked and getting dressed.Youre still looking at me like Im naked.He started to say something, realized instinctively that he was likely to only dig himself a deeper hole, and simply nodded as he turned away.Once more clad in the clean white garb of her profession Ingrid felt unaccountably confident.It was all she could do, however, to keep from laughing at Whispr.Designed to fit a Natural, his white coat hung like a shroud from his thin shoulders.Only a pair of clasps taken from his pack kept his pants from puddling around his ankles.He did not look happy.But then, she mused, that was a constant, a routine reflection of his personality.Snappier clothing would have done nothing to brighten his mien.Gwi was also looking in her direction, but without the expected glint in his eyes.Impulsively, she grabbed their guide and kissed him.The young San looked startled.Whispr did not react at all.He had long since resigned himself to being Pluto to the sun called Seastrom.Youve done so much for us, Gwi.You and your people.Iwedont know how to thank you.You helped Auntie !Nisa.You are going now to try and help some young people like me.If you are lucky, sometimes in life you find a thing worth doing.He turned to go.Now I must leave and report in to my station.My friends will be glad to see me safely back.Gwi, wait.She put out a hand.Youre forgetting the last thing.You have to show us where the research center is.She gestured helplessly at their dark, dank, tunneled surroundings.Were underground and we dont even know how big Nerens is.I dont want to have to talk to anyone, to ask questions or directions, unless we have no other choice.He looked from her to Whispr and back again.I dont know where they do research here, miss doctor.I only know the sewerage system and a few other support areas, like the Laundry, that are involved with maintaining the lesser details of everyday life.I dont know any scientists or engineers or technologists.You will have to find this research center on your own.He was sympathetic but firm.Even if it means asking questions of others.Damn, Whispr muttered.I knew wed hit a dead end sooner or later.Dont say that, she told him.I told you Id find a way to pass myself off as someone who belonged here.I still believe I can do that.She shrugged.In any case, we have no choice.Well just have to try.There is one thing I can suggest that may get you started.Both of them turned back to their guide.As you would imagine of any modern place located in the Namib, Nerens has very efficient means for controlling its climate.Here it can be very hot in summer and very cold in winter, especially at night.Or belowground.The physicians overgown was all that kept Ingrid from shivering.Gwi nodded.There are many large pipings like those you see around us for moving warm or cold air.I have always thought it strange that so many run to the north.Whispr was puzzled.Why would you find that strange?In the near darkness Gwi eyed him evenly.I never know of anyone to go very far in that direction.Internal security is also very heavy in that direction.But if there is nothing there and not far to go, then why so much security?Sewerage pipes also go north, but once they reach a certain point none of us are asked to clean or check or repair them any farther.This seems strange to me, that only one part of Nerens should have its own sanitation system.Many service conduits go north, but to where?Ever cynical, Whispr had a ready explanation.Maybe they dont go anywhere.Maybe they just cycle back on themselves.Or empty out into a canyon invisible to environmental satellite scans.Or, an intrigued Ingrid proposed, maybe they feed into a sector thats off limits to the regular staff because its a separate facility thats important enough to justify its own discrete maintenance team.She stared up at him.For security reasons.He was shaking his head slowly.I dont like the idea of trying to crawl through a bunch of service ducts for who knows how far only to maybe come out in somebodys bedroom and have them raise the alarm.We dont have to exit the crawl until we see where we are, she countered.From the start youve been skeptical about my ability to pass myself off as a member of the local staff.Heres a chance to maybe avoid at least a few possible confrontations.She turned back to the silently watching Gwi.How long are the climate control pipes that go north?Dont know, the San told her honestly.You have no idea where they terminate or what lies at the far end?Once again he shook his head.She turned expectantly to Whispr, who sighed resignedly.By now he had come to know that look all too well.Weve come all this way to get to Nowhere.Whats a little more nowhere?he added glumly.I dont know what youre bitching about, she challenged him.With your frame, moving on hands and knees through a conduit or a duct will be a lot easier for you than for me.Cant argue that.He brightened slightly.You go first.She made a face.Like hell.Youre more sensitive to surprises and to when somethings not right.Ill follow you.She looked back at Gwi.Show us one of these climate control ducts that runs to the north.The biggest one you can.Committed now, Whispr added.Make it one that shunts air and not sewage.They hiked a good half a kilometer before their guide paused beside a suitable conduit.Since it was located deep within the Nerens complex, its service hatch was not security sealed.The diameter of the ductwork itself was more than large enough for them to enter it on all fours without banging their heads on the composite ceiling.Opening a small service box attached to a nearby wall, Gwi removed a pair of illuminands.Ceremoniously, he handed one to Ingrid and the other to Whispr.Goodbye, doctor.Goodbye, reed man.Gwi shook hands with each of them in turn.I wish you luck and that you may find that which you seek.I will look for you here, at this spot, at the same time every day until a week has passed.If I do not see you back here by then His voice trailed away.Thank you for helping Auntie !Nisa.He indicated the beckoning open hatch and suddenly broke out in a wide smile.If you had the San meld and could walk on all fours this would be so easy for you!Thanks anyway.Whispr spoke dryly as he checked to ensure that his full water bottle was still secure in a pocket.But Id rather bump my head a few times and be able to stand up straight at the end of the crawl.Very overrated, standing.Gwi was backing away.One day I think I must have the full four leg meld myself, when I decide it is time to return permanently to the land of my ancestors.And after you have paid me.But not yet.I wish you luck.He waved once, and then he was gone.Leaving a doctor and a survivor of Greater Savannahs mean streets alone to contemplate the darkness ahead of them, the monotonous pizzicato of dripping water, and an open hatch in the side of a conduit that disappeared into the wall opposite.Whispr took a step backward, smiled thinly, and gestured at the opening.Ladies first.She stared him down.We already settled this, Whispr.Ill follow you.Youre so skinny I can see around you, whereas Her voice trailed away as the implication of her own words hit her.Lets get moving.With a shrug he put both hands on the sides of the opening and prepared to pull himself in.What the hell; what difference does it make?Weve had to swim, weve had to hike, weve had to fly.Weve run on foot and traveled in boats and in cars.We even covered some ground inside a mechanical elephant.Not much we havent done but crawl.Once inside the conduit he placed the illuminand Gwi had given him over his head, tightened the band securely, positioned the front part against his forehead, and thumbed the integrated switch on the right side.The device promptly filled the black tunnel ahead of him with pale light.When Ingrid prepared to follow with her identical headband activated he tapped his own and instructed her to turn hers off.We dont know how long these things will last.They have indicators, but that doesnt tell us how fast their charges will deplete.He gestured at her forehead.Keep yours deactivated unless you absolutely need the light.Reaching up, he tapped his own again.If mine goes out, no matter where we are or how far weve gone we turn around and come back.We can always try again later.She nodded understandingly.See, Whisprthis is why I let you lead in situations like this.What, in sewers and air ducts?Im so flattered.Turning his head and aiming his illuminand forward, he began crawling.The floor of the conduit was smooth, cool to the touch, and reassuringly dry.For nearly an hour they made good progress.After that they had to stop and rest frequently.Despite the protection afforded by their freshly laundered and newly acquired medical attire, knees and palms were beginning to abrade.In the confined space protesting muscles had started to cramp.From time to time they paused to share measured sips from their water bottles.How many meters had they come?she wondered.Kilometers?How big was the facility at Nerens anyway?She thought back to what Gwi had told them.He admitted knowing nothing about what lay to the north beyond a certain point.What if this conduit had been angling deceptively to the west?It was impossible to tell for certain anymore which direction they were going.For all they knew the conduit ran all the way to the small servicing harbor at the coast.That lay more than a few kilometers to the west.Even if they managed to crawl such a distance by the time they emerged they would be lucky to have enough strength left to shout for help.Whispr, do you think were still heading north?He replied without looking back lest the light from his illuminand blind her.How should I know?I dont have a magnetic directional meld in my head and Im not a pigeon.I think were still going that way, yeah.If I had my communicator Even if you had your communicator and could use it, internal security might pick up the emissions.You know that.And thats why I cant tell you what direction were going.He paused.Hold up a minute.Her knees grateful for the halt, she sat down with her back against the side of the conduit.I wish I had tea instead of just water.I wish I had a magnum of Rogue River brut 48, he growled.As long as were wishing.He switched off his illuminand.Once again they were enveloped by a black as complete as the inside of a cave.See that?See what?She was almost too tired to care if he actually was seeing something.Straight ahead.In the darkness she could hear him moving to one side.Past and in front of me.It took her eyes some seconds to adjust.Initially she thought it was an illusion.Crawling forward, not caring now if she was in front of him, she moved toward it.As she advanced, confidence in what she was seeing increased along with the number of photons striking her retinas.Theres light ahead.And I can hear something.Machine noise, I think.And voices.Had the conduit been a little bigger they could have advanced side by side.As it was he followed her as for the first time she took the lead.Having finally been granted his earlier wish, he now had no interest in pursuing it.The intensifying glow ahead and the increasing variety of sounds had fully captured his attention.After all the arduous crawling they finally found their way blocked by a protective screen.Moving as close as possible to the metal mesh they started to peer through the gaps only to find they had to turn away because the light on the other side was so bright.It took their eyes a couple of minutes to adjust.When they were finally able to see where their efforts had led them Ingrid realized it was a good thing the screen had halted their advance.
