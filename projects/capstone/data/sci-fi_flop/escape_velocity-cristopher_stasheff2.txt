Thats what George thought.Hed seen such things as insecticides and dehumidifiers shipped out there.This heating unit didnt seem to make sense.So he ran to his sergeant and reported it, just bursting with pride, figuring hed get a promotion out of catching such an expensive mistake.And the sergeant told him to shut up and do what he was told?You have worked in a bureaucracy, havent you?Yeah, Ours not to question why, ours but to do and fry.That sort of thing.But.George had a moral sense!And he remembered the scuttlebutt about why even generals have to treat supply sergeants nicely.Just offhand, Id say his sergeant was no exception.Kind of looked that way, didnt it?So George did the right thing.He reported the sergeant?He wasnt that stupid.After all, it was just a set of numbers.Who could prove when theyd gotten into the computer, or where from?No, nobody couldve proven anything against the sergeant, but he could have made Georges next few years miserable.Reporting him wouldnt do any good, so George did the next best thing.He changed the goods number to one for a giant air cooling system.Sams eyes widened.Oh, no!Ah, Dar said bitterly, I see youve been caught in the rules, too.But George was an innocenthe only knew the rules for computers, and assumed the rules for people would be just as logical.Sam shook her head.The poor kid.What happened to him?Nothing, for a while, Dar sighed, and there never were any complaints from Betelgeuse Gamma.But after a while, his sergeant started getting nasty?No, and that shouldve tipped him off.But as I said, he didnt know the people rules.He couldnt stand the suspense of waiting.So, after a while, he put a query through the system, to find out what happened to that shipment.Sam squeezed her eyes shut.Oh, no!Oh, yes.Not quite as good as waving a signal flag to attract attention to the situation, but almost.And everything was hunky dory on Betelgeuse Gamma; the CO there had even sent in a recommendation for a commendation for the lieutenant who had overseen the processing of the order, because that air cooling plant had already saved several hundred lives in his base hospital.And before the day was out, the sergeant called George into his office.A little angry?He was furious.Seems the lieutenant had raked him over the coals because the wrong order number had been filedand against the sergeants direct order.George tried to explain, but all that mattered to the sergeant was that he was in trouble.He told George that he was remanding him to the lieutenants attention for disciplinary action.So it was the lieutenant whod been out to get the general on Betelgeuse Gamma!Or somebody in his command.Who knows?Maybe that CO had a lieutenant whod said something nasty to Georges lieutenant, back at the Academy.One way or another, the lieutenant didnt have to press charges, or initiate anythingall he had to do was act on his sergeants recommendation.He demoted George to private and requested his transfer to Eta Cassiopeia.Could be worse, I suppose, Sam mused.Well, George heard there was a war going on there at the momentbut that wasnt the real problem.This lieutenant had charge of a computer section, remember.Of coursewhats wrong with me?His traveling orders came out with a different destination on em.Sam looked up.Not Wolmar!Not here!Oh, yes, Dar said, with a saccharine smile.Here.And, the first time he showed his orders to an officer, the officer assumed that, if he was en route to Wolmar, he must be a convicted criminal, and clapped him in irons.How neat, Sam murmured, gazing into the distance.Off to prison, without taking a chance of being exposed during a court martial Your lieutenant was a brainy man.Not reallyhe just knew the system.So there George was, on his way here and nothing he could do about it.Couldnt he file a complaint?Sam bit her lip.No, of course not.Whats wrong with me?Right.Dar nodded.He was in the brig.Besides, the complaint wouldve been filed into the computer, and the lieutenant knew computers.And who would let a convicted felon near a computer terminal?But wouldnt the ships commanding officer listen to him?Why?Every criminal says he didnt do it.And, of course, once its on your record that youve been sent to a prison planet, youre automatically a felon for the rest of your life.Sam nodded slowly.The perfect revenge.He made George hurt, he got him out of the way, and he made sure Georged never be able to get back at him.She looked up at Dar.Or do you people get to go home when your sentence is up?Dar shook his head.No such thing as a sentence ending here.They dont send you to Wolmar unless its for life.He stopped and pointed.This is where a life ends.Sam turned to look.They stood in the middle of a broad, flat plain.A few hundred yards away stood a plastrete blockhouse, with long, high fences running out from it like the sides of a funnel.The rest of the plain was scorched, barren earth, pocked with huge blackened craters, glossy and glinting.The spaceport.Sam nodded.Yes, Ive been here.Great first sight of the place, isnt it?They chose the most desolate spot on the whole planet for the new convicts first sight of his future home.Heres where Georges life ended.And a new one began?Dar shook his head.For two years he wondered if he was in hell, with Wolmen throwing nasty, pointed things at him during the day and guards beating him up if he hiccupped during the night.He nodded toward the blockhouse again.That was the worst thing about this place, the first time I looked at itguards, all over.Everywhere.They were all built like gorillas, too, and they all loved painother peoples pain.Yes, I was wondering about that.Where are they?Gone, to wherever the computers reassigned them.When Shacklar came, the guards went.What?Sam whirled, staring up at him.Thats impossible!Oh, I dunno.Dar looked around.See any guards?Well, no, butone uniform looks just like any other to me.We didnt wear uniforms when I came here.First thing they did was give me a set of gray coveralls and tell me to get into em.His mouth tightened at the memory.Then he shook his head and forced a smile.But that was eleven years ago.Now we wear the uniforms, and the guards are gone.Why?Dar shrugged.Shacklar thought uniformsd be good for morale.He was right, too.No, no!I mean, why no guards?Wrong question.Look at it Shacklars waywhy have any guards?Sam frowned, thinking it over.To keep the prisoners from escaping.Where to?Dar spread his hand toward the whole vast plain.The Wolman villages?We were already fighting themhad been, ever since this, uh, colony started.No, no!Off planet!Where the rest of society is!Your victims!The rest of the universe!So how do you escape from a planet?Sam opened her mouthand hesitated.If you can come up with an idea, Ill be delighted to listen.Dars eyes glinted.Sam shut her mouth with an angry snap.Get going!All you have to do is get going fast enough!Escape velocity!Great idea!How do I do it?Run real fast?Flap my arms?Spare me the sarcasm!You hijack a spaceship, of course!We have thought of it, Dar mused.Of course, theres only one spaceship per month.You came in on it, so you know: Where does it go?Well, its a starship, so it cant land.It just goes into orbit.Around the  uh   Moon.Dar nodded.And a shuttle brings you down to the moons surface, and you have to go into the terminal there through a boarding tube, because you dont have a spacesuit.And therere hidden video pickups in the shuttle, and hidden video pickups all through the terminal, so the starships crew can make sure there arent any escaping prisoners waiting to try to take over the shuttle.Hidden video pickups?What makes you think that?Shacklar.He told us about them, just before he sent the guards home.Oh.Sam chewed it over.What would they do if they did see some prisoners waiting to take over the shuttle?Bleed off the air and turn off the heaters.Its a vacuum up there, you know.And the whole terminals remote controlled, by the starship; there isnt even a station master you can clobber and steal keys from.Sam shuddered.Dont worry, Dar soothed.We couldnt get up there, anyway.Sam looked up.Why not?Dar spread his hands.How did you get down here?The base sent up a ferry to bring us down.Dar nodded.Didnt you wonder why it wasnt there waiting for you when you arrived?I did think it was rather inconsiderate, Sam said slowly, but spaceline travel isnt what it used to be.Decadent, Dar agreed.Did you notice when the ferry did come up?Now that you mention it  after the starship left.Dar nodded.Just before it blasted out of orbit, the starship sent down a pulse that unlocked the ferrys enginesfor twenty four hours.Thats long enough.If you really had any gumption, you could take over the ferry after it lands, go back up to the moon, and wait a few months for the next starship.Great!We could bring sandwiches, and have a picnica lot of sandwiches; they dont store any rations up there, so wed need a few months worth.Theyd get a little stale, you know?Besides, the ferrys engines automatically relock after one round trip.But the real problem is air.I could breathe in that terminal.You wouldnt have if youd stayed around for a day.The starship brings in a twenty four hour air supply when it comes.They send an advance crew to come in, turn it on, and wait for pressure before they call down the shuttle.Dar gazed up at the sky.No, I dont think Id like waiting for a ship up there, for a month.Breathing CO gets to you, after a while.Its a gas, Sam said in a dry icy tone.I take it Shacklar set up this darling little system when he came?No, it was always here.I wouldnt be surprised if it were standard for prison planets.So, by the time Shacklard managed to reach the surface of Wolmar, he knew there wasnt really any need for guards.Except to keep you from killing each other!How many convicts were here for cold blooded murder?Not too many, really; most of the murderers were hot blooded.He shuddered at the memory.Very.But there were a handful of reptilesand three of them were power hungry, too.Why?Sam looked up, frowning.I mean, how much power could they get?Nothing that counts, if they couldnt leave the planet.If youll pardon my saying so, thats a very provincial view.I mean, theres a whole planet here.But no money.Well, not real money, no.But I didnt say they were out to get rich; I said they were out for power.Power over a mud puddle?A handful of soldiers?What good is that?Thanks for rubbing my nose in it, Dar snapped.Oh!Im sorry.Sams eyes widened hugely.I just turn off other peoples feelings, sometimes.I get carried away with what Im saying.Dont we all?Dar smiled bleakly, sawing his temper back.I suppose thats how the lust for power begins.Howby ignoring other peoples feelings?Dar nodded.Only worrying about how you feel.I suppose if youre the boss, you feel safer, and thats all that really matters.Not the bosses Ive met.Theyre always worrying about whos going to try to kick them out and take overand Im just talking about bureaucrats!She looked up at Dar.Would you believe itsome of them actually hire bodyguards?Sure, Id believe it!After living on a prison planet without guards.Oh.Your fellow prisoners were worse than the gorillas?Much worse, Dar confirmed.I mean, with the guards at least you knew who to watch out forthey wore uniforms.But with your friendly fellow prisoners, you never knew from one moment to the next who was going to try to slip a knife between your ribs.They let you have knives?Dar shrugged impatiently.The Wolmen could chip flints; so could we.Who was going to stop us, with the guards gone?No, they loaded onto the ferry and lifted off; Shacklar stepped into Government House and locked himself in behind concrete and steel with triple locks and arm thick bolts  and the monsters came out of the woodwork.Anybody who had a grudge hunted down his favorite enemy, and started slicing.Or got sliced up himself.Immoral!Sam muttered.How could he bring himself to do such a thing!Dar shrugged.Had to be hard, I guess.Lord knows we had enough hard cases walking around.When they saw blood flowing, they started banding together to guard each others backs.And the first thing you knew, there were little gangs roaming around, looking for people to rough up and valuables to steal.Sam snorted.What kind of valuables could you have had?Food would do, at that point.Distribution had broken down.Why should the work gangs work, without the guards to make them?Finally, we mobbed the warehouse and broke inand ruined more food than we ate.He shuddered at the memory.They started knife fights over ham hocks!That was about when I started looking for a hole to crawl into.Your general has no more ethics than a shark!Sam blazed.How could he just sit there and let it happen?I expect he had a pretty good idea about how it would all come out.How could he?With chaos like that, it was completely unpredictable!Well, not really  Whatre you talking about?You couldve all killed each other off!Thats predictable, isnt it?But there wasnt too much chance of it, I guess.There were too many of ushalf a million.Thats a full society; and anarchys an unstable condition.When the little gangs began to realize they couldnt be sure of beating the next little gang they were trying to steal from, they made a truce instead, and merged into a bigger gang that could be sure of winning a fight, because it was the biggest gang around.So other little gangs had to band together into bigger gangs too.Sam nodded.And that meant the bigger gangs had to merge into small armies.Right.Only most of us didnt realize all that; we just knew there were three big gangs fighting it out, all of a sudden.The power hungry boys you told me about?Dar nodded.And they were pretty evenly balanced, too.So their battles didnt really decide anything; they just killed off sixty men.Which meant you had to stay way clear of any of em, or theyd draft you as a replacement.So two of them made a truce and ganged up on the third?No, the Wolmen ganged up on all of us, first.Oh.Sam looked surprised, then nodded slowly.Makes sense, of course.I mean, why should they just sit back and wait for you to get yourselves organized?Right.It made a lot more sense to hit us while we were still disorganized.And wed stopped keeping sentries on the wall, and the Wolmen knew enough to hit us at night.Sam shuddered.Why werent you all killed in your beds?Because the Big Three did have sentries, to make sure none of the others tried a night attack.So all of a sudden, the sirens were howling, and everybody was running around yellingand military conditioning took over.Military conditioning?Sam frowned.I thought you were convicts!Yeah, but we were still soldiers.Whatd you thinkthe Army provided a few battalions to fight off the Wolmen for us?We had to do our own fighting, with our own sergeants and lieutenants.The guards just stood back and made sure we didnt try to get any big ideas  and handled the laser cannons.But how could they let you have weapons?Dar shrugged.Bows and arrows, tops.That gave us a fair chance against the Wolmen.So when the sirens shrieked, we just automatically ran for the armory and grabbed our bows, and jumped any Wolman who got in our way.Then, when we had our weapons, we just naturally yelled, What do we do, Sarge?I mean, he was there getting his weapons, tooif he was still alive.And most of them were?What can I tell you?Rank has its privileges.Yeah, most of them were there, and they told us where to go.Sergeants usually do, I understand.Well, yes.But in this case, they just took us out to chop up anything that didnt wear a uniformand look for a lieutenant to ask orders from.We pulled together into companiesand the lieutenants were already squawking into their wrist coms, demanding that Shacklar tell them what to do.Why would they do ?Sam broke off, her eyes widening.I just realized something: soldiers are basically bureaucrats.Nobody wants to take a chance on getting blamed.It is kind of drilled into you, Dar admitted.And as I said, when the Wolmen came over the wall, habit took over.It did for Shacklar, too, I guess.He started telling them what to do.Habit, my great toe!Hed been waiting for a chance like thatcounting on it!Looking for me to disagree with you?Anyway, he had the viewscreens, and he knew the tactics; so he started giving orders.Dar shook his head in disbelief.If you can call them orders!Lieutenant Walker, theres a band of Wolmen breaking through over on the left; I really think you should run over and arrange a little surprise for them.Lieutenant Able, Sergeant Dorters squad is outnumbered two to one over on your companys right; would you send your reserves over to join him, please?Come off it!No general talks to his subordinates that way!Dar held up a palm.So help me, he did it!I overheard Lieutenant Walkers communicator.You mean you were in that battle?I had a choice?But I thought you tried to find a hole to crawl into!Sure.I didnt say I succeeded, did I?Sam turned away, glowering.I still dont believe it.Why should he be so polite?We figured it out later.In effect, he was telling us it was our war, and it was up to us to fight it; but he was willing to give us advice, if we wanted it.Good advice, I take it?Oh, very good!We had the Wolmen pushed back against the wall in an hour.Then Shacklar told the lieutenants to pull back and give them a chance to get away.They all answered, basically, The hell with that noise!Weve got a chance to wipe out the bastards!Indeed you do, Shacklar answered, and they all have brothers and cousins back homesix of them for every one of you.But if you do try to exterminate themwell, youll manage it, but theyll kill two of your men for every one of theirs.Well, the lieutenants allowed that he had a point, so they did what he said and pulled back; and the Wolmen, with great daring and ingenuity, managed to get back up over the wall and away.Then he told you to break out the laser cannon?No, hed sent the cannons home with the guards.Good thing, too; Id hate to think what those three power mongers wouldve done with them.But we did have hand blasters, in the armories.Each of the power mongers had managed to seize an armory as a power base as soon as hed recruited a gang.Theyd opened the doors and issued sidearms as soon as the sirens screamed.They werent much good for the close fighting inside the wall; but, once the Wolmen were over the top and running, we got up on the parapet and started shooting after them, until the lieutenants yelled at us to stop wasting our charges.The Wolmen were running, and they didnt stop until morning.A victory, Sam said dryly.A bigger one than you thinkbecause as soon as the shooting was over the three would be warlords showed up with their henchmen, bawling, All right, its all over!Turn in your guns!Go home!They what!Well, sure.Dar shrugged.After all, theyd opened up the armories for us, hadnt they?Shouldnt we give them their guns back now?I mean, youve got to see it from their viewpoint.I hope you didnt!Of course we didnt.We just turned around grinning, and pointed the guns at them.But we didnt say anything; we let the lieutenants do the talking.What talking?It depended.The nice ones said, Hands up.The rest of them just said, Fire!And we did.Sam formed a silent O with her lips.It was quick and merciful, Dar pointed out.More than they had a right to, really.What did you do without them?I mean, they had provided some sort of social order.I see you favor loose definitions.But while the ashes cooled, the lieutenants got together and did some talking.They elected a leader?Yeah, they could all agree that they needed to.But they werent so unanimous about who.There were four main candidates, and they wrangled and haggled, but nobody could agree on anythingI mean, not even enough to call for a vote.How long did they keep that up?Long enough for it to get pretty tense, and the boys on the battlements were getting kind of edgy, eyeing each other and wondering if we were going to be ordered to start burning each other pretty soon.You wouldnt really have done it!I dunno.That military conditioning runs pretty deep.You dont know what youll do when you hear your lieutenant call, Fire!Sam shuddered.What are youanimals?I understand the philosophers are still debating that one.My favorite is, Man is the animal who laughs.Fortunately, Lieutenant Mandring thought the same way.Whos Lieutenant Mandring?The one with the sense of humor.He nominated General Shacklar.Sam whirled, the picture of fury.Then she developed a sudden faraway look.You know   Dar pointed a finger at her.Thats just about the way all the other lieutenants reacted.They started to yellthen they realized he meant it for a joke.After theyd finished rolling around on the ground and had it throttled down to a chuckle, they started eyeing each other, and it got awfully quiet.But Shacklar didnt even try to talk them into it!He didnt have to; hed given them a taste of do it yourself government.So they were ready to consider a change of dietbut nobody wanted to be the first one to say it.So Lieutenant Griffin had to take ithes the one with the talent for saving other peoples faces.Too bad he cant do anything about his own  What happened!Oh!Yes  well, all he said was, Why dont we ask him what he thinks?And after they got done laughing again, Lieutenant Able said, Itd be good for a laugh.And Lieutenant Walker said, Sure.I mean, we dont have to do what he says, you know.Well, they could all agree on that, of course, so they put Lieutenant Walker up to it, he having spoken last, and he called the General on his wrist com, explained the situation, and asked what hed do in their place.He said he was willing to serve, but really thought they ought to elect one of their own number.Sam smiled.How nice of him!Whatd they do back at Square One?They asked the comedian for a suggestion.He said they ought to call out each lieutenants name and have everybody who had confidence in him raise a hand.Who won?Everybody; they all pulled, No confidence.So Lieutenant Mandring called for a vote on General Shacklar.How long was the pause?Long enough for everybody to realize they were getting hungry.But after a while they started raising hands, and three hundred sixty out of four hundred went up.This, for the man who had to hide in a fortress?What changed their minds?The chaos, mostlyespecially since hed just done a good job directing them in battle.Soldiers value that kind of thing.So they called Shacklar and told him he was elected.I take it he was glad to hear it.Hard to say; he just heaved a sigh and asked them to form a parliament before they went to lunch and to start thinking about a constitution while they ate.Constitution!In a prison?Why not?I mean, theyd just elected him, hadnt they?Sam developed a faraway look again.I suppose  So did they.That was the turning point, you seewhen we started thinking of ourselves as a colony, not a prison.When we wrote the constitution, we didnt call Shacklar wardenwe named him governor.Generous of you, Sam smirked, considering Terra had done it already.Yeah, but we hadnt.And once he had the consent of the populace, he could govern without guards.That  makes  a weird kind of sense.Doesnt it?Only when you can make a whole planet into a prison, of courseand theres no way out.But thats the way it is here.So he could send the guards home, and let us fight it out for ourselves.Which made you realize he was better than the natural product.It did have that advantage.And, once his position was consolidated, he could start proposing reforms to the Council.Council?The legislative body.The Wolmen are agitating for representation, now.But thats okaywe traders are angling for a rep at their moots.Anyway, Shacklar talked the Council into instituting pay.Oh, that certainly must have taken a lot of convincing!It did, as it happens; a fair number of them were Communists.But pay it wasin scrip; worthless off planet, Im sure, but it buys a lot herea BTU for a neat bunk, two BTUs for a clean yard, and so forth.Great!Where could they spend it?Oh, the General talked Cholly into coming in and setting up shop, and a few of the con  uh, colonists, decided he had a good thing going, and   Pretty soon, the place was lousy with capitalists.Just the bare necessitiesa general store, a fix it shop, and three taverns.That general store looks more like a shopping complex.Just a matter of scale.Anyway, that created a driving hunger for BTUs and that meant soldiers started spiffing up, and   Higher morale, all over, Sam muttered.Because they can improve their lot.Right.Then Cholly started paying top dollar for pipe leaf traders, and   A drug baron!Suppose you could call him that.But it turned out there was a market for itthe drugs very low bulk after its processed, you see; and it doesnt provide euphoria or kill pain, but it does retard the aging process.So Universal Pharmaceuticals was interested, and Interstellar Geriatrics, and   I get the picture.Top money.But it costs a lot, tooespecially at first, when it was a little on the hazardous side.But Cholly was bringing in trade goods that made glass beads just sharp cornered gravel, so once we managed to get trade started, it mushroomed.And all of a sudden, the Wolmen werent quite so hostile any more.Sam nodded.Aw, you peeked.Dar scuffed at the turf with his boot toe.And from there, of course, it was just a little fast talking to get them to agree to the chalk fights.So trade is growing, and morale is growing, and youre taking the first steps toward a unified society, and everybody feels as though theyve got some opportunity, and  Sam broke off, shaking her head, dazzled.I cant believe it!The central planets are mired in malaise and self pity, and out here in the marches, youve managed to build a growing, maybe even hopeful, society!Back on Terra, everybodys living in walking despair because nobody feels they can make things better.What?Dar was shocked.But theyve got everything!Theyve   Got nothing, Sam sneered.On Terra, youll die doing the job your father did, and everybody knows it.Youve got your rooms, your servos, and your rations.And thats it.But even beggars have whole houseswith furniture that makes anything here look like firewood!And they dont have to do a lick of housework, with all those servostheir free times all free!Free to do whatrot?To do anything they want!I mean, even a rube like me has heard whats included in those rations.Sam shrugged.Sure, you can get drunk or stoned every night, and you can go out to a party or go to a show   Dar gave a whimpering sigh.but actually do something?No chance!Unless youre born into governmentand even they cant figure out anything worth doing.But  Dar flailed at the sky.But theres a thousand worlds out there to conquer!Why bother?She smiled bitterly.Weve done that alreadyand it hasnt improved things back on Terra much.Hasnt improved!?But your poorest beggar lives like a medieval king!Oh, does she?Sams eyes glittered.Wherere the servants, the musicians, the courtiers, the knights willing to fight for her smile?Even a Terran reject has three or four servos!Theyll even turn on the audio for himand theres your musicians!And the courtiers?The knights?Sam shook her head.What made a king royal was being able to command other peopleand theres no coin thatll buy that!Dar could only stare.Then he gave his head a quick shake, pushing out a whistle.Boy!Thats sick!Also decadent.She smiled, with Pyrrhic triumph.Theyre moribund there.What I cant figure out is how you folks avoid it.Dar shrugged.Because were already at the bottom?I mean, once youve landed here, theres no place to go but up!Theres no place to go, period!Sams eyes lit.Maybe thats itbecause its out here in the marches!Out here, on the edge of civilizationbecause anything youre going to do, youre going to have to do for yourselves.Terras too far away to send help.And too far away to really be able to run you, either.By the time they can tell you not to do something, youve already been doing it for a year!And because  She clamped her mouth shut.Because they really dont care?Dar grinned.Because this place is a hole, and the only people Terra sends out here are the ones they want to forget about?I wouldnt be surprised if they even wanted to get rid of Shacklar.Of course; he was a threat to the ones with the real power.I mean, after all, hes capable.He was bound to make waves.Which Im about to do too.Im braced.Dar tried to hide the smile.You still havent shown me how youre not really fleecing the natives.No, I havent, have I.  But it does take showing.We start trading at sundown.2  Thats not the way to make a campfire, Sam pointed out.What would you know about it?Dar blithely heaped green sticks and leaves onto the flaming kindling.Youre a city girl.Who says?You.You said you came from Terra, and its just one great big city.It is, but weve kept a few parks, like the Rockies.I do know youre supposed to use dry wood.Entirely correct.Dar smiled up at the roiling column of thick gray smoke turning gold in the sunset.Sam sighed.All right, so youre trying to attract attention.What do we use for cooking?Why bother?Dar started foraging in the foodbag.All weve got is cheese and crackers.And raisin wine, of course.Sam shuddered.Darkness came down, and company came upfive Wolmen, each with a bale on his shoulder  Ah!Company for cordials!Dar rubbed his hands, then reached for the bottle and the glasses.Get em drunk before they start bargaining, huh?Sam snorted.Thatd take more liquor than I can pack.But they count it friendly.He stepped toward the arrivals, raising the bottle.How!You not know, me not tell you, the first grunted, completing the formula.Good seeing, Dar Mandra.Good to see you, too, Hirschmeir.Dar held out a handful of glasses; the Wolman took one, and so did each of his mates as they came up.Dar poured a round and lifted his glass.To trade!And profit, Hirschmeir grunted.He drank half his glass.Ah!Good swill after long hike.And hot day gathering pipeweed.Yeah, I know, Dar sympathized.And it brings so little, too.Five point three eight kwahers per ounce on Libra exchange, a second Wolman said promptly.Dar looked up in surprise.Thats the fresh quote, right off todays cargo ship.Whered you get it?You sell us nice wireless last month, Hirschmeir reminded.Tell Sergeant Walstock him run nice music service.Sure will.Dar pulled out a pad and scribbled a note.Little heavy on drums, though, another Wolman said thoughtfully.Gotcha, Slotmeyer.Dar scribbled again.More booze, anybody?Five glasses jumped out.Dar whistled, walking around with the bottle, then picked up a bale.Well.Lets see what were talking about.He plopped the bale onto the front of the grav sled.Twenty seven point three two kilograms, the sled reported.Ninety seven percent Organum Translucem, with three percent grasses, leaf particles, and sundry detritus.The sundrys the good part.Dar hefted the bale back off the sled and set it about halfway between himself and Hirschmeir.You sure that thing not living?one of the Wolmen demanded.Sure.But its got a ghost in it.No ghost in machine.The Wolman shook his head emphatically.Dar looked up sharply, then frowned.Did I sell you folks that cubook series on the history of philosophy?Last year, Hirschmeir grunted.Lousy bargain.Half of tribe quote um Locke now.Locke?Dar scowled.I wouldve thought Berkeley and Sartre would be more your speed.Old concepts, Slotmeyer snorted.We learn at mothers knees.You forgetour ancestors opposition culture.That does keep slipping my mind, Dar confessed.Well!How about two hundred thirty four for the bale?Hirschmeir shook his head.Too far below Libra quote.Your scrip only worth eighty percent of Libran BTU today.Im going to have to have a talk with Sergeant Walstock, Dar growled.Okay, so my price is twenty percent low.But you forgetwe have to pay shipping charges to get this stuff to Libra.And your boss Cholly also gotta pay you, and overhead, Slotmeyer added.We not forget anything, Dar Mandra.Except that Chollys gotta show some profit, or he cant stay in business, Dar amended.Okay, lookhow about two seventy five?Tenth of a kwaher?Hirschmeir scoffed.He bent over and picked up his bale.Nice talking to you, Dar Mandra.Okay, okay!Two eighty!Two ninety, Slotmeyer said promptly.Okay, two eighty five.Dar sighed, shaking his head.The things I do for you guys!Well, its not your worry if I dont come back next month.Hope you like the new man.No worry.We tell Cholly we only deal with soft touch.Hirschmeir grinned.Okay.What you got to sell, Dar Mandra?Oh, a little bit of this and a minor chunk of that.Dar turned to the sled.Wanna give me a hand?Together, all six of them manhandled a huge crate onto the ground.Dar popped the catches and opened the front and the left side.The Wolmen crowded around, fingering the merchandise and muttering in excitement.What this red stone?Slotmeyer demanded, holding up a machined gem.Ruby for laser?Dar nodded.Synthetically grown, but it works better than the natural ones.Here barrels, another Wolman pointed out.Same model you sold us instruction manual for?Hirschmeir weighed a power cell in his palm.Dar nodded.Double X 14.Same as the Navy uses.What this?One of the Wolmen held up a bit of machined steel.Part of the template assembly for an automatic lathe, Dar answered.Slotmeyer frowned.What is lathe?Dar grinned.Instruction manuals only twenty five kwahers.Twenty five?Hirschmeir bleated.Dars grin widened.Hirschmeir glowered at him, then grimaced and nodded.You highway robber, Dar Mandra.No, low way, Dar corrected.Cholly tells me Im not ready for the highway.Him got high idea of low, Hirschmeir grunted.What prices on laser parts?Dar slid a printed slip out of his jacket pocket and handed it to Hirschmeir.Scuse me while you study that; Ill finish the weigh in.He turned away to start hoisting bales onto the sleds scale as the Wolmen clustered around Hirschmeir, running through the price list and muttering darkly.Sam stepped up and tapped Dar on the shoulder.What happened to all the ums on the ends of their verbs?Hm?Dar looked up.Oh, they know me, y see.No need to put on a show anymore.All right, all right!Hirschmeir grumbled.We take three rubies, three barrels, ten power supplies, and template assembly for lathe.Gotcha.Dar pressed a button on the scale, and it murmured, Total for goods, 4235.50 BTUs.Dar nodded.And the total for your pipeweed is 5337.50.You can spend another 1102, Hirschmeir.No got any more goods we want, Slotmeyer grunted.Hirschmeir nodded, holding out a palm.Cash be nice.You could put it on deposit at the bank, Dar offered.Chollys starting up a new kind of account.Hirschmeir shook his head.Only pays lousy five percent per annum.We do better use it for stake for playing poker with soldiers.But this is a new kind of account, Dar reminded.The interest is compounded quarterly.Hirschmeirs head lifted a little, and his frown deepened.Interest compounded?What that mean?That means that, at the end of every five months, the interest is paid into your account, and figured as part of the principal for the next quarter.So for second quarter, Cholly pay interest on 1157.125?Dar nodded.And for the third quarter, hell be paying you interest on 1162.48.Youre getting an effective annual yield of twenty one and a half percent.Cholly go broke, Slotmeyer snapped.No, hell make a profitif enough of you open up these accounts.If he gets five thousand for capital, he can buy Bank of I. D. E.  bonds that pay twenty three percent effective.Slotmeyers head lifted slowly, his eyes widening.He whirled to Hirschmeir.Take it!You sure?Hirschmeir looked decidedly uncomfortable.Sure?When Cholly making profit, too?Gotta be straight deal!Hirschmeir looked at the ground for a few minutes; then he looked up at Dar, face firming with decision.Right.We open new account.Right here.Dar whipped out the papers and handed them to Hirschmeir; but Slotmeyer intercepted them.He scanned the pages quickly, muttering to himself, then nodded and passed them on to Hirschmeir.Hirschmeir made his sign and added his signature after it in parentheses.Dar took the papers back, fed them into a slot in the sled.It chuckled to itself, then fed out a copy of the forms, and spat out a small flat blue booklet.Dar checked the passbook to make sure the deposit was recorded properly, then nodded and passed the bundle to Hirschmeir.The Wolman folded them away, straightening and grinning.Okay, Dar Mandra.Is good doing business with you.Always a pleasure.Dar held up the bottle.One for the trail?Sam watched the Wolman troop move off into the night, while Dar reloaded the grav sled and fastened the tarp down again.Finally she turned back to him.Why do they call it pipeweed?Hm?Dar looked up.Take a look at it.Sam stepped over and fingered one of the bales.Long, thin, hollow stems.She nodded.Little pipes.Dar covered the bale and fastened down the last corner of the tarp.Good quality, too.Not a bad nights trading.But how can you say that?Sam erupted.Youve scarcely made any profit at all!About one and a half percent.Dar picked up a plastic cube and stood up.Which is pretty good.Chollys happy if I just break even.Oh, he is, huh?Sam jammed her fists on her hips.What is he, a philanthropist?A teacher, Dar reminded, and Shacklars a politician.All Cholly really cares about is how much the Wolmen learn from the trading; and all Shacklar cares about is tying the Wolmen into an economic unit with the soldiers.And the good will that goes with both, of course.Of course, Sam echoed dryly.And I suppose you manage to pick up a few items about Wolman culture on every trip.Which I faithfully report back to Cholly, who makes sure it winds up as beer gossip.Dar grinned.Give us ten years, and the soldiers and Wolmenll know each others culture almost as well as their own.Well, they do seem to have a pretty thorough grasp of basic finance.And Slotmeyers getting some ideas about law, Dar said with a critical nod.Hes coming along nicely.Sam frowned.You sound like a teacher gloating over a prize pupil Oh!Dar gave her a wicked grin.Of course; I should have realized, she said dryly.Cholly doesnt hire traders; he recruits teachers.Pretty much, Dar confirmed.But we do have to have an eye for profit and loss.How about the loss to the Army?Hm?Dar looked up.What loss?Those laser partstheyre military issue, arent they?Dar stared at her while his smile congealed.Come on, Sam wheedled, you can trust me.I mean, after all, I know enough to sink you already, if I really wanted to.Dars smile cracked into a grin.How?Were already sunk here.Sam frowned, nonplussed.But how do you know Im not a BOA spy?Or an Army spy, trying to find out what Shacklars really doing here?For all you know, when I get back to Terra, I might issue a report that would get him pulled off this planet.Dar nodded.Yeah.You could be.Sam inched away from him, watching him as a mouse watches a waking cat.But you obviously arent, Dar finished.Sam frowned indignantly.How the hell could you tell?Well, in the first place, I dont believe anybody on Terra really cares about what happens out herenot in the Army, and not in BOA either.Shacklar is building a power base, Sam pointed out.
