But Ill hurt him.The look she gave him spoke volumes.He clenched his own teeth and ground thumb and fingers into Rhyss face until his mouth opened enough to pitch four of the tiny pills inside; then held his jaw closed and tipped his head back, massaging his throat until he swallowed convulsively.How long?Aryel asked quietly.She was still standing by the bed, a hand resting on the blanket.Before they take effect?She raised an inquiring eyebrow at Zavcka.A minute or two.She resisted the urge to spit curses or rub her bruised shoulder and instead pressed both hands flat against the wall behind her, trying to still the trembling.Her brain felt sluggish, caught in a loop of shock and rage that was making it hard to think; and she needed to think, needed to try to work a way out of this.Refusing to volunteer the pills had been a mistake.There was nothing to be gained by antagonizing them as long as they held the balance of power.She needed to reverse that.What did she know, and how could she use it?Khan was with them.Had he always been?Was it just him, plus the two upstairs?If so that made itshe calculated rapidlyseven people she had to try and contain.What levers did she have, what kinds of pressure could she bring to bear?And if it went beyond them who else would they have brought into the loop, what could she...Across the room, Aryel Morningstar had stooped to retrieve the plastic tube from Callan and was walking toward her with it, shaking it over her palm.You could use this yourself, I see, she said quietly, and held out a tiny white pill at arms length.Zavcka stared in astonishment, as behind her Callan growled a protest.Aryels eyes never moved from Zavckas face as she replied.No point letting her go downhill as well, Cal.Sharons going to need her to answer a lot of questions.She waited until Zavcka had reached out hesitantly, taken the tablet and gulped it down before saying pleasantly, You can also save yourself the trouble of coming up with an offeror a threatto try to prevent that.Detective Inspector Varsi and half a dozen officers are currently in the lobby, all trying to pile into the elevators along with a paramedic team.Another ambulance and goodness knows how many more police are on their wayOh, theyre here now?Just arriving.Thank you, Eli.Sharon, note that Ms.Klist has just taken a dose of her medication.Zavcka felt her jaw drop.Aryel was listening, she was speaking, into her earset.She nodded, apparently at something only she could hear, and pinned Zavcka with those eyes again.Are you confused, Ms.Klist?Let me explain.Rhyss tablet wasnt copying your server, it was linking it to the streams via your own old relay system.He linked Callans as well.Herran used that link to activate Cals earset, including the microphones ambient pickup function, and conferenced in Eli, me, Gwen, and Sharon and Mikal Varsi.Weve all heard every word thats been said since you stepped into this room.By the time he got down into the bowels of the BelNatur building, Eli Walker was beginning to think he too might be in need of something to settle the tremble in his hands and help him catch up with his sense of ever expanding astonishment.He had barely been able to credit the sheer audacity of Aryel Morningstar, plummeting down onto the roof of the tower through bomb bright cracks of lightning and sheeting rain as the storm burst around her; calling Arthur Khan as she did so to tell him that an express elevator was being sent up for her, that it would stop and the doors would open on the executive floor for five seconds on the way, and it was his job to get all of the passengers out of it.Then Khan not only doing as he was told but riding up to meet her, saying, unprompted, Somethings happening.I dont know what but I think its bad.Shes just gone below stairs and she said it in front of me and Im not supposed to know theres anything down there.Aryel gave him two chances to get off, put as much distance between himself and the unfolding scandal as he could: first when the elevator stopped to pick up Eli and Herran on the way down, and again when it deposited them in the lobby.Gwen had raced in at that point, a blur of brown and red and wet, almost knocking Eli off his feet as she streaked past and slammed into the elevator next to Aryel.He had not thought it was physically possible for a human being to move so fast.Following her, his own considerable speed torpid by comparison, the looming, comforting presence of Mikal, borne in on a sound wave of approaching sirens.Sharons almost here.Maybe you should wait?But Aryel had said, Herran, now!and the doors had barely closed on the three of them before the shot rang out in their earsets, along with Dunmores strangled shriek.By the time Sharon screamed up with two patrols and the paramedics, even though he knew the worst of it must be over, he was living on the edge of his nerves.Herran, are you okay to stay with Mik?I need, I need to get down to them.Okay with Mik.Nodding and rocking over his tablet, cross legged in a corner of the lobby, ignoring or oblivious as he had been all along to the babble and bustle of clusters of curious employees, their numbers growing and anxiety peaking as the police herded them back.Sharon sighed and said, I really shouldnt allow you to do that, and he gave her a look, and she said, Oh, what the hell.In for a penny, in for a pound, and waved him into the elevator.And all the way down, they listened.Eli wondered whether Zavcka didnt realize she was still being heard by otherseven more others, as Herran linked in more earsets.He knew Masoud was en route now and listening in, as were the officers in the elevator with them.Maybe she thought they had killed the connection, or maybe she just didnt care anymore.You might have made him worse, you know, she was saying savagely.That medicine isnt a generic, it was specially formulated for me.What makes you think itll work on him?It is working, look at him.Aryels voice, serene in response.Where do you think he got this condition from anyway?This is your illness, Zavcka.Mutated, early onset, and far, far worse, but fundamentally the same syndrome.He inherited it from you.Gasps from the police in the carriage as Eli and Sharon exchanged bewildered glances, echoing a muttered, What?in their ears from Callan.Gwen was silent, save for the murmured, unceasing baby talk.What do you mean inherited?He has nothing to do with me!I never had any children!Snarled, but with a note of doubt, Eli thought, as the doors slid open and they tumbled out.And if I did, they wouldnt be He could hear her voice in his other ear too now.He flicked the earset silent as he and Sharon led the charge down the corridor toward them.They wouldnt be gems?Zavcka, please.Rhys and Gwen are Phoenix products.And Phoenix is you.You are the oneAh, the cavalry.Aryel looked up as they appeared in the doorway.Watch your step.She stood by a hospital bed, on which lay the girl: unconscious, heavily pregnant, horribly burned, but the undamaged parts of her face and her stubble of hair so like Rhyss and Gwens that Eli felt the breath go out of him.A batch siblingshe must be.There was another survivor, then.Backed up against the right wall, Zavcka Klist as Eli had never seen her, could never have imagined seeing her: face venomous, composure irretrievably cracked, the angles of her tall frame more contorted than elegant.She looked shockingly old.Against the left, down on the floor, Rhys, and Callan, and Gwen.If Rhys was better now Eli shuddered to think how bad it must have been.The young mans skin was terribly pale, its normal warm brown tinted a sickly green.His eyes were closed and his jaw slack; Callan was wiping away a spot of drool.Limbs and torso twitched in a constant, jerky, dreadful rhythm, but at least his entire body was not convulsing out of control.Eli supposed that had to be the improvement.At his feet, Dunmores corpse.He saw the injuries, registered the force that must have killed him, and found himself unsurprised.He had seen Gwen in action twice now, and if anything her brother would be stronger.The police and paramedics poured in around him.A hand pointlessly pressed to Dunmores crushed throat, the medic rising with a shake of the head and stepping swiftly on to bend over the girl on the bed.His colleague had gone straight to where Rhys was propped up, cradled between Callan and Gwen.She held a monitor unit, and Eli could hear her asking questions, low and urgent.Sharon Varsi took one sweeping look and issued a stream of orders: two officers detailed to begin searching the rest of the floor, two more to remain in the room with her, the fifth sent back to stand guard and direct traffic at the elevators.Cams on at all times.Medics have priority.Stay out of their way unless you need to render assistance.Mr.Khan, Im going to need a statement from you back at the Yard, but for the moment please accompany Constable Farah here.Farah, keep an eye on him, he looks a little peaked.She turned to the blond woman standing with her back to the wall.Zavcka Klist, you are under arrest on suspicion of illegal human genetic modification, aiding and abetting the theft of human genetic material, kidnapping, forced surrogacy, false imprisonment, attempted murder, and aiding and abetting the murder of Kendrick Nance.I must warn you that you do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defense if you do not mention when questioned something that you later rely on in court.Anything you do say may be given in evidence.And if you dont want to be physically restrained I suggest you stay exactly where you are until I tell you otherwise.Aryel had retreated to the opposite wall, as much out of the way as she could get in the crowded room.Desperate though he had been to reach them, now that he was there Eli did not know what to do.He crossed to stand beside her, sidestepping the paramedic who had finished checking the unconscious girl and was now joining the other one crouched in front of Rhys.You all right?Fine, she whispered back.But Rhys, I dont know about Rhys.And Gwen and Callan...He looked down at the cluster of heads at hip height beside him, Callans orange flame and Rhys and Gwens ruby casting an incongruously cheerful sunset glow against the white wall.Herran started running a search as soon as he got access and he thinks hes found his genetype.Hes found a batch anyway, and he says it looks about right.She nodded acknowledgment and said softly, into her earset, Herran, are you hearing me?Can you package up what youve found with Rhyss own Phoenix research, and send it ahead to the hospital?She listened.Thanks.Yes, hes very, very ill.Theyll be bringing him up in a minute.One of the officers was shaking a cover out over Dunmores body, as the paramedics angled their gurney into the room.Aryel frowned.Sharon?she said.Rhyss tablet is still on Dunmore, I think.Good point.Ennis, record me, please.The officer stepped closer, shoulder cam angled to capture her movement as she rifled inside the dead mans jacket and came out with the tablet.She slipped it into a clear plastic evidence sleeve and kept hold of it.We have his position, yes?Lets shift him, then.The medics need to get these two out of here.She looked questioningly at the one who had checked both the girl and Rhys.Shes stable, he said.Vital signs are good.His arent so good, were going to take him first.The rest of the crew are on their way down for her; shell be fine.Just dont touch anything.They manhandled the gurney next to him, then watched in amazement as Gwen straightened up, one arm under her brothers knees and the other beneath his shoulders while Callan supported his head.She placed him gently on the gurney, stepped clear so they could secure him, and turned into Aryels embrace.Gwen hugged back, but she was staring over Aryels shoulder and the arch of her wing at the girl on the bed.Eli realized it must be the first time she had focused on anyone but Rhys.She extricated herself and moved closer to look.Ey a, she said softly, amazed.Do you remember her, Gwennie?I dont know...I think...Ellyn.I think her name might be Ellyn.She turned back to them, her eyes bright with tears.I have to go with Rhys, Ari.Of course you do.You and Callan both.Go on.Da will meet you there, and Ill come as soon as I can.Callans head came up a fraction at the mention of his name, but he did not look around.His hand was still cupped against Rhyss face as the little procession made their way out of the room, and his eyes were so fixed on it that Eli did not know how he could tell where he was going.Love, he thought.It doesnt matter where youre going.You just go.He looked down at Aryel and found she was looking across at Zavcka Klist.The second set of paramedics were here now, their own gurney next to the bed as they bustled around it disconnecting and reconnecting the monitors and tubes attached to the girl Gwen had called Ellyn.They had folded back the blanket and he could see that the scars extended all the way down her left side.Her hand had been almost entirely burned away, leaving no more than melted stubs where the fingers and thumb should be.Zavcka Klist came a half step away from the wall.She looked tense enough to snap.What are you doing?One of the medics glanced over his shoulder.Getting ready to move her.We cant take that with us.He jerked a thumb at the life support unit and went back to what he was doing.She stared at his bent back, her mouth working and hands hooked into claws.Sharon, standing by the door listening to a whispered report from one of her officers, raised an interested eyebrow.Wait.What will happen to her?Whos going to look after her now?Shes going to the hospital, Zavcka, Aryel said quietly.Theyll look after her.Theyll take very good care of her.No.No.Suddenly words were tumbling out of her, desperate, frantic.You have to let me take care of her.Whatever else happens, you have to do that.I have everythingeverything she needs.Ive got more money than you can imagine.You have to let me give her what shell need, everything shell need The state will take care of her, Eli said, bemused.Shell have everything.The state?Thats not enough.Its not nearly enough.For fucks sake, Klist, you want us to believe you care about this girl?After everything youve done to her?It felt good to snap, release a little of his own rage and outrage.But Aryel placed a hand on his arm to calm him, the soothing touch and gentle shake of the head telling him there was, once again, something here that he did not understand.She moved to stand at Ellyns head, looking down at her scarred, sleeping face.She doesnt mean the girl were looking at, Eli.She means the girl inside of her, the baby girl shes carrying.Her eyes drifted down to Ellyns distended abdomen.Thats you in there, isnt it, Zavcka?A whole new you, now that the old you is finally wearing out.You with your one imperfection removed, or so you hope.Tell me, have you also fixed the thing Jarek was trying to fix?They stared at her: Sharon, the officers, and medics in complete bafflement, Eli with the familiar sense of pending revelation, and Zavcka with the cornered, desperate expression of a hunted animal finally run to ground.You cant, she whispered, and the horror and despair in her voice were such that he could almost have felt sorry for her.I cant know, or I cant tell?Im sorry, Zavcka, but I do and I will.Its time this particular skeleton came out of its closet.Aryel, Sharon said politely, what the hell are you talking about?You should know exactly who it is youre arresting, Inspector.Let me introduce you to Zavcka Klist.Zavcka the First, Eli.Daughter of Jarek.Born in the year 2042 of the old calendar.Thats impossible, he sputtered.Thats seventeen After Syndrome, thats almost a hundred and twenty years ago!Indeed.Thats how old she is, though I agree she generally doesnt look a day over forty five or so.She cocked her head critically at Zavcka, who had shrunk back against the wall as though hoping to fall right through it.A bit more than that today, but then it has been a rough one.That chain of Klists you described to me this morning, Elithe daughter, the granddaughter, the distant cousin, the great great granddaughterthey have all been the same woman.Childless and ageless, disappearing and reappearing and manipulating her own stream records to maintain the illusion of a dynasty when it was just one person all along.That, said Sharon in the same polite tone, as she watched Zavcka pin herself to the wall, is insane.Yes.Can you prove it?Yes.And what does it have to do with the child this girl is carrying?The child is a clone.It turns out that Zavcka here is not going to live forever after all.About five years ago, I reckon, she discovered that she has a degenerative neurological disorder, not unlike the Syndrome.Youve seen it at its worst in Rhys.Its moving slowly, probably because of her longevity mutation, but it will kill or disable her eventually.She did not consider that to be an acceptable outcome, so she set out to alter it.Now it also turns outand the proof of this part is on that tablet in your hand, by the waythat her genome formed the base stock for a truly vast amount of gemtech research.Her father set up a black lab, codenamed Phoenix, to unpick its potential, commercialize the findings via Klist Applied Genomics, and along the way try to solve an unfortunate consequence of the mutation.But after he died Phoenix started experimenting on its own account.One of those experiments resulted in me; later work delivered Rhys and Gwen, and poor Ellyn here.Isolated sequences found their way into end products right across the industry.There may well be a bit of her in Mikal; there certainly is in BelNatur gems like Gaela and Callan and Herran.Zavcka decided to track down all of them, correctly figuring that somewhere along the line the flaws would have been identified and engineered out.She set up this lab, she retrieved the genestock and she set about creating a healthy clone of herself.That clone is the baby growing inside this girl.There was a long, long silence.There was so much wrong with it that Eli didnt know where to start.He did know that Aryel was neither stupid nor insane, and he noted that Zavcka was neither ridiculing nor denying.She looked sick, but not stunned.He glanced across at Sharon, and saw that she was eyeing Zavcka, and Aryel, and no doubt thinking the same thing.The paramedics and the other police officers were eyeing each other, as though wondering how they had wandered into this madhouse, and how to get out.But, he said.Only one but?A clone isnt the same person.This Zavcka will still die.Youre sayingwhat?She wanted a baby version of herself she could raise to be as much like her as possible?I wish she were that selfless.What has her other big move been, the thing shes risked her reputation and huge amounts of money on?The infotech program.The ability to encode human thoughts and memories into a digital format, into binary.We were told its meant to create a more seamless interface, to be able to manipulate electronics directly with the mind, but think about it.Think about the implications of that research.In ten or fifteen years, when that baby is a young girl, where do you think the technology will have gotten to?What could you do with it then?Sharon got there first.Eli watched the color drain out of her face as the full horror of it dawned on him too.Holy fuck, she whispered.Shedreplace her?With herself?I think so.So does Herran, as it happens.He thinks its possible, and he should know.The moment stretched out, frozen, until one of the paramedics loudly cleared his throat and said, We need to take her now, in a tone that brooked no dissent.They had the desperate look of people who would do just about anything to get out of that room, and away from the lunacy that seemed to fill it.The two officers shifted from one foot to another, and looked as though they wished they had an excuse to go with them.As they moved Ellyn from her bed onto the gurney and covered her up again, Zavcka Klist started to speak.Her head was still down but she was looking up through her lashes at Aryel Morningstar; a pose that, bizarrely, reminded Eli of Herran.You unnatural, unholy bitch.Her voice was low, and thick with hate.You think I dont know who you are?What youve done?You think I wont tell them?Im sure you will.No one, no one, needed to get hurt here.If youd all just stayed out of my way, let me have what I wanted, no one would have gotten hurt.You think Im the one who damaged that girl?Shes an imbecile, none of this matters to her, she doesnt have any idea whats going on.I didnt do that to her.You did.Ms.Klist, Sharon said sharply, Ive arrested you for kidnapping, forced surrogacy, attempted murder, and a whole lot more.Defamation of character might not seem like much in comparison, but Ill happily add it to the list.I wish she were lying, Aryel said quietly.For once, shes not.Her voice was heavy with sorrow, and she ran her own small hand up the blanketed ridge of Ellyns arm, brushed the melted skin along the jaw, then touched her fingers to her own lips and pressed them gently against the sleeping girls cheek.Eli glanced at Zavcka Klist, and for the first time he thought he saw the fight go out of her.The paramedics took up positions at either end of the gurney, moving with a suggestive briskness, and Aryel stepped back to let them wheel it away.She looked across the blanketed mound of pregnant belly at Sharon.In a way I am just as responsible for whats happened here as Zavcka Klist is, and Im done with keeping secrets.I have another story to tell you, Inspector Varsi, and there are a lot more dead people in it.Binary        Scorched Nothing is left.The scars lap up to her feet, shockwaves of soot and debris in spreading semicircles, as though discarded by a retreating tide.The eruption point is a jagged, blackened hole in what remains of the front faade of the building.The explosion must have blown out the main entrance, she guesses, judging from the broad tier of steps that lead up to the mouth of the cavity.Their surface is pitted and buckled, and the firefighters and police who swarm up and down them do so carefully, for the too white brightness of the emergency lights casts harsh shadows, concealing as many hazards as it reveals.The starkness of that glare has the contradictory effect of making it harder, instead of easier, to identify what it illuminates.In front of the steps she notes two similar, oddly sculptural masses of twisted metal slats, spears of glass dangling haphazardly from their grooved edges, and wonders briefly what they were, before her mind draws the tortured shapes into perspective.The doors.She remembers her own fierce imaginings as she waited out the obfuscations of Panborn and Owen, of simply blowing the doors off this place and taking control, and her shock is replaced by anger.Someone else had the will, the invention, the audacity to do what she only dreamed.And not in order to take possession, but to leave it.A small sound like a sob from the functionary who accompanied them.She looks around, wrinkling her nose at the heavy smell of burningburned plastic, burned wood, burned fleshand notes with disapproval the traces of tears on the young mans face.He touches her arm wordlessly, gestures toward shapes laid out on the grass, clear of the furthest traces of the blast.Light pours onto them from even more high lux lamps, their spindly frames telescoped tall, square heads lowered as though in prayer, beaming down an indictment.Beyond all is dark, dark.The nighttime forest reaches up almost to the very edge of the primly paved, neatly trimmed square that lies before the burnt out shell.Outside this blasted oasis the silhouettes of trees march away in every direction, dense and impenetrable, towering.It seems to her that they lean in, as though to reclaim it already.Between the drawn lines of trees and trauma the bodies lie side by side by side, some already in bags, most only hastily covered by a sheet.She counts twelve, fifteen, twenty.Some of the mounds look too small, incomplete, but then she recalls there were children here too.Jonah trudges back toward them, carefully skirting the edge of the blast radius.Beyond him men and women in uniform shift and murmur and stare, and then go back to the hurrying business of interview and investigation.She sees the orange flight suits and green camouflage of the retrieval teams, corralled behind police vehicles and barricades, and thinks that steps must be taken to ensure the tale of this disaster does not spread.Jonah stops in front of her, face a mask of bitter disbelief.Survivors?Not as such.They say one of the juveniles is still hanging on.I want it kept alive.Whatever it takes.What about the staff?Panborn?Jonah shakes his head.Are all the gems accounted for?Theyre not sure.The...the one we came to see...they think shes dead, but they havent found a body.The others...He gestures wordlessly at the shrouded piles behind him.Its hard to say.And none of them are certain how many were here to begin with.She pushes back another surge of irritation at the unprofessionalism, the cobbled together unaccountability of it all.If they didnt manage to retrieve her why do they think shes dead?They tracked her to the edge of some kind of cliff, a river gorge.No way down.They exchange glances, the thought flashing unspoken between them, and Jonah shrugs.No reason to think that...She never had before, and the physics of it...it just doesnt work.The retrieval team believes she must have thrown herself off rather than be captured.Not that they know exactly what they were hunting...theyd never seen He breaks off at the look on her face.She breathes deeply, controlling her temper.No point taking it out on Jonah.The explosion was secondary to the fire?Apparently there were two.The first one was small, contained within the underground facility.Theyre still not sure how she caused it, but the way she used the chaos to get out...its clear it wasnt an accident, she must have had a plan.She released the others and led them outside but she didnt stay with them, she headed off on her own.She nods, picturing the disoriented gems stumbling through the forest in every direction, delaying and misdirecting the trackers while their liberator pursued her own escape.She appreciates the ruthlessness of it.So the retrieval team went after them.Yes.They say Panborn ordered them to go, said rounding up the gemsespecially herwas top priority, not to worry about the fire, they had it under control.They picked up the others fairly quicklyseems they were mostly quite youngand returned them here, then went back out to support the unit on her trail.So the helicopter and foot squads were all miles away, the other side of the hills, when they heard the second explosion.By the time they got back Jonah breaks off again, surveying the destruction.So what caused it?The second explosion?Nobodys sure yet.The pilot says there was a fuel dump down there, in one of the old mine chambers.His theory is that the fire must have burned through.She thinks through the unfolding stages of crisis, understands how it could have happened.There is one small mercy, at least: that she already knew about this place, was already on her way here with Jonah, has already used the hours they spent halted by flashing lights and barricades further down the mountain to begin to manage the disaster.There will be no leadership gap within which rumors can circulate, no delay in the actions she must take.The damage can be limited, contained.How fortunate.A thought strikes her.Did she know?Sorry?The gem girl, the prototype.Did she know I was coming today?What?I dont know.Why would she?But they might have told her, I suppose...She feels her jaw tighten as she files the question away.One more piece of a puzzle she senses she may never solve.It hardly matters, not anymore.Time to get to work.She steps well inside the damage zone and turns in a cool, deliberate circle, making it plain she is watching as the heads of assembled officialdom snap around.To her left a big man in a soot stained firefighters uniform with a badge on the chest, to her right a small woman with a police captains epaulets.As one they break off their conferences with subordinates and stride determinedly in her direction, a pincer movement.Good.Let them come to her, the better to understand who is now in charge here.She strolls a few steps forward and stops to wait, ignoring first the murmur and then the hush, glancing around at the wasteland as though conducting her own investigation.Near her feet, more twisted metal.Gold this time, bright lights picking out the gleam through the rust rainbow patina left by the explosion.Letters, a sign still legible despite the damage.From the size and where it has come to rest she surmises it must have hung above the shattered doors; an announcement, a proclamation.A mockery.Phoenix.Binary       REMNANT       Binary       31 When I was a child, Aryel said, I used to hear the researchers talk about the fertility problem.Sometimes they called it the Phoenix problem.It was something they said I had inherited.A lot of the tests they did on me when I was little had to do with it, but as the years went by they talked about it less and less.When I was older and broke into my own files, I found out that Id been born without ova, although I didnt really understand what that meant at the time.But it wasnt until Eli found the memos that I put two and two together.You see, I also knew that theyd tried to clone me, over and over, and always failed.Theyd make it through the first few hundred cell divisions, and then...She blew a raspberry.Eli found the crude expression out of keeping with her usual grace, and thoroughly endearing.They were in her vertiginous living room, himself and Mikal and Reginald and Herran and Gwen, draped over the furniture in the exhausted sprawl of puppets who have had their strings cut.Even Herran was sitting back a bit, tablet largely dormant on his lap.Midnight had come, and long since gone.From where he sat, slumped with his head tipped back on a sofa, Eli could see shreds of cloud whip by on the dying eddies of the storm, dark and ragged against the night sky.And that was the same story with Zavcka?Mikal asked.His arms were extended along the back of another sofa, hands drooping over the ends, and his legs stuck so far out in front of him that they were almost hanging off the edge of the drop.So much for engineering out imperfections.You have to remember what an early stage gemtech science was at.The clock was ticking for Jarek and his wife: She had the Syndrome, they knew she only had a few years left to live.Whether he intentionally tampered with the embryo beyond what was necessary to try to make their child Syndrome safe or whether it was just an accident of the early technology, I dont think well ever know.But at some point Jarek and Zavcka discovered that she had come with two extra features: She couldnt conceive and she didnt age.They may have believed she was literally immortal.Can you imagine?The holy grail of human desire: never to age and never to die.Only if you cant have children you cant pass that gift on, and if you cant clone yourself you cant even create another you for company.Theres no one to live forever with.Im not sure thats ever bothered Zavcka as much as it bothered Jarek, but I think it consumed him.One of his reasons for creating Phoenix was to try to solve the problem.And Phoenix created you.And Phoenix created me.Not on purpose, I hasten to add.They were experimenting with cross species splicing, seeing how far the reparative aspects of the mutation could be pushed.They didnt expect the batch to be viable.It worked, though, didnt it?What worked?Jareks plan.He rolled his head toward her, his tone droll.Phoenix created you, and you have fulfilled his mission.Zavckas going to have company for the rest of her life, however long that is.Granted, its probably not quite what he had in mind...She chuckled wearily.No, Im sure its not.Shes already begging them not to make her own story public, to keep pretending shes Zavcka the Second.Got her lawyers all over it.Why care?I think there are a few reasons, Herran.One, shes spent a long time being afraid of what would happen if people found out: of how they might try to take advantage of her, not to mention uncovering all the ways shes used it to take advantage of others.Two, she would have had to do a lot of manipulation of the family assets to remove them from the identity she was leaving behind, and transfer them into the identity she was creating.If Zavcka the Second is acknowledged not to exist, she risks losing control of a vast fortune.Its still hers, remember, even though shell be in prison, and she might yet outlive whatever sentence they give her.And three, to admit it means admitting she is highly engineered, that she is the thing shes spent her entire life looking down on.Gem.Exactly.Whatll happen now?asked Gwen.She was uncharacteristically subdued, though Eli supposed it was understandable under the circumstances.To BelNatur?The research they were doing with Herran, andand everything else?Aryel raised an eyebrow at Eli, a gentle hint that he had managed to sink himself into the cushions and avoid being part of the conversation for quite long enough.He pushed himself wearily upright.The company will continue, he said.Shes a major shareholder, but not the only one.And we want it to, because the deal Herran made with them still stands.The infotech program has real potential, but itll need very stringent public oversight.Now that we know what her intentions were, the gatekeepers need to be on guard.Complete transparency.He shifted, trying to get comfortable again, and jerked his chin at Mikal.Thats your area, Councillor.Indeed.All that time I spent in their ethics committee meetings might not be wasted after all.Of course, he mused, staring at the ceiling, snapping his fingers with both thumbs in a softly syncopated quadruple beat, pimping myself, my wife, an oblique promise to divert a police investigation, and a truly absurd scheme to bring back gemtech may not be the best advertisement of my fitness for the role.Weary laughter from everyone but Herran, who blinked his gray eyes solemnly at them.Im not sure it was that absurd, Aryel murmured.What did Masoud say?Masoud was apoplectic.I think its his reaction to a tactic that he cant possibly approve of, even though he thinks its really, really cool.Is Sharon going to be in trouble, do you think?What, for drafting in two civilians, one a seriously ill young man with no experience of police work and an inclination to go rogue, and the other an unorthodox city councillor to whom she just happens to be married?Shes already offered him her badge.He asked what the hell he was supposed to do with it.I have another question, Ari, said Gwen, though she sounded hesitant.Her tablet was also on her knee, inactive but near at hand.She trailed a thoughtful finger over the blank surface.You can have as many as you like.What is it?Im not going to shout at you and Da for letting us think you were with him for years and years before he rescued us.Not yet.Im too tired and theres too much going on.But I want to know something.Thank you for not shouting.Yet.What do you want to know?What were we for?An expectant quiet then.It was, Eli realized, one of the few remaining mysteries.For some.He saw Reginald close his eyes and shake his head a little, as though in resignation.What do you think, Gwennie?I think a lot of things.I want you to tell me.Aryel sighed, and pushed back her hair.She had loosened it again and it fell heavy around her shoulders and over the arches of her wings.Eli saw the metal clasp glint in her fingers as she gestured helplessly at the air.You were meant to be combat models, she said.Soldiers.Ive thought so for some time, and I suspect well find confirmation in the Phoenix archive once Herran finishes resurrecting it.It was the big thing around twenty five years agothere were endless, nasty wars all across North Africa and the Middle East, all the tribal factions trying to secure what was left of their fossil fuel reserves.Plus flare ups in South America and Southeast Asia that looked as though they might go the same way.The military focus was cybernetics, and they tried that too, but I think Panborn was clever enough to realize that if no one could make mechanical grafts work then whoever turned out a literal superhumanspeed, strength, agility, night vision, acute hearing, proximity awareness, high operational IQ, all the things you and Rhys havecould make a killing.She heard herself, and winced.Sorry.Poor choice of word.Its okay.Thats...thats kind of what I thought.She was silent for a moment, picking at a pillow on her lap, the waiting tablet still on her knee.It doesnt matter if thats what they meant us for, as long as its not what we are.Its just...as long as nobody thinks thats what we are.What Rhys did...What Rhys did saved his and Callans lives, and quite possibly Ellyns as well.Its a miracle he was able to do it at all, the effort must have been...Aryel trailed off, shaking her head.Theres no way he could have controlled his own strength, not in that state.The doctors will confirm it.Therell be an investigation, there has to be, but dont worry about it.No one will hold it against him or you.Good, she whispered.Now I have a question for you.Have you spoken to Lyriam?What on earth do I say to him, Ari?Having dropped him in the pot, rumbled Reginald, you might want to let him know whether youll be leaving him there to stew on his own.Da.Or fishing him out, or joining him.Extra spice never went amiss.Da!What?Its only what everyone else is saying.Grins, guilty snickers, and meaningful glances shot around the dim room.Dont get me wrong, hes a nice lad.I like him.But its a shame theres only one Callan.Eli had been perplexed to discover, when they were finally able to make their way to the hospital, that the crowd of newstream journalists and socialstream commentators ranked outside was not only several times larger than it had been at police headquarters, but also far less interested in them.They were there for Gwen, who rumor declared to be at her sick brothers bedside.Or not.He heard one hack excitedly reporting a piece of half heard gossip, to the effect that it was Lyriam over whom she watched, laid low by the violent hysterics of his newly ex girlfriend.As he and Mikal made their way in with Herran trotting along between them, microphones and vidcams were thrust at them from every direction; but the scandal they were being asked to comment on had nothing to do with BelNatur, Zavcka Klist, or Aryel Morningstar.What on earth, he said, as they finally made it through the crowd and into the hospitals foyer, is going on?Somethings happened to Lyriam?Oh, a great deal has happened to Lyriam, said Mikal, and I hope he has his head on straight enough to handle it.You havent heard?No, I suppose you wouldnt have.You either, Herr?I thought you always kept an eye on the streams, no matter what.The little gems head, shoulders, and torso swayed precisely forward and back in his signature emphatic rocking nod.Streams say Gwen did a bad thing.Also Lyriam.Also Bethany.Also Lyriam did a good thing, and Gwen, and Bethany.Its very confused, Mikal sighed, as they took the stairs up to the next floor, having all apparently decided, by mutual and unspoken agreement, to avoid the elevators wherever they could.I havent quite worked out the details...Lyriam playing with Gwen, Bethany not know.Aryel calls Gwen, come quick quick for Rhys.Gwen goes quick quick.So quick people at music place find out.Tell Bethany, tell streams.People at music place find out what?Eli asked, thinking that even after two weeks of being almost constantly in his company, decrypting Herrans tortured syntax was as difficult as any other mystery he had had to unravel.Gwen and Lyriam playing.But they would have known they were playing together.He doesnt mean, said Mikal, waiting for them from where his longer legs had carried him, half a flight further up, that kind of playing.What kind?Oh.Oh indeed.As far as I can make out they were in some kind of break room, and when Aryel told Gwen what was going on at BelNatur she got out of there so fast she left poor Lyriam with his pants down.Literally.Oh god.Eli could picture it, and had to fight back the urge to dissolve in hysterical laughter.Burst out past a bunch of musicians, who would probably have kept their mouths shut, and a gaggle of studio flunkeys who unfortunately didnt.By the time she got to where I was waiting in the alley, it was all over the streams.Rude jokes from the studio techs, histrionics from Bethany, you can imagine.But then Lyriam went onstream to say he and Bethany had split up a couple of days after the concert in the park, he hadnt made an announcement because its a personal matter, and he wanted to be as sensitive to her as possible, give her time to make the adjustment and tell people in her own way.Pointed out that they havent been seen together since then, and the people close to them all knew.It had been in the cards for some time, long before he met Gwen.So on and so forth.His friends are piling in to confirm that this is true, hers to say its not.Fucking hell.Where does this leave Gwen, then?Everywhere from cold hearted home wrecker to innocent caught in the crossfire.And I do mean everywhere.He jerked a pair of thumbs over his shoulder, vaguely in the direction from which they had come.Witness the media mle.Oh well, its not like this family has anything else to deal with just now.Does Aryel know?I dont know.Dont see how shed have found the time, but she always manages to know a bit more than seems reasonable, doesnt she?It was said without a hint of rancor, a simple statement of fact that Eli knew for truth.And indeed there she was when they finally found their way to the waiting room on the critical care wing, her straight flight from the station having brought her here more swiftly: standing at the window with an arm around Gwen, her voice a soft murmur of reassurance as they gazed down at the cluster of uplink vans and milling journalists in front of the hospital.She must know that their attentions would turn to her soon enough, and his heart ached at the thought.Herran spent an hour with the genmed team, walking them through the Phoenix genealogy Rhys had constructed, and the genetype data that he had found and matched to it.They were as unused to him as he to them, and the conference would have been impossible without help from Callan.Nothing less than the possibility of finding a cure would have enticed him away from Rhyss side.Its the Syndrome, he said quietly, when they were wrapping up.It is, isnt it?The doctors and geneticists glanced at each other.Its very close, one of them said eventually.Not identical.A variant.But you can fix him.You know enough now.We should be able to design a treatment.That epigenetic suppressant he was given is a good start; if we can get access to the development work on that itll save us a lot of time.It was private research, said Aryel evenly.BelNaturs pharmaceutical division.Ill have it to you by lunchtime tomorrow.You can do that?I mean...I understand the company is in some turmoil at the moment.They probably wont release anything until the lawyers...Herran?They dont give, I get.Quite.Rhys was stable, heavily sedated, and would not be waking up any time before the middle of the morning.They were all urged to go home, get some sleep, and come back then.Callan point blank refused.I might sleep a little here, I wont there.And I dont want to know anything more about anything right now.I just want to be with him.Reginald blinked hard, sniffed, and clapped him on the shoulder, and Gwen hugged him tight, and they left him sitting in the glow of his hair and the winking lights of the monitors, Rhyss hand clasped between both of his own, murmuring sonnets to him in French.Now Gwen chucked the pillow across the room at Reginald, sighed and departed, tablet in hand, while Aryel shook her head reproachfully at him.Thats being a bit hard on her, dont you think?She can take it.You know full well she couldve moved just as fast but with a lot more finesse if shed wanted to.At some level shed decided it was time to get things out in the open.She let Rhys be the excuse, and now shes feeling bad about it.And so she should.Aryel opened her mouth for a rebuttal, considered, and closed it again.Reginald gave a little snort of triumph.Tell me about the girl, their sister.Ellyn.Apart from the burnsand the bellyis she all right?No shes not.Severe brain damage.Aryel rubbed a hand across her brow.Zavcka took great pleasure in telling us that she has a mental age of around four.Eli could remember cases like it, too many, from his studies of the gemtechs.Thats why they put her in a coma.Yep.Hard to tell a rambunctious, immensely powerful toddler that shes seven months pregnant and she needs to take it easy.Shes due in about two weeks, Mikal said.Ive been talking to the doctors.Theyre in a quandary, because normally the ethical thing to do would obviously be to bring her out of it.But the reason Zavcka had her sedated in the first place isI hate to say itits a real reason.Shell be confused and traumatized, she might hurt herself or the baby.Theyll deliver her surgically either way, but theyre thinking it would just compound the atrocity of whats been done to her to wake her up now.I tend to agree.There were murmurs of reluctant assent from Reginald and Aryel, and Eli himself.Herran blinked.The choices that have been left to us, he said in an oddly formal, stilted tone, as though quoting, and then in his normal voice said, Bad.Aryel smiled tiredly across the room at him.Yes, Herr, its another one of those.And the baby is really Zavcka?asked Reginald.The baby is a baby, Aryel said firmly.She isnt anybody yet, and shell get to keep her own mind now.Shell grow up to be herself.How much of the old Zavcka will come through in her, we have no way of knowing.Thats a hell of a thing to be saddled with, though, Eli mused, head tipped back against the cushions again.Itll be a matter of public record, itll be...huge.People will know shes going to grow up, but not grow old.Shell need protecting.The burden of being a Zavcka is going to be no joke, Mikal agreed.Even for a Zavcka.Shell be fine if shes raised right, Reginald grunted.What dyou think, Ari?I might have an idea, she said meditatively.Maybe a solution...a way to keep her safe, from the world and herself...She stifled a yawn.Dont know yet.Need to think it through.Something else Ive been trying to think through, Eli said, keeping his voice as uninflected as he could, is how I found those messages.I checked my searchbot.Nothing special about it, and the search terms I used had nothing to do with KAG or Phoenix.Theres no way it should have been able to find, much less resurrect, much less reconstruct them.He stole a glance across the room at Herran and caught Aryel doing the same thing.The little gems face was as expressionless as ever.Ive been wondering about that myself, Aryel said, and waited.Herran did not react.Mikal had caught their focus and was looking from Eli to Aryel to Herran with puzzled interest, while Reginald grinned and nodded to himself with an air of quiet satisfaction.Herran, said Aryel.You gave Elis searchbot a bit of help, didnt you?Yes.Searchbot stupid.Couldnt find.Whyd you do it like that?Eli asked, perplexed.Why make it look like something Id stumbled over by accident, instead of just telling me?Couldnt.Promised.He blinked solemnly at Aryel.You promised Eli broke off, thinking, pulling the pieces together.You were poking around in the archive for a reason and youd promised not to tell anyone but Aryel what youd found.Yes.Breaking rules.Not supposed to tell.But you told...no, you didnt tell me anyway.You altered the base code of the searchbot so it could find what youd found, and you let it tell me.Yes.Ill be damned, Mikal muttered.He was sitting upright now, and his look of mild surprise had given way to full on amazement.Why, Herran?asked Aryel.She sounded as baffled as Eli had ever heard her, and a little hurt.You knew the messages were about me, you knew there were bad things in them.Why send them to Eli at all?Why didnt you just let me know what youd found?Herran regarded her steadily.You tell Eli?I. ..no, I wouldnt have told Eli.She stared at Herran staring back at her, face blank, long lashes blinking hugely.You...you knew that, didnt you?And you decided he ought to know?Better for you.Aryel, Eli, and Mikal sat in stunned silence.Reginalds grin had turned into a rumbling, delighted chuckle.Thats the truth if ever I heard it.Good on you, Herran.Well played.He took in Aryels astonished expression, and shook with mirth.Very well played indeed.But you cant do that, said Eli, feeling as though the world had tilted once again, and hearing as he said it just how wrong he was.Since when can you do that?Better for Aryel.Better for you too.I do.Well, well.Mikal was back to his own amused, amazed, double lidded blink.Thats very...decisive of you, Herran.I dont think I can remember a day quite so full of miracles and wonders as this one.I hope there arent going to be any more before morning, Im not sure I could take it.He could have been speaking for Eli, but despite his weariness there were puzzles implied by this latest revelation that his brain could not help picking at.What were you looking for in the archive, Herran?When you found the messages?Genetype for Rhys.Herran was matter of fact.Aryel said look, maybe find.Eli turned bodily on the sofa to glare at her.So you already knew KAG had become part of BelNatur.No, I didnt.She had recovered her equanimity somewhat.But I had begun to suspect, because when I was in Zavckas office I noticed something.Theres a framed plaque on the wall, a formal group photograph with the BelNatur logo at the top and then a bunch of smaller logos studded beneath.One of them looked like KAG, and there was a woman in the group who looked a lot like Zavcka.I couldnt see what the plaque was commemoratingit could just have been a piece of family memorabilia shed brought with her.But I thought it could also have come with the office, been a snapshot of BelNatur acquisitions.So I asked Herran, if he decided to go in and work with them, to check if there was a KAG sub directory or any other sign of their genetype files.It only took him a couple of days to be able to tell me there wasnt, which of course, she arched a thoughtful eyebrow in Herrans direction, was entirely true.No more tonight, Herran announced, standing up abruptly.Sleepy.I go to bed.They all regarded him for a second, and then Mikal hauled himself to his feet.That sounds like an excellent idea, he said.Ill walk you down and see if my wife is anywhere close to being able to come home yet.They said their goodnights, and after a while Reginald too drifted off in the direction of the bedrooms, and it was only Eli and Aryel left alone in the vast room, with the first traces of a midsummer dawn beginning to turn the windows pale.Aryel, he said, staring at the ceiling, are you really upset with Herran for sending those messages my way?She gazed out of the window at the lightening sky, shook her head and laughed softly.No.He was right.You needed to know and I needed to not carry it around anymore.Im just struggling to come to terms with the fact that he worked that out when I couldnt.He took this in, feeling it spread warmth throughout his tired body and brain.Rhys must have asked him the same question, mustnt he?About looking for his genetype in the archive.And got the same answer, but also was pointed toward the black hole in the basement.Yes.Before tonight I would have assumed that Rhys just asked better questions than me, but now...she trailed off, musing, or maybe too weary to think her way through the enormity of what Herran had done; and what it meant for him, as well as for Rhys and Eli and herself.The little gem had understood his friends, had known what they needed, and had taken the initiative on their behalfto a far greater degree than any of them could ever have imagined possible.You going to try and get some sleep?he asked her quietly, watching her profile against the light.I couldnt.Think Ill go up to the garden, watch the sun come up.You?No chance.Want some company?Yes, please.They gathered up blankets and made their way along the perimeter walkways to the door.As they let themselves quietly into the corridor, Eli said, You never finished telling me, you know.Telling you what?The rest of what happened.After you got out.Ah.She looked up at him, smiling.Well, this is the right place for the rest of that story.She held out a hand and he took it, sliding her slender fingers between his own; and thought, as he walked with her through the sleeping building and up the stairs, that it felt as much like an ending as a beginning.Binary        Phoenix There are lights among the trees, first one and then another; not the harsh searchlights of the retrieval teams but gentler, faint and flickering.She crouches behind the outcrop that conceals her, fifty feet up the side of a cliff once blasted into being by miners many centuries dead.Maybe the same miners who blasted the tunnels and chambers where she has spent her life until this night, the tunnels and chambers she in turn had to blast her way out of.Screams echo faintly in her inner ear and she shudders, clings tighter to the rock behind which she hides, focuses harder on the lights.It is barely a ledge upon which she has alighted, no more than a few scant toe  and finger holds against which she can rest her weight.Her hands and feet tremble with fatigue, along with her newly tried wings, held open and stiff for balance.The sudden, cell deep certainty that came to her on the mountainside, that let her trust them and led her here, feels as ephemeral as a fading dream.She is cold and hungry and afraid, and more tired than she has ever been.And there are lights in the forest below her.Could these be the ones she seeks?They were to have met at the waterfall at sunset, but she is miles downstream of it now and the sun is long gone.Or are they a new troop of hunters, less well equippedor clever enough to appear sobut no less deadly in their intent?Her flight strength is gone; if she moves she must come to earth, show herself and risk all.She dares not.But she cannot hang here forever.A shadow detaches itself from the trees and moves into the clearing before the cliff.The shielded light dances at hip height, then sweeps cautiously around the clearing.She cannot see who holds it.But she hears the murmur of voices, and more lights advance.The one who came forward first is silhouetted in their glow, tall but oddly ill defined.Details emerge slowly, as he comes closer and her eyes adjust: shaggy brown hair and beard, a long, shapeless coat.Boots wrapped in cloth, muffled.A worried squinting into the darkness, an uncertainty that mirrors her own as he peers past her along the overgrown access road that runs at the base of the cliff.And then startled oaths and a general scramble backward, flashlights flickering madly, as she kicks away from the cliff wall and spreads and flaps her aching wings.Her landing is clumsy and she stumbles, catching herself on both hands and one knee, feeling the scrape of gravel.Then she is upright and facing them, arms and wings wrapped around her shivering torso, hoping desperately that her calculations will prove right just one more time.A long, long, long moment as she stands in the joined beams of the flashlights, while the shadows behind them gasp and exclaim and call on gods she does not know.She had not realized how much she would shock them.She is down to the last shreds of her composure when the tall man steps forward again.He holds two flashlights now, one on her and one to illuminate himself.Aryel?She nods, finds herself barely able to speak.She licks dry lips, swallows, pulls herself together.Yes.Areare you Reginald?The man nods in his turn.It occurs to her that he may be as tongue tied as she is, and the thought gives her comfort.The lines of his mouth are firm, grim, but there is a kindness in his eyes and his voice, when he finds it.We were delayed.Im sorry.Are you all right?No, wait, lets get under cover.He is ushering her beneath the canopy of trees.She is surrounded by them now, still indistinct in the night darkness, still muttering imprecations, and she bites back a surge of fear.The decision to trust these people has already been made.She has no choice but to follow it through.Im sorry were so late, Reginald is saying again.We were having a hard time avoiding the retrieval teams, we had to cut inside them.We were closest when it happened...we had to go and see if there was anyone we could help...When what happened?she says, feeling as she once did, as though something crucial is just beyond her grasp.Help who?Whoever we could.But the only ones we found alive were these two.He turns, the beam of his flashlight swinging onto a woman who crouches at the base of a tree, looking up at them.Her mouth is a tight line and her arms curve around a large, lobed bundle.It moves under the light.Sleepy eyes, blue black as the deepening sky, peek out over folds of blanket; first two to the left, then two to the right.There is a ruby shimmer to the soft curls that cover their heads.The tiny, soot smudged faces are more alike than any two faces she has ever seen, but instinct tells her the more solemn faced of the pair is a boy, and the one who purses her little lips doubtfully is a girl.The children stare at her and cuddle closer together.Reginald clears his throat.They seem to be the only ones who got out.Besides you, of course.No, she says stupidly.Everyone got out.I knew we wouldnt all get away, but I made sure everyone was outside before I left.The men and women shift and glance at each other, and the murmurs rise again.The children whimper and squirm, and for the first time she notices the smell of smoke pouring off them, hanging heavy on the people around her, drifting through the trees like a fog.And she realizes, with a mounting sense of dread, that something has happened, something more than she knows, more than she planned.They explain it to her gently, as gently as they can, and she knows the tears that prick against her eyelids are as much a reaction to their kindness as grief for the unknown siblings that she has lost.That she has killed.It wasnt your fault, Reginald says, over and over again.You mustnt blame yourself.But she knows he is wrong.The knowledge pins her mind into a stunned immobility during the forced march through the forest to where the vehicles have been hidden.She is numb with it, sick with it.Whenever she looks up at Reginalds broad back leading the way she sees the baby boys eyes blinking back at her over his shoulder, silent, accusing.It is on the long, jolting journey in the back of an ancient open backed transport, with the twins clinging silently to each other, and only for the barest of moments to her, that a thread of the song that sang her free returns; gossamer thin and trembling, but a thing to hold on to through the cold and tear soaked night.She clutches tight and listens hard, and watches the little ones, and thinks of what they flee and what they face, and the part she has had in it, and the part she must have in it.The stars burn down on her, and she asks them questions, and they answer.By the time they reach their destination she knows who she is, and what the price of her freedom must be.She goes to Reginald, walking unchallenged through the mountaintop camp.Together they watch the sun rise through a mist tinged pink and gold, and she tells him.And he listens gravely, and nods agreement, and gives her a new name.Morningstar.
