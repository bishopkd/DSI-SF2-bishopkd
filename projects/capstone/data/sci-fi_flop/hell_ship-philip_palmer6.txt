The entire planet          was black and all the land animals sheltered in their cabins; the aquatics in the lake and rivers slowed to a sluggish pace          in their swimming; the aerials cowered in their nests.Only a few, just a very few, of the echo locating species ventured          abroad, and even they were wary.I crouched on the high plateau and listened to the sounds of the night, and at length I heard a sound I recognised: a wild          howling.It was Cuzco, baying at the stars, except there were no stars.I spent twelve cycles on the mountain tops gliding from peak to peak, following the sound of the howls; and then one day I          found my friend.Youve changed, I told Cuzco.Cuzco snorted, and I felt the heat of his flames on my soft outer skin.There was a wild look in his eyes.He did not speak.Ive missed you, I said.Cuzcos claws scratched the hard rock.I had no choice.I had to banish you.I said.Otherwise Cuzco roared at me.Id never heard his roar from so close.It was a scream that possessed his whole body.He was a fierce looking          creature at the best of timeswith a hide made of sharp spikes and horns erupting from his skull.And the furnace of his bodythe          inner heat that allowed him to spit and exhale flamemade the patches of hide that were visible beneath his body armour glow.And yet I knew that Cuzco, in his best moments, had a generous and a gentle spirit.And, too, as well as his killing claws,          he had fingers that were supple and soft and could be used to manipulate tools, or create great art works, or stroke, affectionately,          a subordinate being.Have you become insane?I asked Cuzco calmly, and he snorted again, and spat fire over me and I was engulfed in flame.Once more my soft skin burned away; and I clenched my extremities into my core, and my shell joints instinctively sealed and          I allowed the fire to burn down before my head re emerged.You are indeed, I concluded, insane.Cuzco laughed.Not so.You murdered Djamrock.We made a bargain.An insane bargain.Cuzco snorted again, and acid dripped out of his eye sockets.This body language I knew; he was laughing.Im tired of stories, said Cuzco, as the sun set, and the blackness descended again.Then tell me no stories.I find your company irksome.I love to irk.You succeed triumphantly, you ugly sentimental shittier than an arsehole monstrosity.Now I recall why Ive missed you; your squalid absence of a personality makes me feel much finer and wiser by comparison.A spurt of acid dripped out of Cuzcos eyeballs; he was laughing again.We were silent together a while.A long while.I should return, I said.To my cabin.Why?Because I have a life down there.Then go, you ignorant stealer of space that might be occupied by my shadow.Perhaps I shall.Did you really think I would be glad to see you?Are you?Youre a grotesque viler than turds in my eyeballs monstrosity.But are you?Glad?Yes.I did not think you would be glad.After all You fought a noble fight, and bested me.No fight is noble, I said derisively.I thought you were a coward.I aspire to be so.Youre not a coward.I sighed, from my tentacle tips.I rehearsed my speech about pacifism, and why it is preferable to blood lust, but decided          not to waste my breath.You fight like a grazing animal whose grotesque teats are the size of a baby Challs head, I informed him.He snorted; the air burned; acid dripped from his eyes; laughing again.Why did you come?Cuzco asked.I was worried about you.You beat me into bloodiness and had me dumped on a high cold mountain top; and you were worried?I thought you might be lonely.Cuzco looked out at the view: the world was far below; we were atop a remote icy crag surrounded by sheer cliffs.Fair guess, he conceded.Are you lonely?No.Good, Im glad, I said.And yet, Cuzco acknowledged grudgingly, yes.As I suspected.Admit it, said Cuzco, The only reason youre here isyou cant live without me, can you, you ingratiating slime fucker?I waved my tentacles scornfully, disparaging such a ridiculous idea.Its true!snorted Cuzco, scalding my cheeks with plumes of hot air from his skull.You care about me, you actually have          feelings for me, dont you?In that sad pathetic cock sucking arsehole kissing clingy way of yours.Admit it, you soft as shit expelled from my bowels          worm!I was convulsed by a sudden unexpected paroxysm; my body was attacked from within by an unfamiliar choking feeling; my emotions          clashed and collided; and I exhaled stale air from my rectum, violently and loudly.What happened then?said Cuzco, alarmed.It is the way my species, I said, amused, expresses affection and abiding love.Cuzco glared at me, and acid dripped out of his eyes again: And youre not extinct ?I knew all Cuzcos stories, his tales of valour and loves lost and battles fought and great deeds performed in faster than light          space ships that carried his kind amongst the stars.But over the next few weeks, he told me all the stories again, and I listened rapt and fascinated, and then I told mine.I talked of how my people first learned to fly through space; and how we danced and mated among the stars; and how we gave          birth in caves and cherished our young.And I talked too of the day my father took me to the moon of Shallomar, perched on          his back as he flew through vacuum.Did you love your father?Cuzco asked.Of course I did.I replied.Cuzco sighed; I suspected he felt a pang of jealousy.And you?Did you love your father?I asked, intrigued.Or, rather, do your species leave their aged parents out in the desert to die the moment they          begin to forget occasional facts?As the Frayskind, so lamentably, do.We do not do such a thing.But love?Did you love him?No, I did not love him, Cuzco said, soberly.He was a cruel tyrant; such as fathers are meant to be.My mother too was          brutal to me; she taught me through pain, and taught me well, the evil bitch.I find that sad.Do not pity me!said Cuzco angrily.Our people do have love.We love many things.Name one thing that you love, that doesnt involve ripping the throat out of a vulnerable fellow creature?Cuzco thought hard, clearly angry at my words.We love our comrades in arms, he said proudly, and would happily die for them, and they for us!And we love our sexual          partners too.Yes, we do!With a rare and overwhelming passion!Or rather, we love them until we tire of them, and find their          breath stale and loathsome, and then we feel compelled to batter them and seek fresh fucks.But for a while at least, thenyes,          romantic loveI do know the meaning of that joy!!Hmm, I said.But as for children, continued Cuzco, well, thats a different thing entirely.For I did not know a parent could love a          child, and a child a parent, until I came to this place.Thats sad, I concluded, having won my case, I felt, beyond all doubt.No its not.Its normal, Cuzco said, stubbornly.For my kind.I had always believed, I admitted, it was a universal thing.That all species know the joy of love, even the violent ones.Not Doros kind.Fair point.His species are single sex.Perhaps he loves himself ?Cuzco suggested.That is not true love, it is just vanity.And Frayskind?Do they know love?Who could love a Frayskind!The great lumbering oaf!I suggested.Yet magnificent too, Cuzco argued.In her way, perhaps.Certainly loyal; and a good friend; unless you are a mischievous Frayskind teen, then Fray would eat          you alive.Give us credit; my kind are not great parents, but we do not eat our young.You swallow sentient bipeds, I said accusingly.Cuzco chuckled; an eerie sound.Only when they are young and fresh; the older kind are chewy.You immoral beast!You should try it.Biped haunch.It has a tang.And so it went on; we threw out ideas, exchanged memories, mused on the peculiarities of the strange other species with whom we inhabited this ship, told jokes, teased each other, and talked endless nonsense that amused us both.Cuzco and I were far from kindred spirits.His kind were fierce, wrathful, brutal, murderous, and cared for nothing more than          honour, which they defined as the ability to kill or to die with skill and grace.While my kind were timid, pacifist, cowardly          in his eyes; but full of an unquenchable love for others and for life itself.But we had one thing in common: our need for each other.For I needed him, desperately and limitlessly.And he needed me too,          with the same crazy intensity.And the bond it created dwarfed any love I had ever known.CuzcoI would fight and die in war for you!Thats how much I love you.Why did you do it?The fight with Djamrock?He begged me to.You thought youd win?Cuzco sighed wearily.Yes that was my plan.Could you have endured it?An eternity without body?An eternity of joy.Knowing I had died with honour.You would have abandoned me?We are all alone, said Cuzco.Love is an illusion.He was right.Love is an illusion.And so is hope.But are illusions really so very bad?Where did you learn to fight like that?Cuzco asked one night, after we had spent a day flying on the updrafts above the          highest summits.I never learned, I admitted.I had never fought a battle until I arrived on the Hell Ship.But in the early days, there were two huge combats, which I won.That is why the world is          as it is.Because I fought, and won, and claimed obedience.Before my time?asked Cuzco.Before your time.I thought Djamrock was the leader of the world.Or Miaris.They were the dominant predators.When they spoke, all listened.They listened; but Djamrock and Miaris never said anything that wasnt nonsense.My words mattered.Yes but What?You spoke to us all, true, and often we heeded you; but no one feared you.I did not want anyone to fear me.Cuzco thought about that.Explain how you can fight, he said, if your kind are not predators.Once, I said, telling the tale of my people: Once, the oceans of our world were ruled by a magnificent and beautiful sentient species called Tula.Tula means all in          my language; the Tula were our all.We were their symbiotes, their slaves.They were born as soft sea creatures, and developed          a calcareous exoskeleton to become underwater reefs as they aged.The ocean bed was ruled by them; the ocean bed was them.And they fed us and taught us, and in return we protected them.These are not legends; this is the archaeological biology of my kind.We were giant plant eating sea creatures with tentacles          and a cape and the ability to expand our bodies to appear more threatening than we were.Then we formed a symbiosis with the          Tula and we used our fearsome aspect to discourage predators who liked to eat the soft Tula flesh inside their bony frame.Browsing sea creatures like the Uoolsa and the Jaybkok could eat an entire Tula reef in a single sitting; but they were wary          of us.But as time went by the predators grew more bold and they began to eat my kind, before consuming our Tula hosts.So we learned to fight, using our tentacles as weapons to choke and          our quillsour sexual organs, for males and females alikeas weapons.And the Tula, who were sentient, saw what we were doing and they cleverly decided to breed us.They paired us in combinations          that amplified certain traits: size, strength, toughness of carapace, deadliness of our quills and so on.All this took place over many tens of thousands of years; but selective breeding can be a remarkably effective process.We          became fighting monsters, strong and remorseless.And so the Tula were safe, for we guarded them; and were bred to do so with          terrifying effect.Then the oceans started to die and we fled to the land.And there, with our bodies equipped for war, we struggled to survive.We became sentient.And when we became sentient, we became pacifist.That is when my species was truly born; when we began          to think.The Tula were no more; we were alone on hostile land.And our minds developed; but our bodies did not.Our fighting weapons          did not de evolve.We retained the atavistic ability to wage total war, though we chose never to do so.It is a freak of nature, no more, Cuzco.I take no pride in it.I am proud of my intellect, my compassion, my empathy.But          the fact I have a body that can kill with effortless skill means nothing to me.It is just a freak of nature.It means you are a warrior!Cuzco said.Oh you forsaken by the gods eater of hot smelly shit from the arse of a Frayskind idiot, do you not hear anything I say?I said to Cuzco, using one of his favourite insults; and he laughed.Night fell and we were enveloped in total blackness.We talked some more.I told him of my many friends in the days of my pre metamorphosis childhood, and of my brothers and sisters who I had loved.He talked of his home planet and his wife (his third, whom at that point he still found sweet          and had not yet rejected or battered) who he had tried and failed to protect from the Dreaded.We were masters of our world, he said.And then the skies turned red.We are creatures of fire and they used fire against          us.It rained flame, day after day after day.The forests were consumed.The seas boiled dry.Mountain tops were seared.But          we hid in caves and underground tunnels and we launched our space fleets against the invaders.My father was one hundred of our years old and he was Admiral of the fleet.He and his warriors perished.Then the fires          on the surface of our planet died out.The smoke settled.We emerged from our caves to face our invaders.But they never came.They defeated us, but they never faced us.It was the greatest of dishonours.I was sent to investigate the fleets emergency base, on the largest of our two moons.We had cable links with both the moons,          we could fly back and forth on strings as thin as an ankle, as strong as the armour of a god.It was, indeed, a strange, unsettled          time.Our space ships had been incinerated, our satellite stations had been exploded, but the planet itself remained un invaded.Some of us speculated this was not an alien attack at all, just a series of natural catastrophes.And that the presence of          an alien space ship in our stellar system was simply a massive coincidence.But then I arrived on the moon, which we had engineered to give it a breathable atmosphere, and found scenes of carnage.This had been an old style battle to the death.Tens of thousands of my people were scattered on the ground, dead and ripped          to shreds by claws and talons and teeth.Blood lay in vast pools and insects drank it.I realised our invaders were motivated          by a love of battle.They had incinerated our fleets to remove the threat to their spaceship, and they had bathed our planet          in fire to prevent us from reinforcing the forces on the moon.But the war on our moon was the purpose of their invasion.It had been a battle to dwarf all battles; no weapons were used; no burn marks or bullet holes could be          found upon the corpses.It was all done with swords and daggers and claws and teeth and hooves, in bitter unarmed combat;          the Dreaded were, I realised, just like us.They loved to fight, and they loved to kill.And I was so ashamed Sai ias.For I realised at that moment, as I walked among the corpses of the dead, that we had been exterminated by our own          twin.I could only think of one other species who could have acted so cruelly, so bloodthirstily, so savagely; and that was          my own.And I wondered at that moment if we had been subjected to this doom by a just god who was mocking us for our own sins.And, thus humbled, I stood among the bloodied corpses of the last survivors of the Battle of the Moon of Karboam and I howled          to the stars, in grief, and sorrow.And then I woke and I was on the Hell Ship.I never saw the creature who captured me, and who rendered me unconscious.I          went from hell to Hell Ship.That is my story, and I have told it often.And I have heard it often.And I have never admitted before how I felt shame.I knew, I said, I knew.I realised that my body was trembling; and Cuzco was uttering strange tiny grunts; sad and pathetic          and involuntary.The tokens of his deep inner grief.Your father, I asked.What was he like?Magnificent.His wing span dwarfed mine.He sired twenty children, and I was the youngest and the least despised.He was          an explorer and a scientist, and discovered many species of sentient life in the depths of space, and catalogued them all          with care.But first and foremost he was a warrior, and a bloodthirsty butcher, and so was I.  But does that make us unfit          to live?Did we truly deserve to be exterminated, the way we were?I cannot answer, I said, remembering all Cuzcos tales; and the stories of the four species of sentient bipeds his people had tormented, and slaughtered, and eventually eradicated.Perhaps we did, Cuzco continued.Perhaps the god of our universe judged us; and perhaps his judgement was fair.Not so, I murmured, not so.I did not believe in a god of the universe; an arbiter of justice.I did however believe that Cuzcos kind were murderous          monsters who deserved most of what they got.For evil will always breed evil.However, I said none of this to Cuzco; he had suffered enough.And so we lay there in the dark, hearing each others breaths, bathed in each others sorrow.And I stroked Cuzcos body with          my tentacles and I felt a strange desire come upon me.What are you doing?he asked.Cant you guess?I asked, lightly.He was silent for a little while.And then for a longer while.Ah, he said, eventually.Would you like to?I asked.Is it possible?For us?Cuzco said.Others have managed.Perhaps we could try, Cuzco conceded.Touch me some more.I touched him some more.I am becoming aroused, Cuzco admitted, and shifted his body.I touched him some more.He sighed with pleasure.What can I do for you?he asked.Nothing.Nothing at all?No, I said gently.But I have to be able to satisfy you!Bring you towhat is for you a climax?This is all the climax I need.For my kind can eat the joy of others, I explained.And at that moment, he howled to the black skies; and I howled too.We could stay here for ever, I told him, many glorious hours later.Up in the mountains.The Kaun dont care.I feel happy, said Cuzco, and he purred.I feel happy too.We lay together in the pitch black, all night long; and I listened to the sound of his breathing.And I thought about the first time I met Cuzco.He had been dumped by the Kaun on the savannah and he had reacted to his          plight with rage and violence.He attacked all who came near him; and his behaviour was so aggressive that eventually all          the giant sentients steered clear of him.He burned a forest down out of malice and pique; he tried to fly off the planet          and crashed agonisingly into the false sky; and he refused to speak to any of us for months.Even so, I tried, every day, to build a relationship with him, though he treated me always with a vitriolic rudeness that          made Sharrock seem gallant by comparison.When I tried to comfort him he swore at me.He called me a coward and a bitch and          a whore and an ugly abominationand worse, far worse.But beneath the rage I sensed there was real anguish.And so I persevered.And then one day, as I was about to depart from his tirade of abuse, Cuzco had ceased raging and, in some embarrassment, asked          me to stay.And I did.And then he shared with me some of his stories of loss and grief.And from that day on we were friends, of sorts.Despite our friendship however, he continued to be brutal and scatologically insulting towards me; for that was Cuzcos way          of showing affection.It lacked nuance in my view; and yet deep down I knew, or rather I suspected, or to be candid I hoped,          that he did care.And there had certainly been, for all this time, something between us.And that something had sustained me over these many years.Until        His breathing stopped.After two hours, the sun rose again and I could see for certain that Cuzco had died of Despair.His body was petrified; a frozen statue.I touched him and his hide was icy.His heart was still.No bodily life remained.His soul was still in there somewhere, but I would never speak to him again.I howled at the stars, as Cuzco would have done.But there were still no stars.Then I glided home; and I left Cuzcos petrified body on the icy mountain peak, where the snows would fall on it, and where          birds would peck at it, until one day his body would crack into a million pieces.Hell Ship           Explorer/Jak For those few minutes after the Death Ship destroyed all the stars, we were the last particle of reality in the universe that          used to contain the richest and most beautiful civilisation thatwell, that I have ever known.And then we escaped.We rifted through the nexus of all the realities which I later learned was called the Source.The region          of space where all the many universes were, once, spawned.And found ourselves in another universe.Much like our own.Stars.Planets.Civilisations.All were to be found here.I saw it all through Explorers eyes and remote sensors; and I tried not to think back to what I had lost.Any trace of the ship?I asked Explorer.None.The news was dire.But I could not bear to linger on it.Instead, I focused on the one positive thing: I was alive.And so for one glorious moment I savoured what it was to be alive!The moment passed.The corpses?They have not yet decayed.Let me see them.Give me access to the Hub cameras.No.I insist.No purpose will be served.We need to plan.And so we did.My name is Jak.I was, once, a Trader.But that was many years ago.Too many years ago to count.And indeed very many of those yearswell, I can no longer recollect          them.For the actual memories of much of what I have done, I have to rely upon the computer mind which is part of my consciousness          and my being, but which still feels alien to me.I was once a Trader.Then I was the Master of an Explorer vessel.And now I am a Star Seeker.I!A meremale.But that is          my destiny and my curse.And, for anyone who can hear, or read, or decode this message bound into the ripples of reality, here is my story.It is a tale too long to be told in full.Some of I have already told you about, or parts of it at least; the experiences          and companions that burn bright in my memorythe wretched FanTangs, Averil, Mohun, my betrayal and flight from the Trader          Fleet, Albinia, the ship, Phylas, Morval, Galamea, the shocking genocide of the FanTangs.Some of it however        I was mad for five hundred years, and that is when I lost most of my memories.During that time Ino, that cannot be recalled.We pursued the Death Ship.We encountered manyno, too much, too much.I am drowning in years, and half forgot horrors.But there was a particular moment when it all changed.When my old self died and the new self was born.I can recollect that          much.It happened soon after we arrived in our first new universe, after pursuing the Death Ship, and failing to find it.It was          when Explorer explained to me her dark plan.It was a coldly logical plan; but driven by some kind of strange machine mind passion.I can only suppose that Explorers          programs were designed to ensure she never faltered in pursuit of revenge for a wrong done against Olara.I was the flaw, you see.I was nothing but a weak, injured, fallible organic creature who lacked the necessary strength to          endure the mission ahead of us.We Olarans are a long lived species; we can live many hundreds of years.But like all that          is flesh, eventually we decline and die.But in the current circumstances, Explorer had remorselessly explained to me, death was not an option.Because, to pursue the Death Ship, she told me, we needed time.Time to search.Time to seek for clues.Time that might well          be measured in aeons not mere years.The Death Ship it seemed could travel for ever through the many universes; and so must          we.But I had lost limbs, I had suffered internal injuries.And rather than healing me, and coaxing a few more centuries out of          me, Explorer wanted to replace my body parts with more robust alternatives.A metal heart; a nervous system made of robotic          components; eyes that saw through Explorers eyes; a mind that co existed at all times with Explorers mind.Explorer wanted to let my body die, and yet keep my mind and my rage intact.And meanwhile, as all this was discussed and decided, all around me the corpses of Phylas and Morval and Galamea and Albinia          were rotting.Microbes in the air fed upon them; their flesh had turned to mush.But in due course Explorer would use the          water jets to sluice their flesh away.And then she would drain the oxygen to kill the microbes.And then she and I would          be immortal.Why do you need me?I recalled vividly asking her that question.Why do you need me?You could take revenge alone.You could let me die and still pursue the Death Ship.Her reply had chilled me, crippled and despairing as I was.The answer to your question is: I do not need you, Jak.You contribute little to the running of this ship.Your mind is weak.Your resolve is feeble.Your body is dying, from inevitable age and             from your terrible injuries.My sole purpose now is to take revenge for what these creatures did to the Olara, and for this             I do not need you at all.Then why do you want me?Revenge is not enough, Star Seeker Jak.Someone must bear witness to that revenge.And that must be you.For you are the last Olaran left, in all the universes.So bear witness, Jak.That             is your task, and your inexorable duty.Explorers plan was a good one; and so I agreed to it.And thus I died.And I also survived.There was nothing left of the old me now, except for the brain of Jak connected to the ships mechanical mind.Explorer repaired the hull and all her damaged machinery and weapons and restored the engines to their full power again.She          closed down all the areas of the vessel that we did not need.She instructed the armoury to fabricate more weapons and vast          amounts of ammunition and energy stocks, and to expand and enhance the hull.She fortified our force shields.She created          more robots to service the ship, to replace those destroyed in the battle.She turned herself from an Explorer vessel into          a dedicated fighting machine.I contributed little to all this, except strength and focus of emotion.For in this one respect only, Explorer was wrong.My mind may be weak, true; but my resolve is not feeble.So yes, Explorer is the mind and the body of our new warrior self;          but I am the passion that keeps us on our course.I am the flame that lights the wood that burns the forest.I am a creature          beyond Olaran now; an immortal essence.For I am become Hate; a Hate that, until it is sated, can never die.Our journey began in that first universe.We dwelled there for a hundred years, cruising from planet to planet, in search          of the Death Ship.And we did not find it.A futile fruitless search.It is hard to convey how truly painful was that utter bathos.To go from a white heat of rage toordinariness.It was not          tragic; it was merely banal.However, while in this new universe Explorer and I studied planets, catalogued civilisations from afar, and we even made direct          contact with one such species of sentients.For we encountered an exploratory space ship crewed with bipeds who found us altogether          most exotic and strange; a man machine with a scorched hull and a crazy passion to pursue an evil black sailed ship!I became fond of these bipeds; they were curious, witty, and intriguing.And, if I hadnt been so very insane, I would love          to have joined their fleet, to spend my days once more seeking out new civilisations.For though trading was once my passion,          I had come to care more about discovery, and about life in all its many forms.Explorer had calculated for me the odds of us finding the Death Ship in one of these          many (but we could not know how many, or indeed if there was any limit to them) universes; they were not good odds.Even if there were less than an infinite number of such universesthe chance of stumbling upon the one, the very same one, as the Death Ship          occupied, were almost laughably small.So Explorer asked me if wanted to give up our pursuit.I was, after all, still Master of the Ship.I could, in theory, abort          her programming.But I refused.We would not falter in our purpose, even though our failure seemed inevitable.And so we travelled on; and the curious bipeds went about their business.They were of a species called Cruxes.I felt they          had potential.And then the stars in our universe began to go out.Once we realised what was happening, ours was a desperate scramble to return to the area of space from which we had entered          this reality.We rifted ceaselessly; hurtling through un space with a reckless disregard for the agonies of improbability.As parts of us died and were mangled, Explorer replaced them with identical components.A human crew would have been killed          outright.By the time we had returned to our starting place, the Universe was nearly dead.And so we sought the same gap in space we          had found before; and we rifted; we entered a new reality, with moments to spare.Explorer had by then added twenty sentient species from this universe to our extensive Olaran archive of civilisations.And, once we entered our new universe, bitterly lamenting the death of the reality we had just fled, Explorer created a new          file category; the Log of Lost Civilisations.There were twenty one of them so far, including our own.We have been pursuing the Death Ship ever since.Sharrock I stood in the grass amphitheatre surrounded by a baying, howling mob.The arboreals led by Mangan were throwing rocks at me.Fray was roaring with rage, scratching the ground with her front hooves.The Quipus were assailing me with deadly five fold sarcasm, screaming at the top of all their voices.And I was damp from          the envenomed spittle spat by the serpentines, which made the bare flesh of my legs and arms and face sting.Then I sensed someone arriving behind me; and from her stench, and the characteristic sound of her tentacle loping gait, I          realised it was Sai ias.Back after all these many cycles.But I did not turn around.Instead, I carried on with my angry tirade, carefully making eye contact with my adversaries, and          ignoring the many intemperate and vicious heckles; even those relating to the sexual morality of my beloved wife.this day is an opportunity for I tried to say.fucking turd brain arse kisser raged Mangan.a chance for us, to discuss I persevered.no point, no fucking point, you fucking no brained imbecile That was Quipu Five or Four, I could never tell them apart.issues, scientific matters, or My words were drowned out utterly by screams and shouts and words of abuse.Whats the father fucking point!Djamrock had the right philosophical concepts, stop it all of you, listen I persisted.The Rhythm of Days, I shit upon the Rhythm of Days!to me, I implore you to masturbatory self deluding biped fool coward time waster lick cock!Lick cock!Lick cock!Lick A stone hit me on the temple.I tottered at the blow, which fractured my skull and blinded me in one of my eyes.Then I ducked          to the ground, and came up holding the stone.This stone, I said.Look at it!Shit balls were hurled at me by the arboreals; some splashed messily upon my body, others, the tight compacted balls, broke          my bones agonisingly.But this time I didnt even bother to dodge.I was drenched in brown excrement, my ribs had doubled          in number, and blood was streaming down my face.Why bother, Sharrock?said Fray, with just a hint of sympathy.Even the old bitch herself doesnt care!Look.Shes back          now!But she fucked away just when we needed her!And now I turned, and looked at Sai ias, and saw in her ghastly but (to my one eye) strangely beautiful features how distressed          she was; and wondered what had caused her such pain.And then I turned my gaze back to Fray.Speak with respect of Sai ias, I said quietly; and Fray was silenced.As a result of my rebuke to Fray, the clamour of the mob too was dimmed, so that I could at least hear my own voice and recognise          it as mine.Sharrock, what are you doing here?asked Sai ias; and her voice was weary.I am merely, I said, asking a question.And I turned in a slow circle, making single eye contact with as many of the malignly ignorant fucking aliens around me as          I could.And then I attempted to give the finest and most rousing and most inspiring battle speech of all my life!Except that this speech was not about battle at all.This stone, I said quietly, dropping it to the ground.Let us ask ourselves; why does it fall?At that moment, a total silence descended; a silence born, I feared, of bafflement.For who in all fuckery cared about why          stones fall?In my civilisation, I persevered, we have downwardness, as the principle that explains why objects fall, and how planets          remain in their orbits.Downwardness is the consequence of distortions in the cloth that comprises space and time.And so          it must be on this ship!Our world is on the inside not the outside of the globe, but downwardness still pertains!The silence changed, if such a thing be possible, in timbre; it was an angry and resentful silence now.But, as I had suspected, if you say something idiotically wrong in front of a bunch of incredibly brilliant scientific minds,          therell always be someone to pipe up and contradict you.And thus it was that one of the Quipus spoke:        That is nonsense!Its a different phenomenon entirely!said Quipu One, angrily.Were on the interior of a spaceship travelling          through space; not on a planet orbiting a sun.This illusion of downwardness as you call it must be what we call Madlora          force.I turned to him with a smile.Ah, I said, perhaps that corresponds with what we Maxolu call whirling force.Most likely, said Quipu One, huffily.That makes more sense!I said.A timely correction, Quipu.But how much force?How fast must our vessel rotate to create          this illusion of downwardness?Quipu shuffled, and his five heads bobbed in disharmony, a clear sign that he was in a state of inner turmoil.All this has been calculated, said Quipu One.The figures are recorded in my brain, said Quipu Two.Since we have no paper!grumbled Quipu Three.We have plenty of paper, but you stubborn four heads keep wasting it on blasted books of fantasy that no one ever reads!grumbled Quipu Four.The walls of my cabin contain the equations which describe our world in its dimensions, velocity, constitution and overall          mass, contributed Lardoi, a small brown ground hugging creature with twin snouts and fingers that could write like pens.All this has already been done, you fool, Sharrock!raged Quipu Five.In a hundred years on this world, said Lardoi, I have considered and solved every scientific question that can be posed          about our situation; your words are belated, and futile.Teach me what you know then, I said.Why?asked Lardoi scornfully.Because, I said, I may have spotted something that you missed.Lardoi literally hopped with rage at my words.I stifled a smile.That is not even remotely credible!said Mangan with contempt.Mangan was a mathematician of rare genius, so I had been          told, to my considerable surprise.You are just an ignorant warrior!Mangan continued.On this ship you will find the greatest          minds in existence, and we have applied ourselves to all these topics with no possibility of error.Yes, but have you unified the scientific theories of all the different species?I asked.We have, said Lardoi, proudly.Have you created a single mathematical system that encompasses all those different paradigms?We have, said Quipu One.Have you discovered the secret of the translating air?I asked, and Quipus head trembled with annoyance.We have not, conceded Quipu One.Then there is much to do, I concluded crisply.It is an impossible question to solve!Lardoi protested.We have no evidence.No theory can explain Then lets find a        Its a waste of time, snorted Lardoi.The only sensible approach is to All spoke at once; the words overlapped and became a cacophony in my ears.Mangan berated Lardoi for her stupidity; Quipus          heads contradicted each other.Then other voices joined in; ten, twenty, thirty, forty of them; then a hundred and more.All          the intellects of this interior world joined in an angry debate, wrestling with problems, complaining about the absence of          data, and mocking the inadequate and pin brained extrapolations of others!And thus the angry mob that had been pelting me with stones and shit had become a scientific forum.The lost and angry creatures          of this ship had been united, once again, in a common purpose: the exploration of knowledge, the pooling of insights, the          posing and testing of hypothesis and theories.And I turned to see Sai ias watching me.And I saw her gaze soften, as she realised what I had just done.For I had reinstated the Rhythm of Days.I had turned Day the Last into what it always used to be; a chance for minds to engage          with other minds in the solving of the darkest, deepest mysteries of the multiverses.In Sai iass absence, her world had turned to anarchy.But now, order had been restored.And, eventually, as the babble continued, I walked across to Sai ias, and stroked the soft skin of her face with my hand.The old Sharrock was gone.Today I was a shit stained, blood smeared orator who carried no weapons, other than his wits; and          fought no battles, save the battle against sloth, bitterness, and Despair.Sharrock, Sai ias acknowledged.Sai ias, I said to her, warmly, welcome back.Hell Ship           Sai ias Sharrock was naked, his body marked with scars and muscle ridges; and he walked out into the lake and dived under the water.With a sigh from my tentacle tips, I slithered out to join him.Ah!The touch of water on my soft skin was sublime.I swam deep out into the lake, still underwater; and Sharrock clung on          to me by my side flaps.I surfaced, and he took deep breaths, and clambered up my body and stood upon my head Then he looked across at the Tower;          his naked body gleaming with moisture, cleansed now of all the shit and blood.I wrapped a tentacle around his body gently and lifted him higher in the air; then began swinging him around in a circle.This is how, he gasped, the whirling force creates Please, you make my head hurt.Does this give you pleasure?I swung him round and round in the air and he screamed and screamed as if in pain but I knew it was not pain.Finally I stopped          and put him back on my head.That was, he gasped, so fucking And he stood up tall and roared with pleasure, wonderful!I laughed, and savoured his joy; his sensuality; his sheer delight at being alive.Sharrock was not of course aware I could do this; for I was eating his joy.Just as I had done with Cuzco during our act of sex.It is an ability my kind possess; intense empathy, verging on emotional telepathy.And thus, I could feel what it was to be, at this moment in time, a biped with hairless skin, alive to every taste and touch          of the exterior world, naked and damp and with a pulse that raced and pounded!I would not, I decided, ever tell Sharrock about my sensual ecstasy this day.It would, I suspected, constitute a violation          of his privacy that would affront him.And so I could never tell him that I had, vicariously, for these few exhilarating moments,          experienced what it was like to be        Sharrock.That night we slept, all of us who dwelled upon the Hell Ship, a long and dreamless sleep.And when I awoke, fear consumed me; for I knew what must have occurred during the first nights sleep I had experienced in          nearly half a century.Another Kaun apocalypse.I carried Sharrock on my back to the Valley of the Kindred, and there we counted the Kindred warriors who were remaining.Fifty had been lost in our long nightwhich spanned weeks or even months of actual time.Twelve of the giant sentients were          also missing.The grasses of the Great Plain had grown, the snows had melted on the mountain tops.Time had passed, but we          knew not how much.And warriors had been killed in battles, but we knew not in which battles, or how long it would be before          they were returned to us, rejuvenated.And then, to my dismay, I discovered there was a new one awaiting me in the confining cell in the corridor below my cabin.Welcome, I said to the creature, a white hided beast which squatted on all fours and had heads at each end.You bastard!You fucking bastard!screamed the beast.I will kill you and rape all your kin!Sharrock was with me, at his own request; he wished to learn how this was done.We are not your enemies, said Sharrock patiently, we are The white hided beast charged him, and I grabbed it with my tentacle and held it aloft.Sharp blades emerged from the two          mouths of the head that faced us; deadly and triple pronged.We are your friends!insisted Sharrock, but there was a quaver in his voice.I will kill you, all of you, all of you, whimpered the beast which was, I realised, quite mad.What can be done?asked Sharrock.The Kindred will hurl the body from the hull hatch.Nothing can be done, I said.Sharrock paused, and swallowed.We cannot allow that, he protested.Really?Then you should stop it, I suggested sweetly.ButI cannot!argued Sharrock, I cant fight the entire Kindred!There are still nearly a thousand of them remaining.It          would be        Then you must allow it; the beast has to die.You could do something.You could stop them.You could save        Save this mad gibbering beast?What would be achieved?Nothing, Sharrock admitted.Then nothing is what we can do.Sharrock thought about my words.So be it, said Sharrock.The beast was gone; the cell was empty.I looked at the uninhabited room and wondered what kind of creature it had been, before          grief had ripped away its sanity.Our world recovered; we never learned any more of the apocalypse in which our warriors had played a role.Sharrock asked me once about it; about what might have happened in the battles on the world of the four legged two headed          sentient, and how the Kaun had prevailed.I had no answer to give.We did not know.We simply did not know.So to speculate was futile.And so time passed, as time always does.We grew no older, no younger, no wiser.We merely were.Sharrock became my constant companion over the following many cycles; and a joyful time it was, often and for prolonged periods,          insofar as joyful could exist in our world.We took part in the Day of Races; with Sharrock sprinting against the grazers and the pack predators and winning.However,          he also rashly challenged Quipu to a test of mathematical acumen and lost, shamingly.Then he fought with sticks against Mangan          and all the other arboreals; and won, triumphantly, without anyone sustaining any serious injuries.Sharrock debated science avidly each Day the Last; and I could tell he was humbled at the intellectual greatness to be found          on the ship.And I showed him too the lower decks where Quipu had supervised the building of forges and electrical generators,          using minerals and cannibalised hull metal and reconstituted doors complete with electronic locks and hydraulics.With these limited means at his disposal, Quipu had built electrical lights, torches, sound recording devices and books made          up out of the barks of tree branches pulped and shaped and dried.And in these books, using ink taken from the blood of sea          creatures and sessiles, Quipus One, Two, Three and Five had transcribed many of the great works of fiction of our varied species.Any sentient being who loved to read could peruse these tales of strange worlds and fantastical creatures.The Quipus wrote          down their own tales about a variety of one headed monsters; Cuzcos civilisation had myths about peace loving philosopher          kings; my own people wrote novels about creatures that burrow deep under the earth, for this is a thing we ourselves never          did.Thus for a whilea long joyous while!Sharrock was content.Then that familiar impatience settled upon him.And I began to fear the worst.For Sharrock was starting to brood and fester andworst of allhope.And my fear was that he would drive himself to the brink and beyond of madness.Or even, as had happened to Cuzco, into the          pit of Despair.Why, Sharrock asked me, the Tower?His face bore the curiosity expression that I found so charming, and yet so worry inducing.It is a symbol set to taunt us, I said patiently.Fair answer.But why so visible?They could make their home in a mountain, and we would never know.That wouldnt be sufficiently taunting.True, true.Except Sharrocks mind was racing again.We could be happy now, I pointed out.We dont need to fight, or worry, or scheme.We could simply accept our lot, and          lives our days in peace and relative contentment.A fine philosophy, Sharrock conceded.But?But that is not a satisfactory way to live, for one such as I, Sharrock admitted, almost sheepishly.Sharrock was already remarkably fit and strong, at least by biped standards; but every day from that moment on he swam in          the lake for twelve hours or more.He slept; he swam; he consumed gloop and drank the water of life.He did nothing else.He was clearly building up his strength          for his next great adventure; but he would tell me nothing of his plans.I have to admit that I missed Sharrock during this period.I missed his companionship, his wit, his unexpected shafts of humour,          his sensual love of life that leached the pleasure from every moment, and his excessive energy that made all the other creatures          on the ship seem like sun basking idlers.Sharrock annoyed me constantly and deeply, but he invigorated me also.But as the Rhythm of Days continued in its usual steady and pleasingly predictable way, Sharrock spent all his time swimming,          until his body was puckered and white and his shoulders and arms and legs were even more disproportionately large than before.I knew of course what was going to happen next; it was hardly a challenge to my acumen to guess what Sharrock had in mind.Day the Fourth: a terrible storm raged, and most of the creatures on the ship huddled in their cabins.I however stood by          the side of the lake, drenched and buffeted, staring out across the water.The storm continued for three days and three nights and then ceased.And, several hours after the rains stopped, Lirilla appeared in front of me as I was attempting to bask in sunlight, feeling          my moist black skin drying up in the suns steady heat.Her wings beat against my face, and I blinked her into focus.Come, said Lirilla, What is it, sweet bird?I said, grumpily.Sharrock, Lirilla said.It was the news I had been expecting.Even so, dread consumed me.How is he?I asked.Dead, Lirilla trilled.My soul lurched, and I got up and followed the bird; flinging myself through air as fast as I could until I reached the lake.The fish had found Sharrocks body in the lake, and had summoned the arboreals, who had dragged him to shore.His flesh was          puffy, and he was covered in blood.He wasnt breathing.He had been dead, the arboreals told me, for about twelve hours.How did it happen?I asked, though I already knew.He tried, said Mangan, to swim to the Tower.Oh Sharrock!I raged inwardly.How could you do this to me!I cannot lose you, not so soon after losing Cuzco!And indeed,          not at all.But I showed no trace of my turbulent emotions; for no one on this world expected me to have any such intense and tragic feelings;          and I preferred it so.Ill stay with him, I said, calmly.After five days of lying fully immersed in a brook fed by the well of the water of life, Sharrock came back to life.His eyes flickered and he coughed.I sprayed him with spirit calming moisture from my tentacle tips, and forced well water          along a tube into his mouth.It would take a while for his broken bones to mend, but his skin was already back to normal and          there were no signs of major brain damage.I hated the black nights on the interior planet but I was determined to stay with Sharrock until he was fully revived.I could          imagine his fear at waking in the darkness and being alone.Even though he was still unconscious most of the time, I began to talk to him.I told him my innermost thoughts and fears.I told him of my love for Cuzco, and our single night of passion that had led to his stony death.I told him my fantasies          of achieving liberation and of finding true love again; though I knew that such dreams could never come true.No one else had heard these words from me; and Sharrock was too groggy to understand.But I needed to tell someone.Sai ias.His voice was a croak, but it filled me with relief.Im here, I said.I dribbled moisture on his lips.He breathed slowly, and forced himself to talk: I reached it, Sai ias!he told me.I reached the Tower.I know.I He coughed and spluttered.You stayed too long there; the longer you stay, the worse the storms, I said, rather primly perhaps.He took deep breaths.Gathering his energies.I know.But Sai iasI swam it!I swam around the entire island, touching the force shield at every point.If there had been          a crack, a gapI would have perceived it.I would have known.And I could see the Tower!And the pebbly beach.And the tides.Sleep, Sharrock.You have a long way to go before you are well.The tides, Sai ias, do you hear me?The tides.That day I carried Sharrock on my back to the well of life, so that he could drink its waters directly.I tipped a pail of          water over his head and saw his skin start to regain its dark scarlet colour.I sucked the water in through my own tentacle          tips and felt my own energy grow.The water was, I knew, haunted by the spirit of the Kaun; but it was also possessed of a truly magical power.It was the          power of revival; water from the lake or from the rivers was merely water.This water however had the power to heal, and could          even hold Despair at bay.The sun, said Sharrock.Too bright?Warm, said Sharrock.Its good.Sharrock stood up totteringly, and eventually got his balance.Then he practised walking on his weak but now unbroken legs.It was clumsy, like a barrel turning corners, but he didnt fall          once.You did well, I conceded, to swim to shore, through waters so angrily turbulent.Even though it took you several days.Sharrock made the sound that I knew to be his laugh.Once, he bragged, a warrior of my tribe swam the entire Halian Sea.And then, once he reached the other side, he slew a          dozen warriors of the Southern Tribe.I made a tinkling noise which I used with many bipeds to indicate my laugh.(In reality, for most species my laughter is of too low a tone to hear. )Then I stopped laughing, abruptly, and said: Why?Sharrock was disconcerted by the question.There was a war, he explained.It was a noble cause.The warriors of the South had failed to pay fealty to our empire.War was inevitable.But was anything achieved?Much glory was got, he said feebly.The only glory is in love, I told him, softly.Not so!Sharrock retorted.You fool!You blood thirsty savage!I raged.Sharrocks face was bright scarlet now with emotion.You are a fool, your people were fools, I have no patience with you any longer, I continued, unable to stem my flow of fury.Maybe, said Sharrock softly, you are right.But Sai iasthe tides!I saw the tides.Over the days that followed, I nursed Sharrock.I brought him food, I bathed his body with healing waters.And I made him          walk to strengthen his legs.I would slither along behind him, ready to prop him up with my tentacles if need be.But he resisted          all assistance, and wobbled and waddled along the path that leads beside the well of the waters of life; the path that I had          designed and which Quipu had built out of small jewelled stones hewn from the mountains.And as his strength grew, we talked.Perhaps there is, Sharrock said to me, glory in love.But theres no love here, on this weeping tears of blood fucking          ship.We are prisoners, and we have to kill our gaolers and escape.Impossible, I explained, but he persisted in his folly.Listen to me!You said there would be storms.And yes, there were indeed storms.You said I would not be able to reach the          Tower.And you were right, I could not reach the Tower.There is an invisible shell surrounding it.So I am entirely right, and you are entirely wrong?I summarised.Hear me out!Its more complicated.Sharrock paused.He was out of breath.I expanded a tentacle until it became a chair          for him to perch on.He sat on my limb.I listened, attentively, to his words.Heres the strange stuff.When I first touched the invisible shell, there were no storms.A touch of rain; no clouds; no          more.But the longer I stayed, the worse the weather got.And I could hear it.Hear what?A high pitched whine.Like a nocturnal animals echoing cry.Or, more accurately, like a proximity detector.We used them          to guard our buildings; its a simple electronic safety device.No magic.There was an urgency to his tone; a certainty that commanded my rapt attention.And I was so close, I could see the Tower clearly, Sharrock continued.It is made of silver brick; and is indeed a beautiful          creation, tall and vast, yet seemingly gracefully slender, its oval windows filled with coloured glass.We have buildings          in our cities of this shape, but this was more beautiful than anything I had ever seen.As he spoke, I could picture the scene.Sharrock had the gift of storytelling, the ability to make you feel that you were          there.Above me, he said, flew the aerials but none of them could fly close to the Tower, as you know.But then I looked at the          pebbly beach, and I saw the waves sweep over the pebbles.And I waited, treading water, for half a cycle until the tide had          gone out and the full reach of pebbles was revealed.And finally Sharrock reached his point: The lake has tides!Its an artificial effect, I assume the Dreaded are fond of waves.But the fact that the tide can go out on this pebbly island beach meansit means there must be a gap.An underwater path or route from the islands shore to the main body of the lake.Theres a hole in the force projection          field, in other words, below the water line.And once I had realised this, I dived down.And down, and down, clinging on to the soft force projection field with my finger          tips until I touched air.And then I swam under, through the gap, and into the water on the other side of the invisible barrier, and on to the beach itself.And I reached the other side, Sai ias.I was this close to the Tower!And then I heard a sound again.Another proximity detector; and thats when the real storms began.A wind started up; a wind          that whipped my face, and made me stagger as I walked.Then I saw a giant approach.Ten times my height and made of metal, stomping towards the beach.I had no chance of defeating          him, so I dived down into the water again, and swam back under the force projection field.And then I was in the midst of the storm; and the winds broke my bones and the water drowned me.And when I woke, I saw your          face glaring down at me.Never have I been so glad to see such a forsook by all the deities ugly fucking face as yours, Sai ias.But there are tides, Sai ias.And there is a way in.We can reach the Tower, Sai ias.We can do it!I was stunned by Sharrocks words, and for the first time in many aeons, I did not know what to do.Should I convey this information to the others?Or keep it as a secret?Sharrock had, I knew, been foolish in telling me so much.For the air that translates and that brings the light can also hear          our every word.The Kaun are like gods; they know everything that happens, and everything that is said.Which means they          already knew of Sharrocks venture into the Tower; and they knew too what he had just told me.We were both in deadly peril.Sharrock          was an idiot if he didnt realise this!And I thought about the prospect of death in Despair and I realised I feared it.My life was bleak enough; but the alternative          was far worse.For if the Kaun caught me, and declared me to be a rebel and a trouble maker, then they would punish me in          the most terrible of ways.
