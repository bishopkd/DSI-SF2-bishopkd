There was an oval table in the rear end of the machine: An oval shape which was also cut with an ingenious cavity, for aesthetic value.Mandal sat down at the table and drank an energy drink.He looked alternately through the rear window, sometimes on the gun by his side.The scenario that he saw was painted in colorful shades: The intruder who was shot, the intruder who fell, the bandage that was wrapped around his own wounds.The truth that was revealed later: The image of himself in the global ether.He was getting ready for the attack.He sat down in the link chair.The robot was activated.It went down the stairs, across the grass and up to the entrance of the machine.The door opened and the shape stood still in the opening, as a living hero, illuminated by the light of dawn: Mandal came to his senses.The robot retrieved the weapons.* * *      The morning passed slowly until morning.Mandals second I walked effortlessly over the arched landscape.He passed the place where the first discovery had surprised him earlier.Mandal saw something and was astounded.There, in the same place as before, plants sprouted from the earth.These plants resembled nothing hed previously seen: It was a kind of bushes, full grown in a very delicious, yet scary way.There were bushes taken from a futuristic tale: Blade, oblong and sinister, blood red with dark veining.There were flowers in violet, delicate, beautiful, but with an excrescence resembling a scorpion.Tucked away in the bushes, you could see something that looked like a dragon: An outgrowth, full of nutrition and vitality, a flower in full that sprayed flames of fire.Mandal was amazed, excited and surprised.The intruder was beyond mysterious: A man standing outside time and space, making small adjustments whenever he wanted, changing everything for the better?He activated a camera and photographed the flower.Then he walked the mile long route back to the working machine, went up the ladder and stood corrected.Mandal broke the connection and returned to the interior of the machine.He stood up and walked down to the workroom.He was met by the green plants; experiments not yet finished.He was about to improve parts of the garden: Infuse life into dead batches, bringing the unknown into boring sections.But now he was very fascinated.He sat down at the desk, where there was a computer and a large two dimensional screen.He downloaded the photograph from the robot and enlarged it on the screen.It was a transformative experience of something new: A biological version of the Chinese dragon.This was not harmless in its luster: It had scales and horns, streaks of color along its coiled body.And then the fire.Mandal returned to the link chair and connected to the robot.He walked along the flowering trails, hastily, to the dwelling house.When he arrived at the scene, he saw that the same thing had happened at the garden plot: A kind of flowers had sprung out of the earth.They had green stems, separated by a sort of whirling moss.The moss was growing halfway up the stems and gave force to the flowers.The shapes of the petals had the semblance of black insects: Beetles from a time after the death of nature: Experiments from a gene manipulated future, where everything was possible.Mandal photographed the flowers and returned to Nimrod 3.Suddenly there was the sound of a huge explosion: Tremors of a force Mandal had never experienced.Noise.A feeling that the foundations of reality was breaking up.Mandal ran to the link chair, hooked up against the robot and ran across the lawn.It rumbled by a quake from the interior of the mini planet.And then the impossible happened:  Suddenly, like a colossal absurdity, the shards of the mini planet began to separate.At first it happened in the middle, where the northern hemisphere met the southern hemisphere.Later these halves were separated into their smaller shards, as if a giant knife had emerged in space and cut them into pieces.Explosion was heard after explosion.Aquatica began to rotate: Like a breakdown of the laws of the cosmos, totally unnatural but still true.Mandal was struck with horror.The gravity was still intact, but it began to drop.You could see the water from the lakes flush over the countryside.It floated around the bushes, over the hills and disappeared over the edges.The robot stood unsteadily on the ground.Then the intruder came.He hovered in the air like a cursed spirit.In his hand was a weapon similar to Mandals.Green rays cut through the air.The robot blocked.The unit on the enemys back proved to be a jet propulsion.The shard of the planet rotated and day became night.Lights came on and the robot retreated to the protection of Nimrod 3.There was a stillness in the air, the feeling before a storm: A noise could be heard that wasnt there: Delusions from a young mind that had never seen God.Mandal took up the exploder and searched for a way to destroy the enemy.Suddenly the enemy was seen again.He hovered above Nimrod 3, fired his ray gun and hit the robot.The robot fell backwards and was injured at the moment of contact.Mandal fought with maximum strength in order to maintain sharpness.The robot's arm came loose, but it rose from the ground and picked up the gun again.The enemy attacked.He fired his ray gun.The robot was hit, dropped the exploder and had to seek shelter in the working machine.The robot was moving gently across the floor, stopped and collapsed on the same point.Mandal rose from the link chair.Suddenly, a window exploded on the left side of Nimrod 3.The enemy came into the space.Mandal threw himself on the floor, dead cold of failing thermostats, snatched hold of the exploder and fired the plasma charge.Nothing happened.The enemy looked at Mandal, Mandal looked back.The intruder resembled nothing Mandal had ever seen: It was no man.It was a mix between a machine and an alien.One leg was perfectly cast in metal.Organic fragments in beige were up against the central area.There were ribbed beams in aluminum, a kind of skeleton.But pristine skin grew from the stomach area and up to the scapula.There they sat, conspicuous tubes, which were coupled with the jet pack on his back.His face was encased in a helmet, leaning forward.It was terrifying but very beautiful.
