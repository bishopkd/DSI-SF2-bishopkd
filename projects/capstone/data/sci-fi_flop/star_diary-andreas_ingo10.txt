The soldier with the radio asked the other soldiers to lower their weapons.Things had changed.They had orders to return home.Simone watched Christopher.He didnt look like a normal human being.It was the silhouette of a hero.Someone who tried something no one dared: Someone who failed but didnt bother.His form began to change.The alien came back again.The scales on the back were looking upwards.Muscular contractions appeared around the jaw.One of the soldiers raised his weapon and pulled the trigger.Die you bastard!he screamed.Christopher fell to the floor.Simone saw the over man go through the transformation: The young man became an alien or something else no one could understand.The soldiers stood in a circle and watched the entity that bled on the floor.Simone descended over Christopher in horror: Inexplicably in love with this man for no reason.Well leave you to your destiny.The soldier said, As a reward for doing nothing.The soldiers took off and left the alien on the floor.Nobody cared about Harold or Simone.The desperate screamed from the other room.Simone emphatically stroked her hand along the outgrowths on Christophers head.The alien became a man again.Uncontrolled movements could be observed along Christophers body.Tears formed in Simones eyes and fell down on Christophers cheeks.Dark eyes with a burning flame of zeal: An eagerness to live and accomplish something.Everything will be better now.Christopher said, I wasnt dying.Far from it!I just wanted to test your loyalty, see your benevolence.The wounds healed miraculously and Christopher sat up.Simone kissed the man who had saved her from boredom and shown her a better life.* * *      The days thereafter were spent looking at the place where the giant spaceships had been assembled.But now new orders came on the saucers disassembly.The couple watched the demolition work and felt new hope in their hearts.They returned to the space station where Christopher told Simone about the time to come.Ive been informed that the aliens are approaching.It should be a peaceful meeting between civilizations.I dont know how they look.Perhaps similar to me.Perhaps similar to something else no one can imagine.The couple spent days in Christophers bedroom.He showed drawings that he made, which demonstrated the engineering he used in the attempts to transform himself.He was proud of his achievements.He had never felt like a normal human being.He had taken the job on the space station as a border guard, just to get closer to people like him: People who didnt belong in space or on Earth.Just at the border between territories, between earth and eternity.Simone joined Christopher in the act of love.They groped in the darkness for the unreachable; the place where man and woman met and everything was new.* * *      The following day giant ghosts hovered in the sky and overshadowed the human colonies.It was anachronistic ships, shaded in different batches.A language that was written in eternity, who told stories no one, had heard.Creatures entered through the gates and joined with the pair on the floor.The creatures reminded not at all about the forms Christopher had created.These were black and they were a kind of collective soul, connected to each other through different fibers.It felt like a mixture between the animal world and the plant kingdom.The creatures viewed Christopher in silence.It was a strange recognition, but not yet a sense of association.Someone raised a gun and fired a plasma charge.Christopher fell to the floor and tried to get up.Simone screamed in panic and stood in the way of the aliens.A creature pushed her aside and put an end to the man who crawled on the floor.Simone couldnt believe her eyes.Feelings welled up again.But the creatures let her be, took place in their monstrous ships and abandoned the couple.They let streaks of fire consume the connections to the space station.Simone looked out and saw the space elevator go up in smoke.The whole setup began to rotate.It felt like the foundations of reality was breaking up.But she couldnt believe in death.Not in Christophers death.Not now.The artificial gravity gave way.The air was sucked out.She felt the air pressure change.She saw the huge explosions on the earths surface.This was no accident.Christophers story was a false story.He wasnt a man who lied.The telepathic messages had been fraudulent in nature: This in order to undermine the human defenses and destroy humanity on her way out in space.Simone didnt care.As far as she knew Christopher was a hero.She was a girl who finally had grown up: Who found her match in her opposite: That left psychoanalysis behind just to reach into the unknown.And now she floated weightlessly into outer space only to be discovered by a distant civilization.There were creatures that would come to her rescue: Survivors from a destroyed civilization, in search of like minded souls.She climbed their ships, carrying the body of the deceased.He was revived and the pair was immortalized in the journey toward the stars.And they just enjoyed.
