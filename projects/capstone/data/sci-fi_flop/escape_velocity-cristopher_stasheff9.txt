And it traces back to lack of knowledge, Dar said softly.Not all of it.Stroganoff frowned; then he nodded.But a lot of it.Yah.A lot.Ever hear of Charles T.  Barman?Dar said slowly.The rogue educator?Stroganoff grinned.Yeah, Ive heard of him.Read his main book, even.Yes, Ive followed his career with great interest.Great interest.Yes.He turned to Dar, his eye gleaming.They never caught him, you know.No, Dar said judiciously, they never did.Dar took a sip and frowned up at Lona over the rim of his glass.Whats he doing in there?Creating, Lona answered.For so long?Long?Lona smiled without mirth.Its only been six hours so far.It takes that long to do up one of thosewhatd Stroganoff call it ?Series format, Sam reminded him.Yeah, one of those.He finished that three hours ago.Lona took a sip.Stroganoff needs the script for the first program, too.But hes just talking into a voice writer!How can a one hour script take more than an hour?Its thinking time, not talking time.And dont forget, its got to be verse.Thats the only reason Stroganoff might be able to persuade OPI to do itbecause its a 3DT series of Tod Tambourins poetry.And poems take a great deal of work, Father Marco said softly.Actually, I dont see how he can possibly have a full hours worth of verse by 10:00 hours tomorrow.Oh, verse he can manage.Lona glanced at the closed bedroom door that hid Whitey.Poetry would take foreverbut he isnt worrying about quality.Verse he can grind out by the yard.What if inspiration should strike?Father Marco asked quietly.Then, Lona said grimly, we may be in here for a week.Oh, well.Dar got up and went over to the bar o mat for a refill.At least he gave us a nice waiting room.He looked around at the luxurious hotel suite living room.Come to think of it, I hope inspiration does strike    Dar had a vague memory of Father Marco shepherding them all to their bedrooms, muttering something about an early day tomorrow, but it was rather fuzzy; a tide of some nefarious mist reeking of Terran brew seemed to have rolled in as the light faded.He awoke with a foul taste in his mouth, a throbbing ache in his temples, and an acute sensitivity to noises.He dropped back against the pillow, but sleep refused to return.Finally he resigned himself to having to pocket the wages of sinthough the pocket in question was feeling rather queasy at the momentand slowly, very carefully, swung his feet over the side of the bed.He clutched his head and waited for the room to stop rolling, gulping air furiously to quiet his stomach.Eventually, it sort of worked, and he staggered to his feet.Then he had to lean against the wall, gasping like a beached fish, to wait until things stabilized again.It was a longer wait, but it worked, and finally he was able to stagger out into the sitting room.The light had been turned down to a dim glow from the ceiling, thank heavenbut there was a babble of voices.Strangely, they didnt make his head hurt any worseand, even more strangely, there was only one person in the room.That person was Whitey, sprawled in a recliner with a strange glow in his eyes.He noticed Dar, cocked his head to the side, and held out a tumbler full of a thick, brownish liquid.Dar groped for it, seized it, and drank it off in one long gulp.Then his eyes bulged as his stomach gave a single, tumultuous heave.He swallowed it down and exhaled in a blast.My lord!What is that stuff?Uncle Whiteys Homemade Hangover Helper, Whitey answered.Dont ask whats in it.I wont, Dar said fervently.He groped his way to a recliner and collapsed into it.Howd you know I was going to need it?I looked in on you halfway through the night.Whitey grinned.You were a gas.Dar frowned.A gas?Thoroughly tanked, Whitey explained.A hazy memory of Whitneys bleached face, peering down intently, floated through Dars mind.Oh, yeah.I remember something about it.He frowned, then forced a feeble chuckle.Yeah, you  no, it mustve been a dream.It wasnt.Whyd you think it was?Because you asked  and I told  Dar swallowed heavily.No.Had to be a dream.Asked what?Told me what?Wellmy mission.What Im supposed to do on Terra.No dream, Whitey assured him.And I timed it just right.In vino veritas.In wine there is truth?Dar stared, aghast.Whiteys eyelids drooped.You do know a little Latin!Amazing, in this day and age.Who managed to drum it through your head?My old boss, a bartender named Cholly.But   Hm.Must be an interesting man.Whiteys eyes were glowing again.Like to meet him sometime.You will, at the rate were going.You wont have any choice in the matter.Dar swallowed.Whatd I tell you?What do you remember?That I had a message from General Shacklar to the I. D. E.  top brassabout a plan for a coup  Whitey nodded.Perfect recall.Dar groaned and crumpled, covering his eyes.Whitey leaned forward and patted his shoulder.Dont take it so hard, laddiewe all make mistakes the first time out.At least, if you had to spill the beans, you did it to a friend.Friend?Dar glared up.How can I be sure, now?Because Ive spent a lot of money, and put myself in quite a bit of danger, just to help youand when I heard your story, I was glad I had.Not that I think we can succeed, mind youbut I cant let democracy go down without a fight.Somehow, Dar believed him.He frowned up at Whitey, against his headache.You mustve had a hunch I was doing something you believed in, thento put yourself and Lona at risk.Well, yes.Whitey settled back, picking up a glass.I did have a notion the gamble was worth it.Lonas another matter, though.I didnt make her come.She couldve stayed behind, with plenty of money, and she knew it.Dars brows pulled together.She doesnt strike me as the self sacrificing sort.She isnt.That line she feeds out, about wanting to wallow in luxury with plenty of leisure time to slaughter, is true down to the wordbut she knows there are more important things.Such as having one person nearby who really cares about hermeand freedom, without which she wouldnt have a chance at luxury.Dar looked around.Where is she?Whitey jerked his head toward the closed door.Proofing the script.Its done?Dars gaze steadied on Whiteys face.Any good?Whitey shrugged irritably.Does it matter?Itll get you where you need to go; thats the important thing.Suddenly, something seemed wrong.Dar lifted his head.What happened ?Oh.The voices stopped.Voices?The 3DT, you mean?Is that where they were coming from?Dar turned to the wall screen, and saw the word EMERGENCY!floating in a blue sea.A voice said, Indulgence, citizens.We have to interrupt to bring you news of a conspiracy against the whole of the Interstellar Dominion Electorates.The word dissolved into the head and shoulders of an earnest looking, handsome older man.Sehn Loffer here, with news directed from I. D. E.  Internal Security.We are threatened, fellow citizensthreatened by an insidious evil, creeping up on us everywhere, to choke the life out of our democracy and suck the blood of its freedom.Whitey muttered, Lousy prose!Dar stared at him, appalled.But hes the top newsface!Theyre hearing him all over the Solar Systemand FTL liners will take this recording cube to all the colonies within the month!Yeah.Nothing succeeds like excess.The villain may be your neighbor, your friend, your co worker, Loffer went on.No one can know where the evil ones lurkbecause, citizens, they are telepaths!Whitey stared Dar goggled.Insidious telepaths, their tendrils of thought snaking out to enfold your brains!All through the I. D. E.  they are.How do we know?Because, for a month now.Security has been chasing a notorious telepath all the way from the marches, the outermost colonies, here to Luna itself!Time and again, they have almost caught him, only to have him whisked away into hiding, by local assistance!The local assistance swore under his breath.Who would aid a rogue telepath?Loffer declaimed.Who but another telepath?Wherever this monster goes, he finds helpso there must be telepaths spread throughout the I. D. E. , helping him, working secretly, to undermine the foundations of our freedom and destroy our governmentto take power themselves!Uhdont I detect a few flaws in his logic?Dar asked.Logic?Whats that?Whitey snorted.It feels right, doesnt it?So its got to be truedoesnt it?But take heart, citizens!Suddenly, Loffer fairly oozed calm strength.Our noble Solar Patrol is pursuing this monster, and will not rest until they destroy him!What does right to fair trial mean?Whitey wondered.Smiling confidently, Loffer dissolved into a sea of plain blue, filling the screen.A voice said, We now return you to Starship Captains Wife.Whitey pressed the button in the arm of his recliner, and the picture faded into an assortment of fruits in a basket; the wall screen became only a three dimensional still picture again.UhI thought reporting was supposed to be objective, just telling you the facts theyre sure of, Dar said tentatively.Whitey gave him a peculiar look.No, you havent been to Terra before, have you?But  why?Dar exploded.Announcements like that are going to panic the public!Why get everybody into a state of terror about it?I have a notion, Whitey muttered, but I hope Im wrong.Its got to be because they want to make absolutely sure they catch me.But why?Am I that much of a threat to them?And howd they get the idea Im a telepath?Maybe they didnt.Telepath is a nice scare word, conjuring up somebody poking into your most private affairs, somebody having a huge, unnatural advantage that makes everybody else feel inferiorand, therefore, all the more willing to go out and help hunt him down.Useful, if they want to make sure they catch you.And as to your being a threat, wellthe answer is, you dont have to be much of a threat.Conspirators tend to not want to take chances, no matter how small.The LORDS party in the I. D. E.  Assembly want to restrict individual rights, and theyve never been so strong.Their opposition has fractured into a dozen splinter groups.If theres an opposition leader, its Tarn Urkavne, the chairman of the CPRthe Coalition for the Protection of Rights.At least hes officially the Opposition speaker.But his Coalition is pretty weakits members spend their time arguing over policy, instead of trying to do something.But the LORDS arent trying to overthrow the whole I. D. E.  government, are they?Whitey shrugged.If they are, theyre not sayingof course.Thats high treason, boy.No, you may be sure whoevers behind the coup are keeping their lips well sealed, and want to make sure everybody else does, too.The bedroom door opened.Well, enough of politics.Whitey craned around in his seat, looking back over his shoulder.Hi, honey.Lona swayed out into the sitting room, and the sight of her made Dar decide to stay among the living.He decided Whiteys hangover cure was working.But she had a kind of glassy look in her eyes, a sort of fevered brilliance.Was she ill?I told you, you shouldnt have stayed up waiting for me to finish, Whitey said, frowning.You get to bed, honey; you can still catch about three hours sleep before we have to leave.How can I, with this running through my head?Lona shoved a sheaf of papers at him.Whitey squared the sheets on his lap, smiling up at her, almost shyly.Liked it, huh?Lona nodded, with a tight smile; she looked as though she were about to explode.Whitey grinned and turned to Dar, holding out the sheaf.First hard copy.See what you think.Dar took the script and began to scan it.His eyes locked in after the third line, tracking the print at speech speed, words thundering in his head.Whitey, this is      wonderful!Father Marco breathed, looking up from the last page.Sam looked up from her copy with a numbed gaze and an awed nod.Rough, Whitey grumbled, flushed with pleasure.Needs polish.Lots of it.Its a masterpiece, Sam whispered.Whitey sat still a moment, then gave a brusque nod.Good.Yes.Rough, butits good.Thank you.Lona laid a gentle hand on his shoulder.9:30 hours, Grandpa.Yeah.Whitey heaved himself to his feet with a sigh.Time to go meet Stroganoff, childrenthe Knight of the Shining Laser, who will do battle with the Dragon of Commerce for us.Ready?Dar paced the lounge furiously, hands locked behind his back.Whats he doing in therereading them the whole script?Calm down, Da  uh.Perry.Whitey leaned back in his chair like a cat by a fire, a tall drink in his hand.It means its going well.If the execs didnt like his presentation, hedve been out half an hour ago.The door opened, and Stroganoff shuffled in, holding the script in front of him as though it were a tray, eyes glazed.Dar pounced on him.Well?Whats the word?They like it?They gonna buy it?What?Stroganoffs head swiveled toward him, but his gaze went right through Dar.Father Marco pried Dar away with a soothing murmur, and Whitey echoed him: Calm down, Perry.They wont finish deciding for a while yet  Howd it go, David?Stroganoffs head turned toward Whitey, but his eyes still didnt quite focus.Tod  why didnt you warn me?Warn?Whitey frowned.About what?About this!Stroganoff held the script out reverently.I gave em the overview, and the audience potential, the cost minimalization, and the company image enhancement, and they sat there looking bored, so I started reading them the first few lines, just to give em the ideaand I couldnt stop!I just kept going, right through the whole thingand they didnt cut me off!Not a word!They actually listened!Whitey grinned and sat back.Well.Nice to be appreciated.Appreciated!My lord, Tod, thats topping the Prize!Dar heaved a silent sigh.He might make it to Earth, after all.They were laughing and chattering as they came back into their hotel, riding high on a triumphuntil a grave faced major domo stepped up to Whitey and intoned, Mr.Tambourin, sir?The laughter cut off as though it had been sliced with a razor blade.Whitey turned to the man in livery, frowning.Yes?Theres a call waiting, from Mr.Horatio Bocello, sir.Hes been quite insistent in his demands that he speak with you.Whiteys face cracked into a cream whiskered grin.Old Horatio!Sam was staring, shocked.Father Marco blinked.Even Lona looked impressed.Dar looked around.Then they all jumped to catch up with Whitey.But the major domo was ahead of them.Ah, Mr.Tambourin?Whitey looked back.Yes?He really has been quite insistent, sir.The staff would very much appreciate it if you would take the call as soon as you arrive in your suite.Yeah.I know what Horatios like when he gets insistent.Whiteys grin was downright evil.Dont worry, my good manIll hit the phone as soon as Im upstairs.You can tell Terra the calls going through.His hand brushed the major domos as he turned away; the man glanced at his palm, and his eyebrows shot up.Thank you, sir.My pleasure.Come on, troops!Whitey was striding away toward the lift tube.His crew lurched into motion behind him.Whos Horatio Bocello?Dar hissed.Only the richest man on Terra, gnappie!Sam hissed back.Which means, in the whole system.Devout Catholic, too Father Marco said thoughtfully.Patron of the artsespecially Grandpas, Lona added.Dar swallowed heavily, and walked faster.When Whitey careened through the door, the com screen was already alive with white noise, its beeper beeping.Whitey pressed the answer button and thumbed the toggle that uncapped his camera.The screen cleared, showing a thin, long jawed, bony face with a receding iron gray hairline, a blade of a nose, and burning eyes.The eyes focussed on Whitey, and the face grinned.Tambourin, you old scalawag!Whereve you been?In a hundred bars on fifteen planets, Cello.Whitey grinned back at him.You want exact figures, youll have to tell me how long its been.Whatfive years, this time?Why dont you write, reprobate?Buy it from your book channel, windy.Hows your empire?Bocello shrugged, with a trace of annoyance.You win some, you lose some, and it keeps growing, all by itself.Whitey nodded.No change.It was a lot more fun back in the Northeast Kingdom.I know.Whitey smiled fondly, gazing back down the years.Running around in homemade armor, chopping at each other with rattan swords.And for the parties, dressing up like a fourteenth century duke.Except you, of course.You never could decide whether you wanted to be a knight or a troubadour.Dar nudged Lona, having a legitimate reason, and whispered, Whatre they talking about?A bag of mixed nuts, Lona whispered back.Some group they both belonged to when they were young.Used to go out to a park on weekends and pretend they were still living in the middle ages.Well, I finally did.Whiteys smile gentled.I swung to the troubadourand you finally accepted your birthright obligations, and turned into a baron.Yes, without the title.Bocellos face clouded.But its not as much fun, Tod.Youve got to lock into reality sometime, Cello.You keep tabs on the old Kingdom?Bocello nodded.Still.Im still a member.I sneak into the annual festival every now and then.You should, too.I do, when I run into a Kingdom.But there arent too many of em on the colony planets yet, Cello.Hold onto your sword, Your Graceyou may need it.Bocello was suddenly alert.You see the signs, too, eh?But I dont think therell be chaos, Tod.No, Whitey agreed, just the reverse.Its a dictator thats coming, not a warlord.Cant you do anything about it, Cello?You, with all your money!Bocello shook his head sadly.I always sneered at politics, Todand now its too late.He frowned, suddenly intent.Youre not planning to try to stop it, are you?To throw yourself in the path of a runaway destrier?Romanticisms for the young, Cello, Whitey said gently.No, I just got a modern idea, thats all.Yes, I heard.Bocellos face split into a mischievous grin.And I love it!Damn fine poem, Tod!Damn fine.Whitey scowled.Got eyes and ears everywhere, dont you?Tod!Bocello protested, wounded.I own OPIor fifty one percent of it, anyway.They knew it was too hot to handle, so they bucked it on up to me fastest!Youre going to decide whether or not my epic gets made?Dar held his breath.Bocello shrugged impatiently.What is there to decide?The way your last book sold, we couldnt possibly lose money on Tod Tambourins first screenplay!All I want to know is, how quickly can you do it?Whitey grinned.My crews ready to go tomorrow, Cello.Wonderful.But youll need a little while to cast the actors and have the sets designed and built.Yeah, but we can shoot the documentary sequences meanwhile.And, Cello  Whiteys voice lowered.if were going to have the I. D. E.  Assembly and the Executive Secretary in that one sequence, I think wed better shoot them fast.Yes, I know.Bocello sobered.The whole things built around the I. D. E.  He leaned forward, suddenly intense, eyes burning.Very fast, Todbefore the whole programs just an historical document!Dar fastened his webbing and looked around at the luxurious cavern of the shuttles passenger cabin.Little different from a burro boat, isnt it?You could put two of them inside here, Sam agreed.Maybe three.Dar swiveled his head to look at her, puzzled.Youve been awfully moody these past couple of hours.Whats the matter?Nothing.Sam shook her head with total conviction.Absolutely nothing is wrong.But she still gazed off into space.It was that call from Horatio Bocello that did it, isnt it?What was so bad about itdidnt realize the I. D. E.  was in this bad a shape?That is saddening, Sam agreed.But Im not saddened.Then what are you?Dazzled, she said frankly.Dar stared at her for a second.Then he smiled.Never saw anybody that rich talking just like an ordinary person, huh?Yeah, it kind of got to me, too.Not that, she objected.Well, maybe a little.But what got me was his face!Face?Dar stared again.She nodded.That forehead!That blade of a nose!Those cheekbones!And  those eyes!Dar turned his head a little to the side, watching her.Are you trying to tell me you thought he was handsome?Handsome.Thats a good word for it.Attractive is better.Maybe even  compelling.Dar began to have serious doubts.I thought you were supposed to be an ascetican anti materialist.She turned a gaze full of scorn on him.You take beauty wherever you find it, gnappie, and you keep the memory of it alive in your heart.Ill probably never even talk to this man and, when this whole escapade is over, never see him again, either.But Ill never forget that I did, and the memory of it will make the rest of my life that much richer.As they were crowding off the shuttle at Newark Interplanetary, Dar overheard some girl talk between Sam and Lona.Married?Never, Lona said firmly.Never even seen with a lady friend very often.Thats brought the usual run of snide comments, of course.About his masculinity?And his sexuality, period!He reinforces that one, tooclaims to be asexual.Says theres no point in sex unless youre in love.What a medieval romantic, Sam murmured dreamily.Somehow, Dar didnt think they were talking about Whitey.They strode down the concourse toward the main terminal, laughing and chattering.Dar felt heady, almost drunk.He was on Terra!The Terra of his history books, of Cicero and Caeser and the Plantagenets and Lincoln!The Terra of fable and wonder!He walked on a thick red carpet, surrounded by wall screens flashing displays of arrival and departure times between spates of advertisingjust the way hed pictured it from his books!Suddenly the wall screens cleared.A giant chime sounded, reverberating throughout the entire building.All around them, conversation slackened and died; all faces turned to the wall screens.Citizens, a resonant voice intoned, the Honorable Kasi Pohyola, Chairman of the LORDS, and Majority Leader in the Assembly of Electors of the Interstellar Dominions.A stern but gentle face appeared, surmounted by wavy, snow white hair, gazing directly at Dar.He almost jumped out of his skin.Citizens, the face intoned in a deep, resonant voice, a huge calamity has befallen us.An insidious danger stalks toward us across the starsnay, has stalked us, has arrived, is even now in our midst!It may be the person beside you, or behind youor even inside your head!For know, citizens, that there is no real guarding against this evil monstrosity, no wall that will seal it away, no shield that will stand against itfor it is a telepath!Even now, he may be probing your mind, wrapping his thoughts about your heart, cozening your innermost secrets!But worse, citizenshe is not alone!Our agents have shadowed him from the outermost colony planets, in to Terra herselfalways treading upon his shadow, but never able to pounce on the creaturefor always, just as they were about to close their trap, he has disappeared, spirited away by his friends and sympathizers on a thousand planets!Only ninety three, Whitey muttered, as of last years census report.Who could have assisted such a one?Pohyola rumbled.Who would give aid and solace to a being who could probe their innermost thoughtssave another telepath?That, citizens, is why we are sure there are many telepaths, spread throughout the Terran Sphere, on each and every one of its member planetsand including Terra herself!A horrified murmur and buzzing of oaths and curses spread through the concourse.It fairly made the hairs stand on Dars head.He glanced at his companionsthey were all watching with set, pale faces, lips drawn tight.Except Whitey.He just looked sad.Pohyola stared into the camera, not speaking, just holding the viewers gazes with his ownapparently hed been planning on the reaction.Just as it was quieting, he began to speak again.Our vaunted I. D. E.  Security Force has been impotent to stop themthese millions of highly trained warriors for whom we pay trillions of therms every year!Are they inept?No!Are they lazy or cowardly?No!They are brave, capable heroes, every one of them!Then, why have they not been able to seize this horror?Because, while he has been slipping into hiding, they have had to find a magistrate and present proof of need for a search warrant!Because they have had to waste time securing proof of his guilt in order to obtain that warrantthough they have known, all along, what he is!Because the courts will not allow these fine officers to monitor the communications between this monster and his minions!He glared down out of the screen in righteous wrath.They are impeded at every turn, they are balked at every approach!And, while the courts dither and obstruct them, the telepath moves unimpeded onto our fair mother planet!He shook his head slowly.Citizens, this has gone too far!This obsession with legal pettifoggery has now imperiled your lives and mine, nay, even the fabric of our whole society!Who now can feel free to nurture secret hopes or longings, to dream of his beloved or reflect on his sinsknowing that, every moment, anothers mind may have wormed its way into his, cozening up to his dearest, most cherished secrets!Nay!The time has come to put a stop to the nonsense!To purge the technicalities and loopholes that let the criminal escape while the law abiding citizen shuffles in chains!To exorcize the demons of law!Make no mistake, citizensa vast conspiracy of telepaths has wrapped its coils around us, and is even now beginning to squeeze the life from our democracy!Will they triumph?Nay!he thundered.We will tear their coils apart, we will rip them asunder!The law will cease obstructing the champions of justice!Then, suddenly, his eyes were locked onto Dars again, burning.But this cannot be done while Executive Secretary Louhi Kulervo dithers and vacillates!A man of decision must take the helm, a man of true strength, who does not waste expanses of time mewling about sacred trusts and constitutionality!He took a deep breath, very obviously fighting down wrath, struggling for composure, then said more calmly:  It is for these reasons, citizens, that I will, today, demand a vote of confidence in the Assembly, and a general election.We must succeed in forcing this referendum, my fellow citizensor we will waken one morning to find ourselves enmeshed in chains of thought!Contact your Elector, now, this minute, and tell him to demand an election.We must have it, citizenswe must have a man of decision and action to lead usor the light of democracy will flicker out, and die!The image on the screen flickered out, and died.A roar of conversation burst out all around them.Whitey glanced back at his adrenalized crew, looking a little nervous himself.Ah  I think we should just start drifting toward the main terminal  and try to look surprised, folks.That wasnt hard.Dar felt as though hed just been knocked spinning by a shockwave.It wasnt just that one fleeing little ship had been turned into a conspiracyor that the coup was leaping out into the open.It was the idea that they might even be able to do it legally!A very good chance, from what he was overhearing as they drifted:  I thought they only had a couple of telepaths in the whole sphere!an obese commercial type was saying.So did I, a slenderized companion answered, but I guess those were just the ones they knew aboutyou know, legal ones.They can really find out your most secret memories?This from an old harridan who obviously had one hell of a past, but didnt necessarily want it known.But  they could learn all my accounts, all the latest information Ive gleaned about which stocks are due to rise!The beefy, florid faced individual in the conservatively expensive coverall glared in righteous indignation.Thats a completely immoral competitive advantage!Have to be stopped, his companion agreed.Have to be.They could take over!a sweet young thing shrilled, and they might clamp down on the vice laws!Telepaths certainly wouldnt want people running around with their heads full of smut.Her companion had the look of a questionable publisher.I mean, what about civil rights?But what about civil rights?Snow white hair, face full of authority, oozing confidencemaybe a judge?Theyd be gone.His companion was younger, but cut from the same cloth.Make Pohyola Exec Secy, give him full emergency powersand the first thing hell do is suspend the constitution.Well have a full scale dictatorship in a year.Are you two going to natter about technicalities at a time like this?a slender, intense type bawled, turning on them.Do you realize what our chances of getting approval for a price hike would be if telepaths were running the Department of the Economy?They finally broke free of the mob, into a clear space in front of a drop tube.Whitey hit the button; time stretched out as they waited, chafing, unable to do anything.Then the doors valved open and more citizens streamed out, chattering,   threat to everything we believe in    probably sacrifice babies at those secret meetings they have    got to vote Pohyola in!Inside, folks, Whitey growled, and they sprang.The doors valved shut behind them, and Whitey hit the street level button.Im scared, Grandpa, Lona said softly.Comes of having brains, Whitey growled.Me, Im just terrified.Sams eyes were huge in a pale, drawn face.Dars voice was very low.These people are so scared, theyre actually going to be willing to give up all their rights!Willing?Whitey snorted.Theyre going to rush to it!Whitey  my mission   Still important, Whitey snapped.If they lose the election, theyll still try their coup.In fact, they may not wait for due process.The doors valved open.Walk calmly, Whitey growled.Dont do anything out of the ordinary.Just follow Papa.The crowd was much thinner here where people were coming into the terminal or leaving it, but there were still a lot of huddles of frantic citizens.Whitey strolled through them with his crew, retrieved his luggage, and sauntered out the ground transport door.A uniform stepped up to them with a man inside it.Mr.Tambourin?Dars heart jammed into his throat.Then he realized it didnt have any brass or badge; it couldnt be Security.Whitey turned his head slowly, glowering.Yes?Mr.Bocellos compliments, sir.Would you accept his hospitality for the next few days?Horatio always did have a great sense of timing, Whitey sighed, pressing back into the limousines seat.It responded, adjusting itself to his contours.Whats in the cupboard?Dar nodded at a sliding panel set into the wall in front of him.Why not ask the driver?Whitey nodded toward a speaker grill.Hes just on the other side of the wall.Why not?Dar pressed the panel glowing beneath the grill.Uh, can you tell me what this little cupboard in the forward wall is?A complete bar, sir, the chauffeur replied.Please feel free to drain it.I hope we have your brands stocked.Oh, anything expensive is fine, thanks.Dar slid open the hatch, grinned at the gleaming panel in front of him, checked the codes listed above it, and punched up a Deneb Dimmer.Next order?Sirian Scrambler, said Lona.Canopus Concentrate, said Sam.Chteau LaMorgue 46, said Whitey.Dar squinted at the index.Sorry, Whitey, all theyve got is a 48.Well, that wasnt a bad year, Whitey sighed.Itll do.Dar pressed in the code and glanced at Father Marco.Nothing, thanks.The priest raised a palm.I only drink in the early morning.Dar shrugged, took his tumbler out of the slot, and settled back with a contented sigh.Im beginning to see advantages to decadence.He beamed down on the city passing beneath them.Then he frowned.Whats that?Below them, a mob filled several streets, waving signs and throwing bricks.What?Whitey leaned over to the window, looking down.Hey, not bad!Lets see if we can hear them.He turned a knob and punched a button beneath the speaker grille.It filtered faint words to them:  Espers are Ethical!Dont Sell the Psis!Terra for Telepaths!Whitey nodded with satisfaction.A political demonstration.Nice to hear the voice of dissent.The bricks are bouncing back at them, Dar called.Bouncing off of thin air, in fact.What is it, a force field?Give the man a point!Lona said brightly.Youve got it, sophisticateits a force field.Makes sure the demonstrators dont hurt anybody.Therere a few Security men outside the force field   Well, you wouldnt expect them to be inside, would you?But why do they need them, with the force field?Who do you think set it up?Also, theyre the official sign that the government is hearing the citizens grievances, said Sam, with full sarcasm.The government approves?The government embraces it, almost to the point of lewdness.Theyve even written it into lawfor every hundred thousand persons demonstrating for eight hours, they get one vote on the issue in the Assembly.Dar turned to her, frowning.Sounds a little dangerous.A fad could get voted into law that way.Not when you remember that the Assembly represents ninety three human inhabited planets with a total population of eighty billion.You have to have forty eight votes just to get the issue onto the agenda!Not that it hasnt happened, mind youbut rarely, very rarely.Two of the programs based on such issues have been enacted into law, Father Marco reminded her.Two laws in five centuries?Not exactly a great track record, Father!Well, no.It does require that the majority approve the issue.Yeah.Sam slid over next to Dar and stared out the window gloomily.But some chance is better than none, I suppose.At least it gives the counterculture the illusion that they can accomplish something.They passed over three more demonstrations on the way to Bocellos; each was huge, making the pro telepath mob look like a handfuland all screaming for the telepaths blood.Whatre we getting upset about?Dar wondered.Were not telepaths!Try and prove that to Pohyola, Sam growled.What with one thing and another, their nerves were in a fine state of disarray by the time the limo landed.They stepped out into the midst of a tournament.The knights had apparently unhorsed each other; the beasts in question were standing back, watching their masters with jaundiced eyes.The knights were hewing at each other with broadswords that went CLICK!CLUNK!whenever they met.The Green Knight wore full plate armor; his opponent wore a haubergeon.Behind and above them stood a scoreboard with two outline drawings of a human form; whenever one of the knights managed to wound his opponent, the wound would show up on the scoreboard as a red light, and a chime would ring the knights number of points.Around them stood and sat a hundred or so people dressed in the latest fashion of the fourteenth century.Or the twelfth.Or the tenth.Or maybe the ninth.They nibbled at pasties and swigged ale, laughing and cheering, while peddlers circulated among them with food and drink, and troubadours and gleemen strolled about singing and chanting.An occasional monk stood near, inveighing against the evils of tournaments and enjoining the faithful to repent.Lona turned to the chauffeur.Sure you didnt take us to the wrong address?Say, maybe a mental hospital?Not at all, the chauffeur assured her.This is Mr.Bocellos house.And there it was, rising high behind the medieval crowd in full Gothic splendor, looking more like a public monument than a dwelling.A mans castle is his home, Dar murmured.Mr.Bocello is entertaining, the chauffeur explained.Just a few friends from his club.Dar eyed the crowd.Not what I think of as the usual plutocrat orgy set.Very few of them are wealthy, sir.But all share Mr.Bocellos fondness for the medieval.He has gathered them to celebrate the return to Terra of, ah, in his words, the greatest gleeman of our age.A slow grin spread over Whiteys face.Now, thats what I call honoring me according to my own taste and style!I am more of a gleeman than a poet, anyway!Come on, folksif the man does me honor, lets honor his doing!A very tall, skinny man in full ducal robes shouldered his way through the crowd with a peasant lass on his arm.Tambourin!Cello, you filthy old wastrel!Whitey reached up high to slap the dukes shoulder.Howd you get this crowd together on only a days notice?Oh, I had a few words with their employers, and they were more than happy to oblige.You didnt think you could set foot on old Terra again without causing a festival, did you?Well, I did have some nave notion about slipping in unnoticed, Whitey admitted.Bocello raised an eyebrow.What is it this timea vengeful husband, or an irate sheriff?Its more like a list, really  Oh, is it indeed!Horatio turned the peasant wench around and sent her off with a pat on the backside.Off with you, childI have a feeling were about to be saying things that you truly want to be able to claim you didnt hear.Come now, no poutingI saw the way you were eyeing that acrobat; deny it if you can  He turned back to Whitey as the girl swept off with a blush and a giggle.Now, then!Its been a while; perhaps you and your entourage would like a quick tour of my gardens?We would indeed!Preferably out in the middle of a wide expanse of lawn, free from prying mechanical eyes and ears  Ah, but one can never be totally certain of that anymore.Horatio took Whitey by the arm and led him away.Theyre doing such wonderful things with miniaturization these days.Still, my gardeners do, ah, sweep the lawns every morning, so weve a reasonably good chance  By the way, what did you think of Grevals latest epic?And they were off, happily ripping apart other artists work in the time honored tradition of amateur critics, as they wove and dodged their way through the crowd.The gang had to scramble to keep up with them, and by the time they came out onto the open grass, Dar was winded.Sam was starry eyed.Dar glanced at her, glanced again, and scowled.What was she looking moonstruck about?He glanced around quickly, but didnt see any gorgeous hunks of manhood nearby.As a last resort, he glanced back at Sam, and followed the direction of her gaze; it arrowed straight toward Horatio.Dar felt a sudden, biting jealousy, which surprised him.Now, then!Horatio stopped in the middle of a wide, open field, chewed into mud at its center.The lists are the most private place well find, at least until the next joust.Lets have your list.Whos chasing you first?The Solar Patrol, at the moment, Whitey answered with a grin, cheered on by a weasel named Canis Destinus.Canis what?Horatio frowned.Why is he on your trail?Because Im helping a friend.Whitey nodded toward Dar.And this Canis guy is chasing him because hes on a secret mission of some sort.It involves getting to the Executive Secretary for a few minutes.I think he does have an opening on his calendar, next Thursday Horatio pursed his lips.Still, its a difficult appointment to make.Especially with Canis trying to cancel it, Whitey agreed.We cant be sure, mind you, but we think hes the one whos been rousing the local police against us on every planet weve been to.There must be at least three warrants out for me, along my backtrail.Well, thats nothing new.Horatios scowl deepened.Still, I expect the honors being bestowed for the wrong reasons.What charge has he drummed up?Now, were not sure, mind you, Whitey said, frowning, but we think hes managed to convince the LORDS that were a bunch of telepaths, and that weve been aided and abetted by telepaths all along our route in from the marches.Horatio stared.Youre the Interstellar Telepathic Conspiracy?Well, that is kinda what we think theyve got in their heads, yeah, Whitey muttered.Horatio glared down at him, his face slowly turning purple.Dar stood frozen, with his heart in his throat.If Whitey were just a little bit mistaken about his old buddy, they could all wind up in prison at the snap of a finger.He could fairly feel that restraining field pressing in on him from all sides already  Then Horatio blew.Foul!he bellowed, fingers clawing into fists.How foul, how fell!That the High Gleeman of scores of worlds should be hounded and harassed like a common felon!And all for the brain sick nightmare of a diseased and petty mind!Nay, nay!I have stood and smiled, I have gnashed my teeth whiles I watched them play their petty games of plot and counterplot; I have schooled myself to patience while the reek of their corruption stank in my nostrilsbut this I cannot bear!Nay, how can there be any gram of goodness biding in a sovereignty thats so riddled with malice that it dreams up excuses to harry its bravest and best?Terra is become a stench filled sty, a globe no longer fit for glee, a domain no longer fit for dwellingnor can any planet be that falls within its sphere of influence!Whitey dug in his toes and braced himself against the gale.Peace, now, peace, good fellow!Hope lives on yet!Even corruption has its day, and ceases, and the seeds of goodness sprout up from it, to flower again in virtue!Aye, but in how many years?Horatio glowered down at him.Nay, centuries!I am not minded to hold my peace and bear myself in silence whiles I wait!Dar felt a surge of panic.Was this madman going to try a one man rebellion, or something?But Whitey suddenly became very casual.Well then, if you truly feel so, flee!There be no dearth of G type suns, nor of worlds like Terra.If you find all known worlds so swinishly unfit, go seek the unknown!Go sail into uncharted skies and find a world to make anew, after the fashion of your dreaming!Dar held his breath.What Whitey was saying was, in effect, put up or shut up.But Horatio was staring at him as though hed spoken an idea never thought of before.Aye, he breathed.Aye, surely!He whirled away toward the house, crying, Where are these hearts?Where are my comrades?The whole group stared at his retreating back.I, ah, think we might want to go along with him, Whitey suggested.He sometimes needs restraining when he gets into these moods.He set off after Horatio.The troupe followed, and caught up with him.Whats the matter with her?Whitey muttered to Dar.Huh?Dar glanced at Sam, who was moving a little more quickly than the rest of them, gaze fixed on Horatio, eyes shining.He turned back to Whitey.Just spellbound.Money has that effect, sometimes.But Whitey shook his head.Not so, or shed have gone after me.Would you say Sams the impulsive sort?Well  in a way.Dar frowned at Sam, seeing her anew.Controls it well, though.And Horatio doesnt have to.Whitey nodded.That explains a lot.Dar was glad it did, because he didnt understand a bit of it.On the other hand, he hadnt had much exposure to women who spoke his own language.Horatio stormed up a flight of limestone steps and wheeled through French doors into his palace.By the time the crew caught up with him, he was leaning across a Louis XIV desk, glaring into a phone screen at an image of a bulky, black haired man with a flowing beard.Ship?he was saying.Of course you can buy a ship, Horatio!The Navy has surplus dreadnoughts it would love to be rid ofbut why?To issue from a sty of stenches!Horatio snapped.What do you mean, they have ships theyd love to be rid of?Always more on hand than they have buyers for.After all, whod want a retired battleshipwithout its cannon?We would!To bear a crew of colonists to a brave new world, where we may purify ourselves of this crass materialism, and rise above the suspiciousness and greed of this technological monster of a world!Horatio.Blackbeard eyed him warily.Do you speak of founding a society based on the Society?Indeed I do, Markone!I was afraid that this might come, Markone sighed.You must not confuse the pleasant fantasy of our Society tournaments and moots with the reality of the real world, Horatio.That way lies madness.
