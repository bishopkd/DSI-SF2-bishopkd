We both ended up stronger for it.Really changed my life, come to think of it.How?They put me on a suicide hotline, of all things.I was sullen and bitchy about it at first, but then something changed.I started listening to people, and it was the first time I felt like I had a purpose.Like I was doing good in the world.That led me to the Corps.Your whole career is just making up for a guilty conscience, then?Thats one way to look at it.See if I waste a perfectly good inspirational story on you again.Alright.Tell me another way to look at it?Theres a couple different angles.Maybe I found my true calling, or maybe I learned there was value in trying to make things right.Maybe I found myself on a career track and just went where it led me.Maybe maybe I was totally infatuated with a girl in the call center, and chased her tail right into the Corps.Which is it?A combination.Answers are rarely simple, my friend.So, what was your biggest mistake?Kai was quiet for a long while.Something worse.Something a lot worse.Jack didnt know what his new friend was hiding, but the mans remorse left a sour smell in the air.Listen No matter what you did, the important thing is who you become in the wake of it.Usually, Id say its never too late to make it right, but well, it may be too late to make it right.Yeah.Thanks, Jack.No problem.Gnight, Kai.Night.Chapter 42:  The Wake of It  Kai was gone when Jack woke up the next morning.That should have told him something, but he was too busy trying not to let it get to him.He tried to take it in stride, and was partially successful.Only partially.Against his own better judgment, hed become attached to the guy, even though either one could disappear at any moment.One of them had.Jack found it odd that he couldnt quite picture Kais face, even after spending weeks trapped together in an empty room, and it troubled him.He felt heartless for not remembering.Inhuman.He decided that Kai must have had the single most forgettable face in the world.It was the only rational explanation.Even though Jack and God were on the outs again, he said a small prayer for his doughy faced Finnish friend and hoped for the best.Then he went back to his routine of merciless exercise, and tried to think nothing else of it.He was partially successful in that as well.Working himself to slobbering exhaustion certainly helped.Then, shortly after his dinner meal, the inexplicable happened.Jack was sitting on the floor with his back to the wall, and the opposite wall melted away like a sheet of ice suddenly hit by a blast furnace.The fascist alien interrogator stood in the opening.Jack didnt waste any time.His opportunity had come.The one hed been training for.He propelled himself up from the ground and scrambled toward the enemy, fists swinging.His first blow landed with a loud crack and the aliens head jerked to the side.The second fist crashed into the aliens gut, and it felt like hitting concrete.Even in his blind fury, Jack realized he wasnt having any effect.The alien stood unperturbed, no more wounded than if Jack had splashed him with lukewarm water.It was the most insulting thing possible.It made Jack feel weak and powerless.Why wont you fight back?he growled.His arm tightened and exploded, charged with every last ounce of his strength.Fight me!The alien shrugged the blow off just as he had the others.Dont you think Ive hurt you enough?he asked.Jack didnt quite know how to answer that.The alien had hurt him more than enough, but this wasnt how he imagined things turning out.In his dreams, they would clash and fight like savage animals, only to perish with their hands at each others throats.I offer you two options, the interrogator said, Kill me if you like.I wont resist.Or I can lead you out of this place.You will not escape without my assistance.The choice is yours.Escape.The mere thought of it hurt.Jack had banished that idea from his mind so long ago he couldnt even imagine it anymore.This had to be some kind of trap, but what if it wasnt?Why?The word barely escaped his mouth.Theres no time to explain right now.Ill answer your questions once were outside, but we must leave now.Decide, Jack Hernandez.The alien held out Jacks handgun, handle first, and offered it to him.Jack snatched the gun out of the aliens gloved hand, pulled back the slide and inspected the chamber.There was a copper jacketed round sitting inside.He released the slide and it clacked back into place, then he raised the gun up and placed it against the interrogators head.The alien didnt so much as twitch.Jacks finger slid to the trigger.The metal was cool to the touch.It begged for him to do it.It cried out for Jack to end the miserable creatures existence, so he could never hurt anyone again.Jack lowered the gun.I hope you made the right decision, the interrogator said.So do I.   The alien stepped aside and motioned to a pile of clothes against the wall.I brought your things.Dress quickly, then follow me.We must leave while the guard detail is being changed.It took Jack less than thirty seconds to discard his dirty rags and climb back into his underclothes and jumpsuit.In another ten, his holsters and duty pack were fastened and the assault rifle was slung across his back.He felt like a different man.He felt a bit like himself again.He slid the handgun into its holster and said, Lets go.The interrogator led a winding route through the building, passing huge blocks honeycombed with cells just like Jacks.The hallways were empty, and the guard stations abandoned.The creature ran effortlessly, and Jack struggled just to keep up.They reached the rooftop, and Jack was struck with vertigo.The great blue city stretched out in all directions, and he felt lost, dizzy and nauseous all at the same time.He buckled over and started breathing deeply.Are you okay?Yeah, Jack said as he stood back up.Been cooped up in a shoe box too long.Its a lot to take in all at once.You must recover quickly.Were not yet in the clear.The rooftop was circular, with stables around the outside housing open topped flyers, each attached to a hose full of greenish fluid.You gonna fly one of these things?The interrogator shook his head.No.I am unable to operate Yuon Kwon.So its a dead end then.What the hell?You must fly it.Come again?Jack asked incredulously.Your species possesses all of the organs necessary to interface with Yuon Kwon.That doesnt make any damn sense, Jack said.I wish I could disagree with you.The interrogator turned and jogged toward one of the flyers and waved Jack on with his hand.Come.We must hurry, Jack.Jack followed.They climbed into the flyer, the inside of which was much like the walker Jack had inspected in the field.After a moment, he noticed a distinct difference, though.This one was alive.The walls were warm to the touch, and when he reached out to touch it, the creature cooed.Hurry.What?How do I do this?Climb into the pilots cradle.It will adjust to you, and  And what?Im not sure.If were lucky, youll figure it out.We must hurry, or we wont make the rendezvous.Jack stepped to the front where the empty cradle hung open.If this was all an intricate trap, Jack could imagine easier ways for the interrogator to kill him.He rolled up his sleeves and slowly lowered himself in.The inside was warm and humid, with a musky odor that wasnt entirely unpleasant.It reminded Jack of reaching into an open wound.Then it quivered and cinched down tight, while insectoid arms gripped him around the midsection.This is disgusting.His voice was muffled.Jack  I dont know what do.Something flashed, and Jack had blind spots like hed just looked at the sun.He blinked his eyes and tried to clear them.There was another flash more intense than the first.Somethings happening, he said.When the third flash struck, Jack experienced something strange.The strangest thing in his life.Even weirder than his stint with those mushrooms.He touched another creatures mind and saw through its eyes.Its working, he thought he said.He wasnt sure if he said it or thought it.Things had gotten messy.Can you get us airborne?The interrogators voice had a weird echo.I think so, he said, and then he made it happen.Jack felt the fin around the edge of himself spin up, the cycling sound filling the air, and the flyer climbed out of its stall.The attached hose tugged back for a moment, but its connector snapped away and he was free.Good.Now take us toward those towers, then head left and follow traffic until we reach the edge of the city.Jack was overwhelmed.He was flying.It all had to be dream.He was still lying on the floor of his prison cell, and none of this was real.So he approached it as a dream, and he flew.He flew free, jetting through traffic and banking through the air.He darted between the other flyers, and flipped a quick barrel roll.Calm down, Jack.Youre going to attract attention if you keep this up.Sorry, he said, and he slid back into traffic like a good little boy.After a few minutes of travel, he reached the citys end and slid back out of traffic and into open skies.Out into freedom.If this was a dream, Jack never wanted to wake up.Chapter 43:  Rendezvous  The interrogator directed Jack eastward and the small flyer sped over dense rainforest.Trees beneath them started orange, then turned green after a few kilometers and finally thinned out at the foot of the Virunga Mountains.Set down in that clearing, the interrogator said, and Jack did.The flyer neared the ground and its stubby legs extended, then bent under the weight as the vehicle kissed the Earth.Just as Jack began to wonder how to remove himself from the cradle, the vehicle released him.He was back in the real world.Back in his own body.The experience was disorienting beyond belief.The night was dark and rain had just begun to fall.The feeling of standing there beneath the clouds, splashed by rain and caressed by the warm winds, was simply brilliant.Jacks skin was caked with months worth of filth, and he wanted nothing more than to stand in the rain and feel clean again.Feel new again.I should kill you, Jack said after a long silence.You still have the option.He considered reaching for his gun, but he had too many questions that needed answers.The interrogator might have been suicidal, but he hadnt worn out his usefulness.Not yet.Will you tell me whats going on?Where should I begin?the alien asked.Jacks shoulders were soaking wet, and the water trickled down over the rest of him.Is Kai your real name, or was that just a cover?Real name.When did you figure it out?Not until you handed me the gun.You called me Jack.So, I gather youre not Finnish, but how do look so human?Our shape is similar.For the rest, I altered my outward appearance.I created a disguise in order to gain your trust.Helluva disguise, Jack said.I bought it hook, line and sinker.He listened to the melodic pitter patter on the leaves all around him.Just that morning, he was sure hed never hear that sound again, yet there he was.That cant be everything you want to know.Of course not, Jack said.He took a tentative step out of the flyer and onto the wet soil, fearing it would disappear the moment he touched it.When he was confident it was real and not going anywhere, he took another step and then sat down among the plants.I want to know how this all happened.How did we end up here?Kai walked over to him, and Jack motioned for him to sit down.Its a long story, Kai said.Take your time.Im a patient man.Kai pulled his mask off and shoved it in his jacket, then took a deep breath.As you wish.It starts thirty two of your years ago.My people, the Somari, had just come out of a century long war, and for the first time in our history, our people were united.It was the dawn of a new age of prosperity, fueled by the technological advances made during the war.What sort of advances?Kai smiled.Genetic engineering.Biotechnology.The ability to manufacture new bodies from whole cloth, and transfer minds from one to the next.So youre  Enhanced.A biotech construct.This is my third body, counting the one in which I was born.Okay.Now we come to the part of the story where something terrible happens.Yes.The Nefrem happened.Their battle fleet appeared in orbit one day and laid siege to our planet.Just like that, we were embroiled in war again.We thought we could defeat them, but their forces were too numerous.Too powerful.It took them only thirteen days to conquer our world, and our Archon chose to destroy it rather than concede defeat.He would not allow them to devour us.Devour you?Thats how the Nefrem operate.Ill spare you the details.Thanks.So how did you survive?I was placed in a bottle and set adrift on the sea of stars.And you ended up where?Other Sinits like me infiltrators they discovered which star systems the Nefrem were targeting, and the Archons dying wish was that I be sent to warn them.And?Five years later, my capsule arrived in the Oikeya system.The code be praised, Jack You simply cant imagine all the many strange wonders of that system.It was so rich and full of life.Three whole living worlds!Three, each with a completely unique ecosystem and collection of intelligent species.And that was only the beginning.Out among the asteroids were gargantuan membranous sacks full of water.Islands in space, each of them alive and intelligent, and full of yet more creatures.Life, free of the shackles of gravity.And all of it brought together, interconnected by living space ships that fly as naturally as a fish swims through water.Sounds too good to be true.I know.I thought the same thing every moment I was among them.I was sure I had died and gone to heaven?The Oikeyans had no concept of war or hatred.No struggle or strife.They lived in peaceful harmony with one another, and they were all so very naive.He was quiet for a long pause.When I told them the destroyers were coming, they laughed.They actually laughed.Whatd you do?Everything I could.I preached to whoever would listen, and trained whoever would learn.I traveled the system for eight years trying to build some kind of defense, until the Nefrem advance fleet finally arrived.The Oikeyans greeted them with open arms and paid dearly for the mistake.Millions died before my forces were able to turn the fleet away.But they came back?Of course.The destroyers returned in numbers that made a mockery of their assault on my homeworld, and they brought their living planet this time.The war was over before it ever began.How many died?Forty billion, Jack.Slaughtered, eaten and churned out into more Nefrem.The sixty million refugees here on Earth they are all that remains.But why come here, Kai?Why like this?You couldve asked us for help.Kai looked him dead in the eyes.Because you are Nefrem.We look like them?No, Jack.You are them, and there can be no mistake in this.Youre genetically identical.We only learned of this world from them.The location of your system was cleverly hidden in their databanks.It was heavily encrypted and obscured behind falsified information, and I believed the secrecy was to prevent enemies from discovering the location of their homeworld.So you brought the Oikeyans here to strike back.Yes.We came prepared to wage the final battle.To tear out the weed at its root.The plan was to take the Nefrem by surprise and wipe out their civilization before they could mount a counter offensive, and in that, we were fairly successful.Except were not the Nefrem, Jack said while shaking his head.This doesnt make any sense.Weve always been here.We evolved here, and until you arrived, we were pretty sure there wasnt life out there at all.I mean, weve only just taken our first baby steps out onto other planets, for Christs sake.I know that now.In fact, your people survived precisely because youre not the Nefrem.They live in hives the size of your largest cities.They have no farmland or suburbs.If you lived like that, you would have already been destroyed.Im so glad this has been a learning experience for you, Kai.Really.I mean that.Sarcasm aside, the truth is that I cant turn back time, and I cant undo what Ive done, but we still have a choice about who to become in the wake of this.Yeah, I know the guy who said that.I do too, and hes an amazing creature.After everything thats been done to him everything hes seen and been through, he still refuses to kill innocents.He could have destroyed the entire city in a flash of light, but he chose not to.I subjected him to more pain than any living thing could be expected to endure, and yet he spared my life.He must be a God damned idiot.Not at all.Youre a better man than even you realize, Jack Hernandez, and theres something noble inside of you that I dont understand.Something luminous that I couldnt snuff out no matter how hard I tried.I will never cultivate a soul like yours, but I can become a weapon of your will, and perhaps atone for some of my mistakes.And if I prefer you dead?Then Ill die.I deserve no less, and I know it but I dont think youll make that decision.You know that I can do more good alive than dead.Well see, Jack said.No offense, but this all seems a little too convenient.Youll excuse me if I dont lead you straight back to the resistance.I understand your apprehension, but Ive no reason to deceive you.Your people have gotten sloppy in recent months.Your primary installations have already been located and dealt with, and all that remains are the fortified shelters Arks, I believe you call them.The Oikeyans are mounting a final offensive as we speak, with the intent of finishing the fight once and for all.Humanity doesnt have much time left.They both sat there and listened to the falling rain.Then a motion in the distance caught Jacks eye, and he struggled to focus.Months of captivity had left his vision less sharp than it once was, and with some effort, he made out a rhino and two jackrabbits moving down the hillside.His first instinct was panic.Weve got company!he shouted and scrambled up from the ground.Relax, Kai said.Theyre friends.What?There are objectors among the Oikeyans that still believe life is sacred above all else.They want to end the war.When I informed them I was going to free you, these three volunteered to accompany us.Every muscle in Jacks body was rigid and his heart was racing.Kai might have spent months torturing Jack, but at least he looked human.The exterminators were a different story.They still had a profound effect on him, and the sight alone sent adrenaline surging through his blood.Fuck me.Okay.I can handle this.Accompany us where exactly, Kai?Up to you.Figures, Jack said.With that, he dropped back down and laid himself out in the ground cover.The rain fell harder every minute, and he was wet like a river.For the time being, can I just lie here?I just want to lie here in the rain for a while.If thats what you wish.Should I go somewhere else?Jack thought about it for a second and then said, No.I may not like you, but youre all I have.Ive already had my share of solitude.As you wish.Chapter 44:  Dead Sea  All told, fourteen months had passed since the beginning of the invasion, and Jack had spent four of them in captivity.Four months without sunshine.One hundred and eighteen days locked in a box, tortured and left to stew in his own despair while the world outside shambled on without him.Now he was free.His flyer sliced through the air at more than two hundred kilometers an hour, racing northward over the vibrant green jungle.Jack and the strange vehicle were intimately connected, but at the same time separate in a way that baffled him.The feeling of sheer, unbridled speed reminded him of riding a motorcycle, but taken to an unimaginable extreme, while the play between mount and master was more like riding a horse.Not that hed ever ridden a horse, but hed heard stories.As they traveled, he was taken aback by how quickly nature had reclaimed her world.Jack had always heard that the Earth abides, but the swiftness of it disturbed him.The ashen cities were already grown over with fresh vegetation, and only the twisted metal spires hinted that anything had been there at all.Human civilization had been erased and forgotten.It left him feeling like civilization hadnt been an integral part of the world, but had rather existed in spite of it.Mankind had been bailing water from a leaky ship, and in the absence of his attention, the tides rose up and swept it all away.Jack and his companions stopped every few hours so the flyer could rest and graze.It wasnt like the larger cuttlefish in this regard, which were self sufficient and capable of space travel.This flyer was a commuter, and the city was its natural habitat.It was less than ideal outside of the city, and its reliance on external energy made it essentially useless after nightfall.By the end of the first day, they reached the shores of the Red Sea where they camped for the night.Although Jack logically understood that the others could kill him at any time, the danger felt doubled once the sun went down.It bothered him so much that he hardly slept.When morning came, they returned to the air and quickly crossed the sea, and Jack was once again in the Mideast.Another seven hours after that, they arrived at the former site of Al Saif on the shores of the Dead Sea, and Jack confirmed what Kai had told him.Nothing remained of the base but a trash heap, the enemy having overrun the resistance more than a month before.After an exhaustive search, Jack found himself wandering the ruins, and he paced for a long time while imagining how the battle went down, piecing together what he could from the debris.The airstrip had been torn to shreds, and various parts of the temporary buildings littered the ground, but he didnt see vehicle wreckage anywhere.Satisfied?Kai asked.Not quite the right word, but yeah  He tried to reconcile what he remembered of the bases layout with the destruction all around him, in hopes of discovering a hidden weapons cache somewhere.It was a more difficult task than he might have gussed.Kai had a frustrated look on his face.He was restless, but he held his tongue.I bet youre wondering what were doing here, Jack said.The question crossed my mind.Trying to figure out if youre telling the truth about well, anything.Seems you are.The world is full of surprises, no?Jack smiled in spite of himself.Now, theres good news and bad news in this slag pile.The good news is that the resistance saw the attack coming, and evacuated before you all got here.How can you tell?Trucks, planes.This place was rotten with em, but theres no sign of any here.The only explanation is that they got the hell out of dodge before the fireworks started.Whered they get the information  Ancient Chinese secret.Ill never tell.Fair answer.And the bad news?Since they had time to pack up and leave, Im betting they took most of their supplies with em.I was hoping to pick up a little extra firepower, but theres nothing but rubbish here.Kai looked at him like he was absolutely mad.Maybe I wasnt clear, Jack.Theres a legion marching toward the Ark right now.Armor, siege weapons and more than a million ground troops.We cant fight them on our own.I know, Jack said, but I like to keep my options open.You can solve a lot of problems with a honking big pile of explosives.Looking at the remains of Al Saif didnt exactly fill him with confidence.It looked like a hurricane had hit the base.An angry hurricane that was on fire, and full of lawnmower blades.Off on the other side of the ruins, the rhino waved and shouted something.His deep voice carried a surprising distance over open ground.Kai cupped his hands to his mouth and shouted something back in a language Jack was beginning to recognize if not understand.Whatd he say?He asked if you were done moping around yet.And?I told him youd be done soon.Dont make a liar of me, Jack.He wasnt sure whether to laugh or be angry at that.Well hit the road in a bit.Riddle me this though, Mr.Space Ninja what the hell am I supposed to do?If I knew that, Id have done it already.Dont worry.Youre a resourceful guy.Youll think of something.Jack shook his head.You either have too much faith, or a really strange sense of humor.The alien picked up a piece of ruined metal and spun it around in his hand, trying to determine its original purpose.After a moment of fruitless head scratching, he cocked his arm back and threw it far into the distance.It occurred to Jack that the hunk of metal must have weighed more than twenty kilos, yet Kai handled it like a baseball.They could have at least left me a bottle of hooch, Jack said after a while.Hooch?Booze.Alcohol.Fermentation of fruit or grain, ingested to produce intoxication.You had me at alcohol.Ah.Jack took one last look at the wreckage all around, shook his head and said, Thats enough.Lets get out of here.Then he turned and started off toward the flyer.Kai followed.Where to?I want to see this alien legion.You know where theyll be?Give or take.About two days ride at our current rate.Would they pay any attention to one of their own flyers buzzing them?Probably not, as long as you dont act too suspicious.Good.Im gonna prep the flyer.Go get the others.Will do, Kai said, and then he got a funny look on his face.By the way ummm whats a ninja?Jack laughed.They were assassins who excelled at sneaking into enemy castles and eliminating targets unseen.The movies got carried away, and portrayed them as unstoppable killing machines with mystical abilities.Its kind of silly.I learn something new every day, Kai said with a smile.Then he turned and ran off at a speed thatd make an Italian sports car blush.It took Jack the entire walk back to the flyer to convince himself what he saw was real, and not just some fanciful hallucination.Chapter 45:  Millipede  Jack and his four alien companions traveled north, from the dusty beige of the Mideast to the green hills and roiling mountains of Eastern Turkey.Jack had never seen the Turkish landscape before, and the mountains there spiked out of the ground defiantly as if the Earth itself were invading the sky.The intensity of the steep mountains and gorges took his breath away, and he badly wanted to stop and explore.There wasnt any time for that, though, and they flew on.Turkey gave way to green Georgia, followed by the Caucasus Mountains, a line of snow capped peaks which stood in a row like jagged teeth.On the other side, they found themselves in the remains of Russia, whose abandoned farmland stretched out in all directions like a patchwork quilt, so large that Jack thought hed never see the end of it.The colder climate and high altitudes slowed their progress, but they finally caught up with the Oikeyan legion after nearly three days of travel.The legion wasnt difficult to find, like a insanely large herd of buffalo lumbering across the land, stretching more than fifty kilometers from beginning to end.It was populated by strange creatures, some as large as container ships, and attended by swarms of flyers darting from one part of the pack to the next, like flocks of birds before a storm.The multitude of stomping feet kicked up a dust cloud that billowed out toward the horizon and covered the ground in a dense and impenetrable haze.Jack, joined to the flyer he named Felix, approached the herd cautiously from behind, nipping at their heels.Holy crap, his disembodied voice said once he was close enough to really appreciate the scale of it.A rumble filled the air like endless thunder.You see, Kai said, we cant fight this.Even the Nefrem would have trouble standing before this kind of force.Jack and Felix surged forward, weaving into and through the formation.He flew up alongside one of the great grey walkers, and marveled at the locomotive sized cannon mounted atop it.He imagined a weapon that big could crack a mountain in two.We could talk to them, maybe convince them to stop.Come on, Jack do they look like theyre in a talking mood?Kai shouted over the roar.Theres gotta be someone in charge who could put a stop to this.Some leadership.There is, Kai said, The ones you call pilots are in control.The Alarhya.But they wont listen to anyone anymore.What changed?Your tactics.Your kind left Yuon Kwon mangled and broken in the field, and that infuriated the Alarhya.They consider the vehicles sacred.When the suicide bombings began, it was the final straw.Suicide bombings!What suicide bombings?It started after your capture.Generators were too difficult to reach, so the terrorists went after population centers.Markets, parks and the like.I dont blame your people, but you see how these things escalate?Jack peeled away from the walker and continued on through the herd, sliding between a pair of smaller creatures and then under the long legs of another massive walking cannon.His skills in darting through traffic had been honed to a razors edge through years of navigating highway 101 at rush hour, and the comparatively sparse and evenly spaced vehicles in the Oikeyan herd posed little challenge.The legion inspired awe and terror in the same breath, and for the life of him, Jack couldnt imagine anything he could do about it.He was watching an avalanche roll down a mountain in slow motion.He couldnt stop the avalanche, but there was still a chance to warn the village in its path.They couldnt fight it, but they might be able to get out of the way.Where could a couple hundred million refugees go, though?Where could they hide that the legion wouldnt hunt them down and slaughter them?Jacks disembodied voice asked, Do you know their game plan?Theyre still using my organization and tactics.Did you see the long necked Yuon Kwon at the back of the pack?With lots of legs?Those are the ones.Constructors.Theyll build fortresses and gun emplacements in a wide circle around the Ark to isolate it.Then the siege cannons move into place and beat the enemy into dust.Power comes from a young city Yuon Kwon that will hang back away from the fight.I dont see it.He wont come until the battle lines are secured.Kais description generally agreed with what Jack had seen at Al Saif.There were deep indentations in the ground where the temporary fortifications had sat, and Al Saif itself looked to have been blasted from multiple directions at once.Jack and Felix continued on through the pack, studying all the many new types of Yuon Kwon hed never seen before.There were walkers in all shapes and sizes, covered in weapons both familiar and not.The vast majority of flyers were the cuttlefish type Jack had often seen since the invasion began, but there were also groups of heavier flyers weighted down with payloads of seed shaped bombs.Jack felt a strange kinship with the Yuon Kwon all around him, and he started to wonder what the long term effects of piloting Felix might be.So the young city thats the legions weak spot?If it has a weak spot, then yes.The city is the lynch pin of whole organization, but dont think its defenseless.Itll be bristling with weaponry and have a large population of Sey Chen covering it in defensive membranes.Sey Chen?You call them monks.They have peculiar abilities.And the defensive membranes?You mean like force fields or something?Whats a force field?Never mind.The two jackrabbits said something in the common language, quickly and tensely.Whatever they were talking about was worrying them.Ferash and Niko said were picking up unwanted attention.If youve seen what you need to see, we should leave, Jack.Jack hadnt seen what he wanted.He was hoping for the impossible; a weak underbelly that he could stab at to stop the attack before it started.Hed learned as much as he could, though, and he allowed himself to drift to the back of the pack.When hed fallen sufficiently behind the Oikeyan legion, he pulled away and headed for the hills to rest and think about his next move.Whatever that would be.Chapter 46:  Homecoming  Farmland gave way to the wide Russian steppe as Jack and his alien companions headed toward the Ark.The nearly flat land went on and on, covered in short tufts of grass and little else.It was the most boring country Jack had ever laid eyes on, and hed seen some pretty boring places in his time.This one took the boring cake and ate it with a boring glass of milk.Worse yet, the sparse grass of the steppe made it more difficult to keep Felix well fed, and the small flyer couldnt maintain top speed for as long as he could in sunnier, more abundant regions.Progress slowed to a crawl across that flat, uneventful countryside, and the only bright side was that the Oikeyan legion would undoubtedly be slowed as well.The travelers camped under the stars and ate reheated alien field rations twice a day.The food was a version of the same multi colored stuff Jack had eaten in prison, but more energy dense and flavorful.It was bitter and nearly unpalatable.While it provided all the nutrients he needed, his stomach constantly felt empty, and from the sour look on the rhinos face, he felt the same way.As they traveled, Kai took it upon himself to teach Jack the Oikeyan common language called Mirresh, which was used for interspecies communication.As Kai described it, every race had their own variety of ethnic groups, each with its own languages and dialects, but all Oikeyans knew Mirresh, and their public discourse and law were exclusively conducted in it.Much to Jacks surprise, it was easy to pick up.So easy that he was speaking Mirresh with a limited vocabulary within the first week.Prior to that, hed believed himself incapable of learning a second language, let alone one from beyond the stars.Once they could communicate, Jack got to know the three other aliens, despite his instincts otherwise.The rhinos name was Dojer, and his race called themselves Rozom.He belonged to the worker caste, which entailed having a long legged bug bonded to his blowhole as a child.It caused him to grow larger and stronger than the rest of his kind, and develop a hard, silicate armor.Surprisingly, the bug was also intelligent, but his species, known as Marakhya, were shy and preferred to let their Rozom do all the talking.Jack couldnt even begin to pronounce the Marakhyas name, and was glad it wasnt too friendly.Dojer however proved to be very talkative after a short warm up.The hulking creature was full of stories that all ended with puzzling punch lines and him belly laughing, but which left Jack confused.Rozom humor just wasnt Jacks cup of tea.The two jackrabbits were a mated pair named Ferash and Niko, and their species called themselves Kitsu.If these two were any indication, the Kitsu were a playful and almost childlike race with boundless curiosity and a keen interest in machines.They hounded Jack for just a peek at his guns and other gadgets, and when he finally caved in, the pair took turns taking everything apart and putting it back together again.This would have infuriated him, but they did a better job cleaning and maintaining his gear than he ever had.Jack got the impression that Ferash, the male of the pair, was a dreamer and maybe even an artist of some kind before he became a soldier.He often went off alone to stare at the horizon in deep thought.Niko, his mate, let him be during those stretches and instead spent the time avidly listening to Dojers weird stories.Both Ferash and Niko yearned to raise children, but thought it a mistake to bring new lives into such a troubled world.Much to Jacks surprise and dismay, the Kitsu were affectionate.Their extended families shared close living quarters and often slept in communal rooms, which Jack discovered one morning when he awoke to find both Ferash and Niko cuddled up against him.He shooed them away the first few times but it became more effort than it was worth.Besides, they were warm.At least Dojer didnt want to cuddle.Jack didnt think he could cope with that.Or survive it.They reached the Ark after nearly three straight weeks of travel.Dojer, Ferash and Niko stayed with Felix, hidden in one of the few nearby copses, while Jack and Kai approached on foot.Soon, they were in the vast, sprawling village that had sprung up around the underground shelter.The place filled Jack with both hope and despair.It provided a clear example of what the human race had been reduced to, as well as their ability to plod on in the face of abject adversity.The buildings were makeshift and sloppy.Impromptu dirt roads wandered everywhere, lined with firepits, all kinds of livestock, and dirt faced refugees bundled up in whatever clothes they could find.Jack felt like he was walking through a high school reproduction of medieval times, where the students wore costumes made out of old hand me downs.It was mass poverty on a scale hed never seen before, clothed in the waste of recent prosperity.The great artificial mound that was the Ark dominated the sky beyond the village, like a crashing tsunami frozen in place.Large metal hatches covered its surface, looking like pressure release valves or connectors for impossibly large hoses.Great.My people are living in an ant hill, Jack said as they marched.Whats an ant?Small insects that live in large underground hives.Known for ruining picnics.Perhaps humans and Nefrem have more in common than we thought.Perhaps, Jack said, and they continued on.It took the better part of the day to reach the Arks southern entrance, a concrete tunnel at ground level set in the side of the mound.Large enough for three commuter trains to fit through side by side, it was guarded by a handful of soldiers in unmatched uniforms, and no traffic went in or out.As they approached, one of the soldiers stepped out to meet them.His uniform was a dark green woodland camouflage, with a pattern common among Slavic countries.He said something in one of the many languages Jack didnt understand.English?Jack said.Anglistina?The soldier turned to his mates and spat out a mouthful of words.Another of the soldiers sauntered over and said, Only military personnel is allowed in Ark right now.We apologize for inconvenience.Yeah, thats great, Jack replied.Im with the resistance out of Al Saif.Tell Colonel Galili that Jack Hernandez is here with information about the enemy.Hell want to see me.The soldiers shared a couple words, and the one who didnt speak any English jogged back to the guard post and picked up an old style wired telephone.The handset was shaped like a barbell, and Jack had only seen models of its like in classic movies and period pieces.He almost laughed.The soldier chattered then waited, then chattered again and waited some more.After twenty minutes of this, he returned, gave the English speaking soldier some instructions and finally returned to his post.He says to take you inside.Welcome to the Ark.Without another word, he turned and walked down the tunnel.Jack and Kai followed, and after fifty meters, they were in a whole new world.The inside of the Ark was oddly warm, and after its cavernous loading dock, not so oddly cramped.Tunnels meandered off in every direction, marked by multi colored stripes on the walls that lead to different sections and departments.The soldier led them down a tunnel to an elevator which carried them up several levels, then through another tunnel only to ride a second elevator down a few levels, and finally through one last tunnel until it opened into a huge staging area.Mobs of soldiers moved and inventoried stacks of steel cargo containers while more soldiers in the distance performed tasks Jack couldnt make out.The Slavic soldier told Jack and Kai to wait near the entrance, then turned and disappeared the way he came.Its safe to say somethings going on here, Kai said as he looked around.Something big, Jack agreed.They stood there doing nothing for ten minutes, and then someone called Jacks name.The wolfish Colonel Galili came marching across the crowded floor with a look of utter disbelief on his face.Its really you under that beard?Not a lot of razors in alien prisons.Galili walked right up to Jack, grabbed both of his shoulders and shook him a bit as if to test that he was real.I thought the guards were pulling a joke on me, but no Here you are, Mr.Hernandez.There truly isnt anything in this universe that can kill you orange jumpsuits.Nothing yet, Jack said, wondering how many times hed heard that same exchange.Listen Colonel, Id love to catch up, but Ive got some pressing news.Theres a big damn force stomping this way, and we need to evacuate.We already know, and lets just say that preparations are under way.The colonels tone hinted at something he wasnt prepared to share.I dont think you understand, sir.Im talking about the kind of attack that nothing could survive.Enough firepower to level mountains.We have the matter well in hand, and thats all I can say for the time being.Youll just have to trust me, Jack.Come, walk with me.I have a thousand questions.Your friend hes trustworthy?The three started walking past the crates.Jack wasnt completely sure how to answer the colonels question.Trust was a slippery issue.Yeah, he said after a spell, hes the one that broke me out.Colonel Galili, this is Kai Makinen.Pleased to meet you, Mr.Makinen.Thats a very interesting uniform.Finnish covert ops, Kai said.Very covert.Very covert indeed, to have slipped in and retrieved our man here without a scratch.The colonel had a look in his eyes like hed just been shortchanged at the market.I cant thank you enough, he said.Kai ducked his head and said, It was the least I could do, sir.There was a strange look in his eyes as well, but Jack couldnt quite put a finger on it.Now then, Mr.Hernandez the higher ups will want to debrief you in full, but I was hoping you could fill in some details for me first.There were parts of your teams report that could use a little clarification.Jack had a sneaking suspicion lurking around his head, but he jammed it down and instructed it to shut its mouth.However I can help, Colonel.When you were in the generator room, how did the enemy detect your presence?Im not sure.One moment we were standing there, and then the situation went all pear shaped.Red lights and sirens all over the city.Why not plant the explosives then?It wouldve taken another thirty seconds at most.Jacks people had left things out, and he had no way of knowing what story theyd concocted.He was in a very sticky position all of a sudden, and he decided to tie his hitch to the truth.I dont know what youve been told, Colonel, but I had already decided to abort the mission before the alarm was sounded.As I feared, the colonel said, his voice heavy with disappointment.Do you understand how far back you set us?That bombing could have turned the entire war around.Ive got a bad feeling about this,  Kai said in Mirresh.But you werent strong enough to do what needed to be done.After what those bastards did to our world, you didnt have the intestinal fortitude to finish the job.You turned your back on your own species.Crippled our ability to strike at them.Jack  And now you come here and tell me to run?To turn tail and flee like a coward?How dare you!There were women and children.Innocents, Colonel.They are people just like us, and I wont have that kind of carnage on my head.The colonel moved with such speed that Jack hardly saw it coming.The fist connected with his jaw, rocking his head, and he stumbled back and fell to the concrete floor.He climbed back to his feet with the metallic tang of blood in his mouth, and said We have to find some kind of peace, Colonel.The future depends on it.You idiot.They arent people.They are godless monsters.A blight on the universe, and I wont rest until I see every last one of them killed.Cowards like you made our world an easy target, and I wont allow you to sacrifice the last of us just to satisfy your idiot ideals.It was around then Jack realized he was surrounded.Armed soldiers had moved in and closed a circle around him, leaving no avenue of escape.Youre a traitor, Jack.Not just to our cause or our people, but to the whole world.I trusted you.I believed in you, and you threw it away.For what?For them?Thats not good enough.Go rot in a cell until Im ready to choke you to death.Rough hands grabbed his arms and pinned them behind his back.Someone kicked the back of his legs and he fell to his knees.Kai already had his hands behind his head.I can kill them all,  he said, still speaking in the alien language.Escape, but kill no one,  Jack replied, more or less.What about you?This is how it has to be, he replied in English.A guard reached out to grab Kai and the alien reacted, his movements fast and fluid like a dancing flame.He grabbed the arm, twisted it and threw the guard into the others.With his other hand, he pulled his mask from inside his jacket and slid it over his face, then disappeared.Not precisely.It was more like someone painted the world on the skin of his uniform, a Wile E.  Coyote version of a cloaking device that was never the less effective.What in hell?the colonel shouted.Open fire!Before anyone could let loose a single round, Kai leapt high into the air, sprang off the ceiling and was gone.Lock down the Ark.No one enters or leaves until I have that fuckers head on a stake!Jack spat blood onto the floor.Youll never catch him.Well see about that, Colonel Galili said.He drew his handgun and pistol whipped Jack, returning him to the sweet darkness where there was no war at all.Chapter 47:  Hoosegow  All things considered, Jack didnt mind prison so much this time.Maybe it was the human prepared food, which he hadnt had the pleasure of in five months.Maybe it was because there were other prisoners in shouting distance, or moaning distance in many of their cases.Maybe it was the simple fact that he wasnt pinned to the ceiling like a defective light fixture, nor was he being tortured for information he didnt have.Maybe hed simply grown fond of enclosed spaces.Regardless of the reason, Jack considered his situation just peachy, and he resigned himself to sit back and wait for the Ark to be annihilated.His only wish was for a chance to see it all burn down before Galili choked the life out of him.There was a commotion at the end of the cell block, and two people in hooded ponchos came rushing down the aisle.Which cell?one of them asked.Sixty seven, the other said hurriedly.Their pounding feet echoed through the empty halls, and they came to a screeching halt in front of Jacks cell.Is that him?I dunno Theres an awful lot of beard in the way.Is this a jail break or improv night at the Chuckle Hut?Jack asked.Charlie lowered his hood, and then the five foot hoodlum beside him lowered hers as well, revealing Lisa Albrights glittering smile.Charlie spoke while he attached a small explosive to the cell door.Good to see you, bro.I thought for sure you were a goner.I didnt, Lisa said matter of factly, and added, Youre gonna want to get down.She and Charlie both ducked to the side.Jack ignored her, and blithely sat on his small bunk with his hands behind his head.The charge blew the lock seconds later, the blast pinpoint specific, producing little more than a few stray sparks and a puff of smoke.Charlie pulled the gate and it rumbled across the floor, while Lisa stood in the opening, waving for Jack to follow.Come on, hero.Times a wastin.He pushed himself up, stepped into the opening, took Lisa in his arms and kissed her hard.When he pulled away, she had a sour sort of smile on her face.You could use some mouth wash, she said.Sorry, he said.Been in prison.Second in so many months.Oral hygiene hasnt been a priority.Regardless, she said, nuzzling against his chest for a moment, Im glad to see you, too.Come on, love birds, Charlie chided.We need to get a move on before someone notices youre missing.Like Ive never done this before, Jack said, and the three took off at a swift pace.Charlie knew the inside of the rat maze like the back of his hand, and he led the way.He ducked in and out of shady corners and paused before every guard station, until they were clear of the detention district altogether.Then they threw caution to the wind and ran at break neck pace all the way back to the loading docks.Nikitin and Chase were waiting there in a four wheeler with the engine running.Ill be damned, Nikitin said.I will most surely be damned.Chase revved the engine and said, Yer a sight for sore eyes, boss.Jack smiled.Hed been sure he would never see those faces again, yet there they all were.They were more than friends; after all theyd been through together, they were his family.Even Charlie.The three jumped into the jeep, and Chase hit the gas.The wheels squealed, the vehicle lurched forward and it flew through the tunnel leading outside.To Jacks shock and dismay, the armored doors were gaping wide open.The man I was with, did they capture him?Nope, Charlie said.He made it out before they even got the doors closed, and they canceled the lockdown.Must be real fast, that one left two dozen dislocated shoulders behind him.Fast isnt even the half of it, Jack said, but his words were lost in the wind.The jeep raced out of the Ark and into the open night air, then slowed and trundled along the lightless roads.So, where to?Chase asked after a half klick.South, was all Jack said, and Chase took them Southward until the village thinned and disappeared behind them.After another half hour across the open steppe, the copse where Jack left Felix and the others came into view.Jack tapped Chase on the shoulder and said, Slow down when we get near that group of trees.Listen I know you folks have heard some rumors about me turning traitor, and throwing my hat in with the aliens.No worries, Charlie said.We wouldnt have busted you out if we believed a word of it, bro.
