"One little sandwich can't make that much diffecence. ""That little sandwich," John said, speaking for them all,  "contained the only piece of cheddar cheese inside four light years that could be used to make cheddite, with which we could save the galaxy.Do you realize what you have done?""Don't try to pass on the guilt to me," she snorted and fluffed her hair prettily with one hand."It was just some old cheese, and if we don't save the galaxy, then someone else will.Besides, it is late to do anything about it now. ""No, it's not," John said coldly, unlocking the medical kit from the wall."As a trained surgeon I can see one solution to our problem if we work quickly before the stomach acids.... ""No!"she screamed when she saw the rubber tubing, and she tried to run but was entangled at once by the many tentacles of Slug Togath, who held her immobile despite her struggles while the two Earthmen unshipped the stomach pump and went to work.Good taste forbids depicting what follows, but it suffices to say that a few hours later we find the Pleasantville Eagle winging its way toward the secret underground city of the Garnishee with Jerry at the controls under the guidance of Slug Togath who overflowed the copilot's seat.Everyone was happy, except Sally who, good little sport that she was, was not feeling too sporty this time, but a couple of miniatures of vodka on a very empty stomach had put her to sleep, and she was sleeping comfortably in the lounge.It was at this moment that John popped into the pilot's compartment waving a test tube joyfully."All done, guys.The particles of cheese have all been extracted and cleaned and are in this tube.We now have the raw material for a cheddite projector. ""Raw is the word for it," Jerry mused."How is Sally taking it all now?""The booze helped, and she is sacked out.But, my, what she called me before she dozed off.Where does a sweet little small town girl whose daddy is president of the college get a vocabulary like that?""Evil companions, I guess.All those grunts back from Nam with their grass and filthy language, lousing up our campuses.Though I heard a really good one from this guy.It seems.... ""Prepare to land," Slug Togath said sharply, turning his body so one of his long distance eyes could point straight ahead."We are almost to the secret entrance. ""Secret is the word," Jerry muttered awedly."There's nothing down there but sandy desert. ""Land now and taxi between those two mounds of rock," was the reply.He did as instructed, and no sooner had the massive form of the Pleasantville Eagle come to a halt than they felt a sudden dropping motion.The desert here was nothing but a great elevator that lowered them swiftly deep into the ground.As they dropped, they saw the camouflaged roof close over them, and they kept on going down, faster and faster.Finally, they braked to a stop as the immense elevator dropped them into an immense cavern studded with lights above and filled with incomprehensible machinery."Ten thousand years ago our forefathers brought forth under this land a refuge for our civilization," Slug Togath intoned proudly."While the endless war was fought on the surface, down here in the darkness we preserved our cultural heritage.All our resources since that time have been spent in fighting the war, our industry producing only war machines, our mothers producing only warriors.But we have not forgotten.When our warriors become too old and shot up to fight, many of them retire here and work until they die, preserving this vital heritage.Dusting the books, polishing the glass, that kind of thing. "It was impressive beyond all comprehension.Giant machines of incomprehensible function rose up until they grew dim above.Great wheels, gears, glass envelopes containing incredible devices of unknown operation.And more and more of this, all separated by shelf after shelf of books printed on imperishable sheets of eternium metal."Do you have a particle accelerator down here?"Jerry asked."Let me consult with the head caretaker," Slug Togath responded and approached an elderly Garnishee, whose tentacles were all gray and who wore eyepatches on at least half the eyes around his gnarled trunk.This individual waved his tentacles creakily in agreement and led the way down a broad corridor between the exhibits.Though they walked fast, it was a good half hour and they were feeling really pooped before they reached the device in question.Jerry and John took turns carrying Sally, and they were both staggering with exhaustion when they arrived and dropped onto the nearest bench."Though we are both crack athletes and in topnotch shape," Jerry said, "there is just one thing.Though we have had a good deal of water to drink, we have had no food, other than a mouthful of grass, in the past week.Sally is in the same shape, although she has at least seen a sandwich go by twice.So the big question is  is there anything we can eat?""There might be  but we must be very wary," SlugTogath responded with trepidation."Our proteins may be poison for you, and so forth.I suggest we take samples of your blood, sputum and krakkis "  "Krakkis?"Jerry asked."Well, not krakkis maybe.I guess maybe only we Garnishee have krakkis.Let's have the other samples, and our topnotch scientists will bring you a report within minutes. "Not only did they bring a report within minutes but something even better: a wheeled table covered with a shining metal dome."Congratulations!"Slug Togath reported."Your vital fluids, other than your krakkis, check out to ten decimal points identical with those of the Garnishee.So what we eat you can eat, though you may not like it. ""What do you eat?"John asked, sniffing the air strongly."A simple peasant meal," Slug Togath said, whipping the metal cover off the table."Of prifl, torkootchy and korpsk," he intoned, pointing to a thick, medium rare steak, baked potato, and black eyed peas."I'll have a large prifl with torkootchy," Jerry said, seizing a long tined fork."And maybe the korpsk on the side. "He had to move fast to dodge the flying cutlery of his shipmates, and within seconds they were tucking into the banquet and stuffing themselves with yumms and mmmms of approval."My regards to the cook," Jerry mumbled without stopping chewing."He does a great steak. ""He'll be glad to hear that," Slug Togath rumbled pleasurably."We have been pretty much vegetarians for years because the war used up most of the Ormoloo, but things are better now.We got a lot of chops and steaks out of the last battle. "The three Earthlings stopped eating for a moment and their eyes bulged as they realized they were eating their former allies, then enemies, now reduced back to their normal role of meat animals."It's as if we were fighting a war against Angus cows," Jerry explained, speaking for them all."We wouldn't let all those steaks go to waste just because they were the enemy.And you know what happens to a bull after a bullfight. "Thus reassured, they dived in with a will and cleaned their plates under the benevolent and multiple eyes of their host.When the last scrap of food had been consumed, both John and Sally crapped out on the spot and began to snore.But not so Jerry, who knew his duty to rescue his comrade, so he staggered to his feet; besides, he had to find the head.It proved to be an interesting cubicle, and he couldn't figure out how anything really worked, but he did his best and emerged ready for work.In a matter of minutes the particle accelerator was fired up and calibrated and the ball of cheddar underwent the barrage that transformed it into a new form of matter.Jerry spared time for only one jubilant gaze before rushing to construct the necessary circuitry to activate the cheddite to generate the kappa radiation.Here the eons old genius of the Garnishee came into play, and he was shown how to operate an incredible machine that constructed other machines from an outline of their functions drawn on a screen.In a matter of seconds it delivered a stronger, yet miniaturized version of the original cheddite projector  no bigger than an Earth flashlight.In fact, it looked very much like a five cell flashlight with the cheddite mounted in the evacuated chamber with a glass cover just where the bulb would normally be.It could be mounted in delicate gimbals for distant work and could also be used as a hand weapon whisking anything it was pointed at into the lambda dimension, then depositing the whisked away object one hundred feet above the surface of the nearby sun.A potent weapon indeed.The other two awoke, groaning, to a demonstration of the device."That's half the game. "John eructated."Now the Pleasantville Eagle must be prepared as a space vessel to continue the chase. ""Some work while others sleep!"Jerry chuckled."Just come and look what the incredible Garnishee have done with their eons old knowledge. "He led the way back to their plane, which looked superficially the same, though it had been polished to a high gloss.However, major changes had been made in the interior, not all of which were always visible to the naked eye."First off," explained Jerry, "the space between the inner and outer skin of the plane has been filled with insulite, which is a better insulater than a vacuum, I have been told.All the exterior windows are of transparent armolite, which is clear as glass and as strong as steel.We won't need oxygen for the engines, though there is now a supply for ourselves, since the fuel tanks are filled with combustite, a fuel a thousand times more powerful than our ordinary jet fuel and which does not need oxygen to burn.This is also used for powerful jets under the tail that may come in handy someday.All batteries have been replaced with ones made of Garnishee capacitite which seem to have unlimited capacity for storing electrical energy.Back here the galley has been expanded into a complete kitchen with hibachi and radar oven, and beyond it a frozen food locker that could feed us for five years if need be.Farther back is a completely outfitted laboratory and machine shop with stockpiles of raw ingredients.In this locker are extra powerful spacesuits, each almost a small spaceship in itself, one for each of us and  gosh, I hope he uses it one for Chuck as well. "He hurried on so they would not hear the huskiness in his voice, but they heard it nevertheless and understood."Up here on top, the flight deck has been expanded right back to take over the entire first class lounge; the bar's a deck below now, to hold all the new equipment and controls.This chair here is for the gunner because remote controlled gun turrets have been installed in twelve positions and armed with rapid fire weapons firing pellets filled with destructite, an explosive a thousand times more powerful than gunpowder. "He went on to point out the various controls and other devices far too numerous to mention, though he promised to later, but he did point out and take pride in one set of controls that filled an entire end of the compartment  "I don't know if we will ever need this," he opined, "but the old Eagle has been equipped with a space drive, the same kind that the Lortonoi and everyone else in the galaxy use, the only kind of space drive that cut the mustard until the cheddite projector came down the pike and knocked it into a cocked hat It's called a space warper. ""How does it work?"John queried."By warping space.There is a great projector source which projects a beam of energy through a disk of warpite.This produces a new form of radiation that emerges in the form of warpicles, not wavicles, and is sent blasting through space ahead of the ship.What it does is reach out and seize the very fabric of space itself and pull it toward the ship until there is a great bulge in space flattened out before the ship, which then flies through it as the warp is released so that it emerges on the far side of the bulge, which is maybe a light year or so ahead.Clear?""Clear!"John articulated."I wish I had a bit of what you been smoking. ""All right, no need to get shirty; let me give you the example that the Garnishee gave me.Imagine your spaceship as being a needle lying on a rug  you with me so far?""The sarcasm we can live without," John huffed."Get on with it. ""Roger.So, the warpicles reach out and pull on space the rug now  and pull it toward the needle so that a great big bulge of rug is pulled up in front of the needle.Then the needle is pushed through just two thicknesses of rug, and the bulge is pulled flat, and zip!the needle is now a couple of feet away though it only went through two thicknesses of the rug.Simple.You can understand, can't you, Sally?""Sure, easy.Do the Garnishee have nice rugs?""I hope it works like you say"  John frowned dubiously  "because if it doesn't, we are in for a really rough ride. ""Well, we are just using it as a backup device.We depend upon the cheddite projector for most of the traveling. ""Weare here," Slug Togath announced, coming into the plane with fifty other Garnishee right behind him."Who are we?"Jerry queried surprisedly."Myself and fifty volunteers.I have taken a leave of absence from my work as prime minister and will accompany you with these bravest of the brave.Though every able bodied Garnishee is needed to rebuild the wreckage of our ruined world, we also have a responsibility to the intelligent life in the universe.You have relieved us of the burden of the Lortonoi and ended the millennia old war, and we feel that we can do no less for the other races of the galaxy who are oppressed by that bloodthirsty and despicable race of mental leeches. ""Well and nobly said," John concurred."Not only that," Slug Togath continued."We also hate the bastards with a hatred beyond understanding and would greatly like to be in on the kill when they are smeared, bombed, and destroyed. ""Even better reason. "Jerry nodded."They deserve no mercy.We welcome you and your intrepid followers aboard, please tell them to come well armed and bring plenty of ammo, and it will be a pleasure to fight side by side with them in this just war to save the galaxy. ""Let's drink to that," Sally said smilingly as she came down the aisle pushing the bar cart."To an alliance for victory.Death to the Lortonoi!""Death to the Lortonoi!"they cried with one voice and raised their glasses and downed them.That is, the humans drained their glasses.The Garnishee emptied their miniatures of booze into the plastic glasses which they discarded, then ate the bottles since glass acts like an intoxicant with this ancient race.The engines thundered to life, and the magnificent crusade began.11  ENCOUNTER IN DEEP SPACE  Like an arrow hurled from the strongest bow, the refurbished Pleasantville Eagle shot into the air, tearing a crackling hole through the atmosphere at twice the speed of sound.The two Earthmen were at the controls while the tentacled, trunklike forms of the Garnishee were at the other stations.Slug Togath stood behind the pilots where he could coordinate the operation.Sally, very much the hostess in her cheerleader's uniform, was in the aft cabin serving steak sandwiches and drinks to the rows of Garnishee seated there, at the same time complaining bitterly over this menial task.The mighty Garnishee warriors sat unmoving in rapt fascination, listening to the taped jazz program over the headphones at each seat and watching the movie.There was no main feature, but they did not seem to mind, for they took an immense interest in the football training films which they thought were depicting a weird pagan ritual, which perhaps they were.Once they were on top of the atmosphere and the stars above burned with a cold unffickering light like moth holes in a blanket, Slug Togath leaned forward and pointed at one of them, a blue point in the eternal darkness."There," he said, "is the star to which we have tracked the fleeing Lortonoi spaceship with our omicron radar which detects the action of a space warper.They fled in that direction, but whether they stayed in the vicinity of that star, known to us as Krshtenvlemntu krm, we do not know. ""Well, we can find out when we get there," said Jerry, adjusting the cheddite projector controls."And unless I'm wrong, I believe that is the star we call Spica, so let's call it Spica, huh, because it is a lot easier to say. "Since Jerry was the commander, Slug Togath begrudgingly agreed  but deep down inside he knew it would always be Krshtenvlemntu krm to him."Until we get the bugs worked out of the new cheddite projector, I'm going to take it real easy," Jerry said, adjusting the controls with total absorption."We'll just jump ahead a teeny bit, maybe just ten light years and see how we make out. "Everything twitched, and they were ten light years nearer to Spica, which shone much more brightly now.Corrections were made, and they jumped again.And again.Each time closer, until, after careful and exacting measurements, a final jump was made that would bring them just outside the orbit of the outermost planet that circled this brilliant sun.The jump was made, and instantly every alarm, buzzer, bell, and siren went wild inside the Pleasantville Eagle.They had emerged at the edge of a furious space battle.While Jerry took evasion maneuvers and zipped out of range, the others looked on wide eyed  and that is a lot of wide eyes since the Garnishee had about twenty three each  at the fierce engagement that was being played out against the backdrop of stars for their edification.It was an unequal battle, three to one, but the pilot of the single black ship was a master of his craft.No matter how hard they tried, the three pursuing white spacers could not manage to nail the black one which twisted, darted, and dodged with incredible dexterity.Torpedoes flashed out and missed, while snarling, ravening rays of destruction flicked close  but never close enough to touch the pursued."I take my hat off to that pilot," John said with admiration, "he really is a crackerjack. ""But," Jerry inquired, "which side is which?""That is a good question," Slug Togath intoned."Undoubtedly one side or the other are allies of the Lortonoi who fled this way.Let us contact them on the radio and ask. "This was attempted, but with very little success.There was the hiss and crackle of solar static from the great blue sun and some distant, incomprehensible chatter on the communication bands, nothing else."No dice there"  Jerry shrugged  "but I have a better idea.If the Lortonoi are at all involved in that bruhaha out there then there will be some mind reading, mind control, that sort of thing going on because we know they are big for that stuff.So here's what.John, you take the controls.Slug Togath get behind me and give me a good wrapping with your tentacles, so I can't do any harm.Then take off my mind shield, and I'll try to contact those ships and see who is who so we can come to the aid of the good guys, if there are any.If I get too raunchy or like that, you can put the mind shield back on me and snap me out of it. ""You are a brave man indeed, comrade," Slug Togath rapped out as he enwrapped Jerry in his unbreakable embrace."Now prepare yourself, for I remove the mind shield. "And he did so, dexterously, with a quick flip of his last tentacle."Nothing yet," Jerry said grimly."I'll just send out a message and see what happens.Hello, warring spaceships, can you read me?I am enemy of the Lortonoi and ready to aid all enemies of those evil minded leeches.Are any of you there on the same side?"Suddenly Jerry twitched all over and writhed a bit, then became calm.When he spoke again, it was in a completely different voice, an alien one in fact."Very pleased to meet you all, I'm sure.You might say you chaps have come in the old nick of time.Bit of a job keeping these rascals at bay  ooops!touch of the death ray there bit a chunk out of my tail.If you would like to lend a hand, you could shoot up the three bandits back there who are giving me a hard time. ""Who are you?"John asked."Sorry, should have introduced myself.I am Lord Prrsi of the Hagg Inder, and look, chaps, could we save the rest of the intros for later?There just went one of my stern tubes. "They could see the space battle becoming fiercer with every passing instant."That's OK," John told him."But we have to have something other than your word that you are on our side.We want to contact the three ships that are attacking you. ""Perfectly reasonable request under the circumstances.Look, I'll switch this call to one of the Hagg Loos in the bandits on my tail.You chat with them and let me know what they say.Over and out. "Instantly a dreadful change came over Jerry.He writhed in the implacable embrace of the Garnishee while his face twisted with incredible fury and from his lips burst a filthy torrent of abuse."Tentacled soft limbed scum of the universe, how dare you invade holy space of Hagg Loos, filthy democratic republican perverts, we allies of peace loving Lortonoi will destroy "  "Enough of that," Slug Togath said, slapping the mind shield back on Jerry's skull."Seems pretty obvious. ""Seems even more obvious if you have one of those repulsive creatures stamping through your gray matter," Jerry grated, aligning the cheddite projector in its weapon mode and quickly pressing the activator button three times.On the instant the three enemy spacers vanished and reappeared just above the surface of the burning hot blue sun, and we pretty well know what happened to them then.Jerry took off the mind shield again and instantly spoke in the rounded tones of Lord Prrsi."I say, that is a neat way of letting me know what they said to you.Whisk  and they're gone.You must show me that trick.Listen, we ought to have this conversation at closer quarters.That is oxygen you're breathing?I thought so, real wizard.Why don't we just match velocity, and I'll join you in your ship.Airlock to airlock, you know the old bit. "As the two voyagers of the space lanes drew close all aboard the Pleasantville Eagle could see that Lord Prrsi's ship had not come through the battle unscathed.It was a black dart, almost as long as the 747, but much thinner and without wings.Here and there the skin was seared as though by a blast of heat, and pieces had been bitten out of various parts there and here.Yet the pilot was still smoothly in control and eased up under their wing, and there was only the slightest bump as the newcomer sealed against their newly built airlock.Jerry set the automatic pilot, and they all went back to the cabin to welcome the valiant fighter.There was the hissing of air and a great thumping whumping within the lock, and then, finally, the inner door opened, and the pilot started to come in.Sally screamed and screamed again, and some of the others felt like joining her.Lord Prrsi, for all his calm and civilized voice when he had spoken through Jerry's body, was a monster.Imagine if you can a twenty foot long coal black chitin armored, barb tailed, and claw rattling scorpion.If you can imagine that, you will have about half an idea of what this alien life form looked like.Not only that, but he was hot."Rather cold in here," the creature said with a nasal voice."But I can bear it for a bit.Whom might I have the pleasure?"It turned to face them now, and they realized it had backed into the cabin.Two fiercely glowing red eyes burned down at them from the hideous black head, one of the eyes swollen and distorted by a circular lens the size of a manhole lid that was bolted to supports drilled in the creature's impervious hide.Jerry, no coward he, stepped forward and introduced them all."My pleasure," the creature murmured and adjusted the lens before its eye to look at them better."You speak pretty good English for a thing that's hot as a brick kiln and looks like a twenty foot long black scorpion," John spoke up bravely."How nice of you to say that," Lord Prrsi said."If truth be known, I rather pride myself on my linguistic ability; in fact, I led the movement to adopt this new language in place of our old one which was just too clumsy for civilized use.You see we have powerful radio receivers, and we picked up broadcasts from an insignificant little yellow star out in that direction. "He waved a great clattering claw."Oh, I say, I am sorry.Should have realized.It is rather a nice star, for a yellow one, I mean.Since you speak the language, I may assume you come from there?Yes, thought so.Dreadfully rude of me.But I wander.In any case we heard this language emanating from a country named BBC Third Program, and it seemed to fit our needs so we adopted it. ""Could we offer you some refreshment?"Sally asked, ever the perfect little hostess."How exceedingly kind of you.I could do with a glass of water if it is not too much trouble.I had a drink of water about four months ago, and I'm sure I will be needing more soon so, why not be piggy, have one now, a celebration and all that.Thank you very much, such a big one!Enough for five of my people.Well, cheers. "He drained the glass in an instant, then wiped his mouth orifice with a clattering, razor edged claw."Could you tell us something about what is happening on your planet and why the fighting and all that?"Jerry asked."Indeed I can, and a dreadful story it is.It goes back a long time, and if I bore you, please speak up.My race is called the Haggis, and we evolved on the third planet of the sun you see out there.The planet is also called Haggis, which, I suppose, is where our name comes from.In any case the sun is rather bright and hot, and the surface temperature of Haggis is above the boiling point of water over most of the surface, which is one of the reasons why we value this precious fluid so.But I digress.It seems that the incredible burning radiation of the sun produced mutations at a galloping rate, and my people, the Hagg Inder, developed black chitin to shield us from the sun's rays.But here the race divided, and a subrace, that calls itself the Hagg Loos in their degenerate tongue, stayed white.Now, aside from the fact that black is beautiful "  "Keep the faith, baby," John said.   "it is also good for blocking off radiation.But the white is transparent to the radiation so that the Hagg Loos had their brains almost cooked out of their sockets after a while.This has produced a race that I can say, without exaggeration, is nuttier than a goober farm.They are insane, evil, degenerate, deprived, depraved, destructful, and desultory.We fought them, but they breed like rabbits in the spring, so in self defense, we Hagg Inder emigrated to the fourth planet to get away from them.But they enjoy an evil genius and developed space travel as well, so that a space war has now been going on for over nine thousand years. ""Our war lasted over ten thousand," Slug Togath said offhandedly."How very nice for you," Lord Prrsi intoned cuttingly."Not to interrupt, but I was saying that right bang in the middle of this war the loathsome Lortonoi arrived and were received by the Hagg Loos with open claws.They really are made for each other, vying for bottom in a loathsomeness contest one might say.They are the only race that has ever willingly joined forces with these interstellar brain leaches.The war intensified then and has been going on at a great rate ever since, and that is about all there is to tell.We trade information with other intelligent, moral, class ridden societies like our own who fight the Lortonoi, and we can just about hold our own with the new weapons and all that sort of thing.But I talk too much and must be boring you!Please tell me what brings you to our neck of the galaxy, but first, excuse my beastly manners in not mentioning it earlier, but please accept my heartiest thanks for pulling me out of that fix.I bear important messages for our king which I know he will appreciate having. ""Our pleasure," Jerry said."Our history, in ways, is much like yours.We do come from that yellow sun you mentioned, which we call Sun, and our friends here are from Proxima Centauri back there a ways.We have joined together to do what we can to wipe out the degenerate Lortonoi "  "Hear!Hear!"" and to rescue our friend, Chuck van Chider, who has been captured by them. ""Oh, I say, hard cheese.Captives don't last long with that lot.Even if they mean to hold onto them for a bit, they forget, temptation for a bit of torture creeps up on them until bingo!chap's got no skin or an earful of molten lead, you know the sort of thing.And even if prisoners live for a bit, they turn them over to the Hagg Loos to work in the incredible DnDrf mines at the North Pole, from out of which no one ever emerges alive. "Sally screamed and fainted."We will go after Chuck and rescue him no matter where he is," Jerry said with grim certitude, and all the others nodded agreement, except Sally, who was still unconscious on the floor."Well spoken, chaps.Why don't we go back and meet the king and that sort of thing, and perhaps you can tell him about the new weapon, dashed effective I must say, and we'll see what we can find out about your friend?"Lord Prrsi left then, in somewhat of a hurry since he was beginning to feel the chill, which the others didn't mind since they all were beginning to sweat profusely.The long black ship led the way and signaled ahead so they would not be shot down, and soon they were dropping down toward an immense fortress in the midst of a shellpocked plane.It was a giant, brooding metal construction that bristled with great gun turrets and detection equipment which tracked their descent.Only at the very last moment did a giant hatch snap open so they could fly in.They did this quickly, as they had been instructed, and the multitonned portal closed on the instant  and just in time  as torpedoes lashed down from space and exploded harmlessly against its invulnerable surface.Lord Prrsi was waiting at the foot of the gangway to meet them when they emerged."Welcome to our planet," he said."I have issued orders that the passageways you will use, as well as the throne room, be lowered in temperature for your convenience.I hope you won't think us rude if we wear these heaters, such as the one hanging from my poison barbed tail. ""Yes, thanks," Jerry said while perspiration burst from his every pore.If this was the "lowered" temperature, he hesitated to think what the heat was normally like in here.Stumbling and sweating, they followed their guide to a great room adorned with stained glass windows and trophies, desiccated white poison barbs undoubtedly from the enemy Hagg Loos, as well as a dais with a wide golden throne upon it.Upon the throne, wearing a golden crown and a golden space heater on his tail, lay an impressive Hagg Inder who must be the king."May I introduce the king," Lord Prrsi intoned, and they all joined him in bowing low before the majesty upon the throne."Oh, I say, do rise, enough of that protocol and poppycock.Welcome to our fair planet, and what is this I hear about an invincible weapon you have?"He leaned forward and rubbed two great claws together with a rasping sound."It's not exactly a weapon," Jerry explained in detail."It's really a spaceship drive that can be used as a weapon, like I did with those Hagg Loos ships.I used the space drive to transport them to the surface of your sun. ""Utterly charming, do go on. ""That's about all there is to it.Except we only have the one cheddite projector, and there is a second one, but the Lortonoi stole it and escaped here, and that is why we followed them to try and get it back, and our friend Chuck as well, whom they kidnapped at the same time. ""The Lortonoi have this weapon!"the king gasped and, at the same time, inadvertently closed his claw and snipped in half a six inch steel bar with which he had been toying."That could be messy.Lord Prrsi, you know our spy, what's his name, charming fellow but of course too pale.Get him on the secret wavelength and find out if he knows anything about all this. "Lord Prrsi clacked his claws in salute and scuttled out."This spy is a most amusing person," the king said bemusedly as he snipped the steel rod into tiny chunks."Born an albino, freak of nature and all that, dreadfully hard on his family.But he went to a good school and learned to fight quite well with all the sneers about color and such.Then someone had the delightful idea of surgically implanting an eternium metal case around his brain to shield it from radiation and shipping him off to Haggis as a spy.Worked like a charm.The sodding Hagg Loos are so insane that anyone with a spark of talent can rise to the top.Our fellow, from a good family and all that, soon rose in the ranks, and now, I do believe, he is the head of their intelligence department or security or something like that.Ahh, my dear Prrsi, that was quick.And your report?""Some good news and some bad news, your Highness.First the good.The Lortonoi are in the secret underground laboratory on Haggis and are very annoyed because the Hagg Loos scientists, mad as hatters all of them, have not yet licked the problem of how to control the cheddite projector.So we won't have to worry about their turning the thing on us for a while.And now the bad news.Your companion, Chuck was the name I believe, would not aid them in their work, and after the usual physical and mental torture they shipped him off to the DnDrf mines, from which there is no return. ""We will save him!"cried Jerry."Abandon all hope, it cannot be done. ""I will do it!""Well  it might be done, but there is only one way.Someone must volunteer to be sold into slavery and be sent to the mine to lead the prisoners in revolt to coincide with an attack from the outside.Any of you chaps want to volunteer for slavery and probably certain death?"There was a quick shuffling backward by everyone in the room.Slow seconds passed, and guilty looks flashed from under lowered lids.In the end there was one hesitant shuffling footstep after another as Jerry dragged himself reluctantly forward."Call up the slavers!"he said, chin up and arms folded staunchly before him."I volunteer. "A spontaneous cheer ran around the room, and Sally grabbed and kissed him moistly.12  DISASTER AT THE MINE  "If I'm going through with this scheme I've got to have a lot more info than I have now," Jerry sweated, wiping his forehead with a sweep of his hand."What is this DnDrf stuff they are mining?""Terrible!"Lord Prrsi said, shivering at the thought, and all the other Hagg Inder quivered as well and, let me tell you, until you have seen a room full of red hot, quivering, twenty foot iong black scorpions, you have seen nothing."It is a drug one sniff of which will render the sniffer an addict for life.And an addict will do anything to keep the supply coming until, after a few years, the chitin turns to powder and the suffering creature is finally released from the terrible bondage. ""What if you don't have chitin?"John asked, interested."What's chitin?"Sally whispered."I thought it was something you ate. ""That's chitlin," John whispered back."Chitin is the hard outer covering of most insects and aliens like the Haggis here. ""Any time you are through whispering I'll be happy to answer your question," Lord Prrsi said, and twitched his great poison sting with annoyance."The answer is if you don't have chitin, then you are immune to the drug effects of DnDrf.Which is why the cold, soft fleshed races like yours are sent to the mines.The interstellar slave traders always drop by here knowing they can get a good price for their cargo.And by jingo!there's the answer to your problem of how to get into the mine!Grab the next slave trader that comes along and get sold to him.I would ask for one hundred credits but don't settle for a penny less than eighty five. ""I do believe a slave trader will be calling in here," the king broke in."A wonderful idea.And if you could stop the DnDrf trade, we would be ever so grateful. ""If there is a slave trader here," SaIly said, putting her pretty little mind to work, "then that means  gasp!you keep slaves!""Well, not too many," the king said with a certain amount of guilt oozing out between his words."We treat them well and that sort of thing, and it does keep the working classes quiet since they miss the worst jobs. "SaIly turned her back, folded her arms, sniffed loudly, and said no more.Lord Prrsi was leafing through a sheaf of thin metal sheets marked with strange calligraphy."Yes, by Jove!"he elated."Here's one of the bods just took off this morning.Slow tubs, you know, you can catch him up easily in your ship and flog Jerry to him for a decent price.They'll buy him, then sell him to the HaggLoos who will instantly pop him through the one way door of the DnDrf mine and that is that."How will we get out?"Jerry asked."That is a bit of a problem.Any plans you make with the others will be heard instantly by the mind reading villains.Of course you could take in a batch of miniaturized mind shields; we have some nice ones. "They were indeed nice, no bigger than the head of a pin.Yet when one of them was breathed up a nostril and lodged in a sinus cavity it would go instantly to work, activated by the moisture and the warmth, and provide as good a mind shield as the bulky caps supplied by the Garnishee.A supply was provided and woven into Jerry's jockstrap, the theory being that if they took away his clothes and shoes, they would at least leave him that.The Hagg Loos may have been insane monsters, but they wouldn't go that far.Then Jerry's clothes were torn and whip marks painted on his skin, and they all returned to the delicious cool of the Pleasantville Eagle and shot off after the slavers.It was only a matter of minutes before they caught up with them in their parabola course that took their ship well outside the battle zone.John pulled up alongside the rusty, streaked, stained, filthy vessel and called them on the radio."Hello, slave ship, do you read me?""We prefer to be called Employment Counselors," came the whining answer in reply."We have an employee here maybe we can bring to you for counseling. ""A slave for sale?"came the slobbering answer."State the specifications. ""Male, strong, stupid, loves obeying orders, lowtemperature life form suitable for the DnDrf mines.I want a hundred credits for it. ""You'll take eighty five or you'll take nothing. ""Eighty five it is.Match airlocks and we'll pass him over.See that the money is passed back in its place. ""We are honest businessmen performing a vital function in society and would never consider cheating on a legitimate transaction of this kind.Besides, we see your gun turrets. "Shoulders back, back straight, Jerry walked into the airlock and heard the heavy inner door close behind him like the sealing of a vault.
