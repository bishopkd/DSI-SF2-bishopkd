Ive said it once and Ill say it again: its not the bars that break you, its the patches of sky in between.When you think youre finally free of your particular prison, only to discover that, actually, youre in an even worse place than you were before.When we escaped from the Island, when Lena and me were bobbing away over to the Mainland on that barely buoyant wooden doorwith Jimmy, Delilah and the kids a little ways up ahead, lost in that great rag tag flotilla of Detainees and floating junkI swear, I never been happier in my life.Why wouldnt I be?After all those years of being stuck out on that pile of crap, at last I was free.I had the woman I waited all my life for beside me (who, and you probably aint gonna believe me, reckons she loves me every bit as much as I love her) and now we could go wherever we wanted.In fact, all around us there was this huge tidal wave of joy and optimism as thousands of Detainees paddled, sailed or merely swam that mile or so back over to the Mainland.Time and time again defiant cries echoed out into the starry night, skipping across the water, letting those in the City know we were on our way back.Occasionally thered even be some singing, laughterdammit, if it hadnt been for the fact that we were in water, I reckon we mightve formed a conga line and danced our way across.Old folks and kids, away from that terrible placethe stench, the filth, the casual and constant violence, the Wastelordsoff to find a better life.But it didnt last for long.In fact, it was over almost before itd begun.I keep thinking about that expression: out of the frying pan and into the fire, though that dont exactly do the situation justice.Even before we got ashore, I knew something was terribly wrong.The thing is, I wasnt just escaping, I was going home.The city where I lived for over fifty years, the city that, though I never cared to admit it, I used to look longingly at from the Island almost every day.But the closer we got, the less familiar it seemed.Nor was my unease helped by the fact that I could see several of the satellites Jimmy had reprogrammed to destroy each other looked to have started fires that seemed to benot just bursting into flames, but more erupting.Opposite me, holding on to the other side of the door, her hair hanging in wet tresses, Lena listened for a moment, her sightless hazel eyes reflecting the Citys unnatural glow.Whats going on?she asked.Satellites, I replied, keeping my voice as nonchalant as I could.Started a couple of fires.A quizzical frown formed on her face.Sounds loud.I leaned over.As I gave her a supportive hug, the door momentarily slipped below the water under my weight.She was doing her best, but I knew what a challenge it had to be.To leave somewhere shed been so familiar with, where she could see almost as well as a sighted person, to go to a place where she didnt know one solitary step.I mean, I havent said anything to her, course I havent, but if she cant cope, then screw a new life, screw freedom, screw everything.Ill go back and live on that damn island with her.Well fix it up somehow.Just echoing amongst the buildings, I guess, I reassured her.And yet there was something about the way those fires were burning, the flames leaping into the night, that felt almost appropriate: as if they were issuing a warning, telling us to keep away, and again I cursed myself for not having found us a proper boat, big enough for all seven of usfour adults and three kids.We couldve gone around the headland and landed somewhere up the coast, away from all this.There was a large swell, the sea bucked and broke and for a few moments I lost sight of the land.As it came back into view, another fire glimmered into life further around the bay, in one of the residential areas up in the hills.Was this really all down to satellites, or was it something else?Whats wrong, Clancy?Lena asked.Nothing, I told her, doing my best to keep up the enthusiasm that had propelled us away from the Island.She ignored my reassurances, also levering herself up on the door, sniffing the air as if it could give her a better idea of what we were approaching.Theres a smell, she said, slipping back into the water.What sort of smell?I dont know.Not nice.I didnt say any more, just concentrated on kicking my feet, maintaining the same steady, slow progress as everyone else around us.The subject I was doing my best to avoid, but in truth had been nagging at me ever since I saw those burning satellites plummeting down from the sky, was how people were going to respond.Without satellites to punish us, there was nothing: no cops, no judicial system, no rules or regulationsno judgment of right or wrong.All we ever hadall we ever needed as far as the authorities were concernedwas satellite policing.In the matter of a few spectacular minutes all law and order had disappeared and I didnt know how people were gonna react.In fact, tell the truth, I wasnt even sure how I was gonna react.I tried to speed up our progress, kicking a little harder, but we immediately collided with this old couple rolling back and forth on a water barrel.I apologized, gave them a shove, my legs starting to protest at this unfamiliar exercise.I aint any kind of swimmer, not with this bulk, all my energy goes into keeping me afloat, but I needed to get ashore and find out what was going on.I dont know how you can tell if buildings are friendly or not, but as the long, jagged bottom jaw of the City began to loom over us, I got the distinct impression that these werentjust an endless row of preformed concrete, each gravestone slab a statement for a different commercial concern, and dominating them all, like some huge black mausoleum, was the new Infinity building.That is one helluvan intimidating construction.Even from the Island we were aware of its day to day progress, how it grew and grew, but up close its something else.It looks more like a fort or prison.Theres no access on the ocean side, just rows and rows of windows on the upper floors, while on the very top sits its golden crown: that squinting two eyed symbol of theirs.Talk about appropriate.I know theyre supposed to be media, but that dont mean we want them spying on us all the time.And anyways, supposed to be is right.Those Infinity Specials who came over to help the Wastelords search for us on the Island didnt look like security personnel to me, more like something closer to military.We reached that point where the oceans swell flipped over into waves and our wooden crates and boxes, the sealed drums and even the occasional small boat started to bump into each other.Fortunately, at that same moment, my feet touched the bottom.I took Lenas hand, warned her about the rapidly growing chaos in front of us and began to splash through young and old celebrating at having made it across.They were all whooping it up, hugging each other, congratulating everyone within earshot, high fiving and shaking hands.Up ahead, dotted around the beach, I could see several small groups of seated Mainlanders, probably wondering what the hell was going on, where this endless line of flotsam and jetsam was coming from.Though there didnt seem to be much in the way of a reaction: as the first dripping Detainees waded ashore, collapsing onto the sand, they just stayed where they were, in anonymous huddles, barely even glancing our way.Finally Lena and me managed to weave our way through everyone and everything, splashing up onto the litter strewn urban beach, the only injury a bruised shin I collected from a plank tossed at me by a wave.Big Guy!shouted a familiar voice, and I turned to see Jimmy pegging his way over; Delilah and the kidsGordie, Arturo and Hannafollowing on behind.You okay?Fine, I said, turning to Lena, who promptly gave an encouraging smile.Wow!Can you believe it?Jimmy marveled, gaping around at the City, shaking his head, his straggly old scrap of a ponytail, the only hair on an otherwise bald head, flapping from side to side.How cool is this?I nodded, doing my best to shelve my concerns, more surprised than reassured by how quiet it was.What dya think, kids?All three of them stared at the towering buildings in front of us.Hanna, as ever, wordless, Gordie shrugging his usual indifference, while Arturo was plainly more impressed.Can we live up there?he asked, pointing to the very top of a tower.I shook my head.Nope.Were getting out of this place as fast as our legs can carry us.I turned to Lena to fill her in on where Arturo wanted to live, but she was more interested in getting her own view of things by repeatedly sniffing the air, maybe still trying to identify that bad odor.A fire flared upsomewhere on the other side of the block, crackling away like the multiple breaking of branches, an orange glow bouncing off the wallsand she gave this little nod, as if shed been expecting it.Where is everyone?Gordie asked, as surprised as I was that our welcome committee consisted only of a few disinterested stragglers sitting on the beach.Good question.It was eerie.Apart from the occasional passing automatic bus, most of which seemed to be empty, the bay road was practically free of traffic.It didnt strike me so much as a ghost city, more a heavily preoccupied oneas if somewhere something big was going on.Thought we might have to fight our way up the beach, Delilah commented, putting her arm around little Arturo in case he needed her protection.Neither the little guy nor Hanna had ever known any life but the Island.Gordie lived on the Mainland for a while, but it was probably too long ago for him to clearly remember.As for Lena, she lived here til her early teens, but without sight now that probably wasnt a lot of use to her.Again I gave her a squeeze, our wet clothes so impregnated with the grime of the Island that they felt all cold and slippery, like fish.I was a little concerned I might be overdoing it, being too attentive, but I couldnt help but worry about her, especially with that confused little frown that kept tangling her brow.They say anything?I asked Jimmy, indicating the nearest group of Mainlanders, five or six of them sitting in a circle.Nah.Barely seemed to notice us.Delilah grunted.Addicts or alcoholics, she muttered, as if she knew such people all too well.They wouldnt know if we beamed down from Mars.Just at that moment, the fire on the other side of the block mustve found a new source of fuel cuz there was a sudden loud explosion and flames shot high enough in the air to appear over the rooftops.Several of the Detainees screamed and crouched down on their haunches, as if expecting the world to fall in on them, but as the flames subsided, they laughed nervously at their own behavior and got to their feet.I gave Lena another squeeze, told her it was all right, and just as I knew she would at some stage, she pulled away, going to talk the kids, as if shed had enough of me and my fussing.I turned to Jimmy, at last having the opportunity to voice my concerns.What the hells going on here?I muttered.Where is everybody?He shook his head, plainly every bit as worried as I was.Beats me.And it wasnt just us either.A lot of the Detainees had been determined to celebrate being backto kiss the ground, do a little dance, whateverbut slowly they were falling silent, as if no longer sure it was a cause for celebration.Most of them just stood there, gaping at the City as if expecting to see something terrible come out of it at any moment.Nor did it help when an automatic bus came into view engulfed by flames, still following its programmed route, still making its usual stops, but passing by like some disintegrating mobile beacon, with sparks and embers flying off into the night.Shit, Jimmy muttered.By now there was quite a crowd huddled all along that narrow strip of sand.The slower ones were still arriving, wading through the lazily somersaulting water, their eager smiles fading as they caught the general mood.Lets go, I said to the others.Again I caught that frown on Lenas face, but I insisted on leading her away, making sure Jimmy, Delilah and the kids were right behind, deliberately taking a route past the nearest group of Mainlanders, just to see what theyd do, if theyd give any indication of their attitude toward us.At first they didnt so much as glance our way, and I thought Delilah must be right, that they were so far out of it, nothing mattered.There was this woman sitting there with her outstretched partners head in her lapit kinda spooked meshe suddenly locked onto us, giving out with this squeal, pointing over.Immediately the others turned our way, also getting het up, starting this chorus of plaintive wailing.In that moment, the flames of the nearby fire exploded into the sky once more and I caught a glimpse of their faces.They looked like ghouls, pale and lifeless, their eyes so dark and recessed you could barely make out a pupil.I just kept on walking, pretending I hadnt noticed.Out of the corner of my eye I saw one guy trying to struggle up, apparently about to give chase, but he simply didnt have the strength.We left them howling away behind us, stretching out their arms, begging us to come back.What was that all about?Lena asked.I hesitated, still mindful of not adding to her concerns.Nothing.She paused for a moment, then gave this long irritated sigh.Clancy, if you dont stop this, Im heading off on my own.I didnt know what to do.No matter how concerned I was about her, I also knew she was more than capable of carrying out such a threat.Just a bunch of addicts with crap in their heads, thats all, I muttered.Like Delilah said.At that point, Jimmy came sidling over to me, positioning himself on the other side to Lena, making this face, gesturing back at the group.Behind us, I could hear Gordie and Arturo teasing Hanna, making these wailing sounds, circling around her, baring their teeth as if they were about to attack.Zombies!they kept chanting, though she just ignored them, walking on with this superior air, like you just got to expect that kind of crap from boys.I nodded at Jimmy, all the while mad at myself for communicating with him in a way Lena couldnt see.I also gave a slight sigh of relief that he, along with everyone else, hadnt spotted what I hadleastways, what I thought I had.That guy lying on the beach with his head on the womans lap, the only one who didnt reactthere was a good reason for that.He was dead.Those peopled had a corpse amongst them.And yet, the oddest thing of all was, the way they behaved, it was almost as if they thought we couldve saved him.Behind us, the other Detainees were starting to follow our example: splitting into groups, going only with those they trusted, dithering over which direction to take.Wed just about made it to the road and started to cross when I heard a chopper.I looked up, and there, wouldnt you know it, rising off the top of that massive dark edifice, was an Infinity Dragonfly.Shit!I groaned.I tugged Lena, and shouting to the others to follow, ran toward the far side of the road.Delilah was grumbling away somewhere at the back, asking why I was making such a fuss, until the chopper swooped down, lights blazing, buzzing over the heads of the Detainees.Stay where you are!Do not leave the beach!a female voice commanded.Do not leave the beach!Keep going!I told the others, scrambling over a low wall and ducking down behind.Leaving the Island is a Crime Against the State, the voice boomed.Do not leave the beach!There was a momentary stand off, the Dragonfly hovering menacingly, the Detainees looking at one another, wondering what to do.I mean, strictly speaking, it was a Crime Against the State, and til only a couple of hours ago, punishable by death from a satellite.But what the hell did that have to do with Infinity?They were supposed to report the news, not make it.Maybe the same thought struck the other Detaineesor maybe the prospect of freedom, so tantalizingly near, was just too much.Whatever, one group suddenly made a dash toward the road and the shelter of the buildings on the far side and immediately others followed.The Dragonfly wheeled in their direction, about to issue another warning, I thought, maybe intimidate them further by flying lower over their heads, but in fact, it opened up with its lasers.Noooo!Delilah screamed, and Hanna buried her face in her hands.I swear, if there was one moment when all our optimism, our hopes for a new life, came tumbling down, that was it.What the hell were they doing?What gave them the right?And they werent just stunning people either.They were blasting them to pieces.Everywhere you looked, Detainees young and old were getting cut down.People were screaming, running this way and that, some managing to escape into the City, others so panicked they just ran blindly back into the sea.The Dragonfly ceased firing and the woman again warned everyone not to leave the beach, this time mentioning something about emergency powers.Lets go, I told the others.Big Guy!Jimmy protested, fearing wed be spotted.Come on!I urged, glancing up, seeing another chopper leaving the Infinity roof.That was all the persuasion anyone needed.I took Lenas hand and began to run as fast as this hulking old frame was able, calling at the others to keep up.Where we went exactly, I dont know.It just became this crazy headlong dash down alleyways and through back streets, clinging to cover and shadows, desperate to get as far away as we could.At one point we turned a corner and came face to face with this huge blaze.I never seen anything like it, roaring and crackling away, not only sending flames several blocks into the air, but occasionally shooting them out horizontally, so they ignited other buildings.The heat was that intense, even from a hundred or more yards away, we had to back off and find another route.Nor was anyone doing anything about it.It had just been left to burn, to consume whatever it wanted.For sure there were no emergency vehicles around.I guess there were just too many fires and not enough resources.A couple of times, no matter how much we tried to avoid it, we literally ran into Mainlanders.The first group were like those on the beachpale, ghostly; we were gone before they could even reactwhile the others more or less ignored us.Amongst everything else that was going on, I guess we werent exactly a priority, just more patients loose in the asylum.After a while, especially for us oldies, pain and discomfort began to overwhelm adrenalin and we were forced to stop, gasping for breath, begging the old ticker to calm down.Jimmy tried to be smart, to freewheel on the moving sidewalk, but it stopped the moment he got on and wouldnt start again til he got off (it scans you, looks for your credit implant, usually on your wrist or behind your ear).I started searching for signposts and the quickest way out of the City, though actually, apart from what happened on the waterfront, things hadnt been anywhere near as bad as Id expected.Most streets were more or less functioning as normal.On the other hand, it was disturbingly quiet and I wondered if, maybe, we hadnt come across the main event yet.As we approached the commercial district and the up market shopping area I began to realize how right I was.You could feel the atmosphere starting to change.There were more people, a simmering clamor, and gradually, one sound that overwhelmed all others.I didnt recognize it at first.It was like a plague of insects, the cry of a thousand cicadas on a warm summer evening, but as we got closer, it finally hit me.It was a mass accumulation of alarms, hundreds and hundreds of them, all different notes, different kinds, all futilely signaling their premises had been breached, crying out for help that plainly wasnt gonna come.And as we turned the corner into one of the main shopping streets, finally we saw where everyone had gone.From one end to the other, as far as you could see, it was bedlam, with store after store being looted.People were using baseball bats, sledgehammers, scaffolding poles, anything to smash their way in.Within minutes, sometimes seconds, they reemerged laden down with so much stuff they could barely carry it.Their first few steps outside were always that bit tentative, taking a quick glance up at the sky, just to reassure themselves the satellites really werent working anymore.Jesus, I groaned, my thoughts immediately going back all those years to the Good Behavior Riots, when the state stopped paying the kids to stay out of trouble.Quite a party, Delilah croaked.I turned to Lena to explain what was going on, but she cut me short.I can guess.Youre better off not seeing this, Delilah told her.I dont know why, but I glanced at the kids, concerned how they would react.I wasnt altogether surprised to see Gordie looking just that little bit interested.Anything you like?I asked.He just shrugged and looked away, and I realized Id gone too far.Sorry, I said, patting him on the shoulder.Again he shrugged.That kids got a whole dictionary of them, and each and every ones got a different meaning.I was out of line, I added, but he still didnt seem that bothered.The one good thing about what was going on, leastways as far as we were concerned, was that, amongst it, the presence of a small group of Detainees was unlikely to be noticed.And you know, I dont condone such behaviorno matter what I used to get up to in the old days, Ive now come to see all crime as wrongbut as we made our way down that street, and despite all the mayhem, I couldnt help but feel that little bit relieved, that if that was it, their generations version of anarchy, then maybe we were getting off lightly.But I shouldve known better.We hadnt gone more than three or four blocks before we heard ita different sound this time, more potent, more threatening.In fact, it reminded me of being on the Island on a foggy night.There were the same wild shouts, the same frightened screams, the same summoning of madness.I guess we couldve worked our way around it, but our curiosity got the better of us.There was an open area, set back from the street, and something was really burning away in there.As we approached you could hear this kind of low grumbling, like an explosion that couldnt quite reach its detonation point but was furiously trying, and finally we came face to face with a scene which was much more in line with what Id been expecting.There was this shiny new shopping centreit couldnt have been open for long, but all eight or nine floors of it were blazing away like it was made of rice paper.And dancing all around, high on drink, drugs or merely adrenalin, thousands of rioters were, not only looting everything in sight, but burning it down as well.Most of the outside of the building was glass, and just as we rounded the corner some of its huge panes reached a point where they simply exploded, showering debris down on those below.Jesus!Not cool!Jimmy cried, instinctively backing away.All around us flames were leaping into the air the way they might when you light a barbecuethe same curve and characterbut a thousand times higher, a million times more potent.The whole world was alight.Worse still, there was a pitched battle going on.People were fighting all over, and it didnt take long to work out why.Looters were wrestling with looters, trying to steal what had already been stolen.A lot of them were armed with clubs or knives.I actually saw one guy stabbed to death by a gang of girls.I was going to get over there, try to stop them, but it was too late.They just grabbed up his stuffshoes, a handbag, maybe for his girlfriend or somethingand ran off.Not going far before they spotted someone else who had something they wanted, a teenage couple, and immediately surrounded them.Everywhere we looked people were being beaten, even slain, for something that was never theirs in the first place.Lets go, I told the others, though they were almost too stunned to move.Jimmy!Cant we help?Lena asked.I turned to her, saw those sightless eyes registering such confusion.No.We cant.When I took her hand there was a moment of resistance before I managed to persuade her that there was no other choice, that anything else would only be putting us all in danger, and we took off as quickly as we could.The kids having to be told to keep up, as if they would like to have stayed a little longer, that what we witnessed wasnt much more than entertainment to them.I mean, that was it, that was what I feared more than anything, that the loss of the satellites would result in total breakdown, and I shouldve known that was where itd be, in the home of designer labels and luxury goods.We saw two bodies on the sidewalk, still lying where theyd thrown themselves out of burning buildings, but we just kept going.This mightve once been my city, my home, but having seen what I had I didnt want to spend so much as a night there.I wanted to wake in the morning in a quiet country lane, or at the very least a leafy garden suburb, on the threshold of the countryside and freedom.What I didnt appreciate was how hard I was pushing everybody, including myself, to achieve that goal.A little later, Jimmy came pegging up to Lena and me, his limp worse than Id seen it in a while.Big Guy, we have to stop soon, he told me.Lile cant go much further.We gotta get out of this city, I told him.Tonight?he exclaimed.Uh huh, I replied, not letting my pace drop for a moment.Clancy, Lena protested.Were too tired.I was about to argue the point, but looking at her, realizing how much more difficult it mustve been, that shed been hanging onto my hand running into nothingness ever since we left the Island, I saw I had no choice.Okay, I sighed, a little reluctantly.Just for a few hours.We took a couple of side streets into an unfashionable area where things were a bit more downmarket, less likely to be of interest, and eventually came across this old abandoned carpet store.Lord knows how long itd been since it was in businesslong enough for rust to have melded shut the padlock and grill.I forced them apart, wrenched the wire aside, then kicked the front door open.The first thing we saw was the welcome sight of a pile of carpet offcuts, in all colors and sizes, that we could use to sleep on.Lena and me grabbed a handful and retired to the back office, Jimmy and Delilah pretty well flopped out where they were, while Gordie and Arturo did the same.Only Hanna spent any time choosing exactly where she wanted to be, ending up at the far end of the room, as far away from those boys as possible.The moment I lay down, I realized I was every bit as tired as everyone else.Every muscle and bone in my old body seemed to be setting up a chattering protest.And yet, with Lena asleep in my arms within minutes, I was wide awake, thoughts whipping around my head like trash in a typhoon.What do they say about never going back?This was supposed to be my home.Okay, so we were nowhere near my patch, but I had the feeling that even if I was, even if this was my old street, I still wouldnt feel warmly disposed toward it.To think we imagined this place would be heavenokay, so not our idea of heaven exactly, but someones, maybe.Only a few hours ago wed been making our way across from the Island, so excited to be free at last, at where we were going.Now look at us.So far weve confronted addicts, looters, arsonists, murderersthough all of them pale in comparison with Infinity.I mean, what the hells going on with them?Have they taken over law and order?And what does that mean for us?Just at that moment, Lena stirred in my arms, almost as if she could sense my fretting.You okay?she mumbled out of the dark, plainly only half awake.Were only stopping for a few hours, I reminded her.I want to be away from this place as soon as we can.I waited for a protest that I was being obsessive, but there was none, and I realized shed already fallen back to sleep.I kissed her on the forehead.I mean, whatever or wherever, Im still the luckiest dumb old big guy in the world.No question.The last thing I reminded myself before I finally succumbed to that unfamiliar darkness was that it was up to me.I would have to get everyone up at first light, ignore their inevitable grumbling and get them out on the road.Too bad if they hated me for it.Above everything, we needed to get away, out into the country, and resurrect our bid for freedom and a better life.Though, in fact, did I but know it, it was already too late.Into the Fire        TWO Sometimes I wonder if its sleep that wont come to me, or me that wont allow it, that I dont care for what it brings.Maybe it was being back in the City, my memories getting all stirred up, but I dreamed it was the old days and I was driving Mr.Meltoni.I could see that proud smile of his in my rearview mirror as he gazed out the window at his domain, the streets he owned, people nodding and bowing as we went by.As his main muscle and minder, I had it pretty good, I can tell you.Fancy lifestyle, plenty of money...plenty of R. E. S. P. E. C. T.  And yet, somewhere along the line, I dunno why, and no matter how much I loved the guy, I began to feel that what I was doing wasnt right.That nothing was worth what was going on, and especially not money.Even before he died, Id stopped getting my hands dirty.When he did finally pass on, well, it was an easy decision: I was going straight, off to start a new life.The only problem was, my timing couldnt have been worse.The world economy hadnt had another hiccough, more of a damn cardiac arrest.A combination of greed, demographics and straight out stupidity meant that even governments had gone broke, and could no longer afford to look after the needy, or the old, or the sick, nor could they provide any of the essentials like hospitals or schooling.If you couldnt pay for it, you couldnt have it, and that was it.The pension Id contributed to every month for all those years got lost somewhere, probably in some fat cats pocket.I was classified as an unsupported retireean old person with no money or familyand sent out with the rest of societys waste to live on the Island: a mountain of landfill in the middle of a polluted sea.I never dreamed I could hate life the way I did out there.No chance of escaping, not with those punishment satellitesif you tried, you got zapped.The only other inhabitants apart from us old folks were the kids.Kids who never got to go to school; whod always been told that old people and their selfishness were to blame for the worlds misfortunes, some whod got into trouble and whose parents couldnt afford to pay for their incarceration.And boy, did they have it in for us.Though the real bane of our torturous existence was the Wastelords.The Wastelords were the dyed in the wool Island survivors, young offenders, now adultswho abused the smaller kids in every way.They fed them drugs when the fog came down and the satellites werent working and encouraged them to go up to the Village and have a good timein other words, to run amok, butchering us, burning us out...I guess theres a worse life somewhere in this world, but I cant imagine it.However, if theres one thing I do know, its to never give up hope.One day I stumbled on this blind young woman living alone in the old subway tunnels, and from then on everything changed.Lena saved me, she took care of me, and finally, she gave me something I never thought Id know in my sad old big guy life: love.The two of us lived underground with Jimmy and Delilah, later joined by Gordie, Arturo and Hanna: the kids we captured, who became our friendswell, more like family really.Eventually the day came when we were forced into fighting the Wastelordsbut Jimmy had other, much grander ideas.He may be in his seventies, but when it comes to original computer geniuses, you wont find any better.Hes always tinkering with stuff, pulling it apart, putting bits with other bits so it does something else, things I wouldnt even begin to understand.He found a way of destroying the punishment satellites, which is how we all ended up out on that ocean last night.I dont know when exactly, but somewhere along the line my subconscious mustve decided that Lena had earned the right to be as present in my dream world as she is in my real one.And I guess as weve kept each other company just about every minute of the day and night since we became an item, thats not exactly surprising.What is surprisingand I can think of any number of people whod raise an eyebrow or twois that this level of companionship should happen to me.Id always seen myself as a loner, someone who prefers his own company to that of others.But I guess the truth is, there arent too many who want to admit to being lonely, and Im no exception.Theres a stigma attached, an implication that you aint so much lonely as a loser.I mean, Im sure there are people out there who prefer being on their own, course there are, but contrary to appearancescontrary to what Id always assumed myselfI aint one of them.And dont get the idea that Lenas around just to alleviate that condition either.Nothing could be further from the truth.That womans taught my tone deaf old heart to sing.Id give my life a thousand times over for herand that aint just talk either.Id die happy knowing I prolonged her existence for just one single day.And as I sit here, holding her in my arms, both of us silently gazing out across the lake in the park to the shimmering warmth of the trees on the other side (its gone now, they built on it twenty odd years ago), I know two things: one, that Im dreaming, and two, that when I awake, when I make that transition from this world to the other, shell be there beside me too.My eyes slowly blinked and batted their way open, instantly filling my mind with confusion: what the hell?Where was I?The first penny to drop was that I really was off that Island, that I hadnt dreamed it; the second was that I hadnt woken at dawn as Id promised myself; thered already been a big bite taken out of the day.I grabbed my watch, cursing when I saw it was nine fifty, and sat up with a real jolt.Lena woke but didnt say anything, just tried to pull me back down, to keep me with her a little longer.No, I told her, we gotta go!I released myself from her grip and struggled to my feet, aware that I was painfully stiff from last nights activities, that my old body was again complaining about being asked to do the work of a young one.Stumbling through to the showroom, I found the others also still asleep.Lets go!I shouted, jolting Jimmys shoulder.Kids, come on!We gotta get moving.I was about to go back and check Lena hadnt returned to sleep when it occurred to me that there was something odd about the lightit was kind of dull and purplish.I went to the front of the store and took a look out.At first I thought it was fog.I mean, they dont get a lot on the Mainland, not like we did out on the Island, but it does happen.However, I soon realized it was something else: a thick gauze of smoke that I saw first, and then smelled, kind of hot and dark and strongly chemical.I threw back the door and rushed out.One look was enough to see we had real trouble.There was a building burning further down the block, but it wasnt just that, the possibility that the flames might spread to us; more this feeling that during the night wed somehow got trapped.I hurried back inside.Come on, I shouted, frustrated by everybodys slow progress, particularly the kids, who didnt even seem to have the energy to get themselves upright.Lets go!Im hungry, little Arturo whined.Me too, agreed Gordie.Later, I told them.Now, come on!As we emerged from the store, the nearby blaze exploded across the narrow street as if from a flame thrower, instantly setting another building alight.Jesus, Big Guy!Jimmy gasped.Did you see that?I never commented, just took Lenas hand, the two of us locking together now like it was second nature.A dozen or so paces on, I glanced back and found Jimmy still gaping at the fire.Jimmy!I shouted, and he turned and started to peg after us, soon catching up with the dawdling kids.Little Arturo was still complaining he wanted something to eat and Delilah had a consoling arm around his shoulder.Lena kept sniffing the air, almost like she was taking in random samples for analysis.I can smell it again, she told me, that odor I noticed on our way over from the Island.It looks a bit like the Island, I observed, gazing around, cept this is smoke.How far can you see?I dunnomaybe forty, fifty yards?It depends.Again she sniffed, shaking her head as if she didnt quite understand.What is it thats burning?I looked at her for a moment, then back at the fire now disappearing into its own smoke.Everything, I told her, only in that moment realizing that was true, that there didnt seem to be a thing in that City that wasnt flammable.She was about to say something more but fell silent when I stopped at a junction, looking this way and that, trying to work out which way wed come the previous evening.That way, she told me, and without questioning it for a moment, I set off in the direction she indicated.When we got up to the main street and turned in the direction of the hillsthough with the smoke, of course, you couldnt see themit felt like wed joined an assault course.Everywhere you looked it was as if madness had been set free and told to do whatever it wanted.All manner of stuff had been discarded, Lord knows why.Maybe they saw something better, or just couldnt carry as much as theyd thought.I noticed this irradia fry, still in its box, covered in blood, more smeared handprints on the sidewalk nearby as if someone had been forced to crawl away on their hands and knees.Every possible window, every outdoor screen low enough to be reached, had been smashed.And fires, of course, still burning all over: some big, some small.To Jimmys continuing fascination, a couple actually exploded in front of us, swear to God, again shooting out streams of flame.It reminded me of those images you see of the surface of the sun: everything just bubbling away one moment, erupting with rainbows of fire the next.The front walls of several buildings had given way, spilling out across the sidewalk, while the blackened hulks of automatic buses were skewed all along the street, leastways as far as you could see.But you know, despite all the destruction and chaos and the fact that it was probably gonna kick off again later, there were still those determined to carry on with their normal lives.Off to their places of work, the office or store, hell bent on making it business as usual.The worst thing was the bodies.I dont know how many we sawit didnt occur to me to countbut its a sure sign that civilizations breaking down when you see corpses in the street.When no ones come to clear them away.I guess if the kids had come from anywhere but the Island we wouldve done everything we could to shield them from it.But theyve seen stuff like that all their lives.I dont think they gave it a second thought.There were a few looters already out and busy, very different animals from those whod rampaged through the previous night.Most of them looked to be old folk, though I didnt notice any Islanders, which made me wonder how many got away from those Dragonflies.There was something almost apologetic about their behavior.They were skulking from one place to another, their heads held low, as if they really didnt agree with what they were doing but had realized they had no other choice, that this was just the latest version of survival.At one point Hanna stopped, peering into this quaint but rather run down little store that like a lot of the less impressive looking places hadnt been touched.I went back to see what had caught her eye and was met by a slightly faded display of ballet clothes.More particularly a pair of shiny pink satin shoes.To be honest, Im not sure I wouldve said anything if shed picked up the nearest brick, smashed the window and taken them.For sure I dont know anyone whod put them to better use.And amongst all that ruckus, everything that was going on, what would it have mattered?But she just had her fill of looking, turned, smiled at me and carried on.The further out we went, into the old migrant suburbsChinese, Greek, Italianthe more we got into, well, not exactly home territory, but certainly more familiar.Eventually, despite the dense smoke and the years Id been away, I began to recognize places: a couple of businesses I used to collect money from for Mr.Meltoni, a pool hall where I used to play as a kid.It might sound odd, but in a way I was waiting to see what my reaction would be, how Id take to my first real memory.But do you know something?No matter where we were, or what we saw, there was nothing.I really didnt care Id spent the majority of my life there, that it was my hometown.For sure it didnt feel like it anymore.All I wanted was to get out into the open spaces, to see a whole horizon contributed to by no one but Nature, and until that happened, I wasnt going to feel truly free.By midafternoon the road began to ascend and we realized wed reached the more affluent suburbs, that though we might not be able to see them, wed started to climb the hills that half cup the City.I was reckoning on another three or four hours to get to the other side, but the higher we got, the more difficult the smoke became.It started to really sting our eyes and gouge the back of our throats, and poor old Delilah, with her one lung, was hacking away fit to burst.Clancy, Lena warned.I know.She cant go much further.I turned to Jimmy and he gave me this look, like he didnt want to say anything but couldnt put it off much longer.As soon as were over the hills, youll be fine, I reassured Delilah, feeling a little guilty.The cleanest, purest air youll ever breathe.Jimmy ignored my attempt at lightening the mood.I dont think she can make it, Big Guy.Im all rightkeep going, Delilah told us, but she was coughing so much no one took any notice.You go on, Jimmy said.Well go back down.This smokes gotta clear sometime.Well follow you.No!Delilah protested.I didnt know what to do.If things got any worse, I wouldnt bet on any of us getting throughyet it meant everything that we did.We should stick together, Lena said.Whatever we decide.I suggested finding some water, maybe wetting a handkerchief or something for Delilah to cover her nose; it might see her through.However, at that moment we saw this small group coming down the hill, emerging out of the smoke, coughing and spluttering, obviously in some distress.I didnt know whether to speak to them or notwho knows who you might be getting mixed up with?But as they got closer, I thought I recognized one of them from the Island.Hey!I called over.They slowed but didnt stop, I guess every bit as suspicious of us as we were them.Youre Detainees, right?I asked, a look of recognition coming to one guys face.Whats it like up there?Theres no way out, he told us, breaking off from the group.The Citys completely surrounded by fire.He just stood there for a moment, then kind of nodded apologetically, as if embarrassed to be the bringer of such bad news, before hurrying after his companions as they began to disappear down the hill into the smoke.For a few moments none of us could bring ourselves to say anything; the only sound was Delilahs sporadic breathless hacking.Shit!I groaned.At least that makes the decision for us, Lena said, though there was real concern in her voice.Why dont I take a look?I suggested.Theres gotta be some way out.Clancy!she said, a little irritated by my stubbornness.Again there was silence.I mean, she was right, of course she was.The only trouble was, we had no Plan B.  Nor C or D, come to that.This is worse than the Island, Hanna suddenly ventured, as if she felt it was about time she gave her verdict.I almost burst into laughter.That kid rarely says a word, but when she does, she has a habit of hitting matters right on the head.Just swapped fog for smoke, Delilah complained, again starting to cough.And were prisoners again, Gordie added.Hey, heycome on, I said, not wanting to hear all this negative talk.How long can fires burn?These fires?Jimmy answered.Who knows?Nah!Bit of rain, change in wind direction, theyll be gone.And so will we.Nobody replied, and I knew why.It might not be that far away, but the weather on the Mainlands completely different from the Island.Over there you can get four seasons in a day; here, with the surrounding hills, high pressure, things can get really locked in.This time of year, we might not see a change for weeks, maybe longer.Im hungry!Arturo complained again, the way kids do, as if all this life or death stuff is of no consequence compared with the demands of their bellies.I paused, my eyes resting on him, my thoughts elsewhere, until it occurred to me that probably it wasnt such a bad idea, that things might look better if we got a little food in us.I aint got an ounce of pride, not anymore, not after living on the Island knowing the sorts of things we had to do to survive, some of the stuff we had to eat.Thing is, if youre not too fussy, youd be surprised what people throw away.We know that better than anyone.Id noticed this little restaurant on the way up: Il Pomodoro Rosso, recently painted but now looking a little smoke stained, the big Italian flag needing a wash.The windows had been boarded upI guess as protection against looters, though I couldnt imagine it would be much of a deterrent to those we saw rampaging through the City the previous night.We retraced our footsteps, headed up the side alley, found the trashcans and started to pick our way through them.Okay, so hunger is the best sauce, but I still gotta say a lot of what we dug out was a helluvan improvement over what we ate on the Island.The only thing was, wed assumed the place was empty, but while we were busily chomping away, the back door suddenly burst open and this guy came out pointing a fancy looking hunting rifle at us.What are you doing?he demanded.I put my hands up, more in a gesture of apology than anything.Sorry.We were really hungry.We got kids with us.We thought...you know, its just garbage.He stared at us as if we were some kind of new lowlife he hadnt come across before and didnt have a name for.Bearing in mind the way we looked, I guess that was understandable.Get the hell out of here, he said, choosing to level his weapon at me.I wasnt going to argue, especially now there were no satellites up there to stop him.I apologized again and led the others up the alleyway, the guy still squinting down the sight of his rifle, his trigger finger looking like it might twitch at any moment.Friendly, Delilah commented, once we got back up to the street.Very.We walked on in silence, the full impact of our situation weighing heavier by the moment.What the hell were we going to do?How were we going to survive?This place was worse than the Islandmaybe a whole lot worse.And, of course, the irony was, we were partly to blame.It was us who took out the satellites, who started the fires (or some of them) that caused all this smoke.Clancy?Lena said, interrupting my thoughts.We gotta find somewhere safe for the night.I grunted my agreement.Without satellites, there was no reason why those looting and burning should confine their activities mostly to the night, but for some reason, you knew they would.That as if responding to some primeval call, theyd keep the very worst of their excesses for darkness.The hardcore, those wed do best to avoid.A lot of properties looked beaten up and deserted, but when you got closer, peered in the window or something, there were people inside.Those whod already been the subject of intruders and were pretty hostile toward any more.We got chased by this armed gang, who mightve made a real mess of us if they hadnt been distracted by an intact sports store with a window full of sneakers.Night was rapidly starting to fall, pressing down on the smoke, compounding its darkness.In the far distance, deep in a remote fold, you could hear the sound of something starting up youd rather not know about.None of us had spoken for a while and there was this sense that hope was dying with the remains of the day when Jimmy spotted this ruined church set back from the street.All of us stopped and peered through the railings, even Lena, though she was sniffing rather than looking.It didnt appear that invitingjust a few walls, as crumpled as Christianity, in the middle of an overgrown churchyard; the odd gravestone poking out of the surging undergrowth like debris through floodwater.But at least it had the advantage of being isolated from other buildings, so that thered be no chance of a fire spreading to it.Stay here, I said, thinking Id check it out, but Lena had other ideas.Isnt it dark?she asked.Getting there, I admitted.Then you need me.I thought about refusing, saying I preferred to go alone, but it was obvious how important it was to her.Yeah.Sure.Slowly we began to pick our way through the tangle and whip of the undergrowth, expecting an angry shout at any moment, ready to turn and run.There was a path worn through there where someone had been in and out many times.However, Lena stopped, sniffed the air several times and finally gave it the nod.Its okay.I trusted her senses.I breathed a sigh of relief and made my way into the building.Actually it wasnt much more than flagstones and mud, with walls on two sides, a little bit of roof, but most of it open to the elements.I was right; at some point quite recently itd been someones home.There was garbage everywhere, and the remains of a fire, and theyd used one corner as a latrine.I sighed as if to indicate that maybe we should keep looking, but Lena put a hand on my shoulder.Its okay, she said.If it was nice, everyone would want it.You sure?Yeah.I went outside, headed back toward the street and waved the others in.The moment they entered, Delilah and the kids started complaining about the smell.Im sorry, I told them.The palace was fully booked.Well, Im not sleeping anywhere near that, Delilah croaked, gesturing at the corner.Me neither!Arturo chimed in.What about down below?Lena suggested.There was a slight pause, no one really understanding.What dyou mean?I asked.The cellar or crypt or whatever it is.It always amazes me what she smells, senses or hears.Really, its like shes some superior being.And sure enough, on closer inspection, in a corner, barely discernible in the darkplus someone had made a bit of a half hearted attempt to disguise it with a couple of broken gravestoneswe found a flight of steps.I squatted on my haunches, peering down, but all I could see was black.No!Delilah croaked, backing away.No, thank you!Without saying a word, Lena pushed past us and began to feel her way down.Hey!I protested, but she was already disappearing from sight.We just stood there, helplessly waiting, yet again reminding ourselves that for her to stumble around in the dark was nothing unusual, that that was all she ever did.Are you okay?I called, but there was no reply.Lena!Come on down, she shouted at last.With some difficulty I made my way down, the point that there wasnt a lot of room painfully emphasized by my head bumping on the overhanging stonework.One by one the others followed, the last a grumbling Delilah.I guess we were hoping for better things, but together we created nothing but chaos, everyone blundering around in the pitch black, bumping into each other, tripping over, and yet again it crossed my mind that it was a valuable insight into Lenas world.Just settle down where you are, she told us, with a touch of impatience.At least its dry.We tried to do as she asked but ended up falling over each other, sitting in each others laps, getting in a real tangle.Theres more room over here!she shouted.Hey!The kids started getting in an argument, accusing each other of all sorts of things, Hanna whopping Gordie, who promptly threatened to lay her out, girl or no girl.Okay!Okay!I shouted.Thats not helping.Finally, we sorted ourselves out, but no matter how tired we were, how long the day, I dont think anyone was in the least bit comfortable.After a while I became aware that there was the tiniest glow of light spilling down, but initially I felt like I was being asked to bed down on nothingness, to fall back until I came across something solid to support me.Not to mention that our sudden departure from the Island meant we hadnt brought a thing with usno blankets, no matches, just the clothes we were dressed in.And it wasnt long before we realized how cold it was.The night started with everyone feeling out their own little space, making themselves as comfortable as they could, but it wasnt long before I heard Arturo snuggle in with Delilah and Jimmy.To my surprise, a little later, not only Hanna joined Lena and me, but eventually Gordie as well, though the tough little guy did stick it out as long as he could and, by the time he gave up, was trembling like a leaf.It took us forever to warm him up.But slowly our weariness and the endless hours of walking overwhelmed us and one by one we fell asleep.Couple of times in the night Gordie kneed me in the back, which I guess was his way of telling me I was snoring.Mind you, I gotta say, despite not having a clue as to my surroundings, just what that darkness held, I did sleep unusually well.However, in the morning, with a little daylight filtering down, I gotta bit of a shockwe all did.I suppose we shouldve guessed.It was a churchwhat would you expect in the cellar of a church if not a crypt?I opened my eyes to find myself surrounded by any number of graves and carved inscriptionsaround the walls, the floorand when Delilah stirred, I tell ya, she practically screamed the place down.What the hell?she cried, gaping all around.What is it?Jimmy asked, waking with a jolt.Look!He took a couple of moments, but then just shrugged.Theyre not going to do you any harm, he said, though you could see he wasnt entirely comfortable with the situation himself.However, at that moment Delilah realized not only had she been sleeping in a crypt, but her actual bed, the flagstone shed been lying on, was a grave.For the love of God!she shrieked, leaping up with an agility I wouldnt normally associate with her.I been sleeping with the dead!Lile!In the arms of a skeleton!Listen, I said, Id rather lie with the dead than leave myself open to those whod make me that way.I was kind of pleased with that, but she didnt even notice.This place must be jam packed with ghosts.I bet they had a real party last night jumping in and out of our souls.Delilah!Youre scaring the kids, Lena told her.I dont know how she knew it, but she was right.All three of them were starting to look just that little bit uneasy, especially little Arturomaybe cuz he kind of regards Delilah as his ma now, and dont like to see her upset.Im going outside, she said, making heavy weather of the steep stone steps.Dont worry, Jimmy told Arturo, the moment she was gone.Theres no such thing as ghosts.There is!the little guy came back.We saw them!When?Jimmy frowned.On the beach!They werent ghosts!Zombies!Gordie cried.Gordie...I warned.They were!Arturo insisted, and promptly headed off upstairs, as if to make it perfectly clear whose side he was on in this.A few moments later we went up to join them, and found it was substantially warmer outside than in the crypt.Probably the damp, Jimmy suggested.That aint whats chilling my bones, Delilah complained.But gradually it became less of a griping session and more of a meeting.There was a lot to discuss, the most pressing subject being whether we should try to find somewhere else to stay, or just stick it out where we were.Delilah, of course, was all for moving onin fact, she swore shed rather swim back to the Island than spend another night in that damp ghost infested pit.However, as Jimmy pointed out, it was relatively safe and in the end, and despite a lot of grouching and grumbling, we managed to convince her to stay at least one more night.Thing is, if were staying, Lena said, were going to need stuff.Food, water, blankets.Delilah grunted dismissively, as if the plan was breaking down already.For a few moments there was silence, no one caring to voice what I thought was obvious.Well, I sighed, knowing it had to be said, I guess that dont leave us with a great deal of choice.What?Arturo asked.We have to go looting.Again there was a pause.Going on what wed witnessed the previous night, I dont think any of us fancied it very much.Ill go, Lena volunteered.No, I told her.Course!Lena!What?I hesitated.I didnt want to say it, but I didnt have a great deal of choice.You dont know the area, I eventually told her, both of us well aware that wasnt exactly what I was saying.She went all quiet, maybe trying to come up with some logical argument why she should go, but there wasnt one.It made me feel really bad.Wed only been on the Mainland a day or so but her blindness had already become more of an issue.Taking her looting with us, in a strange area, with all manner of broken and smashed debris aroundit was out of the question.I wanted to say I was sorry, but I knew it would be a mistake, that shed get angry with me if I even hinted at it.Jimmy?I asked the little guy.Sure, he said, as if thered never been the slightest doubt.Me, too, Gordie chipped in.I turned and looked at him.He may only be a kid, but surviving for so long on the Island means he knows how to take care of himself.My only concern was he was a fairly recently rehabilitated member of the enemy and there were a lot of temptations out there.Okay, I said, not wanting him to sense any hesitation.And me!Arturo piped up.It took a while, and a fair amount of argument, but in the end I managed to convince the little guy to stay by telling him I needed someone to take care of the women.Do I get to tell them what to do?he asked.Yeah, sure, I told him, silently wishing him good luck with that.I mean, I wouldnt try giving Hanna orders, let alone Lena or Delilah.I went and put my arms around Lena, still feeling bad about her not being able to come and not knowing what I could say to make it better.Be careful, she warned, as if that was the only thing that mattered.I gave her a big hug, squeezing her against my body.With what was out there, I needed all the strength she could give me.Into the Fire        THREE Really, all we needed to do was to keep a low profile, not to attract attention in any way, to fade in and out of the smoke.I mean, yeah, technically were on the runwe committed a Crime Against the State, after allbut amongst everything else thats going on, I didnt think that would be a priority.Peopleve got more important things to worry about.Turns out its not easy to mind your own business where looting and lawlessness is concerned, and it didnt take long to realize.As soon as we arrived in the shopping district there seemed to be nothing but fights going on all over.I saw a couple of old ladies wrestling with each other over toilet paper.Can you believe that?They mustve been eighty if they were a day.Both of them ended up coughing and wheezing, having to sit down, almost having a heart attack over a roll of ass wipe.People were arguing and fighting over all sorts of stuff as if they were worried stiff there might be a shortage, whether it was something they used or not.Lootingand Im talking about the essential kind here; I got no truck with the otheraint just a matter of going to the nearest store and helping yourself.Like I said before, a lot of people were doing their best to carry on with their usual lives.You gotta search for an area where you know law and orders broken down, somewhere mostly trashed and burned, but where theres still the odd thing left to be taken.It took us a while, especially as we had to detour around what was probably the biggest and most ferocious fire wed seen, exploding and popping away, ripping through everything, plainly not gonna stop til it took out the whole block, but eventually we located this one department store which had still been looted but looked like it had a few bits and pieces left inside.We hung around in the street for a few minutes, conquering our nervesnone of us had done anything like that beforethen cautiously entered through one of the many smashed windows.The atmosphere inside was surprisingly subdued.You could sense something had happened, that emotions had run riot, but now everything was just drained and cold.There were a few looters at work, but it all felt a bit half hearted.People were picking over stuff, dragging things out from beneath mounds of rubble, then considering them seriously, deciding whether it was worth bothering with or not.We climbed the motionless escalators to the fourth floor, where signs pointed the way to the bedding department.We werent very hopeful of finding anything useful but actually scooped up a few discarded blankets and pillows thatd obviously been dropped, maybe by someone rushing to get out.Then we went down to the basement food hall, but our luck had run out.It was stripped completely bare, with not so much as a drop of water or a single potato chip left.My stomach was starting to remember how long it was since itd last been full.We left the building the same way we entered, relieved at how easy it had beenthat there hadnt been any trouble.Not to mention the fact that wed all be sleeping a little more comfortably that night.Most of the big stores had been ransacked, so a block or so further on we thought wed try a different approach and started venturing off down the side streets.It wasnt long before we came across this traditional old camping store.Someone had already paid them a visit and it took us a while, but eventually we managed to find enough useful stuff: a couple of backpacks, parkas, sleeping bags, all ideal for our situation.Gordie even found a hunting knife, which, to his annoyance, I immediately pocketed.I thought it was far better with me than him.Unfortunately though, the search for food and water turned out to be another matter altogether.We tried store after store, always with the same result: endless bare shelves and nothing but maybe a little melted ice in the freezers.I didnt know where else we could look, and Jimmy wasnt being a great deal of help.He was forever getting distracted by all the technological innovations thered been while we were away on the Island.I kept hearing him whistling over and over at how cool something wasparticularly the screens.It looked like they could now read people as they pass by, not only addressing you by name, but directing targeted adverts toward you, based on your hobbies, make of phone, choice of shampoo, any damn thing.But not us, of course.
