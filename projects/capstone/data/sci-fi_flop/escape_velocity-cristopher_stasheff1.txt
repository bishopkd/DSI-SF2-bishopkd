 She was a girl.Dar knew it the moment he saw her.That wasnt as easy as it sounds.Really.Considering that she was shaved bald and was wearing a baggy gray flannel coverall, Dar was doing pretty well to identify her as human, let alone female.It wouldve been a much better bet that she was a department store mannequin in one of those bags that are put on them between outfits, to protect them in case somebody with a plastic fetish comes along.But she moved.Thats how Dar knew she was human.And he was just in from a six week trading tour and was just about to go out on another one (Cholly, the boss, was shorthanded this month; one of his traders had been caught shaving percentage points with Occams Razor).Which meant, since the Wolmar natives didnt allow their womenfolk to meet strangers, that for the last six weeks Dar had seen things that were human, and things that were female, but never both at the same time; so he was in a prime state to recognize a girl if one happened along.This one didnt happenshe strode.She nearly swaggered, and she stepped down so hard that Dar suspected she was fighting to keep her hips from rolling.It sort of went with the gray jumpsuit, bald head, and lack of makeup.She sat down on a bar stool, and waited.And waited.And waited.The reason she waited so long was that Cholly was alone behind the bar today and was discussing the nature of reality with a corporal; he wasnt about to give up a chance at a soldier.Not that the girl seemed to mind.She was ostentatiously not looking at the two privates at the other end of the bar, but her ears fairly twitched in their direction.He niver had a chance, the gray haired one burbled around his cigar.He but scarcely looked up, and whap!I had him!Took him out good and proper, hey?The blond grinned.Out!I should say!So far out he ant niver coming back!Mark my words, hell buy the farm!Buy it for me yet, he will!The girls lips pinched tight, and her throat swelled the way someones does when they cant hold it in anymore and its just got to bust loose; and Dar figured hed better catch it, cause the soldiers wouldnt understand.But Dar would.After six weeks without women, he was ready to understand anything, provided it came from a female.So he sidled up to lean on the bar, neatly intersecting her line of sight, smiled with all the sincerity he could dredge up, and chirped, Service is really slow around here, isnt it?She got that blank look of total surprise for a minute; then her lip curled, and she spat, Yes, unless youre looking for death!You seem to dish it up awfully fast around here, just because youre wearing a uniform!Uniform?Dar looked down at his heavy green coveralls and mackinaw, then glanced over at the two soldiers, who were looking surprised and thinking about feeling offended.He turned back to the girl, and said quickly.Fraid I dont follow you, miz.Hasnt been a killing around here all year.Sure, she retorted, its January seventh.And what were those two bums over there talking about, if it wasnt murder?She had to point.She just had to.Making sure Dar couldnt pretend shed been talking about two CPOs walking by in the street, no doubt.To make it worse, judging by their accents, the two privates were from New Perth, where bum had a very specific meaning that had absolutely nothing to do with unemployment.The older private opened his mouth for a bellow, but Dar cut in quicker.Points, miz.You can believe me or not, but they were talking about points.She looked doubtful for a fraction of a second, but only a fraction.Then her face firmed up again with the look of someone whos absolutely sure that shes right, especially if shes wrong.She demanded, Why should I believe you?What are you, if you arent a soldier?Dar screwed up his hopes and tried to look casual.Well, I used to be a pilot   Am I supposed to be impressed?she said sourly.They told me girls would be, when I enlisted.Dar sighed.Its got to work sometime.I thought this planet was an Army prison.It is.The Army has ships too.Why?She frowned.Doesnt it trust the Navy to do its shipping?Something like that.You say that with authority.What kind of ship did you pilota barge?A space tug, Dar admitted.She nodded.What are you now?Dar shrugged, and tried to look meek.A trader.A trader?She spoke with such gleeful indignation that even Cholly looked upfor a second, anyway.So youre one of the vampires whore victimizing the poor, helpless natives!Helpless!the old private snortedwell, roared, really; and Dar scratched his head and said, Um, fraid youve got your cables crossed, miz.I wouldnt exactly say whos doing the victimizing.Well, I would!she stormed.Stampeding out here, victimizing these poor people, trying to take over their land and destroy their cultureits always the same!Its all part of a pattern, a pattern as old as Cortez, and it just goes on and on and on!Dont give a damn what the people want; give em technology!Dont give a damn whether or not their religions perfectly adequate for emgive em the Bible!Dont ask whether or not they own the placeherd em onto reservations!Or make slaves of em!Oh, Ive heard about it, Ive read about it!Its just starting here, but you wait and see!Its genocide, thats what it is!Its the worst kind of imperialism!And all being practiced by the wonderful, loyal soldiers of our miraculously democratic Interstellar Dominion Electorates!Imperialists!And she spat.The two soldiers swelled up like weather balloons, and the weather was going to be bad, so Cholly yanked himself out of his talk and hurried down to the end of the bar to put in a soothing word or two.As he passed Dar, he muttered, Now, then, lad, whutve I told ye?Reason, doncha know, now, Dar, reason!Try it, theres a good fellow, just try it!An youll see.Sweet reason, now, Dar!And he hurried on down to the end of the bar.Dar thought hed been trying reason already, and so far it hadnt been turning out sweetly; but he took a deep breath, and set himself to try it again.Now, then, miz.Uh, first off, Id say we didnt exactly stampede out here.More like a roundup, actually.She frowned.Whatre you talking about?Oh.You mean because this is a military prison planet.Well, something of that sort, yes.She shrugged.Makes no difference.Whether you wanted to come here or not, youre hereand theyre shipping you in by the thousands.Well, more like the hundreds, really.Dar scratched behind his ear.We get in maybe two hundred, three hundred, ah   Colonists, she said sternly.prisoners, Dar finished.Per year.Personally, Id rather think of myself as a recruit.Doesnt make any difference, she snapped.Its what you do after you get here that counts.You go out there, making war on those poor, innocent natives  and you traders go cheating them blind.Oh, Ive heard what youre up to.Oh, you have?Dar perked up.Hey, were gettin famous!Whered you hear about us, huh?She shrugged impatiently.What does it matter?A lot, to me.To most of us, for that matter.When youre stuck way out here on the fringe of the Terran Sphere, you start caring a lot about whether or not peopleve ever heard about your planet.Be nice to feel even that important.Mm.Her face softened a moment, in a thoughtful frown.Well  Im afraid this wont help much.I used to be a clerk back on Terra, in the records section of the Bureau of Otherworldly Activitiesand a report about Wolmar came through occasionally.Oh.Dar could almost feel himself sag.Just official reports?She nodded, with a vestige of sympathy.Thats right.Nobody ever saw them except bureaucrats.And the computer, of course.Of course.Dar heaved a sigh and straightened his shoulders.Well!Thats better than nothing  I suppose.Whatd they say about us?Enough.She smiled vindictively.Enough so that I know this is a prison planet for criminal soldiers, governed by a sadomasochistic general; that scarcely a day passes when you dont have a war going on  Holidays, Dar murmured, and Sundays.Scarcely, I said!And that youve got an extremely profitable trade going with the natives for some sort of vegetable drug, in return for which you give them bits of cut glass and surplus spare parts that you order through the quartermaster.Thats all?Dar asked, crestfallen.All!She stared, scandalized.Isnt that enough?What did you wanta list of war crimes?Oh  Dar gestured vaguely.Maybe some of the nice thingslike this tavern, and plenty of leave, and   Military corruptness.Slackness of discipline.She snorted.Sure.Maybe if Id stayed with the Bureau, a piece of whitewash wouldve crossed my desk.If youd stayed with them?Dar looked up.Youre not with BOA anymore?She frowned.If I were working for the Bureau, would I be here?Dar just looked at her for a long moment.Then he shook himself and said, Miz, the only reason I can think of why you would be here is because BOA sent you.Who could want to come here?Me, she said, with a sardonic smile.Use your head.Could I dress like this if I worked for the government?Dars face went blank.Then he shrugged.I dunno.Could you?Of course not, she snapped.Id have to have a coiffeured hairdo, and plaster myself with skintight see throughs and spider heels.I had to, for five years.Oh.You didnt like it?Would you like to have to display yourself everyday so a crowd of the opposite sex could gawk at you?Dar started a slow grin.Well, I didnt!she snapped, reddening.And thats why you quit?More than that, she said grimly.I got fed up with the whole conformist ragout, so I aced out instead.Aced out?Dar was totally lost.Aced out!Quit!Got out of all of it!she shouted.I turned into a Hume!Whats a Hume?She stared, scandalized.You really are away from it all out here, arent you?Ive kinda been trying to hint about something along those lines, yes.We get the news whenever a freighter lands, about three times a year.So until they invent faster than light radio, were not going to know whats happening on Terra until a couple of years after its happened.She shook her head in exasperation.Talk about primitive!All right  a Hume is mea nonconformist.We wear loose gray coveralls like this to hide our bodies from all those lascivious, leering eyes.We shave our heads, so we dont have to do up a pompadour everyday.And we dont submit to those prisons society calls jobs; wed rather be poor.Weve put in our time, weve got some savings, and between that, our GNP share, and whatever we can pick up at odd jobs, we manage to keep going.We do what we want, not what the I. D. E.  wants.Thats whats a Hume.Dar nodded, lips pursed and eyes slightly glazed.Uh.But you dont conform.Right.I didnt say that, gnappie!I said were nonconformists.Uhright.Dar nodded.I see the differenceor Ill try to.She turned on him, but Cholly got there first.Do thet, lad!Do thet, and youll make me proud of you!But you see, you have to know the history of it, dont you?Of course you do; cant understand nothing wots happening in human society if you dont know the history of it.The first who was called Nonconformists, see, they started showing up toward the end of the 1500s, now.Shakespeare wrote one of em into Twelfth Night, called him Malvolio.Puritans, they was, and Calvinists, and Baptists, too, and Anabaptists, all manner of Protestant sects what wasnt Church of England.And the Anglicans, they lumped em all together and called em Nonconformists (the name got put on em from the outside, you see, the way it always does) cause they didnt conform to the Established Church (what was C.  of E. , of course).Yet if you sees the pictures of em, like Cromwells Roundheads, why!theyre like to one another as bottles in a case!Within their opposition culture, you sees, they conformed much more tightly than your C.  of E. sand so it has been, ever since.When you call em nonconformists, it doesnt mean they dont conform to the standards of their group, but that their group dont conform to the majority cultureand thats why any opposition cultures called nonconformist.Now then, Sergeant  And he was off again, back to the reality case.The Hume stared after him, then nodded thickly.Hes right, come to think of it  She gave herself a shake, and scowled at Dar.What was thata bartender, or a professor?Cholly, Dar said, by way of explanation.My boss.The Hume frowned.You mean you work here?WHOA!Dar saw the indignation rise up in her, and grinned.Thats right.Hes the owner, president, and manager of operations for the Wolmar Pharmaceutical Trading Company, Inc.The boss drug runner?she cried, scandalized.The robber baron?The capitalist slave master?Not really.More like the bookkeeper for a cooperative.She reared up in righteous wrath, opening her mouth for a crushing witticismbut couldnt think of any, and had to content herself with a look of withering scorn.Dar obligingly did his best to wither.She turned away to slug back a swallow from her glassthen stared, suddenly realizing that she had a glass.Dar glanced at Cholly, who looked up, winked, nodded, and turned back to discussing the weightier aspects of kicking a cobble.The Hume seemed to deflate a little.She sighed, shrugged, and took another drink.Hospitable, anyway  She turned and looked up at Dar Besides, can you deny it?Dar ducked his headdown, around, and back up in hopes of a sequitur.Deny what?All of it!Everything Ive said about this place!Its all true, isnt it?Starting with your General Governor!Oh.Well, I can deny that General Shacklars a sadist.But he is a masochist?Dar nodded.But hes very well adjusted.As to the rest of it  well, no, I cant deny it, really; but I would say youve gotten the wrong emphasis.Im open to reason, the Hume said, fairly bristling.Explain it to me.Dar shook his head.Cant explain it, really.Youve got to experience it, see it with your own eyes.Yes.Of course.She rolled her eyes up.And how, may I ask, am I supposed to manage that?Uhhhh  Dars mind raced, frantically calculating probable risks versus probable benefits.It totaled up to 50 50, so he smiled and said, Well, as it happens, Im going out on another trading mission.Youre welcome to come along.I cant guarantee your safety, of coursebut its really pretty tame.The Hume stared, and Dar could almost see her suddenly pulling back, withdrawing into a thickened shell.But something clicked, and her eyes turned defiant again.All right.She gulped the rest of her drink and slammed the glass back down on the bar.Sure.She stood up, hooking her thumbs in her pockets.Ready to go.Wheres your pack mule?Dar grinned.Its a little more civilized than thatbut its just out back.Shall we?And he bowed her toward the door.She spared him a last withering glance, and marched past him.Dar smiled, and followed.As they passed Cholly and the sergeant, the bartender was saying earnestly, So Descartes felt he had to prove it all, dont you seeeverything, from the ground up.No assumptions, none.Ayuh.Ah kin see thet.The sergeant nodded, frowning.Ifn he assumed anything, and thet one thing turned out to be wrong, everything else hed figgered outd be wrong, too.Right, right!Cholly nodded emphatically.So he stopped right there, dont you see, took out a hotel room, and swore hed not stir till hed found some one thing he could prove, some one way to be sure he existed.And he thought and he thought, and it finally hit him.Whut dud?He was thinking!And ifn he wuz thinking, there had to be someone there to do the thinking!And that someone was him, of courseso the simple fact that he was thinking proved he existed!Ay y y y uh!The sergeants face lit with the glow of enlightenment, and the Hume stopped in the doorway, turning back to watch, hushed, almost reverent.Cholly nodded, glowing, victorious.So he laid it out, right then and there, and set it down on paper, where he could read it.Cogito, ergo sum, he wrotefor he wrote in Latin, dont you see, all them philosphers did, back thenCogito, ergo sum; and it means I think; therefore: I exist.Ay y y y uh.Ayuh, I see.The sergeant scratched his head, then looked up at Cholly again.Well, thenthats whut makes us human, aint it?Thinking, I mean.The Hume drew in a long, shuddering breath, then looked up at Dar.What is thisa tavern, or a college?Yes.Dar pushed the door open.Shall we?They came out into the light of early afternoon.Dar led the Hume to a long, narrow grav sled, lumpy with trade goods under a tarpaulin.No room for us, Im afraidevery ounce of lift has to go to the payload.We walk.Not till I get an answer.The Hume planted her feet, and set her fists on his hips.Answer?Dar looked up, surprised.To what?To my question.This boss of yourswhat is he?A capitalist?An immoral, unethical, swindling trader?A bartender?Or a professor?Oh.Dar sat down on his heels, checking the fastenings of the tarp.Well, I wouldnt really call him a capitalist, cause he never really does more than break even; and hes as moral as a preacher, and as ethical as a statue.And hes never swindled anybody.Aside from that, though, youve pretty well pegged him.Then he is a professor!Dar nodded.Used to teach at the University of Luna.The Hume frowned.So what happened?Whats he doing tending bar?Dar shrugged.I think he got the idea from his last name: Barman.Barman?She frowned.Cholly Barman?Whoa!Not Charles T.  Barman!Dar nodded.But hes famous!I mean, hes got to be the most famous teacher alive!Well, notorious, anyway.Dar gave the fastenings a last tug and stood up.He came up with some very wild theories of education.I gather they werent too popular.So I heard.But I cant figure why; all he was saying was that everybody ought to have a college education.And thereby threatened the ones who already had it.Dar smiled sweetly.But it was more than that.He thinks all teaching ought to be done on a one to one basis, which made him unpopular with the administratorsimagine having to pay that many teachers!and thought the teaching ought to be done in an informal environment, without the student realizing he was being taught.That meant each professor would have to have a cover role, such as bartending, which made him unpopular with the educators.The Hume frowned.I didnt hear about that part of it.Dar shrugged.He published it; it was there to read, if you managed to get hold of a copy before the LORDS party convinced the central book feed to quit distributing it down the line to the retail terminals.Yes.Her mouth flattened, as though shed tasted something sour Freedom of the press isnt what it used to be, is it?Not really, no.But you can see why the talk gets so deep, back in there; Cholly never misses a chance to do some teaching on the side.When hes got em hooked on talk, he lets em start hanging out in the back roomits got an open beer keg, and wall to wall books.She nodded, looking a little dazzled.You dont sound so innocent of books yourself, come to think of it.Dar grinned, and picked up the towrope.Shall we go?They trudged down the alley and out into the plastrete street, the Hume walking beside Dar, brooding.Finally she looked up.But whats he doing out here?I mean, hes putting his theories into practice, thats clearbut why here?Why not on some fat planet in near Terra?Well, the LORDS seem to have had something to do with that.That bunch of fascists!I knew they were taking over the Assemblybut I didnt know they were down on education!Figure it out.Dar spread his hands.They say they want really efficient central government; they mean totalitarianism.And one of the biggest threats to a totalitarian government is a liberal education.Oh.Her face clouded.Yes, of course.So what did they do?Well, Cholly wont go into much detail about it, but I gather they tried to assassinate him on Luna, and he ran for it.The assassins chased him, so he kept runningand he wound up here.Isnt he still worried about assassins?Dar flashed her a grin.Not with Shacklar running the place.By the way, if were going to be traveling together, we really oughta get onto a first name basis.Im Dar Mandra.He held out his hand.She seemed to shrink back again, considering the offer; then, slowly, she extended her own hand, looking up at him gravely.Samantha Bine.Call me Sam.Dar gave her hand a shake, and her face his warmest smile.Good to meet you, Sam.Welcome to education.Yes, she said slowly.There is a lot here that wasnt in the reports, isnt there?Sam looked at the town gate as they passed through it, and frowned.A little archaic, isnt it?I thought walled towns went out with the Middle Ages.Only because the attackers had cannon, which the Wolmen didnt have when this colony started.But they do now?Well, Dar hedged, lets say theyre working on it.Hey!You, there!Halt!They looked back to see a corporal in impeccable battle dress running after them.Here now, Dar Mandra!he panted as he caught up with them.You know better than to go hiking out at two oclock!Is it that late already?Dar glanced up at the sun.Yeah, it is.My, how the time flies!He hauled the grav sled around.Come on, Sam.Weve gotta get back against the wall.Why?Sam came along, frowning.Whats wrong?Nothing, really.Its just that its time for one of those continual battles you mentioned.Time?Sam squawked.You mean you schedule these things?Sure, at 8 a. m.  and 2 p. m. , eight hours apart.That gives everybody time to rest up, have lunch, and let it digest in between.Eight hours?She frowned.Theres only six hours between eight and two!No, eight.Wolmars got a twenty eight hour day, so noons at fourteen oclock.He pulled the sled up against the wall and leaned back against it.Now, whatever you do, make sure you stay right here.Dont worry.Sam settled herself back against the plastrete, folding her arms defiantly.I want to get back to Terra to tell about this.I dont intend to get hit by a stray beam.Oh, no chance of thatbut you might get trampled.Brightly colored figures rose over the ridge, and came closet Sam stiffened.The natives?Dar nodded.The Wolmen.Purple skin?No, thats a dye they use to decorate their bodies.I think the chartreuse loincloths go rather well with it, dont you?The warriors drew up in a ragged line, shaking white tipped poles at the walled town and shouting.Bareskins go down today!Jailers of poor natives!Wolmen break um free today!Bareskins Great Father lose um papooses!Its traditional, Dar explained.What?The way they talk?No, just the threats.Oh.Sam frowned.But that dialect!I can understand why theyd speak Terrese, but why the pidgin grammar and all those ums?Dar shrugged.Dont know, actually.Therere some of us have been wondering about that for a few years now.The best we can come up with is that they copped it from some stereotyped presentation of barbarians, probably in an entertainment form.Opposition cultures tend to be pretty romantic.The soldiers began to file out of the main gate, lining up a hundred yards away from the Wolmen in a precise line.Their bright green uniforms were immaculately clean, with knife edge creases; their boots gleamed, and their metal work glistened.They held their white tipped sticks at order arms, a precise forty five degree angle across their bodies.Shacklars big on morale, Dar explained.Each soldier gets a two BTU bonus if his boots are polished; another two if his uniforms clean; two more if its pressed; and so on.The soldiers muttered among themselves out of the corners of their mouths.Dar could catch the odd phrase:  Bloody Wolmen think they own the whole planet!Cant tell us what t do!They think they cn lord it over us, they got another think comin!Sam looked up at Dar, frowning.Whats that all about?It almost sounds as though they think the Wolmen are the government!They do.Dar grinned.Sam scanned the line of troops, frowning.Wherere their weapons?Weapons!Dar stared down at net scandalized.What do you think we area bunch of savages?But I thought you said this was a   BR R R R ANK!rolled a huge gong atop the wall, and the officers shouted, Charge!The Wolmen chiefs whooped, and their warriors leaped down toward the soldiers with piercing, ululating war cries.The soldiers shouted, and charged them.The two lines crashed together, and instantly broke into a chaotic melee, with everyone yelling and slashing about them with their sticks.This is civilized warfare?Sam watched the confusion numbly.Very, Dar answered.Theres none of this nonsense about killing or maiming, you see.I mean, were short enough on manpower as it is.Sam looked up at him, unbelieving.Then how do you tell whos won?The war sticks.Dar pointed.Theyve got lumps of very soft chalk in the ends.If you manage to touch your opponent with it, it leaves a huge white blotch on him.A soldier ran past, with a Wolman hot on his heels, whooping like a Saturday matinee.Suddenly the soldier dropped into a crouch, whirled about and slashed upward.The stick slashed across the Wolmans chest, leaving a long white streak.The Wolman skidded to a stop, staring down at his new badge, appalled.Then his face darkened, and he advanced toward the soldier, swinging his stick up.Every one loses his temper now and then, Dar murmured.A whistle shrilled, and a Terran officer came running up.All right, thatll do!You there, tribesmanyoure out of the war, plain as the chalk on your chest!On your way, now, or Ill call one o yer own officers.Oppressor of poor, ignorant savages!the Wolman stormed.We rise um up!We beat um you down!Ayuh, well, tomorrow, maybe.Move along to the sidelines, now, theres a good chap!The officer made shooing motions.The Wolman stood stiffly, face dark with rebellion.Then he threw down his chalk stick with a snarl and went stalking off toward a growing crowd of men, soldiers and Wolmen alike, standing off to the east, well clear of the battle.The officer nodded.Thats well done, then.And he ran off, back toward the thick of the melee.The soldier swaggered toward Dar; grinning and twirling his stick.Chalk up one more for the good guys, eh?And another ten BTUs in your account!Dar called back.Well done, soldier!The soldier grinned, waved, and charged back into the thick of the chaos.Ten credits?Sam gasped, blanching.You dont mean your General pays a bounty?No, of course not.I mean, its not the General who let himself get chalked up, is it?Its the Wolman who pays.What?Sure.After the battles over; the officersll transfer ten credits from that Wolmans account to the soldiers.I mean, theres got to be some risk involved.Right, she agreed.Sure.Risk.Her eyes had glazed.I, uh, notice the, uh, casualties seem to be having a pretty good time over there.Mm?Dar looked up at the group over to the east.Wolmen and soldiers were chatting amicably over tankards.A couple of privates and three warriors wove in and out through the crowd with trays of bottles and cups, dispensing cheer and collecting credits.He turned back to Sam.Why not?Gotta fill in the dead time somehow.Sure, she agreed.Why not?Suddenly whistles shrilled all over the field, and the frantic runners slowed to a walk, lowering their chalk sticks.Most of them looked pretty disgusted.Cease!bellowed one officer.Study war no more!echoed a Wolman chief.The combatants began to circulate; a hum of conversation swelled.Continual warfare, Sam muttered.Dar leaned back against the wall and began whistling through his teeth.Two resplendent figures stepped in from the westan I. D. E.  colonel in full dress uniform and a Wolman in a brightly patterned cloak and elaborate headdress.The top ranking officers, Dar explained.Also the peace commission.Referees?Sam muttered.Come again?Id rather not.Each officer singled out those of his own men who had chalk marks on them, but who hadnt retired to the sidelines.Most of them seemed genuinely surprised to find theyd been marked.A few seemed chagrined.The officers herded them over to join the beerfest, then barked out orders, and the casualties lined up according to side in two ragged lines, still slurping beer.The officers walked down each others line, counting heads, then switched and counted their own lines.Then they met and discussed the situation.Me count um twenty nine of mine, and thirty two of yours.Came to the same count, old chap.Wouldnt debate it a bit.The Wolman grinned, extending a palm.Pay up.The I. D. E.  colonel sighed, pulled out a pad, and scribbled a voucher.The Wolman pocketed it, grinning.A lieutenant and a minor Wolman stepped up from the battlefield, each holding out a sheaf of papers.The two chief officers took them and shuffled through, muttering to each other, comparing claims.Thats the lot.The colonel tapped his sheaf into order, squaring it off.Only this one discrepancy, on top here.The Wolman nodded.Me got same.Well, lets check it, then  OSchwarzkopf!Sir!A corporal stepped forward and came to attention with a click of his heels, managing not to spill his tankard in the process.This warrior, um, Xlitplox, claims he chalked you.Valid?Valid, sir.Xlitplox!the Wolman officer barked.Me here.The Wolman stepped forward, sipping.OSchwarzkopf claim um him chalk you.He do um.Xlitplox nodded.Could be collusion, the colonel noted.The Wolman shrugged.What matter?Cancel um out, anyhow.Null score.The colonel nodded.They want to trade tenners, thats their business.Well!He tapped the sheaf and saluted the Wolman with them.Ill have these to the bank directly.Me go um, too.The Wolman caught two tankards from a passing tray and dropped a chit on it.Drink?Dont mind if I do.The colonel accepted a tankard and lifted it.To the revolution!Was hael!The Wolman clinked mugs with him.We rise um up; we break um and bury um corrupt colonial government!And well destroy the Wolman tyranny!Your health.Yours, the Wolman agreed, and they drank.What is this?Sam rounded on Dar Whos rebelling against whom?Depends on whom you ask.Makes sense, doesnt it?I mean, each side claims to be the rightful government of the whole planetso each side also thinks its staging a revolution.Thats asinine!Anybody can see the Wolmen are the rightful owners of the planet.Why?They didnt evolve here, any more than we soldiers did.How do you know?Sam sneered.Because I read a history book.The Wolmen are the descendants of the Tonies, the last big opposition culture, a hundred years ago.You should hear their musictwenty four tones.They came out here to get away from technology.Sam shuddered, then shook her head.That doesnt really change anything.They were here first.Sure, but they think we came in and took over.After all, weve got a government.Their idea of politics is everybody sitting around in a circle and arguing until they can all agree on something.Sounds heavenly, Sam murmured, eyes losing focus.Maybe, but that still leaves General Shacklar as the only government strong enough to rebel againstat least, the way the Wolmen see it.And we think theyre trying to tell us what to doso were revolting, too.No argument there.Sam shrugged.I suppose I shouldnt gripe.As continual wars go, this is pretty healthy.Yeah, especially when you think of what it was like my first two years here.What?Real warwith sticks and stones?Dar frowned.When you tie the stone to the end of the stick, it can kill a manand it did.I saw a lot of soldiers lying on the ground with their heads bashed in and their blood soaking into the weeds.I saw more with stone tipped spears and arrows in them.Our casualties were very messy.So what are dead Wolmen likepretty?I was beginning to think so, back then.Dar grimaced at the memory.But dead Wolmen were almost antisepticjust a neat little hole drilled into em.Not even any bloodlaser wounds are cauterized.Sam caught at his arm, looking queasy.All right!Thats  enough!Dar stared down at her.Sorry.Didnt think Id been all that vivid.Ive got a good imagination.Sam pushed against him, righting herself.How old were you then?Eighteen.Yeah, it made me sick too.Everybody was.But they couldnt figure out how to stop it?Of course not.Then Shacklar was assigned the command.Whatd he dotalk it to death?Dar frowned.Howd you guess?I was kidding.You cant stop a war by talking!Dar shrugged.Maybe he waved a magic wand.All I knew was that he had the Wolmen talking instead of fighting.How, I dont knowbut he finally managed to get them to sign a treaty agreeing to this style of war.Would it surprise you to learn the mans just human?Its hard to remember sometimes, Dar admitted.As far as Im concerned, Shacklar can do no wrong.I take it all the rest of the soldiers feel the same way.Dar nodded.Make snide comments about the Secretary of the Navy, if you want.Sneer at the General Secretary of the whole Interstellar Dominion Electorates.Maybe even joke about God.But dont you dare say a word against General Shacklar!Sam put on a nasty smile and started to say something.Then she thought better of it, her mouth still open.After a second, she closed it.I suppose a person could really get into trouble that way here.What size trouble would you like?Standard measurements here are two feet wide, six feet long, and six feet down.No man should have that kind of power!Power?He doesnt even give orders!He just asks   Yeah, and you soldiers fall all over each other trying to see who can obey first!Thats obscene!Dar bridled.Soldiers are supposed to be obscene.Sexual stereotype, Sam snapped.Its absurd.Okayso soldiers should be obscene and not absurd.Dar gave her a wicked grin.But wouldnt you feel that way about a man whod saved your life, not to mention your face?My face doesnt need saving, thank you!Dar decided to keep his opinions to himself.Looktherere only two ways to stop a war.Somebody can winand that wasnt happening here.Or you can find some way to save face on both sides.Shacklar did.Ill take your word for it.Sam looked more convinced than she sounded.The main point is, hes found a way to let off the steam that comes from the collision of two cultures.Dar nodded.His way also sublimates all sorts of drives very nicely.Sam looked up, frowning.Yes, it would.But you cant claim he planned it that way.Sure I can.Didnt you know?Shacklars a psychiatrist.Psychiatrist?Sure.By accident, the Navy assigned a man with the right background to be warden for a prison planet.I mean, any soldier whos sent here probably has a mental problem of some sort.And if he doesnt, half an hour here should do the trick.But Shacklars a masochist!Who else could survive in a job like this?Dar looked around, surveying the battlefield.Things have quieted down enough.Lets go.He shouldered the rope and trudged off across the plain.Sam stayed a moment, then followed, brooding.She caught up with him.I hate to admit itbut youve really scrambled my brains.Dar looked up, surprised.No offense taken.None intended.In fact, it was more like a confession.Oha compliment.You had us pegged wrong, huh?Thanks for not rubbing it in, she groused.And dont start crowing too soon.Im not saying I was wrong, yet.But, well, lets say its not what I expected.What did you expect?The dregs of society, she snapped.Well, we are now.I mean, thats just a matter of definition, isnt it?If youre in prison, youre the lowest form of social life.But people are supposed to go to prison because theyre the lowest of the low!Supposed to, maybe.Might even have been that way, once.But now?You can get sent here just for being in the wrong place at the wrong time.Isnt that stretching it?No.Dars mouth tightened at the corners.Believe me, its not.Convince me.Look, Dar said evenly, on a prison planet, one thing you dont do is ask anybody why hes there.I figured that much.Sam gazed at him, very intently.Im asking.Dars face went blank, and his jaw tightened.After a few seconds, he took a deep breath.Okay.Not me, lets sayjust someone I know.All right?Anything you say, Sam murmured.Dar marched along in silence for a few minutes.Then he said, Call him George.Sam nodded.George was a nice young kid.You know, good parents, lived in a nice small town with good schools, never got into any real trouble.But he got bored with school, and dropped out.And got drafted?Nothe young idiot enlisted.And, since he had absolutely no training or experience in cargo handling, bookkeeping, or stocking, of course he was assigned to the Quartermasters Corps.Which is where you met him?You could say that.Anyway, they made him a cargo handlertaught him how to pilot a small space tugand he had a whale of a time, jockeying cargo off shuttles and onto starships.Figured he was a hotshot Navy pilot, all that stuff.I thought he was in the Army.Even the Army has to run a few ships.Anyway, it was a great job, but after a while it got boring.Sam closed her eyes.He wanted a change.Right, Dar said sourly.So he applied for promotionand they made him into a stock clerk.He began to go crazy, just walking around all day, making sure the robots had put the right items into the right boxes and the right boxes into the right binsespecially since they rarely took anything out of those bins, or put in anything new.And he heard the stories in the mess about how even generals have to be very nice to the sergeants in charge of the routing computers, or the goods they order will accidently get shipped halfway across the Sphere.Sounds important.It does, when youre a teenager.So George decided he was going to get promoted again.Well, thats the way its supposed to be, Sam said quietly.The young mans supposed to find himself in the Army, and study and work hard to make something better out of himself.Sure, Dar said sourly.Well, George did.He knew a little about data processing, of course, but just the basics they make you learn in school.Hed dropped out before hed learned anything really usefulso now he learned it.You know, night classes, studying three hours a day, the rest of it.And it workedhe passed the test, and made corporal.Everythings fine so far.They assign him a computer terminal?Dar nodded.And for a few months, he just did what he was told, punched in the numbers he was given.By the end of the first month, he knew the computer codes for every single Army platoon and every single Navy ship by heart.By the end of the second month, he knew all their standard locations.And by the end of the third month, hed begun to realize this wasnt much better than stocking shelves?You got it.Then, one day, the sergeant handed him some numbers that didnt make sense.Hed been on the job long enough to recognize themthe goods number was for a giant heating system, and the destination code was for Betelgeuse Gamma.Betelgeuse Gamma?Sam frowned.I think that one went across my desk once.Isnt it a jungle world?Dar nodded.
