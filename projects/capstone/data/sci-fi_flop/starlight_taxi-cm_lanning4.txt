Sorry Chris, I was in the shower at the time, the driver said.I have told you repeatedly to call me Mr.Thompson, Chris said.Sorry, Chris.I get nothing but attitude from you even after all Ive done.Youre a piece of work.Chris.Im on my way into the hub, and Im really early this time.Stop riding my ass.You cant afford the fare, the driver said.That is no way to talk to your boss!Ive worked for your slave driving self for 25 years, Chris.When I consider you my boss, Ill let you know, the driver said, chuckling.Just get your smart ass to the Central Mall in Citeria on Saturn!Your client will be an older gentleman wearing a suit and sitting on a bench outside of the restaurant circle.Marty would do it, but he took off an hour early due to feeling sick, Chris said.Working the assignments switchboard today?Where is Pattie?She is out sick, and I dont have a replacement coming in for a couple of hours, Chris said.Well shoot, Chris.You might actually have two hours of work on your time card this week, the driver said, laughing.Listen here, asshole!If you arent at that mall in three hours, youll be working double shifts all weekend, Chris yelled.Now you and I both know you wont do that.Your budget wouldnt allow for all the overtime, the driver said.A loud click was heard in the drivers ear.Old man has quite a temper.I love getting him riled up, the driver said, laughing.Solstice looked up at him from the passenger seat.Oh come on.Any blood pressure issues he has are on him.It isnt my fault if he gets carried away, the driver said.She sneezed and went back to sleep.Dont you get an attitude with me, missy!Dealing with the old man is bad enough, the driver said, his hand slowly reaching for the pocket of his green button down shirt.His fingers pulled out a cigarette cautiously and put it in his mouth.Then, he quietly pulled out a lighter, glancing over at the husky.As soon as he clicked it, her ears perked up, and she sat upright and howled incessantly.It was loud and hurt the drivers ears.Okay!Okay!I wont even light it, you dumb animal.He mashed the unused cigarette into the ashtray grumpily and continued on his way to Saturn, hopping on Intergalactic Road 33.There were a large number of truckers on the road with him, which didnt surprise the driver one bit.He didnt like driving next to large trucks, but it couldnt be helped.Saturn had been terraformed into a plant haven.There were forests, jungles, and rainforests all over the planet, and wood was the number one number one export.Scientists had spent decades working to terraform the planet, stabilizing the atmosphere, installing several satellites to act as miniature artificial suns, and even making the surface suitable for plant life.It truly was incredible what space exploration had done over time.Engineers took a planet that had an average temperature of  280 degrees and brought that temperature up to make the planet more like that of Earth.That was all above the drivers head, though.He just drove a car through space and took people where they needed to go.And now, hed added the responsibility of feeding a dog to his list.Solstice got up and stretched as Starla came down into the atmosphere of Saturn.The driver was in the southern hemisphere of Saturn below the ring and heading for the biggest city on the forest covered planet.He flew above the trees staying out of the way of truckers loading up lumber and taking it to various destinations for high fees.After about 30 minutes, the driver came to one of the few parts of the planet where the trees vanished and were replaced by skyscrapers.Welcome to Citeria, Solstice, the driver said, scratching the side of her head.Geez, its been a few months since Ive picked up anyone here, the driver thought to himself as he found his way through busy streets and made it to the mall.He drove around the mall a couple times before finding the restaurant circle.It was a newer part of the complex that wasnt here the last time he picked up a client at the Central Mall.Theyd made the mall even bigger, included a few dozen more stores, and added nine new parking lots.There really is a lot of money in Citeria because of timer exports, the driver muttered, looking around at the four story mall before him.White flowers lined the sidewalk he parked next to after he spotted an old man in a suit on a bench a few feet behind the mulch where the plants were.It was covered in shade provided by a small urban type tree, the kind cities usually plant along sidewalks to look nice.The elderly man appeared to be in his 70s and was balding.He still had some white hair growing on the sides and rear of his skull, though.He had a long wild white beard that matched the color his hair.The driver got out of Starla and walked around to open the door for him.The man was carrying a small potted tree in one hand and a small brown satchel in the other.Can I put one of those in my vehicle for you?No.I have them, the man said, firmly.The driver didnt judge his tone to be rude.He was just very direct.The driver had taken enough passengers across the galaxy to know the difference.This mans tone wasnt intentionally rough; it was just stiff because he didnt beat around the bush, even slightly.He muttered a quiet word of thanks to the driver for coming to open the door for him.Not a problem, the driver said.He didnt mind helping out polite customers.It was the rude ones he told to go to Hell.Hed done that a few times, and Chris had taken the cost of fuel for those trips out of the drivers paychecks.It was worth it eating nothing but canned soup and cheap frozen pizzas for a week to tell those assholes off, the driver thought.The elderly man did not let the driver close the door.He did it himself, and that made the driver smirk as he walked back around to get into Starla.As he closed the door, he saw Solstice sitting up and turned around, sniffing in general at the old man.She kept her distance, but the driver could tell she was curious about the plant he carried.I dont mind your animal being in the cab, but please be sure she stays in the front seat.I dont want her hopping back here, the man said.Dont worry.In dog years, shes about as old as you are.She aint doing any hopping.Solstice, lie down, the driver said.She did as she was told and dozed off a few minutes later.The driver looked back at the elderly man and asked, Where am I taking you?The old man handed me a business card.Ralph Timaka?My home address is on that card.I want you to take me there, the man said, looking down at his plant.Sure thing, the driver said, heading out of Citeria and looking for the nearest place he could pop back up through the atmosphere and get on an intergalactic road.Finally finding a spot he could head out of, he gunned Starla to get ahead of a few space freighters carrying lumber and hopped onto Intergalactic Road 27, heading back toward Earth.The old man lived on the outskirts of Kyoto.The driver didnt think the old man was Asian, but it wasnt like one had to be in order to live in that part of the world.The drivers client actually had pretty tan skin and strong hands with some blisters on them.He clearly worked outside.Quite an interesting plant you have there, the driver said, testing the waters to see if Ralph wanted to talk.Ralphs demeanor immediately changed when the topic of his plant came up.Its a bonsai tree.Have you not seen one before?Maybe in an old movie...looks kind of small for a tree, the driver said.Yeah, and your car looks sort of old to have made that maneuver in front of the freighters back there.Looks can be deceiving, Ralph said.The drivers right eye twitched at the insult to Starla, but the driver had unwittingly insulted the mans tree.You have a garden youre going to put it in?A nursery actually, Ive been growing these trees all my life.I have lots of a land near Kyoto that I grow these trees on, Ralph said.Wow...so has that been your occupation for your life?It has.I used to sell these plants all over the galaxy since they could only be grown on Earth.Even if a planet was terraformed to sustain other plants, these trees never seemed to make it.I was quite proud of my trees, Ralph said.The driver wanted a cigarette, but he didnt want to get Solstice upset and howling again.Damn dog, the driver thought, his nicotine craving starting to nag him.Seems like itd be hard to make a living selling trees, the driver said, looking back at Ralph in his rearview mirror.Well sure, if youre a nobody its hard.My trees are the finest south of Tokyo.I dont sell many anymore, though.I mostly teach people how to grow them now, Ralph said.Did you grow that one?I did.Its the first one to be grown on Saturn.Its a couple years old, and Ive decided to take it back to Earth to see if it can survive in the homeland of its ancestors, Ralph said.The two continued to talk trees, which surprisingly was more interesting than the driver anticipated.Then again, it wasnt the trees he found interesting.It was the man who grew them for a living.He was particularly peculiar, and the driver began to like him somewhat.Hed grown trees for actors, politicians, and some all around very important people.In the plant world, this guy was pretty famous.As they approached Earth, Ralph said, You sure seem interested in my trees and life.Do you moonlight as a reporter?The driver chuckled and said, No.My hobby is just getting to know intriguing passengers.Do you write stories about them or something?No.I just remember them.Its one of my favorite things about this job, the driver said.If you say so, Ralph said.No wedding ring...does your girlfriend like you driving all over the galaxy throughout the day?Sorry to disappoint, but Im single.Family?Orphan.Damn.Im zero for two on those depressing subjects, Ralph said.The driver smirked and said, Its fine.I dont regret my situation.Besides, Im thinking of going to visit a girl pretty soon anyway.Oh?Whats she like?The driver pulled up to Ralphs nursery and got out to open the door for him.Ralphs house was an older Japanese style home.It was raised off the ground a little, made mostly of wood, and even had a sliding door entrance.His back yard was surrounded by a metal fence and ran up a hill that was full of bonsai trees.Ralph paid the driver and actually tipped him.Thanks, the driver said, leaning into the car and getting his tree for him.Ralph took it and said, You didnt answer my question about the girl.Whats she like?The driver closed Starlas door and walked back around to the drivers seat.Before he got in, he looked at Ralph and said, Shes a bartender on Europa.6: One Sick Dog  The stars were blurring for the 75th time as the driver brought Starla back home toward Earth.His breathing was erratic, and his stomach felt horrible.Everything was sore for an inexplicable reason.He just needed to get home and get to bed.Bed would make everything better.Ill sleep it off like I always do, the driver whispered.Solstice was watching him like a hawk.She could sense all was not well for her friend.It was stupid really.He had taken one day off to go visit a bartender that he had picked up on Europa once before.She seemed interested in him, and he thought, What the Hell?It couldnt hurt to take her up on her offer and visit.He started feeling funny just past Mars...and not in a good way.The driver was never one to take drugs, but he was a drinker on occasion.He got free rides from Starlight Taxi, so, that made the perfect designated driver.As Starla entered the atmosphere and swerved slightly from side to side, she somehow found the highway that led to Lefont.The drivers dull reaction time actually caused Starla to skid a little on the cement of his driveway.In between wheezing, he stopped Starla, got out, and stood on unsteady legs.Solstice, ever the faithful red husky, hopped out and walked backwards slowly to lead the driver to the front door of his small townhouse.His neighbor Travis was out mowing the lawn and saw the driver stumbling.He stopped his mower and walked over to the short metal black fence that separated his yard from the drivers property.You okay, neighbor?The driver looked up, forcing his vision to focus for a second.He saw his neighbor with a concerned look on his face.Travis was wearing some sort of jungle explorer outfit.Ill never understand that guy, the driver thought.Im good...just need to get some sleep, the driver said, raising his hand slowly to wave.If you say so.Want me to have Krickett make some soup and bring it over later?No...thanks.Just need...snooze, the driver said, stumbling forward.His steps from the door to his bed were a blur, but he collapsed on the black futon in his bedroom without even transforming it into a bed.He coughed as he tried to doze off, but he was burning up.Damn...air on, set to 68 degrees, the driver yelled.He felt his air kick on as he slipped off his red canvas shoes and slowly reached up to pull his earpiece off his head and throw it on the floor.Hed need no disturbances tonight if he was going to work tomorrow.His stomach just felt more and more nauseous, and his mind refused to quit thinking about random things...movies...what hed read in the newspaper earlier in the day...details about some of his clients.His mind wandered aimlessly, Wasnt there an old man...and a tree?Then, as he wished, his mind stopped, and he passed out.A falling feeling engulfed the driver as he landed in a pond.He looked around to see where he was as he swam to shore and tried to brush some algae off of him.No one appeared to notice his falling, but the driver had no idea where he was.Slowly, as though a parting fog lifted from his memory, he realized his exact location...the Lieutenant Richard B.  Ridick Park in Dallas.How the Hell did I get here?He looked around.It was a cloudy winter day, which was odd because when the driver fell asleep it was...spring?Man, I must have been more messed up than I thought when I hit the bed.I dont even remember getting up, let alone...coming to Dallas, the driver said, scratching his head.His hat was missing, and his keys and wallet were also gone.His wet shoes squeaked as he walked over toward a large man standing at the shore of an even bigger pond.Before he made it halfway to the big guy, someone ran right through the driver.What the Hell?He looked down at himself and touched his stomach.He felt his wet gray long sleeve t shirt.The kid running away from him was actually a teen, the driver realized, but that wasnt what scared him.What scared the driver was he recognized the teen.That hat...it belongs to my grandfather, the driver muttered.His familiar brown pub hat was given to him by the first orphanage he stayed in.They told him it belonged to his grandfather who dropped him off.It was the one thing he kept with him all the time.Then, he remembered this cold winter day.The adolescent running at the fat man ahead was 16, and the driver knew exactly what was about to happen to the teen.He watched it unfold as the fat man turned around with one lightning quick motion and stopped the kid from grabbing his wallet.He then flipped the teen over in the grass and went back to his hobby.Him and those ducks, the driver muttered, walking over.This must be some sort of dream, the driver thought.He listened to the fat man laugh as the teen growled and held his head in his hands, still not getting up.Whatd you do that for, you stupid fat man?Whatd I do that for?You were trying to steal my wallet you little pissant!Youre lucky I didnt throw you into the pond with the ducks!The two continued to fight, and eventually, the teen settled down as the larger man continued to feed a group of Mallard ducks from the loaf of bread by his feet.Why are you feeding those stupid things?What a waste of food, the teen muttered.Should I instead use my food to feed horrible thieves that attempt to rob me of my wallet?Feeding these ducks makes me happy.I feel peaceful.What would I get out of feeding a hungry turd like you?The teens stomach growled so loud that the driver could hear it clear across the park.He got up to walk away when the fat man turned and tossed him a slice of bread.The teen caught it and immediately tore it to pieces, wolfing it down.Ill buy you dinner on two conditions, brat.The teen hated being called a brat, but his pride was too weak having been starved over the past couple days.Name them.You wait patiently and quietly while I finish feeding the ducks, and you have to take back calling me fat, the man said, turning to the kid.The driver smirked.This guy had lots of class, even if he was a tightass.His short black hair and graying stubble were all too familiar to the driver, but the teen was seeing him for the first time.What do I call you then?Ugly beard man doesnt have quite as nice of a ring, the teen said, laughing.You can call me Chris, you weird hat wearing freak.The teen said nothing but kept up the first condition of the bargain while he waited for his meal.Chris fed the ducks for another five minutes while he emptied his bag of bread.The teen held his end of the bargain and said nothing.He really needed the food.Im impressed.Even a dumb failed thief like you can keep a bargain.Come on, I know a good burger cart.You like bacon cheeseburgers?I like food that keeps me from starving, the teen shrugged.The driver watched them disappear as he felt that falling feeling again.This time, instead of falling into a pond, he fell onto a green carpeted floor.He moaned and felt his forehead.It was burning up, and even a simple space cab driver like him knew that was bad.Solstice was at his side, licking his face and trying to get him up.He struggled to move, but his body responded sluggishly.Where is my.
