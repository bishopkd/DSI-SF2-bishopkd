Ruby sat on the edge of the bed, as silent and still as possible.Now, more than ever before, she felt all of the generations that had been born and died in The Creative Fire.Their work, their hope, their dreams, and their pain seemed to float around Ruby like a fog of intent.Joels quiet breath filled the room, punctuated with the creaks and groans of the great ship around her, the sigh of machinery that filled the space inside with air and delivered water to grow food, to drink, and to clean.Living so near the center not only sounded different, but it felt different; as if the entire mass of The Creative Fire centered here on Joels room.On their room.It was their room, and she would stay in it.She would share his power, and she would do it well.She had earned it.She would find a way to fit here.Beside her, Joel rolled over and stretched.She put a hand on his shoulder, kneading softly to work at his stiff muscles.As her fingers worked, Joels breath lost the even rhythm of sleep.He pushed himself up on his elbow.You might as well be pacing.I can feel the ship around me.At home, she gestured outward, toward the working habitats, at home there would be robots going by and children laughing and bells for shift change.Isnt your home here now?Of course.The tone of her whisper was a caress to match the hand that trailed along his back.You worked out hard yesterday.Winning has given me more enemies.He touched her hair, stroking it.You have them, too.You should start working with KJ again.Its been five weeks since the last actual fighting.Get back into routines.Ill send two guards with you.Ruby laughed.No guards.He turned her face toward his.Its not a request.You dont know who hates you yet.Its a risk of being with me.Ill take friends.Like Ani and Dayn.Good thing there isnt a stubborn bone in your body.Or yours.She fell back onto the bed against him.Ix!Yes, Ruby.The ships AI chose a soft female voice.Bring up the Adiamo system.She loved having a display in the bedroom.A luxurious manifestation of Joels power as captain of The Creative Fire.The screen sprang to life, presenting a view of a single brilliant sun with two gas giants, and cradled between, two inhabited planets.Tiny lights blinked for the orbiting space stations.Is that real yet?she asked Ix.Its still the game view.I can see the sun, Adiamo, but we arent close enough for the cameras to pick up planets or stations.She frowned and whispered into Joels ear.What are we going to find there?One hand roamed her torso.Our home.Our destiny.She closed her eyes.Change.She loved change, she had made change, created it with all of her being.So why did she feel so unprepared?2     Onor had to work around small crowds in the park on B pod as he searched for Marcelle.He finally spotted her walking so fast it was nearly a jog, her dark curly hair bouncing against the shoulders of her blue uniform shirt.Onors face broke into a grin he wasnt really expecting.After all, it had only been a few weeks since theyd last been on a patrol together.She sped up and reached him, smelling like sweat and stim, and punched him in the arm.Long time.Not so long.Long if youre me.He shook his head at her.Joel wants a report about how dangerous it is out here.And you?Wanted to say hi to you.Thats better.He felt awkward around her even though she was his next to oldest friend.The fighting had changed everything.The different places theyd all ended up had changed them more.The three of them had been inseparable once, but now he was standing next to Marcelle for the first time in weeks.You could live near us.Rubys offered to find you work in command.She needs me out here more.Someone has to remind people Ruby cares about them.Shell be doing that herself today or tomorrow.I overheard her and Joel talking about it.Good.Marcelle plucked at his sleeve.Lets go.Something above them groaned and the floor gave a slight shudder.Marcelle stopped and turned to look at him.The Fire knows shes going home, she whispered.Only I dont think she wants to get there.Onor laughed louder than he meant to.Well, Marcelle started walking again.She seems to be falling apart a little more every day.Well make it.Too bad Im almost the only gray who believes you.There are no grays.Being able to wear blue and red doesnt make people forget who they really are.Do you really believe that?he asked her.Isnt it better now?You are so nave, Onor Hall.They hit the end of a corridor and Marcelle consulted her journal, sending them left.She stopped and he ran up against her, her back and shoulder suddenly tucked into his body.Warm.She whispered, How long until we get there?You should know.I dont.He forced himself to step slightly back.Doesnt Joel tell you anything?Or Ruby?A slight edge in her voice made him wince.No one knows, he replied.We know how far away Adiamo is, and Ix is working on calculating the other orbits now that its found one of the gas giants.Were close enough for Ix to see the planets?Just Mammot so far.Not Lym.So well get home this year?Ix will tell us when it knows.Im as anxious as you are to see a sky.I cant imagine it.Nothing above you.What does nothing look like?He laughed.I have no idea.Youre infuriating.If I knew when wed get home, Id tell you.She stopped right in front of him, blocking his way.Really?Yes.Good.Be quiet.Were getting near the danger zone.For the next hour, they patrolled as silently as they could.They noted a pile of debris and Onor pulled out his journal and called a cleaning bot for it, but nothing more eventful happened until they slid out of the maintenance corridors and into the B pod maintenance galley.Ruby sat in a chair, a half full cup of water in her hand.There you are.Shed been waiting for them.She wore a flowing green shirt over gray pants and low heeled gray boots.Her red hair had been pulled back from her face and braided on top of her head, the back left flowing over her shoulders.She looked so beautiful that he felt awkward, his cheeks hot and his tongue tied.The worst of it was that he felt sure she knew what her simple presence did to him.Ruby rose and gave Marcelle a long hug.He and Marcelle both waiting for Ruby to speak.Ive got a few hours before I promised to be in common.Joel said you wouldnt be here for a few days.Ruby ignored his comment.Ix told me where you two were, and I thought we could be together for a bit.She looked from Onor to Marcelle and back.I miss how it used to be.Can you tell me how things are out here?Marcelle started talking so he sat back to listen.Its fractured.The Jackman and Conroy rousted a whole cell of true reds yesterdayI think there were seven of them.Theyre in lockup.But we didnt see any trouble today.The living areas feel more normal.Most of the repair and maintenance shops are back up.Ruby looked pleased.Does it feel better?You knowsafer?Marcelle got up and poured two cups of water.We lock the reds up now.Thats better than them locking us up.She set the two glasses of water down, making a little show of taking care of Onor.But its hard to tell who to trust.Ruby leaned in and whispered, Will you keep it secret that Im here?Before they could answer, the door opened.The boy Haric led a much older man in behind him.Ben.Ben looked older than Onor remembered.His eyes were almost buried in shadowed cracks, his face framed with wispy gray hair.He moved stiffly.This man wouldnt be able to chase recalcitrant children through corridors and force them to go home.He still dressed in red, though.Bens only concession to the new order was that he wore the multi colored necklace Ruby had beaded him right on top of his shirt where everybody could see it.He stood for a bit, looking at Ruby curiously.Good to see youre safe.Ruby took his hand, and kissed it.You kept me that way for years.Her voice sounded thick, almost choked.Haric pulled a chair out for Ben and waited until the old man sat down before he looked at Ruby.Thank you, she told him.See you in common in an hour.Haric looked disappointed at the dismissal, but he obeyed.After the door shut behind him, Ruby leaned over Ben, giving him a hug.Can I get you anything?No.Ben looked pleased and awkward in Rubys arms.Im glad you got my message.She poured him water anyway.I wasnt sure Haric could find you.He found me yesterday.I was overseeing a group of teenagers in E pod, and it took a while to get here on the train.Im sorry.We havent got them all repaired yet, Ruby said.What do you need to tell me?Ben gave a her a long, hard look that reminded her of how he used to look at her when she was a child.Like she was being reckless.You should have more bodyguards with you.Ive got Onor.Not true.Shed gotten here by herself.You never did listen.Ben shook his head, his eyes unfocused in remembrance.Not one day.But youve got to be more careful than you used to be.Surely Im safe here, Ruby said.Ben leaned in toward her.That short blue, Ellis, hes trying to make trouble for you for sure.Hes stayed true.Sylvas stayed true, too.Shes as red as my hair, and a bitch besides.So you know this?Youre watching for it?Ben asked.That some of us might be out to hurt you?Grays?My own people?Ben dropped his eyes, like he didnt want to tell her any more.Lya.Shes recruiting women and getting them to hate you.And Ellis and Sylva have a few, at least.Ruby worried her lower lip.I didnt know they were recruiting grays.I dont know how many, Ben said.Or exactly who.Rubys eyes widened and she spat out, Joel.What about Joel?Do they intend to hurt him?I expect so.Do you know about any plans?Nothing specific.Ill watch for you, let you know.I want you to tell Joel, too.I couldnt get a message to him.Did you try?Hes surrounded by keepers these days.Ruby gave a soft smile.Ive not taken good care of you.Ill see that Joel meets you and knows all you did.Oh, I know Joel well.That made Onor curious, but he didnt want to interrupt.Besides, this was their lunch break, and he was hungry.He turned to open the refrigerator, half listening as Ruby chattered with Ben and Marcelle about less critical things like her songs (yes, she was writing new ones) and her mother Siri (who loved Rubys power and tried to take credit for it).Onor found two orbfruit a bit past their prime, and some stale bread.He peeled the fruit and put the bright yellow orange slices right on the bread to soften it, then rummaged in the cupboard for stim.The whole conversation felt surreal.If the world were the old way, Ben would be chasing them instead of bringing warnings.How had Ruby gotten away by herself anyway?Clearly shed come here to meet Ben.As they finished, Ruby said, Ive got to go.Either of you coming to hear me?I am, Onor said.Me, too, Marcelle added.Good.Shed have both of them for protection.Ruby cocked her head at Ben.Will you come, too?No.Ben pushed himself up from the table.Ive got to start back.Im on patrol tomorrow.All right.Stay safe.Its not me Im worried about.Ruby gave him yet another hug, as if she were starved for it.They fell silent until the door closed.I bet hes lonely, Marcelle said.It must be tough to be an old red and have to patrol for groups of true reds or true blues.At least he and Marcelle hunted old enemies and not old friends.3     Even though shed only leaked her impending visit an hour ago, common was nearly full of people, and someone had found multi colored ribbons to decorate the doorways with.Ruby remembered many of the faces in the crowded room from training or battles or concerts, or from the victory party.A plump woman put a hand out to touch Rubys shoulder, her eyes puffy and red with tears.What happened?Ruby asked her.My ...my brother died.In the fighting.Seeing you reminds me of what he died for.For all of us.Ruby leaned in and held her, appreciating her solid form.He was brave.Im sorry.A nod.And your name?Louisa.The woman lifted up a hand, and held out a necklace with blue and red and gray beads on it.Ruby slid the necklace over her head, on top of three others.As she said, Thank you, she focused on Louisas face, tried to memorize the way her eyes were set wide over a full mouth.Her right incisor was missing.She would try to remember them all.These were her supporters, and the backbone of The Creative Fire.The people who planted and fixed and fed and cleaned.The next person who stopped her was a dark haired girl as thin as Marcelle but with straighter hair and a wide scar across her nose, the edges still puckered and slightly pink.Her name came to Ruby from some deep haze of memory.Hello Min.How did you get that?She pointed to the scar, which marred a natural beauty.I fought for you.This is from a knife.Mins voice held pride and determination, and her chin was high and her shoulders squared off.They tried to cut my throat.Im glad they missed, Ruby said, trying to keep it light.Min responded with a laugh.Me, too.She looked hungry for something, but Ruby couldnt tell what.Can I help you?Ruby asked.Min hesitated.I dont know.Will you tell me if you think of anything?Yes.Then a man Ruby knew from logistics, Harold, took her hand and she turned away from Min.He grinned at her like an old friend.Not that she had ever seen him without his smileit was part of him.He gave her a thumbs up, dropped another necklace over her head, and faded aside to let her through.As she climbed up onto the stage, she spotted her aunt Daria watching the crowd.Daria gave Ruby a brief hug and pushed her to the edge of the stage.Ruby raised her hands above her head and stood still, waiting.My friends.My family.They began to call out the names of songs.Thank you, she yelled over the noise.Thank you all.She stood with her hands clasped in front of her until the crowd quieted.Thank you, she repeated.You helped win this fight.You gave us all more freedom.You supported Joel and you supported me.More clapping came at her like a wave.She stayed silent until they quieted, a slow process that seemed to ripple outward from her to the back of the room.Im glad to see you.People kept calling out the names of her songs.A small disturbance at the back of the room caught her attention, and she noticed Onor escorting someone out the door.She couldnt see the face of the person, or even tell if it was a man or a woman.Onor had become efficient.Marcelle stalked the opposite side of the room from Onor, effective, driven, and bouncy as ever.If it hadnt been the wrong moment to do it, Ruby would have burst out in happy laughter.They were all together again.She had been going to say she needed to talk more than sing, but clearly the crowd wanted song.She closed her eyes and imagined her voice, strong and loud.Homecoming bubbled up in her and she started the first verse with no musical accompaniment.Long and dark is our night flight No stars shine inside Fires skin, only Me and you.And love.Were going home By the time the last bits of the song faded away, the crowd looked calmer.Children perched on their parents hips and people had moved closer, like just the one song had driven them together.They needed this, needed unity.It was the best gift she could give Joel, the best reward for his love.The support of her people.We are all one, she said.Everyone on the Fire is going home.We will get there soon.A week, a month, a year.Two years.We dont know.We can use the time between now and then to heal and to learn about each other.Were not separate anymore.If Joel can love me, if Joel can work to liberate you, then we are one ship.If everyone believed this, it would be so.She took a single step back, lifting her arms.The crowd cheered.We are one.They cheered again.Onor and Daria and Haric and Marcelle paced the edges, clapping and watching, and from time to time stopping to have brief conversations.It felt like a dance.Someone in the crowd called out, Sing the Owls Song.She shook her head, pleased even though she refused.This is not a time for a funeral song.It is a time for happiness.She sang two traditionals, one about working and another about the stars.During the second one, she realized it must be from before the journey, a song from home.After all, there was no way to see stars inside the Fire.She lowered her voice so far that the sound of others singing rose above it, so the experience became a group bonding more than a concert.Two hours passed before the crowd began to fidget between songs and the mothers of toddlers started to sneak away with unruly children.She ended the session the way she had opened it, with the chorus of Homecoming.She stood on the end of the stage, looking out, wishing she could hold the moment longer.Thank you.They began clapping.She stepped back, and then back again, and only then did the noise begin to dim and shift to the sounds of feet moving and whispered conversations between friends and family.A small group of admirers caught Ruby at the end of the stage and held her there to answer questions while the rest of the room emptied.Haric stuck by her side, watching her, trying so hard to be like Onor that it made her smile.A mother with five year old twin girls stayed behind to ask Ruby, How safe will it be at ...Adiamo.Home?What kind of welcome will we get?Im sure theyre looking forward to seeing us, just like were looking forward to getting home.Ix says the Adiamo system is a lot like the game.I want to live on Lym, one of the girls said.Ruby smiled.Perhaps we will.In the meantime, it cant hurt for you to play Adiamo a little more.Learn more details.The child gave a sweet, solemn nod.I want to be like you, she added.Well, you can sing anywhere.The woman pulled her offspring closer to her.There was a touch of fear in her eyes, even if none of it came through in her voice.I want a better life for my girls.I know, Ruby told her.At least were all equal now.The woman licked her lips.Maybe.She took each girls hand and turned, the children looking back to wave at Ruby.Marcelle and Onor finished sweeping the room and stopped by her.Haric and I need to get back, Ruby said.Before Ani and Joel go crazy, Haric added.Marcelle narrowed her eyes.You snuck out?Ruby grinned.There wasnt anyone to tell me not to come.Joel was meeting with his advisors, and Ani had gone to get Dayn from somewhere.I left them a note.Marcelle gave her a high sign while Onor looked away.He was so sensitive.His features fit himhigh cheekbones in an oval face, dark hair and eyes, eyelashes too long for a man.Sensitive features, the face of someone who spent his time worrying and daydreaming.Ruby had to admit, he was getting good at being a bodyguard.Hed grown strong and wiry with work, and he was even a bit handsome.Walk with me?she asked him.Onors answer was to start off while she and Marcelle followed.She loved him.She truly did.Theyd grown up together.But she couldnt give up Joel, or what she was doing.Nor did she want to.Joel challenged her in ways Onor never could.Onor led them into a side corridor and then through a doorway into one of the maintenance corridors.They dodged two cleaning bots and came back out into a bigger hallway surrounded by habs.Where are you taking us?Ruby asked as he twisted into another empty corridor.Its a shortcut.Onor stopped suddenly, flinging a hand up to get attention.Wait, he hissed.Marcelle stepped toward him.Ruby wanted to giggle.Marcelle had never listened to Onor.But she sobered up immediately when his hand leapt for the stunner tucked into his belt.He turned and glanced at Ruby, catching her eyes and looking at the weapon in his hand.Before she had time to understand, the heavy weapon arced through the air toward her.She caught the gun and pointed it down, her heart racing.Onor pulled out a second stunner and kept it.Beside her, Marcelle had her own stunner out and was turning to look behind them.Ruby crouched, making herself small, staying ready to run in either direction, to help either friend.Onors breathing sounded loud.Marcelle turned and bumped into her, almost knocking her off her feet.The corridors looked empty behind and ahead.Its okay, Onor whispered, his voice quivery.Ruby stood up and touched his back.No, he said.Its not okay.But its safe.I think.What could have made him stutter so?She stepped around him.A red in full uniform stretched across the floor.His head had been bashed in from behind.One of the rogues?Then some instinct made her empty stomach sour and she leaned over and rolled the body so that she could see his face.Bens face.Ruby crumpled in on herself, her knees hitting the hard floor.A thin wail of grief rose around her, filling the corridor, and at first she didnt recognize it as coming from her own heart.4     Ruby periodically wiped angry tears from her face as she, Onor, Marcelle, and Haric walked warily through the back corridors of the ship.She kept seeing the pool of blood below Bens head in the corridor.Blood stained the necklace shed made him, stained her hands, and her hands had stained her new shirt and then her gray pants when she shoved the necklace into her pocket.Blood everywhere.Bens death cut deeper than any death from the days of fighting, even deeper than Hughs.It was like Nonas death, all those years ago.It would haunt her.It would haunt her a long time.She would fight harder now.That was how shed handled Nona dying in her arms, and it was how shed handle Ben dying in an empty corridor.From time to time she swiped at tears.It took well over two hours to get home.At least Onor herded them at a good clip, his worry keeping her tense until they neared the barrier between command and the rest of the ship.Once there, she turned to Onor and said, Will you do me a favor?What?Check on Bens body.See that hes treated right, prepared for a full funeral.After I take you to Joel.She cast a meaningful glance toward the door symbols which showed they were just on the other side of command.If Im not safe in there, I might as well give myself up now.Onor looked like he wanted to refuse, but Marcelle tugged on his arm and said, You can come back here later.But I have to go home, and I dont want to be alone.That made Onor go, although he looked pained about it.Bless Marcelle.Ruby and Haric headed for the map room.I wish I hadnt found Ben for you.Haric sounded miserable.Its not your fault.Haric looked up at Ruby.Ben said nice things about you.He liked you a lot.And he was nice to me.Not everyone was.Haric tended to place himself in the middle of everything.He was one of those older boys who wanted to be a man so bad it hurt him.Ruby responded, He was sweet to everyone, and Im glad youre with me.You do need someone to keep you safe.She smiled for the first time since theyd found Bens remains, but hid her smile underneath a cough.Perhaps well see something in the map room that will tell us something.Can I go in?If youre with me.Not that she knew that, but she didnt really care.When they got to the door, she swiped her wrist in front of the lock and pulled Haric in after her.He stopped stiff beside her, his mouth agape.The awe on his face reminded her of the first time shed seen the command table.Command was the only place on the Fire with interactive and detailed maps.Sure, Ix could display bits and pieces anywhere for anyone he wanted, but there were no other display screens big enough to show the whole ship in detail.The map room was roughly half the size of the common room shed just been singing to hundreds of people in.Unlike common, which had odd corners, this was an exact square with seats neatly fastened to the walls.The square table dominated the center of the room.Haric raced to the table and stared at the shifting images that showed on its surface.On the right side, Ani and Dayn sat beside each other on a couch.Anis dark skin stood out from the white walls.Her hair trailed down her side in a thick, unruly braid.Beside Ani, Dayn was gesturing in the air about something, looking quite convinced about some point or another.Ruby didnt see Joel anywhere.Movement from the far side of the room caught her eye.A man shed seen in Joels cabinet meetings started straight for Haric.Laird?Yes.Hed led some of the fighters from command, which was more an act of giving orders than of firing a stunner.Hed never shown any appreciation for all her people had done, never welcomed her or Onor or anyone new.She moved to intercept him.What happened to you?he asked.Theres blood everywhere.A friend died.Laird nodded curtly.She wasnt at all sure he was sorry.It was possible he was wishing she had died.Why is that boy here?he demanded.I let him in.Hes not cleared.Haric had turned to watch them, his back to the table and his eyes wide.His longish brown hair curled over a dirty blue shirt.The knees of his pants were stained by Bens blood.Not exactly the neat look that permeated command.Haric is my personal runner.Really?Surely she could convince Joel she needed one.And Haric knew the ship.Really.Hell keep our secrets.The glare on Lairds face told her he had trouble believing either what she said or that she was saying it to him.Maybe both.You are accountable for him.Very well.Harics shoulders relaxed a little and he seemed to stand taller, but otherwise he didnt acknowledge that he had been the subject of the conversation.Hed grown up in the cargo bars, so he was used to tense situations.Hopefully he considered this a promotion.Haric, this is Laird.He is one of Joels trusted men.Haric held out a hand.Pleased to meet you.Laird gave Harics hand a very short shake, his facial expression suggesting that touching Haric was about as attractive as a headache.Well, she was getting used to that.Not everyone on this level was charmed by her, either.Dayn and Ani had noticed the confrontation and flanked her.What happened?The blood.She nodded at Laird, an attempt at dismissal.He only took a step back and turned, standing with his back to them and contemplating the table but close enough to hear anything she said.A friend was killed.In gray?Ani asked.On the outer level, Ruby automatically corrected her.He was a peacer.He used to patrol our area.You saw him.On the vid, the day I sang for Owl Paulie.Ben.The big bulky one who stood beside me, the one I gave a necklace to.Is that why he was killed?Haric asked.Out of the mouth of a child.I dont know.Ben had been one of the first reds to openly support her, to wear the multiple colors of the revolutionary sign.The idea that he might have died because of that raised a lump in her throat all over again.Well find out.She didnt want to talk more with Laird there, so she addressed Ani.Do you know where Joel is?Right here.His rich, strong voice came from behind her, softening her before she even saw him.She had no idea how hed slid into the room unnoticed.Relief filled her.He looked down at Ruby, his greenish blue eyes hard.I heard there was a murder out there.She felt the tug of him.His presence always warmed and attracted her.Even when he was angry.I found him.Or, Onor and I did.Im sorry.It was brutal.Whoever did it bashed his head in with something heavy.She looked down, her throat thick with new, unshed tears.Id just talked to him, just before.She hesitated again, remembering the hug shed given Ben.He came to warn me that Ellis and Sylva are still planning a coup.Ben said they want me, but I bet they want you, too.She took in a trembling breath and waited for Joels reaction.He looked even angrier, his jaw set tight.She couldnt tell if it was because Ben had died, or she had gone out, or on account of Ellis and Sylva.In spite of the anger she could feel, he looked neat.That was a signature thing about him; everything in its place.As always.Joel was a little like Ben, she realized.He stuck to his old personae, wore his old uniform.The only visible concession to the new order was a belt her aunt Daria had given him, one Dariad made herself from braided and dyed tree bark.He took her hand and his face softened a little.You need to clean up.Yes.And to be alone with him.Ani, Dayn.Will you show Haric how the table works and then get him a room near ours?Ani nodded, but Dayn mocked her good naturedly.Yes, Maam.At your pleasure.They had once both been her keepers, almost jailers, and Dayn had ranked Ani.In the last few months, power had reversed.They still worked well together, but since Joel took command, Dayn had grown ever more sarcastic.She liked that about him.Thank you, Dayn.He grunted.A small laugh escaped Rubys lips in spite of her tired, burning anger.Ruby worked on the blood in her shirt, periodically double tapping the water button to demand more than her allotment.It didnt matter, not right now.All that mattered was getting the damned blood out of everything.That, and not crying.She couldnt cry.Joel hated weakness.When the water finally ran clear, she hung her dripping shirt to dry in the tiny shower.She ran a comb through her hair, then pinched her cheeks to color them.Clad in damp underwear, she walked from the privy to the bedroom.Joel sat on the bad, fully dressed, a serious look on his face.You shouldnt have been out there.Of course I should have.I dont intend to scrub your blood from my hands.She opened a drawer.Good.I dont want you to.Ever.She faced him and gave him her best smile.I have to go out there.Her voice still shook a little.She took a deep breath.Its for you, too.He pulled her back on the bed, turned so he held her down ever so gently.Having you safe is good for me.She stayed still under his arm, thinking about how to handle him in this moment.We need my people.They wont respect just talking to them through speakers.They need to see us.She took a deep breath.Besides, thats what we fought for.So I could be here.She wriggled, rolled to a face him.I fought to be free to go anywhere on the ship.That meant to go home to my people, and to come home to you.He smothered her mouth with his, and she returned the kiss.Hard.As soon as he lifted some of his weight from her, she pushed him further away and sat up on the bed, crossing her legs in front of her as if she were in a dress instead of nearly naked, and leaning back on her hands.I will not give up my freedom.He stared at her, his incredibly colored eyes looking directly at her, blue and green and flecked with gold, and so strong.She loved those eyes, could fall into them.We have to work together, she whispered.We can work together here.You could come with me, she countered.No.He shook his head and reached a hand out, setting it warm and firm on her calf.His voice was soft.Ive been there before, you know.Its where I met Onor.But right now there is no time.You have no idea how many people need a piece of me, or how many enemies we have.She did have an idea of the enemies.Im among friends out there.Ill be sure Onor or Marcelle or someone is with me.And before he could argue further, Oh ...and I told Haric he could help mebe a runner.Can you fix up his security?Joel blinked at her, as if barely following the change, then she saw his first smile since shed come out of the privy.It quirked up one side of his mouth a little more than the other, taking a few years off.He was still older than she was by double, but when she could get him to play, it relaxed him.She uncrossed her ankles and bent slightly at the waist to take his hand from her calf and cup it in both of her hands.Thank you.I didnt say yes.Please?Yes.She would take that as a yes for permission to travel and for Haric.He let her pull him up beside her and then they were kissing again, her fingers undoing the buttons on his uniform shirt as his hand slid between her thighs.5     Shes never going to leave him for you, Marcelle muttered.I never thought she was.Onor sipped his stim, savoring the bitter taste.The big shared galley was noisy with traffic as people waited for Bens funeral to start.Are you going to be alone your whole life?He swallowed.I dont know.I can picture it now.You can sit and watch her sing every day.You can collect a hug every night as she goes to some other mans bed.Marcelle pushed away from their shared table.Ill be right back.She left too quickly for him to make out the nuances of her expression.She hadnt sounded bitter or mad.Maybe frustrated.He sighed.This was the first time hed seen Marcelle since they found Bens body three days ago, and here she was teasing him about Ruby already.He couldnt remember a time when he didnt know Marcelle.Maybe there was a downside to being known too well.He sighed and sipped more stim, feeling it crawl along his nerves and wake him up from the inside out.Joel probably knew exactly how he felt, but surely he also knew that Onor respected him.Ruby alone would not have freed the ship, could not have.Shed needed Joels contacts in command, and his tactical skills.His ruthlessness.Hed needed her support in gray.A relationship built around mutual power.Hey.Marcelle slid back into her seat.Quit thinking so hard.We have work to do.Whoever killed Ben might show up at his funeral.You know, Onor mused, I thought that when we won, we won.That everything would be better.But its almost as bad.Its not as bad.Marcelle gave her cup down to a passing kitchen bot.Before we won, we knew who was on our side, and it was almost no one.Its harder to see our enemies when they dont show themselves by the color of their clothes.At least there are fewer of them.Theres more.We used to only see the ones who came to us.Now theres a ship full.And a ship full of friends.The dangers are a little harder to smell out.She laughed.It was true, though.Before the day the ships walls opened between the outer habs where the grays lived and worked and rest of the ship, they hadnt been sure of the Fires size.There were four levels, each level a ring inward from the outermost skin of the Fire.He liked to think of the setup as keeping gray closest to space, to the planets and suns and other worlds that were surely just on the other side of the insulating cargo ring.He imagined that he and Ruby and Marcelle grew up as near to the stars as they could get.When they were kids, Ben had chased them out of all kinds of trouble.Onor swallowed, his throat hot with memory.I miss Ben already.Me, too.Onor set his own cup on another bot, and stood up.Im tired of people dying.Lets go make sure no one else dies today.When they arrived in common, the big room was already crowded.I didnt expect so many people, Marcelle said.Ruby wanted everyone on the ship to watch.So orders went everywhere.Marcelle let out a long, slow whistle.Wow.I bet a lot of people are here just to hear her sing.Well they certainly didnt all know Ben, Marcelle muttered.Sure enough, there were hand lettered signs with Rubys name on them, and he saw three shirts with her name worked into them as well: dyed, and in one case, embroidered in multi colored thread.Onor touched the pin he and Marcelle wore.The flattened oval pin was the same shape as the Fire, and the only way to tell he and Marcelle were on patrol.Screens around them hummed alive, still blank but ready.Ixs most commanding voice played from all of the speakers at once.Please take a seat.We are gathered to honor the life of Ben Lubuck, a member of the peacekeeping force of The Creative Fire.There werent enough places to sit.Children got pulled fussing into laps and some adults chose to simply lean against any available wall space.There was no way for this ceremony to avoid echoing Owl Paulies funeral, where Ben had stood beside Ruby as she sang The Owls Song, whichin a wayhad started all of this.Ruby chose to play up the parallel.Everyone in the cramped room with her had dressed in a mishmash of uniform colors.Shed even gotten Joel to change his usual green dress shirt for a gray one.Onor smiled, wishing hed had a surveillance bot on the wall for that conversation.Instead of the usual two blue attendants, Ani stood at Rubys side, and beside Joel, Chitt, who had been a reda peacekeeperlike Ben.Also like Ben, Chitt had supported Rubys bid for equality early.It also meant there was a green, a blue, a red, and a gray on the stage, all of them wearing mixed up colors now.Onor admired Rubys choices.Joel spoke first, his voice booming through the speakers.Thank you, thank you.Thank you for the honor of your attendance.I dont know how many of you knew Ben, but when we are done with his story, all of you will know him, and will know how much he meant to this ship.An interesting opening.On screen, Joel continued.Ben started his career as a peacekeeper in command.He was my bodyguard when I was in school.He escorted me to and from school, to and from play sessions, and kept me safe.He stopped a plot to steal Garths daughter, Alinia.He was hurt in the process, but highly decorated for saving the young womans life.After he recovered, he was offered a job with fewer physical requirements, but he refused.He asked to go out to gray and help there.Wow.A whole backstory Onor hadnt known at all.Interesting.And now, Ill pass the storytelling onto Ruby Martin.Joel gave a little flourish.A smattering of clapping started.She put her hands up, palms out, to request quiet.After it came, she said, I hope that clapping was for Ben.Without him, I wouldnt be wearing these colors.I wouldnt have sung for Owl Paulie all those months ago.Ben watched over me and my friends when we were children.He failed to report us when we snuck into workshops and onto roofs, although he chased us back home.He gave us grief for bad choices, but he didnt let them ruin us.Onor felt his eyes sting and his jaw tighten.He had the same memories, the same love for the old man whose body lay wrapped in red cloth at Rubys feet.Marcelles arm slid around Onors waist and he leaned into her a little, forgetting to watch the crowd.Because of Ben, we learned enough fear to be careful.Most importantly, Ben taught us that reds were not all evil.Oh, he could be tough.I saw him turn in a thief once, and catch a man who drank and beat his wife and children.But he didnt overplay his hand on the simple transgressions of childhood.He acted like a father to us.That was something none of the three of us had.I met other reds who used their power for evil, who raped, who killed, who tormented.She paused, and Onor remembered uncountable nights alone.Reds had killed his parents.Ruby spoke into the silence of his remembering.Ben was never like that.He never betrayed or hurt anyone.He disciplined, he lectured.Her voice had grown thick but it only made the quiet in common deeper as people strained to make out her words.He loved.He held Marcelles small hand tight while Ruby said, Ben was a traditional man.He would have wanted me to sing the traditional song.So join with me while I do that.When were done, I have a special song that I wrote just for you all tonight.But first ...She launched into the funeral song, her voice coming from all around them.She left out all of the frills and trills that had crept into some of her more recent work; she sang as true and traditional as hed ever heard.Tears ran down Marcelles face.He gave her hand a fresh squeeze and leaned over to whisper in her ear.Ill be back.Save my seat.No, Ill come, she said, wiping at her cheeks.They walked slowly around the room, scanning the crowd.Most people seemed affected by the funeral, quiet or even tearful.There were people he knew.Fingers to touch and shoulders to put a hand on briefly.He watched for The Jackman, but didnt see him.Two boys pelted along a wall with makeshift guns and almost knocked him down, but he managed to avoid them.The song trailed off.Ruby held the last note for a long time, her voice strong.She fed from these people, from being watched.She spoke.Thank you for joining me.We wish Ben good travels.Then the ritual startedthe picking up of the body, the careful slide of corpse and board down the chute and out to become space debris among the stars.Maybe there was something good for Ben to see out there.Maybe, like the song suggested, the dead among the Fires crew would meet Ben in space.He snorted.A childs hope.The world had lost someone good.Ruby turned back toward them, a faint trail of tears visible on her cheeks.Ben was a symbolhe was red through and through.He held the highest ideals of a peacekeeper.He should be an example to all of you who once wore red.We, the crew of the Fire, must be one people, for we will be home soon and we must speak with one voice.She took Joels hand.He stepped forward, the move a little scripted.We are facing the unknown, Joel said, and we must face it together.That was the perfect opening for Homecoming, but Ruby moved directly into a song Onor had never heard.He was still walking and watching, so he didnt catch all of the words.The chorus repeated three times:  Together we are a seed Preparing to open in the light Of Adiamo.To flower.Now, Ruby said, Now we must all be together.We must forgive the past and we must stop killing.Now is the time to whisper your own small last goodbyes to Ben if you havent done so yet, to do a last honor.Tomorrow, we will have a festival.A new festival.She hadnt told him about that.He found Marcelle.What do you think?I think it was brilliant that she didnt mention Ben was murdered.Everyone knows it, and they all know she knows it, but shes taking us higher.Onor recalled the way hed imagined the death song being sung for Ruby herself.I hope she doesnt get herself murdered.Marcelle frowned.I bet shes planning on attending as many of the festival spots as possible.Ill stay with her, Onor said.Marcelle gave him a long look, and he wasnt quite sure what he saw in her eyes.She was as almost as tall as he was, so it was easy for her to lean over and kiss him right on the lips.Good.6     Ruby paced the command room, threading through people dressed in finery, careful not to meet their eyes or stop to talk, She needed to think.It was time for another celebration.Past time.Bright banners streamed digitally across all of the screens in the Fire, proclaiming tonight the Festival of Hope.She imagined people all over the ship getting ready, finding their best clothes, doing each others hair.Joel was elsewhere with his commanders.Jaliet had helped her choose a purple dress belted in gray.It swung loosely around her hips, the color shifting and changing with her movements.She felt pleased; Jaliet had driven her staff to create a color that Ruby had never seen rendered in fabric.She paced the room slowly, full of pent up energy.Ix had told her it could still be months before they got close enough to home to make voice contact, especially now that the Fire only moved at about a tenth of the speed it used between systems.Just yesterday shed heard the rumor againthat Adiamo would be abandoned.To believe that would be to accept death aboard the struggling Fire.So, assuming there were people, what would they be like now?Although she didnt understand why, Ix and Joel and others had told her more time passed in the Adiamo system than on the ship.Ix?She spoke to the air.In this room, that was enough.Yes, Ruby?Could we start schools?To learn what we knew when we left home?There was a slightly longer silence than usual.What do you want to know?She shook her head.Customs would have changed.Joel had helped her see that one of the great weaknesses of the Fire was that knowledge didnt change fast or go deep.She had learned to repair bots, but she would never have been able to build one.Her hands fisted, and she took a deep breath and forced them to relax.Can you make a list of what we used to know and dont know anymore?Knowledge slip is a matter of degree.You have all been taught the skills you need for your jobs.Damned AI.Will you or wont you?I will try.She came up beside Haric, Ani, and Onor, who were leaning over the map table.Four pods blinked orange.The others were yellow or green.Ruby touched Anis shoulder.What did you ask it?Where you can go safely tonight.Ruby squinted at the colors, memorizing the red ones.How did you decide?Haric answered.Onor asked Ix where people are saying bad things about you.Ruby frowned.Then thats where I should go.Onor looked exasperated.Some days I swear you have a death wish.Ani interrupted the potential argument.Were classifying your enemies.Theres Lya and her crowd.Not too dangerous, although Lyas still mad enough to slap you.Ruby laughed.I can take her.And theres Ellis and Sylva.Do you know where they are?That was a group she might just avoid.Haric answered.Not in the outer levels.Not on command.So that leaves them in between.He glanced at her.You could stay away from there.Hardly.What about cargo?Colin keeps that.Its safe.She smiled at Harics defense of his old boss.Joel came up behind her.Are you almost ready?Yes, sweetheart.She loved the way she smiled at the sound of his voice.Can we start in cargo?Ill order the train to take us there.The cargo bar hummed with activity.Most of Colins strength seemed to be on display: men and women with well muscled limbs, stunners, and the periodic scar or disfigurement that went with hard work.These were the people who lived in the shadows of the ship, trading on goods, information, and services that the formal power structure needed but couldnt perform itself.Colin came up to greet them, clad all in black.His clothes matched his graying black hair and intense dark eyes, and the tiniest bit of black beard.The beards new, Ruby commented.He laughed.With you rogues in charge, I needed to look more dangerous.So youre not going to obey us either?Joel smiled as he said it.And lose my reputation like youve lost yours?Someone has to lead, Joel said.Better you than me.Colin took Rubys arm.Can I get you a drink?We want to talk to people.Later.Let me get you a drink.Wine, she said.Joel leaned down and gave her a hug.Ill catch up to you.She watched him walk away.Even from the back, even from a distance, he made her feel short of breath.When she focused back on Colin, he was looking at her quizzically.You really do love him, dont you?Dont you?she shot back.No matter what you want to believe, he is your captain.Hes very good at his job.Colin laughed.Hes a better captain than the old one.The gentle pressure of his hand on her arm steered her toward the bar, where she hopped up on a seat and crossed her legs, being careful not to muss her dress.Colin brought her wine and poured a glass of still for himself.As he handed her the glass, he said, How is it?Being close to the top?Harder than I thought.He gestured expansively around the room.Its been ten times as hard to keep this place going as it was to compete for the top spot.He meant more than the bars.Colin controlled a whole population of strongmen and misfits that he glued together with a combination of power, promises, and a sense of home.How different is it now that Garths out of power?He laughed.We never cared much who ran things.Going home is a bigger deal.Theres far more people coming here for drinks or dances or songs.Change makes people crave ways to forget it.She sipped at her wine.Your drinks here are always too sweet.He ignored her comment.Is Joel going to let you come sing for us again?Of course.He looked skeptical.Well, Ruby said, Theres still a few strays to round up.We won, but theres people who wont accept that.Surely you hear stories.In a bar?Never.He tilted his head back and poured the entirety of his glass of clear still down his throat, barely reacting.Id fall over if I did that.He laughed.We need to focus on what happens when we get home.She set her glass down.It wouldnt do to get tipsy so early in the evening.Can you tell people when that might be?No.If I knew, Id tell.Then what good are you?She missed everything about the outer level.As she moved from the inner circles to the outside, the Fire seemed to go from clean to gritty, from backstabbing to brutally honest.Will you show me more about the cargo holds?Take me through them?Im trained for null g.  He narrowed his eyes.Why?That might be our wealth when we get home.And I have no idea whats in them.Ill talk to Joel.I can make my own decisions.He gave her a long thoughtful look.You should stop that.Its dangerous.He ran a finger across her cheek, sending heat into her belly.Hed always been attractive, and shed always resisted.She leaned away from his touch.I need to lead from in front.Thats why people respect me.Thats a dangerous way to do it.You should try it sometime.You know nothing, he said.He looked away, but not fast enough to hide the hurt she hadnt meant to cause him.7     Rubys feet throbbed even though she wasnt standing on them.Theyd spent an hour visiting two parks out in the working levels of the ship, and now they were headed one level inward by train.Ani and Dayn and a few others had caught up with them, and sat talking softly near the back of the train car.Ruby let her head rest on Joels shoulder, lulled into dozing dreams by the low conversations around them, the soothing whoosh of the train, and the warmth of Joels arm against her back.The whine of metal on metal snapped Rubys eyes open, and Joels arm tightened around her.His other arm shot out and braced them as the train car jerked and jerked again.They inched forward and came to a complete stop.Dim light showed the outside walls, just a touch more gray than the black of the deep tunnel.Ruby stood and peered through the window.Joel stood beside her, close but not touching.What do you see?Nothing yet.Doors and darkness.Behind them, Onor started yelling at people.Up.Be ready.The train jerked forward, rocked, and jerked forward again.Ruby barely managed to keep her feet under her.The station and train doors aligned.Actually, one door, and with only a small window in it.Nothing more than a maintenance stop.Perhaps the Fire had another damned problem.But if so, she hadnt felt it or seen it, and surely Ix would have used the train cars speakers to tell them about it.The station door opened.Joel shoved Ruby behind him.His stunner appeared in his hand as if it sprang there by his will alone.Onor stood beside him, fumbling with his own gun.Haric was a step behind Onor and next to Ruby, his face ashen with fright.The train doors slid open.Ruby didnt have a weapon.She peered around Joels back.The room was full of men and women wearing pure red and blue, a protest in color.They pointed stunners at the train doors, aimed, shot.The bodyguard closest to Joel fell, fast but loose, the boneless crumple of the stunned.Joel fired once, twice, his shoulders moving against her as he aimed again.He stood completely exposed, as exposed as their attackers front line.The groups were maybe twenty steps apart.A scream from inside the station drove their enemies toward the train car.Ani tugged on Rubys arm, pulling her back as the orderly group outside turned into a mob and rushed the train doors.Joel twisted oddly and leaned toward her.She leaned back into him for a moment to hold him up, then stumbled.He fell on top of her, face to face.He caught some of his weight on his arm, crying out.At least Joel wasnt the dead weight of the completely stunned, although he must have taken a partial hit.His eyes were wide, like the idea that he could be hurt had startled him.Ruby hissed for Ani.People fought hand to hand, clogging the trains doorway.Onor and Haric were in the front.Ruby spotted Anis dark skin through the legs of a tall guard who leaned over her and Joel.From behind her, a barked command.Down!Onor ducked, pulling Haric down with him.The guards fired over them.Ani scuttled up and she and Ruby each took one of Joels arms and tugged him back.He struggled and then found his feet, standing up near the back of the train car.His left arm hung loosely at his side and a grimace of pain marred his features.He turned toward the door but Ruby held him back.Wait until youre steady.He grimaced but obeyed.He climbed up on one of the train seats and looked over the heads of their defenders.Ruby stood beside Ani, trying to make sense of the chaotic movement.Screams and grunts came from inside and outside the car.The stunners were too quiet to hear over the chaos of commands and counter commands.One of their guards fell backward into the train, hitting his head on a seat and gashing his scalp.He had been stunned, and didnt react at all to the blood pouring down the side of his face from the fresh gash.Ruby cursed, and told Ani, Keep the blood out of his eyes and put pressure on the wound.She reached across the mans inert body and picked up his stunner, which had fallen on the other side of him.She checked it for charge.It was good, barely used at all.She stood up behind the other guards.There were at least twenty or twenty five attackers standing close outside the train door.None had gained entrance.A few sprawled on the ground, as stunned as the guard who now lay bleeding behind her.She looked for a face she knew among the attackers, found it.Sylva.Right there in front, her small pinched features pulled tight by her high gray ponytail.She wore a full red uniform and held a stunner in each hand.She seemed to be searching the train car.Looking for Ruby.Ruby took a half step forward.Sylvas eyes met Rubys.Ruby screamed, Hope.She raised her arm and aimed.Its about hope, you bitch!She fired.Sylva sneered at her and raised her right hand, sighting down the stunner.Ruby ducked.It was clear now that shed missed.The man closest to Ruby fell.A door in the back of the train station sprang open.Two of the reds fell forward.Three of Joels people pushed in through the door.One of them was built like Chitt, although Ruby couldnt see her face to be sure.It looked like there were more behind them.Some of the attackers turned and fired at the new threat.The fight looked surreal.Part dance, part struggle.The train beeped and someone pulled her backwards.The station doors and the train doors shut in concert, and all she could see through the porthole window in the door was a blur of activity.Ruby checked to be sure that everyone was okay.The stunned man had stopped bleeding and there were two more stretched out on the floor.Ani moved among them, making sure they were in natural positions; they couldnt move themselves until their nervous systems woke up.Onor saw to Joels arm.The remaining guards wandered about the train car, talking in low tones and watching the dull and featureless tunnel go by.She leaned against the wall of the train behind the door, muttering, Its about hope.8     Onor didnt relax until the train doors slid open to reveal the muted greens and golds of a command station.Four of Joels staff stood waiting for them: Laird, SueAnne, Bruce, and Michael.Three old men and an old woman, all of them gray haired and severe.Onor turned to help Joel and Ruby off the train.Ruby looked shocked and Joels arm still hung limply at his side.The effect of the partial hit should wear off soon.The three men who had been more thoroughly stunned were all awake now, although they needed help getting out of the train.Joel ignored Onors offered hand and helped Ruby down himself, but he did give Onor an approving nod.You were good back there.Thank you.Onor fought a rising blush in his cheeks.I want to know how they made the train stop.Not as much as I do.Joels lieutenants surrounded them.SueAnne put a gnarled hand on Joels arm, and whispered just loud enough for Onor to hear.Ix has news.Its waiting for you.A brief pout crossed Rubys face, quickly replaced by curiosity.As they moved down the corridor toward the map room, SueAnne shuffled and hitched in an odd gait, her face screwed into a look that suggested moving this fast required a true effort.Maybe the battle theyd just been in was one of many.Maybe there was a bigger organized resistance than he or Joel had thought possible.After all, no one had expected the opposition to be able to stop a train.It implied a lot of people helping Sylva and Ellis.Hed been fascinated with power for a long time, with the way it changed peoples actions.And since theyd won, hed learned something else about power: the loss of power drove people crazy.Some losers reacted well to the changes, even embraced them.Some of these did their old jobs while wearing different clothing.A few had chosen to trade peacekeeping for gardening or repairing or nursing.But some who lost real power rebelled.Ellis and Sylva had just tried to kill Ruby for her power.They should be punished for it.He would see to that, find them and lock them up.First he needed to find out what SueAnne was so upset about.She had always been the only woman in Joels power structure, unless you counted Ruby.And now she looked really worried.Almost shocked.They nearly tumbled into the map room.Everyone with any formal power in command must have also been called.Onor spotted three or four other lieutenants, his own ex boss Conroy, KJ and three of his special traineesthe dancers who fought with no weapons and won.Inside the map room, people ranged shoulder to shoulder almost all the way around the map table, which displayed its default map of the Fire, the edges of the ship touching the edges of the table.Ix!Joel proclaimed.Im here.How did they stop the train?I have something more important to discuss.Ixs command voice, the clipped one.Joel simply stood, waiting.His face was a mask of patience, but Onor now knew him well enough to be sure he was sorting through ideas faster than anyone else in the room.Ruby must have been thinking like Onor, since she asked, Were there any other attacks?Ix answered in pictures.The image of The Creative Fire in the table shrank in front of them, becoming no bigger than a fist, visible over on the side of the table near Ani and Dayn.The background morphed from black to a night sky full of stars, nebulae, and wheeling galaxies.Onor leaned over the table.He whispered, Adiamo.Weve heard from Adiamo.He hadnt known the table could show the stars they flew throughhe would have stood here entranced for days.The whole room had quieted.A structure appeared on the far side of the table.It was bigger than the Fire, maybe twice as big.Now Ix spoke.Onor is almost right.The Fires velocity is being matched by a ship, which must be from the Adiamo system.It has not attempted to contact us, nor has it responded when I have tried to contact its AI.It is violating protocols.Joel spoke.Do you have any idea why?KJ said, Perhaps so much time has changed that the computers speak different languages.That is possible, Ix replied.I cannot tell if it is an official delegation or a semi random encounter.Which is the most likely?Joel asked.KJ wanted to know, Will it get physically close to us?Ix answered them both.We cannot turn the Fire at this speed and we have no long range weapons.The only option is to watch, listen, and prepare.It may be quite close by this time tomorrow.If we dont have long range weapons, what do we have?Ruby asked.There are objects we might turn into weapons.I am testing.Joels voice was calm.Can you tell how big the ship is?Perspective shifted so the image of the strange ship flew in the exact middle.Ix zoomed in.Onor leaned close, holding his breath.Home.Something from home.Change.He bit his lip, the pain telling him this was real.Where the Fire was a flattened oval, just barely too thick to look like a disk, this ship was a cylinder.The Fires sleek skin was smooth outside.This one bristled with things Onor didnt recognize.Smaller ships stuck to it, ovals and long poles stuck out from it.Pits marred its surface.Onor disliked the ship on sight.Ruby voiced it better than Onor could, her voice full of dismay.Its ugly.KJ raised his voice.We should withhold judgment.Joel snapped, Acknowledged.Ruby pushed herself away from the table.We have to tell everyone.No.Joel gave her a glance full of warning.Not yet.Ruby tensed.Of course we do.What if its dangerous?Laird spoke over her, his steady gaze a clear challenge.What can they possibly do to help?Joel looked at Laird for a long, contemplative moment.Its decent to tell them.But we need a plan first.Laird dropped his eyes and his lips twisted into a bitter half smile.SueAnne spoke up.They are possible fighters.Ruby grimaced, but offered a compromise, Perhaps we need to plan both a welcome and a defense.Joel grimaced.Defense first.Ruby had achieved a partial victory; Onor and Haric were ordered to take the train to the cargo bars and tell Colin about the ship.This time, there were no unscheduled stops.For the most part, the train was returning tired festival goers to their homes.A peacekeeper rode quietly in each car.Onor had believed Ruby when she told him they were going home.He had felt the journey when she sang Homecoming.But never before had there been physical evidence that anything except the Fire existed.He wanted to see a planet and a sky.Animals.The Fire held no live animals except humans.Now, after staring at all of the mysteries on the outside of the ugly ship and contemplating the mysteries inside, he wondered if he had been nave.Maybe he should be afraid instead of excited.The train stopped, and he and Haric got off and jogged to the cargo bars.It felt good to move, and even better to turn up the steps and take them quickly.The watchers at the door waved Onor and Haric past without hesitating.Inside, the room hummed with the extra loud laughter of drinkers.Haric led Onor to Colin, seated over a game of Planazate with a man Onor had seen but didnt really know.He struggled for the mans name.Allen.Hed led a group of Colins fighters, and Onor recalled that he had been successful.There wasnt a mark on him.Although Colin was the same age as Joel, and also had graying hair and a slight but strong build, the resemblance ended there.Colin had a wildness about him that Onor loved and feared.He smiled at Haric as they walked up.Hows my little turncoat doing?Miss you too, Haric shot back.He pulled himself up and looked serious.Ruby and Joel sent us with news.What is it?Haric shifted his weight from foot to foot.We need to talk in private.Colin looked across the game board.This is Allen.You can talk in front of him.Hes trusted.Its not about last nights attacks.Colin merely raised an eyebrow.Onor spoke as softly as he could.Theres a ship.Another ship.Ix saw it.We could see it on the map.Colin stood up and gestured for Allen to do the same.Come with me.He led the four of them to a small office and shut the door.A table and four chairs filled one side, a long couch on the other.A dark vid screen hugged a third wall.They sat around the table and Colin leaned forward, his features tense and curious.Tell me.They told him, Haric filling in details after Onor told the main story.When Colin ran out of questions, he sat back, his face as stony as Joels had been at the news.Maybe that was a lesson about leading: dont give your emotions away.Allen wasnt nearly as hard to read.His dark eyes had narrowed and he brushed a lock of dark hair from his face, tucking it behind his ear and shaking his head.He looked both determined and scared.He blurted out, We need to get everyone ready for a fight.Just in case.Colin unclipped his journal from his belt and fiddled with it for a few seconds.His voice was as cold as the dark parts of the ship.Ix.Yes, Colin?Why did I have to learn this from couriers?I can only relay threats to the Fire to those in formal command.I thought you would say something like that, you damned hellion of a machine.I cannot override my command structures.Unless you want to.Colins laughter sounded bitter.You are also charged with protecting the ship.I hardly imagine that if there was no command structure left you would ignore the dangers.Ix didnt reply.After a few breaths of silence, Colin asked the machine, How dangerous do you think this is?If I can find a way to communicate with the strange ship, I may be able to answer that question.Can you show them what it looks like?Haric asked.Ix normally didnt obey people who were still underage, but the image of the ugly ship showed up on the face of Colins journal.Colin stared at it for a long moment, handed it over to Allen to give him a good look, and then took his journal back.You told me we wouldnt make contact this soon.Ix did not respond to statements.Colin shifted his attention from the journal to Onor.What do they want us to do?Deploy fighters.There will be a ship wide announcement in two hours.Joel asked that you keep the people in the cargo bars and the working cargo bays all in line and calm.At least Joel plans to tell people, Allen said.Garth would have kept it secret.Haric added, Ruby made him.She says it will make everyone pull together to have an outside force.Colin laughed.I doubt Ruby actually made Joel do anything he truly didnt want to do.But trust her to see hope everywhere.Onor remembered the way her face had been screwed up in anger when she fired on Sylva.Hope can be good, even in a fight.Especially then, Colin said.He looked at Allen.Call up your fighters.Split them between two shifts.Tell them there will be news, but not yet what the news is.Will do.Allen rose and left.Colin addressed Ix again.Tell your new captain that if he will give you permission to tell me anything I ask, Ill do what he wants.He is everyones captain.Really?Colin looked lost in thought for a moment, and then he said, Let me reword my command to you.Tell Joel that if he will give you permission to tell me everything that you tell him, I will do what he asks and we will guard the cargo.Remind him that this is the outer part of the Fire, and thus the most vulnerable.He hesitated a moment.In fact, you might suggest that he send extra troops.Colin flicked his journal off, which effectively ended the conversation.Onor remembered the other threats.Colin?What do you know about the attack on the train?Sylva and Ellis have enough logistics people with them to hack the trains central command system.What happened?After the train got underway again?Colin looked disgusted.We caught three of them.Everyone who matters got away.Sylva and Ellis both, and most of the people they had with them.I thought you had them.The doors looked like they were blocked off.Colin narrowed his eyes, and Onor realized hed just challenged him.Colins voice was clipped.They went through the train tunnel.Wow.Gutsy.The tunnel was so thin in spots Onor liked to close his eyes when they passed through it in a train.At least you all got away before Ruby or Joel got themselves killed.Stupid girl, I saw her standing right in front screaming.Colin sounded proud of her.Shes brave.I know.Colin said.We were lucky it didnt take Ix long to notice theyd hacked in.It closed the holes and kicked them out.Thats why you had a ten minute fight and not a longer one.Haric looked confused.I didnt think Ix took sides.Ix is on the side of stability.Always.Dont ever make the mistake of assuming the machine has an ounce of loyalty.Onor wasnt sure about that.In Onors experience, Ix understood a lot that it wasnt willing to share.It might be Rubys most aggravating supporter, but as far as Onor could tell, it was a supporter.Colin got up and held the door open for them.Theres food at the bar if you want some before you go back.Weve been assigned to you for now, Onor said.Colin smiled.So Joel understands me more than Ix does.What do you mean?Haric asked.Joel knew I would need you more than he does.And Haric, youll be a runner back if I need one.After all, thats what you left me to do, isnt it?Run for Ruby?Haric stood up a little straighter.Yes.Colin smiled at them both, although he looked deep in thought and determined.Take time to rest and eat.I presume youll want to be on the shift that greets the strangers?Im not hungry, Haric proclaimed.Of course you are, Onor said.Youre just excited.Come on and eat.We wont have to work for a few hours and we havent rested all day.I wont sleep.Of course you wont.9     As Ruby closed the hab door behind Joel it felt like she was closing a thousand worries inside with them and a thousand more outside.How is your arm?Its fine.It was just a brush from the edge of a beam.It knocked you down.I get back up well enough.I dont know what Id do without you.He laughed.Youd bounce.She collapsed on the couch, unable to keep up any pretense of strength.Bens funeral, the festival, the attack, and dwarfing it all, the news of the strange ship.She felt stripped clean and beset with change and danger.Theyd spent hours in the map room, staring and asking questions, going round on the new ship and on Adiamo and on the reds attack.At the end theyd been asking the same questions over and over with no new answers.Their living room was big, the wall opposite them dominated by a vid system which was blessedly off at the moment.Joel stood in the middle of the room, awkward, as if unsure how to rest in the middle of a slow motion encounter with a strange spaceship.Ruby reached up and stroked his cheek.Turn around, Ill work on your back.Can we lie down for that?He wasnt teasing, he was exhausted.Maybe you should eat something before you pass out?He shook his head.We only have a few hours.She wasnt hungry either.In the weeks hed been in charge, his hair had grayed even more.But then, he almost never slept.In spite of that he often had time to think of her, to touch her and appreciate her and walk through her thinking.If anyone ever hurt him, she would kill them.If whoever was on this ship killed him, she would kill them.The ugly ship scared her.She couldnt have told anyone why, but something felt deeply wrong.In the bedroom, Joel pulled off his shirt but left his pants and socks on.He stretched out over the bed diagonally so Ruby had room to work.She rubbed his head, her fingers moving in slow circles across his scalp.What do you think they want?His reply sounded muffled by the bedclothes.Maybe they want to make us all slaves.She leaned down and kissed him, then went back to her ministrations.No, really?I didnt expect our first contact to be with a ship that looks like a childs put together robot toy.It does look like that.He shifted under her hands.Lower, right in the middle of my back.She found the place he wanted.He moaned softly as she worked knots out of the long muscles beside his spine.Maybe its more like a home than a ship.Like a space station?There was a space station in the game of Adiamo.Players had no access to it until they got one of the last two levels, and then they didnt get to spend much time there.But shed won the game over and over, and she remembered.It had looked much neater than this, though, and bigger.Maybe.If theyre friendly, I want to plan the welcoming party.Ive always imagined wed sail into Adiamo and be escorted home by friendly ships that would tell us what to do.That wed be like lost children coming home or something.He pushed up onto his elbows.Maybe it will be just like that.She let out a long sigh.I dont think so.Maybe Ix will learn something soon.If it does, you should sleep through it for now.We put SueAnne and Laird in charge so we can rest.He pulled her down beside him.You could rest, too.A brief heat flared in her at his closeness, but she forced herself to ignore it and keep working on his muscles.In no more than a few breaths, he was sound asleep, the wrinkles in his face relaxing as he fell away from the world.Ruby kept her fingers moving lightly over his skin.The Fire sounded quiet all around her as if it, too, waited.10     The metal of the corridor felt cold against Onors back.Theyd done nothing but wait for hours.Harics dark eyes stood out against pale skin turned paler by the bright white light in the corridor.Whens the ship going to do something?Haric asked.Onor spoke as soothingly as he could.You know as much as me.Which is nothing.Thats right.Onor shifted to find a more comfortable spot.Will they look the same as us?Of course they will.Ix says the ships from Adiamo, and we came from here.Onors head turned at the sound of familiar footsteps.Claire, from the cargo bar.She handed them each a wrapped up snack that smelled fabulous.Fresh orbfuit and peppery flat crackers and a dollop of protein cake for each of them.Thank you, Onor said.Claire had never much liked him, since he came from gray.Right now, she looked both nervous and like maybe he was her best friend.I needed something to do, Claire muttered, as if the confession embarrassed her.He understood.Thanks.He smiled at her.Food helps.I hope so.She continued down the corridor.Im glad were close to the bar, Haric said as he spread his protein cake over his crackers with a dirty finger.Me, too.Onor figured the easy assignment was because Colin had a soft spot for Haric and wanted him safe.Or maybe because Colin knew the kind of trouble Haric could get into and wanted to be able to see him.Ixs voice came crackling from just above them, a modulated, calm, and factual recounting Onor had grown used to after hours sitting under the speaker.The unidentified ship has now almost completely matched our trajectory and speed.It is not likely that it can come any closer to us without risk of disturbance between the drives.It has not hailed us in any way we understand.The speaker went silent again.Great.More non information.
