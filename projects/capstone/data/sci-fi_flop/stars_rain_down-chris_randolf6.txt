He might have imagined that last part.Everybody else had qualified on their first day at the range, including Leonid Nikitin who hit every target with ease.He claimed he could blind a suicidal king at three hundred meters, and it was probably true.Shooting was second nature to that man, but Jack wasnt so lucky.He was now on his third straight day of shooting, and the brass had assigned him a personal tutor as a last resort.Go ahead and take your time, his little brother Charlie said.Theres no rush today.Line it up so the post is right in the middle of the notch, then put it on your target.Jack thought it was lined up, but he wasnt sure.After all, hed thought it was lined up every other time he pulled the trigger, but that blasted target was still in one piece.Is it lined up, Jack?I think so.I need you to know it is, bro.Fine.Its lined up.Charlie sat down in the dirt next to him.Relax.I know youre frustrated, but Im trying to help.Just put the post on the target, alright?Okay, Jack said.He shifted the rifle left and right, watching the space on either side of the post shrink, then he centered it again.The top of it was level with the top of the notch, and it was sitting dead in the middle of his target.Its lined up.It helps to focus on the post, so the target is blurry behind it.Got it?Done.Now take three slow breaths.At the end of your third exhale, go ahead and squeeze the trigger.Jack filled his lungs and let the air slowly escape, then again, and one more time.At the bottom of the last exhalation, he pulled the trigger and the weapon barked.The butt stock bit into his shoulder.Charlie raised a pair of binoculars to his face and sighed.I didnt hit it, did I?Nope, Charlie said.Tell me what you did wrong.I dont fucking know, Charlie.I did everything you said.Maybe the sights are off.Charlie shook his head.Weapon was adjusted before it left the armory, and I test fired it myself.Its fine.Now tell me what you did wrong.Why dont you tell me, Jack growled through gritted teeth.Alright.Two things.First, you closed your eyes right before you fired.Dont do that.You cant hit what you cant see.Second, you pulled the trigger.I told you to squeeze it.And whats the difference?Charlie chuckled, and Jack didnt know what was so damned funny.When youre dancing with a pretty girl and youve got her hand, you pull her to you.Once youve got her close, you give her a squeeze.Jack closed his eyes for a second and Jess was there at the end of his arm.She was laughing and smiling, and he pulled her to him, but before she was in his arms, he opened his eyes and was back in eastern Israel under the hot summer sun.Charlie dropped down on his belly next to him and put his arms out like he was holding a rifle of his own.With his right hand, he extended his index finger and curled it several times.Youre pulling the trigger, and it yanks the weapon around and blows your aim all to hell.Dont pull it.Then he opened his hand up and tightened the whole thing, like he was testing fruit.Squeeze it.Gently.Now try it again.Jack reseated the rifle against his shoulder and lined up the sights.He took three easy breaths and at the bottom of the last one, he squeezed the trigger.The weapon barked, and the butt stock again bit into his shoulder.Charlie was watching the target this time, and he said, Better.Not perfect, but youre getting there.I hit it?Real close, bro.Damn.Charlie rolled onto his back and locked his hands behind his head.Tell me about your weapon.Jack licked the sweat off his upper lip, and his mouth was filled with salt.Its an AN 23.Russian designed, gas operated, rotating bolt, 5.45 millimeter assault rifle.Fire modes include semi automatic, fully automatic, and two round burst.The burst mode utilizes a uhhh, blowback shifted pulse technology, ejecting both rounds before the recoil kicks in, and allowing you to hit the same spot twice with a single trigger pull.Or trigger squeeze.Okay, Charlie said.You read the manual.But tell me about your weapon.What?Tell me how it feels.How it smells.How it looks.Its a damn gun, Charlie.Its an automatic death machine.What do you want me to say?I want you to tell me about this specific gun, not how you feel about guns in general.What was the first thing they taught you when you were issued your weapon?They showed us how to take it apart, clean it, and put it back together.And why do you think that was?So we know how to maintain them in the field?Thats part of it, Jack.But they also wanted you to start forming a relationship with it.Start caring about it.Thats ridiculous.No, its not.You have to depend on it.Not like you depend on a friend, either.You have to trust it to do its job the way you trust your hand or your knee.It has to be part of you.But you wont let that happen.Youre too busy hating it, and you cant expect something you hate to save your life.Doesnt work like that, Jack.Jack grunted and wiped the sweat from his forehead.For the life of him, he couldnt figure out why he was a deluge while Charlie was dry as a bone.That fact was really starting to piss him off.Let me tell you something, Charlie said.Its not the weapon that kills people.The weapon is just an extension of someones will.Its a tool, no more good or evil than a shovel or a pen.Go right ahead and hate people who do evil things.Theyve earned it.But you have to learn to accept that weapon in your hands or youll never learn to use it.Fine, Jack said.Are you done preaching yet, Reverend?Just about.Do me a favor and take a good look at your rifle, and really get to know it.I know youve seen a lot of people killed by guns, but you have to let those ghosts go.Let them rest for a little while, and actually look at the tool right there in front of you.Jack cleared his head and did as he was told.He shook the rifle softly in his hands, and it was silent as a cloud.There was nothing moving or out of place.There was nothing to spare.He felt the roughened texture under his fingers which, contrary to his earlier thought, wasnt slippery at all.Not even soaked with sweat.He moved his head a little closer, took a whiff and picked up scents of raw metal, hot oil and the acrid tang of spent guncotton.Its three or four kilos.Center of gravitys around the base of the barrel, and the plastic parts feel gritty, like the tape we used to put on our skateboards when we were kids.It smells well, it smells like a freshly fired gun.Thats good.Now line up your shot and fire.Jack put the post on the center of his target and gently squeezed the trigger.In response, the weapon barked and there was a fast, nearly invisible flash at the tip of the barrel.It bucked into his shoulder but he was ready for it.Fifty yards away, a puff of smoke was wafting up from the center of the target.He tried not to let Charlie see him smile.Real good, Jack.Now do it again.And he continued to fire throughout the rest of the day.Chapter 25:  Womb  Come back to Legacy with us, Donovan had said, as casually as he might ask someone back to his quarters for dinner.The oddity of it struck Sal like a mallet.Shed resigned herself to Mars, and space travel belonged to her adolescence.It was all in the past.Launches on Mars were still dangerous and unpredictable business, events that all the children rushed to watch on the southern observation deck, with their mouths agape and eyes full of wonder.The tone in Donovans voice said that those days were over.The world had changed overnight, and space travel was about to become as dangerous and rare as a trip to the bathroom.He hardly needed to ask, of course.What choice did she have?It was so obvious that she was finished packing before she realized shed decided to go.When Kazuo found out that Sal was going, he invited himself along for the ride.She wasnt sure if he felt left out, protective, or some combination of the two, but Donovans precise reply was, The more the merrier.They suited up before nightfall and marched out to the skiff while the sun was setting behind the burnt horizon.When they reached the vessel, its circular portal opened and the ramp lowered lowered for them.She couldnt put her finger on what it was, but the ship seemed eager to meet them, and pleased once they were aboard.The world had become a strange place, and was getting stranger by the minute.Sal and Kazuo immediately started searching for seats to strap themselves into.Meanwhile, with a wave of Donovans hand, flat metallic panels around the ship became transparent and revealed the darkening Martian landscape shrinking into the distance.The ship was already up and away.Sal felt a soft jostle but nothing else.Were not actually flying, are we?Like hell were not, Donovan said.Dr.Rao, who struck her as nervous, chimed in.The ship uses artificial gravity to counteract inertia.You can hardly feel anything at all.Amazing, she said.Is it using artificial gravity for propulsion too?Oh no.It takes a rather extravagant amount of energy to project external gravity wells.Only larger ships like Legacy can afford such systems.Were still not completely sure what the skiff uses for propulsion, but I have theories.Rao always has a theory about something.Youll get used to it, Faulkland said gruffly.But how can you not know?Sal asked.You built this thing in two weeks and you dont even know what drives it.How is that possible?Donovan answered this time.The short answer is that we didnt build it.Legacy did, and I use the word built loosely.She grew the skiff the way we grow hair or fingernails.It and the tugs, which youll see shortly, should be considered components of the mothership.Theyre not sentient like she is, and theyd hardly function without her.Sentient ships and machines that were grown rather than built.Sal decided she would need some time to wrap her head around those ideas.The world was changing maybe just a little too fast.It was around then Kazuo tapped her shoulder and pointed into the distance.Sal was so wrapped up in her thoughts that she missed the shift from dusty sky to star filled space, and they were already rapidly approaching a massive green object in the distance.Like the skiff, it was far more organic than technological, but hinted at both in its own ways.It had two conjoined hulls, like some sort of space catamaran, and Sal very quickly put together that this thing was her planet killer.It was Donovans warship.The skiff came around Legacy, and Sal stared in awe at the vast ship glimmering in the light of the sun.As exotic as it was, there were still structures that reminded her of ships on Earth.She made out what appeared to be a bridge tower atop the larger hull, and the whole surface bristled with articulated towers that she figured were weapons, sensors or both.The skiff came to Legacys bow, and Sal got a good look at the front of the two hulls.They were similar in shape, but obviously different in function.The main hull gaped open, with the shadows of some dark machinery lurking within, while the smaller hulls mouth was covered in a complex pattern of overlapping panels which converged at the center.It had to be a hatch of some kind.Her suspicions were confirmed as the very center of it slid open just wide enough for the skiff to come inside.Once through the opening, they were in a different world altogether.The cavity was filled with blue green light, revealing structures all along the interior surface.The walls near the mouth were covered in a tangle of thick tubes, and behind them lay an uncountable legion of octagonal pads, all facing in toward the center of the chamber.They were all identical in every detail but size, each holding its own set of adjustable clamps, hoses and cables.Long, rectangular buildings split the pads into groups, and were themselves covered in small terraces and balconies.Other structures jutted out from the walls on thin stalks, like a forest of cradle topped trees.These grew progressively larger toward the aft, with the largest dwarfing even the vessel that carried Ares Colony to Mars.What is this place?she asked.This is the secondary hull, Donovan said.Its broken into separate compartments, each with its own purpose and unique equipment.This one would normally house and launch completed craft.Its a hangar.Man oh man, Kazuo said.Factory, carrier, battleship.Is there anything your ship doesnt do?Faulkland said, Only one thing so far land.Actually, theres plenty she doesnt do, Donovan corrected after a moment.She cant construct capital ships like herself, nor can she fabricate hollow drives her energy source.Thats going to be a serious problem soon enough.She has some trouble with internal repairs, and shes absolutely rubbish at math.Can you believe that?Still baffles me.I mean, she can count quickly, but thats about the end of it.Anything more complicated than that, she either does by intuition, or labels it Eireki stuff and leaves it for us.Sal didnt quite follow.What do you mean by intuition?Donovan took a moment to think.Lets say I throw you a ball and you catch it.Did you numerically calculate a parabolic arc, or did you just feel where it was going?Sal nodded.Understood.She can operate well enough doing a lot of things that way.She can figure out intercept vectors and orbits without a problem.Unfortunately, theres a whole host of other systems we cant use until we figure out the maths behind them.Sal noticed that the skiff had passed the landing pads and was continuing toward the other end of the chamber where another hatch waited.Were not going to land?Not yet, Donovan said.Shes giving you a tour.This hatch also opened as the skiff approached, but all the way this time, opening like a flower to the morning sun.The many thousands of panels folded, each into the next, and Sal was hypnotized by all the machinery working perfectly in concert on such a large scale.This chamber Donovan began to say.Is a shipyard, Sal finished his sentence.They had a distinctly alien flavor, but the bright orange docking rings were enough like wet docks in Earth orbit.She looked on excitedly and recognized the joints that would allow them to shrink or expand to accommodate ships of different shapes and sizes.Sal could puzzle out the uses of most of their tools, even with them lying dormant.A few were busy, constructing machines whose purposes she couldnt guess at.The manipulator arms ducked and dodged around their queries at an incredible pace, occasionally stopping to weld a seam and produce a shower of golden sparks.Sal looked deep into the distance, and there were rings as far as the eye could see.There are enough facilities here to work on hundreds maybe thousands of ships simultaneously, she said.Donovan nodded.Once production ramps up, yes, but we dont have the resources to put it all to use just yet.We will soon, though.The skiff drifted along, and Sal watched every set of docking rings pass.Each manipulator arm she looked at extended and reseated itself, like saluting a passing officer.They wanted her to know they were fully functional and ready to go.You said the ship reads minds?Give or take, Donovan said.Lets just say that Legacy is very sensitive to certain kinds of thoughts, and leave it at that.The skiff approached the end of the shipyard, and this time, there was a single mid sized hatch surrounded by thousands of smaller replicas.Those lead to the actual heart of the manufacturing complex, where components are gestated before being brought here for assembly.Past that is resource digestion.We can take a look at both if you like.Digestion?Donovan nodded.The tugs have their own ports in back where they deposit raw materials, which are then broken down for use in manufacturing.I make it sound technical, but its not pretty.Say no more.The inside of the skiff was quiet, as if everyone was waiting for someone else to speak.After far too long, Donovan smiled at Sal and asked, So what do you say?To what?she asked.He had a confused look on his face, as if the answer were as plain as day.Youll have to excuse me, he said, I have a bit of trouble with what has and hasnt been said sometimes.He gave the interface on the side of his head a quick tap.Sal had a sense she was being seduced, but into what she wasnt entirely sure.As far as she knew, shed been brought aboard to take a look around and help them design weapons.Or something.This facility has astronomical potential, but in order for that potential to be fulfilled, it needs someone to run it.It needs an inventive mind to give it purpose and direction.The answer dawned on her, and her eyes went wide with surprise.Id like you to run the factory, Donovan said.It would more or less be yours.This is too much, Sal said, and she started to wave her hands in front of her.Im just a wrench jockey.I fix things that are broken, Doctor Donovan.I dont run factories.I hope you dont take this the wrong way, but I know youre much more than that.Your work is inspired, and you know it, too.The woman physician, Doctor St.Martin, waved Donovan off.Christ, you havent a subtle bone in your body, Marc.Youre putting too much pressure on her.St.Martin had a warm smile and sharp, inquisitive eyes.Sal suspected this woman was their voice of reason, and the voice of reason went on, Why dont we put the skiff down and find some dinner?We can give Ms.Saladin a proper tour, and maybe show her some of the ongoing projects tomorrow.Does that sound alright?Sal thought about it for a moment.Everythings so damn weird, Im not sure whats alright anymore.But I guess thatll do.With that, the skiff headed back toward the launch bay, and no one spoke of Donovans offer for the rest of the night.Chapter 26:  The Weight  Marcus Donovan was floating in the middle of his quarters.The walls were in crystal mode, as hed taken to calling it, revealing the stars all around and the rust colored planet below.This was how he spent his down time; it was the closest he could get to the pure freedom experienced while reliving Legacys memory, back when she first plugged the interface into his head.He ached for that feeling, and the ache filled his thoughts and dreams.He just didnt know how to make his longing a reality.While rooting around inside her mind, he often tripped other memories, but they were only faded images and dim sensations in comparison.They werent the rich, sensory complete experience he had that first time.He literally lost himself and became her, and it was the single most transformative moment of his life.Now, she resided permanently at one edge of his consciousness, a friend and confidante, but whole, separate and complete.There was no commingling, no question where one ended and the other began.Sometimes, Legacy wondered why Marcus was so eager to be rid of himself.She thought Eireki were the most beautiful things in all of creation, and the desire to escape that existence totally baffled her.Truth was that being out among the stars was all Marcus had ever wanted, though, and he just couldnt ever explain it quite right.When it came right down to it, he wanted to be a ship.He consoled himself with the fact that for one titanic battle, hed lived his dream.It was more than most people could say.It still wasnt enough.He watched the stars and identified constellations for a while, until Legacy told him Amira Saladin was awake and inside the factory.The fact that Amira had trouble sleeping wasnt surprising.Most people had some difficulty their first night aboard, thanks to the heartbeat rhythm audible throughout the ship.Shes in the factory?Thats a good sign, he said out loud.Shell come around.I promise.Legacy told him again how excited she was by Amiras presence.The woman had a vibrant imagination, and saw possibilities wherever she looked.Her thoughts were different somehow, radiant like a bright light amid darkness.She was more like the Eireki of old, and Legacy found that especially invigorating.She told Marcus to go give Amira a nudge in the right direction.Youre not going to shut up about this, are you?The whole of Legacys being communicated the word No.Fine, he said, but let me talk to her alone.Really alone.No eavesdropping.The ship reluctantly agreed.Marcus floated back down to the floor, threw on a shirt and some loose pants, and headed out the door.At the end of the corridor was a landing pad and transit tube, which carried him several kilometers to the factory where Amira Saladin was silently looking over the machinery.She had the look of someone thinking heavy thoughts.She was leaning against a railing that overlooked an assembly line.The manipulator arms and their panoply of tools were at rest, just waiting for a job to occupy them.Marcus walked across the empty floor and took a spot next to her.She didnt react to his presence at all, but couldnt have missed him.She would talk to him when she was ready, he assumed.And after an eternity, she did.The future never quite works out how you expect, does it?Not as far as Ive seen.Life would be pretty dull if it did.Maybe.Itd be nice for a change, though.I mean, when I was a kid, before my family came to Mars, I never ever wouldve guessed Id become an engineer.You had something else in mind?She laughed.Yeah.Artist, all the way.I cant remember a time when I didnt have paint on my hands.And my clothes.And my face.My mother still has all the goofy little pictures I made.So what happened?Mars happened.For my parents, it was a once in a lifetime opportunity.The kind of offer they couldnt refuse, and me Well, I came along.Thats the only choice a teenager has.There are only a couple constants in the universe, and one of them is that being a teen sucks.So, I take it theres no market for art on Mars?I dunno.Things change, so maybe.Probably stupid landscapes.There wasnt back then, though.Arts a luxury, and when we first made planetfall, life was hard.A lot harder than anyone expected.We all worked our fingers to the bone in the early days, adults and kids alike.And thats how the painter became a wrench jockey.More or less.I had small hands, and I could reach where other people couldnt.I hated it.I hated it so bad that whenever I fixed something, I made sure it stayed fixed so I wouldnt have to fix it again.They both laughed for a while.When the silence returned, she spoke again.How about you, Doctor Marcus Donovan?What did you want to be?Me?I just wanted to be on Mars.Youre joking, right?Completely serious.There wasnt anything I wanted more.Rocketing through space, traipsing around alien worlds and meeting little green men.That was the dream, and Mars my first target.It was the only planet close enough to be realistic.The only one with the possibility of becoming more than a stupid kids fantasy.If its any consolation, you really didnt miss anything.There was nothing on Mars but rocks and hard work.I know.Id still have given my eye teeth just to hold one of those rocks, though.I had to make due with a crappy telescope, and by God, I kept my face glued to it from sunset to sunrise, just dreaming about all the places Id go if I got my chance.If you look close, Ive still got a dent on my cheek from the eye piece.She looked at his face and started to giggle.Oh God, I thought you were just saying that.I cheated, he said.Neglected to mention the part where my brother smacked the back of my head so hard that I needed ten stitches.What are brothers for, right?Thats terrible.Nah.It gave me character.Thats what mom said, at least.Sal smiled, but it faded quickly.So, you always knew you were going to outer space?She sounded wistful.Spose so.I went to university on a scholarship, got my degree in astronomy, and then it was straight into the Foundation.I got so wrapped up in the work that I kinda forgot about aliens and weird worlds, and just stared out into the unknown, hoping to discover some strange phenomenon to slap my name onto.Until you saw an alien ship.That was clearly a turning point for me.I bet I wasnt the first to see her.It just took someone half crazy to recognize what she was.Is that when you became Mr.Fix It?Yep.Doctor Donovan, patch kit and space gypsy.Most despised man in the Foundation, I reckon.How do you figure that?Say youre working on a project, and the suits inform you that Marcus Donovan is being transferred to your station.How would you take it?Like a slap in the face.Right.I got used to steely gazes and professional sabotage after a while.But it didnt matter because I had my eyes on the prize.A look of utter disbelief suddenly overtook her.Wait a minute, Donovan.Youre full of crap.Youre telling me your life turned out precisely the way you imagined it.Not precisely.Like you said, the future never turns out quite how you expect.In my case, I just got more than I wished for.More of what?Everything.I wanted to see new places and peoples.Instead, Ive got an alien warship plugged into my skull, and now this war The Earths lying in shambles, Legacy keeps telling me the fate of the galaxy is hanging in the balance, and Im the only person in a position to do a damn thing about it.Can you imagine that?No one likes having responsibility dropped on their shoulders, and Ill be frank with you Im the worst possible candidate for the job.Im not a general, or even much of a leader really.Im just an astronomer who likes to solve problems.They were both silent in the wake of that revelation.Marcus hadnt paid much attention to how he felt about it all.Hed just been along for the ride, doing whatever came naturally, and this was the first time he stopped to think about it.He wasnt entirely pleased at what he found.They both looked out over the sleeping factory for a long while, until Marcus finally spoke again.I know this isnt the future any of us expected, Amira, but whether we like it or not, its the one we were dealt.The fate of our race is hanging in the balance, and we need all the hands we can get.Even the little ones.She was still quiet.He decided it was time to leave, and let her make the right choice on her own.Before he left, he said one last thing.Well all collapse if we dont carry this weight together, and there wont be anyone left to pick us up.It was true: Marcus Donovan didnt have a subtle bone in his body, but sometimes subtlety wouldnt do.Chapter 27:  Cellular  With their training complete, the Bravos became a full fledged combat cell with Jack in command.They kept their ERC jumpsuits, whose colors had faded to dull brown during their long months in the dirt, and they added desert camo ponchos as further protection against the late summer sun.Charlie told them their first mission would be a warmup, requiring nothing more than basic competence.These types of missions were assigned to separate the wheat from the chaff.Successful cells moved on to greater challenges, while failures would either be drummed out of the organization, or simply swallowed up by the sands.Their assignment turned out to be just as simple as Charlie suggested.The Bravos were to head into the Gaza Strip to search for spare fuel cells, and conduct routine reconnaissance along the way.It was known territory with plenty of cover, and screwing it up would require real effort.The resistance always moved at night.During daylight, alien forces were everywhere, their cuttlefish flitting through the air and long legged walkers stalking the land.But at night, the alien forces dwindled to scattered foot patrols, and mankind made their moves.The darkness became their last refuge and final domain.No one knew why the alien activity dropped off after sunset, but there rumors and theories flew around in abundance.Most claimed the alien vehicles were a combination of solar powered and cold blooded.Jack meanwhile found a good chuckle in thinking the invaders were afraid of the dark.Nikitin had his own theory, based on the pet bird he had as a kid.The bird was a parakeet named Mister Whistles, and whenever the sun was up, Mister Whistles would tweet and twitter non stop.But if someone so much as dropped a blanket over his cage, hed go silent as a whisper.Lights out birdy.Nikitin called it the alien parakeet theory, and Albright was an unexpected supporter, preferring the more sophisticated sounding diurnal theory.Whatever the reason, daytime was off limits.The Bravos trundled out over rocky terrain in a military four wheeler with Corpsman Andrew Chase at the wheel, and arrived before sun up.They hid their vehicle beneath a dirt brown tarp on the outskirts of the farms, in the palm of a rock outcropping shaped like a hand thrusting out of the soil.The aliens werent known to be curious, but caution was rarely a mistake.Then the sun came up.The air turned hot and dry, but unlike Al Saif where the ground was a single shade of beige, the land near Gaza was fertile.Bountiful even.There was ample farmland full of fresh but abandoned crops, separated by pockets of damaged but standing buildings, while a scorch mark that used to be a city loomed off toward the coast.The Bravos found one of the sturdier bombed out and partially fallen buildings, and made camp for the day.Chunks had been taken out of it, but all three levels remained, and it made a good observation post, offering shady hiding spots and a bit of altitude in one crumbling package.Then the cuttlefish started to pass overhead.The air wasnt filled with them, but they went by often enough to remove any thoughts of stepping outside.There were a few patches of cover out there, but only separated by long stretches of open terrain.Without anti vehicle weapons, getting caught would equal a swift death.It was simple math.Jack busied himself studying maps of the area, trying to make some connection between the drawings and the wreckage all around, but he wasnt having much luck.The maps were the old folding paper style, which had hardly been used in more than fifty years.They were relics from a time before global wireless and teraflop pocket computers, and these particular specimens were woefully out of date.Despite being awkward to fold and more wrong than right, Jack still kind of liked them.There was something tactile that was missing in the digital versions, and since he didnt have anything else to do, trying to understand the maps made for an acceptable pass time.The others found ways to occupy themselves as well.Albright inventoried her first aid kit and ammunition, and Nikitin kept watch through the scope of his marksman rifle.Chase was playing some incomprehensible card game with Nick McGrath, who preferred to be called Trash for some reason he wouldnt explain.Rebecca Hartnell and Keith Cozar were staked out downstairs, where they could watch the northern corridor.Their hideout was silent for hours.Hot damn, those things are fast, Nikitin said sometime before noon.Hey Jack, how fast do you think thats going?Jack looked up from his maps and out over the farms.On the horizon, one of the four legged alien walkers was galloping by like some kind of monstrous Chernobyl gazelle.I dont know.How long do you reckon the legs are?Twenty meters?Sounds about right.Five, maybe six hundred KPH.Nikitin let out a dry laugh.I love the pause.Made it sound like you did some serious arithmetic before making a blind guess.You know me too well, Jack said, and folded his map.Chase and Trash snickered over their cards.Another moment later, four more walkers appeared in the distance.They were enemy vehicles, each carrying foot troops to parts unknown, but Jack couldnt escape the feeling of being out on safari, watching a herd of wild animals cross the plain.There was a lot of traffic, and he wondered if it was always like that.At 11:42 AM, things started to go wrong.Cozar came bounding up the stairwell.Incoming from the North.Walkers.Four or five.The enemy vehicles had impressive straight line speed, but they were slow and ponderous in close quarters.Compared to the cuttlefish, they were lightly armed and armored, with only a set of anti infantry guns to keep interlopers out from under them.The real threat was the two full extermination squads hidden within.A squad typically included four of the rhinos, heavy shock troops with autocannons and mobile artillery, and another five of the jackrabbits armed with long rifles, who acted as fast scouts and snipers.ETA?Jack asked.Three minutes.Maybe less.Their building was at the northern end of its pocket of ruins, with the rest of the buildings stretching to the South and West.To the East lay fields full of tall crops, beyond those another small group of ruins and then the rock outcropping where their four wheeler was stashed.Jack made the only decision he could in the face of overwhelming odds.Disperse and hide.Stay on the upper floors, keep your damn heads down, and hold your fire unless theres no other choice.The second you pull that trigger, were all dead.Cozar, get Hartnell and take up position across the street.Roger, Cozar said, and took off back down the stairs.Chase, Trash, cross that field and lay low in the next group of buildings, then head to the jeep the first chance you get.If things heat up around here, get the hell out of dodge.Then they were off and running as well.Nik, stay here and keep an eye on those two.If anything gets near em, take it down.The jeep is our top priority.Clear?Yes, sir.Good.Albright, youre with me.She acknowledged with a duck of her and shouldered her rifle.The weapon looked to be fully half her size.Down below, Trash and Chase emerged from the building and then disappeared into the tall rows of green crops.Their heads popped out every couple of steps, but Jack couldnt have seen them if he werent looking for them.Once he was sure those two were safe and on their way, he grabbed a couple empty drink bottles from the floor and tossed them in his pack.Then he waved Albright on and went up the final flight of stairs to the roof.The air above was clear.No cuttlefish or clouds.Just blue sky and bright sun.The walkers were approaching in the distance, still a few kilometers out, and raising a hell of a dust cloud behind them.Jack and Albright were four stories up, looking out across a strip of closely packed buildings.The gap between any of them was never more than two meters.He scanned the other roofs and spotted his target quicklya building abandoned while under constructionand he took off running.He chose Albright because theyd done some mountain ops together, and of anyone on his team, he knew damn well she could keep up.She was small but fast, and he figured shed been into gymnastics as a kid.She had that bouncing, energetic quality, and he could easily picture her whipping out a few somersaults and flips.Jack took a deep breath and he was off and running.His legs pounded across the dusty roof, then he was airborne for one long stride and landed on the next roof.He heard Albrights boots keep pace behind him.No time to stop and look.His breathing was falling into rhythm, and with another few strides, he was up in the air and then down again.This roof was lower, and he rolled with the landing, then was back to his feet and on the move.There was only one to go.With his final leap, Jack sailed through the open air and collided with the wall.In another second, he had his leg up on the ledge, and he clambered over.Albright was only a step behind.He hit the deck and took a moment to catch his breath.The tiny woman beside him was hardly warmed up, and Jack shook his head.Doesnt anything wear you out, he asked.Only one thing I can think of, she said.So, whats so great about this place?Youll see, he said.His breath came back under control and he hopped back up to a low crouch, then hurried across the half completed roof and dropped down into the top floor.He was glad to be back out of direct sunlight.Back under cover.A quick scan of the room revealed two things: enough unused ducting and lumber to hide in, and a pile of painting supplies in the corner.The supplies were what he was after.Hed seen the scaffolding outside when they first arrived, and it came to mind the moment he heard they had company.Bingo.He sat down with his back against the wall, where he could keep an eye on the window, then brought the drink bottles back out of his pack.He lined them up, three in total, grabbed a can of paint thinner from the pile and filled them one by one.Albright caught on.She drew her survival knife and started tearing strips from a canvas sheet, then handed them to Jack, who balled them up and jammed them in the tops of the bottles.The Molotov cocktail was a weapon as old as the hills, and hed seen first hand the kind of damage they could do to people.With any luck, the exterminators were just as susceptible.Youre not planning something stupid, are you hero?Me?Jack asked.Hell no.I just want a fallback if things turn from bad to worse.Roger that.She bounced off to scrounge a couple bottles of her own.Meanwhile, Jack peaked through the window, and could just see Hartnell and Cozar rushing through the building across the street with their rifles in hand.Jack grumbled that they needed to get down, and as if by remote control, they did.An alien walker strutted up to their settlement and stopped at the far end of the street, beside the building where Jacks team had been just moments before.In the distance, he could see other walkers had broken formation, and were milling around the other pockets of buildings.The nearby walker bent its long legs and lowered its small body to the ground, which then split open down the middle like a pea pod and released its contents.Jack counted eight rhinos and ten jackrabbits flooding into the street, just as he expected.The creatures split up once on the ground.That was out of the ordinary, according to briefings.The exterminators always worked in packs.The empty walker lifted back up to its normal height and began to pace the perimeter of the neighborhood.Albright returned around that time, hunched over an armload of various glass bottles.Whats going on out there?she whispered.Not sure.I thought they were after us, but this is way too much for seven sets of boots and a jeep.That doesnt look like a combat formation, either.Just a coincidence then?Maybe.Dunno.Christ, we have the worst luck.Each of the exterminators entered a building alone.If they knew about unfriendlies on location, that might work as a search pattern, but it was a reckless one that would rack up unnecessary casualties.Jack had trouble believing they were that careless.Never underestimate the enemy, and all that jazz.Then he waited.The thump of the rhinos massive feet echoed through the streets, and the jackrabbits made their strange tittering noises.Jack figured it was some kind of language, but it sounded like random clicks and yelps to him.Maybe there was still a linguist somewhere who could make heads or tails of it.The exterminators started to return after half an hour.They came with armloads of something Jack couldnt quite make out, and then would head back out to search for more.Their bounty was bright and colorful, whatever it was, and they built a pile where theyd been dropped off.He could only imagine the same was happening all over the Gaza Strip.He suddenly realized hed lost track of the walker, and found it again as it passed within feet of his window.Both he and Albright ducked and silently lipped curses as the alien vehicle filled their view and lumbered casually by.That was the closest look hed gotten at one of their vehicles, and every feature reinforced the feeling that it was a living, breathing creature of its own.Jack had no idea what to make of that, so he filed the thought away for later.He considered using the Molotov while the walker was in range, but put the idea out of his head as quickly as it appeared.With the way his luck had been, the walker would shrug off the flames, and then proceed to tear him to pieces with its anti infantry guns.He raised his head up for another look around and caught motion from the corner of his eye.It was Cozar standing in the window across the street, waving his arms like a madman.He was trying to get Jacks attention.When Jack signaled back, Cozar pointed down toward the ground floor and mouthed some words.Jack wasnt too great at reading lips, but managed to pick out, Get down.Theyre coming.It clicked.Jack grabbed the back of Albrights poncho, scrambled across the floor and slid into the pile of parts and debris.They found a small hollow and pulled a loose ventilation grate down for cover.It was only a few seconds before they heard footsteps in the stairwell, and then one of the jackrabbits marched into the room.The little bastard looked left and right carefully as he entered, then hopped and slowly walked across the floor.For a second, he looked like he was about the turn and leave, but then he saw the two rows of Molotovs sitting on the floor.Jack cursed his stupid rookie mistake.As quietly as he could, he clicked his rifles fire selector over to fully automatic, and got ready to gun the creature down.The jackrabbit crouched down and looked at the bottles.He put his ornate long rifle behind his back where some kind of clamp automatically latched onto it, then he picked up and examined one of the bottles.Jack had never been one for prayer, so he hoped Albright was gripping her crucifix for both of them.Then the jackrabbit lifted up his black mask and revealed the all too human face beneath.His mouth and nose were small, angular and elegant, in contrast with the huge, expressive eyes that took up half his face.He lifted the bottle to his nose, took a sniff and winced, then put the bottle back down and replaced his mask.He took one more look around the empty room and left.Son of a bitch, Jack said.Hed been holding his breath the whole time.Albright said, I coulda killed him.Knifed him.It wouldve been easy.The little doctor was always full of surprises.And when he didnt return, wed have to deal with the rest of the pack.True.They waited another ten minutes before climbing back out of their hole, during which time Jack didnt hear any gunfire, screaming, or any activity what so ever.It was a good bet his people were still alive.The exterminators strange hunt went on through the afternoon, and at the end they sorted their findings into stacks.Jack and Albright watched from the safety of their high window the entire time, only occasionally forced to duck as the walker again strolled by.Then, as dusk approached, the aliens loaded their bounty into the lowered walker, mounted up and left.Two rhinos and a single jackrabbit stayed behind, probably to make space for the cargo and wait for the next ride.Jack had no intention of staying overnight.Chapter 28:  Scarification  A couple minutes past sundown on the Gaza Strip, the sky was blue grey and the last shred of light was in its death throes when Jack heard the jeeps horn in the distance.There were two quick honks and then silence.A cattle call.The three exterminators at the far end of the street reacted immediately.The two rhinos made short, deep grunts between each other.The jackrabbits long pointed ears pricked up, then it pointed one of its long, clawed fingers across the fields to the East.The exterminators conversed for a few, then turned and headed to investigate, with the jackrabbit bounding out ahead and the rhinos lumbering behind.They disappeared into the distance, and several seconds passed before a rifle shot rang out, followed by a pained and plaintive cry.Jack and Albright hit street level and scurried from cover to cover, Cozar and Hartnell meeting them along the way.They moved down one side of the street with their weapons at the ready, and returned to the three story building thatd previously been their camp.There, they found Nikitin on the top floor with his back against the wall, next to the hole that had been his lookout.Stay down, he said, They didnt see me, and I aim to keep it that way.I clipped the little one, but it wasnt a kill.How far out?Nearly across the field.They grabbed their wounded and bolted for cover in the buildings.Good, Jack said.If Chase and Trash have a clue between em, theyll find somewhere to hide.So whats the next move, chief?Hartnell asked.Jack looked over the field.The crops were the only cover from one side to the other.They obscured vision, but offered no real protection, especially if the rhinos started shelling with their artillery.He had no choice, though.He couldnt just leave Chase and Trash to fend for themselves, and they needed that jeep.There were no reinforcements coming, and it was a damn long walk to Al Saif.Cozar and Albright with me.Hartnell and Nicotine, spread out and cover us.Nikitin opened his scopes lens cover.Im always staying behind.Price of being a good shot, Jack said with a snicker.Just think if you couldnt hit a school bus, you might be squad leader instead of me.Nikitin gave him a knowing nod.Right, right.Get a move on, joker.They flew back down the stairs and cut into the field as quickly as they could.It wasnt fast enough, and the worst possible thing happened.They were spotted.Something thumped hollowly in the distance.The air whistled above and stars raced down from the sky, exploding all around with bright flashes and brittle cracks.Get down!Jack yelled.He dove forward on top of his rifle, and listened to the shells hit one after another.One two three.Four five.Six.Two rhinos with three shells a piece.The enemy had to reload.Move it!he called out and climbed back to his feet.Thirty seconds to the next salvo.He kept his head down and raced forward, waving the others on with his hand.Jack couldnt see anything ahead but tall plants, and rushing through the dense crops made it felt like they were moving as fast as motorcycles.His boots crunched in the soil, and the sound of his ragged breathing filled his head.Then the distant artillery thumped again.Rifles cracked from behind them, cutting the artillery fire short.More stars fell from the sky, but before they landed, Jack and his team were already down on their bellies, ready to wait them out.The first went off far behind them, but number two was close.Too close.Jacks head rattled, his ears rang, and for just a brief second, he was somewhere else completely.Silence.Then he came surging back into the present, like surfacing from a deep water dive.Someone tugged at the back of his poncho, and he heard Albrights voice barking, Back on your feet, soldier!He cleared his head and climbed up.More artillery fire awaited them and the situation wasnt going to get any better.Break right!he called out.Head for the rocks and find cover.Jack?Ill be right behind.More rifle shots sounded, and in response, two streams of bright blue tracers streaked overhead.His support crew had caught the rhinos attention.Flash left, rush right, Jack said to himself as he produced one of the Molotov cocktails.He pulled a weather proof lighter from his pocket and lit the bottles wick, then cranked his arm back and chucked it as far as he could.An instant later, the light of a bright fire crackled some thirty meters on.One stream of enemy fire swept away from his support crew and towards the flame, while Jack ran the other way.Jack had forgotten how mind numbing a long run could be.Empty of any thoughts at all, he pounded his feet non stop straight past the buildings and back to the craggy rock hand where the jeep was stashed.The sky was finally dark when he got there, and he had to slow down to keep his footing.After a couple steps, he heard weapon safeties clicking.Wind, a voice said.Stone, he replied.It was a pass phrase, a challenge response set used to check for friendlies.There were dozens of others.Good to see ya, Jack!Hustle up, he said.Now that he had his head on straight, he had a plan.We dont have much time.Grab some cover in the rocks, and Chase lean on that horn.Chase pulled the tarp back over jeep and hit the horn, while the others hid.It was another cattle call, and they didnt have to wait long for the stampede.The rhinos moved in quickly.They werent cautious or subtle creatures.They were brute force personified, with as much armor and firepower as a light tank.They slowed as they came to the rocks, while the insectss on their backs produced glowing stalks to light the way.The behemoths grunted to one another in their weird language, and moved further into Jacks trap.Then the time came.The two rhinos stepped in front of the jeep and the headlights came on, blinding them.They each raised their thin, central arms to guard their faces from the light, all the while preparing to fire their huge autocannons.Their opportunity vanished.Trash and Albright opened fire into the rhinos backs.Bullets tore the insects to pieces, but sparked and ricocheted off the armor plates beneath.Cozar lit a Molotov and flung it into the air.It arced down and struck with a crash barely audible above the hail of small arms fire, then exploded in a shower of yellow orange flames.The monster at the center of the blaze roared in agony.Jack lit his own Molotov and cranked his arm back, but before he could throw, a high pitched crack sounded in the distance and the bottle exploded in his hand.Flames engulfed his arm, and he roared in pain.He dove to the ground and tried to smother his arm while another shot rang out.His right arm sizzled and popped beneath him, and he chewed on his lower lip while fighting the pain.He didnt even feel the heat anymore, just the sheer hurt.All the while, one of the assault rifles continued to rattle off rounds, and the rhino spun to aim at its attacker.Jack yelled to get down in half formed barks, but his team knew what they were doing.They were crazy as hell, but they had a plan.The rhino opened fire and angled its autocannon upward, the stream of burning blue rounds biting chunks out of the rock face, while Albright leapt down from her hiding spot and rushed up behind it.The nimble little woman sprang into the air and latched onto the monsters back.It spun around and futilely reached back to grab her, but she was faster.Her combat knife flashed out and slit its throat, spraying black blood to the earth.It was over.Jack was in more pain than he could swallow, but he was smiling.He must have looked right loony at that moment, as he grinned and looked at the two dead monsters in the dirt.One was lying on the ground still aflame, and the other lay in a lifeless heap with tiny Lisa Albright triumphant atop it.They didnt have time to celebrate, though.They needed to get out of town and fast.Jack stumbled back to his feet, slobbering in pain the whole way, and with a breaking voice said, Chase!Start the engine.Were getting the hell out.The engine sparked to life and rumbled.Everyone came out of their cover, while Albright cleaned and wrapped Jacks hand and gave him a shot of morphine to take the bite off his excruciating pain.The others removed the rhinos head with a fire axe, and heaved it into the back of the jeep, beside the creatures similarly liberated autocannon.When they were all loaded up, Chase pulled out and headed for Nikitin and Hartnells post.Jack sat in the back, slumped over to the side, and he managed to slip into a nice, deep sleep for the rest of the ride.Chapter 29:  Snare  The tents interior was dim in the spare sunshine that managed to seep inside, and Jack was looking down at his gauze wrapped hand.Six weeks had passed since the fight, and the roasted skin never stopped itching and aching.The burns could have been a lot worse, he admitted, but he was still short a hand.His good hand, even.He made due.He started carrying a forty five caliber handgun and learned to shoot left handed.That hand felt damn near useless and learning to aim reliably was a struggle, but after a bit of practice, it started to come around.He stretched his burnt fingers then made a fist, and had to grit his teeth against the pain.He had no room to complain, though.It took the surgeons a week to dig all the shrapnel out of Nikitins side, and he was still in a med tent somewhere recuperating.With a little luck, hed be back on the frontlines soon.Rebecca Hartnell didnt fair as well; she got caught in direct fire that night, and one of the rhinos autocannons took a fist sized chunk out of her shoulder.She survived, but it was a safe bet her left arm would never work quite right again.Despite her best protesting, she was taken off active duty and given a desk job in the armory.Considering all of that, Jack had made out alright.His hand would never be pretty, but it would work once he got the bandages off.Streaks of scarred skin twisted up from the hand towards his elbow, like permanently etched flames, and theyd serve as a reminder that the situation was never under control, no matter how simple it appeared.He stepped out of the tent and into the full light of day.The sun hung directly overhead, and a dusty canyon stretched off in two directions beneath him.Their camp was on the Sinai Peninsula, in a known high traffic area thirty klicks east of where the Suez Canal met the Red Sea.
