Fascinating, Kazuo said.Were ready to seal up here.Sal packed the faulty circuit board away and then lifted the steel panel up.It was the Quazlpacti who left the Nazca Lines on Earth, you know.To warn us against the dreaded gas monkeys of Jupiter, right?Nope.Just graffiti.The Quazlpacti were jerks.Kazuo stood and turned to give her a hand with the panel, but stopped and put his hands on his hips instead.His posture positively radiated frustration, and Sal was once again amazed at how much subtle body language made it through the bulk of the powered suits.Youre holding that panel up by yourself?You werent going to experiment on production units anymore, damn it.She laughed.I wasnt experimenting.Its just a little performance tweak.Tweak my ass, Kazuo said.The suits only rated to lift half that weight.She walked past him and lowered the panel over the exposed compartment, then punched the pressure seals into place.I wrote the spec, thanks.No need to quote it to me.Thats not the point.Its not safe, Sal.What if your tweaks fail and five hundred kilos of steel come tumbling down on you?What then?Then my stalwart yet officious partner digs me out and carries me back to the airlock.She gave Kazuo a nudge in the ribs, which he certainly didnt feel.Those are the dangers of frontier engineering, soldier boy.Better get used to it.With the panel sealed up, they both marched back toward the eastern airlock at a pace much slower than their suits were capable of.After a long silence, Kazuo said, Youre really aggravating, you know that?Of course I know it, Sal replied.Its why you like me so dang much.Kazuo groaned, and Sal took it as a sign of affection.Kazuo wasnt the kind to let his positive emotions bubble up to the surface, but it meant they burned twice as bright deep down inside.At least, thats what Sal told herself while she continued to dig around for them.By the time they reached the airlock, the sandstorm was still brewing in the distance, and hadnt made much progress.Sal wouldve been delighted if it never bothered to come together at all.The sound of stones battering the colonys outer shell always ruined her concentration in the lab.The airlock doors closed behind them and the chamber began to pressurize, a process made agonizingly slow by obsolete, decrepit airlock hardware.The old tech did its job, though, and just well enough that Sals requests for replacements from Earth were ignored.Since they were all mission critical systems, she wasnt even allowed to experiment on them.Not the slightest little bit.Tell me something interesting about Mars, Kazuo said, looking to kill time.Sals mind was still on those annoying, tiny little rocks.Did you know that ninety percent of the rocks currently on Mars were brought here by the original colonists?Is that so?Kazuo asked.Absolute fact.The Martian landscape, as originally seen by the Viking probes, was mind numbingly boring, so the colonists brought rocks with them to liven up the scenery.A quarter of the colonists were landscapers by profession, and they spent the first three years carefully arranging them, like some kind of giant Zen garden.Incredible, he said.What about the sandstorms?Ruined all of their hard work over and over again, until they finally gave up trying.The pressure was half way there.Tell me something interesting about Earth, she said.He took a moment to think.Kazuo wasnt the imaginative type, so he tended to answer with actual, interesting facts.Or things he thought were interesting, but often times werent.Did you know he droned out as he tried to think of something, that when Yuri Gagarin first orbited Earth, the Great Wall of China was the only man made structure visible from space.I did know that.Oh.And its not true.Damn.An uncomfortable silence persisted until the green pressure light came on and the internal doors parted, revealing the mission readiness bay.The oblong room was filled with standard GAF pressure suits hanging on racks, as well as a half dozen of Sals MASPEC powered suits, which faced the wall with their backs open.Sal and Kazuo marched inside and each stepped up to a mechanical docking clamp, which held MASPECs while their pilots climbed out.A person wasnt strong enough to remain upright once the suit powered down, and attempts to escape were quite comical when they didnt result in serious injury.Sal pulled herself out of the back of her suit and retrieved the faulty circuit board from its hip pack while Kazuo was still going step by step through the power down procedure.As usual, she found his tenacious grip on procedure endearing in a ridiculous sort of way.Her comm headset rang.Yeah?Hey Sal, its Rachael.Are you back yet?That was Rachael Peretz, a communications operator wholike Salhad come to Mars as a child with the first wave.Sal had babysat her once upon a time, and they were close friends now.She silently hoped this wasnt another gab session about the cute sounding boy on the Shackleton Expedition.She didnt think shed survive another one of those.Just climbed out of my suit.Whats up?Something weird.Can you come to the Comm Center and give me a hand?A technical mystery.Sal considered it a minor blessing.Ill be there in five.Saladin out.She snatched the duty jacket from her locker and took off on an Ares sprint.With gravity only a third of Earths, the Martian colonists had learned to run upwards of forty kilometers an hour, and jump several times their own height.It was one of the skills that separated long time colonists like Sal from more recent transplants like Kazuo, whod dislocated his shoulder several times trying.Sal flew through one corridor after the next, and then started braking by leaning back and scraping her feet along floor.The motion was rather like skidding down a long hill.She came to a perfect stop in front of the Comm Center door, and it slid open in front of her.Hey, whats going on, Rache?Rachael waved her over, and Sal stepped up to her friends workstation.The screen showed a graph of a waveform drawn in sharp right angles.It was a digital signal.Alright.What am I looking at?It all started two days ago.The infra red receiver blacked out, and at first, we thought it might be solar flare interference, but then it started to happen regularly.Each blackout lasted forty five minutes, followed by the receiver returning to normal operation for forty five.Weird.Yeah, I thought so too.Some of us thought it might be a software problem, or a piece of equipment faulting out.But it wasnt?Nope.Turns out, were being hit by an infra red laser thats overloading the photodiode.And get this its coming from Earth.Earth.No one was talking about it anymore.They hadnt heard anything from home for more than two months.At first they assumed it was some minor technical problem, or a bout of nasty solar weather.Then, as the silence stretched on, theories of all sorts started to fly, from a nuclear war to some kind of global communications collapse caused by terrorists.Then the conversation just died.There was no way to know what was going on, so they stopped trying to guess.Once we tuned down the receivers sensitivity, I started analyzing the beam, and I found this signal embedded inside.She pointed to the screen.And you think someones trying to talk to us?Yeah, Im pretty sure.I havent been able to decode it, though.I was hoping youd take a look.Sal realized her jaw was hanging open.She closed her mouth and stared at the screen for a moment, and tried not to imagine what it could mean.Yeah.Ill do that, she said.Add me to the comms working group, and Ill take a crack at it.Thanks, Rachael said, and until we know whats going on, lets keep this quiet, alright?No need to panic anyone.Sure thing, Sal said, and she stayed for several long minutes, watching the peaks and troughs of the signal stretch across the screen.Chapter 20:  A Call to Arms  Marcus Donovan was deep inside Legacys secondary hull, her factory complex.From the observation platform where he stood, he looked out over a cavernous chamber lit in blue green and filled everywhere with activity.The Shackleton Explorer was there, docked inside a series of orange constructor rings whose countless biomechanical arms twitched about and inspected the vessel.Legacy wanted to know more about human technology, and they both agreed the most direct route was to take a closer look.Faulkland was against it at first, but after six weeks of constant badgering, he finally caved and reluctantly allowed his boat to be brought inside.The last of Shackletons crew moved to more comfortable quarters aboard Legacy, although the engineering team maintained a presence on the Shackleton to monitor its nuclear reactor.The chief engineer, Olli Enqvist, insisted the reactor was perfectly safe and could operate itself, but he preferred to err on the side of caution.Marcus smelled subtext.All the while, Legacy was in a state of transformation.She had been quiet and despondent when she woke up, but the crews presence raised her spirits.Marcus didnt completely understand it, but humans invigorated her somehow.She had been incomplete without them; now she was filled with purpose and an eagerness to please.Legacys factory especially had become a constant hub of activity.She quickly constructed a small fleet of utility vessels shaped like pill bugs, which the miners called tugs and adopted as their own.With the miners as their pilots, the tugs swarmed out to assay and retrieve asteroids, feeding them to the factory complex which hungrily digested tonne after tonne of ore.This led to the construction of yet more tugs, some of which joined in acquiring minerals, while others went about repairing Legacys hull.Repairs across Legacy were moving faster than anyone expected, thanks primarily to the efforts of Juliette St.Martin, whose insights into the alien technology were unmatched by any of the engineers.Legacys internal systems more closely resembled biological structures than they did machines, and healing her was more like medicine than car repair.Being an exceptional physician with plenty of experience and a keen interest in alien biology, Juliette was the perfect woman for the job.Marcus suspected Juliette and Legacy were bonding in ways he never could, and the ship all but confirmed it.She was in fact growing quite fond of the doctor, and Marcus felt a twinge of jealousy which he realized was utterly absurd.The most confounding part was that he couldnt figure out which of the two he was more jealous of.The rest of the team were busy adapting their equipment to Legacy by trial and error.Mostly error.The ship learned to produce compatible electrical outlets after a bit of practice, so power wasnt an issue, but all attempts to mate their computers to her information network failed.They were forced instead to setup their systems in tandem with hers, including a comm system which she essentially ferried signals to and from.Rao likened it to visiting a cutting edge radio telescope and then being forced to use ones own Victorian spyglass.As Marcus stood there in the factory watching the machines do their work, Legacy repeated a request which shed made a dozen times already.She explained that whole swaths of her memory had faded during her eons long slumber, and she needed new patterns to fill in the gaps.Specifically, she wanted to dismantle the Shackleton and analyze its construction.She was sure she could interface with the crew more easily if she could better mimic their technology.Marcus had done his best to put the decision off, but she was becoming more insistent.The honest truth was that the decision wasnt his to make, though; the Shackleton wasnt his ship.And even though he was now a permanent resident aboard Legacy, he doubted the rest of the crew were so enthusiastic about the idea.Dismantling the Shackleton would mean total commitment, and there could be no turning back.Alright, Ill ask him, Marcus said.He closed his eyes, looked around for Faulklands position, and received a picture of the Commander seated in one of the recreation facilities.They were like indoor parks, complete with simulated sun, wind and sky, and the crew had become enamored with them.The ship was also working on artificial grass, and by all reports was getting damned good at it.Marcus spoke, and the ship echoed his voice at the Commanders location.Donovan to Faulkland, please meet me in the Shackletons docking bay.Then he leaned over the railing and waited, watching the constructor rings arms gingerly probe the Shackletons surface.Less than a minute later he heard the whoosh of the transit tube, followed by the dull clack of Faulklands boots on the hard floor.Whats on your mind, Marc?Faulkland was a straight shooter, and Marcus figured it best to come straight out.She wants to dismantle the Shackleton.Hell no.Fair enough.I told her youd say that, but she still wanted me to ask.She wants to improve how she interacts with us, and she thinks the most direct way would be to tear the Shackleton down and replicate its interfaces.Faulkland leaned over the railing next to Marcus, and he too watched the small insectoid arms examine his ships hull.Do you know how long I had to waited to get my own explorer?I ran freight to the moon and back for ten years, Marc, then Mars for another three just to get my name on the list.This ships the only thing I ever wanted.I know, Marcus said, and shes a beauty.Best we ever built.Dont exaggerate.Seed I now that was a piece of work.Brought a whole dang colony to Mars.I know it only had to do its job once, but man I woulda liked to be there to see it.Still amazed that it worked at all.You and me both.How about the best I ever built then?Faulkland laughed.See, thats just it, Doc.The Shackletons just another project to you, another toy for you to fix, wind up and send along its merry way.You dont understand that shes my ship.Shes my purpose.For the first time in his life, Marcus was in a place to understand what that meant.He had no intention of moving on ever again, because hed found his purpose and he was ready to spend the rest of his life aboard her.This may surprise you, Commander, but I get it.Im understanding it better every day.Legacy understood, too.She considered the bond between ship and crew to be sacred.A crew was her purpose, her reason for being.A way to solve both of their problems occurred to her, and she passed it along to Marcus.Shes wants to offer you something in return, Marcus said.I cant imagine what would make me change my mind.Marcus turned towards him with an earnest look in his eyes.How about a new a ship?Come again?A number of faint memories flew through Marcus head, different ships of different types.Once Legacy has adapted her systems for our use, shes promised to build you a new Eireki cruiser.No more primitive fission reactor or spinner section.Were talking about a hollow drive powered, trans atmospheric living ship with artificial gravity, able to make the trip from Earth to Mars in eight minutes flat.Faulkland was silent for a long time while he looked at his ship and considered.Eight minutes to Mars?he asked.Eight minutes.He turned to Marcus and motioned to his own temple.I dont need one of those things, do I?The neural interface on Marcus head had grown during the two months since it was attached, and the sight of it still disturbed the crew.He could hardly blame them.No neural interface.Thats the point of pulling the Shackleton apart, right?Good.I want to bond with a ship, but I dont really want to bond with a ship, if you catch my drift.I dont need anyone else in my head.So thats a yes?Marcus asked with a tentative smile.Yeah just do it before I change my mind.I get input on the new ships design, too.Of course, Marcus said.She wouldnt have it any other way.Faulkland tapped his comm headset.Faulkland to Enqvist, are you aboard the Shackleton?Marcus heard the transmission echo through his interface.Yes, sir, Enqvist said.Shut the reactor down, and then join us on Legacy.Sir?Were scuttling the ship.Roger.Does the big beast know how to deal with a hot reactor, sir?Faulkland looked to Marcus who nodded.Donovan claims she does.Im inclined to believe him.Aye aye, sir.Inserting control rods now.Ill be out in five.Over and out.The Shackletons running lights went out and true to his word, Enqvist came out four and a half minutes later.He waved up at the platform, and the constructor rings arms immediately began pulling the ship apart and examining each component.Faulkland grimaced, but didnt look away.Its like watching a spider eat a fly.Legacy checked Marcus memory for images of spiders and was slightly offended at the comparison.Marcus didnt feel the need to pass that along.Both men watched the carnage for several moments more, until an incoming message interrupted them.Shen to Faulkland and Donovan.Weve just received a priority encrypted transmission from Ares Colony with your names on it.On our way, Faulkland said.He continued to watch his ships destruction for another second, then they both headed for the tube and left for the bridge.The trip took them from the factory to the primary hull and more than another kilometer to the bridge, all within thirty seconds, after which they were lowered down to the landing pad on the other side.Faulkland marched double time to Masons station down on the second tier, while Marcus used the gravity systems to fly there directly.This new trick left a look of surprise on everyones face.The transmission came straight from the office of the Colony Administrator, and requires both your biometric keys to decode.Its pretty big.Would you like it transferred to private quarters, sirs?No need, Faulkland said, and placed his right hand on a lit pad where its measurements were scanned and converted into a decryption key.When he finished, Marcus did the same.A progress bar crawled across Masons monitor, and then flashed to say it had finished.The archive contains two separate files: a brief message from Ares and another larger file labeled Radio Free Copernicus?Marcus cocked an eyebrow.Play the message from Ares, he said.The screen went black and then showed Administrator Saladin, the greying but still potent head of Ares Colony, seated at his desk.The Great Seal of Mars was behind him, the Roman god of war posed triumphantly atop a caricature of Olympus Mons, motioning across the barren Martian plains.The administrator straightened his shirt and received a cue from someone off screen, then began.This is a priority transmission to the heads of the Shackleton Expedition.As youre aware, Earth has been silent for the past seventy four days, and weve been monitoring the situation with cautious optimism.Today, we received and decoded a transmission that, if true, surpasses even our greatest fears.While were still working to confirm its veracity, Ive decided to send you an unaltered copy.We would appreciate any thoughts you and your specialists might have, and we patiently await your response.Be blessed.With that, the transmission ended.That was cryptic, Faulkland said.And ominous, Marcus added.Mason, go ahead and load up the other file.Mason tapped at the keyboard a couple times, and the other transmission began.This time, the screen showed a video feed of the Earth from orbit in crystal clear and excruciating detail.The northern edge of the Amazon was visible, as was the horribly defaced northern coast of South America.The former territories of Venezuela, Guyana and Suriname were blackened husks, as if some force had simply burnt them away.Even more striking were the two blue circular structures that had taken root in the rainforest, each measuring nearly twenty kilometers across.Tendrils spread out from them, reaching into the embattled jungles which were being overtaken by some kind of orange and purple growth.It looked like an infection.Legacy was noticeably silent in Marcus head.A voice accompanied the video feed, and Marcus thought it was familiar.from here, you can just barely see what remains of Trinidad.I went there for vacation last year, and lemme tell you, it was a hell of a time.Great food.Good music.I suppose I can go ahead and add that to the list places Ill never see again.And now for a station break.For those of you just joining us, this is Nils Jansen for Radio Free Copernicus, your eye in the sky in these troubling times.The footage is, as always, streaming live from our position three hundred and twenty kilometers high above the Earth.But how did this happen?Well, its a funny story.Actually, its not really funny, but humor me It all started about seventy four days ago  Soon, all of the crew were on the bridge, and they watched the forty five minute transmission from beginning to end in stunned silence.When it was over, they watched it again.As the second play through finished, Faulkland asked the question on everyones mind.Is it the Nefrem?Marcus didnt know and Legacy was confused.The enemy shouldnt have had any reason to come to the Garden.The whole system should have appeared dead and uninteresting to them.She was sure of it.The invaders craft and tactics were unfamiliar, too.Then again, a lot things can change in sixty five million years.I dont know, he finally said.Maybe.If it is, Legacys not strong enough to engage them.Not yet.We need more time.What about the men on Copernicus?Sarah Park asked.They dont have much time left, sir.Jansen had been clear about that fact.Their rations were running low, and he didnt know how much longer they could hold out.We have to hope someone on Midway heard them.Im sorry, but theres nothing else we can do.Park didnt seem satisfied with that answer.Marcus put his hand on Mason Shens shoulder and said, I want you to send a priority classified message to Administrator Saladin.What should it say, sir?Transmission source confirmed and considered reliable.Shackleton Expedition now en route to Mars aboard new vessel.ETA three weeks.Tell them we aim to retake Earth, and to prepare for war.Chapter 21:  Reunion  The old cargo plane brought them in under the cover of night.The world was just as black above as below in the absence of electrical light, and Jack had never before seen a darkness so deep or thick.So all consuming and complete.He slipped in and out of consciousness, each time troubled by the same dream.In it, he was adrift on a shiftless sea of black ink attached to an impossibly large tattoo needle which etched portraits of the dead on the worlds aging, wrinkled skin.Jack despised when his dreams waxed poetic.Why couldnt he have nice dreams about sunny beaches in Cancun?After God only knew how long, the plane made a steep descent and then rumbled along a rough patch of road.When it came to a halt, the rear cargo ramp lowered and revealed the dim lights of civilizations last gasp.The makeshift runway was lined with hooded lamp posts which lit the ground but were invisible from above, as well as the same oil drums, stacks of crates and wooden pallets found at every small airfield.There were soldiers spread everywhere, dressed in unmatched uniforms and carrying a motley assortment of small arms.Mashriq soldiers in red berets jogged over to the plane and ushered its passengers down the ramp.Each spoke in a different language.Welcome to Al Saif.This the base of the sword.Exit the vehicle and bring all of your belongings with you.You will not have another chance to retrieve them.New recruits report to the registrar at the far end of the airstrip.Welcome to Al Saif.This is the base of the sword  Jack, his corpsmen, and the cargo planes other fifty bruised and dirty passengers hurried down the ramp and went where the soldiers fingers directed.They found the registrar seated at a shabby desk at the end of the airstrip, and he was just another soldier but with a clipboard instead of a rifle.The recruits lined up single file, were asked a few questions, then signed their names and were hustled along to the next stop.Jack formed a theory that the enlistment, which involved constantly moving from one station to another, was intended to disorient them.Combine that with their lack of sleep and empty stomachs, and the recruits were left in an exceptionally pliable state.After an hour of being spun in circles, they found themselves on wooden benches inside of a long building made of spare corrugated metal.Harsh light came from lamps overhead, and the walls were decorated with posters in primary colors, depicting soldiers charging victoriously on cowering foes.This is the last damn place I ever expected to end up, Jack said to Nikitin.Come on, Jackie boy.Replace the soldiers in those pictures with medics and firefighters, and this aint so different from your first night in the Corps, is it?He thought back to the training camp in San Diego.He was a lot younger then, fresh faced and full of optimism, but the scene was just about the same.The ERCs hall was bigger, its decorations more grandiose, but it was basically the same.Just you watch, Nikitin said.In about five minutes, some puffed up little Major will waltz up to that podium and start barking about the proud tradition of the organization.Then hell get all pissed off and make an example of someone.I hope its me.I never get to be the example.Nik, youre a constant example to us all, Jack said, and Nikitin let out one of his belly laughs and jabbed at Jacks shoulder.Nikitins prediction came true two minutes early.A man in camo pants, combat boots and a brown tank top marched up the center aisle.He had curly dark hair and several days worth of growth on his face.His dog tags swung out from his chest and back again with each step, and he examined the recruits with bright wolfen eyes.He walked to the front of the room, turned on his heel and just stood there for a long moment.It wasnt clear whether he was gathering his breath, his thoughts, or just taking a moment to let everything sink in.Welcome to Al Saif, he said finally.I am Colonel Galili, and Im in charge of new recruits here.First, I would like to thank each of you for coming.As you know, this is a desperate war we wage.A war that will determine the fate of our race.We will either regain our world, or we will perish and fade into the sands of history.This depends on you, and Im glad to see so many of you pledging yourselves to the cause.Nikitin elbowed Jack in the ribs.Thats a little different, he whispered.The colonel continued, The invaders have struck a terrible blow to our people.Our cities are burnt.Our civilization is destroyed.What was is no more.Yet for all their strength, the enemy has made a grave oversight They allowed us to survive.They destroyed our cities, and yet our spirit rages on, unvanquished and undying.He motioned to someone in the first row.You.Tell me why youre here tonight.To kill the bastards.Im ready to die for the cause.I see, the colonel said.Who else feels this way?Hands floated up around the room and voices murmured in agreement.He shook his head.Noble, but we cannot allow ourselves to think like this.It is the mindset of a victim.The victim is content to spit in his enemys face before he dies.We must not be victims.Instead, we will become weapons.I ask you, is a weapon prepared to die?No.A weapon is a machine.It is cold, calculating and efficient.A weapon survives so that it may kill again tomorrow.That is its purpose.I know you are filled with anger and hatred, and you are willing to sacrifice your lives, but this must not be so.For the sake of our people, our mission must be greater than this.We must preserve ourselves survive beyond the struggle, and not only destroy the enemy, but dominate them.We must drive them from our world, and show them the price of their arrogance.Now, it is true that we face an enemy of staggering power.The force which these invaders have brought against us is without precedent in the history of our world, yet they are not omnipotent.They can be defeated and killed.Can anyone tell me what strengths we possess?Galilis question met silence, and he smiled.How about this?We have knowledge.This is our world, and we know her terrain, her weather, the hidden secrets of the land itself.That is a strength.Our enemy is large and rooted in place, while we are fluid and agile.When they believe theyve found us in numbers, we will disperse and regroup.That is a strength.Our enemy is loud and obtuse, but we are quiet, subtle and cunning.That too is a strength.The room was full of nodding heads.So you see, we have many strengths which the enemy cannot steal from us.Strengths which they cannot neutralize.We must exploit each strength to its fullest, and use them to destroy the enemy wherever he stands.Our victory then is not only attainable; it is inevitable.Harbor no doubts about this fact we will be victorious.In our hearts and in our minds, we must look always toward victory, and we must seize every opportunity to strive closer to it.Are there any questions?A man somewhere in the middle of the room raised his hand, and Colonel Galili motioned to him.When do we get to kill some damn spacemen?he asked.Soon enough.You will train here for the next month, and then receive your assignments.Everyone with previous military experience will be fast tracked.The question and answer session went on for another twenty minutes, covering topics from weapons and organization to what was known about the invaders, which didnt amount to much.When the activity began to quiet down, Jack had his own hand in the air.Colonel Galili pointed to him.Will we engage civilian targets?Jack asked.The colonel had to stop and think.It wasnt a question he had a prepared answer for.Im not sure there even are civilians among them, to be honest.We have only seen their termination squads thus far.I see that youre with emergency response.Would it bother you if we did?When Jack spoke, it was like the words came from someone elses mouth.No, sir.Good.We cannot afford to show the enemy more compassion than he has shown us.There were still hands in the air, but the colonel waved them off.Thats enough for one night.The sergeant outside will show you all to a warm meal and a bunk, and well pick up in the morning.That is all.The exhausted recruits stood up from the benches and slowly shuffled out the door, Jack and his team trailing at the back of the crowd.The air outside was cool and crisp, and there was a gentle wind blowing.He was glad to be outdoors again.A Carbon Corporation sergeant stood off to the side, waving the recruits on toward the mess hall, every centimeter of him an example of Carbons commitment to technological warfare.He wore a suit of their standard charcoal black armor, made from an impact resistant polymer that was the source of Carbons vast wealth, as well as a bulky helmet covered in optics and air filters.Slung over his shoulder was a Blade Firearms XM 5 assault rifle decked out with all the options.Even banged up and covered in a layer of dust, his equipment was the envy of armies the world over.As Jack approached, the sergeant unexpectedly stepped up and stopped him with a quick shove to the chest.His other hand reached back to his rifle, ready to bring the weapon forward.Where do you think youre going, Corpsman?he asked.The helmet modulated his voice and made it sound inhuman and mechanical.Im detaining you under suspicion of sedition.Jack was too tired for this shit.He shook his head and readied a string of expletives, but before he could unload them, he noticed something strange: the nametag beside the double crescent Carbon Corporation logo said Hernandez.What the Charlie?The sergeant popped his helmets latch and levered the face mask up, revealing Charlie Hernandez mischievous smirk inside.Bro, you shoulda seen the look on your face.You son of a bitch, Jack said, and before he knew it, his arms were wrapped tight around his little brother.He couldnt remember ever hugging Charlie.Not by choice, at least.He guessed that was a sign of just how much the world had changed.They pulled away after a few seconds, and Charlie gave him a friendly punch to the shoulder.How the fuck did you survive, Jack?You wouldnt believe me if I told you.We crashed in China  Dont be modest, Nikitin said.Your big brother saved our cans back there.Landed a half destroyed leviathan smack dab in the middle of the invasion.China?No joke, Charlie said.Man, I havent heard anything good coming out of the east.Nothing good to say, Jack said.Its hell over there.How about you?Long story, Charlie said.His hands became animated as he spoke.We were hip deep in the shit fifty klicks outside of Cairo when it started.We had some insurgents pinned down, and then the damnedest thing happened.Four hundred guys in a firefight stopped shooting and just looked up at the sky, like someone hit pause.Next thing you know, the fight didnt seem so important anymore.We called a cease fire, and ended up trading war stories with em all night.And you came back here?Yeah.Aliens are thick as locusts to the South, so well, we advanced to the rear and didnt stop until we hit the Dead Sea.Probably just dumb luck, but soldiers from all over hell were already here, and Al Saif just sorta happened.Charlie looked the group up and down.Anyway, weve got plenty of time to catch up, but you guys look like crap.Lets get you a warm meal and some bunks, eh?Charlie was right.They looked like crap, and they felt twice as nice.Together, they went to the mess hall laughing, and Jacks team ate the first warm meal theyd seen in months.Chapter 22:  Red Carpet  They said aboard new vessel?Whaddya think that means?Sal had tapped into the orbital traffic system, and she was watching her monitor for any kind of strange activity.She didnt bother to look away as she answered him.Ill tell you what Ive been telling my father for the past three weeks, Kaz.I dont fucking know.The lab was quiet and dim, just the way she liked it.Other than her monitor, the only light in the room came from a series of faintly blue neons hanging over the large worktable.That table was covered in tools and small bits of mechanical flotsam and jetsam, pieces of experiments in various states of completion.Other larger projects in various states of assembly were arrayed along the walls.Kazuo was leaning against Sals desk, idly toying with the gears of a broken servo which occasionally let out a whir.I mean, where could they even get a new vessel?I bet the expedition was just a cover for a secret military project.Sal reached out and snatched the servo from his hands, then set it down next to her keyboard.Maybe, but the Foundation wouldnt have any part of that.They take non proliferation seriously.Sure, but what if they were conned.The way they changed the Shackletons mission all of a sudden smelled mighty fishy to me.Maybe Donovan works for Blade Aerospace.Sal considered what she knew about Donovan and his Gypsies.Hed become one of Sals heroes over the past few years for his ability to get jobs done despite bureaucracys best efforts.He was a divisive figure in the Foundation for precisely the same reason, and there were always rumors flying around about him.But this was the first time shed heard anyone accuse him of working for a military contractor.It was damn near heresy.Kazuo had been a Carbon Corp soldier before he came to Mars though, and nobody slung conspiracy theories like military men.Every single one shed met saw hints of secret dealings wherever he looked, and that fact disturbed her to no end.Let me see if Ive got this right.You think that Marcus Donovan, a well known and respected astronomer, was hired by Blade to construct an experimental, not to mention illegal, warship in Earth orbit?Plus or minus.Just tossin ideas at the wall, seeing what sticks.Sal was badly in need of an aspirin.I guess that makes as much sense as anything else these days.The one thing she knew for certain was that this new vessel had to be fast, whatever it was.Fast enough to cross two hundred and thirty million kilometers in three weeks.She was familiar with the Shackletons engines, and the ship just wasnt up to snuff.It would need to accelerate for more than three straight hours to achieve that kind of velocity, and there was no way it could carry enough reaction mass.The math just didnt add up.Not that it was any easier to believe Kazuos theory.An advance in propulsion technology that revolutionary would be impossible to hide.The cost, the complexity, the testing.There would be too many people involved and it was just too big to cover up.That was the thought running through Sals head when the alerts started to sound.Red lights and klaxons went off across the colony, and Kazuo jumped out of his skin.What the hells going on?God damn it!Sal shouted over the noise, and she punched the keyboard.Incoming asteroid.Big and hot.What do we do?She shook her head.Pray, was all she said.The blip streaked across the display and she watched it with wide eyes.It had to be ten kilometers long or more, and was coming at them like a bullet.It was a planet killer, and they should have seen it years ago.Her breath caught in her throat and her thoughts were eerily silent.Wasnt she supposed to see her life flash before her eyes in a situation like this?Then, as suddenly as it appeared, the object slowed to around two kilometers per second and dropped into orbit around Mars.Sal started to breathe again.Kazuo was standing behind her with his fingers digging into her shoulders.What just happened?he asked.Im not sure, she said, but I hope thats Donovans new vessel.It took ten minutes for someone to finally shut the alarms off, much to Sals chagrin.She still hadnt found any aspirin, and her head was thumping something fierce.Another five minutes later, the colony received its first message from the object in orbit, confirmation that the massive thing was in fact Marcus Donovans new vessel.Somehow.Donovan requested permission to land a small craft at Ares, and after a heated debate among the senior staff, permission was granted.The situation was too strange not to proceed with caution, though, and even if they were short on weaponry, the colonists decided that a show of strength was in order.Sal and Kazuo were chosen for the task.Thirty minutes after first contact, Sal found herself in the southern mission readiness bay giving her MASPEC a quick inspection, with Kazuo on the opposite side of the room doing the same.Five other maintenance workers were pulling on pressure suits, a collection of aged and dusty rifles waiting beside them.It was a decidedly half assed combat squad.The bulky armor stood in front of her, the hinged panels of its back splayed apart like the petals of a mechanical lily, revealing the padded cavity within.It bridged the gap between suit and vehicle, giving its pilot the strength and durability of a machine, but Sal had never considered using them as weapons.They were an answer to a problem and nothing more  the efficient combination of worker and construction equipment in one tidy package.She keyed in the power up code then grabbed the rails above the docking clamp, lifted her legs up and lowered them inside.Once in up to her waist, she put her arms out in front of her and levered herself into the cavity, allowing her hands to slide all the way through to the ends of the mechanical arms.The MASPEC detected that she was safely inside, and it adjusted its own padding and braces to fit snugly, then closed and sealed the rear hatch.Kazuo was ahead of her for once.Her docking clamp had just released while he was already taking a few warm up steps, the heavily booted feet of his suit making hollow clanks that echoed throughout the bay.She stepped away from the clamp and turned, and the rest of her impromptu squad stood at attention.Everyone sealed up and ready to go?All green, chief.Just waiting on you.Good.Lets cycle the lock, and get ready to roll out the red carpet.With that, they entered the airlock and proceeded to stand around doing nothing while the chamber depressurized.It took even longer than usual, and the wait was excruciating while her imagination ran away with her, inventing all kinds of alien menaces lurking on the other side of the door.She just wanted to get it over with.Then Sal started to have second thoughts.She turned to Kazuo and asked, If this goes wrong, you have any idea how to fight in one of these?She could see Kazuos face clearly in the multicolored glow of his heads up display, and he had an evil smile from ear to ear.He punched his left palm with his right fist, producing a heavy thud, and said, The old fashioned way, Sal.Honestly, Ive been waiting for a chance to bust skulls since the first time I climbed into one.Great, she said, and she wasnt sure if she was being sarcastic or not.Then the outer door opened and they marched into the light of day.The launch facility was a hundred meters from the southern airlock, and amounted to little more than an east west airstrip and a gantry with a decaying multi stage rocket.There were a few steel cargo containers piled up to one side, but there was little else of interest.The facility was all but abandoned.Sal and Kazuo stopped at the edge of the pad, the rest of the team flanking on either side, and they waited.For what, none of them knew, but they hoped for the best.They didnt have to wait long.Heads up, welcome wagon.Subject inbound from the West.Sal scanned the skies and caught sight of a star plummeting out of the western sky.She keyed into a phantom keyboard, and the MASPECs display enhanced the image.Confirmed, base.We have visual contact.The bright spot of light became an oblong vessel, and it came down at an astonishing speed only to suddenly halt over the pad, just as the mothership had done in space.Then, as it hung there in mid air, it came about and gently lowered itself to the tarmac.The greenish vehicle looked like nothing Sal had ever seen before, and if she hadnt just watched it land, she wouldnt even have guessed it was a ship.It was sixty meters from one end to the other, and only marginally aerodynamic, shaped something like the head of a squid.The segmented surface was covered with overlapping scales in some places, while other parts were smooth as pearl, and it stood on five insectoid feet.Mist rose from its every crevice and cavity.I can tell you right now Blade didnt build that.What on Earth is it?Kazuo asked.The phrase wasnt common among long time colonists.Sal had no idea.If I had to guess, Id say its probably never been on Earth at all, she said.And Id believe you.She waved her people forward with a dreamy gesture and they marched on toward the strange ship, rifles at the ready.They moved slowly, apprehensively, at any moment expecting some savage race of aliens to explode from within and eat their faces.Much to their surprise, the attack never came.When they were about six meters from the ship, a rounded structure on the side melted away like a hot tar bubble popped in slow motion.Sharp light came from inside, and when it subsided, Sal could see four people wearing standard white GAF pressure suits.The person at the front of the group gave a friendly wave.Sal waved back.The ship produced a ramp, and the four occupants stepped down it, moving with surprising comfort in Mars low gravity.Newcomers were always uneasy walking on Mars for at least a few weeks, but these were surefooted.Sal didnt know what to make of that.Their leader walked right up to her and looked her suit up and down in amazement.He looked small, but everyone did from inside a MASPEC.He was a black man in his thirties with a strong chin and a good spattering of grey in his hair.An orange device was barely visible through his face mask, attached to the side of his head and similar in style to his ship.It looked like a mechanical spider.The man was smiling.That suit is really something, he said, his warm voice coming in over her crackling headset.What do you call it?Sal blushed.MASPEC.Mechanically Augmented Support Platform, Environment Controlled.Its my own design.Youre very talented, he said.Techs back home have been trying to build powered suits for ages, but they never got this far.Never anything this elegant.They killed plenty of test pilots in the process, too.I know.I was planning to patent the design once I got all the bugs worked out, but well, I guess thats not going to happen now.She pointed to him and furrowed her brow.Youre Marcus Donovan, arent you?As I live and breathe, he said.Now, if youll pardon me, Ive been waiting all my life to say this.I come in peace, Martian.Take me to your leader.One of his men buckled over in laughter, while the other two shook their heads.Right then and there, Sal realized she was in for a strange day, and shed need to find that aspirin soon.Chapter 23:  Becoming Caesar  When Marcus Donovan was a child, he spent countless nights staring through his uncles rusty old telescope at the tiny reddish speck that was Mars, all the while imagining a fantastic world over run with jungles and weird, ancient ruins.It was a world of adventure and unending surprises where dozens of savage species warred for supremacy.Somehow, despite Mars best efforts to the contrary, the fantasy never completely left him.As he grew older, he collected images from all the unmanned probes which had been sent to scout the red planet.The old guard of space explorationvenerable names such as NASA, Roskosmos, JAXA and ISROhad produced thousands of images from orbit and later from the ground.They uniformly described a desolate landscape interrupted only by rocks, but Marcus dreams plodded on unimpeded.When he was thirteen, his parents let him stay up late to watch the first Mars landing live on TV.Six years later during his first year at university, he stayed up for two straight days watching the Ares Colonys daring drop from space.He failed two finals because of it.Even then, with the reality revealed on a constant video feed, he continued to believe that Mars was the most interesting place in the universe.Now he was sitting in a conference room perched on top of the colonys main dome, surrounded on all sides by a three sixty view of the Martian desert, and he couldnt tear his eyes away.It wasnt how hed imagined it all those years ago, but he realized he hadnt been fair to Mars.He hadnt accepted her for what she truly was.The stark emptiness held its own alien beauty, whispering a long story of solitude, while hinting at an exciting future yet to come.Amira Saladinthe woman with the striking eyes whod met them in her powered suitwas the administrators daughter and the colonys chief engineer, and Marcus found her just as intriguing as the planet she called home.Considering her age, hed normally have assumed her rank was the product of nepotism, but hed seen evidence of her talent first hand.The colony relied on technology more than a decade past its prime, but she kept it running and upgraded to the latest spec.She could probably build a radio out of two rocks and a seashell if she had to.Ms.Saladin had given Marcus and his team a quick tour of the facility before bringing them to the meeting room, and when she was finished, he asked her to stay.She looked confused, but with a little coaxing, she obliged.Then they waited.Marcus wouldve hated the wait if not for the view.Faulkland and Juliette were seated to Marcus left, and Rao to his right, while Ms.Saladin was half way around the large table.Marcus thought her choice was a safe one, like taking a seat in the back of a class.Your father must lead a very busy life, Faulkland said to her after a bit.Marcus was looking off toward the eastern horizon, trying to find any hint of Olympus Mons in the distance, without luck.No, he answered for her.Hes the type to make his guests wait.Gives them a chance to reflect on how important he is.Ms.Saladin didnt respond, but her smirk told him he was close to the mark.Thats alright, Marcus added after a moment.Im not sure how many important people we have left.A little reflection couldnt hurt.Another minute passed in silence, and then the administrator came through the door, flanked by a pair blue suited advisers.Administrator Saladin was the absolute image of a statesman, dressed in a fine graphite suit with a red and white sash across his barrel chest, decorated with dozens of medals accumulated during his long career.He was a heavy set man, and had no doubt been exceptionally strong and stout even as a youth.The weight had since become ornamental, but he would probably still place well in an arm wrestling contest.Everyone stood.Marcus took a long stride forward and shook the administrators hand.His grip was firm but not crushing, and he had the same penetrating eyes as his daughter.Administrator Saladin, its an honor to finally meet you, sir.And you, Doctor Donovan.Ive always heard youre a surprising man, but the rumors hardly do you justice.Marcus smiled through his embarrassment.I must apologize for our rude approach to your planet.Were still learning, Mister Administrator.Think nothing of it, Doctor.But in the future, perhaps a little warning would be in order.Absolutely, sir.Warning, and more.With a smile, the Administrator motioned toward the table.Please, have a seat everyone.And perhaps the Doctor will tell us how he came to be in possession of such an astonishing vessel.For the next hour, Marcus told them the whole story from beginning to end.How he discovered Zebra One by accident, and the years of research he conducted in secret, one short glance at a time.The gamble he took in deceiving the Foundation, his teams arrival and initial exploration of the vessel, and how he came to have an alien interface plugged into his brain.Then, as if the rest of the story hadnt been fantastic enough, Marcus told the administrator what he knew of the ships origin, of Eireki history and their desperate fight against the Nefrem.He revealed how the human race itself came to be, and when it was all over, he was badly in need of a glass of cold water.The administrator and his two lieutenants were left in a stunned silence, while his daughter had a look of utter disbelief on her face.It was the look of a little girl whod just been told that unicorns were not only real, but also the source of hamburger meat.This is its quite a lot to take in all at once, Administrator Saladin finally said in his gruff voice.And you believe the invaders to be these Nefrons?Nefrem, sir.And to be honest, neither Legacy nor I know for sure, but until we know one way or another, we should assume so.A very sensible thought.And what of the war you told us to prepare for?The administrator exhaled sharply, with a hint of a growl, and shook his head.I understand you have some kind of warship, but that hardly seems enough.Fill in the missing pieces, Doctor.Youre right.Its not enough, sir.Thats why Im here.Marcus recalled the plans hed sketched out with Legacy, and she echoed them distantly from orbit.He felt her presence there in his head even planet side, but she was faint, and he felt oddly empty without her.Legacy is vastly powerful.Were only just beginning to understand the extent of her abilities.But I neglected to mention that she also houses a factory equipped with technology which far outstrips our own.The skiff that brought us here is just one example of the fleet already under construction, and it was built in just two weeks, if you can believe it.Impressive.So youre going to build your own armada?Much more than that, sir.Your colony is little more than a frontier town right now, and our first step should be to transform it into a fortress.A safe haven for humanity.With your permission, well establish a second factory here and a handful of mining facilities.With our enhanced manufacturing, your habitat can be improved and expanded, giving your population room to grow.Meanwhile, Legacy will build orbital defenses to prevent the kind of attack that devastated Earth.And then?Then we build a proper fleet and liberate our people, sir.The administrator had never stopped shaking his head.This was going to be a tough sell.I have seven thousand men, women and children living on this planet.These people are colonists, Doctor Donovan.Not soldiers.Tell me, what kind of liberation force could that amount to?Ill be the first to admit were facing an uphill battle, sir, but we must fight.It isnt just the planet were talking about.Our analysis of the Copernicus Transmission indicates a sizable number of survivors.Perhaps as many as two billion.Two billion?the administrator said, and he mulled over the decimal places.Its not easy to condemn two billion people to death, is it?Its never easy to condemn anyone to death, but difficult choices must be made sometimes.Im sorry, but if we can help them if theres even a chance, then its our duty to try.Ask your people, Mr.Saladin.Let them decide for themselves.Marcus knew that he was pushing too hard, but every minute wasted amounted to more deaths that could have been prevented.They needed to get to work, the sooner the better.The administrator had his hands on the table with his fingers laced together, and he was staring at them while he chewed on his thoughts.Its true.Something must be done, and if I extend your request to my people, you would have many volunteers.Theyre a courageous and selfless lot.However, Ill not give them the option until Im convinced this is more than a suicide mission.The invaders destroyed our civilization in the blink of an eye, Doctor.What could a few thousand colonists do in the face of such overwhelming power?Simply put, sir, the situation has changed.The invaders caught us with our pants down.They appeared without warning, scrambled communications before anyone could get the word out, and slaughtered billions who never saw it coming.This time, well have surprise and superior technology on our side.The administrator still wasnt convinced.Marcus went on.As long as Copernicus is operational, well have an abundance of intel about enemy troop concentrations and defenses.With a little planning, we can launch surgical strikes that will cripple their infrastructure with minimum risk to our own forces.And what sort of weapons will we use?Eireki weapons?Marcus smiled.The administrator was a very shrewd man.Actually, thats one of the obstacles still ahead of us.Legacy is how best to put this forgetful, and my people, brilliant as they may be, are stargazers and mathematicians.Not weapons designers.Well need to develop our own weaponry, and your chief engineer is the key to that.Me?Amira Saladin asked.Marcus gave her a reassuring nod.If youre willing, Miss Saladin.Ive seen your work, and I wager a single colonist outfitted with your MASPEC armor would be worth a hundred standard infantry.Just imagine what else you could build with our technology.From the look in her eyes, she began to imagine right then and there, and that look alone confirmed Marcus suspicions.She was just the kind of person they needed to make this work.The kind of person Legacy needed.How long would you need to make your plan a reality, Doctor Donovan?One year.An Earth year, that is.The Administrator closed his eyes for a second and pursed his lips.When he opened them again, he spoke.Against my better judgment, you may have your year, Doctor.They shook hands across the table.But Ill be keeping watch on your progress.I reserve the right to pull my people out should you fail to meet my expectations.Understood, sir.I wouldnt have it any other way.One year.It was longer than Marcus could stand, and less than they needed by half, but it would have to do.Chapter 24:  Remedial  The midsummer sun was brutal.Jack Hernandez lay on his stomach, looking down the sights of a matte black assault rifle while sweat ran off him in rivulets.He was wet from head to toe, the sweat making his weapon slippery as a fish.Fifty meters beyond the tip of his barrel sat a target in the shape of a man.A man who was mocking him.
