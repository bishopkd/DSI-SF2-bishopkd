Before the gun could come up, the decadent enemy jaw felt the full impact of a good American fist in all its fury, and that was the end of the ball game.Unconscious, the spy stretched his length upon the deck while Sally retrieved the fallen gun and Jerry rubbed his sore hand, which was already beginning to swell and turn red; it felt as if half the bones were broken.At this moment there was a groan from the cubby, and Chuck appeared, rubbing at his sore neck."Sorry about that," he said, nodding at the great planet swimming in space beyond the window."I was kind of rushed.It looks like I misread the decimal on the knob and gave the machine a tenth of a volt instead of a thousandth. ""A tenth of a volt did that?"Sally gasped, speaking for all of them."What would have happened if you had used one hundred and eleven volts?"There was awe in Chuck's voice that finally broke the silence that enwrapped them."A tenth of a volt to go from Earth to Saturn.We have the universe in our palms. ""Isn't the air getting a little thin in here?"Sally asked, suddenly frightened."Yes," Jerry responded."We are in interstellar space where there is no oxygen; that is why the jets stopped.This plane is reasonably airtight, but I imagine our air is leaking out slowly through the compressors.... ""We're going to die!"Sally screamed and began to tear at her hair."There, there," Chuck said reassuredly."We'll work something out. "He calmed her and wiped away the sudden beading of sweat that had sprung to her forehead and opened her tight clamped fingers and removed the great handfuls of lovely blond hair."We have a problem here," Jerry said, bemusedly."But not one that can't be solved!"Chuck smiled, and his friend smiled in return.They would buckle down and lick this thing."First off let's tie up our spy friend so he doesn't cause any more trouble," Jerry suggested."My arm's a bit sore, so you had better take care of that, Chuck.Take plenty of wire and tie him down to one of the chairs in the cabin.And bring back some of those little bottles of vodka.I think Sally will feel better if we pour a couple of those into her.And I'll put my thinking cap on and find a way out of this. "The air in the cabin was a good deal thinner and cooler by the time Chuck came back.The third miniature bottle of vodka rattled against the wall, and Sally was getting a glazed look about the eyes.Jerry pointed at a glowing sphere that had appeared below the twisting plane, while Saturn rode high above them."If I'm not mistaken that is Titan, Saturn's biggest moon.I have been watching and we seem to be in her gravitational field and dropping down toward her. ""Lesh go home," Sally said suddenly."Press the button on your new erector set and lesh go home. ""It's not that easy, Sally darling," Jerry explained, pressing her hand in his in a reassuring manner."If we activate the cheddite projector now, there is no way of telling where we will end up.Before we throw the switch again, we have to align the resonant frequencies, determine the angle of the solar ecliptic, vibrate the oscillator and.... ""Bullshit," Sally muttered."Press the frigging button and get us the hell out of here. ""There, there," Chuck said tenderly and led her back to the cabin to curl up in the seat across the aisle from the glowering spy, who had regained consciousness and who was now straining against his unyielding bindings and muttering curses in foreign tongues continuously."Here's a thought," Jerry suggested when Chuck had rejoined him at the controls."We know that Titan has an atmosphere and we seem to be dropping that way.Break out the emergency oxygen cylinders, and we'll hold out until we hit the atmosphere.If there is enough oxygen in the atmosphere, we can do a power landing; if not, a dead stick will have to do.Once down we can calibrate and align the cheddite projector on the solid lunar base so when we activate the mechanism again we will certainly end up back on Earth. ""Great," Chuck enthused."I'll get the oxy going back there  wait, there it goes by itself. "As the pressure dropped, the emergency system had been activated and oxygen masks had dropped down in front of all four hundred seats in the great plane.Jerry put on his mask while Chuck dug out a walkaround cylinder and mask and went back to the cabin.Johann tried to bite him when he offered him the mask but relented as his eyeballs began to bulge and then permitted his enemy to fix the mask in place.Sally was asleep, snoring and gasping alternately, and settled down nicely with the mask and a blanket pulled up over her.After that Chuck went through the plane and tied knots in all the dangling plastic oxygen tubes over all the seats to prevent further loss of this precious gas.By the time he had rejoined Jerry he saw that the moon Titan was swelling quickly below them."All okay," Chuck said, dropping into the copilot's seat and pulling at his sore fingers."How does it look ahead?""Not bad.A little lift from the controls, so I think we are at the edge of the atmosphere. ""Doesn't look too darn hospitable," Chuck mused, looking down at the landscape of ice covered mountains, glaciers, snowfields and barren wastes."I don't know. "Jerry smiled."Sort of reminds me of home.So here we go!""If that reminds you of home, I'm beginning to see why you came south.Do you realize that the temperature down there is minus two hundred degrees?""Doesn't sound too bad," Jerry muttered, all his attention on flying the plane."Plenty of lift now, but the motors won't catch. ""Probably because the atmosphere consists of methane, ammonia vapor, nitrogen and inert gases  and no oxygen. ""You took the words right out of my mouth.So dead stick it is.Full flaps, drop the landing gear, and let's have the lights. "Down and down they swooped, hurtling toward the jagged frozen peaks below, a nightmare wilderness of fanged rocks and glaring frozen gas that sparkled in multiple colors as the strong lights penetrated the shadows."If I can clear that ridge," Jerry murmured, "it may be better on the other side. "Fighting the controls with every particle of his strength and skill, he rode the giant 747 like a behemoth charger of the skies, firm in the saddle and strong on the reins.The great ship quivered as the nose came up, about to stall, while the black fangs of rock reached out hungrily for them.Basing the nose down ever so lightly to prevent the stall, they slid over the escarpment with only feet to spare between the ship and certain death."That ice field, there, off to port!"Chuck shouted jubilantly."That's the ball game!"Jerry chortled, and tilted the plane into a sharp turn.Smoothly and easily they drifted down from out of the midnight sky and sped in silence over the smooth ice before dropping to a perfect eighteen point landing.The air brakes popped up, and the wheel brakes took hold, and instants later they quivered to a halt.The first men on Titan!"We're the first men on Titan," Chuck said, "and I think maybe we're going to have to stay here. ""Don't be a wet blanket!AU we have to do is align the cheddite projector like I said, and wham o, we're back on Earth. ""That's right.But we were excited and we sort of forgot that the projector is unreliable in an atmosphere. ""So what's the problem?We take off again and fire away from up on top. ""Take off?""Sure.Rig a feedline from the oxygen tanks to the engines and away we go. ""Hmmm, yes, that should work.But we have another problem. ""Like what?""I've been looking out the window, and that is the third creature with tentacles, a hideous beak, and four bulging eyes that I have seen climb up on the wing. ""Say!"Jerry spun about to see for himself."Do you think there is life on this moon?"Before he could answer, a shrill scream pierced through the air, and on the instant both men were running at breakneck speed back to the cabin.Sally was standing on the back of her seat and pointing with quivering finger at the window, still screaming.They followed her finger and smiled and helped her down, still screaming, and tried to soothe her."There, there," Jerry said, soothingly, "it's just a native of this moon.All the natives have tentacles, hideous beaks, and four bulging eyes. "She screamed louder."It can't get in, so don't worry. "Chuck laughed, and she stopped screaming.Not because of his reassurance, but because her mask had come off while she screamed, and she was unconscious from deficient oxygenation of her blood.They put her gently back in her seat and adjusted the oxygen flow.The cabin was silent except for the scratch, scratch of the Titanians' beaks on the windows."Loosen my bonds," Johann said."They are too tight and are cutting off my circulation. ""You would try to escape then," Chuck said curtly."So you will have to suffer just what a Red Commie spy deserves. ""Schweinhund!""I have a graduate degree in German so I know what you are saying, and it doesn't bother me. "Sally had recovered consciousness and had listened to this exchange and could not bear it."Stop it!"she cried."Here we are, millions of miles from home, four lost Americans, and you carry on like that.Enough!""Silence, woman," Johann said sternly."I am citizen of Democratic Republic of East Germany and a Soviet agent.Not American. ""But you are," she insisted."I know one half of you is East German.But the other half is American!Your father was a good American, and that makes you as good an American as any of us. "Silence filled the great cabin, and they saw a large tear form at the comer of each of the spy's eyes and then course down his cheeks.When he spoke, his voice was hoarse with emotion."Of course.They lied to me.Made me their own.Never told me I was an American.Deprived me of my birthright.When all the time I was as American as apple pie!""Right!"Chuck said, tearing the binding wires free from John's body."You're one of us. ""I can get a passport, pay income tax, vote in the Presidential election, go to baseball games and eat hot dogs!""Darn right!"Jerry shouted as he pumped John's hand.Then Chuck shook his hand, and John turned to kiss Sally but realized maybe he was an American but not that American, so he shook her hand as well."It's great to be part of the team again. "John grinned and knuckled the tears from his cheeks."What can I do to help?""We have a little problem," Jerry explained."We have to take off so the cheddite projector will be able to work, but there is no oxygen in the atmosphere here.So we have to rig a supply of oxygen from the tanks here to the engines.... ""I'm afraid that's out," Chuck said after mumbling some quick equations to himself."I've worked out the amount of oxygen the engines need and how much we have in the tanks and I figure we have just enough to move us one hundred and ten feet.Allowing no time for engine warm up. ""Then that's out. "Chuck grimaced, striking his fist into his open palm."So we'll just have to find another way. ""That seems sort of obvious. "John smiled."Being an American has really stirred up my old brain box, and I'm thinking in a realistic capitalistic way, instead of slavishly socialistic, and believe me, it works wonders!The answer is right outside that window. "They all looked and Sally started screaming again at the sight of the beaks, eyes and tentacles.John went on."While I was sitting there, I had plenty of time to look at those critturs and think about them.What attracted them to this plane?Not just curiosity, they don't seem that type, but something.Not heat, our temperature would be like a blowtorch to them.And I noticed that they are most thick out there around the air compressors. ""Oxygen!"Jerry said, snapping his fingers."Of course.As it leaks out, they suck it up.They like oxygen.Which proves that this planet once had an Earthlike atmosphere, and these creatures are nothing but degenerate descendants of the former inhabitants.They must have a source of oxygen.All we have to do is find it and we can take off.We're going out there. ""The Titanians will attack us for the oxygen in our blood," Chuck said, realistically."Then we'll fight," John said, jaw set firmly."And they'll know they've been in a fracas. "Preparations were quickly made.They sawed through the floor to gain access to the forward cargo hold, where the team's luggage was stored.Since the temperature outside was 200 degrees below zero, they had to bundle up warmly.Each of them put on layer after layer of football clothes and pads and helmets to protect their heads, slinging portable oxygen tanks at their waists.Sally was busy too, using needle and thread that she found in her purse to make them all gloves from the cheerleaders' uniforms.Chuck wore his own uniform with his big number one blazoned front and back.They found number two for Jerry, who, though he could play football of course, did not go out for it since he was too busy captaining the hockey team, as well as captaining the fencing and chess teams.Since John was new to the team and not enrolled in the school, he smilingly settled for ninety nine."We need weapons," Chuck said, taking command of the team."I'll use the ax from the rescue kit. ""Heat is their enemy, so the oxyhydrogen torch is mine," Jerry added."If I use the alcohol from the first aid kit, I can clean all the lubrication from my submachine gun, and it will fire at two hundred degrees below zero," John concluded."Here we go, team," Chuck said."Lock the door behind us, Sally, and only open it if we knock three times. ""Good luck, boys," Sally said, and patted each rugged shoulder as it rushed by her into the fight.The battle was joined.Evidently the smell of hot oxygen drove the Titanians into a frenzy of lust, and they hurled themselves to the attack with a terrible fury.Back to back the Americans faced them and coolly wreaked havoc in their hideous ranks.Tirelessly the great arm of Chuck rose and fell like a butcher's over the block, and tentacles and eye bulging heads flew in all directions, green ichor spurting like rain.Nor was Jerry being sluggard.His torch cut through the advancing ranks of the enemy like a sword of victory, sizzling them into dismembered and cooked fragments.Coolly, John sighted his gun and fired only single shots, yet every single shot went true, right between the second and third eye of a hideous head and into the malformed brain behind it.And still they came.And still they died.To face the enemy the comrades had to climb the mounting pile of dead bodies that grew about them, and so the slaughter went on until the last of the vile attackers met his well deserved fate.Smoke curled from the hot barrel of the gun, ichor dripped from the nowlowered ax, and the oxyhydrogen torch was turned off to save the gas."Well done, men," Chuck said, and they clambered and slipped down the forty foot high mountain of corpses to the ground."Anyone hurt?""A few scratches. "The others laughed."Nothing that counts. ""Then let's go get that oxygen.During the battle I noticed that most of the Titanians were coming from that direction, and if you look closely at that ridge, you will see a kind of white band toward the bottom.I'll bet my bottom dollar that that is frozen oxygen!"They hurried toward the ridge, but before they could reach it, tragedy struck.A shrill scream pierced the thin Titanian atmosphere, and they stopped as one and spun about on their heels.To see a sight so awful that it would be branded in their memories forever.The cabin door stood open, and dropping down from the wing were a dozen of the hideous Titanians.And carried in their midst, wrapped about by slimy tentacles, was the screaming, struggling, lovely form of Sally Goodfellow.5  DEFEAT RUDELY SNATCHED FROM THE JAWS OF VICTORY  Paralysis gripped them, but only momentarily.Before the enemy had slithered another foot with the captive girl, the vengeful Americans were hot on their trail, weapons awave."Chin up, Sally!"Chuck bellowed."Here we come!""I don't think ...she can hear you," Jerry answered between gasping breaths."She has no oxygen tank, so she is already unconscious. "And so she was, her screams were silenced, and she hung limply down the repulsive back of her captor.The fleeing Titanians looked back, easy enough to do since it could be seen now that they had four more eyes in the backs of their heads, and upon spotting the rushing avengers, they took defensive action.Half their number stopped and waited, frigid grasping tentacles raised for the attack.The battle was quickly joined.Heads flew right and left, and sundered tentacles littered the ground like so many salamis, and the Earthmen barely slowed in their rush.But more were waiting for them, and they were dispatched just as neatly.Now the coast was clear, the last of the rear guard dead, and only the fleeing Titanian with the unconscious girl across its shoulders remained.But the holding action had succeeded in gaining this disgusting creature needed time, and just as they were onto the thing, it darted down a gaping trench in the ground.Without a thought, other than to save Sally, the three companions instantly followed it into the unknown.This was raw courage, the spirit that built the frontier and put men on the Moon.Unhesitatingly they went to whatever fate faced them ahead.As it twisted.the trench deepened and then plunged into a black cave mouth.This cave was dimly illuminated by some sort of natural growth on the waIls, apparently a plant or vegetable of some kind that gave off a ghastly greenish glow just as do some forms of plankton in the seas of Earth.There was just enough light ro make out the fleeing figure of the kidnapper, and they went after it at full speed.It darted into a side tunnel before they could catch up with it, and then into another, always just outside their reach as though toying with them, leading them on.Give them credit, they did not consider their own peril for an instant but instead plunged on.They were just upon the fleeing Titanian when it emerged into a larger cave and scuttled slitheringly across its rough floor.After it they went, and they were just about to seize and render it when a burst of illumination flooded down upon them.By reflex they shielded their eyes, and when they could look up, they saw the source of this unexpected light.From floor to rough ceiling high above the great chamber in the rock was covered with the light emitting plants.Ledges ran about the walls, and on the ledges stood numberless Titanians with whips, and upon a given signal they had begun to whip the simple vegetable life.Apparently this abuse stirred the hapless plants to unusual activity, and they burned with cold light, rippling in agony beneath the merciless assault.But the Titanians had no pity, even if they had had the capacity for pity, and lashed on.With their eyes now accustomed to the light the Earthmen saw a sight that made their blood run cold.Against the far wall, on a dais or throne of crudely carved stone, sat a Titanian at least twice as big as all the others, twice as ugly too, outdoing them in loathsomeness.A rough crown of some shining metal sat on its head, and there was a tremendous but crudely cut diamond set into the front of it.But these facts they were scarcely aware of, for what froze their gaze and raised their hearts into the throats was the sight of Sally held in the thing's tentacles while other of its tentacles caressed her ivory limbs revealed through the rents in her thin summer frock that was partially torn away from her fair body.Yet, under this repulsive embrace, Sally was strangely unmoving.In fact her ivory limb was looking a lot more like ivory all the time since, on second glance it could be seen that it was frozen solid."She's frozen solid," Jerry gasped."She was the best," Chuck gulped and took off his helmet and held it before his chest."Don't give up hope yet," John whispered."If we can get her out of this, we can.... ""Eef you attempt too reesist, you vill all die!"the creature on the throne hissed, laying off caressing his prisoner long enough to signal with a tentacle.Instantly all of the entrances to the cave were filled with Titanians carrying long, curved daggers, shaped very much like Arab scimitars except for a lack of a guard of any kind.Bubbling laughter came from the king as he saw their looks of astonishment."You are surprised, no?Beefore thees you faced only my oxygen workers driven mad by your hot oxygen.Now you see my finest troops. ""But  you speak our language?"Jerry said."Naturally.We have crystal detector radios of immense power, and we listen to your radio broadcasts and have learned your tongue.Always we wait for the rockets to land, the first explorers to arrive.Our plans are made.We kill, capture the ship and leave this barren world, where we are trapped with an ever diminishing supply of oxygen.At last we have done this!You will be held prisoner and tortured to tell us everything you know about how to operate your flying ship and then you will die horribly.Seize them!"At this command the minions surged forward and the light plants writhed under increased whipping.But their prey was not that easy to capture!With a single voice the Earthmen shouted 'Geronimo!'and attacked the king in unison.It seized four immense blades from behind its throne, but before it could wield them, a single well placed bullet found its target between its third and fourth eye, and it slumped in death, and Sally slid from its nowloosened embrace."Grab Sally before she hits the ground!"Jerry shouted."She might break!"This was a real danger, frozen solid as she was, and the two men forgot everything to save the woman they loved and leaped and caught her and raised her gently in their arms while John stood behind them, his gun on full automatic, spraying screaming death to the howling hordes.Yet still they came on, daggers raised for vengeance, and John flashed a brief look over his shoulder to see that Sally was safe.As soon as he saw this, he raised his gun and in a burst of bullets shot the whippers from their balconies.Their agonized cries ended in splats upon the floor, and with the whipping stopped, the cavern was once again plunged into stygian gloom."Ich mochte ein Einzelzimmer mit Bad im ersten Stock!"["I spotted a door behind the throne, so grab onto me and we can escape that way. "]Jerry shouted this gutturally in German, knowing that the other two would understand this language, also knowing that the Titanians spoke English and would understand anything spoken in this language.And it worked!He threw Sally, frozen possibly for eternity in a position of stark fear, over one shoulder and felt Chuck seize her ankles and knew, despite the darkness, that John had his hand on Chuck's shoulder.Soundlessly he led them to the door and pushed it open, stepping into the black unknown beyond, fearlessly, preferring that to the certain death awaiting them in the throne room, from which there now emerged a great clashing and screaming."Well done," John whispered."They're killing each other back there, thinking that we are still in their midst.I've closed the door and sealed it  so let's have some light. "Jerry lit the welding torch, and they saw that they were in a roughly hewn tunnel that vanished into the darkness ahead."I'll take Sally now," Chuck said, his deed as good as word, relieving Jerry of his precious frozen burden."Lead on and make tracks because my oxygen is almost gone. "And tracks they did make at a steady ground eating jog of over seven mph, the only sound the thud of their feet and their hoarse breathing eating away at the diminishing oxygen supply.Suddenly, far ahead, they saw a light patch of darkness in which swam distant points of light."The end of the tunnel," Jerry said, switching off the torch."And those look like stars or I'll eat my hat.Be alert because we have no idea what, or what thing, may be waiting out there. "Silently and grimly they advanced, weapons ready, to burst suddenly out upon the icy plain.They were alone, close beside a cliff and not too distant from the 747, which rested solidly, windows glowing a warm welcome."Look," Jerry pointed, drawing their attention to a white band of material in the cliff and to the chunks of the same white substance on the ground."I'll be darned if that's not oxygen  and old kingy had a private tunnel for a constant supply... ""No"  gasp  "oxygen!"John gasped, and they hurried quickly to the plane.With new tanks snapped into place and a fresh supply of the life giving substance filling their lungs, they were ready for anything, and it was Jerry who spoke, detailing a carefully worked out plan."All the Titanians out there are dead  but I'll bet dollars to doughnuts that there will be plenty of live ones along mighty soon.So we had better get ready and get out of here before they put a crimp in our plans  after all, we can't kill all of them. ""Wish we could," John growled, and the others growled instant agreement before Jerry went on."So here is what we do.We dig out the frozen oxygen and fill the forward hold with it, that's the job for you two.While you're doing that, I'll hook up feedpipes from this hold to all the engines and also rig an electric heater in the hold.When the hold is full, we seal it, turn on the heater, the solid oxygen sublimates to a gas, is piped to the engines, we turn on the fuel flow "  " and away we go!"Chuck enthused."Foolproof.But what about Sally?"At his words their happy expressions faded, and they looked at the hapless girl, still frozen in an attitude of horror, who was leaning against the corner of the wall by the bar.It was John who cracked that frozen moment of gloom, clappng his chums upon the shoulder."Don't worry, I told you she would be all right, but no time to explain now.Let's put her in one of the johns with a hunk of frozen oxygen, and she'll keep OK. "They went to work with a will.Working like maniacs, they dug and tore at the seam of oxygen, dragging the frozen chunks back on a sled improvised from a stretcher used by the football team.Nor was Jerry just sitting on his duff, for with the energy and skill of a mechanical genius, which he was, he had replumbed fuel lines and air ducts, rigged an electric heater from torn out galley stoves and generally fixed the great engines to operate in an oxygenfree atmosphere.The hold was almost full, and they were trundling up the last load of oxygen when a shrill and alien wailing could be heard across the frozen plain."Here they come," John said grimly."Load the oxy aboard and I'll hold them off until we're ready to go. "And this stalwart American, so long misled but now returned to his homeland, was as good as his word.He ran forward shouting a battle cry, whether it was "Remember Pearl Harbor!"or "Remember the Maine!"or whatever is not important; what is important is that one man faced that ravening alien horde with a smile upon his lips.Shot after well placed shot rang out, each one bringing down at least three of the screeching, dagger waving Titanians, and the attack was slowed.But their numbers pressed on, and by sheer weight they forced him back, step by reluctant step, until he was almost under the wing of the Pleasantville Eagle."This is my last clip," he shouted back over his shoulder, pulling the trigger on the instant and exploding to green shreds the head of an importune enemy."There!"a welcome voice called out in reply, and three dark cylinders flew over his head."Put a bullet through each of those and get inside.We're ready to go!"And he had just three bullets left.Only a superb marksman could have hit those small targets under the tricky light of Saturn, exhausted and faced by an attacking horde of monsters.But he did it, almost casually, a smile playing about his lips all the time.Three shots rang out, almost as one, and each container burst into coruscating flame.Wails of pain and anger broke out from the Titanians, who were forced back by the only thing they really feared.Heat!Taking advantage of the moment's respite, John dived for the doorway and slammed it shut behind him."Oxygen pressure up to two atmospheres and still rising," Chuck called out, bent over a pressure gauge that had been rigged in the floor leading to the hold below."Then hold onto your hats because here we go!"Jerry called out jubilantly from the pilot's seat as he jammed the throttle home and fired up the outboard starboard engine.They held their breaths, unknowingly, as the engine whined over slowly, protesting at these strange conditions.Over and over it turned while the Titanians pressed close for the attack, whining and grumbling and not catching at all, slower and slower."The batteries are almost dead," Jerry cried."Turn out all the lights, everything that draws electricity, even the monomatic toilets, so I can try again. "Darkness fell instantly inside the plane as the switches were thrown, and they waited in hushed silence as Jerry threw the starting switch again."What were those bombs?"John asked."I didn't know we had any explosive aboard. ""Just something I rigged out of used oxygen cylinders in case you needed some help.Filled with jet fuel and chunks of frozen oxygen.The fuel melted the oxygen, which pressurized the cylinders, which blew up when you shot them, and the inflammable mixture was ignited by your hot bullets. "His words were interrupted by a sudden popping explosion from the engine, and they held their breaths while a cloud of smoke and flame was ejected from the exhaust.The popping slowed, almost stopped, picked up again; then the engine burst into the full throated roar of full power, drowning out forever the screams of the incinerated Titanians who were blown away by the exhaust.His two companions pounded the pilot on the back as the other engines caught one after another until the great ship was vibrating with barely restrained power.Chuck slid into the copilot's seat and readied himself at the controls."I just had a thought," he said as he reached to release the wheel brakes."Did you align the cheddite projector?""I thought you would never ask. "Jerry laughed."It was the first thing I did while the oxygen was warming up.She's now lined up to fourteen decimal points and A OK and ready to go.And I've done all the settings and locked the controls.All we have to do is take this barge up to thirty thousand feet, aim the nose directly at Polaris, also called the North Star, point the starboard wing at the outermost point of Saturn's ring  and press the firing button!We'll appear at twenty eight thousand nine hundred and fifty feet over central Kansas, give or take a few feet. ""Great!So here we go!"The Pleasantville Eagle turned ponderously about and started back down the ice in the very tracks it had made on landing, crushing and incinerating the surviving Titanians as it went.Faster and faster until it was yearning to leap from the ground.Then, throttles full back, it hurled itself into the air, free of the jagged crags below, and pointed its nose towards mighty Saturn."What a moment!"Chuck enthused."Yes," Jerry said, and the smile was suddenly erased from his face."Everything is fine  except for poor Sally. "At these words Chuck's smile went the way of the other's, and only John still smiled across the cabin."I told you not to worry," he said, and instantly four worried eyes, two burning black, two icy blue, were fixed upon him."What do you mean?"Jerry choked out for them both."Here is what we are going to do. "6  LOATHSOME GARNISHEE AND A MINDLESS HUSK  "Before I realized I was an American, you will remember that I was a secret Soviet agent.Some strange things happened then, let me tell you, but that is another story altogether.But I did a lot of training in Siberia, and on one secret mission there I took an advanced degree in brain surgery, which had to do with something else, but while I was working at the underground hospital in Novaya Zemlya, I got to chatting with the other doctors, you know, sort of talking shop, and they showed me some things they were working on.One thing I remember was deep freezing, always a kind of problem in Siberia, as you can imagine, and they had worked out a secret technique for reviving people who were caught out in blizzards and things and were frozen solid just like Sally back there in the john. ""And you know...?"Jerry choked over the words."Sure, I took it all in and could do it standing on my head.All we need is the services of a well equipped hospital with hypothermia equipment and a few odds and ends.Just turn me loose, and in a couple of hours you'll have your Sally again just as good as new. ""Yippee!"Jerry shouted and pulled the plane up in an immense curve toward Saturn."Pleasantville General Hospital and Rest Home here we come!"Upward they climbed and on course, and the altimeter needle slowly unwound.Chuck was at the controls of the cheddite projector and testing the circuits when he called out, "Jerry  we're getting unwanted resonance in the beta kappa circuit. ""Must be instability in the woofer.I'll take care of it. "He waved John toward the pilot's seat."Take over and keep her on course.Align the nose with Polaris, the wingtip with Saturn's rings and sing out when the needle on the sensitive radar altimeter touches thirty thousand feet. ""Roger," John said firmly and took the controls.Higher and higher the great wings of the Pleasantville Eagle soared with John resolutely at the controls, Jerry and Chuck laboring over the vital circuitry of the cheddite projector."Coming up on point zero," John called back."How are you doing there?""In the green  ready whenever you are. ""Okay, watch it now.Ship aligned perfectly, altimeter unwinding.Ready...five ...four...
