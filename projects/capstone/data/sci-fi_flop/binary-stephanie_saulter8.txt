How did he know you were there?If he doesnt have eyes on it?Said he was just passing by, glanced into the alley and noticed us...She caught his look and shrugged.I agree, it feels very convenient.But its also completely plausible.A distance cam?Inside the building itself, high up?Angles are wrong for the mailbox.We checked.Damn.He thought.Was there anything in the chamber?When you opened it?Just a layer of dust.Disturbed, as though something had been there and been removed.Okay...and its just around the corner, hang on, let me work this out...How does a layer of dust get inside a sealed box?On his screen, Sharon was frowning again.Theres a risk in being so certain it leads back to BelNatur that we ignore other possibilities.Or discrepancies.Like, would they really have gone to the trouble of creating an investment trust, sheltered behind a daisy chain of shell companies that appear to take advantage of every corporate secrecy provision on the planet, just so they could pay off Nance?The truth is they wouldnt have needed to set up anything so complicated.But thats how JKE Investments is structured.Thats what its called?JKE?His heart sank.Ari had been right, again.Thats her.Zavcka Klist.Her personally?How do you know?Ive had Klists on the brain today.Ari thought she was involveddont look like that, I had to tell her, you know she wont say anything.Good thing I did, too, because now its all coming together.He explained what he had learned from Aryel.According to the files Dr.Walker found, there was a big blow up about some secret project called Phoenixremember them?and shortly afterward Klist Applied Genomics was merged into BelNatur.The person who now runs BelNatur is a direct descendant of Jarek Klist and therefore probably controls whatever remains of her ancestors legacy.JKE could stand for a lot of things; Jarek Klist Estate is one of them.Thats a hell of a leap, Rhys.Its what I do.I know its all circumstantial, but it fits.Shed have had her eye on Nance for a long time.Sharons voice was distant, her eyes staring off the edge of the screen as she thought it through aloud.Shed have been grooming him, whether he knew it or not.Maybe she snuck the hunt for the Phoenix genetypes into a more general portfolio of industrial espionage.So she found out where the stock was, in half a dozen different gemtechs, and maybe she even had a plan for getting it.Buying it.Such old stuff, theyd have been happy to sell it.But then human gemtech is suspended, the stock is confiscated, the Declaration comes along, and all of a sudden its a much bigger challenge.To which she engineers a solution, using Nance.Even if she didnt instruct him herself, when he got the nod hed have had a pretty good idea who was behind it.Thats what gave him the confidence to go ahead, like you were saying, and its whats making him scared now.Wouldnt she be scared?Thats a lot of exposureboth to Nance and to whoevers her go between.She must have some kind of insurance.I wonder if Nance knows what it is.Maybe you just need to lean on him a bit more.I would so love to do that, but hes been taken ill.By the time I got back from the alley he was being rushed to hospital.Some kind of breathing difficulty, the medic here says it was probably stress induced...Is it serious?Very.Ive just had a message come in while Ive been on with you; hes in intensive care and deteriorating.Bastard goes and dies thatll be another fucking headache.She winced.Sorry.Thats not very professional of me.Of course I hope hell make a full recovery.I wouldnt count on it.The search Rhys had begun running when Sharon said head of security was scrolling up results in a side panel on his tablet.Bruce Dunmore.Hed been there well over a decade, through revolution and regime change, and his rise to head of department paralleled Zavcka Klists ascension to the top post in the company.Not part of the purge Callans been talking about, then.Hes old school.And you dont need vid on the box, you wouldnt want it, nothing that could be scanned for so easily.All youd need is a radio signal, and it hasnt got to travel more than fifty yards or so in a straight line, so it could be weak.Tough to spot in the general stream traffic.Stick a transmitter at the right spot and anything falling through the slot would activate it.Youd coat it in an obsolescence gel thats triggered by the transmission, so if your operative was rumbled and the wrong person opened the box all theyd find is dust.If the drop goes smoothly you just stick a new one in when you make the pickup.Same tech they used to spy on each other, and to get around the government prohibition on tracking runaways.Old school.And then one day you get a signal, and when you rock up theres a bunch of cops wrestling the thing open.So you have a friendly chat with the officer in charge, stroll back to your office, and activate the insurance policy.Breathing difficulty?Thats a nanite bug, the same ones they used during the gem riots in Bangla back in 22, back when Bruce Dunmore was working retrieval for BelNatur in southern Asia.Respiratory paralysis.Nance will be dead inside an hour.And he didnt know.Sharon could never have made him talk if he did.He explained it to her.This Dunmore character is part of it, he has to be.Nance is being eliminated.They know how close you are.Theyre going to be getting rid of all the other evidence toothe genestock, if its still in the building, any remaining traces of KAG, any links to Phoenix.You said Eli had copied some records?They wont be able to wipe his stream.No, I dont think they know about what he found.But he doesnt know anything about this either, and the stuff he mirrored has nothing to do with it, it was just a bunch of old correspondence.Its not important, thats not what He heard his voice rising and stopped.Deep breaths, Rhys.Calm down.She was staring anxiously out of the tablet at him, and he knew he had to explain.Sharon, Ive got a personal stake in this.A big one.Gwen and I are KAG gems, thats why Ari came to tell me what Dr.Walker had found.Wed spent years trying to find out what happened to that company.I know, she told me about that.She said you wanted to know what theyd designed you for, and then you were trying to find your genetype She broke off, and he could see the comprehension wash over her face.I need it.I need it badly, its probably the only chance Ive got.And now I know where to find it.As long as its still there, and as long as they dont wipe everything before we get to them.Oh, Rhys.Can you help me?I can try.Everything youve laid outas you said its all circumstantial, its not ideal for a warrant, but I can argue that the risks are so great they need to make an exception.Let me get on to the hospital, tell them what we suspect is wrong with Nance.If they can confirm that part itd be a big help.How long?Ive got to pull lots of things together and get Masoud on board.Its past noon alreadyprobably tomorrow morning.Tomorrow.At the earliest.Im going to move as fast as I can, Rhys.Look, they know Nance is out of the picture, and they know he cant have implicated them, otherwise wed be banging on their door already.We were at a complete loss in the alley, Dunmore will have seen that.They dont know about you, they dont know how we got on to Nance; theyll assume it was the EGA who spotted the theft, that he screwed up somehow and got caught.They dont know that we know about the hacks, or Phoenix, or KAG.Theyve got no reason to rush.No, but they will Rhys thought.No one who is this careful, this meticulous, this ruthless, is going to leave anything to chance.Not even for a day.Sharon was already pulling back from the screen, eyes darting and urgent, worried despite her own reassurances.He knew there was nothing more he could say, nothing more she could do beyond the task she was already leaping to.The Metropolitan Police would be inside BelNatur within twenty four hours, and it would not be fast enough.He swallowed.Okay, Sharon.Whatever you say.When his earset buzzed Callan thought for a moment it must be Aryel, or Eli calling to offer some explanation for his strange behavior.When he heard Rhyss voice his heart skipped.Hi, sweetie.You okay?Im fine.I was wonderingwhats going on there today?What?Callan was nonplussed.Nothing.Apart from Eli going home to talk to Aryel about something, and Sevi finally working out Herrans wiring.So yeah, I guess theres a bit happening.What do you mean?I just wondered if...if Herran had a minute to check messages...Dr.Walkers on his way back here?Yes, should be with you in the next few minutes.You said you needed Herran?The unease that had begun earlier with an uncharacteristically assertive Herran and flustered Eli deepened and strengthened.What is going on?Yes...I mean, I messaged him a while back, I was hoping hed have one of his breaks...Hes had a couple.Callan looked over at Herran.The little gem had been sitting up for the past ten minutes, feet stuck straight out in front of him and fiery curls tumbling unconstrained by the sensor net as he hunched over his tablet, tapping and swiping and ignoring them all.Now he was being lowered back into position for the next test run, but he turned his head toward Callan.Again he felt a jolt of surprise, as if someone he barely recognized was beginning to look out of Herrans pale eyes.Tell Rhys okay, Herran declared.I send.He tapped the blank screen of his tablet significantly.Send what?Directions.Secret.Rhys knows.Oh well.In that case.Callan pretended an exasperation that was not too far from the truth.Forget I asked.Into his earset, to Rhys, Did you get that?I heard.Callan, I. ..its not that big a secret.I can explain later.Okay?Okay.He paused, wondering again at the gnawing fear that was beginning to growl and rumble around the base of his ribcage; wondering what the connection was between the nervous tension in Rhyss voice and the expression on Herrans face that was almost like a smile.See you later, then.And Rhys?Yes?Love you.I love you too.So much.Binary       25 Zavcka Klist spun on her heel at the last instant before she would have crashed headlong into the wall of her office, and the delicate piece of shimmering glass sculpture mounted on it.Her fury was such that she would have been pleased to break something, even something as expensive as that, but not quite at the cost of her own skin.Instead she paced back, panoramic window on her right side now, the expanse of sky and steel punctuated by smudges of deep, bluish gray.The oppressive heat of the past few days seemed finally ready to summon up a storm.Dunmore had seated himself in one of the chairs on the other side of the mammoth desk, and was watching her impassively.Its all very well to say hes not going to do any more talking, she snapped.The problem is you dont know what hes already told them.If hed told them about me I wouldnt be here to tell you about it.We have time.She spun around again, this time at the midpoint of the great table with the great window behind her blazing too, too much light into the room.The shadow it threw onto the polished surface before her was sharp and small as she grabbed the back of her own chair and leaned over it to glare at him.How much time, Dunmore?Can you tell me that?No maam, I cant.Most likely several days, maybe several weeks.They might never make the connection.Or they might be making it right now.Thats a risk Im not prepared to take.We need to clear out.Get the staff and every last piece of the experiment off site and far away from here.He regarded her with his usual stolidity before nodding agreement.I can get the staff out now, but we cant move anything else during the day without attracting attention.Itll have to be tonight.Late.Ill make the arrangements.She felt a surge of relief, and the rage that had been on the cusp of boiling over into aches and trembling began to subside.Dunmores unflappable demeanor was a strange palliative, she thought; it always seemed to help pull her back from the brink.Not for the first time, she wondered if he had already associated her condition with the enormous costs and risks of their illicit project; and if not, what he thought they were doing it for.You agree we need to move fast, then.Strictly speaking I dont think its necessary to move this fast, but theres no harm in being careful.That Inspector Varsi might not have a clue, but shes no fool either.If she got pointed in the right direction...He shrugged.I could probably slow her down.For a while at any rate, before Masoud got wind of it and took over.He looked momentarily surprised.Oh?By all accounts shes very fond of her husband.I see.Well, shed have to be.He heaved himself to his feet.Id better get on.Is there anything else I should be taking account of, maam?He looked pointedly at her tablet where it sat angled for reading on the desktop, and glanced toward the door through which Khan had been summarily ejected when he came in to make his urgent, private report.Even though their instinctive dislike made them wary of each other, it would have been impossible for someone as sharp as Dunmore to miss the younger mans bubbling excitement.She dropped into her chair and swiped the message from Sevi back onto the screen.No, not really.Its our other experiment of the moment, the neural to digital study.Seems theyve finally worked out how Herrans language centers do the processing.Theyre already modeling a translation matrix that they think will mimic it.She smiled up at him faintly.That ones excellent news, Dunmore.Nothing to concern you.Instead of turning away with his usual barely articulated grunt of acknowledgment, Dunmore looked thoughtful.Glad to hear it, maam.Although Id gotten the impression you werent as interested in that project anymore.Not at all.I just decided to let them get on with it.They didnt need me hovering.The memory of how she had been dismissed by Eli Walker still made her want to grind her teeth, but she stopped herself.If Dunmore picked up any hint that her withdrawal had not been voluntary, there was no excuse or assurance on earth that would prevent him from wondering what could possibly have been important enough to compel her to swallow such an insult.As far as he knew the secret project and the public one were unrelated, and she could not risk him, even him, suspecting otherwise.No one can be allowed to know everything.No one can ever be trusted that far.Once this is over, what do I do about Dunmore?So valuable, so reliable, but the truth is he already knows too much.I wonder if he knows that I can do to him what he did to Nance.I wonder if hes arranged some insurance of his own.No hint of her thoughts showed on her face as she flicked Sevis breakthrough off the screen, as though it was a matter of little moment.She nodded a brisk dismissal to the security chief, channeling full, cool command as she issued instructions.Take every precaution, Dunmore, and any resources you need.As of now this is your only responsibility.Ill expect an update every hour.He gazed back at her, equally imperturbable.Of course, maam.The doctor Sharon had spoken to via tablet met her at the entrance to intensive care, and helped her into an isolation suit.I didnt realize this would be necessary.It probably isnt.I doubt we can save him.But just in case the antivirals we cooked up manage to make any headway against his pathogen loadits enormous, Ive never seen anything like ithes going to be very vulnerable to secondary infection.Sharon turned around.Dr.Ohoruogu had round, kind brown eyes in a round, kind brown face.Both eyes and face looked very worried.So this isnt for my protection, then?Theres no risk of it jumping from him to someone else?No, theres no transmission vector; once its woken up the artificial virus maps to the hosts epigenetic matrix and starts replicating.Itll kill whoever it finds itself in, but it cant infect anyone else.He shrugged helplessly.Trouble is, anything we use to hit the virus also hits his immune system, which makes it harder for him to fight the virus.Or anything else that comes along.Its a race to the bottom.How long does he have?If things continue as they are?Not long.If we hadnt had that call from you, worked out what to give him, hed be dead already.But were not winning, Inspector.Were just slowing things down.Sounds a lot like police work.Sharon kept the thought to herself as the doctor guided her under the sterilization lamp.She stood on the mat, closed her eyes and remained still for the first burst, raised her arms and turned slowly for the second.He repeated the process on himself and ushered her through into the room where Nance lay, barely visible beneath a mass of tubes and sensors.A clip in his nose directed oxygen rich air down into laboring lungs.He did not move and Sharon dropped her voice to a whisper.I thought you said he was conscious?Hes in and out.More out than in, to be honest, but I dont think youre going to have any better chances.She moved over to the side of the bed and looked down at the dying man.His skin had taken on an unhealthy, greyish pallor.He looked half the size of the suspect who had bluffed and prevaricated and sworn at her just a few hours ago.How would he have been infected in the first place?Food?Drink?Possible, but this has moved so fast Im more inclined to think he breathed it in.The nanites couldve been sitting in the bottom of his lungs for years.They arent pathogenic themselves, they just contain the instructions.The body doesnt notice them until theyre activated.And how are they activated?I thought the victim had to be exposed to something else, a trigger?Generally, yes.My guess is he would have breathed that in too.Would explain why the onset was so sudden.The man on the bed shifted.His eyelids twitched, and twitched again, and finally fluttered open, as though with enormous effort.Sharon bent over him, hoping he could see her clearly through the tight bioplastic mask that covered her face.Mr.Nance?Its Inspector Varsi.Can you hear me?A nod that was more a suggestion than a movement.His breathing was so loud Sharon had to speak above it.Mr.Nance, your brothers been informed that youre ill, hes on his way.Do you understand whats happened to you?Again the fractional acknowledgment, and she looked over at Dr.Ohoruogu in surprise.He spread his hands.We havent told him.Heard, Nance whispered.It was a croak, as though just saying the word had cost him several breaths.You heard us talking?A nod.Then you know what your situation is.A dull, dark stare, full of exhausted resentment.She wondered if it was still all aimed at her.Mr.Nance, Im sorry.I truly am.We had no idea, and Im guessing neither did you.She pulled up a chair and sat, leaning forward so that her masked face was only inches from his own.You know whats at stake here.You know who did this to you.I can make sure they dont get away with it, but you need to help me out, Mr.Nance.You need to tell me who you think put these things inside you.He opened his mouth and tried to speak, but all that emerged was a rasping croak.Duh...duuh...duuhhn...The effort dissolved into a fit of coughing and Dr.Ohoruogu moved to the other side of the bed, tilting it up slightly and adjusting the flow of oxygen.His eyes met Sharons and she nodded to acknowledge the message.He cant take too much of this.The spasm eased.Take it easy, Mr.Nance, she said, as soothingly as she could manage.Dont wear yourself out.Now Im going to say a name, and I want you to nod or shake your head to let me know if Ive got it right.Okay?Okay.He was so limp she wondered if he was even still awake, until she caught the glint of eyes peering at her through slitted lids.Dunmore?Is that the name you were trying to tell me?A nod, tiny but unmistakeable.Thank you, Mr.Nance.Thank you very much.She sat back, took a deep breath.As deathbed accusations went it wasnt much, but everything would help when it came to the warrant.Warrant.Paperwork.Station.She leaned forward again.Mr.Nance, I need to ask you something else.About this morning, while you were at the police station.That dull stare again, flat and emotionless, too tired now to be angry.After you and I spoke, but before you were taken ill.Did anyone come to see you?Anyone who wasnt a police officer?He looked away and she thought he was shaking his head No, but his eyes were wandering, vacant and unfocused.His lips moved.Raj, he mumbled.Whos Raj?A friend?A nod.Solic...soli...Raj is a solicitor?A blinked yes.Did he bring you anything?Give you anything?Any medicines, inhalers, anything like that?A shake of the head.Come on, Mr.Nance, think.Someone at the station this morning gave you something that triggered this.Something you would have breathed in, smelled She broke off because his eyes were resting on her again, and this time seeming to see.Cof fee, he managed, and coughed.Raj...And he was out of breath again.She waited through the recovery, thinking, and made a leap.Youve known Raj since the old days, yes?He worked for the company too?He was halfway through another painful nod when the realization hit him.This time the coughing, sputtering spasm was so bad she stood up and moved the chair back to give Dr.Ohoruogu room to work.When he straightened up there was no question of continuing the interview.Nances eyes were closed and he was breathing in harsh, whooping gasps.The doctor lowered a mask over his nose and mouth, increased the oxygen flow again, checked the monitors and shook his head.Im afraid thats all youre going to get from him, Inspector.It might be enough.Im sorry She broke off with a sigh.The brother would arrive just in time to hold his siblings hand at the end, maybe; but any last words he might have heard had been spent instead on her.And she was not sorry.She needed them more than he did.She went back through to the clean room, ripping at the isolation suit in her haste to get out of it, get out of here, get to somewhere where she could work through the implications of this latest twist.An old friend who just happened to be a lawyer.Someone who could find out what hed told the police.Someone he would trust to defend him.What a clever fucker you are, Dunmore.Or do I have Zavcka Klist herself to thank for this?The sound of a throat being gently cleared whipped her around.Dr.Ohoruogu stood there, gazing at her with his warm, worried eyes as he peeled off skinpaint gloves.He pitched them into a recycler festooned with biohazard labels and rubbed his hands together.No, wrung.This kind, conscientious doctor was literally wringing his hands at her.Inspector, can you tell me...is this a gang thing?I mean I know maybe you cant say, but this...this pathogen...were not prepared for this.If this is the start of something...She could almost have laughed.Oh, ordinary criminals!Violence for profit!Vendettas!How I wish.Instead she peeled off her own and chucked them after his.No, doctor, I think its the end of something.I just dont know exactly what.Rhys slipped along the alley Sharon had described to him earlier, noting the metal panel and apparently sealed aperture of the defunct mailbox, his own enhanced awareness checking for and confirming the lack of surveillance.He reached the corner where the passage emptied onto the bustle of the street, slouched casually with his back against the wall that ran between him and the BelNatur building, and pulled out his tablet.It was no different from the pose seen at any hour of day or night all over the city, that of one who had simply paused to check messages or directions; but he had pulled up a reflective surface and was using the tablet as a mirror, scoping the side approach to the round black tower.He located the security cams, calculated angles, observed the patterns of foot and vehicular traffic.The heat was oppressive, and he could feel the pressure building in his eyes and sinuses.Thunder rumbled in the distance, well below the hearing of most.He wrinkled his nose at the prickling that told him rain was on the way.Ill be long gone before it gets here.It took only about five minutes for him to find the combination he needed, moving at the right relative speed to ensure the cover they provided would be complete, and he felt a glimmer of satisfaction.Gwen would no doubt have accused him of being excessively cautious, but no one ever came to grief that way.He did not look up as a group of office workers, hurrying to or from some meeting perhaps, came toward him along the main road.They were bunched up on the narrow pavement, chattering away, and he was confident that most were completely unaware of him swinging without fuss around the corner of the alley as they passed, and falling into step behind them.One young woman, trailing on the outside and to the rear of the group, glanced across with a flicker of interest; he kept his own gaze vacant, unseeing, and her attention shifted away just as quickly.It might not have if the ruby glow of his hair had been evident, but he had reclaimed his hooded pullover and it was as concealed as Gwens had been.He was keeping an eye on a passenger van that was coming toward them, and a delivery truck paralleling their progress on the other side of the street.The one should slow down just there at the intersection, the other speed up right now as the road widened slightly.Here was where the group he had hidden himself in would spread out as the pavement broadened, but here also came the big man he had spotted, hurrying along so that he cut across their path at exactly the point that allowed Rhys to slide up on the inside and peel unnoticed away from the group, the man, the vansthe lenses of the cams perfectly if only momentarily blockedand into the sudden gloom of the BelNatur service entrance.He was moving fast now, because there would be at least one more cam set into the ceiling that he could neither avoid nor risk glancing up to locate.He needed to be no more than a shadow himself, easily missed or dismissed as a trick of tired eyes if the cam was being monitored.A watcher would have seen only a blur, like a bird whizzing through on the wing, gone before it could be brought into focus.He judged the first infrared beam to be about knee height and jumped it without breaking stride; the second was at around the level of his chest and he went through it as he had been instructed.The jump had barely slowed him down but he had to brake sharply for the door, heart in his mouth.Heres where it could all go horribly wrong.He had crossed twenty feet of monitored space in the blink of an eye, but if it took more than that to get inside all his speed and subterfuge would be wasted.The glass panel slid aside, instantly but only partially, just enough to let him slip through.He twisted his hips to clear the narrow opening as it whooshed back and sealed shut again.It would likely not even register on the system as having been opened; like his passage across the entryway it might at best be recorded as a glitch, a gremlin in the system.Thank you, Herran.He had been let into a small lobby, with the drab, utilitarian look of back offices the world over.It was deserted, and he heaved a sigh of relief.Herrans message had given him a narrow window within which he could enter without risk of immediate discovery, but he did not understand how the little gem could have been so certain.Now, though, he saw that the blast doors across the central corridor were closed, and heard muffled swearing beyond them.A flashing light on the control panel to the side of the doors, another above the elevators.Herran had sealed this entrance off from the inside, probably made it look like a fault in the fire safety systems.A minor annoyance, easily corrected and therefore unlikely to arouse suspicion, but guaranteeing a few precious, unobserved minutes.He glided around the side of the bank of elevators, found a door with no lock.The stairwell.He pushed it open gently, crouched low, and slipped through, blurring again into a flattened sideways leap that took him across the landing and halfway down the first flight of stairs.It was a jump that should have sent him pitching headlong to crash, bruised and broken, on the landing below.Instead he touched down with perfect balance, feet spread three stairs apart, and peered cautiously back up at the space he had just crossed.The cam was aimed at head height on the door he had come through.He reviewed the line he had taken, the angle of the jump, and was satisfied that he would not have been seen.But there were voices, clearer than those in the corridor and growing louder, along with the tramp of feet descending from above.He turned, still crouching, and slipped down the stairs.Genetype not in datastream or archive or trash.Herrans message had said, so quickly in response to his question that he wondered if Ari had already asked the little gem, if he had already looked.Not deleted; not there.Somewhere else, maybe.Any idea where?he had asked, as hope faded in him, and he had had to wait for the answer.But when it came it had kicked him out of the apartment and across the city, and down here.Empty under ground.Empty but full.Lots of space, lots of secrets.Too much power for no use.Something to not see.No cams, no streams, no good for me.Maybe you look?The stairway curved down and down, and he followed it into the dark.Binary        Escape It is both easier and harder than she imagined.There has been a distraction in the air of late.Something has them worried, and it is not her.Unease ripples through the underground laboratory; indignation, embarrassment and, yes, she knows the scent of this one well: fear.It hastens their steps as they hurry to and from the elevators and in and out of meeting rooms, prods them into a shuffling half run that looks like panic.Recriminations echo behind closed doors.She has tried to learn what has happened, concerned most of all for how it may impact on her own plans.She senses danger in the way Dr.Panborn looks at her, and then looks away as though pained.There is no more fellow feeling in it than there ever was; it is the customary look of avarice, merely uncoupled now from ownership.Panborn is not the strident, cocksure chieftain that she was.Dr.Owen, who should be gratified by this, is if anything even more anxious.He mutters some bitten off complaint about interference, and explains in small words that they are part of a bigger company and the bigger company has decided to take an interest in their work.Then he adds, But nothing whatever to concern you, Aryel!with a false heartiness that is anything but reassuring.So change is coming, and she has no desire to be there to meet it.She does not for a moment entertain the thought that their unknown overlords might disdain her captivity as much as she does; her secret excursions on the infostream have taught her better.She has learned enough of the world to know that liberation does not lie on that horizon.But the upheaval has won her one advantage: Their preoccupation has made them less vigilant than usual.So she slips from her bed in the early morning darkness of the complex, which she knows mimics at this hour the predawn gloom of a sky she has never seen.A strip of tape salvaged from a garbage can has kept the door unlocked.She makes a brief stop in the closet where the cleaning fluids are kept, then on to the small lab crowded with centrifuges and incubation trays, and the old autoclave that is never used anymore.The lab itself is set aside for blood tests and tissue sampling, the grimy wet work delegated to the most junior researchers.Except no one is junior anymore, there have been no new staff members for years, and everyone thinks themselves too important for so mundane a task.It has become a petty punishment of Panborns to assign it to whoever is out of favor.Even so they have managed to make it only a monthly chore, and the task will not come up again for weeks.She mixes what she has carried from the closet with what she has pilfered over months, carefully hidden behind the panels and in the crevices of machinery.Then she sets the autoclave, time and temperature selected for maximum effect, and pauses by the door, listening for any sound in the corridor outside.All is silent.From where she stands she can look back and see the numbers on the face of the machine, counting down.She whispers a benediction, and slips out.It is the waiting that proves hard.The chemicals cooking behind her need to come to the point of full, explosive potency just when the layers of security between her and the surface are dependent most on people, who can be panicked and tricked, and least on locked doors with the finger  and retscanners that she knows she cannot fool.She can do nothing with the time but fret about the risk of discovery, and ponder the unknown into which she is about to step.But she has picked a good day, it seems: As the hours pass oh so slowly she notes that their agitation is even greater today than it has been.There is a scurry and a bustle and an anxiety that builds as the day goes on, until it borders on hysteria.It is almost as though they know something is going to happen.Its sent, she hears Panborn say to Owen, brusquely but with a note of defeat in her voice, and glances over to find herself being glared at with such fury it gives her an excuse to slink meekly around the corner as though on her way back to the dorm, where she is supposed to stay until she is required to present herself for inspection at the odd hour of five oclock.She has spared no curiosity for this new indignity, whatever it may be.She will not be available.It is early afternoon, and she checks the countdown on her tablet.Five minutes to go.Time to get into position.Back in the utility closet and suddenly paranoid, she wonders why she imagines there is the slightest chance of this working.Surely they know all about it.Surely at any moment the door will be pulled open to reveal guards with stingers drawn.Owen will appear behind them, hands clapping sarcastically, eyes grave and disappointed.Surely, surely, after all these years, after an entire lifetime, it cannot finally be about to end.She pulls the gray blanket she has hidden here earlier up over her head, hugs it tight around her shoulders and nervously twitching, utterly useless wings, and clamps her jaw tight on her own uncertainties.It will end, and end today, because she will not have it otherwise.Her resolve floods back and wraps her even tighter than the blanket: a potent thing, and deadly.The blast is louder than she expected.The shockwave rips along the corridor, sending her staggering into the wall.Something pungent is knocked over and begins to pool along the floor.She peers out, into a corridor filled with smoke, screams, confusion.Trousered legs charge past.She can hear the shouts, people urged to assemble, cries that some are trapped behind the fire.Those will mostly be service staff members, gathering in the old cafeteria further down the corridor as they always do at the end of the lunch break, to spend a few minutes exchanging reports and gossip from up above and down below.Most of the guards, most of the others.They can only get out if they force the fire door that will have sealed them in, and if they do that the rush of air will feed the fire.Either way, they are out of the way.Everyone else will be gathered in the safe room close to the elevators and stairwell, ready to evacuate, or to seal themselves off if the fire prevents it.She wonders if they will notice that she is not among them.She wonders if they will care.She is out of the closet now, and running.Owen sees her through the clear panel on the heavy blast door, and shouts, arm raised in fury.She cannot hear him, not least for the roar of hungry flame behind her, although the backdrafts shockwave slams her forward and into it.She hears shrieks, of pain this time as well as panic.The fools did try to force their way through.She meets Owens eyes through the panel as her hand slams down on the emergency switch.With the fire safety system activated it moves easily, and she hears the hiss as the door seals, and sees his face change as he finally understands.She is already turning away, without a pause or a look back.What she seeks is in front of her.The main entrance, the one that opens onto lobby and elevators and stairs, stands as she has never seen it: wide open and unattended.She is through it like a ghost, and gone.Binary       26 He found her on the roof.She was waiting for him under the arching sprays of the apple trees, just beginning to bend with the weight of swelling fruit.Her seat was one of the many bits and pieces of waste material that the people of the Squats had recycled to new purpose, sparking a wave of retro industrial chic: an old piece of metal ventilation tubing, capped and upended into a stubby cylinder.Normally it served as a stool for stepping up to harvest from the higher branches, or sitting beneath them to rest.Now it formed a plinth for the still life she made, leaning forward with elbows on knees and chin cupped in fists, wingtips skimming the ground as though some great artist of a bygone age had chosen an angels form to personify deep meditation, or perhaps the desolation of grief.She brushed a hand across her face, and for a moment he thought that she was weeping.His footsteps crunched on the gravel path.When she turned to face him her eyes were dry, but her expression told him there was no need to disguise his own upset.He stopped five feet away, full of discovery and remonstration, and found he did not know how to begin.Aryel.She smiled faintly, tiredly, with a sadness that tore at his heart.Eli.Why, he began, then stopped, swallowed, started again.Why didnt you tell me?Do you think this is a conversation I wanted to have any sooner than necessary?Its me.The hurt was welling up in him now.You could have told me.You didnt have to leave me to find...to find...Hands up and over her face again, pushing back her hair.It was loose for once, a heavy dark fall that hung still in the oppressive heat under the trees.I was hoping against hope that you wouldnt find anything else.Calm as always, but instead of calming him in turn he felt his frustration start to rise, and his voice along with it.No.No.I told you it was about Phoenix, and you pretended not to know He stopped.She hadnt, not really.She had done what she always did, changed the subject, misdirected.You knew I knew enough, then, to tell me the truth.And you knew I was going back to look for more.You even said...He remembered what shed said, and trailed off again.She might have hoped otherwise, but she had known that, ultimately, they would end up here.I never thought I would hear the words Phoenix Project again, she said.Her hands were spread now, pleading, trying to explain.I know you think Im never surprised by anything, Eli, but youre wrong.I was...I was shocked that it had surfaced, that there were any records at all, and...and I was sick to think you would learn about what happened there.I knew I couldntshouldntprevent it, but I couldnt bear to be the one to She straightened up on the stool abruptly, shaking her head and her wings back, as though something unpleasant was descending upon her and she wished to be rid of it.Eli stayed quiet, leaning against the espaliered tangle of twigs and leaves, and watched her over folded arms.And what you told me about KAG not knowing about Phoenix, not being in control of it, I didnt know that part.I truly didnt.And its important, really important.It explains so much that I could never work out.What did they have to do with anything?What happened at the lab was before their time.Nothing was before their time, not really, thats what you told me this morning.Jarek Klist set the whole thing up.But thats not what I mean, I meant Rhys and Gwen and...and the others.I couldnt be certain, until now, what it was they were trying to do.Or why they...we...why any of us were possible.But you knew about the research, that they were on to something extraordinary.You must have, you were the proof of it.I thought I understood.I thought I knew exactly what was at stake, I thought I had it all worked out, but I knew nothing.Gods and monsters, Eli, she spat, in a sudden rage that he recognized as self recrimination, if I had known what could happen, if I had understood the consequences, do you really think I would have?My own people, my own But itIWhat did happen, Aryel?He caught the flickering sideways glance that told him she had herself under control and was thinking through her answer, framing a clever response.He found himself moving from disbelief to a slow burning anger of his own.No, you know what, thats what I want to know, and I want to hear it from you.Now.Dont try to divert this, dont you dare.Dont ask me what I read in the memos, or to tell you what I think I know first.You tell me.Tell me what happened.She looked up at him then, more than a little startled, he thought, and full of a kind of quiet despair.And she told him.Afterward he found himself sitting on the ground, his back against one of the long troughs that held the trees of the apple orchard, facing her across dappled shade.Sweat trickled down his back and he felt exhausted, as though he had run a long, long way.She looked just as weary: drawn, and worn, and tiny.Even her wings seemed shorn of their grandeur.The silence stretched out between them, while he tried to digest it all.That was what happened, she had said at the end.And I was responsible for all of it.He knew it as the truth, but perhaps a truth more harshly felt than was necessary.She had been born into captivity, after all, her awareness limited and her sensitivities cauterized; and in the single minded pursuit of her goal to wrest control of her life she had managed to acquire just enough knowledge to be truly dangerous.So you couldnt have known, he said finally.How it was going to turn out, what all the risks were.And at least Rhys and Gwen survived...Yes, they survived.Is that my saving grace, that I accidentally managed not to get everybody killed?He let that one go unchallenged, although the words dropped like acid into the drowsy air.Instinct told him it was best to let their force spin out, dissipate against the lazy buzzing backdrop of bees heedless among the wildflower tubs, rather than try to take her on in this mood.She was being hard on herself, very hard, and for once he could understand why.Do they know?he said finally.Rhys and Gwen.They dont, do they?No.They dont.When they were little it was for theirourprotection.And then they grew up and there seemed no reason to revisit it.She sighed, and tried to shake herself free again.The truth is, I havent had the courage.Itits not how they think of me, any more than its how you thought of me, and I havent She stopped, looked him straight in the eye for a moment, then shrugged, looked away, bit her lip.Can you blame me for that?Not wanting them to know there was ever a different Aryel from the one they grew up with?No, I guess I cant.But I dont think youre being fair to yourself.The Aryel they grew up with is the same Aryel who had the wit and courage and strength to break outjust a bit older and sadder, I reckon.Wiser.And they wouldnt have grown up free and safe and loved if you hadnt.What happened there was a tragedy, and you were one of its victims.I dont feel like a victim.I walked away.I ran away.Thank heavens for that.Or you wouldnt be sitting here now, under an apple tree, in the middle of a city full of gems who are only free and equal citizens because of you.That seemed to bring her closer to tears than any of the horrors she had related, or anything else he had said.She looked down at her lap, muttering, And you.And Jeremy Temple, and Gabriel, and Gaela...we could make a list.The point is, you go through what you go through to get to where you are.I understand that this is a terrible thing to live with, but its not what you intended to happen.That matters, Aryel.And what youve accomplished since thenit makes up for it.It more than makes up for it.I dont know if anything can ever make up for it.A muscle worked along the side of her jaw.I dont think the rest of world would be as...as generous about it as youre being.Im just trying to be fair.And we live in a fairer world than we used to.People might surprise you, if you give them a chance.She shook her head, eyes still fixed on the hands clasped in her lap.She needed something else to focus on, he realized.Some action she could take, something outside herself.What are you going to do about that part?I dont know.She drew a deep breath and finally shot him a crooked smile.Id like to say that it depends on you, but it doesnt entirely.After it was all over KAG came in and swept everything up and Phoenix was never heard of again.Reginald and I always assumed either that KAG was behind Phoenix all along, or that it was a business transactionKAG knew Phoenix had something valuable, so they bought up the datastream and whatever other assets were left from whoever did own it.Either way we thought they were going to build on Phoenixs work, maybe pretend it was all their ownrevive the legacy of Jarek Klist and all thatbut then KAG itself disappeared, for reasons still unknown.She rubbed a weary hand across her brow.Until you found those trashed messages in the archive.I told Rhys this morningI had to, his life might depend on it.I didnt see any other kinds of file, certainly nothing that looked like genetypes, but Im no expert.He must be desperate to get at it.Yes.Things are complicated because the breakthrough hes made in the EGA case potentially implicates BelNatur.So we have to let that play out a little longer, which hes not happy about.I suppose the only upside is it gives me a bit of breathing space before I have to tell them what else is in the files.And my worry thereits not just about me, about what itll do to our relationship.Rhys shouldnt get upset or angry.It exacerbates his illness.And this is going to make him very upset and very angry.I see.He didnt really, but before he could ask what she meant she twitched and reached a hand up to her earset; then hesitated, glancing at him.I have to answer this, its Sharon.She might have some news.He nodded, and she flicked to receive.On another day he would have gestured to ask if she wanted him to step out of earshot, or simply have done so anyway; but not today.He had felt the buffering mass of secrets between them unravel as she spoke, stripped away until it seemed to him that for the first time there were no barriers between them.That emptiness was desolate now, filled with the echoes of her sorrow and regret, but it was lighter too, uncluttered; a clear space in which something new might be built.He had no mind to let it fill up again.She was frowning as she listened.Thats odd.I left him downstairsno, Im up in the garden with Eli.I suppose he might be asleep, although I thought he was too wound up.Whats happened?More from Sharon, and he became aware of a different kind of tension in Aryel: knotted hands and hunched shoulders mirroring clipped, one word questions and a deepening line between her brows.The stillness of intense concentration.Her eyes flicked up and caught his for a moment.They were full of alarm.It was infectious.He found he had shifted into a crouch, and the sweat on his back had gone cold.Hes going to do what?Hang on.Hang on.She was on her feet now, and he came up with her, feeling the ache in his own shoulders as he saw how her wings had gone rigid with stress.Have you both gone crazy?Why?And she listened again, and listened, and finally nodded reluctantly, although her lips were compressed into a white line and there was no hint of relief in her glance.She flicked off at last and met his eyes.We have a serious, serious problem.We need to find Rhys.Rhys had descended four floors below ground level before he found the door he was looking for.The dim stairwell illumination had ceased two stories above, and it was only night vision that let him negotiate the rest of the route safely.There were no cams here, not down in the dark; instead infrareds were cleverly positioned at the midpoint of each flight, requiring further acrobatics on his part.He cleared the last of them with a high, arching backflip, coming lightly to rest on the final landing.Blank walls faced him on three sides.He turned to the fourth and contemplated the door.It was heavy, with no transparent panel to peek through, and rough with the dust and grime of years of disuse.But it had a lock that would have done a bank vault proud: a mostly mechanical contraption with massive cylinders inset into the jamb itself, fronted by an old fashioned alphanumeric keypad.His instinctive calculus told him that the potential combinations ran into millions.And next to the input panel a fingerprint identipad, and above that a retscanner.Security in triplicate.It took him no more than a few moments work with his tablet to confirm that, as Herran had predicted, the lock was completely isolated; no hint of a signal, wired or streamed, extended beyond the devices own impregnable shell.His fingers searched along its edges and found an input slot on the lower rim, no larger than one of Das ancient darning needles.Not a standard memtab port, not at all, but he had come prepared.His fingers worked through the kit of parts tucked away in his pullover and found a matching connector, then danced across the surface of his tablet again, dropping the right apps onto the right memtab.He pulled the memtab loose and attached the connector to it, slid it into the lock, and he was in.Uploading his own biometrics was easy, as easy as it had been on the day they first arrived in London and he had, at Gwens insistence, broken into the Festivals concert hall.With no central server command there were no alarms here to worry about tripping, but neither was there a conduit by which Herran might hack in and sort the third problem, the alphanumeric code.I shouldnt need him for that.But it took a little longer than expected, and he felt himself twitching with anxiety as he watched the combinations spin past.Then the app started to find matches, and as each character was identified and locked into place he realized he was shaking his head in recognition and rueful disbelief.He reached out finally, stilling the spinning icon and tapping in the final entry.Ph03nix2  The lock turned with a soft thunk.He put his shoulder against the door and pushed it open a fraction, listening intently.Faint light showed through the crack, but there was no sound at all; no murmur of voices or hum of equipment, nothing that made his sit sense prickle.He pushed the door wider and slipped silently inside.He was in another lobby that fronted the elevators, its layout not that different from the one just below street level where he had first entered; but he knew from Herran that this floor and the one above it appeared nowhere on the lifts control panel.No reason for any visitorseven the regular staffto suspect its here, and no access unless you have special keys or control codes.But there must be some workers who had been around long enough to know, to remember.He thought about conversations with Callan and Ari, the way the old guard seemed to have been almost entirely replaced, and another piece of the puzzle slid into place.She kept Dunmore, though, and hes old guard through and through.Hell know all about this place.The thought gave him an extra frisson of caution, though the basement seemed deserted.Dim lights brightened as he moved into their ambit.So there is a control system down here.Isolated from the buildings main datastream, self contained.But they kept the emergency door isolated from that too.Which means the system could never be used to lock you out, you could always get in via the stairwell.Interesting.Now if I were a quarantined server running an illicit underground lab, where would I be?He turned slowly, thinking.The elevator shaft ran from where he was standing straight up through the core of the building, creating a spine that supported not only the structure itself, but all its services: the stairwells, wet and dry risers, ventilation and communications.And this was deep underground, too deep for normal streaming.So there would have to have been a satellite hub down here once, boosting the signal from the buildings control center far above.It would have been located close to the main shaft; somewhere optimized to relay a strong signal throughout this subterranean labyrinth.For that reason it would make sense to have located the new hub in the same place.In other words, close by.He found it in a spacious closet off the main corridor, just a few steps away from the door through which he had entered: a small, hi spec unit encased in crystalline bioplastic, hardwired into its power source.No integrated input screen; no one without a tablet of their own could access the thing.Also interesting.So you cant just stroll up and start tapping, and its probably got a preregistered list of the tablets that its allowed to grant access to.Wonder if they still bothered to tell it not to talk to strangers?It did and they had, but the identity safeguards were no harder to crack than the stairwell door had been.And the beauty of a sequestered server is that it cant tell anybody its being breached.The directory read like a smaller, more focused version of the many gemtech datastreams he had hacked: endless iterations of protocols and parameters, reams of experimental data, obscurely titled reports.A messaging platform, unknown to him and heavily encrypted; project and financial management apps that he recognized.Genetype archives and inventories of genestock.KAG, and Phoenix, and others.A glance through those sub directories told him that easily half of them were, or were derived from, the files hed spent the past few days working with.The rest were new to him, but he felt his pulse quicken as his fingers swept the list up his screen.He and Gwen were in here somewhere, he knew it.But there were hundreds of files.It could take hours to find what he was looking for.Priorities, Rhys.His own signal was weak, too unreliable to support transmission to the surface; but strong enough to wake the disused relay circuits, piggyback his tablet, and send a message to Herran.Im in.I found it.Can you help?The response was almost instantaneous.Yes.Show me.He swiped in the permission, thinking wryly that Herran could have bowled over his own defenses, taken control of the signal and looked at whatever he damned well liked within a few seconds.As it was he watched the data zip lightning fast across his screen, morphing subtly as machine code overlaid output; mirroring what Herran was doing on his own tablet a dozen stories up.The message panel popped back to the surface.Plenty lists.Genetypes, genestock.Need time to find yours.They dont just have mine, he tapped back.These are the people who stole the genestock Sharon questioned you about.Theres something very bad going on here, Herran.Someone has already been killed to try and keep it secret.We need to preserve this datastream.We cant risk them getting rid of the evidence.Barely time for a breath before the patterns of data changed again, streaking less swiftly but somehow more purposefully up his tablet screen.Okay.Slow link, take a little time.Do you HAVE time?Then, after a moments thought: Are you secure up there?No one can know what youre doing.We dont know who else is part of it.Okay here.No one know unless tell them.Dont tell Callan, please.Hed just worry.Promise?Promise.Not asking, not telling.You safe.The reassurance made him smile.Herran onstream was a different being: direct, fluidly communicative, completely confident.And more in tune with normal cares and fears than most people would credit.Rhys watched the datastream spin away to whatever safe haven he had devised for it, and breathed a sigh of genuine relief.It would take another ten minutes or so, he calculated, and wondered that there had still been no hint of any other life in this place.Perhaps they had already cleared out, called off whatever experiments were being conducted here, destroyed the evidence?The datastream was incriminating, true, but without the genestock it would have less potency.Sharon would no doubt have told him to leave any further investigation to those qualified to conduct it, but he had already well and truly ignored her orders.He poked his head out of the door and listened to the silent passages beyond, considering.His situational sense was still quiet, but there was a scent in the air that troubled him.It had a hint of the hospital about it, and of something else as wellsomething older and deeper, like the memory of fear, and other emotions he could not name.He hesitated, reluctant to leave his tablet behind.But Herran needed the link, and did not for now need him; so he left it running and went to find the source.Binary       27 Ive been thinking about the excellent progress weve made, Mikal said airily, and it occurs to me we may be lacking in ambition somewhat.Really?Really.BelNatur is so clearly ready.And with the Festivals closing ceremony only a few days away, I believe theres no time to lose.Time for what, Councillor?To end with as big a bang as you began.Zavcka Klist glared at him from the far side of her vast desk.She had consented to this impromptu meeting as much to maintain appearances as out of concern for how close DI Varsis investigation was getting.But, if they had learned anything to link that fool Nance back to the firm, surely the wife would have told her husband to keep his distance?Put an end to all contact, run no risk of a taint to his reputation?Instead here he was, sitting relaxed as a lord in one of her leather armchairs, halfway across the room.She had been greatly surprised to see him there when she turned to take her own seat; she wondered if he had not understood that he was supposed to follow her, and sit where she indicated.Nothing else about the conversation so far was making much sense either.I dont follow.BelNaturs reputation is in a delicate state at the moment, Ms.Klist.Despite our best efforts, he smiled at her gently, things could turn out quite badly, if an impression forms that the company is being less than ethical, or equitable, in the pursuit of its current goals.But it seems to me that all the ingredients are in place for the very opposite conviction to take hold in the public imagination.Caution prickled along her nerves.Youre worried about our reputation?That seems...unlikely.On the contrary.Ive been impressed by your response to the concerns I raised when you made your announcement two weeks ago.Since then our priorities seem to have become more and more aligned.He crossed one impossibly long leg over the other, and spread his bizarre hands for emphasis.Not only do you now have gems working closely with your own staff, youve committed to providing us with reproductive therapy, possibly for a great many years to come.Anything that damages BelNatur has the potential to harm that relationship, and deprive us of its benefits.I am very, very keen to ensure that doesnt happen.I see.A hint finally, of what this was about.And so obvious she could have kicked herself for not understanding sooner.Do you mind me asking, Councillor Varsi, if you have a personal interest in this at all?
