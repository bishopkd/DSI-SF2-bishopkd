Exhausting.We have no allies left, she said slowly.What?He sat down beside her.The mother Titan once had an array of allies throughout the Systems, she said.But her leadership is failing.Now you can trust nobody.Nobody.Your enemies knock on your very door, and I fear they are in the course of letting themselves withinif they havent already.He leaned in closer.Her hands shook, with skin creased in unpleasant folds, covered in dull, aging cloth.Youre sure?You dreamt this?Seldom was she ever wrong in her observations, and he trusted her judgement before any intelligence his Guard could put before him.Hed seen what she could do.Hed witnessed her strength and her many abilities since he was a young boy.For Callista was a great Istron of old: once known as Lucasta; a mysticpowerful and ancient.And extraordinarily crabby to boot.The forces working against you, my little Ruben, are stronger than you, and they are darker and more terrifying.The followers of the High Lord Dishan on Crilshar are everywhere, and they make themselves known only when it suits them.Ruben knew she was right.Fortune of late had been against the general from Titan, for he deemed that upon Rotavar opposing forces had arrived first, offering gifts and dark promises.Liesuntruths delivered through guileful lips speaking of peace and war as though they were material offerings bandied around without a seconds thought.In the past the leaders of the Alignment worlds had been easily fooled and took from the Dishan, believing their futures secure and prosperous, and ultimately giving what was asked of them.Submission.What do you know of the Weapon to Destroy Worlds?he asked her.Nothing, she replied.Never heard of it.Hows the young captain of yours?Who, Mendoza?Yes, her.Have you made the commitment yet?Not this again.Its not going to happen, Callista.You know it cant.You wont be in the Guard forever, Ruben.You need someone too.I have you, dont I?he grinned.She turned away.The astral energies tell me much, but one thing I feel is absolute.A darkness is approaching.However, it is much more frightful than Crilshar alone.Something else is coming, Ruben, and Titans end is near.With those words she fell forward in weariness, as she so often did when recounting what she saw in her dreams.The General caught her and held her close.He rocked her frail figure gently and she closed her eyes, sleeping.Placing her on her bed in the far corner, he turned to leave.Callista at once opened her eyes and cried out.Ruben turned and she feebly took hold of his gold ironed collar.Theres something else!she cried.Its Anna  Shhh, he said, attempting to stop her from going into a panic.Quiet now!You know what will happen if you strain yourself.Theres time for you to tell me.I will come and see you tomorrow.But for now ...rest.She struggled a little as he stroked her warm brow, but eventually drifted off into another uneasy sleep.He knew how hard it was for her; shed told him the struggles of reliving her nightmares over and over, afraid to sleep for fear of dreaming.A hard life indeed.Though he was interested to hear what she could need to say about Anna so badly, he knew it would have to wait; his niece was safe.There was nowhere safer than here.He tiptoed away and left her alone in peace.Her prediction, however, troubled him greatly, mirrored what he saw out there.What he felt inside.He was alone.What in the galaxy could this darkness be?Ten      Guards in training met at Titans Central Institute every day.The past year had been the most intense Anna Berenguer had known, and if it had not been for Callistas help, or the thought of her ultimate goal, she doubted she would have progressed this far.Not ten minutes after leaving the training simulation, Anna had made it to her lesson at the Institute, and though sporting soggy hair and damp clothes, she slipped into the lesson without being noticed.Or so she had hoped.Anna Berenguer!bellowed Christi Guerrero, Vizor of Interstellar Relations, as she sat.Students sniggered throughout the dark, semicircular room.Niece of our famous general or not, I do not want to see you late again, Guerrero said.A good excuse this time, Ill bet.She considered her words quickly.If she thought of something funny to say, they would laugh and he would be forced to yell at them.I was ...washing my hair.As anticipated, the room filled with laughter and Guerreros face burned blood red.Enough!The room went silent.He aimed a look of fury at Anna; though she was sure a trace of amusement at her answer was contained in his expression.As I was saying, he went on, before we were interrupted by our stellar student here, this week we shall return to Crilshar.As weve discovered, discussed, and debated for the past however long, there are many, many ways of identifying the inhabitants of each world in the Four Systems.None more so than residents of the planet Crilshar, other than the obvious dress and accent.Can anybody give me one?No?Very well.Before anyone had attempted to answer he pressed a switch on his belt and projected from the back of the room the image of a Crilshan warrior.Clad in black and equipped to the teeth with blades and arms, it did not look like something you would want to mess with.The Vizor cleared his throat.Take note of the incredibly pale skin, due to the absence of a real sun.Pay attention to the eyes as well: where our scleras are white, theirs are black; where our irises are coloured individually, theirs are always red.This is due to living underground and depending on a rather exotic Surrogate Sun.Vizor, called a student from the front row.Vizor, Titan has a Surrogate Sun too, but we dont suffer the same mutations.Thats true, Angela.But the Crilshan biology is unique, complex, and fascinating too.Can anybody answer Angelas point?Some hands were raised, but only one student held Guerreros interest.Miss Berenguer.A line of reasoning on our dark cousins?Anna looked up from her seat.Shed been listening, but not watching.Err ...theyre in breeders, she said with a roguish grin.The room went deathly silent for some moments before erupting in laughter once again.She received a pat on the back from a couple sat nearby, a few whistles, and an almighty applause.Yes, thank you!Guerrero said.Thank you, very much, Miss Berenguer.But, he said to the group, Anna is correct!A few puzzled looks ensued.I would have phrased it differently, but yes.Would you care to elaborate?Anna wrecked her brain, recalling what her mentor, the irritating Istron, had told her of people on Crilshar.Purity!she said, remembering the session.Theyve believed for centuries that their power and strength is down to the purity of their blood.Very good!But, she continued, the obvious health issues involved with objective breeding meant they had to turn to Old Science for help.Genetic manipulation in particular.During the womb, in order to prevent any mutations.But  Yes!Guerrero interrupted.Known on Crilshar as the Pure Gene, it is commonly acknowledged that this genetic manipulation seen alongside the effects of their Surrogate Sun is the reason for the strange mutations seen anyway at the centre of most families there these days.I heard there were other kinds of mutations as well as their eyes and skin, another student added.Yes.The Vizor began to pace.In addition to their enhanced vision in darkness, Im also talking about superior physical strength, increased audio and other sensual capabilities, and sometimesquite often the caseweakness, incapacity, and even death.The former, however, without doubt make a Crilshan one dangerous adversary.Not for a Titanese Guard!shouted one boy from the back of the room.Another round of cheering and applause followed.The Vizor said nothing.When an active member of Titanese Forces reached a certain age they were generally deemed unfit for active service.When that time came they were given one of two choices: to remain in the Forces in a more static position, no longer able to leave Titan, or else to use their experience and knowledge to teach at the Titanese Institute as a Vizoror veteran.Anna had heard Guerrero was quite the force to be reckoned with in his day.When the class had settled they went on to discuss the oldest and most powerful Crilshan family.The Dishan.Anna absolutely hated hearing of their cruelty in battle.The things they did ...It made her think of her uncle: always out there, fighting the Crilshan threat.It also set her to wondering about her father, Dathlan Berenguer: the fate he likely suffered when he went missing in battle with the Dishan, over ten years ago.She acted as though she had numbed to the pain of his loss, but in truth it was still difficult to speak of him.Her uncle Ruben, she knew, felt the same; he never spoke of his brother.There are three, said the Vizor.Three powers in control of the caverns of Crilshar.And all are members of the Dishan.A name, anyone?One girls hand shot up.Avaj, sir!Excellent!And she would be?Sister to the High Lord Dishan, another student said.Guerrero continued, Yes, Avaj Dishan is the younger of the two, but in no way is that a hindrance.She is both resourceful and cunning.Everyone listened intently.Another!he said.He picked a student with his hand raised at the back of the room.Yes, Andres.Sir, said Andres, carefully.Lord Dishans uncle, Wivartha.Yes indeed, and hold your ears because this is where it gets dark.Wise and powerful, Wivartha Dishan is the brother of High Lord Yuxs late father, Yu, and commander of the army of Crilshar.His unrivalled wisdom and intelligence make him a ruthless and strategic opponent, and a worthy High Council member.Hes an asset to High Lord Dishan and he knows it.Now, though Crilshans are sly and furtive creatures, and we do not know much about their goings on save that which we know already, there is one of the Dark Race whom we havent seen, but know all about.We would all recognise the final of the three, but what do you know of him?Annas mentor had told her all about the High Lord of CrilsharYux Dishan.Currently in his early thirties, he was the youngest ruler of the planet ever in its history.Callista said that, if anything, it made him all the more dangerous.She had told her of the dangers hed faced growing up on Crilshar: the power plays, rebellions, and the constant attempts on his life.Thus, his own lifes mission had been to secure his dynasty, and with no children of his own so far there had been rumours that he was unable to have a child.The pain he suffered, Anna had learned, meant he now took pleasure in causing others pain, creating new fangled ways of performing deliberately slow torment and torture on his prisoners.Anybody?No one raised their hand.No one dared.Anna, he said, can you tell us anything about Yux Dishan?She said nothing, choosing not to mention the terrible things she knew of him.It brought back her fathers memory too much.Dathlan Berenguer had died because of him.She shook her head without making eye contact.No?The Vizor frowned.No one?Very well, I want to hear about him tomorrow from each and every one of you.Let that be your task tonight.Discover what you can of him.He glanced down at Anna once more.That is all.Eleven      Constantine Lesper surveyed the planet Rotavar from orbit.His craft lingered at the edge of the blockade, awaiting recognition from the Crilshan fleet commander.Though the fate of the people of this desert colony was not his concern, and despite the fact he would be in and out in a day or two, he could not help but feel a certain amount of pity.Tall, bald, and brash was, in all probability, how his crew would describe him.And more often than not, he was.But the task he had embarked upon to this small desert world was serious enough that he knew to keep his lips together and his mind on the brief.If he found what he had come for, the Cronat would reward him with everything he had ever wanted, and more.Before long the Crilshan command ships signature riposte was received: an intimidating message of alarm.Lesper kept his cool and had his pilots respond with a coded cipher.It was accepted, and his ship, the Nyx, passed through the blockade and descended toward the planet surface.The largest city and capital of Rotavar was known as Kondogopas.Due to the overwhelming number of Crilshan warriors that had arrived upon the colony, any resistance had been met with zero sympathy; and so the Nyx put down within a fully subjugated Kondogopas, and Lesper was met by an armed guard.In spite of the high temperature, it was a noticeably frosty assembly.Whatever is it you want, it will have to be quick, said a mid ranking officer gubar as Lesper disembarked his craft.My men and I are short on time.Lesper, although pale, was obviously no Crilshan.He nodded, doing his best to appear compliant and dutiful; it was the only way to get by with these creatures.I understand your irritation, he said.And I know your superior officer sent you to meet me at the last moment.If you would take me to him, Im certain youll be permitted to return to your other duties ...hunting defiant colonists I suppose.You suppose right, he said, smiling toothily.But I wont take you to my general.His base of operations isnt within my jurisdiction.Funny that, Lesper said, raising his arm and pulling up his sleeve to reveal his wrist, because its in mine.The Crilshan contained his reaction.Barely.He breathed in and out three times, before turning.This way.* * *  From the Crilshan base of operations, Lesper glanced up at the Prime Ministerial offices.Located on a hill in the centre of the city, the extensive structure that made up the government quarter could be seen from all sides.My gubar tells me you have the mark, said the Crilshan general from the other side of the room.Lesper turned from the window.But if thats true then I must ask: what are you doing here?Lesper paced the length of the room before answering.Our Cronat is unhappy that such obvious force has been used to subjugate the Rotavarian System, he said, to which the general stood from his seat, tensely.A blockade can be overlooked, but the Alignment cannot ignore genocide.I simply followed orders from above, the general said, wiping sweat from his brow.The Cronat says to invade, and I am given a strategy for assault.If you are questioning  Oh no, not questioning.Good, because you have neither the authority nor the skill to scrutinize an army which bears the flag of the Dishan!Lesper smiled.Ill be sure to pass that opinion on the next time I speak with our Cronat.Though I imagine ...Imagine what?I imagine youll be found in greater favour were you to allow me some discretion in another matter.The general swore in his own tongue.What do you want, Lesper?Access into the Prime Ministerial offices.Edgar Mokrikovs office specifically.He needed access to the office to remove an item his Lord Cronat had asked for.The task was not to be revealed to anyone, and Lesper swore it would be done.His cunning always prevailed.Impossible, the general said, however.The entire quarter is off limits.Lesper scoffed.At your orders.And it will remain so.I am following instructions from above.Orders from above, he said, beginning to lose his cool.Always orders from above!Youre a general, for hells sake.Youre not the only one following orders.The general walked toward the entrance, but turned at the last moment.Sweat still plastered his colourless skin.Commander Lesper, you are not a prisoner here, and you may leave when you wish.But you will remain in the outer sectors until you do.Understand?I understand, Lesper said, bunching his hands into fists behind his back.Good.The Crilshan left him alone, and he turned to look back out at the hilltop offices.Oh yes.Lesper understood.Time for plan B.        Twelve      A knock struck the bedsit door.Callista peered out with a single eye.She knew it was Anna, but remained lay on her bed facing up at the ceiling.Anna knocked again, and then let herself in.Callista let out a fictitious rattle of a snore, attempting not to laugh as she did.She knew Anna hated waking her; the old woman was, by her own admission, habitually cantankerous.She watched Anna drift around various tables and stacks of books until she reached the far wall.Always that wall, she thought as she continued to watch the girl stare up at a gold plated map of the Four Systems; four rings of ice, cold azure, one for each system: Sol, Proxima, Accentauria, and Accentaurib.And, as usual, Anna leaned in to read the inscription bowed over the chart.Rathir if ar ubilata itrosfir atran stalar abrantik, bitiar lock nepa dv ebwa, tan su son consullit ar imus prezure israr aundata kosmos      Here lies the final rendering of the Four Stellar Systems of Humanity, she recited.For as the tides neap and ebb, so do our lives  In the surging mass that is the cosmos surrounding, Callista finished.Anna jumped.She fell back and cracked her hip on the sharp corner of a small cabinet, knocking a tall, purple candle over a stack of books.She hurriedly stood it back up, burning hot wax scalding her hands  Annas pain increased tenfold and very quickly Callista couldnt breathe.An image flashed into her mind: Annas face.Tears.Anger.She snapped herself out of the stupor.Ouch!Anna muttered under her breath, and she wiped her hands on her dark uniform.Im so sorry Callista, Ill But the old woman had risen and bounded across the dorm.She rummaged through the desk for an empty sheet of paper and scribbled down the image shed seen.Anna.Again.Callista?Anna said, following her over to the dismal corner shed thrown herself into.Quiet!Shush!Callista snapped.She had to concentrate before she lost the image.Ill just go then, shall I?Anna walked towards the door, but Callista reached for her wrist and turned her around.Do you quite mind?Like I said, shush girl!She finished her drawing and threw the paper beneath a large encyclopaedia.Been for another swim today?Not getting any better in your training, I see.Your hairs always damp when I see you!Actually this time I ...I chose to fall.How did you know I  You chose to fall?Why on Titan would you choose to fall?Never mind.What were you doing in that corner?She peered over her shoulder and Callista stood quickly, but sat down right away as the blood rushed to her head.Sit, child, she said, and Ill show you.Anna did as she was told and balanced herself on an egg shaped stool beside her.She rubbed her hands together, removing the last little crusts of candle wax.Before I do, Callista said, just one thing.When was the last time you saw your mother?Yesterday.Not today?I thought that was implied in the aforementioned answer.Callista clouted her across the back of the head.Less cheek, she said.The reason she asked, other than owing to upfront curiosity, was due to the fact that Annas mother had for some years now been deceased.Has she done anything different in her recent visits?You make it sound as though shes been somewhere, Anna said.Please answer.Shes with me constantly.I just cant see her most of the time.And no, in my dreams she just watches me.Callista wrote what she said into her note book, which she proceeded to place inside her desk.It tore her heart to admit it, but Anna was not the little girl she had once been.The little girl that would forever be asking questions of the cosmos, never content until Callista had told her everything she knew; always happy but never pleased until her never ending questions were answered to the fullest.She had at all times been honest with her concerning the old womans Istronian heritage.Annas marvel had gone silent, but she knew deep in her heart that it hadnt abated.Callista reached into her drawer and fished out another book.She handed it to her student.Anna opened the leather binding and smelt the natural scent of the aging pages, and then closed her eyes, breathed out slowly, and flicked tenderly through.Callista watched her carefully.Inside were drawings of Titan, the Twelve Cities beauty captured incredibly by Callistas handif she said so herself.Turning the pages she found drawings of other cities from out on other worlds: New Assyria; Enustine; the moons of Bravoral.Then came pictures of people: men, women, and children; space vessels, nebulae, and images of distant moons, planets, and stars.Theyre beautiful, Callista.You drew them?I did.Ive many more like it, but this is the most recent.Its my dream journal.I write in it whenever I wake.And often in the middle of the day, when something comes back or I find myself daydreaming.You dreamt all these things?Vividly!Its one of my echoed talents I have yet to share with you.There was a time when I could recall every dream I ever had, but nowadays my memory fails me.I keep these books to peruse, in what has become a vain attempt to understand.To understand what?Callista leaned across and flicked the page forwards twice.All of the images you see represent a particular dream or vision I have had.Not all of my dreams I can remember the same.Some come to me as merely feelings, thoughts, or colours, and arent always as clear as Id like them to be.She sat back and heaved a long winded sigh.Youre not finished.Go on, towards the end!Anna persisted.As she reached the closing pages they were no longer filled with beautiful sketches or portraits, but instead the pages were black, covered in scratching and panicked scrawling of night black charcoal covering page after page.Callista could tell by the look on the girls face that she didnt want to go on.Anna caught her eye.Carry on, Callista said.Anna pressed through, though what she saw next surprised and shocked her so much she could hardly contain her alarm.Just as Callista had anticipated.Upon the final sheets the same image had been repeated, over and over.An image Callista had seen many times now.The dark orb of black fire.Annas jaw slumped, eyes shot up to meet the old Istrons.What does it mean?she asked, her voice unnaturally high pitched.I was hoping you could tell me, Anna.Her eyes dimmed, squinting, gazing through the girl, scrutinizing each small movement in her reaction to the drawing.Anna was hiding something, but Callista sensed she would receive no confession from her young student today.Im afraid I cant help you, Callista.What is it?The Istron frowned.Darkness, my child.Utter darkness.As to what it means I can only wonder at this moment, but I was hoping you could help me with it.Its a recurring dream and thought Ive been having lately.The image of the black orb presented itself after the vague dreams of complete darknesshence the black pages.I thought at first Id predicted my own death, but alas, it seems not!Im sorry I cant be of more help, Anna said, standing.But I really have to go.A lot of work, you see.Very well!Callista waved her off, breathing heavily as she did when recounting her dreams.Be gone with you!Ill ponder the question alone.Im sorry, she said, leaving swiftly, but not before placing the book down, still open, on the page presenting the dark orb.* * *  Callista remained seated.Anna knew something about the sphere but would not say.Time is all it would take.Of that she had no doubt.She sat for some time, listening and thinking.Eventually the old woman took herself across to one of the many cabinets and rummaged through, revealing another book.Oh, she said, almost tearfully, as she opened the book on a random page and sat up on her bed.Oh, Peter ...She looked down at a drawing she had sketched, which presented a much younger version of herself, standing beside an even younger boy.So, so long ago.You have no idea, she said to Peter as her mind drifted back to their parting.You have no idea how much I miss you.She recalled a song they would sing among the glistening caverns of Europa, and she sang it to herself, slowly and whispered:      How far beneath the moon they weep,  Away from life, from death they sleep,  Until decree, they all break free,  And all shall rise, black from the deep.Though fury fills and rage doth stream,  The few that vow are those who dream,  Of greater song and conquered wrong,  To kneel among red pools that gleam.Standing still amid fervent flames,  The wise man bows, red blaze he tames,  His hands are pale, he knows naught frail,  As wind coils round, his voice proclaims:      How far beneath the moon we lie,  Cut off from life, now ask us why;  Were strong as one, until theyre gone,  With kindly light theyll hear our cry.She stopped, unable to sing another word, her mind drifting back to that day.After their parting from Europa, she had set down upon another of Jupiters moons: the remote body Callisto.Used only by trade groups as a hasty go between, she had managed, after some days alone, to stow aboard a registered vessel; and so she made her way to Titan from there.She left the name Lucasta behind, but chose her new name so as to remember the place she had parted from the most amazing man she would ever meet.That is at least what she had thought, until shed met little Ruben Berenguer ...Looking through the book she wiped the tears from her cheeks.You could move mountains, worlds, entire races with your mind and your words.Ive cut my hair.Exchanged my robes for rags.Ive even changed my name.Ive changed everything about the woman I used to be.And no matter what I do to dull the pain of being here without you, it does not change a thing.Youre out there, somewhere, and Im here waiting.Ive been waiting for fifty years.She closed the book with a snap and took a deep breath.But Ill wait fifty more, Peter Marx, if it means seeing you again.* * *  The day after Ruben Berenguers return to Titan came, and it was filled with rumour and anticipation.What would have appeared to be the entire Twelve Cities descended upon the stone piazza outside Central Tower.Word of the generals announcement had spread fast.Everyone was eager to hear news of the Alignment and the struggle against Crilshar.The Titanese Council, which had long opted for a strategy of candour and transparency, seldom refused to consent; and when it was not deemed contrary to Titans safety, the truth was given to the people.Careful.Watch it!Callista exclaimed to passers by as she hobbled through the crowd.For goodness sake, watch where youre going!No respect!One hundred and twenty two years and nothing ever changes!The old woman followed as thousands of men, women, and children moved through the central streets in one enormous multi coloured crowd.She gave up trying to reach the stage and so stood to one side of the horde, not far from the front of the group.On the large stage, temporarily erected, stood Ruben, beside Maxim Pinzn, along with the majority of the Council and several other military leaders.At the end of the stage sat Anna and Glana.Ruben stood up to the podium and a hush descended.In the name of our mother, Titan, he said, welcome!Before I begin, a few words of our upcoming celebrations.For over a thousand years these cities have stood as a beacon of progress and of light.Our world has forever been a symbol of strength and of mercy.Eight hundred years ago we were recognised for this power.In a matter of weeks we commemorate our triumph.It was then, as Callista smiled proudly at Rubens success and bravery, that she sensed something which sent her lightheaded.Unsteady on her feet, she looked up and perceived a darkness of an indecipherable kind fall over the crowd, and it seemed to her as though night had come too soon.She clutched her small staff and leaned over, fighting to breathe.She had not been touched by a sensation so intense for a very long time.Her eyes skimmed the mass of people stretched out before her, which hadnt noticed the darkness.Various shades swarmed about, and then she saw something, and at once she knew what it was.Her eyes met with those of the Crilshan man who watched her through the crowd.He blinked slowly, dark and red eyes visible, and then turned to walk away.Callista rushed forward on her cane, hobbling through the crowd which did nothing to help the old woman pass.Very quickly she lost sight of the mysterious Crilshan, but she could still see his unwelcome presence like an intense, black cloud.She followed as swiftly as she could.Rubens voice could be heard in the air: ...and trade through Proxima Centauri has been halted until it becomes safe enough for unarmed liners to pass through ...Callista reached a clearing at the border of the group, and there she saw him.The black and red eyed man....a new push to gain access into the First System ...He smirked, and nodded, worryingly calm....leaving only one route to respond ...There and then, the piazza thundered and shook beneath the crowd.People panicked and screamed.She turned back and watched Ruben look up from his podium; she followed his line of sight and saw to her horror a dark pillar of smoke rise into the air across the cities.And she knew at that moment something was terribly wrong.The first city!somebody cried.Somethings happened in the dock!Nobody knew what was happening, little less what to do.The military captains were charging down the road to their vehicles; others were raising their comms, attempting to discover the source of the smoke.Callista spun once again, but the darkness had passed.The Crilshan had gone.Everybody remain calm!Ruben called to the mass of panicked faces.This is Titan.We are stronger than to panic!But both Ruben and Callista knew what it meant.I was right, the old Istron muttered.Theyre already here.Thirteen      Upon the deserted fringes of Kondogopas, capital city of Rotavar, a crimson ship lay in wait.Then it disappeared.Thirty seconds later it reappeared.Three seconds and it was gone.The oscillation occurred, not because the controller wished to submit some furtive code, or even because they failed to control the primitive cloaking device, but because pilot Adra Dimal, stood fuming within the cockpit, was in meltdown.Dimal swore loudly, ignoring the two crewmembers stood watching, and punched the dashboard with all her anger.The Crimson Flux disappeared again.Dimal turned.Do you want to take command of the Flux?she shrieked.No, Raj Timbur, the young man stood before her, mumbled.And you?No, whimpered Noah Nuveenthe second, older man.Well then.We have a problem here.Because Im quite ready to get up from this pilots chair, march on down to my quarters, and shitting well give up!Raj Timbur bowed his head, dead beat.Dark skinned, young, and tall he appeared in direct contrast to the man stood cowering beside him.No, no, Raj said.Stay in the chair, Adra.Yes, agreed Noah, squat and tubby.The chair ...stay ...please.Dimal sat back down.Then tell me, boys, why you wont agree to any decision I make as acting capn of the Flux.Raj shrugged his scrawny shoulders.Because Capn Justus is the Capn.Well done, Noah taunted.And Justus gave Kaara that duty were anything to happen  Well Kaaras not here anymore, is she?!Dimal said, immediately regretting such a tactless comebacktrue as it was.Look, guys.Justus hasnt left his quarters since we escaped Manera over two days past.Who was it that managed to get us onto Rotavar?Who saw to it that we landed with our skin still attached when the Flux is as damaged as she is?She looked at Raj, then a little lower to where Noah recoiled.Huh?You, they said in unison like children receiving a punishment.Good.Then I say we get the supplies we need and get away from here while we still can.But we cant, Noah said.Rotavars surrounded.Youve seen the turrets theyve got out there, shooting down everything that moveswings or no wings.And even if we got past them, Raj continued, theres still the ships in orbit to contend with.Noah nodded.We only made it down here because of the confusion following Manera.If it wasnt for the Veryans we would have left before this all kicked off!Ah yesthe Veryans of Manera.Justus had thought it possible to save them from Maneras destruction in exchange for a fee.Typical Justus.Only, they hadnt saved them.The Lord and Lady Veryan had been lost, their daughter, Aron, had only just made it out.And now Kaara had been taken ...We managed to get down here, Dimal said.So its sound to assume theres a way to get back through.I just want to do it before this ruddy desert gets melted like Manera.Noah wiped a plump hand across his forehead.I have no idea how this place hasnt melted already.Dimal shot him an irritable glare.Im going to go, he mumbled.Let you get some rest.Ill go with you, Raj said quickly, and they both retreated from the cockpit into the mid section of the craft, mumbling what they must have thought were inaudible gripes.Adra twisted in her chair and sighed, gazing out into Rotavars barren wasteland.They were positioned on the outskirts of Kondogopas and had been there for the best part of three days.Manera had been wiped off the map, completely annihilated, but Rotavar had been occupied, the area surrounding the planet quarantined, and no vessel or craft allowed leave or entry.As she sat pondering their next move, Dimal noticed in the corner of her eye a small form enter the cockpit.Aron Veryan approached Dimal and stood behind her chair as though she wished to speak.The acting captain twisted again in her seat.Hows your arm?she asked, referring to the sling Aron had her limb draped in.I hear you hit it pretty hard hanging on out there.Not broken, the rouge haired girl replied, placing herself down in the co pilots chair, feet dangling above the floor.Adra crossed her legs and leaned back.Good to hear.Everyones been welcoming, I hope.Oh, yes, very much.You look worried, Aron.She kept her head down.Its just ...those Crilshan soldiers.Theyre out there ...lots of them.Wont they find us?Eventually yeah, but Im planning on us being long gone by then.For now we have our cloaking device activated.It doesnt make us invisible, just unnoticeable from the distance the Red Eyes are right now.But any closer and they will likely spot us.Us, Aron repeated.How ...How many of you are there?In the Flux?Aye.Well, not counting me and the Capn, theres Rajkumar and Noah: the two ingrates you passed on the way in.Noahs our medic and Raj is engineering.Dont worry.It takes me ages to learn names too.Youll get used to them.Theres Rajs sister Jayashrioh, hi Shree, she said, noticing another woman trudge into the cockpit.Aron almost fell from her chair when she saw Jayashri Timbur walk towards them.Its okay, Dimal told her.Shes fine.This is Aron Veryan, Shree.Say hi.Shree nodded slowly.Easily seven feet tall, and weighing more than Raj and Noah put together, the gargantuan that was Shree made life on board the Flux so much easier.She did all the heavy lifting and was always handy to have in a fight.She and her brother had been part of the crew for some years now.They were familynothing less.Your brothers with Noah, Shree, Dimal said.Okay?Shree nodded silently, stood watching Aron for a few moments, and then did a three point turn, disappearing into another section.Aron breathed out.She doesnt talk?Not once.Aron looked away, and then back to Dimal.So theres only a few of you.And where are you from?Everywhere, she said.Proveria, Mars, and Justus is from Earth.I heard Earth is pretty awful.Dimal shook her head.Oh, its not.Then how come youre here?The girl had a point.The whole crew, however, knew Earth was a sore spot for Justus.Nobody knew why hed left, but it was impossible not to notice that theyd never been near humanitys home in all the years theyd been with him.Sensing she wasnt going to get a response, Aron said, And what about the other girl, the  Girl who saved your life?She nodded.Kaara.Her lip trembled, tears welled up.Brave, gutsy, stupid girl.Like a sister to Justus.Its hit him hard, huh?No harder than losing what you have.Howre you holding up?Ill be fine, Aron said, unconvincingly.What are we going to do now though, Adra?Where do we go?I dont know.But well think of something.We always do.Some would call it a coincidence that we happened upon your distress call back on your home.Id prefer to see it as fate.They both smiled.Dimal was glad she could offer the girl a small comfort, but she had to force her own smile, knowing that Dishan war vessels arriving here so numerous and brutal could only mean a more widespread crisis.The people of Rotavar would no doubt be counting down the days until their home followed next and they too suffered the fate of their sister moon.As they continued to gaze out at the second setting sun and watch the darkness rise on this world held hostage, Dimal pondered their next move.She would have preferred not to have taken the Crimson Fluxs helm to slip through the blockade during the attack, but Justus hadnt been able to forgive himself for what had happened to Kaara and so shut himself away.He hadnt emerged for three days, and everyone, including their temporary guest, understood why.Fourteen      Antal Justus unfastened his black overcoat and lowered himself into a cubicle in a quiet corner of the boisterous bar.Two unsightly looking men watched from nearby.Justus leered at them confidently.They recognised him, no doubt.Most people here did.Hed had enough of sitting inside the Flux.He couldnt handle the guilt which bore down on him inside its close walls.It had only taken an hours gruelling walk through the desert to reach the capital, and it had given him time to think.Before the chance to order arose, a pretty waitress in a sandy brown headscarf placed a bottle on the table in front of him.Being recognised had its rewards.Justus had been to the bar a few years ago, only now it was clear that every last scab on Rotavars freshly hacked wound had descended on the district, doing much like they did on Manera.While ordinary people struggled to find a way off the world, criminals and opportunists could do nothing but take advantage.The worst thing was he knew it might have been him had everything on Manera gone to plan.The thirsting captain took a swig of the drink, raising his chin and exposing the veins in his neck as he forced his body to consent to the ice cold brew.He continued to sit in his corner for some time, watching cruel eyed passers by and every so often knocking back another nip of the large bottle.Beneath the table his knife lay on his lap, his hand rested on the butt of the blaster hed stolen from Dimal.Come on, he thought.Someone pick a fight.Anyone.Just give me an excuse to tear a head off.A scantily clad group of women entered the bar and began dancing among the various tables on the other side of the room; Justus watched them carefully.The tiresomely vigorous music being played was in Rovaa: the principal language of Rotavar and a tongue of which Justus knew very little.The women looked innocent enough, but hed learned the hard way that whatever they wanted they got ...or took ...or killed for.It was one of those times that his looks became useful.Pale beyond comparison and displaying long, unkempt, shoulder length black hair meant most women were revolted by his appearance.For the most part he preferred it that way.Poor excuse for a language, grunted a voice from nearby.Then again, he thought, being recognised also has its drawbacks ...Excuse me?Justus said to a hooded man, sat alone on the next table.Rovaa, the man said with a voice deeper than a Crilshan cavern, referring to the descant currently sounding.A poor copy of its old Russian derivation, dont you think?Unbelievable.It hardly matters.I only speak languages that speak to me.The man laughed and moved his seat closer.Im curious.Languages such as?The Common Tongue, of course.Money, my favourite.And death.Though the latter Id rather not know.He laughed loudly once again, and removed his hood to reveal a hairless head.Justus put him in his early fifties; he was wrapped up tightly in a dark cloak, and as well as lacking anything akin to eyebrows he bore an oddly oversized forehead.You enjoying the drink?he asked.You sent this over?Either youre very stupid, he said, or youve given up caring whether or not someone could lace your drink.Pick one, Justus said.Then piss off.But he didnt.Lesper, he said, holding out his hand.Constantine Lesper.Justus regarded him silently, and didnt move.Listen, old man  Oh, but you dont have to introduce yourself, Captain.Please, let me finish!Captain Antal Justus of the Crimson Flux.Youre notorious around these parts.Youd be royalty among thieves were you not envied and hated alike by these less successful felons.Everyone knows that, Justus said, unimpressed.If thats all you  Born on Earth, recruited to Earth Forces aged sixteen.Father: unknown.Mother: the late Lady Casandra  Okay, stop!he yelled, causing those nearby to stop what they were doing.The dancing women continued preying on drunken idiots.Who is this man?Unfolding his arms he leaned forward, right hand loosely grasping his dagger beneath the table.You have my attention, Lesper.What is it you want?Lesper bore his teeth in a disingenuous smile.My boy, I dont want anything from you.You can put the blade away.I do, however, want to offer you something.And what would that be?Lesper grinned.A life of thrills and threats.Purpose.Meaning.The chance of a thousand lifetimes.* * *  A shadow rolled through the hot and hostile streets of Kondogopas.Swift and silent, it vaulted stone walls and negotiated newly partitioning barriers like they were childrens playground toys.Antal Justus stopped to breathe, lifted the lip of his dark coats hood, and caught sight of the large, elevated buildings at the top of the hill before him.The young captain had journeyed to Rotavar some years ago, prior to meeting and later forming his crew on the Flux.But now he was here for an entirely different reason, under a set of circumstances hed not envisaged in a hundred dreams.Thats if you could describe them as dreams.Nightmares would be a better word to adequately portray his nightly forays.He blocked out the images and focused on the task at hand.The steps of the government quarter were sheer and narrow, and he barely avoided a patrol of three armed Crilshans.With ease he clambered over a spiked, metal partition and set his sights on the high, terraced building ahead.Go to the central government facility, the peculiar old man, Lesper, had told him earlier that night.Make your way to the most heavily guarded section of the prime ministers building, and in his private office youll find what I want.You will obtain the item and bring it to me.Thenand only thenwill we discuss your joining my organisation.Smash!The window of Prime Minister Mokrikovs office broke inward and Justus hopped stealthily within.He gazed around the enormous, high ceilinged room, filled in its entirety with a sinister air of abandon.Dark patches of what he could only guess was blood stained the floor.He gave himself a moment to admire the stunning architecture, which in the dark appeared hauntingly magnificent.Not daring to turn on a light he then headed as instructed for the large, curved metal desk and began sifting through the papers on top.It wont be here, he thought.Not here.Not so exposed.He fought to keep his eyes open as he rummaged around, constantly checking for signs hed been discovered.A thin beam of light crossed beneath the office door, and he wondered whether anyone was outside.Dont move.He froze.Who are you?asked a man with a voice both tight and stern.Noting the drawl in his tone, Justus answered, Youre no Crilshan.The man stepped out of the shadows.Neither are you.Turning, Justus leaned casually against the desk with a grin.Well detected.What do you want?he demanded, aiming an advanced blaster.Obviously a Rotavarian, he wore the emerald coat and armour of the Defence Force.Well that depends  Whoa, wait!he said.I know you.Antal Justus!Once more, well detected.Ha!Youre wanted around these systems for piracy, theft, and hell knows what else!Tried, but never convicted!Justus corrected.I never gave them chance.You steal that weapon from a Crilshan?He nodded.The one lay dead outside.His companions will be with us any moment.Now what do you want, Captain?Did the late Prime Minister have a safe in here by any chance?Justus peered about the room for a hint of both an undisclosed hiding place and a means of escapeas he knew it would surely come to it.`  No, the Rotavarian replied.What are you doing here?Im betting he did.Where is it?I asked first.Justus hummed provokingly.Tick tock, tick tock!Theyre on their way, old boy.He followed the mans eyes as they moved unknowingly to the right hand side of the desk.Very good!He jumped up and sprang to the side the writing table, touching around and eventually prising the surface away to reveal an intricately designed safe box.The Rotavarian edged closer to catch a glimpse of what Justus had exposed.Youll never get in, he said, almost leaning over the Captains shoulder.Wanna bet?Id rather just shoot you.Justus grinned, attempting to remember the numbers Lesper had provided him.Three, seven ...four ...five, orant ...tarau, he recalled in excitement, redanta, thirteen, and actha!The box flew open and Justus head shot back, making crushing contact and breaking the Rotavarians nose.Aggghhh!Blya!Blya!he said, dropping the blaster and clutching his bloody face in agony.Justus lurched in reverse, knocking him onto his back beneath the shattered window; leaning down to pick up the fallen weapon, he turned to face him.Apologies, Justus said, heaving his shoulders, but I need whats in here.He leaned back in and continued to rummage through, lifting items out and throwing them away behind him.Before long he found what Lesper had wanted, and lifted up a silver backed book, the Rotavarian R insignia present upon the cover.Mokrikovs diary!the bloody nosed man gasped.You were wanting this yourself?Justus perceived the all too familiar look of a man yearning for something just out of his grasp.No.Ill take that no to mean a yes.And Ill reply to that yes with a goodbye.Apologies once more  The unexpected clatter of movement outside the room caused them both to lock eyes in sudden panic.The shifting light beneath the door revealed they had in fact been found.Perfect.Though momentarily dismayed, Justus shocked grimace twisted into a grin.Pulling out of his pocket a small disk, he threw it towards the large office doors, and then turned to fling the soldiers blaster out of the broken window.He pulled himself on top of the prime ministers desk, kicking away books and paperweights.As he did, however, a small fragment of paper fell from the silver diary, drifted towards the window.The Rotavarian reached out a hand and caught it.What does it say?Justus asked in a second of panic.The man looked up.The bulky doors of the office fell inward with a flattening thud, and several men entered the room, rifles aimed at Justus, who still stood on the desk.He looked to the ceiling.Or, rather, the pane of glass buried within it.Rotavaraan!he shouted, raising his arms to the Crilshans, or however you pronounce it!He reached for his belt, took out his blaster.It is with deep regret that I must now leave this planet in your impeccable keeping!He looked across at the Rotavarian and smiled once more, then nodded.The Rotavarian understood and threw himself down, hands covering his head.With one hand Justus pointed his blaster at the ceiling, clicked its function shift, and simultaneously brought the other to his belt.Goodbye chaps!The ground shook.All went silent, and smoke filled the room, and a blinding light.The disc device hed thrown became trapped under the door and, upon detonation, threw it back outside, along with several screeching bodies.The subsequent seconds unfolded with what Justus had always termed stubborn luck, and his well aimed wire shot took him from the smoke filled room and out into the open air.There he laughed and whooped, warm wind in his hair, as he began to race across the winding and twisting rooftops of the prime ministerial offices.If it hadnt been for the skylightand Dimals brilliantly borrowed blasterhe doubted hed have made it out of that room alive.He jumped, journal in hand, across a wide passage, avoiding a narrow pitfall, before glancing back.Upon spotting the Rotavarian leap across the roof behind him, his long emerald overcoat flailing in the strong wind, Justus almost fell from the brink.Not tonight!He looked back again to see his determined rival swiftly catching up.Justus took out another disc grenade and threw it behind, but gaped in dismay and frustration as the Rotavarian kicked it aside.The disc flew over the edge and a portion of the building exploded beneath them.The roof crumbled away, tiles sliding beneath his feet  He jumped a wide split in the slate and skidded on his knees and elbows, making sure not to let go of the diary.Finding his feet he looked back a third time to see the nuisance of a man still taking chase.Justus eyes widened, however, when he realised they werent alone.Several Crilshans had now joined the pursuit.Blast!he shouted as a hail of red glowing bullets flew past his ear.He jumped off the roof onto a lower ledge, hoping to avoid the gunfire, but he slipped on arrival and collapsed onto his back, crying, Ouch!Ouch!Ouch!A body landed beside him, and a voice said, Ill take that!Almost simultaneously he felt a sharp kick to his face and the book was prised from his hands.Shit!He reached out and gripped the mans leg, pulling him to the floor.A second kick struck his jaw.The Rotavarian disappeared over the edge.Dazed, Justus jumped up and hurdled over the roof onto a lower ledge after the man, landing on top of him with a thud.Both landed face down on the concrete.The journal fell from the Rotavarians hands.Justus stretched out, but he was too late.It slid down the steep side of the building and became caught in a grate at the verge.Now look what youve done!cried the Rotavarian, picking himself up.What right do you have?!Im a captain!Im a chief!he shot back.Step back then, your highness, Justus said, bowing.Ill get it!I dont think so, the chief yelled, bounding in front of him.The Captain swung a well aimed punch which made contact with the right side of his face.His opponent hadnt been quick enough for that, but for the second he was.Justus leaned forward with another swing and the man ducked, bringing his knee up into his rivals chest with a solid blow.Justus fell winded to the ground.The chief went for the journal, but was forced to turn as a beefy looking Crilshan landed before him.He kicked the dark eyed man in the chest and forced him over the side of the building.Justus wiped the blood from his lip.Realising he had no choice but to return with the diary, he forced himself to block out the pain and focus.As his enemys back was turned, he swung his legs out and tripped the chief, sending him smashing, head first, into the wall with a more than cringe worthy thud.He reached for his belt, removed and fixed a high intensity cable to the exterior window behind him, and rapidly cast several grenades over the rim of the roof.Taking one last look at his fallen foe, who in turn looked up at him from the ground, Justus bounded down the slope and threw himself off the edge.* * *  Chief Aleksey Vasily watched in despair as Antal Justus disappeared over the edge clutching Mokrikovs diary.He leaned over to see the captain freefall the entire length of the building before triggering the ropes safety response.At that moment, from the base of the building, a thunderous explosion resonated throughout the structure and plumes of smoke and flame rose high above the ground.Justus disappeared.Hed got away.There was nothing he could do now.As a torrent of bullets from above burst in his direction, the Chief slammed through the window behind him and disappeared inside.He had not obtained what hed come for, but Aleksey Vasily, Chief of the Rotavarian Defence Force, was alive, free, and ready to fight for his world.There was much he had to do, and making his way down through the building and out into the street below, he ran for hiding.Now the battle would begin.As he raced from the quarter now crumbling, ablaze, and smoking, he ran into the shadows, remembering the small piece of paper that had fallen from the diary.He pulled it out of his boot and smoothed it out to find that it was a letter, and on the outside appeared one word marked in Mokrikovs majestic, looping script ......Berenguer.Fifteen      The wind blew wild and sharp that morning on the outskirts of Kondogopas.Neither the Accentaurian nor the Accentauriban sun had yet surfaced and Justus marched back toward the Flux, heaving his aching back and breathing through nostalgic sighs.The return journey had given him, if anything, too much time to think.He had left the silver diary exactly where hed been told; Lesper would no doubt have it by now.He had already given Justus a time for leaving, but held back the fine point of where theyd be leaving from.He knew Lesper had a crew and a ship of his own, ready to proceed to their destinationwherever that wasbut he still wasnt convinced he could be trusted.Still replaying the nights events over and over, he approached the Flux from behind.The rear port was still unlocked.Hed only gone for a drink, hoping to clear his head, and once again hed somehow wound up breaking into an officials quarters, stealing an object worth nothing to him, and, rather more auspiciously, taking out a few Crilshans along the way.All in all, not a bad night.But it was the offer Lesper had presented which sent his mind in a spin.A chance to leave it all behind: the nightmares, the memory, the risk  And just whereve you been?Adra Dimal asked, hanging from the port as he passed beneath, and dropping behind him.Justus turned.Cant a captain go for a drink when he feels like it?We both know thats not why you took off, she said.Get into a fight, did ya?Kill anyone?He shrugged.No one that didnt deserve it.His co pilot breathed out.And if you were captured, or killed, or worse, brought them back here?You couldve drawn attention and got us all caught!Justus gestured behind him at the dim, desolate horizon.Yeah, but I didnt.Whats up with you?She moved closer, and stroked his rough face.Her hand was soft.Kaara ...her loss ...its hard for us all.But I dont want to see you go to pieces, alright?Youre still our captain.They all think youre an opportunist.A coward.I am.Oh, I know.But theres also courage.A lot more courage than anyone else sees.He took her hand in his.You see.Dimal nodded.I see.Almost as though time itself had chosen that moment, Justus felt a familiar rhythm swell along his arm, and he took a step back, gazing at the small screen on his glove comm.His eyes didnt leave the communication as he double checked the received message.The coordinates of Lespers ship appeared before him.Justus?Dimal said.What is it?Its final, thats what.Justus?Her expression, though drenched in dark and shadow, was utterly bewildered.Im not staying with you, he said.Theres something I have ...What?He took a deep breath.I ...Ive been given the chance for a fresh start.Away from this life, from these memories ...this hell.He gazed into her eyes.Youre captain now.He went to move, but Dimal held out her arm.Hed expected a thump, a slapanything but sympathy.I know how hard Kaaras death was for you, she said.But it wasnt your fault.Yes it was!he said, pushing past her but spinning back.And so were the ones before, and all those thatll come, if I stay.Its time I stopped acting the fool, time I stopped putting all your lives at risk  Youre doing that by walking away!Youre free of me.I dont want to be free of you.Its always someone else that finishes up taking the fall, he said.Its never me.Youre just going to leave us here?Her face flushed scarlet, her lip quivering.You coward!You cant just run away!I can go wherever I want, he said calmly.Hed made up his mind; there was no way he could stay.Nothing you can say will change this, Adra.Tears welled up behind her eyes.She fought them.Taking one last look at him, she turned and stormed back inside the Crimson Flux, smashing her fist into the glass divider within.Silence.Thunder soon broke among emerging black clouds.He looked at his glove and said, Our destination?At once his words appeared on the glove screen before him.The message was sent.He took out the blaster hed taken from her, threw it inside, and turned to walk away.Shes right, you know.He turned and glared at Noah, his medic, stood still and hooded in the shadow of the ship.How much did you hear, Noah?Shes right, Captain.In my books saving a life is just about the greatest act one may ever do.Theres a girl in there who is alive because of you.Yeah, and one less too.We cant change the past, Noah said.But your sadness will pass in time.What would you know about my sadness?What happened to Kaara was not your fault.What happened to the Veryans was not your fault.Yes ...it was.But its not just that.I wish ...I wish to the Gods I could have done more.His vision blurred.You didnt see their faces.Thousands died on Manera.So many that I could have saved!But I didnt.I ran past women and children, screaming and crying for somebody to help them, for anyone to do something.But I just ran, like I always do.Its all Im good at.They died because of me.The Veryans died because of me.Kaara died because of me.Noah took off his hood and stepped forward, his belly bursting through the middle of the cloak.There is always something more we can do.But what has passed nobody can change.All anyone can do is promise to do better, next time.Justus looked away.There wont be a next time for me.Whys that?Im done.Ive tried to save lives, but I only finish up losing them.What kind of superhuman do you imagine yourself to be, Captain?Justus held his gaze for what seemed like forever, fighting to summon the strength to say the words.He bunched his hands into fists.Its time I found another path.Look after Adra.Say goodbye to Raj and Shree for me.But Antal ...Goodbye, Noah.And Justus walked away, with thunder rumbling and lightning striking the desert soil in blinding, solemn flashes.No rain fell, but the wind caught his black cloak in powerful gusts.Darkness endured and the man, no longer captain of the Crimson Flux, looked at his shuddering wrist at the reply from Commander Lesper:  DESTINATION: THE WEAPON TO DESTROY WORLDS       Sixteen      A sonorous drone shook the still air, disturbing the silence normally found high above the transcending towers of Titan.Anna Berenguer watched three hovercraft move across the domed sky, far off in the outlying sectors of the city.She did not mind a change from the quiet she routinely found up on her seventieth storey terrace.She had become used to the quiet and deep thought, especially in recent weeks.A hush seemed suddenly to have consumed Titan; the successful attack on the docking city two weeks ago had unsettled everybody.Alongside her building soared the great Central Tower, tallest edifice in all twelve domes, while all about her stood the affluent boroughhome to many great structures which housed the privileged lords and ladies of the city.Pillar like towers stood before and around her like immense metallic trees in undying woodland.Sitting on the edge of the upper tier she allowed one of her legs to hang over the brink, while upon the other she rested her head and embraced with her arms.She heaved a sigh of calm, closed her swollen eyes.She had been so tired lately.No longer able to see her mother in her dreams, her nights had become darker, the nightmares more vivid, foul, and worryingly frequent.It seemed there was no escape.A powerful wind tore straight for her, causing her to shut her eyes and back away, her long hair blowing out behind.The several military vehicles approached quickly and hovered nearby.Thunderous, large, and formidable, they circled the towers in immense formations typical of confident pilots of the Titanese Guard.One day that would be her, Anna knewwere she ever to graduate the Institute.Out of the corner of her eye she noticed a tall figure move behind and sit cross legged beside her.She did not need to look to know who it was.Dont move, said Jon Deloueste indignantly.I have three questions.Question one: does the young lady mind explaining why shes sitting on her own up here while preparations for Titans eight hundredth year celebrations are going on without her?Anna continued to look out at the view.Does the young man mind telling the young lady why he wasted a trip up here to ask a question to which he already knows the answer?The young lady makes a good point, Jon said.Question two: why must she be such a know it all?Because the young man acts like such a dim wit, the young lady must point out the obvious so as not to confuse him.Very funny, he said, and edged along closer.Anna turned to him.He held her gaze.She stared back silently, but he broke into a smile first and playfully thumped her on the shoulder.She hit him back a little harder and they both turned to look out at the view.The hovercraft disappeared behind more distant towers and the silence returned.Question three: have I done something wrong?Anna did not reply, lost in her thoughts.Its still as beautiful now as when you brought me up here when we were children, he said.Yes I remember, she sniggered.You were sick.Dont remind me.Yet, I feel as though its wasted on me now.Its beautiful yes, but the magnificence fades a little after youve gazed upon it every single day for eighteen years.Then why is it you spend more time up here than anywhere else?I feel calm here, she said, watching Jon sigh; the way he always did when she spoke in that way.Titan, the Twelve Cities, this place, its  Like a cage, he finished.He looked away as Anna stared him down.Hows your uncle coping?Anna shook her head.Hes not been the same since the attack at the dock.Hes under a lot of pressure at the moment.He feels responsible for what happened.After all, the explosives were within his craft.It doesnt sound good, does it?She looked at him and bit her lip.Something doesnt feel right, Jon.He was always good at hiding things, just not from me.I can always tell when hes being less than honest.He and Callista wont tell me whats going on.They dont trust me.Im sure they do.He smiled softly.What about your nightmares?Are they still as bad as they were?I havent had one for days, she lied.Well that can only be good, cant it?Yes, I suppose.Have you thought any more about telling Callista of them?Do you really think its the Crilshans who are responsible for the explosion?she asked.Jon frowned at her obvious attempt to change the subject.Who else?I dont know.The General told me that Titan has a lot of enemies, resentful of our power ...or else supporters of the Dishan.They have a lot of support in Proxima right now.Look whos been listening in Interstellar Relations for once, Jon teased.The truth was she had not attended the Institute at all the past week.The nightmares of the black orb had gotten worse since witnessing Callistas dream diary.She had been so tired it had been impossible to stay awake.It was almost like the dream was sucking the life right out of her.I dont think anyone else could have done this, Jon said.It has to be Crilshar.What do you expect will happen now?I imagine its only a matter of time until we have Crilshans flooding into the First System.Theyre already in the other three.Word down at the dock is theyre destroying our allied trade ships, and Ill be surprised if the Council doesnt respond to the invasion of Rotavar.Ive been working down at the dock every day since the attack.Its been two weeks and it still isnt operational.Anna said nothing, but moved closer to Jon and rested her head against his shoulder.He put his arm around her and held her tightly.She looked down to see his hand shaking.Do you think theyre using the attack on the dock as an excuse not to help Rotavar?she asked.Its what Crilshar would want ...if I were them, he said.Maybe theyve infiltrated the Council and are planning on usurping Lady Pinzn!They burst into laughter.Id like to see them try and take her on, Anna said.The General says hed rather confront an army of almuits than that old witch!They doubled up in hysterics and cuddled a while longer.Anna gazed at his soft, dark hair and subtle brown eyes.You shouldnt be here with me, she told him.Huh?Youre amazing, and you understand all this way more than anyone else I know.You should have been taken into the Guard long ago.You know that families like mine are what hold Titan together, he said.We do all the tasks no one else will do.The Guard isnt for me.It could be.I dont enjoy working with my father repairing the harbour city, but I just do it.I still ask myself why I didnt even try to join up.But being here ...with you ...Im so glad I didnt.Jon squeezed her hand and she grasped his firmly in return.Jon?What?She paused.You know I ...nothing.He smiled.I know.With that he turned her around, took careful hold of her face with both shaking hands, and looked into her eyes.Run away with me.Anna froze.What?He breathed deeply and repeated, Run away with me, Anna.Ive thought about leaving Titan for goodthought about it for so longand now Im going to do itand I want you to come with me.I can protect you.We can leave Titan behind and have a life together.Somewhere safe.Somewhere else.Please say yes.She thumped him on the shoulder again.Dont be ridiculous!Im not.Youre joking!I wish I was.Anna stood.Leave Titan?I ...I couldnt ...I mean, my family, my sister.We have lives here.We cant just r ...run away.Think about yourself, Annathink about us, he said, standing and following her back towards her room.This place is no longer safe.Look at the armies preparing to march to war right in front of you.A war they wont win.We dont have a future here.Anna couldnt think straight.Here was the man she loved giving her the greatest choice, the most terrible choice.I do have a future on Titan, she said.I turn eighteen the day after tomorrow.Then I can join the Forces, the Titanese Guard, and then help to fight.Do you really think your uncle will let you join the Guard with everything thats happening right now?he cried, following her inside.He will!He said hed allow me to once I turned eighteen.After all this time its now only two days away!Why else would he train me if not to prepare me for the trials of the Four Systems?Jon made no reply.Look, I cant leave.I can count on the General.He wont let me down.I trust him more than anyone.After a brief silence Jon mumbled, I see.Well I hope youre right.But I seriously have to consider leaving.Theres nothing much for me here ...other than you.Ive found a way to disappear.Working amongst all the confusion at the docks its been easy to get hold of flight schedules and spacecraft plans.Well visit places youve always wanted!Anna could not reply.The offers still there, but not for long.Wed have to go soon ...A tear rolled down her cheek....and leave ...for Earth.Seventeen      With all the cares Anna had been carrying of late, she had easily overlooked the many celebrations due to take place that year, most of which were beginning that very week.The Standard Year 4262 marked the eight hundredth year since Titan became an established World, surrendering the given title of colony.It was a big deal by any account, and at the end of the week huge gatherings had been planned all across the Twelve Citiesthe largest of which was to take place at Central Tower.It was useful timing; everybody needed something to cheer them up.It just so happened that that week was also Annas birthday.Two days and everything would change for the better.Having left Jon alone Anna raced across the central city in the direction of the Command Dome.Experiencing a little trouble getting past security, she managed to get them to back down, and off she went in search of her uncle.Jon was wrong.The General would not stop her from joining the Guard.She would prove it right now.She found him stood outside the principal chamber of the Titanese Council, clad in his best silver and black velvet surcoat, chatting happily with another member of the assembly.But as she strode up the Generals expression rolled from cheerful to one of shock.Anna, how did you  Excellent security you have here, she said.You need to give that entrance guard a raise.And perhaps a little more training.But the General wasnt smiling.You cant just wander in here, Anna.I know, but I need to speak to you.Whats wrong?Is it Callista?No.Your sister?No, theyre fine.I just need to talk.Im afraid whatever you want to say, itll have to wait, Anna dear, he said.Im about to go into a meeting.Fidgeting, she said, Is it important?Somewhat.But nothing for you to worry about.Go on, well speak later.But I  Later, Anna.She turned, blushing.The other council members had stopped to watch, so she scurried back around the corner and out of sight.It seemed strange; it looked to her as though the entire council was there.That only happened in times of crisis.As usual her curiosity took hold and, peering back around the wide pillar behind which she had taken cover, she watched her uncle turn and continue his conversation with the elderly Anthea Godnoa good friend of the Berenguers and a devoted champion of their cause.Thickset and almost dwarf like, Anthea still looked beautiful in her old age, and presented her silver hair in twisted locks wrapped elegantly around her shoulders.Anna thought of Jons words: Do you really think your uncle will let you join the Guard with everything thats happening right now?Glancing around her carefully, she crept from behind the pillar and moved to the back of another white column.There stood several in tempered succession, all along the opening to the large council chamber where the nearby assembly was gathered.Anna chose her timing well and tiptoed behind the columns, sliding in through the semi open doors.Inside she found a dark and spacious hall.It was windowless, devoid of all natural light, but the periphery of the chamber was lined with enormous stone statues.Narrow shafts of light burned from each of their bases.Some statues she recognised as past lords and ladies and other famous symbols of Titan.Along the chambers centre stretched two long tables lined with fine chairs; they both faced each other with an opening of four small strides in between.At the end of the two counters, positioned in the centre, was a large lilac coloured chair on a platform which rose slightly higher.Mighty doors groaned open and the shrill echo set Anna bounding towards the edge of the room.She buried herself in the shrubbery scattered between each the sculptures, her heart thumping in her throat.Peering through a leafy gap she watched the lords, ladies, administrators, and captains promptly make their way into the grand room, forming rows of regal poses and humourless expressions.Separated into tables of military and non military men and women, they each took their positions and sat, still chatting among themselves.Anna counted roughly fifty in total, all wearing luxurious robes like her uncle Ruben.From her hiding place she watched her uncle sit at the end of the farthest table, beside the elevated chair, clasping his hands together and eyeing the council members sat directly opposite.The chair to his left was empty, but sat in the next she recognised the disgruntled face of Captain Ernesta Mendoza.A little along she spotted the cheerful countenance of another captain.Fresh faced and naturally tanned, Diego Ferranti sat still, his handsome blond curls drooping down in such a way that every so often they forced him to blow them from in front of his eyes.Anna found herself grinning at his amusing expression whenever it occurred.Before any of them could get comfortable the large doors of the room creaked back open and in strode Lady Maxim Pinzn.The woman had always scared Anna; she had a strange, powerful air about her.Pinzn glided the length of the room in seconds, her own long purple cloak floating behind her as though trying to escape.She never looked in high spirits.Everyone rose to greet her as she drifted between the two tables; though judging by the Ladys face, which glowed almost as purple as her cloak, she could not have cared less had they remained seated.Stopping at her chair as two members of the Guard slammed the chamber door closed, she breathed deeply, before gently sitting, crossing her legs, and joining both hands upon her lap.At once Anna was forced to move as two of the Titanese Guard that had entered with Lady Pinzn made their way towards where she was hidden.Her body filled with the adrenaline of dread, fearing she had been seen, but she managed to slink behind another grand grey statue of a past lord of Titan holding a coiled blade high above his head.She stopped moving and stayed deadly quiet, remaining breathless but fortunately unnoticed.In an attempt, it would seem, to abandon tradition, introductions were overlooked and Lady Pinzn made a start.A dark day is looming, she declared.And with it the time has come for us to decide what is truly important to us and our people.The room remained silent, and then a high pitched voice spoke.What was important to us a century ago is still important to us now, said Anthea Godno, struggling to reach over the table.What was important to us one month ago is still important to us now.My dear colleagues, nothing has changed  Everything has changed!a deep voice boomed from the chamber door, which now stood wide open.Or do you not see what goes on past the end of your nose, Anthea?Now hold on  But of course, the newcomer went on, not everybody can be expected to comprehend the transformations that occur as well as others.Anna felt herself glaring at the newcomer as he paced down the room, clutching a long, dark staff which bounced off his puffed out chest.He reached Ruben Berenguer, who stood and placed a hand upon his breast in salute.General Mauldeth, he said.Berenguer, Mauldeth replied, not reciprocating the courtesy of his counterparts gesture.He lowered himself into the empty seat beside, virtually disregarding his very presence.He took a deep intake of the cigarillo he held between his thumb and forefingers, before putting it out on the table and blowing the smoke in Rubens direction.Her uncle did not respond and faced Mauldeth, composed.There followed an uncomfortable silence before Pinzn turned to Mauldeth and said, Has the chatter died down, General?He held her gaze.If youre referring to the events in our docking city, rumours have taken much longer to die down than expected, though the upmost has been done to distinguish any talk of the appalling incident altogether.As he spoke he glanced at her uncle, raising his eyebrows as though expecting some sort of apology for bringing the weapon into the Twelve Cities.Anna wanted to jump out and defend him, but her uncle simply sat there, silent.And what of repairs to the city?Just about completed, my lady.The auxiliary tunnels have seen fit to allow small crafts and crews through, in part, but large military vehicles and equipment may soon be deployed.Interstellar crafts should be able to lift off by morning.Though I must say, and I think many here will agree it needs to be said, that I hope this event will open your eyes to the real reason we have age limits on active soldiers, no matter how decorated they are.Only one spoke back.Captain Diego Ferranti jumped to his feet, his blond curls floating in front of his face.If you are insinuating that the attack on the dock was somehow General Berenguers fault, I would tread carefully, Mauldeth!Hear, hear!cried Anthea Godno as though she had been waiting for a chance to get back at Mauldeth for his entering comment.And I would hold my tongue when speaking to a senior officer, boy!Mauldeth snapped.Ferranti went to retort, but Anna watched her uncle shake his head faintly.Still glaring at Mauldeth, Ferranti sat.That is quite enough, Pinzn said, rising from her seat.In line with what the General has already said, rumours of this successful attack have spread to many, if not all, Alignment worlds.Titans Twelve Cities penetrated for the first time in FIFTY YEARS!I wont have it!She slammed her fist onto the table, before taking three rapid breaths.As many of you know or will have guessed, intelligence points to Crilshan agents, who, in an attempt to assassinate General Berenguer, planted the device inside the Quasars shuttlecraft.Though how or when we have yet to discover.I also have much graver news.The time was arriving when you would have been informed of our plan to counter the Dishan Alliances renewed offensive ...but it now no longer matters.The summons to the Baren Igoth were being called clandestinely for over a month before the attack.Berenguer, Mauldeth, and I saw to it ourselves.Murmuring broke out among the tables.The Baren Igoth; Anna remembered being told of it in Contemporary History classes.The secret meeting had only ever been called twice, the last during the Titan Crilshan war of fifty years ago.Were things that serious?Silence!Mauldeth bellowed and the clamour died down.Pinzn continued with a sigh.However, it appears that with news of our recent attack, coupled with the vicious invasion of Rotavar, such fear has travelled far and wide, and so no world will now present itself at the Baren Igoth for fear of such an attack on its own people.Shocked faces lined the tables.Thats madness!said Diego Ferranti.Surely they must realise that we stand more chance of taking on the Dishan if we do so together!Every man for himself, Mendoza said, patting him on the shoulder.Thats human nature.Anna stared at her uncle Ruben.She could see it in his eyes: he had already known.That would explain his behaviour of late; the task appointed to him of summoning the Baren Igoth had failed.She looked beside him at Mauldeth, whose lip she was sure curled slightly as he too glanced at her uncles sullen face.But then, as though waking from a long sleep, Ruben blinked deeply, before sitting up and pointing to Anna.Admiral Estegran.Do any of you know how he died?Nobody replied.Anna breathed deeply, realising he was directing their attention to the statue of the man above her.Admiral Pavolo Estegran died, Ruben said, in service to the people of Titan.Eight hundred years ago the then tyrannical Empires of the Fourth System attacked the Third System.Accentauria was overwhelmed.Titan responded.Yes, to help our allies, but also to show the enemy that they could not get away with acts of such cold blood.He died proving that we were stronger together.Pinzn nodded as she returned to her seat.What I mean to say, my lady, is that the Systemal Alignment was once a united body.All worlds shared mutual respect and understanding.We fought together, celebrated with one another, and we lived and died in common purpose.As the leaders of Titan we must uphold this honour and reunite the Alignment, with or without the Baren Igoth.And how, said Mauldeth, do we do that, when no damn world will dare unite with us?Ruben smiled.There is one that will.Do you think so?Pinzn asked.He nodded.I implore you now, council members, to agree to aid the colony Rotavar against the invaders who now hold it to ransom.If we were to defeat the dark presence there we would not only gain a most loyal ally, but strengthen the belief among the Alignment that together it is possible to overcome the Dishan Alliance.Anna gazed around the room at the silence that came over them.Her uncles captains were nodding firmly, as were many across both tables.Captain Ferrantis curls hung across his face and Anna could have sworn there was a tear in his eye.There were a number of faces, however, which did not look convinced by Rubens line of reasoning, and Mauldeth himself, now red in the face, stood pompously from his seat and positioned himself behind Annas uncle.It is hard, he said, with such grand oration arguing the cause, to see past the proposal the general here is suggesting.Of course we could send a vessel or two to aid the arguably insignificant colony that is Rotavar.We could send a whole fleet and wipe out the entire Crilshan invasion force from the area!But consider this, council members: from a military perspective, which is why I am here and what I do best, liberating Rotavar is strategically futile.Their numbers come nowhere near the Dishan Alliances strength.Neither do ours for that matter.But wasting resources on  If we succeeded it would not be a waste, Ruben said.Oh, stop fooling yourself!Rotavar is a feeble world, nowhere near our might.That sounds awfully like something a Crilshan would say if you asked me!Ferranti responded, rising.Yes, well no one is asking you!Anna found herself edging forward and had to pull herself back.She so desperately wanted to fight her uncles corner.She watched her uncle put a hand to his temple as Ferranti and Mauldeth squared off.Both stood facing each other, faces fuming so intensely Anna thought smoke would pour from their ears.Pinzn rose and slammed her fist down on the table between them.That is enough!Compare egos all you wish, but a decision has been made.I admire the sincerity in all of your beliefs, but it is Titan I am trusted to protect.Titan alone.Ferranti and Mauldeth sat and listened to Lady Pinzn speak.Despite our best efforts, she said gravely, the Dishan Alliance has grown again to great power.The entire Second System is at their mercy.Proximan armadas already present difficulties for any unarmed vessel travelling close by.We cannot fight them alone, so we will begin by securing our own world as no doubt all others are doing.Idealism is exactly that, and we cannot afford to be unrealistic in these ever dangerous times.The worlds of the Four informed us of their allegiances when they refused their summons.And so I regret to inform you all that no aid will be sent to Rotavar murmuring at once broke out as General Mauldeth is correct: it would be a waste of resources.The day Slimar Mauldeth is correct, Ill drop dead of amusement!a voice cried from the chamber door, which once again found itself groaning wide open.Eighteen      Callista Berenguer watched dozens of shocked faces eye her from their seated positions.She took one step forward and at once the two guards stood inside took hold of her arms.Get off me!she said.Get off!After a minor scufflethe two men coming out of it worse than the old womanMaxim Pinzn waved the guards back outside and they hesitantly allowed the old Istron to enter.I have something that I would like to say, Callista said, hobbling into the room clutching her staff and dragging her oversized cloak along the marble floor.Oh, do put your yellow teeth away, Slimar!she said to Mauldeth, who had clenched his jaw as she entered.Seldom do we allow into our chamber any person not a member of the Council or Guard, Callista, Pinzn said.Especially when such a crucial meeting is taking place.Normally this conduct would result in a heavy punishment.Im sure youll grant me the honour, Maxim.We shall see.So ...speak.It would have taken a fool not to notice the tension that filled the room, or the rigidity with which many of the council members now sat.Callista knew that not all were familiar or indeed comfortable with the old woman, who had admittedly taken it upon herself to interfere with Council meetings and policies, knowing things about each of them that she really should not have known.Shuffling down the middle of the tables she smiled widely and greeted those captains and council members who supported Ruben.Diego Ferranti took her hand and kissed it courteously.She acted to the contrary but Callista wasnt opposed to the attention.The old woman reached the end of the tables and stood directly before Lady Pinzn.You do not trust me, Maxim, and I dont trust you, she said, frankly.But you are our Lady and in command.I know deep down you want what it best for Titan and its people, but the dark power ascending from Crilshar and the System of Proxima will engulf each and every world, one by one, until none is left.And if we are strong enough to last until the end, the end it will still be.It seemed to Callista as though Pinzn was really considering her words; she continued to sit back in silence.But the quiet did not last long.Are we actually entertaining this crack pot?said Mauldeth.If you dont like what I have to say, you could always drag me out the room yourself, she retorted, coolly.Oh I dont have to.Mauldeth stood and raised his arm.The guards nearby moved forwards, ready to take hold of the old woman.Very funny, she chuckled.Then again, Slimar, you always were quite amusing.Guard, escort her out!Ruben stood.That isnt necessary.Mauldeths supporters rose from their seats at that moment, hands on their holstered weapons, as did Captains Ferranti and Mendoza, knocking back the chairs behind them.Anthea Godno clambered out of her chair too, though she found herself surrounded by opposition.Callista walked slowly towards Mauldeth, aware that Anna edged more and more from behind her statue.Stay where you are, child.You strut in here, Mauldeth spat, acting like our lady, when all agree you are past any and all use.Crawl back to your bedsit, crow.And if I dont?Oh, you will.He glanced to the additional men now entering the chamber.Call them all, General.Youve demonstrated your prowess, wooden as it is.He smiled toothily and gestured to the armed men.Stay where you are!she uttered to them deeply, and everyones eyes widened in shock as the Titanese Guard stopped advancing and stood as still as the stone statues set around the room.Drag her out!Mauldeth said.DO IT!Again the Istron spoke.Stay where you are!And no one moved.Very well, he said, removing the coil from his belt.No!Ruben said, moving to stop the man from stunning her.Mauldeth pushed Ruben aside and Ferranti lunged forward.Callista raised her staff as the dark general ignited his weapon.STOP!Every last body turned in silent shock to see Anna Berenguer, who had leapt from her hiding place, now stood petrified before them.Maxim Pinzn fell back into her chair, quite obviously exhausted.Is nobody guarding this meeting anymore?Nineteen      Antal Justus stumbled through nothingness, at the edge of oblivion.Surrounded by darkness, and unable to hear a thing, it was as though he had been deafened by a clamour wave or some nearby explosion.He stretched out his hands to feel around and slowly came into contact with a rough, jagged surface.It felt cold to touch, like rock hidden deep beneath the ground.Taking one uncertain step forward he focused his eyes ahead, blinking continually just to ensure his eyes werent closed as, faced by a black void, it appeared they still were.He continued onward for mere minutes before he saw it: a light, straight ahead, dim and flickering as though it was moving.Justus dashed after it.He moved as fast as he could while drowning in the crushing darkness.He ran and ran ...the light became closer ...his heart beat faster and faster, drumming out the rhythm in his racing strides.Then he heard the word he always heard when he dreamt.Gilaxiad!Gilaxiad!Gilaxiad!It was a womans voice, which itself became louder and stronger.He didnt recognise it.He never did.He came to the end of the tunnel and stopped dead in his tracks.Ahead glowed the dark, perpetual, all consuming orb hed seen in his nightmares for as far back as he could remember.But something was different.There was somebody there with him.It was a girl.
