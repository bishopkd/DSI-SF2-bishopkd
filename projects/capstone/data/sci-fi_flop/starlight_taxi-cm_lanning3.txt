The driver gave an accurate description of the man and discussed what hed seen with the officer for a minute or two.He showed the officer his ID card and identified himself as a cab driver with the Starlight Taxi company.I see.Looks like based on what I found here, the young lady killed was just unlucky...wrong place, wrong time.Did you notice the suspect in the cafe while you were in there?No, but to be honest, I was just reading the news.The only person I noticed was the girl when she tied up her dog here, the driver said.Right...the dog.Well, I dont really know what to do about him, Bradley said, scratching his head and putting his notepad away.Its a girl, the driver said.Oh.My bad.You seem to have bonded with the dog in a short bit, Bradley said.I just gave her some leftovers is all.Whats going to happen to her?Well, to be honest, were really swamped during this time of the year.Tracking down her owners family will certainly be done, but taking the dog to them...well thats not exactly on the top of our minds at the moment.You wanna take her for the time being?Me?Yeah.You dont have to.If you dont, Ill just leave the dog in the custody of our animal control officer until we can get her owners family to come up and get her, but that could be a while...and theres always the chance the family wont want her, Bradley said.What happens then?The officer sighed and just shook his head.There are a lot of dogs in the universe.If this one isnt claimed right away, itll probably just be put down, considering how old she is.She probably only has a couple years left in her anyway, Bradley said.The driver sighed.As calm as the animal was, shed probably ride in the passenger seat just fine and nap most of the day.He could take her out and play with her at night when he got home or even just let her run around his small fenced in yard.Yeah, Ill take her.If the family wants her back, you have my information, the driver said.He walked over to the dog and kneeled down.Im sorry about what happened to your owner.I cant bring her back but...do you want to come with me?The dog sat down and put up her paw.The driver took it and gently moved his hand up and down.Someone clearly taught you how to shake, the driver said, smiling.He untied the dog, and his earpiece buzzed again.Driver 2269, is there a problem?We indicate that your cab is still in the same place it was when last we spoke, the same womans voice said.Sorry.Im leaving now.A gunman shot a woman at the cafe I was in.I had to stay behind to give my statement, the driver said.Are you okay to drive?Yes.Im not injured, the driver said.His hand brushed over the huskys blue collar, and he noticed there was a small metal tag on the bottom.He saw a name inscribed on it.So, your name is Solstice?Thats pretty, the driver said as the husky looked up at him when he said her name.He walked her back to Starla and opened the passenger door.She didnt hesitate to hop in and sit in the seat.Well, youve clearly ridden in a vehicle before, the driver said.He walked around and got into his seat, starting Starla up.Her engine whined a little, as it always did when he started her up, but it stopped after a few seconds.Taking Starla up to the entrance, he waited patiently for the airlock to open.When it did, he moved forward slowly leaving the port and entering a closed off section where outgoing ships wait for the outer gate to open.The system kept the inner section of the plaza from losing pressure and oxygen.As soon as a green light appeared, the exit opened, and the driver accelerated Starla forward and got onto Intergalactic Road One, heading straight for the moon.Neo Rome was one of many cities on the moon that took its name from its counterpart on Earth but had no relation to it.Most of the neo cities were creative havens, places where those with tastes for high culture gathered and celebrated their love of fine art.Art could be anything from dancing, to music, to paintings, to all sorts of other things the driver didnt much care for.A majority of the people in the lunar cities simply used electron transporters to get where they wanted to go, so, the driver didnt get many calls to service residents who lived on the moon.As Starla entered the moons artificial atmosphere, she immediately got onto Lunar Highway 34 and followed the signs for Neo Rome.Twenty minutes later, the taxi was pulling into the downtown area and navigating through traffic.It was roughly 12:45 p. m.  local time, and traffic was heavy as everyone headed to lunch.Solstice dozed off quickly upon entering the moons atmosphere, and she hadnt stirred since then.Every once in a while her ears would twitch, but other than that, she was gone.You have the right idea, girl, the driver said, running his fingers through her soft fur.He couldnt help but notice she didnt smell at all.Her previous owner must have bathed her often.Surrounded by skyscrapers, the driver started to get claustrophobic.He didnt like driving in big cities or staying there for long.He looked around at the commotion and people walking when he finally saw a little spot where the sidewalk cut inward, and a small vehicle could parallel park off the road.He pulled Starla into the little area and reached over for a cigarette.He pounded the top of the glovebox, and it opened.A small white pack of cigarettes fell out.His hand fumbled for them, and when he pulled the pack back toward him, Solstice awoke and gently grabbed the drivers hand with her mouth.What the Hell, he gasped.She wasnt biting down on him in the least, but when he tried to pull his hand free, she wouldnt let him go.Let me go, he growled.She did not, and he realized at once she must smell the cigarettes.He loosened his grip, and the pack fell to the floorboard.Before he could grab them with his other hand, her head snapped down, picked them up, and nestled them under her.She then went back to sleep, cutting the driver off from his source of nicotine.I dont believe it, he muttered.When he tried to pry them from her, she refused to budge, still laying on top of them.His feud with his new companion was interrupted by a knock on the back window.A young woman with long black hair was outside.He cracked his back window and asked for the womans name.Im Josephine, the one who called for you, she said.He unlocked the door, and she got in.I was waiting across the street for you.I almost didnt see you pull in here, she said.Sorry.I couldnt cut across the traffic easily, the driver said.He looked at her, and she was wearing a small black dress with random red stitching sewn across it.Ill never understand these artistic kids and their fashion, the driver thought.Where to?Tulsa, she said, almost sort of depressed.Yes maam, the driver said, pulling Starla back out into traffic and then working his way out of Neo Rome.Once they were back on Lunar Highway 34, the driver looked back at his silent passenger.She had been staring out the window watching the city get smaller and smaller.At one point, he was even sure he saw a tear in her left eye.She had brown eyes and a round figure.She wasnt overweight...she was healthy, having curves in the right places.Josephine had a little bit of meat on her bones.Her face was what set her apart though.She looked sort of like a gypsy.There was something exotic about her, and the driver immediately sensed a rebellious spirit in his presence.She had probably left home, but not in the same way his pizza boy passenger from a few weeks ago did.She had a much more clear goal...trying to make it big in the city.The driver hypothesized that Josephine was the kind of girl who was trying to shake off her small town life like dust from an apron.It was humiliating to her to be born in such a small place when she had such high and dramatic aspirations.How did the audition go?Excuse me?I see the script sticking out of your purse.How did the audition go?Wow...youre observant, she said.I try to be.Its how I make conversation, the driver said, petting Solstice lightly as Starla left the moon and headed back toward Earth.It was a failure...like everything else I tried in Neo Rome, Josephine said, looking out at the stars.You didnt have what they wanted?Oh, I had what they wanted.The problem was...as soon as I got done screwing the casting director, I didnt have what they wanted anymore, she said.The girl was blunt for a young lady in her early 20s.The driver found that somewhat refreshing.Sorry to hear it...but...youre aware Tulsa doesnt have as many theatrical opportunities as Neo Rome does, right?Ive no choice.Im out of money, Josephine said, still not making eye contact with the driver.After a slight awkward silence, Josephine caught what shed said and changed her story slightly, I mean...I have enough to pay you for the ride, but I dont have the money to keep living in that city.That took a load off the drivers mind.After he accepted that pizza as payment, his boss had taken the cost of the fuel from his paycheck that week, which made him mad at that punk ass kid even more.Family in Tulsa?South of Tulsa by about an hour or so.I have a friend in Tulsa who Im going to stay a night or two with in order to detox.Those lunar cities just have a way to putting something into you...and although I loved being there...I did not enjoy wasting all my saved money for a few blown opportunities, she said.Maybe you can save up a bit more and head back in a year or two, the driver suggested.Yeah...Ill probably work for my parents for a bit and then try again, she said, sighing.What do your parents do?Theyre jewelers, she said.Jewelers...that must make them a pretty penny, the driver said.It buys them a small house in a small town and gives them enough money to fill a small fridge, Josephine muttered.The driver thought about trying to make another swipe for his cigarettes but decided against it when Solstice, seemingly reading his mind, awoke again and just stared at him blankly.Damn dog, he thought to himself.Well, ya know...a full fridge in the middle of nowhere is better than an empty fridge in Neo Rome, the driver said.She scoffed and said, Id happily eat nothing for a week just to get another shot at one more gig.This cost her a little respect in the mind of the driver.He sighed and realized she was ungrateful.She was going home to a family that would care for her and pay her salary for a year or two.Then, when she had what she wanted, shed pack her bags and leave to try again at an unlikely acting career later.She probably hadnt even spoken to her parents until she needed to come home, the driver though, scowling a little.Have you ever been so desperate for an audience that youd give anything to have their love on stage for a night?Missy, look at me.Im a cab driver in his early 40s that smokes and drives around with a husky in my front seat.Do I look like the kind of guy who has ever desired an audience?You mean you drive this car because you want to?This cars name is Starla.Shes the one hauling your butt back home to your friends residence on Earth.And yes, I drive her because I want to.I happen to like my job and the fact that I come from a small town, the driver said, almost boasting.What a dull existence, Josephine said, clearly unimpressed.The driver said nothing, and she filled the silence with her own thoughts and dreams.Just imagine it.You walk out on a lit stage, spill your guts delivering lines straight from your soul, and they applaud, crying, unable to get enough.Thats the kind of life I want and will have someday, Josephine said.Do you feel you need the attention of others to be satisfied with your life?Thats just it, mister cab driver, I dont want to just be satisfied with my life.I want to live every day in ecstasy, my existence being pushed to the max.Someday, when Ive got the heart of every man and woman in Neo Rome, Ill have that life, she said, smiling, lost in her own world.The driver was sure he hated her at this point.She was too stupid to realize it, but shed never be satisfied.I feel sorry for your parents, the driver thought to himself.When he came down into Tulsa, which was much smaller than Neo Rome, she paid him in wrinkled cash.He didnt want to know what shed done to get the money, but he had his fare.It wasnt his job to care about her past this point.She grabbed her purse and was out of Starla without saying another word.The driver left Tulsa and went south for about 30 minutes.When he stopped the cab, he was in the middle of nowhere.He opened the passenger door and let Solstice out to stretch her legs and do her business.Well Solstice, I dont know about you, but Im glad to have that girl out of my cab.Shes a time bomb waiting to explode, and that ecstasy she wants so bad is only going to get her in some big trouble down the line, the driver said.She cocked her head sideways listening patiently to him, and then he said, Hell, no need to bog you down with thoughts of her.Go do your business.Instead, Solstice took off running after a rabbit in a nearby field.While she ran, he reached inside his passenger seat to grab his cigarettes.He smoked and thought a little more about the tough life her parents must have.Some people just dont appreciate what they have, Solstice.She ran up to him with a stick in her mouth, but she stopped about ten feet away, growling.The driver sighed as a northern wind picked up.He held onto his hat with one hand and threw his cigarette to the ground with the other.Stomping it out, he said, There, are you happy now?He started to walk toward her to take the stick and throw it, but she walked past him and peed on his cigarette.Thats just lovely.Do you want me to throw that for you or not, you horses petute?She walked over and gave him the stick.He then turned around and hurled it as far as he could.This dog is going to kill me, the driver muttered, hanging onto his hat as another breeze picked up.5: A Peculiar Old Man  The driver was showering when he heard his earpiece buzzing on the counter.He didnt have to clock in for another two hours, so, he didnt usually answer his ear piece.If his boss truly needed him, hed dial his home phone.As he ran the bar of green soap over his body, he looked at the long scars that covered his torso and remembered the accident that put them there.The deep lines looked like small canyons running both vertically and horizontally across his body.Sure wish I could afford the surgery to get rid of those ugly things, the driver muttered.He said that, but he knew in the back of his mind that he would hesitate before deciding to go under the knife and remove them.For starters, he hated doctors, and he avoided them as much as possible.Second, he operated under the belief of If it aint broke, dont fix it.Although the scars were clearly a sign of a broken body, they didnt really bother him physically.It wasnt like he felt constant pain or they kept him from doing anything in life.Deciding to put his thoughts on the day ahead, he wondered who hed pick up today.Scratching on his bathroom door made him realize it was time to get out of the shower.He sighed and absorbed another minute or two of hot water.In truth, he loved taking scalding hot showers, and hed stay in there all day if it wouldnt run up his water bill to a ridiculous level.Turning off the shower, he got out and was hit by the colder air in his bathroom.Go lie down, Solstice.Ill be out in a minute, the driver said.The scratching on the door stopped, and his red husky walked across the floor to her bed to lie down and wait patiently for her friend to get her breakfast.The driver wrapped his towel, a personalized brown cotton bath towel with his initials sewn into it, around his waist and went out into the living room where Solstice was waiting on him.His usual routine in the morning was to get up around 6:30 a. m.  and hop into the shower.If he went too far past 7 a. m. , shed come scratch on the door, wanting breakfast.She sat up and stared at him from her brown and white doggie bed as he walked behind his black leather couch and into the kitchen.Reaching above his fridge, he opened his wooden cabinets and pulled out a can of turkey flavored dog food, her favorite.Solstice had followed him into the kitchen and was panting excitedly next to her red plastic food dish that was a little to the left of the sink on a small towel with her blue plastic water dish.Pulling out a white can opener, he put the dog food on the counter and attached the tool to the can.Turning the hand key, he watched the can slowly spin on the counter.Solstice waited patiently until he put the food in her bowl and stepped away before she devoured her meal.Well, I gotta hand it to her...the gal does have some restraint, waiting until I put the food down and not jumping on me while Im getting it ready, the driver muttered going back into the bathroom.Fifteen minutes later, he was almost ready to leave.He walked into his living room and opened the sliding door that went back out onto his small patio.Solstice.Go do your business, he said.She did as she was told and trotted outside.She was usually good after that.She rode in his front seat and didnt bark or anything.Some customers were a little wary of her at first, but she usually slept when others were in the vehicle, so, they couldnt care less.The red husky pawed lightly on the sliding glass when she was ready to come back inside.The driver didnt have a big yard, but his little single story blue townhouse did have enough of one that she could roam around the back part of it inside a fence and be okay for a while.There was a large fastiaga tree in the back that was about 40 feet tall.It provided shade for half the yard, and Solstice had grown accustomed to an afternoon nap under it on the drivers off days.The driver and Solstice exited his blue townhouse and walked over to Starla.Before he made it to his cab, he saw his neighbors Travis and Krickett next door.He saw what appeared to be Krickett in a tiger costume laying on the grass while Travis attempted to paint her.Ill never understand those two, the driver thought to himself as he got inside and turned on Starla.Her engine hummed to life, taking a few seconds to wake up.Well, at least they never cause me trouble, the driver muttered.The driver had mostly good luck with his neighbors in the small city of Lefont.Travis and Krickett were a little weird, but he never had any trouble from them...although one time their cat had snuck into his house through an open window and pounced on his bed.The black furball was immediately grabbed and carried by the scruff of his neck back over to his rightful home.They were very apologetic, and the driver never had another problem out of them.Still, if that cat insisted on breaking and entering again, hed find a nice surprise with multiple teeth waiting for him.Solstice had never attacked anyone, but she was growing rather possessive of her new owner as of late.She didnt like to be away from him for long, and she didnt like anyone else getting too close.When someone did get close, shed usually walk between the driver and the other person and sit down, acting as a barrier.The red husky didnt growl...she simply placed herself there to let the stranger know that the driver was HER friend.The driver was heading for the Starlight Taxi hub in Lefont when his earpiece buzzed.You didnt pick up when I rang this morning, a familiar voice said.Great.Its always a wonderful start to a day when my boss calls me personally, the driver thought.
