He found out that he would have to climb quickly, or the sun baked metal would burn his hands.***Cliff and Gavin headed out over the wide desert floor towards the nearest hills.As they walked towards a dip, the hard dirt floor changed to a dusty powder that swirled around their heavy magnetic boots, and static made the dust cling to their boots.Cliff wiped sweat off of his forehead.Dry, yellow grass covered the ground and stickers and thorns were scattered over the patches of bare dirt.After plunging through some bushes that scraped and tore at their Purple Man jumpsuits, they jumped off a short ledge and emerged into a dry, sandy streambed.A steep dirt wall going up from the sandy bottom marked the other side of the streambed.The wall must have been formed where the ground had fallen away during a flood of water."Lets hope that water runs in this gully fairly often," Cliff remarked as he noticed the washout.They found a low spot in the far wall and scrambled up the crumbling dirt ledge.The hills were much closer now.After a while, they found one of the spiny plants that they had noticed in the distance.It was made of dark green spines radiating out in a ball from a short, thick stalk.The spines were curved like celery, and ended in a hard point.A tall skinny stalk pointed up from the middle of the plant and had a cluster of white bulb like flowers on it.Gavin grabbed the stalk of flowers and broke it off, and Mabok tried pulling some of the spines out.After a while, he ended up cutting a few off."Well see if we can eat these," Gavin commented as they headed back to the Shark.Over the stream bed in the distance they could see clusters of men standing on top of the hull of the Pinak and several milling around below on the ground.***"It looks like the men are enjoying their new freedom," Mabok said with a smile.***After a short debate, Javier was chosen to figure out a way to eat the spines of the plant.He cut off the sharp tips and chopped up the rest.Denz fashioned a metal pot for him, and some of the others collected dry branches.Soon they had a fire going and Javier carefully dropped the bulbs and spines into the water.He boiled them for twenty minutes before he decided to test them out.The crew was so hungry, that it wasnt hard to find volunteers to try the first taste.The bulbs just boiled apart in the water, so Javier threw them out, but the spines cooked up in one piece.Joe got picked as the first to taste it.He put a piece in his mouth, bit down on it, and chewed it for a while.The men could tell it was tough work by Joes expression.After a while, he swallowed a little of it."How is it?"Wes asked anxiously."It tastes like wood."The men moaned and some threw up their hands.Joe didnt take any more pieces to eat and the rest of the men dispersed to find some shade.Wes lingered close to the fire, grabbed a couple pieces, and popped one in his mouth."Youre going to eat that?"Javier asked."At least it will give my stomach something to work on," Wes said with a shrug.***After an hour, Javier and Wes were lying in the shadow of the Shark.They preferred to be outside, even though it was hot, because they were sick of seeing the inside of the ship.Wes accused Javier of being a lousy cook, and the two argued back and forth for a while.Eventually the conversation died out, until Cliff walked past with a string of water bottles over his shoulder.He was wearing his Earth clothes and shoes."Hey," Wes called, "Where are you going, Cliff?""Im going to look for some food.""Are you going to find any?"Wes asked."Yep.""Then Im coming too," Wes said as he stood up, dusted himself off, and trotted after Cliff."Dont think you can get food without sharing some with me," Javier called out as he scrambled after them.Calvins dog Baker barked as he followed on their heels.They headed out into the flatland in the same direction that Gavin and Cliff had taken earlier, but when they got to the dry stream, they turned and followed its sandy bed."Its almost easier to walk through the bushes than to walk in this sand," Javier grumbled."Yeah," Cliff agreed, "Ive got a bunch of sand in my shoes.""In the arroyos back home," Wes said, "We used to walk in the tire tracks, where the dirt was packed down."Cliff stopped the other two with an outstretched arm."Did you see that?"he asked."What?""I saw a bird flying away over there," Cliff said as he pointed to some bushes."We could eat birds!"Javier said with excitement."How are we going to catch them, do do brain?"Wes asked, "With a lasso?""Come on, you guys," Cliff cut in, "Enough of the arguing.""Sorry," Javier replied, "We get a little grumpy on an empty stomach."Wes drank from a water bottles and then poured some out on his head.Javier took the water bottle and started drinking."I think Im feeling a little sick," Wes grumbled as he looked at the sun."This warm water doesnt help much," Javier said as he wiped sweat off of his forehead.The three men continued on until the streambed widened out into a flat depression.Gentle slopes covered with scrub curved up in the distance and the streambed widened out until it almost disappeared.A large dead tree grew out of the dirt a ways ahead of them."Thats strange," Wes said to himself, "How could a tree grow here?""Look at that!"Javier exclaimed, "It looks like a hawk!"On top of a lone, stubby branch of the tree, a dark bird perched motionless.As the men got closer, it stretched its wings and flew off with heavy beats of its wings."That would make some meat," Javier sighed as he watched it."We should have brought some of those guns.""Right," Wes said sarcastically with a roll of his eyes, "Those Purple Man guns would make chop suey out of a bird like that.Wed be looking for pieces of meat with a magnifying glass.""Hey guys!"Cliff called from farther ahead, "Look at this!"Javier and Wes walked over to Cliff, who was standing over by some plants.When they got close, they found that it was one large plant that spread in all directions like a vine.The vine had fuzzy branches lying close to the ground and dark green leaves."Looks kind of like a watermelon plant," Wes said as he looked yards away to the other edge of the plant.Several parts of the plant had died and were yellow and dried out.Cliff pointed over to one of the dry vines."Look," he said, "There are little fruits. "Wes leaned down and took a close look at the fruits, which were smooth and yellow and were a little bigger than a baseball."Looks like some kind of gourd," Wes said as he picked one up and pulled the vine off.He brushed a little dirt off of the bottom of it and turned it over in his hands."I bet we could eat these.Probably taste like dirt, but we could eat them."Cliff looked at Javier and asked, "Are you up to cooking again?""I guess," Javier answered.He took off his shirt, tied the bottom in a knot, and then they all began picking up gourds and putting them inside.After a while they had the shirt full, and Cliff stuffed a few gourds in his pockets before they headed back to the Pinak.As soon as they got back, Javier sat in the shade of the ship and took out a borrowed knife.With Wes looking on, he cut the hard skin of a gourd and pulled it open.The inside was filled with a white stringy mass and scattered throughout were flat, oval shaped seeds."What do you think?"Wes asked."I think I can work with this," Javier said.After half an hour, the men lined up for food.Javier sat next to the smoldering fire as the men came up to him with their improvised dishes and silverware."Now, you know that I could have done better with some more time," Javier said as he served up spoonful of mash onto Joes plate."Im too hungry to wait," Joe said, "Give me another spoonful."Javier gave him another blob of the boiled gourd and continued to dish it as the other men in the line came up to him.When everyone had taken a share, there was barely enough left for Javier.He didnt think that the men would have wanted so much, but he must have underestimated how hungry they were."How is it, boys?"Javier asked as he grabbed some with his fingers."A lot better than the last stuff," Joe said as he chewed laboriously."It doesnt have much taste to it, and its pretty stringy," Calvin said between bites, "But itll do in a pinch."Javier didnt care that it was bland, either, as long as it filled him up.As they sat eating, he noticed that the sun was getting lower and the Sharks shadow was getting much longer.At least now it would cool off.***As the sun dipped behind the horizon and the temperature cooled, Jeff organized a search party to go to the top of the nearby line of hills and take a look around.Denz volunteered to go with Jeff, who also took Joe, Frank and Sam.They were all loaded with bottles of water.Even though the men were reluctant to carry the extra weight, Jeff made them take guns also.As the five men set off, the twilight dragged on.The sky still had a slight pink tint where the sun had set."The days are long here," Joe said as they trudged through the dust, "It still isnt dark."Frank juggled his water bottle and took a gulp as he walked.The air was still warm enough that they were sweating.As they started up the foot of a rust colored hill, the scrub and thorns thickened and they found themselves crawling under branches, and wrestling plants aside in order to keep going up.The reddish rocks were still warm to the touch.They startled several birds, which fluttered off quickly.After scrambling up some jagged rocks and pulling themselves onto the top of the hill, they got their first look around.A few peaks were visible towards the dim glow where the sun had set.Jeff started jotting down some notes and scanning the horizon with binoculars."Well call that way west," Jeff said, pointing to where the sun had gone down.In the east, foreboding mountains stretched across the horizon.Even though they were jagged and barren, the sharp shadows and pink glow made them beautiful.In between them and the western horizon, they could see the Shark, with yellow light emanating from the windows and hatches.The streambed below them continued north until it branched into a larger riverbed, which was also dry.As Jeff noted the different landmarks around them, Frank and Sam continued along the rocky crest of the hill."It looks like theres  " Jeff began to say.A clattering of rocks and a yell from Frank stopped him.Jeff could see Frank lying on the ground.Sam, who was nearby, ran over to Frank to see if he was hurt, but Frank held out his hand to warn Sam from getting close.Frank was holding his left leg with his hand and grimacing."Whats wrong?"Sam called from several yards away."Load your gun," Frank called, "Something bit me.It's over there."Sam hastily fed a cylinder into his gun and powered it up, snatching glances in Franks direction."Where is it?"Sam called."Somewhere over there in those boulders," Frank said, pointing to some large rocks about ten feet away."But I cant see it in this light.Ooh, my leg is going numb."Sam strained to see it, but it was hidden among the rocks in the darkness.Jeff came up next to Sam and raised his gun also.Frank lifted himself up on his hands and began to slide backwards along the rocks.Then he heard a hiss and a large creature leapt onto him.Jeff saw the creature leap up onto Frank and fired his gun.Then he lost sight of it in the shadows.Denz was with them now, and he pulled a thermal knife and started towards the creature.Jeff saw the thing move again and heard Sams gun fire.The creature jumped, this time landing on a patch of pale dirt.Denz could see it easily and he leapt on top of it, jammed his knife into its neck as hard as he could, and then sprang back on his feet.The thing lay still."Lets get out of here quick," Sam said as he loaded his gun and looked around him.Jeff ran over to the motionless creature and looked it over."You help Frank," Jeff said, pointing to Sam, "And the rest of you help me with this.""You want to take it with us?"Sam asked, astonished."It might make good food," Jeff said as he grabbed one of the things limbs and began to pull.Denz sheathed his knife and reluctantly grabbed the other side of the beast.Jeff motioned Joe to come over and lift its head.Joe winced with disgust and grabbed the things head.They headed down the rocky slope as quickly as they could, grunting and straining to get down.Unseen thorns and branches scraped against them in the dimming light and they were breathing hard by the time they reached level ground.They were startled by the sound of a tumbling rock or scraping branch.At the bottom, they headed out across the sand, dragging the beast behind them and leaving a furrow in the sand from the beasts tail.Frank limped along with Sams help, stirring up clouds of dust with his leg.They heard shouting from Gavin and Javier, who had heard the gunfire and came running in their general direction."Were over here!"Frank yelled, and soon the two men got to them."Franks hurt," Sam said.Javier turned on a flashlight and went over to Frank, who pulled up one pant leg.In the light, they could see some painful looking red depressions in a circular pattern on his leg.In a couple of places the skin had broken and bled a little."Ill check it out back at the ship," Javier said, "It doesnt look too bad.""Shine that light over here," Jeff called.Javier went over to the men carrying the beast.They dropped it to the ground with a thud.The animal was very heavy and it was a relief to get a rest.Joe had blood on his shirt from the things neck.When the light shone on the animal, Denz gasped sharply.It was covered with overlapping gray and brown scales about three inches long.It had a large head and mouth, four legs with long, sharp toes, and a wide, flat tail with a pointed end.It had small eyes and large, bowl like depressions on each side of its head, which must have been its ears."Reminds me of the Wadi Kahn!"Denz exclaimed."Whats the Wadi Kahn?"Gavin asked."Its a planet in stories for the Hadran children.It has chimera that roam there, or beasts like this one," Denz answered."Can you eat them?"Joe asked."I dont know.""Lets get it back to the ship and find out," Jeff said.The men crouched down, grabbed the chimera, and lifted it with a grunt.***Wes woke up slowly.It felt like it was morning.He lay in bed for a while, but couldnt get back to sleep.He opened his eyes and slid the panel open on his bunk.He looked around, and others were still sleeping in their bunks.He stretched and headed up to the ships top hatch, which was open.Cold, crisp breezes drifted in through the hatch, and Wes shivered.He climbed up the ladder and peeked out the hatch.It was still dark outside, and the stars were shining brightly.He was about to go back below when he smelled smoke, with a hint of something else with it.He shuddered with the cold, but climbed up anyway to get on top of the hull to look over the edge.There was a large fire going below with something cooking on a spit and some men huddled around it.He slid quickly down the rungs of the ships ladder and over to the warmth of the fire before he squeezed between two other men.He looked at the strange hunk of meat cooking over the fire."Whats that?"he asked."Chimera leg," Jeff answered."Can you eat it?""Its pretty good," Joe answered as he leaned over to the spit and cut off a hunk of meat.He handed it to Wes, who juggled the steaming meat in his hands and bit a piece out of it.It was light meat and tasted good.Wes was so hungry that he wolfed down the rest, without waiting for it to cool.After he had several more pieces, he sat back."It seems like it should be morning now," Wes said."It should," Cliff said, from across the fire, "Ive been watching the stars, and it looks like a day here is about forty eight hours.""I wonder how Frank is doing," Jeff said."Lets go check on him," Gavin said as he got up.Jeff followed him."What happened to Frank?"Wes asked as he jogged to catch up.Jeff explained what had happened as they headed into the Sharks equipment bay and found Frank lying on the floor in some blankets.He was awake."Hows the leg?"Jeff asked."My legs doing much better," Frank said as he lifted it up and flexed it back and forth."After a couple of hours, I got the feeling back in it and the bite started to hurt.Javier says it must have got some venom in it, because just the bite by itself couldnt have deadened my whole leg like that.""What was it like?"Wes asked."Kind of like my whole leg was paralyzed," Frank answered."Its a good thing it wore off," Jeff said, and patted his shoulder."Just take it easy for a while to make sure there will be no more ill effects.""Are there more of those chimera out there?"Wes asked."There might be," Jeff said, "As soon as the meat is done cooking, I want everyone back in the Shark to make sure no one gets attacked by another one.""Wheres the rest of the chimeras body?"Wes asked."Over there," Jeff pointed to the other side of the bay.Javier was looking at it and picking at it with a knife.Wes went over to look at it.The head was the only big piece left, with the rest of it mainly just pieces of the bones and scales.Javier looked up to see Wes coming."Check this out!"Javier said.He rolled the heavy head over and opened up its mouth.He pointed to something inside the mouth with his knife."These are venom sacs.I accidentally got some on my finger and it stung for a while and went numb.Itll probably wear off, though, judging from Franks bite.""How big was this puppy?"Wes asked."It was about eight feet long, four feet high, and about 250 pounds," Javier answered."It had a cool diamond shaped pattern on its back scales.""This thing gives me the willies," Wes said, shaking his head."Tastes alright, though," Javier said."Yeah, tastes good."***Meanwhile, Gavin, Cliff and Jeff gathered together on the other side of the bay.Jeff looked concerned."I think we need to get out of here as soon as possible," he said, and then pointed to the remains of the chimera with his thumb, "That animal was extremely fast, and hard to spot.I dont like the thought of the men wandering around and getting eaten."Gavin shook his head, "Weve got to get food, and this planet is the only chance we have.""Well, then, lets get a bunch of food tomorrow and then get out of here," Jeff suggested, "We might be able to get a couple more of those animals and a bunch of gourds and take off.""Its awful nice to be on a planet again, though," Cliff said, "and I will be able to spend more time studying the maps if I dont have to navigate.""Cliff has a point," Gavin said, "Its not much use leaving until we know where we are going, and Cliff can spend all of his time doing calculations instead of plotting new maps as we go.""Okay," Jeff conceded, "but we still need to stock up on food so we can leave eventually.If we can figure out how to preserve the meat, we can store a lot of that.""How are we going to kill more of those chimera?"Gavin asked."Well have to shoot them," Cliff answered."How much ammunition do we have?"Gavin asked Jeff.Jeff scowled."Id say around one hundred shots; not much.""Tomorrow," Gavin said, "I want you to go hunting, Jeff, and Cliff can get more of the gourds.But Cliff, make sure you take some guns along too, just in case you run into trouble."The men nodded and left.The air grew colder and colder as the long night continued.Soon, the rest of the men came into the Shark with the meat and closed all the hatches to keep in the heat while they slept.***The morning sunlight was already shining through the cockpit windows when Jeff and his team were ready to leave the Shark in search of more food.Cliff and his men were still rummaging up equipment they could use to haul gourds back to the ship, while Gavins men were to stay behind at the Shark.The morning outside was very still and peaceful, and just beginning to warm up from the rays of the sun.Jeff pulled the lever that opened the equipment bay door and then turned around to pick up his backpack and the rest of his gear.Joe and Sam were across the bay, still a little sleepy from the long night, and oblivious to everything.Chuck had taken Franks place on Jeffs team and he was wide awake and ready to go.Thats why he was the first to spot it.It was looking right at him with a steady gaze and just sitting there motionless.Chuck didnt dare to move, and put his hand out from his side to tap Jeff."Close the door," he whispered as he kept his eyes on the chimera outside the Shark.Jeff looked at him questioningly, but noticed Chucks face and knew it was serious.He jammed the lever back, and the door creaked and began to close."Everyone stay still," Chuck said, a little louder this time.By now, the others had followed his stare and spotted the chimera also.They could see it breathe.The chimera leaped forward through the bay door at that instant and headed towards Jeff at lightning speed.Jeff threw himself to the side into a pile of trash.Chuck jumped backwards to get out of the chimeras way.He spun and grabbed a grappling hook gun and pulled it around.The chimera jumped towards Jeff and sent debris flying in all directions as it plowed into the pile of trash.It stopped for an instant, with its front legs perched on a crate and its mouth open wide.Chuck fired the grappling hook, which thudded against the chimera and spun it around a little.It turned to face Chuck, but then it heard Jeff rustling around in the trash.A sharp crack rang out inside the bay, so loud that it pounded Chucks chest.Jeff had fired his gun.The chimera sprang back and Chuck saw that one of its legs was gone, but its missing limb didnt stop it.By now, Joe had loaded his gun and he fired, and the chimera collapsed against the wall.Sam started towards Jeff when he noticed a darting shadow out of the corner of his eye, and he was suddenly slammed to the floor by another chimera.He fell on his stomach and felt a sharp pain in his leg, and then an immense weight on top of him.Chuck saw the second chimera enter the bay and jump on Sam.Chuck fired his gun, but missed.Joe was desperately loading his gun to fire again, and Chuck grabbed a fire extinguisher.He sprayed the chimera that attacked Sam, but then turned to spray a third chimera in the face as it came towards him.It had come through the bay door, which was now only open about three feet.The mist from the extinguisher surrounded him.Chuck saw a chimera through the fog as it left through the open bay door.It was dragging something.Then he heard some more shots.More men were in the bay now and firing fast.Chuck loaded his gun.The door closed and there were two dead chimeras in the bay."Wheres Sam!"Jeff shouted desperately as he clambered out of the trash pile.He threw bags and boxes to either side as he searched through the scattered pile of debris."They got him!"Jose yelled as he loaded his gun.He had entered the bay just in time to see the chimera take Sam out.As soon as he was done loading, he ran for the cockpit hatch with Jeff close behind.Chuck gasped for breath and tried to figure out what to do.He grabbed as much ammunition as he could and ran after them.Jose was the first one to the top hatch.He heaved the hatch open with his left hand, while holding his gun in his right.The hatch clanged on the top of the hull.Jose popped his head out and then immediately ducked back in.The sunlight coming through the hatch was blotted out by the head of a chimera that snapped at the place Joses head had been a moment before.Jose reached out of the hatch, pointed in the direction of the chimera, and fired.He dropped his gun on the floor, and motioned for another.Jeff shoved his loaded gun into Joses hand and started loading the one on the floor.Jose strained his neck to peek out, and fired another shot out of the hatch, then ducked back in."They're everywhere!"Jose said,The blast from the gun was so loud in the confinement of the airlock that Chuck closed his eyes, and then opened them just in time to see the limp body of a chimera hanging through the hatchway.Jeff tugged on it and Chuck helped him drag it down through the hatch and out of the way.Then Chuck handed Jose a loaded gun when he motioned for it.He heard shots coming from the equipment bay below.Gavin had blocked the bay door all along the bottom with heavy crates, except for a few feet on the right side.Then they opened the door about six inches and started firing out the open slit.Two men were lying stomach down, firing out the slit as several other men handed them loaded weapons.After a few moments, the gunmen called out that it was clear, then jumped up.All the men in the bay readied their guns and then jumped out as Gavin opened the door the whole way.Chuck worked as fast as he could.After a few more minutes of furiously loading guns as they were thrust into his hands, it was all over.Chuck held up a loaded gun out of the open hatch and waited for Jose to grab it from outside on top of the hull."Thats it, Chuck," Jose said."Were done."Chuck put the gun down and finally got to breathe again.After a few moments he climbed out on top of the hull.The men below were walking around the Shark, poking through the debris.He saw about twenty to thirty chimeras lying on or around the Shark.Down on the ground, Jeff ran around the ship and saw Gavin."Did you find Sam over here?"Jeff called when Gavin looked towards him."No," Gavin answered sadly, "They must have carried him off."Jeff clenched his fist in frustration."They went that way," Gavin said, pointing over the desert floor."Lets get some men ready to go after him," Jeff said, "If Sams alive, weve got to find him fast. "2Jeff sat nervously in his seat.The onboard air tanks read zero pressure, and he hadnt been able to get a response from Gavin since Gavin had disconnected his suit from the capsule.Cliff squeezed his hand under his arm.It was numb now.Jeff sighed and relaxed in his straps and let himself float.Everything was silent.Space was always silent, but something was wrong.Jeff listened harder, and then he remembered.His helmet had stopped hissing, but he knew that he had plenty of air.He looked at the atmospheric dial on the control panel.It was almost up to normal pressure.He turned to Cliff and saw him lying in his seat, his eyes shut.Jeff gave Cliff a shove and pulled off his own helmet.Cliff opened his eyes and looked at Jeffs helmet floating past.Jeff opened his mouth and breathed."Theres air!"he said excitedly.Cliff pulled off his helmet and breathed."It's fresh air, too.""Yeah, it doesn't smell bad, like the Soyuz," Jeff replied.Cliff smiled and undid the strap around his hand.It was red and numb.Jeff disconnected his air hose from the console and floated out.Jeff looked around and saw that Gavin was floating on the other side of the bay."Gavin!"Jeff shouted, "You did it!""Now we just need to find out how many Purple Men are on this ship," Gavin said.***Grange paced around mission control.He was almost certain that the Soyuz had been lost."Vladimir, is there any way to know if they made it or not?"Grange asked."Not unless they call in," Vladimir answered."Sir," Bill called from the back of the room, "Why dont you see if the Air Force can pick out the two different ships with their telescopes?""Yeah, call up the tracking station with telescopes on Maui to try and see whats going on.They'll be over Hawaii in several hours," Grange said.***Jeff gave one last try with the capsule radio."Soyuz to control," he said and waited a few minutes for the answer."Were out of power.""Blast it!"Cliff said as he leaned in the hatch, "Weve already shut off all the other systems.Is there any way to get more juice out of the batteries?""I dont think so," Jeff sighed, "I think were going to have to figure our way out of this one on our own.""Well," Cliff mused, "I only saw one Purple Man.I bet we could take him on.""There could be thirty on board, just waiting for us to come through that hatch," Gavin said, pointing at the hatchway into the airlock."Why havent they just charged in and killed us already?"Jeff asked."Maybe theyre going to pump the air out," Cliff said.Gavin said, "Lets get out of these damaged space suits and into something that will protect us just in case they do pump out the air.""Yeah," Jeff agreed, "They should have some space suits around here somewhere.All well need to do is figure out how to get them on and working."***Grange plugged one ear with his finger so that he could hear the man on the phone better."We can't set up the big AEOS telescope that fast," the man repeated, "Plus it won't work very good in the day.""This is a matter of life and death, is there something else we could do?"Grange asked."We could try using one of the smaller scopes in the infrared," the man offered."But I don't have any official approval to give you any of the pictures.The data from these scopes is classified.""We don't have time to go through proper channels," Grange said, "I'll send you the orbital elements.""Okay," the man replied, "We'll see what we can do.""Good," Grange said and hung up the phone.He let out a deep breath and sat back in his chair with a groan.***After helping Jeff put on the helmet of the Purple Man space suit, Gavin switched on Cliff's air by punching a button on the control panel on the chest of Cliff's space suit."Now for the magnetic boots," Gavin said through an intercom in the helmet of his suit.He opened another locker on the equipment bay wall of the Purple Man ship.He held up a couple of boots and tossed them to Cliff.They glided slowly through the air and Cliff caught them."Now," Gavin explained, "You can put these boots on and they stick to the walls and floor.It helps to move around a lot faster. "Gavin pulled his boots on.***Mabok growled and opened the hatch.His base had not responded to his radio call.He climbed out of the cockpit and walked towards the bay to check for damage.He opened the airlock hatch and gasped.Someone was there!Jeff stared at Mabok for a second and then Mabok turned to run.Jeff tried to hold him around the neck and Gavin tried to grab his arms.Cliff rushed forward to help."Trall![stop!]"Mabok shouted as he tried to struggle free.The three men wrestled him against a wall."Vrommar![calm down!]"Gavin yelled.Mabok continued to struggle, but realized it was no use.He turned to look at the Reds and began to realize that he was very alone.***Gavin pushed against the wall a little, to lean closer to Jeff.The Purple Man was tied hand and foot in the corner, with a sullen look.Cliff and Jeff stood close by.They talked in hushed voices and glanced periodically in Maboks direction to make sure he didnt move."We could extract information from him in any number of ways," Jeff suggested in a whisper."I think we had better not," Cliff said, "We arent terrorists.""Cliffs right," Gavin said, "We should stick with the Geneva Convention.""They didnt stick with the Geneva Convention!"Jeff said, raising his voice above a whisper."Why does it matter what we do to this guy when he's probably killed hundreds of our people?""It matters," Gavin said slowly, "Because we still need to live with our consciences.What we do to him will change who we are.""If we die because we didnt... "Jeff started to say."Youre overreacting," Gavin said."Were not gonna die!"Cliff said emphatically, "Now let's search the ship for any others.""Yeah," Gavin agreed, "Lets move fast.""Fine," Jeff gave in, "Cliff, guard the Purple Man over here and well scout things out.""Sounds pretty good," Cliff answered, "Grab a weapon."Gavin and Jeff rummaged around and ended up grabbing a hammer and a wrench before going through the hatch.To Mabok, Kropans stories of the Reds seemed to be true.They were savages.At first, they were arguing heatedly back and forth.Then, it looked like they were going to beat him with some tools.He sighed when the Reds left the room without doing anything to him.The next room forward was empty when Jeff poked his head in the hatch.Bunks lined the walls and ceiling, but Gavins quick check of the sleeping accommodations didnt turn up anything.A few personal items were floating around, but no more Purple Men.The wedge shaped exercise room was forward of the sleeping quarters, and Gavin could see at a glance that no one was there.Jeff opened the hatch in the ceiling to find a small airlock.A short glide up a ladder through the airlock, and the two men found themselves in the cockpit.It had several chairs, lots of switches and panels, and some space to float around."Lets hope we can figure this out when the time comes," Jeff mumbled."Ive never seen a cockpit before," Gavin replied as he looked around, "They didnt let me up onto the bridge of the ship I was on.Too much of a security hazard, I guess.""Thats not encouraging," Jeff replied, "Well have to learn from scratch.""If I knew how to read," Gavin said, "It would be a lot easier to learn these controls."Jeff wrestled vainly to open the hatch in the aft wall of the cockpit and called, "Hey, how do you get this hatch open?""Pull the red handle down," Gavin answered, "Its a locking mechanism.""Right."The first room on their way back through the ship was some kind of control room.Food making equipment lined the rear wall.No one was here, either."We can make food over there," Gavin said as he pointed to the kitchen equipment."Its not too good.""I dont care right now," Jeff said, "Ill eat anything."***Cliff paced around the equipment bay getting used to the new magnetic boots.He kept his eye on the prisoner and tried to look tough.Mabok shuddered.At least the Reds hadnt shown any tendency toward cannibalism yet, like some rumors he had heard.From what Kropan said, Mabok had expected to be dead by now.***Gavin and Jeff climbed down into the equipment bay several minutes later.Cliff was glad to see them.So far there had been no sign of the enemy, but there was still more of the ship to search.The engine compartment and the outside hull would be good hiding places, and they planned to search them next."So, youre not done yet?"Cliff asked."Well look around a little more," Jeff answered, "But I want to eat first.""Yeah," Gavin said with a smile, "but I'm pretty sure that this Purple Man is the only one on board.""Once we're sure no one else is aboard," Gavin said as he motioned the men through the hatch in the ceiling, "We can start figuring out how this ship works.""That should be real fun," Cliff said as he headed toward the hatch.They carried the bound Mabok through the airlock together and then through the ceiling hatch and into a four foot crawl space above the equipment bay.The kitchen was through another hatch towards the front.Mabok was tied facing one of the control panels, with his hands behind his back.He was a little nervous that the Reds had taken him to the kitchen, thinking of the cannibal rumors.He was trying to think of how he could die nobly when he noticed out of the corner of his eye what the Reds were doing.Gavin had found some food packets and was preparing them.The food was made up of different kinds of soup.A valve on the side was used to fill them with hot water and another valve was for drinking.Mabok relaxed after noticing that they were eating food and not him."I cant believe I find myself wanting NASA food," Jeff said as he sucked on his soup packet."Well," Gavin said between swallows, "Its easy to make, and not too bad.""Mines pretty good," Cliff said with a smile."Yeah," Gavin laughed, "but you liked the Russian potato and cheese stuff yesterday, so thats not saying much.""Guys," Cliff said, turning serious, "What about the purple guy?""Yeah," Gavin said, "I'll see if he wants anything."Gavin used the hot water hose to prepare some food and then handed a warm packet of soup to Cliff."What am I supposed to do with it?"Cliff asked."Hold it up to his mouth," Gavin answered.Cliff gestured toward Mabok with the soup packet.Mabok hadnt been able to understand any of the Reds strange language, but Cliffs offering was plain enough.Maybe they weren't so bad after all.***Grange dashed towards the back of the control room and grabbed the phone from the Russian holding it out to him."Yeah?"he said into the receiver."Those spaceships you wanted me to look for?"the voice said over the phone."Yeah?"Grange said again."We have one on the scope now.I'll send you the images.""What do they look like?"Grange asked."The ship looks like it has a problem.""What do you mean?"Grange asked."There is a big sphere of gas surrounding it, and we can see a couple fragments in the area.""Go on," Grange prodded."There's lots of debris, but the large ship seems to be holding pretty steady.""Thanks for your help," Grange said into the phone, "Good bye. "Grange handed the phone to a Russian and turned to look at several men crowded around him."They can only find one ship," Grange said as he slowly walked to his desk, "Its probably the Purple Man vessel.There is no sign of the Soyuz, so they might have gotten onboard, or they could have been destroyed."***"Gavin," Jeff called as he entered the cockpit, "can you do anything about the temperature?""Im trying," Gavin said with frustration, "but I dont know what I did to make it hot in the first place.""Guys," Cliff told them as he floated into the cockpit, "we are going to have to get organized here.Everything we do, every switch we flip, we need to write down what happens so that we dont keep making mistakes.""Good idea," Gavin said."Yeah," Jeff agreed, "one time is enough with those fire extinguishers.That foam smells terrible!""Thats one switch we wont forget.""I think I still have foam in my hair."***Grange sat in the control room and twirled his pencil around his finger.All he could do now was wait for the telescopes to call in and report.The orbital track of the ship had been charted and sent to every tracking station under its path.Everything had been the same for about 24 hours.The gas cloud had dissipated, and the slowly rotating ship hadnt moved at all.He was starting to think of what to put in an official letter stating the fact that the three astronauts were probably dead.The press wouldnt like it.He didnt like it very much either.The military was still having a hard time taking the last Purple Man base in New Mexico.Total losses were mounting.The Purple Man weapons seemed to be invincible.Add to this depressing news that an attempt to capture an enemy vessel in space ended in disaster with possibly the deaths of three American astronauts, and the outlook for the country would be undeniably grim.***Maboks hands were still tied behind his back, but he was amazed at how well the Reds had been treating him.They fed him many times a day and one of them spoke to him in his language every once in a while.One of the Reds gave him sour looks and he was worried that they were just keeping him around to torture him for information.His only small moments of cheer came from watching the Reds try to figure out how to use his ship."Pull the lever!"Cliff shouted at the top of his lungs from the cockpit.Mabok floated nearby.Jeff stood in the back of the ship in the engine room, his boots securely anchored to the floor.He rubbed his hands together and yanked a metal lever on some large machinery.It slid back and clicked.Cliff looked out the cockpit window to see if the craft moved.He looked at a star in the corner of the pane.It didnt move at all."Nothing!"Cliff shouted.Figuring out the engines was turning out to be very difficult.So far, the ship hadnt even budged from the slow roll they found it in."Okay," he shouted down the floor hatch of the cockpit, "Gavin, try flipping the green switch on the big metal box at the rear of the engine compartment!"Gavin drifted through the machinery and located the big metal box.It had several metallic tubes going in and out its sides, with switches and dials on the top.It was covered in a layer of soot like the rest of the engine room.He located the green switch in the corner and flipped it with his bulky gloved finger.The three men had agreed to keep their suits on at all times just in case the air was accidentally vented into space.In fact, it had started to leak out when Jeff started turning a wheel by the airlock.He quickly turned it back, but it was still a close call."Nothing!"Gavin yelled.Then he heard Jeff yelp something above him in the engine compartment and looked up to see what was wrong.Cliff was still in the cockpit.Suddenly he was thrown from the chair and into a control panel.Now he knew what the seat belts were for.Gavin felt acceleration pulling him toward the wall.The engines must have fired.He heard Cliff yelling from the cockpit."Turn it off!"Cliff shouted.The acceleration was increasing and it was getting harder to move.Up in the cockpit, Cliff looked up to see a sack full of empty soup bags tear loose from a shelf and spill down on his head.Unfortunately, they werent completely empty.Mabok, who had bumped into the wall several feet away, with his hands still tied, had wriggled around just in time to see the scene.Cliff wasnt too happy when he noticed Mabok grinning a little at the leftover soup dripping down his face.A scowl from Cliff wiped the grin off of Maboks face.Gavin finally got to the green switch and flipped it.Jeff decided that he had had enough.He was going to make sure that before they tried this again, Gavin would try and persuade the Purple Man to tell them how to operate the ship.He didnt want to be mean, but this was just too much.Mabok floated, tied to the ladder, with the three Reds gathered around him.One of the Reds definitely looked mad and Mabok expected the worst."Tell him that we plan on going down to the planet," Jeff told Gavin.He was still pretty angry about the last mishap."If he doesnt help us fly the ship," Jeff continued, "We will crash and he will die along with us."Gavin translated it all.Mabok thought for a while.He doubted that the Reds could do anything in the ship without knowing how to use the computer.Besides, even if he did cooperate, he doubted that they would let him live after he had finished helping them."I will not help you," Mabok finally said.He tried not to think about what they were going to do to him.Cliff shrugged with frustration and Jeff rolled his eyes before they left the room.Mabok hoped that his comrades would save him before much longer.***A week had passed since the tracking stations had detected the first changes in the orbital trajectory of the Purple Man ship.Grange had been excited when he found out that the ship had moved.The astronauts might be alive after all.The ship had been changing orbits ever since.Then, this morning, the scope at Kirtland Air Force Base had failed to find the spacecraft at all.They were still looking, but so far hadnt gotten sight of it.Grange didnt know whether this was good or bad, but at least it was something different.***The weather in South Dakota was pretty good, but the four men on the Pinak didnt have time to enjoy it.Mabok was tied to a chair in the cockpit, biting his lip, while Cliff managed the cockpit controls.Jeff and was in the back of the Pinak in the engine room, and Gavin was right below the cockpit in the exercise room by some maneuvering thrusters."More lift!"Cliff shouted down to Gavin.Gavin spun a control wheel a few turns and wiped off his forehead.It was very hot in the spaceship, and he wanted to sit down, but there was no time.He had been working to fly the ship for three hours now."Left," Cliff yelled, "Left!"Jeff adjusted some valves and switches in another part of the engine room.Cliff carefully watched the terrain outside.He could make out farms and fields below."Good!"Cliff shouted encouragingly.Mabok was breathing heavily.Cliff could tell he was worried, but the Purple Man still wouldnt speak, or give any hints on how to operate the ship.Sometimes Mabok had been on the verge of yelling out some warning, but had held his tongue at the last minute.If he gave the Reds any information he was sure to be severely reprimanded by his leaders when he was rescued.So, the Reds had taught themselves.This was going to be tricky.12It only took Jeff five minutes to get his men together with bottles of water, guns and binoculars.Their ammunition was getting low.Jeff loaded two guns to take with him and left the rest with Gavin.It was warm enough now that they didnt need any jackets.Jeff set off with his men at a brisk pace across the desert.As they went out of sight Gavin could still see the dust that they stirred up as they went.After watching for a while with a worried expression, Gavin turned away and headed back to the Shark.Cliff and Javier were hauling the dead chimeras into a pile and Wes was starting up a fire nearby.Denz was cleaning out the chimeras."Gavin," Cliff called to him, "This should be enough food to last us for a while.""How are you going to preserve it?"Gavin asked."Were going to make jerky," Wes answered, "I just have to figure out the best way to cook it up."***The sun was high in the sky and blazing fiercely when the men at the Shark finally gave in and headed inside the ship to wait out the hot afternoon.Wes had been working hard on making an oven and grill out of rocks and preparing the jerky.Calvin took some of the skins of the chimeras and made a frame to tan them on.They were all worried about Sam, though.Jeff had been gone about twelve hours now to look for him, and hadnt come back with news."Everyone is in the Shark now," Cliff told Gavin on the bridge."Good," Gavin said, "Its getting way too hot out there.I dont want anyone dehydrating.""I was thinking about that," Cliff started, "Jeffs shift is still out there and they only took as much water as they could carry in those little water bottles.Plus, theyve gone twelve hours without food, and no one had breakfast before they left.""Ive been thinking about them, too," Gavin said, "but if we send anyone else out there now, they wont be any better off than Jeff and his men.We dont have big enough containers to carry the water we would need to travel for long in these dry conditions.""I think we can rig something up to carry water," Cliff said, "If we can, I think we should send some men after them at dusk."***Jeff and his men trudged over yet another ridge, but were met with disappointment at the top.There still werent any signs of Sam, just more endless dirt and scrub.They just drank the last of their water, and they were losing it quickly as sweat beaded up on their foreheads and dripped off.The chimera tracks headed down the other side of the ridge and into the valley floor below.They stumbled down the slope, following the tracks.They ignored the sand that sifted into their shoes and the dust that coated their clothes.They almost didnt care what else happened anymore, as long as they could find a cool spot to rest.Then they saw it.On the valley floor, a breathtaking panorama opened up before them.A battle had taken place here.The combatants were still lying there, frozen in the throes of the struggle.Some of them were the same chimeras that had attacked the Shark, with their distinctive red diamond pattern on their backs.The other chimeras were larger, and had blue green bands around the tips of their tails.Even after death, the jaws and claws of the chimeras were still locked onto their enemies.Two or three Diamondback chimeras lay dead around each of the fallen Blue tip chimeras, which were about twice as big.In the middle of the battlefield lay a group of adult Blue tip chimeras in a ring around some younger chimeras.Jeff and the others stumbled among the bodies in awe of the huge struggle that had taken place.They wandered in and out among the dead and searched for signs of Sam, but they could find none, and finally, they reached one edge of the battlefield and sat under bushes to rest.After a long rest, Jeff finally summoned some energy and got up off of the ground.The sun was just a little past its zenith and it was blazing hot."Lets have a look around," Jeff called as he turned to the other men.Joe and Chuck got up wearily, blinking in the bright light, but Frank just stayed on the ground."Im beat," Frank said."Okay," Jeff said, "You get some more rest.Well be back soon. "Joe wandered off in one direction.Chuck followed Jeff."Do you really think there will be anything left of Sam to find?"Chuck asked.
