The Sixth Fleet began to appear out of the blackness ahead.Its deadly columns hung suspended in front of the stars.Behind the Shark was the beautiful crystal blue sphere of home.Krid watched them come from one of the closest of the Purple Man battleships."Aim," Jeff ordered.The men turned the cannons toward the Purple Man battleships as the Shark neared them.The Shark crept closer to the enemy with a long line of pirate Pinaks trailing close behind.The pirate flagship was hanging back at the tail of the column.Silence and dread cut all of the pirates to the heart as they saw the terrible machines of destruction ahead of them.The Frigates and Gallaxeons were now so close that Joe could make out individual Purple Men inside their open gun bays.The Purple Men waited by their guns for the signal to fire.Joe stood resolutely by the cannon, waiting for his own signal."Fire!"Gavin shouted."Fire!"Jeff called."Fire!"yelled General Monterrey."Fire!"called the Purple Man Admiral.Flashes of light rippled across the rows of gun bays on the Gallaxeons as the guns opened fire.The thunder of the guns could be felt through the metal floors and walls of the battleships.Shrapnel and leaking gas exploded across the sky.The Shark shuddered violently."We lost the engines!"Frank yelled."Lets hope our momentum carries us through," Jeff murmured.The Shark continued forward, drifting through the maelstrom of cannon fire.***Still, Krid Zaffs guns were silent.Lang kept staring at him, waiting for the order to fire."Zaff," called The Admiral, "You're in the best position to take their lead ship.Remember, no prisoners alive."Krid said nothing as explosions lit up the sky around him."Shall we fire, sir?"Lang asked.Krid shook his head no."Tell my squadron to stand down," Krid said."Stand down," Lang called into the radio, and then looked at Krid in bewilderment."Do you remember the men who died for Lod," Krid asked Lang."Yes," Lang replied.He was beginning to sense something important in Krid's voice."They died fighting to protect Lod because it was their duty.He was their Liaison.They went to their deaths without knowing that they were really fighting to hide his personal crime," Krid said, his voice growing louder."How many wars have we fought for the Liaisons?How many of our men have died for the Oligarch's personal goals?We didn't want these wars, and we aren't going to fight them anymore.""This is an order, Zaff," called the Fleet Liaison over the radio, "Fire on the pirates or you will be executed.Let me talk to Lod. ""Lod's dead," Krid called back.The static on the radio accentuated the silence.Krid finally spoke."I hope this wasnt a mistake," he said softly, "but whether it was or not, my course has been set.""Captain Greggan," the Fleet Liaison called on the radio, "I want you to train your guns on Zaffs ship and fire."The only response was static."Greggan has stopped firing at the Reds," Lang said to Krid."His ships are swinging around. "Greggan's voice came over the radio."Krid, you old troublemaker," Greggan called, "What are you up to?""You don't still remember the hare brained plan we came up with in our naval training do you?""Yes," Greggan replied, "I do, but that was thirty years ago!We were much too idealistic back then.You're not going to actually do that, are you?""Just watch me."Greggan laughed."Ha, ha!I love it.Never a routine operation for you, huh Krid?"Greggan's guns remained silent."This is an order for every man in the squadrons of Zaff and Greggan," shouted the Fleet Liaison over every Purple Man's headset."We have traitors in our midst.Arrest Zaff, Greggan, and anyone else who refuses to fight for the Oligarchs!"Krid looked around at his men.They didn't move."Open fire on the traitors!"the Liaison yelled.Many of the Jaka warships began firing at the Krid's and Greggan's formations.On other ships, shots rang out as men battled furiously for control."Marka and Leck's squadrons have stopped firing," Lang said."They have joined us."Down in the gun bays of Krid's Frigate, the men were cheering."Krid!Krid!Krid!"they shouted.Their cheers were so loud that it drowned out the concussions of cannon fire striking the hull.***On board one Gallaxeon, a gunner looked up in amazement as another Gallaxeon swung into view outside his open gun bay door."Open fire on that Gallaxeon," called his commanding officer."Thats Captain Greggans ship!"cried the exasperated gunner."Thats right," replied the officer, "Hes joined that scum Krid Zaff in some kind of rebellion!"The gunner turned back to look at Greggans warship for a few moments.Then he pulled out a knife and slashed the power cord to his cannon.The nearby gunners looked in surprise at their defiant comrade."Any friend of Krid is a friend of mine," the rebellious gunner said.The other gunners pulled out their knives and followed his example.***Gavin stared in amazement at the Purple Man fleet.Many of its guns were silent, while others were being fired at each other."Whats going on?"Gavin asked Jeff."Theyre fighting with each other, just like before," Jeff mumbled.***After a few minutes, the flagship of the Sixth Fleet was now alone.Only its guns continued to fire, but it wasnt firing at the Reds, but at the rebellious warships of its own fleet."Lets go, men!"Krid shouted.His craft roared toward the flagship with its guns firing.Soon, other ships followed him.Gavin watched in confusion at Krids ship and the other warships of the Sixth Fleet as they turned on the flagship."They are fighting each other," Gavin stammered.Krid brought his ship up behind the flagship and it hovered motionless under its stern.Then men spilled out of the bay doors and scrambled onto the hull of the flagship.Soon the men disappeared inside the hull of the large Gallaxeon."Theyre attacking their own flagship," Jeff said."Hold your fire!"Gavin called on his radio."The Purple Men have turned on each other."The guns of the pirate ships fell silent.Right before the Reds began passing through the middle of the Purple Man fleet, the intercoms fell dead.Joe looked out of the bay door with wide eyes as they approached the enemy fleet.Finally, they came up beside the first Purple Man battleship.As they drifted by the ship, he saw row after row of open gun bays.In some bays, the Purple Men were struggling violently with each other.In others, the Purple Men stared back at him behind their silent guns."Why have you stopped firing?"Monterrey shouted over the radio, "Get them while we have the chance.Remember the Buccaneer!""We've lost the intercoms!"his aide yelled back."What's our contingency plan?"Monterrey just growled and pounded his fist.The two fleets continued to drift by each other in silence, except for Monterrey, who was yelling up a storm of his own.***On board the flagship, Krid finally burst through the last of the Liaison defenses and rushed onto the bridge.The Admiral and the Fleet Liaison stood on one side defiantly.Only three supporters loyal to the Oligarchs remained by them."Take their weapons," Krid commanded his soldiers as they came onto the bridge behind him.His men took the weapons."Have the fleet set a course for the Jukath," Krid commanded a technician sitting at the communications console."And get me a Pinak. "***The Red fleet had passed completely through the enemy ships and was on the other side now.Without any way to talk to each other, the pirates had just kept following the Shark until they were clear of the enemy.Then the intercoms sprang back to life."What are you doing, you imbeciles?"shouted Monterrey."Regroup!Follow me!"Monterrey's ship peeled out of the line and the other ships turned to follow him.The Shark continued to drift without any engines.Monterrey didn't seem to notice the loss of the Shark as he barked out orders to his fleet.***This time, when Krid boarded the Shark, he did so without any weapons.Gavins battered crew gathered around with their guns loaded as Krid came through the hatch."It seems as if your ship is disabled," Krid said, "Are you alright?""Yes," Gavin said, "We lost our engines during the fighting.""You have no need for guns," Krid said, "Our battle with you is over now.""But what happened?Wait.First, could you do me a favor?""What?""Could you jam our transmissions one more time?""My pleasure," Krid said with a laugh.In an instant, Monterreys shouting was drowned out by static."Thank goodness," Jeff sighed."And your fleet abandoned you?"Krid asked, "They have all retreated to low orbit.""They wont listen to me anymore," Gavin said, "And I must warn you that they may attack again.""We now have foes much more dangerous than your comrades," Krid said, "Our Oligarchs are powerful indeed.Hopefully you can return to your planet soon.""We should be able to get at least one of the engines running," Gavin said."Good," Krid said."I envy you.There's a long road ahead of us before we get home.""Are you rebelling against the Oligarchs, then?"asked Mabok."Yes," Krid said to the Purple Man."Then I want to come with you," Mabok said."If you will accept a deserter.""Yes," Krid said."Funny isn't it?Now we all are deserters.We would appreciate your help.And the Hadran too, if he wishes."The two Purple Men went and gathered their things to go with Krid.While they waited, Lang helped Sam through the hatch."Sam!"the Reds yelled."He was wounded in the fight on our Pinak," Lang said."And, I must thank him for saving my life," Krid said.Then Mabok and Denz returned ready to leave."Good bye," Gavin said before they climbed through the hatch, "I dont know if we will ever see each other again, so I wish you luck.""Thank you," the Purple Men said and then turned to leave."Remember us!"Wes shouted as they left."We will," Mabok said, turning back.He took one last look at the Reds.He stopped last to look over the faces of the three astronauts who had come so long ago to steal his ship."Ill remember my ship, too.Take good care of her while Im gone.""We will," Cliff said.***Down on the surface of the Earth, the people were ecstatic.General Monterrey had returned victorious.The papers were elated to report how the outnumbered Monterrey had attacked the Purple Men so fiercely that the enemy gave up the fight.The confused aliens had fled.They left Earth orbit and were never seen again.The whole alien fleet had gone.After several days, a parade in Monterrey's honor proudly marched through the capital of the United States.People from all over the nation gathered to watch the momentous procession pass along the boulevards.While confetti poured down from above, bands marched proudly through the streets followed by gallant lines of soldiers.Men who had participated in the battle followed in shiny automobiles.Then the hero of Planet Earth, General Monterrey, rode by in his limousine, waving proudly to the onlookers.The attention of the entire world was focused on the celebration.During all of the excitement, no one noticed a crippled spacecraft lying far outside a remote town.The Shark had come to a shuddering halt on the soil of Earth once more.After crash landing, the battered engines went out and wouldnt light again.The men on board tried to repair them again, but it was no use.***No one saw them later as they trudged slowly in a ragged procession along a dirt road.They had worn and dusty clothes made of old uniforms and hand sewn lizard skins.Gavin and Jeff walked in the front, scouting out a trail for the rest.Cliff clutched the star charts that he had labored over for so long.Sam walked along in the dust with newly fashioned crutches, a bandage marking where his leg had been.Javier walked along beside him, wiping sweat and dust from his forehead.A few circling birds were the only witnesses as Joe and Frank carried the crippled Wes on a stretcher.Wes adjusted the bandage wrapped around his head that covered a wound from the last battle.Calvin came behind them with Jose helping him stumble wearily forward and his dog Baker walking faithfully behind.These men had bandages and scars, but no medals waited for these wounded.Although fireworks lit up the skyline over Washington D. C.  and crowds cheered for General Monterrey, only an abnormal abundance of falling stars flashed through the night sky for the forgotten crew of the Shark.The debris from the battle was raining down on the Earth and creating a brilliant firework display in the stratosphere.No one cheered for the men of the Shark, but they couldnt care less.Cliff looked up at the familiar stars of home and smiled with delight.The rest of the men gazed around them with joy at their wonderful home planet.It felt so good to have the Earth under their feet again.Returning to their families was what they wanted most.Now they were finally home.When they got into town, the dusty crew rested on benches and railings by the town hall.Wes begged a little money from some startled pedestrians.He walked up to a payphone and put the coins in the slot and punched in a familiar phone number."Hello?Mom?Its me, Wes!Yeah, Im back.Well, its a long story.Ill tell you and Dad later.I know.I cant believe it either, but Im finally back.Were home. "10Jose drifted lazily at the end of his tether on top of the Shark.Every once in a while he steadied himself with his hand and looked through his binoculars to make sure no one was following them.The hatch beside him opened and Javier climbed out."Shift change," Javier said over the intercom."Great!"Jose laughed, "Im going right down and getting some supper.""Youd better stop in the left equipment bay when youre done," Javier advised, "Thats where all the fun is, but make sure Jeff doesnt find out.""Okay.""Anyone following us?""Dont look back, but that red sedan has been tailing us since Ninth Street," Jose joked."Five bucks if you lose him," Javier added with a grin."So, jokes aside, the Purple Men arent following?""Nope.Were all clear," Jose said."Great."Soon Jose was inside.He took off his helmet and went to the kitchen to have some gruel.Wes came in and started gulping some water."Whats up, Wes," Jose asked, "Youre sweating a little bit, there."Wes looked around and motioned for silence."Dont wake up Jeff, because were supposed to be working," Wes whispered, "but were having a weightless volleyball tournament in the equipment bay."Wes wiped his forehead and turned to leave."This Ive got to see," Jose said as he followed along.Wes popped the hatch into the left bay and looked around before slipping in.Jose followed and closed the hatch behind him.Jose got in a line behind Wes to wait for his turn to play.Everyone but Gavin, Cliff, Jeff, and Javier were there.Jose tapped Wes on the shoulder."Hey, Wes," he said as he watched the game, "How does this work?""Oh, man, this is awesome," Wes said, barely containing his excitement, "Three guys take the back wall, three guys take the front wall, and the object is to get the ball to touch the other teams wall.""Is there a net?""Nah," its legal to bounce it off of the floor, ceiling, bay door, or the middle bulkhead.""What about all the crates in the middle by the cannon?""You just have to try not to damage any of our equipment," Wes said nodding."Oh, yeah, and you have to serve while you are standing on your wall."Jose looked at the men, who were standing on the ceiling and walls, some upside down, others sideways.The ball ricocheted off the walls and streaked around the room.Some men took off their magnetic boots and leapt off of the walls to block shots, then tumbled around until they could steady themselves against another wall.One shot bounced off a players head into the hands of his teammate, who spiked it onto the wall between two opposing players.A cheer rang out.The winning team did high fives and did tumbles and flips in the air."Weve got to do this again," Joe said as he panted."Tomorrow when Jeff goes to sleep again," Wes said, and everyone nodded agreement.Then it was time for Wes and Jose to play and two others stepped out."You Reds know how to have a good time!"Denz chuckled.***Jeff thought that things were a little bit strange when his shift reported the next day."Frank," Jeff asked curiously, "How did you cut your face?"Frank hesitated for a little bit."I was shaving and the dog ran into me," Frank answered."Right," Jeff said sarcastically.Frank shrugged his shoulders."If you are going to horse around, just dont get hurt, okay?""Yes, sir."Joe and Sam acted like they were oblivious to the whole thing.Jeff left and then the three men on his shift grinned at each other.They had been very lucky.Jeff wasnt in a bad mood this morning like usual.They followed Jeff into the equipment bay, where they floated in a circle and Mabok joined them."Alright, men," Jeff started, "Today were going to be working on the engines.Mabok is joining our shift to give us some instructions.I hope you men have been practicing your Purple Man language skills in your free time, because Gavin is not going to be here today to translate."The men looked at each other warily because they hadnt practiced the language in their free time as much as they should have.Franks bandage attested to that."Joe will take first shift as lookout and well trade off every hour to give the others a rest from the repair work.""Right," Sam answered, "Lets go."The men grabbed tools and headed for the engine room."Kas Latten?"Frank asked, which means, "Can we eat?"It was one of his favorite phrases."Kas Latten!Kas Latten!"Frank and Sam repeated as they handed cases of tools through the hatch.Mabok just laughed to himself.***Gavin went up to the telescope dome.Cliff was floating upside down, scribbling on a large paper map.Cliff looked up and saw him."Gavin," Cliff said to greet him and then turned back to his work.Gavin waited for him to finish writing.Cliff sighed and stowed the chart on the wall."I havent been able to figure out where to go," Cliff said."I cant find any familiar stars.They must have taken us pretty far.""They couldnt have taken us that far," Gavin said, "There should be a supergiant star or something that is familiar.""Well," Cliff replied, "I can see distant galaxies that I recognize, but that only shows me what direction we are pointed.That doesnt show me where Earth is.Its as if we were somewhere on Earth with just a compass; we know which way is north, but we have no idea what part of Earth we are on without some nearby landmarks.""Well, I dont know what to suggest," Gavin said."My only guess is that we should keep moving and hope we find some better clues," Cliff said with a shrug."Ill keep trying."***"Krid," Lang called as he approached Krids bunk."What is it, Lang?""We have the spare engine assembled and installed.""Good," Krid said as he climbed out of his bunk, "How good is it?""Not as good as the original, but it works.""Then let's find them.""So, what is the plan?"Lang asked as he looked over Krids shoulder."Well, we have no idea where the Reds went, Lang."The Liaison Officer, Lod, came over next to them."So what trick do you have up your sleeve now?"he asked."Sometimes it just comes down to a lot of hard work," Krid answered as he concentrated on the screen."Now we get to really earn our pay.Set course for that star," Krid said as he pointed to a dot on the screen."Well begin a spherical search pattern.""Yes, sir."Javier tossed and turned in his bunk.He couldn't sleep.He picked up a notebook he had been using and started reading it from the beginning.He had started writing a journal shortly after ramming Krid's ship, but that was a long time ago.Javiers diary18 OctoberI decided to start writing a journal, mainly because there isnt much else to do.In our free time, we worked on learning to speak Purple Man with Denz and he showed us how to repair things around the ship.20 OctoberToday I was lookout during our shift.I had to stand up on top of the ship with binoculars.I almost froze out there and I didnt spot anything the whole day.I ended up singing songs to myself to pass the time.23 OctoberToday during our shift we practiced flying the ship again.Then Cliff had us clean up one of the equipment bays and dump out extra junk we wont need.After our shift was over we played volleyball in the bay again.25 OctoberI was lookout again today.I noticed after a couple of hours that one of the stars was very close.We flew over to it to investigate, but it had no planets, just a big disk of dust around it.I was a little disappointed.I was looking forward to landing somewhere.After that, Cliff was really frustrated.He still hasnt been able to figure out where we are.31 OctoberWe headed over to investigate another star today.It was a double star that was very pretty, but no planets.Denz cut my finger really bad today as we were working on an engine.I had to ruin my shirt to keep blood from flying everywhere.Wes was just laughing at me the whole time, so I filled up his bunk later with old food containers.3 NovemberWe saw a cool nebula today as we passed by.There were some bright stars in it, but Cliff said that there wouldnt be planets around them.I dont know how he figured that out, but thats what he said after he looked through the telescope.We had to clean up the exercise room today.7 NovemberThis week weve been studying Purple Man language a lot.Today was supposed to be "Purple Man day. "We couldnt talk in English at all, just Purple Man.It didnt work very well, though.Wes was the first to cheat and speak English because he just had to tell this funny joke and he didnt know how to say it in Purple Man.10 NovemberWe checked out another star today: nothing.The stars seem to be getting farther and farther apart, so Cliff and Gavin decided to change our course.All of the guys in Jeffs shift are really mad at each other.Something happened while they were playing volleyball in the bay.I told Frank that it wasnt something big enough to get mad about, but he wouldnt listen.Gavin said he might reassign the shifts to split them up.14 NovemberThe last couple of days, Jeffs shift was split up and our shifts were changed around a little.I had to work during the time when I used to be sleeping.It really wiped me out, but fortunately we are going back to our old shifts today.21 NovemberWeve checked out three stars in the past week and none of them had planets.Cliff told us today that hes worried about our food supply.25 NovemberToday we went on food rationing.We only get two gruel bags a day now.I just eat one in the morning and one in the afternoon, but Wes couldnt handle going that long without food, so he dilutes his two bags with water and makes three servings out of it.28 NovemberIm really getting restless lately.I cant stand this ship, day in and day out.Even Wes is a little depressed that weve been confined in here so long.Some guys got in a fight today.I think Chuck was cheating with the rations.1 DecemberWe checked out a star today.It had a couple of planets, but there was nothing on them.I would have liked to land, but Jeff and the others didnt want to waste time.Its too bad; we could spend a little time on solid ground again.4 DecemberJeff announced that we only have three weeks of food left.Thats if we go down to one and a half bags a day.Today was the first time that the thought crossed my mind that we could die out here.In our shift we practiced defending against enemy boarding parties and we had some war games.That was pretty fun.5 DecemberIf I do die out here, and someone can get this to my family, I just want them to know that it doesnt bother me too much.For my parents: thanks for teaching me and helping me out with so much stuff when I was growing up.Thanks for having patience with me.For my brothers and sisters: I hope you still go up Johnson Canyon and have barbecues, even when Im not there to bug you guys until you do it.12 DecemberWes woke me up today by spraying ice cold water in my face.In our shift today we practiced getting on our space suits quickly.I got down to one minute fourteen seconds.13 DecemberI locked the panel shut on Wess bunk today while he was sleeping inside.When he woke up, he had to yell for someone to get him out, and they didnt hear him for about half an hour.***Javier sighed, closed his notebook, and slipped on a headset to listen to what was going on around the ship."Ship sighted!"Cliff called on the intercom from outside at the lookout post."Where is it?"Gavin asked quickly over the intercom."It is orbiting the planet that we are approaching.""Everyone get to your posts!"Jeff yelled loud enough that everyone could hear.Javier jumped out of his bunk and ran to his post."Cliff, this is Gavin.Tell me what you see.""I dont think theyve seen us yet.""Well have to get ready to fly without intercoms," Jeff said."Okay, everyone," Gavin called as he took his position on the bridge, "Get on your suits and get to your posts.I want all the hatches open and get ready to lose the intercoms.""Denz, Sam, and Joe, man the cannon," Jeff called as he positioned himself in the exercise room to see Gavin in the mirror, "Cliff, can you see from up there which gun we should fire?""Lets use the right side, Jeff.Gavin, do you see it now?""I dont see it, Cliff.""Okay, Gavin," Cliff called, "Yaw about fifteen degrees to the left and down two degrees."At Gavins commands, the ship swung around.Gavin scanned out the windows."I see it now, Cliff," he said."Jeff, Im going to bring us alongside," Gavin said as he began to signal.Jeff copied his signals and the men watched him and operated the ship like clockwork.The men in the equipment bay stood next to the cannon and waited as the other ship swung into view."Its like a Pinak," Sam called from the bay, "But it looks different.""How is it different?"Gavin asked, "Its out of my view now.""It is more rounded," Sam described, "Its got kind of a mottled color.There are containers fastened to the outside.""Any movement?"Gavin asked."No lights or movement," Sam answered.Gavin waited for many minutes, waiting to see what would happen.The other ship didnt seem to be responding."Cliff," Gavin called, "Leave the lookout post and get some men ready to go over and board the ship.Ill bring us up close.""Okay, Gavin," Cliff answered."When you get on board, if anything moves," Jeff warned, "Blow it away."Gavin eased the Shark over sideways until it was a few yards from the Pinak.Cliff grabbed a gun with a gas cylinder and battery pack, and the others did the same.Denz handed around the grappling hooks.Cliff raised his arm and lowered it to signal the men to fire their hooks, which streaked out and stuck to the side of the Pinak.Soon they were drifting towards the other ship as their grappling hook motors pulled them closer.When he got close, Cliff stuck his feet out ahead of him until they stuck to the hull of the other ship.The other men did the same, detached their grappling hooks, and hung them from their belts.Cliff pulled his gun out and led the way up on top of the Pinak and along its top to a hatch.He leaned down and tried to open the hatch, but it didnt budge.Denz leaned down with him and they both heaved until the hatch cracked open."The airlock wasnt pressurized," Cliff called.He looked down inside and then looked around him."Were going in, Gavin."Cliff and Denz pushed themselves through the hatch.The airlock was dark.Cliff looked through the airlock window into the cockpit, but could see nothing."Gavin, this is Cliff.Tell someone to bring a light over.""Right, Cliff.Ill send Mabok over."The men waited in a tense darkness until Mabok handed the light down."Cliff," Jeff called, a little worried, "Tell us what is happening."***Denz turned on the light and it lit up the airlock.Denz pointed it into the cockpit and peered at the controls."The controls are strange," Denz called, "The buttons are all brittle and cracked and the letters in the inscriptions are written in a different style than Im used to."Denz opened the hatch into the cockpit.The light cast a wavering glow on the seats and windows.Cliff aimed his gun inside and stepped in.Denz followed."Were going into the cockpit.""What does it look like, Denz?"Jeff called."There are no indicator lights on in the cockpit or any other sign of life," Denz reported."All of the writing seems weird.It is like you would see in the old museums.""It reminds me of a Carvak," Mabok called from the outside."Yes, it is like a Carvak," Denz agreed."But no one has built a Carvak in five hundred years.""Check the title plate," Mabok suggested."It is the Taino," Denz reported after a little while."Ive never heard of it," Mabok called."Neither have I."Each switch and dial on the instrument panels cast a long shadow as Denz swept the cockpit with the light.To the right, a helmet was floating above one seat, attached to it by a strap.To the left there was an open storage locker with someones shoes in it.Among the buttons and gauges on the ceiling, there was a drinking bottle in a brittle cloth cover."Were heading down to the exercise room."Cliff felt a little strange in the Carvak, like he was in a museum.He gently pulled himself through the airlock into the exercise room.As Denz came inside, the light brightened up the room and they gazed on a normal looking room with personal belongings and clothing stowed on the walls and in lockers.Drinking containers and other signs of use were scattered around."Its like we just broke in on a frozen moment in time," Cliff said to himself."This may be just like they left it 500 years ago," Denz murmured."Who was it?"Gavin asked."It must have been the Tonns," Denz answered."Not even the Hadrans got out this far 500 years ago."They kept going and found themselves in the ships quarters.The bunks were arranged much differently than the men were used to.Shoes and jumpsuits were poking out of open lockers, and one bunk had its panel open and a half open sleeping bag floated inside."There are a lot of clothes and belongings lying around," Cliff commented."Yes, it looks as if they packed up all of the valuable stuff and left," Denz said."Imagine if you could see one of Columbuss ships just as it looked when he pulled into the harbor in Spain," Cliff said, "Everything exactly where it was left, and undisturbed for centuries."They drifted up into the kitchen and looked around at the old equipment and discarded utensils.Some containers were brittle and barely staying in one piece.When Cliff or Denz brushed them, they disintegrated into a shower of fragments and dust."Check for something we can eat," Cliff suggested.Denz looked through some lockers and pulled out what looked like food bags.The bags were old and brittle and the stuff inside was as hard as a rock.Denz held one up for Cliff to look at and Cliff took it in his hand and turned it over."I dont think so," Cliff said, shaking his head, although he was giving the packet some heavy consideration.The men floated back into the cockpit and Denz took another look at the ships plaque."Heres some small writing scratched into it," Denz said pointing.He held the light closer to it."Can you read it?""It says, We ventured to pass through the barrier in this ship twenty and two years after Jeshan of Bija first navigated it.It is said that Jeshan saw the Wadi after he went up from here many days.Our fuel having wasted away, we took leave of our vessel to join our brethren in the vessel Antedd to return home.It is hard to go home because we are sure that we were very close to finding the Wadi.We finally sighted the new stars that Jeshan had described."***Later, Cliff and Denz were sitting in the telescope dome as they cruised away from the strange craft.The men had sealed up the Carvak and left it where they had found it."What do you think the new stars are?"Cliff asked as he scanned the sky through the scope."I dont know," Denz answered, "I remember hearing the word Wadi.It was in an old story.""So, who are the Tonns?"Cliff asked."It's a long story," Denz said, "About a thousand years ago, the people you call Purple Men lived on the planet Jaka.It was a time of great prosperity and growth.Even though Jaka is a very cold planet, the people had created controlled habitats for themselves and most were living a life of luxury.All of the people were united under one government and were at peace with each other.The people were able to devote much time and money to space travel and built a spacecraft called a Voidann.It was capable of reaching other stars in only a short time.For several years, the people of the planet Jaka built many spaceships and sent them to nearby star systems.The Voidann was so successful that it is still used today.In fact, this Pinak here has a Voidann type engine."More than a hundred years after the exploration started, an economic collapse occurred suddenly.It was hard for the people to survive.Some could cope better than others, so there began to be a separation of the people into a rich class and a poor class.Any nonessential activities had to be canceled.So far the explorations had not found anything of commercial value and there was no profit in exploration, so the explorers were ordered home and their ships were to be sold as scrap."A man named Hadro was just a boy when the last Voidann returned to Jaka, bringing back the last of the Purple Men from outer space.He remembered hearing about the space voyages and saw some of the old spacecraft in museums and junkyards.Hadro learned all he could about the Voidann spacecraft and studied space travel all of his life.He didnt care that there was no profit in it.After he was an old man he finally succeeded in rebuilding a Voidann that could once again fly to the stars.He gathered together a group of people who were disgruntled with life on Jaka and wanted to leave.They took the Voidann into space.No one knew where they went, and they were never seen again."During this same time, the rich class had been exploiting the poorer people to get gain.They did this because they wanted to maintain their life of luxury, even though they were living in a time of economic decline.Because the government supported the rich on Jaka, many groups broke off from the Jaka government to form separate countries.The largest of these was Ramasia.The Jaka were angry with the defectors and declared war on the Ramasians.A bitter struggle followed in which the Ramasians were defeated.However, the Ramasians are a proud people.Even today they have kept alive their own cultural identity.They are stubborn and strong and the Jaka have been trying to keep them under their control ever since that time."For four hundred years, the Jaka fought with the other renegade states and sought to bring them under their domination.Finally, the Jaka emerged completely victorious and once again ruled the entire planet of Jaka."After the wars were over, the people had no purpose or vision and the economy began to stagnate once again.Corruption became rampant.A group of rich and powerful families decided that they needed to do something about the political stagnation.They rose to power to govern the planet as a council of oligarchs."All of these hundreds of years, there had been rumors that aliens had been visiting the planet Jaka and had abducted many of the people.The Oligarchs capitalized on these rumors and convinced the people that antagonistic aliens did exist.The Oligarchs started a campaign to find the aliens and destroy them to make Jaka safe.The people on Jaka believed their Oligarchs and supported them in the search for the enemy aliens.The plans of Voidann resurfaced and were used to create a new fleet of spacecraft."By strange coincidence, there were aliens nearby.They were the descendants of Hadro and his colonists.They had wandered the star systems and finally found a planet that was hospitable.Even though the planet had no oxygen, the climate was warmer and more comfortable than the planet Jaka.Most of Hadros people settled on the new planet and adapted to the conditions there.The colonists named the planet Hadra, after their leader.After a period of expansion, the Jaka found the Hadrans and started another war.They claimed jurisdiction over Hadra, even though the Hadrans had lived there and governed themselves for six hundred years."The Jaka subjugated the Hadrans, too, and made them vassals to the Oligarchs.Once again, the Oligarchs needed an enemy, so they turned to the remainder of Hadros people who had not settled on Hadra.They are called the Tonns.They are very fierce and strong willed.They live a hard life of wandering among the stars.The Tonns have traveled farther than any other spacefarers in this galaxy.Im not even sure how far they have gone."The Jaka could not defeat the Tonns because they were so far away.It took too long to reach the star systems where the Tonns roamed.The Jaka overcame that obstacle by creating the Jukath, or the Ion Course.It is much faster than the Voidann type spacecraft.The Jaka were able to build the Ion Course deep into what we call "The Tonnspace. "Then the Jaka were able to send their combat craft quickly to areas where the enemy was sighted.That is how they have been able to attack the elusive Tonns.The Tonns are still fighting against the Jaka even today.They are savage and ruthless.It takes a special kind of fighter to equal the Tonns.That is why the Sixth Fleet is made up primarily of Ramasians, who are the best fighters on the planet Jaka.I think the Jaka found your planet by accident.They were searching for the Tonns and stumbled upon it.That was most unfortunate for your people, I guess."So, you got more of a story than you wanted, I think," Denz finished."It helps explain how the Tonns got so far out here," Cliff said."Yes," Denz said, "and now you know why I am so eager to fight against the Jaka."Cliff sat in deep thought for a while, absorbing all that he had heard Denz say.Gavin came up the ladder."How long before we get to the next star?"Gavin asked Cliff."Its very close," Cliff answered, "probably half a day if we cruise at full power."After a moment, Gavin and Denz left, and Cliff was just looking through the scope by himself.The stars jiggled a little bit in his viewing lens as the ships main engines roared to life again.Gavin must have turned them back on so that they could get to this next star quickly.Soon the Shark was hurtling along.Cliff was startled when a star dimmed noticeably.The view in the scope had been brightly sprinkled with stars, except for a few dim patches.Now there were stars and clusters disappearing all over and leaving large tracts of empty black sky."How could that be?"Cliff asked himself.Javiers Diary19 DecemberWe found an abandoned ship, which seemed to be really old.That was pretty cool.Shortly after that, Cliff said that we must be going through a dark rift.That is a dark cloud of dust and gas that blocks out light from the stars.We couldnt see it before, but Cliff says that most of the stars around us have disappeared from sight.Unfortunately we are down to one gruel bag a day.Im so hungry that I just have to try to think about something else.Denz and I are making a chess set for Wess Christmas present.I just hope that he doesnt make his own before then, because hes been talking about it a lot.22 DecemberWe checked out another star today, and it did have planets, but they are all big gas giants.We didnt figure that any of them would have food, so we didnt stop anywhere.I dont see how we could find food out here anyway.Theres nothing to make food out of on any of these planets.Maybe if we had seeds or something we could grow food on the right kind of planet.We have so little food left that I dont think we have any time to wait for anything like that, though.25 DecemberFor Christmas, Jeff decided that we could have a feast.We all got to eat two gruel bags.I feel a little better, but I could have eaten five.Denz and I gave Wes his Chess set, and he was very happy to get it.Were going to start a tournament.26 DecemberI ate my last gruel bag today.The rest of the crew ran out after the feast yesterday, but Gavin decided that Cliffs shift could get the last few servings.The problem is that we have to be on duty now, because we got to eat.Well be on duty for twenty four hours straight.The rest of the guys are just lying around.I wish there was something we could do, but all we can do is wait.I cant stand to be lookout out there in the cold on an empty stomach.Cliff pulled out one gruel bag he saved and he said that the first man to sight a planet gets to eat it as a prize.Everyone volunteered to take a shift.This morning I spotted a star with a planet, so we are heading towards it.Ill eat the gruel tonight.I couldnt stand to eat it alone, so Im going to share it with Wes.Im out of paper, so Ill end my journal today.6Soon the Pinak was cruising gracefully out of the star system.In the opposite direction, the Buccaneer receded from sight as it headed back to Earth.After a day, a little white star seen out of the windows of the Pinak was quite bright and large.Gavin went up to the telescope tower and found Cliff."Cliff," Gavin said, "Start scanning for planets as soon as you can.I think we are inside the star system now.""Okay," Cliff said, "Itll take several hours.""We can wait," Gavin said."And what about the temperature?"Cliff asked, shivering "It feels like about forty degrees in here.""Im working on that.Youll just have to live with it for a while," Gavin replied.Everyone had been asking him that.***Four hours later, Cliff climbed into the cockpit with a drawing.Here you go, Gavin," he said, pointing to the paper, "I found six planets with Denz's help.These four here are crescents, so they are closer to the star than we are, and these two are beyond us.The outermost three looked like gas giants.""Alright," Gavin said, eyeing the chart, "Well set course for number three, since it probably isnt gas.How far away is it?""My calculations say that it is about a billion miles," Cliff said."The trick will be learning how to enter orbit around the planet," Gavin said."It's good that we have Denz to operate the computer for us," Cliff mumbled.Gavin nodded in agreement as the ship started vibrating from the main engines.***Cliff drowsily floated out of his bunk and went up to the cockpit.He saw Baker, Calvins dog, poke his head out of Calvins bunk.The panel was open just enough for him to get his head out.Cliff smiled and patted Bakers head as he drifted past the bunk.Baker barked and started scrambling around in the bunk until the panel slid open, and Baker drifted out.Cliff watched with amusement as Baker landed against the panel of a bunk across from Calvins and took a spill.Cliff didnt have time to stay and watch, and he headed up to the cockpit.Gavin was still there, nodding off in the chair."Hows it going, Gavin?"Cliff asked.Gavin snapped awake and looked out the top windows.He pointed up, and Cliff looked out.The planet was now a brownish disk.They were definitely getting closer."Great!"Cliff yelled."Were almost there!""Its about time," Gavin said, "Weve been trying to approach this planet for more than forty hours.Mabok could have done it in about twelve with the computer.""Lets go eat," Cliff said.Cliff started back to the kitchen when Baker floated through the bottom hatch.They watched as he flew across the room.Baker was just bouncing off the walls, but he was starting to be able to get around pretty good."Maybe," Cliff said, "Wes wont have to finish making those magnetic dog shoes.""Hes taking so long that by the time he gets them done, Baker wont need them," Gavin replied."I heard that!"said Wess voice from inside the next room.***The planet below was barren, gray brown, and heavily cratered.After two days of orbiting, Cliff had drawn a rough map of the whole planet.No water, plants, or sign of any people living there could be seen, even with the telescope.Denz was adamant that it was a fueling stop on a supply route that was regularly used by Jaka ships, which might make easy targets.After a few days, Jose called on the intercom from on top of the ship."Somethings moving over there!"he called excitedly."Where?"Gavin asked.Jose paused, "Five three four and three sixteen," he finally said."Cliff!"Jeff yelled, "Get a look at it with the telescope!""Right!"Cliff answered and headed to the telescope tower.Cliff put his star map aside and swung the scope around with the high pitched whine of motors.Soon he was looking at the right coordinates.He wobbled the scope back and forth until he spotted the object.It was long and bright.Cliff recognized the protrusion on the back of the object as a telescope tower."Its a ship!"he yelled."Looks just like ours!
