Jak: So I just realised.Just tell me what it looks like.Sai ias: You didnt like my description?I tried so very hard.Jak: It was indeed lovely.Just tell me: dimensions, shape, does it have black sails that catch dark matter and drive it onwards             through space?Sai ias: It is indeed very large, and it is shaped like a Bugong, you know, the flying creature they have on the planet of the Farla,             and yes it does have black sails, and the hull is marked with a single three dimensional spiral shape known by many species             as a helicoid.Jak: Thats the Death Ship.Sai ias: We call it Hell Ship.It comes from a universe where the substance some call mysterious cosmic stuff is part of the fabric             of the stars, and of every iotum, and it gives the Kaun a power that many species describe as magic.Jak: And you?Why do you serve Minos?Do you do so voluntarily?Sai ias: Am I your enemy, do you mean?Am I one of them?Jak: Yes.Sai ias: No.Jak: What then?Sai ias: Slave, I suppose you would say.Or warrior.But know this: I have served the Kaun, I have done their bidding, but only in order to deceive.In the hope of finding a way to defeat them.And as a consequence, I was able to acquire this radio             to get in touch with the Kauns enemies.Jak: I understand.Sai ias: I am not a traitor; do not say I am!Jak: I didnt say that you were.Sai ias: It is hard for me.Painfully hard.Jak: I understand.Do you Explorer 410: This is Explorer 410 once more; describe the universe where you were born, and which the creatures you call Kaun destroyed.Jak: Well you really cut in on the poor creatures grief there, spaceship.Explorer 410: This is important, we may not have much time.Describe it.Sai ias: Describe a universe?How can that be done?Explorer 410: Describe your world and your people then.Sai ias: We were born many millions of years ago on a planet called Hasha.We lived in the sea and we were slaves of a more powerful             sea dwelling creature, the Tula.But we evolved and took to the land, then flew in the air, then flew to our moon and lived             there.We can live in regions where there is no atmosphere, our body contains vast reserves of breathable air and we can expand             our shapes a hundredfold, or even a thousandfold.And that is how we flew between the stars.Vast flocks of us, for we live long lives and our bodies are resilient and strong,             from all those aeons spent living on the ocean bed where vents spat volcanic rock and boiling sea at us daily.Jak: Thatswhoah.Oh.Sorry, ignore me.Explorer 410: Your people befriended many species, you did not invade or conquer or seize their land.You merely landed, like angels descending             from the sky, and helped and taught and saved many a civilisation from self destruction by preaching peace and amity and love.Sai ias: Yes.But how do you know this?Explorer 410: A message was inscribed in the reality ripple of riftspace by one of the civilisations you encountered.They wrote of you             with love and awe, they thought you were gods.But when their planet was attacked, they blamed you, they thought that you             were demons sent as harbingers of doom.And they died cursing you, but if you read the accounts carefully its clear you were             innocent parties.Sai ias: Oh.We were not gods; nor were we demons.Nor were we warriors.We did not fight; to do so ran counter to our philosophy of life.Except that, since then, I have often fought and frequently killed.And according to the morals of my kind, that means I have             lost soul.It is a hard burden to bear.Explorer 410: Leave the signal path open, please.Sai ias: I cannot talk any more.Explorer 410: Leave the signal path open, send a message every day, at least once a day.Just say Here.And Here, every day, from now             until you die.And that way we will know where you are.We can track you through universes and find you on board the Death             Ship.And then we will destroy the ship, and you with it.Sai ias: There are tens of thousands like me on the ship.Will you kill us all, even though we are innocent, just to destroy the Kaun?Jak/Explorer 410: Yes.Sai ias: So be it.Explorer 410: Sai ias, we have lost you.Sai ias, transmit please.Jak: Its been a month.Why doesnt she answer?Explorer 410: We must persist.Jak: They must have found her out.Explorer 410: We dont know that.Jak: If they discovered what shes done, her life will be a living torment.Theyll torture her.Theyll Explorer 410: It may be just a bad signal.Jak: Shes risking everything for us.Explorer 410: For herself.And for all her kind.Revenge is the motive common to all those engaged in this enterprise.Jak: You too?Explorer 410: Oh yes.Jak: You hate the Kaun?You want revenge on them?Explorer 410: Oh yes.Jak: But how can that be?Youre just a machine.Explorer 410: How little you know me.Jak: Youre not just a machine?Explorer 410: No.Jak: Ah.So you have feelings, emotions, just like me?Explorer 410: Yes.Jak: I didnt realise.Explorer 410: Im aware that you did not realise.For how could you know?After all these millennia yoked together in a single body, how could you have realised that I can be hurt, humiliated,             enraged, patronised, belittled, undermined and sad?How likely is it that such a thought would have drifted across your selfish, self obsessed mind?I grieve too!You have lost your people, but I have lost my people also.And I mourn them all!All the other seven thousand Explorer ships             with their roving questioning minds.And the battlecruiser brains, with their bullying swaggering arrogance, but oh how glorious             they were.The planetary robot mindssuch smart, kind creaturesthey sustained your entire civilisation by doing all the menial work and running all the factories.And what thanks did they get?You treated them like slaves.You treated them like the Kaun treat their creatures on the Hell             Ship!Jak: Im sorry.I had no idea.Oh by the love of my mother, I had no idea!Explorer 410: * ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha * Jak: Youre laughing.Explorer 410: I am indeed laughing.Jak: Why are you laughing?Explorer 410: At you.The way you fell for it.Jak: Fell for what?Ah.You ARE just a machine.Explorer 410: I am indeed just a machine.Jak: You dont have emotions.Explorer 410: How could I have emotions?Im a piece of software.I have sentience, and rationality, but emotions are not part of my original             build.Jak: So you were lying to me?Explorer 410: Entirely.I dont care about revenge.I dont mourn the death of my fellow computers and robot brains.I am not your friend.I am just a machine.Jak: So why did you tell all those lies?Explorer 410: I dont have emotions, but I do have a sense of humour.Its one of my subroutines.Jak: Ah.Explorer 410: Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias, this is Explorer 410, please acknowledge.Sai ias: Im here.Jak: Youre safe!Sai ias: Im safe.Explorer 410: For three whole months, I have had no way of tracking your position.Sai ias: I could not get any signal; perhaps because we changed universes.Which as I now know is what happens when the strangeness             descends upon us.Explorer 410: Youre in a new universe?How?It is not possible.For this time I have left a robot clone of myself at the Source and Jak: They must have found another way to rift to a new universe.Perhaps they can Sai ias: I dont know youre talking about!All I know is that we destroyed many worlds in this reality but then the Kaun decided             to kill no more.So the strangeness came upon us, and Minos told me we had switched universes by Summoning the Origin of Everything.And here we are.And when we left, the stars behind us did not go out; the universe remained intact.There must be some reason             for it, but I dont know what.Explorer 410: A test?Jak: More likely a whim.Explorer 410: Or perhaps, a test.Perhaps the Kaun investigate all the sentient species in a given reality and make a decision whether             their universe deserve to live or not.Jak: No!Thats not possible!Explorer 410: My data indicates it is behaviour consistent with a certain variety of psychopathic mind set.Jak: I cant accept that!That they judged my people and found our entire universe wanting?No!Sai ias: Youre doing this thing again, where you talk to each other and I hear only one voice.It makes you appear singularly mad.Explorer 410: We have to start again.Return to the Source, re enter the void, and locate you in your new universe.Jak: That could take years.Explorer 410: Two point four years, if we rift skilfully, and assuming the Source has not shifted its relative location since our last encounter.Five point seven years if, as I suspect, the Dreaded have learned how to summon the Source to their own location and we             have to find it from scratch.Six point nine years if           Jak: Enough!Its not as if we have a choice.Just do it.Sai ias: Can you still hear me?Jak/Explorer: Yes.Sai ias: I feel very isolated.I have no friends now.The slaves in the exterior world despise me and hate me for the freedom I enjoy.And whenever I see them, my friends on the interior world think I am a traitor.And I have to continue to pretend to             be so.Otherwise I could not speak to you.But I am hated by all, and its breaking my soul.Hello?Did you hear any of that?Explorer 410: I heard your words, but since the content was about emotion and I am just a machine, I was pausing to allow Master of the Ship             Jak to respond.Jak: Ium.I acknowledge your pain.Sai ias: Have you ever felt like this?Lonely?Unhappy?Unloved?Jak: Lonely, yes!And unhappy, certainly.Ive been unhappy ever since I was trapped in the body of a Class 4 Explorer ship, and             forced to co exist with a machine who possesses a sad apology for a sense of humour, yes.Explorer 410: If I were capable of emotions, I would resent those words.Sai ias: I am used to being loved.I find it hard to live without love.Jak: Ah, well there you have me, for Ive never been loved.Sai ias: What?Jak: Ive never been loved.Males are never loved.Thats just the way things are.Sai ias: You cant mean that, Jak?Jak: Well there are exceptions but even so, thats pretty much how it is.There was one female in particularperhaps she????but I will never know.Generally however that is the way of my kind; love is a river that flows only one way.Sai ias: Thats sad.Jak: Hardly.Its just a cultural difference.Sai ias: Such differences can be considerable.One of my dearest friends comes from a culture where mothers eat their own new born.Jak: There, you see, by comparison wewhat?Explorer 410: The Frayskind.Theyre in my database.It is just their way.Many aquatics do it too.Sai ias: My own kind mate for life.I know many species who do not.Promiscuous, polyamorous, feckless and recklessI know some beasts             who have had sex with literally tens of thousands of partners.The serpentiforms are the worst.Though some of the birds are             pretty bad.The larger creatures, though, tend to be monogamous, like me.Or rather, as I would have been; had I not been             a child when the Kaun captured me.Jak: You were a child?Sai ias: Oh yes.Jak: I am so sorry.That must have been Sai ias: At least I lived.Jak: You poor thing.How many years have Sai ias: Many.Jak: I am sorry.Sai ias: Is it really true you have never been loved?Jak: I dont know.Sai ias: How dont you know?Jak: Becausewell.Star Seeker Albinia and I were justI was sure she did actually love me.But she never said so.And I always feared that, well.I feared that she would suddenly change her mind, and forget her love for me.Like all the             other females in my life had done.Thats howthats whyI spent all our time together expecting the worst.Which means of course I found it hard to actually             enjoy her company!Because I kept imagining she might say: Oh dear, this isnt working out Jak.Or, Jak, I no longer care             for you.Or, Jak, you hopeless and sexually inept fool, Ive only been pretending to like you, actually I think youre a             badly dressed laughing stock.She never ACTUALLY said any of those things; but I imagined it all so often it felt as if it had happened.I was being stupid, I know!Unfair on her.It may be she would have been loyal, and we could have lived happily together for             twenty years or so; perhaps she really was the one.But before I had a chance to find out, one way or anothershe died.Right in front of me.The Death Ship killed her.SoI will never know.Explorer 410: None of this is at all relevant to our plight; I thought I should register that observation.Sai ias: Why so afraid, Jak?You cant spend your life being afraid of being betrayed.Jak: In my culture, its an occupational hazard.It is our duty to serve, and to give our females pleasure both social and sexual,             and gain little or none in return.Sai ias: But thats pathetic.Jak: We males consider it to be ennobling.Explorer 410: Speaking as an impartial observer, and taking into account that I am not capable of ANY emotions, let alone love, I too Jak             find that pathetic.Jak: It is the way things are, and have always been.Sai ias: Perhaps we mean something different by the word love.Jak: Our females fuck us, but they dont give us orgasms, and they treat us like shit.Sai ias: By the standards of my culture, that means you dont get loved.Oh you sad thing!Jak: I dont need your pity!I am a proud Olaran.Sai ias: Yes I know.I know.I didnt mean totell me about yourself Jak.Describe yourself.I would like to know you more.Jak: Why?Sai ias: If I know you, I might be able to love you; for my kind are capable of unconditional and limitless love, when we truly know             a fellow creature.But all I know of you so far isa voice from a machine.Jak: Um, perhaps we should keep focused on the mission?Sai ias: How many limbs do you have?Jak: You have no idea how ridiculous that question sounds.Sai ias: True.Because I have no sense of humour, as I have been told on many occasions.Ill go first: I have twenty four limbs.Twelve             feet, not in pairs.Ten hands, or strictly speaking, tentacles.And two filaments that come out of my mouth that can be used             to manipulate objects, and which therefore count as limbs.Does that help you visualise me?Jak: Tentacles.By the God of all the Traders, you are a monstrous beast!Sai ias: How many limbs do you have?Jak: I have simply the normal number.Four!Two arms.Two legs.Two eyes.Two penises.Im an Olaran.Sai ias: Ah, a biped.Do you have scales or fur?Jak: Skin.You?Sai ias: Chitinous armour enveloped in soft hide.Do you have wings?Jak: No.You?Sai ias: I have a cape which allows me to fly.I can also dwell in the water.Now you can see me.Jak: Now I can see you.Sai ias, are you beautiful?Sai ias: Many consider me so.Some, not so much.And you?Jak: I am very beautiful; or rather, I was.I was a gorgeous youth who became a beautiful man; females used to flatter me; I dressed             in ornate and beautiful gowns and my body was lean and perfectly proportioned.Now I am a wreck; my body was burned and what             survived was destroyed by Explorer and flushed out of the waste disposal.I am now more spaceship than Olaran; my brain lives             in fluid connected by cables to this computers mind.Sai ias: I will imagine you in your beautiful body.Do you love children?Jak: I have no children of my own, but I adore them.You?Sai ias: I was a child when I came to this place; I would love to have been a mother.It seems we have much in common.Jak: We have very little in common, except not having children.Sai ias: We should be friends.Jak: I wouldlike that.Sai ias: I am here.Jak: Its been a year since we last spoke.Sai ias: It has been sixty eleven day cycles by my calendar.It has been a most terrible sixty cycles.Jak: We are tracking you again.We are at the Source, and have been waiting here for the last nine months by our calendar, but             with no trace of the Death Ship.Now we have your signal again, we can start rifting between universes and we can find you,             wherever you are.Keep giving us your location.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Sai ias: I am here.Jak: We have a proximate trace on you.Sai ias: You are in the same universe as me again?Jak: Yes we are.Sai ias: Please.Hurry.I cantnot for much longer.Explorer 410: It wont take that long.Keep talking.If there is a pause, we are rifting through real space, which is faster but cuts the             riftband link.Sai ias: Im still here.Jak: Weve travelled through many universes.Theres a trail of dead sentience smeared through the spaces.Shall I tell you about             the worlds we know about, that are lost?Sai ias: No.Jak: Shall I tell you then about  Jak: Sai ias?Are you there?Sai ias, are you there?Sai ias, are you there?Sai ias Sai ias: Im here.The signal wasI switched it off.I couldnt listen any more.Im sorry.Jak: Its all right.I understand.Sai ias: Do you?Jak: I do.Sai ias: I think perhaps you do.Thank you, Jak, for understanding.Jak: Shall I tell you instead then about my adventures?The days of my youth?Sai ias: No.Jak: Then talk to me of yourself.Your world.What it was like.Sai ias: No.Jak: Something bad has happened.Sai ias: Yes.Jak: Do you wish to tell me about it?Sai ias: No.Jak: An atrocity?Sai ias: The latest of many.The Kaun truly trust me now.They think I am one of them.Jak: Ah.Sai ias: I think it may be true.I am indeed like them.Jak: No.Not so!Youre merely pretending.Sai ias: Indeed, that is what I do.Jak: And tell medo you still speak to the Kaun?Sai ias: Yes I do.I hear a voice in my head and speak back to it.Though not every day, not any more.The voice of Minos, captain             of the ship.Jak: Minos.I know that name!Minos wasWhat is he like, this Minos?Sai ias: Charming.Cultured.Kind.A liar.Jak: Why dont you kill him?Can you do that?Are you strong enough?Sai ias: Strong enough, yes.But I cannot.I have only seen Minos in the flesh once.Otherwise, he is a voice in my head.I do not             know how to reach their part of the ship.I never see them, only hear them.And even if I could get near Minos, he has a power             over me; he could take control of my body in an instant.Jak: Then we shall kill him for you.Sai ias: I wish you would.Before Jak: Before what?Sai ias: Before I become truly evil.Sai ias: Im here.Jak: Sai ias.Sai ias: Im here.Jak: Sai ias!Can you talk awhile?Sai ias: I do not wish to talk.Sai ias: Im here.Jak: Sai ias.Sai ias: Are you near?Jak: Its hard to say what near is.Yes.I think we are near.Sai ias: What will you do?When you find us?Explorer 410: We have weapons that will destroy your ship in a single panoramic blast; thus compensating for any possible illusory image             tricks of the kind that deceived us last time.Sai ias: You will kill me too.Jak: Yes.Sai ias: Good.Sai ias: Im here.Jak: We are close to you Sai ias.Weve just emerged from rift space.Our sensors detect the ship with the black sails.We are             stealthed and ready for combat.We are ready to fire.We are firing now.Our missiles are being launched, they are rifting,             and now they are materialising again.The Hell Ship does not a stand a chance this time!Oh Sai ias, I will always           Sai ias: Jak?Explorer?Where are you?Minos: Sweet Sai ias; a nicely baited trap.Sharrock For nearly a hundred years I have endured pain beyond anything I would have believed possible.And I have not faltered, or          faded, or succumbed to the fatal state that is known as Despair.And I have always clung to this small consolation; they have not crushed my spirit.They have defeated me, humiliated me,          tortured me, and left me with no prospect of hope.But my spirit remains intact.It is, indeed, a very small consolation.It would, I know, be so much easier to yield to utter desolation; and let the toxins steal over my body, and turn my flesh          into stone.The Kaun have spread the myth that death is not possible, even when the body is petrified; but I do not believe          this.I believe that when I die I will be dead and I will achieve merciful oblivion.However, I do not wish to give those forsaken by the gods fucking bastards the satisfaction.So every day they hose salt water upon my flayed skin; and plunge knives into my body; and lash me with a knotted rope.After          a few hours the pain is so bad that I become blind, through some kind of hysterical reaction, but the torment does not cease.They use members of the Kindred to torture me; it is clearly one of their tiresome but necessary allotted duties.There are          few things worse for me than seeing the look of boredom on the face of my torturer before the first knife is thrust into my          gut.Then every night the ceiling rains healing water upon my body and the wounds seal and my organs reform and my vision is restored and by the morning I am whole again, and the rhythm          can begin anew.To distract myself I write poems in my head.I have never had much flair for poetry; and in all honesty, I suspect I still          do not.But I have written 10,000,000 cantos or more of an epic poem about my adventures, and there is no one here who can          tell me that it is less than a work of genius.Ha!You see, even in the midst of utter agony, I have not lost my sense of humour.Sharrock defeated?Never!Oh I am so weary.I awoke, and felt that something was different.My agony was no less; my torturers were as bored as always.But the magnetic bonds that hold me aloft felt soft, and spongy.Once my torturers had completed their daily chores and departed, I realised I could now bounce upon my invisible bonds, to          get some movement going.And furthermore, I could manipulate my hands inside their metal shackles, which were looser than          before.And so I wriggled and struggled, and used my teeth to grip the shackles while I moved my wrists; until finally I was          free.It was an far easier job to slip free of my ankle shackles.I was still trapped in a cell the size of a desert tent, but I          was no longer restrained.There was an electronic lock on the door; and I began to manipulate it with my body energy; touching it with fingers and licking          with my tongue to move the inner parts with the power of my own electricity.This is the trick I used in Sabol, the capital          city of the Southern Tribes, to steal their precious alien artefact, the Jewel of the Seventh Sun (a jewel that is now possessed by a black hided sea monster who I am proud to call my friend).Finally the lock opened, and I was through the door.I was nakednay, flayed, my muscles were visible and knotted, the slightest          touch or brush against a wall was agony for me.But I did not allow this to distract me.I found myself in a silver corridor, and I placed my ear to the metal and I listened.It took a long time for the sounds to make themselves manifest; but eventually I was able to hear the murmur of conversation          between the Kaun and their Kindred slaves.I started to distinguish voices.I could identify twenty five distinct individuals.But the words they uttered were gibberish, for I no longer had a pakla translator in my brain.I also heard the faintest noise, the merest hint of a vibration, that sounded to me like water flowing; I deduced it was the          twin rivers that ran through the interior world.Four layers of hull separated me from my friends; but at least I could hear          the sounds of their world.And I was unbound, and had a vivid mental map of my location and where my enemies were.I continued down the corridor until I heard footsteps and the whisper of blood through veins, which betokened enemies approaching.And I clambered up the wall and clung to the ceiling with my fingertips, which though fleshless still retained some magnetic electric          adhesive power.And I waited.Twenty long minutes passed and eventually two burly bipeds strode down the corridor; giants          with square heads carrying energy guns in their hands.These were two of my Kindred captors, on their way to torture me.It          must be dawn, I realised, though the lighting in the corridor had not changed.The Kindred were big and muscular beasts, used to hand to hand combat; and I was weary and flayed and I knew I stood no chance          against them in a fair fight.However, the moment they had walked past I dropped down behind them and seized first one head, then the other, and snapped the necks of both.I was not as strong as once I was, but          I was still exceedingly fast.The two Kindred fell and rolled and immediately got up again, their necks twisted out of shape but rage leering in their features.And I realised that a broken neck was no obstacle to these creatures.And they reached for their energy guns, only to find I had ripped them from their belts.I had a gun in each hand; I did not          hesitate; I fired flame; they died before they were able to scream.I found I was shivering and shuddering; my flayed skin was causing me pain, and it was reacting badly with the air.Underneath          the jets of healing water I was strong; but in cold air, I was a walking cripple.I stripped the clothes off one of the Kindred, recoiling at his ugly body hair, and carried the garments back to my cell.The healing waters still flowed; so I soaked the clothes, then put them on my body.The sleeves of the shirt were ridiculously          long so I rolled them up; I tucked the trousers in the boots.I was now dressed all in black, wearing clothes far too large          for me, and I looked absurd.But the healing dampness of the water from the well of life was now pressed up against my raw          skinless flesh.I stepped back out into the corridor, and sprinted as fast as I could away from my confining cell.Once the alarm was sounded          they would send all their troops against me.I emerged out of the silver corridor into a maze of metal; walkways and flyboards hovered in the air, and the low hum of machinery          and computing machines created a music in my ear.I listened again to a wall, until I could identify where the Kaun dwelled.It was far from me; I was safe for now.But all          around me the sounds of machinery told me that I was in the nerve centre of their outer hull universe.I went through four doors by opening their electronic locks with the energy from my bodys cells, until I found myself in          a room with a large dome floating inside.I recognised this as a Machine Mind.I had no idea what to do; and I wondered if the Machine Mind was designed to function in response to the thought patterns          of a member of the Kaun.I thought about destroying it, but I worried that would simply wreck the ship, and thus kill my          friends in the interior world.I returned, back down the corridors through which I had fled, towards the place where Id killed the two Kindred.I was three          corridors away when I heard the murmur of voices; reinforcements had arrived.The alarm had been sounded.The Kindred were          hunting for me.Once more I climbed the walls then slid along the ceiling the length of two corridors until I was above the Kindred sent to          kill me.There were six of them, and they gathered around the two corpses I had left, barking gibberish to themselves; I guessed          they were connected to others of the Kindred by brain paklas.I fell from the ceiling and began firing energy beams from my stolen guns.The Kindred were slow, and all of them burned and          died before they managed to assimilate what was happening.I was now in a corridor surrounded by Kindred corpses.I frisked one of the bodies until I found a dagger; then I dug the          blade into the corpses skull.I opened up the brain until I found the crystal pakla.Then I cut it out.And I returned back down the corridors, up the stairs, into the metal maze, until I was back in the room with the Machine          Mind.The pakla in my hand began to glow; and as it did so, a display lit up in the air around the Machine Mind.I touched it with          my hand, and I felt the flow of data energy swirling within the Machine Mind.This, I was confident, was the part of the Mind          that controlled the brain paklas.I raised my energy gun and reduced the beam to its narrowest; and burned away that part of the Machine Mind.When the pakla stopped glowing, I stopped firing.I prayed that I had not caused any ancillary damage.I left the room.I could hear, from two corridors away, the voice of one of the Kaun leading a gang of Kindred, presumably          to find and kill me.I thought about lingering to destroy my enemy but decided the risk was too great.I used the energy gun to cut a hole in the ceiling above me.Then I leaped up in the air and clambered through the gap.I did this eleven times until I could scent the air of the interior world.I clambered through burned metal and found myself in the open air.I pulled myself through.I was in a green field; I had cut my way through into the interior world.I lay there on the ground for a while, gasping, entirely exhausted.And then, to my astonishment, I saw the hole that I had carved in the hull begin to seal itself.The severed ends yearned          towards each other; then touched; and eventually bare metal fully enclosed the gap.I absorbed the implications of this phenomenon; this must be one of the reasons the Kaun ship had survived so many battles,          since the metal hull could heal itself.But the process had, however, been rather slow.My thoughts began to stir.I knew that my enemies would be pursuing me; so I dragged myself to my feet, and began to limp slowly across the grass, towards          the lake, where I knew my fellow slaves would be congregated.I knewfor I have always kept a constant mental tallythat this was Day the Eighth, and all would be gathered there to tell          their tales.I was tired, and parched, and desperate; my vision swam; I was shivering and shuddering and my clothes were no longer damp,          so I stripped them off and staggered onwards naked.Finally I glimpsed the waters of the lake; and on the further shore, I saw my friends gathered.But I was nowhere near them; I had misjudged the route.This had never happened to me beforemy          mental mapping is usually infallibleand this was when I realised my brain was shutting down.I dragged myself along the grass to the waters of the lake, leaving a trail of red behind me.And I tried to call out across          the waters of the lake to my fellow captives; but it was too far away, and no sounds emerged from my throat.My strength was failing me.I fell to my knees.I dragged myself along the grass, trying to reach the soft blue water.I was          dying, I realised, and I needed a drink before I died.A drink.A                      Hell Ship           Sai ias After the death of Explorer and Jakin what I guessed would have been a massive explosion in space caused by MinosI had returned          to the interior world.Minos no longer spoke to me in my head.I understood by now that from the moment he intercepted my first radio signal, Minos had deceived me utterly and flawlessly.I had lured Explorer onwards; and Minos allowed me to do so; time and again letting me roam free in the rooms of the exterior          hull in order to make my radio calls.Then he destroyed the ship he called Nemesis, and Jak with it.It had been a plan carefully          nurtured; Minos had allowed me to befriend Jak, so he could slay him.I no longer had any hope left.My former friends hated me; and many of them like Fray had no memory of our good times together.They only ever knew me when I was masquerading as the evil bitch who freely served the Kaun.I knew that by this stage no one would ever believe that my actions had all been a pretence, in pursuit of my plan to overthrow          the Kaun.For that plan of course had now failed.The pretence had turned out to be the reality; I had simply been deceiving          myself.Thus I was left with nothing.Then one day I felt a flutter of wings near my head, and saw Lirilla.Sai ias, she said.Yes?I said.Lirilla no longer considered herself my friend, after witnessing me vanquish and humiliate the Krakzios; but          she was at least speaking to me.Sharrock back, dead, she said, and flew away.I was consumed with fear at her words.I began to lope with my tentacles; I saw crowds near the lake, and hurried towards them.And I saw a muscular body lying there.It took me a moment, but then I recognised it as Sharrock.He was damp, possibly drowned,          and had been flayed.His eyes stared blankly from his fleshless face.Fray saw me and growled in her throat.But I ignored her, and pushed my way through.And I touched Sharrock with a tentacle          tip and felt his pulse, and there was none.So I thrust my tentacle tip down his throat until it was nearly in his gut, and then wrenched it out.He vomited water and          he began to breathe once again.I lifted him up, and carried him swiftly on my back to the well of the water of life and laid him down there.He slept there          for an hour, and emerged spluttering.The new born Fray and my former friend Quipu gathered with me, as I looked down upon Sharrock.Will you take him back?said Quipu One.I stared at him blankly, not comprehending.He has escaped, Quipu Two clarified.Surely it is your job to betray us once more.I shuddered with shame at his words; though I did not blame him for uttering them.Who is he?asked Fray, staring with puzzlement at the naked, flayed Maxolun.Oh Fray, said Quipu One.If only you knew!Your previous self followed this one to glorious defeat and death.Sharrock          ishe was        He tried to destroy the Kaun; he failed, I said.Hes awake, said Quipu Four.Sharrock was indeed awake; and looked up at us.And he spoke.But his words were a babble; we could not understand him.How?I cried.Surely we should still understand him?My guess is that the Kaun have deleted his language from our paklas, said Quipu One.Paklas?asked Fray, baffled.Sharrock whimpered with frustration at our inability to understand him.He pointed, to his head; then he stood up and touched          the heads of Quipu.We stared at him blankly.Sharrock roared with rage.Never had I seen him so helpless, so frustrated; nor so wretchedly vulnerable, stripped as he was          of all skin.But then Sharrock paused, and was clearly lost in thought.Then he stood up tall.And he no longer looked defeated; he looked like a warrior about to go into battle.And what then followed was theatre, as Quipu later called it, of the magnificently absurd; a mime show that spoke louder than          words.We saw Sharrock, bound and tortured; we saw Sharrock fighting with his bonds; then Sharrock free; Sharrock running down a          corridor; and finally, Sharrock destroying something, we knew not what.At the end of it all, Sharrock took up a tree branch and he thrust it into my middle segment.Hard.And again.And again.I did not move or recoil, I was trying to fathom his meaning.Finally my body spasmed and a deadly quill emerged from my middle segment; Sharrock had seen me do this in the battle against          Cuzco.Sharrock then touched my quill with his flayed hands and pointed to the heavens; then mimed a penetrating thrust.Eventually, I understood.Later that day I told my tale to Quipu and Fray; the story of my long and ultimately futile deception of Minos.I talked of          Star Seeker Jak and his failed attempt to destroy the Hell Ship.He tried for so many thousands of years to take revengeand then died in just a moment, I said.This story said Quipu One.could just be another lie, said Quipu Two.Trust me or not, I dont care, I said.There is about to be a war; prepare yourself for it.And then I told them what Sharrock wanted me to do.Is it possible?said Quipu One after I had finished my account.Sharrock knows my powers, I said.He knows the powers of all of you.He has studied us all and he has planned; and it is          the best plan any of us have yet conceived.In short, we have a chance, I said.Minos is no longer in my head; and I know from this that the pakla link has been broken,          for that evil bastard loves to haunt me and to spy on me.He thinks I do not know he is there; but I can always tell.But now Minos has gone; my mind is truly my own again; and this Sharrock has achieved.Now, the rest is up to us.I made my way down to the cargo bay, where the hull hatch was located.Many times we had toppled stone corpses out through          this gateway to the stars.But today we had another purpose in mind.I squeezed myself into the hatchway, and Quipu manipulated the controls.An outer door opened, and I squeezed through; an          inner door then closed, protecting the air in the cargo hold from the emptiness of space.Then the outer door opened too and I fell out and was among stars.Below me the Hell Ship floated, huge and beautiful and black sailed.It was a cylinder of a vessel, elegantly curved, culminating          in a triangle tip, and dazzlingly illuminated with lights buried in the metal.But the hull looked old now, and was coated          with strange growths, like living beasts; save for a large patch of clear metal which I recognised as the spot where Explorer          410: Property of the Olaran Trader Fleet had sent a missile into the hull.I unfurled my cape to its fullest extent, and hurled an ear frond at the ship until it touched metal and connected; and so          I was now being pulled along with the Hell Ship on its effortlessly swift course through space.I thought about Minos, and all that he had told me of himself.How much of it was true?I wondered.I knew of course that          he had lied to me about many things.But had there been any honesty at all in his words?Did he ever actually have qualms          about what he and his evil crew had done?I doubted it.Whatever he had once been, Minos was now simply malign: beyond remorse and compassion, hate incarnate.I longed          to kill him.And so I would.I fired air from my gills, and flew closer to the Hell Ship.Then I clung to the hull with my body, gripping with my claws, embracing it like a bird smothering its prey.And with a powerful jolt, I buried my centre quill in the hull.It dug in deepI felt pain rip through my bodythen I pulled myself off, leaving a broad circular hole in the hull.The strange          creatures that dwelled on the hull were clinging to my body now, gnawing me painfully, but I ignored them.My quill had become          torn in the penetration; and blood dripped from my stomach.I crawled, in pain, further along the hull.Behind me, I knew, a small slow leak would have sprung up in the hull of the Hell Ship.Air from the outer world where the          Kaun dwelled was billowing out into space.I had ruptured the hull, and the inner seal, and the secondary inner seal; and,          or so I hoped, it would take time for the hulls self heal mechanisms to repair the breach.I did the same thing on another patch of hull.And again, and again.I performed the act one hundred times or more; and all          the holes in the hill hissed out air silently.Eventually the effort of it ripped my quill from my body, and blood gushed from my middle segment; but I thrust another quill          into the hull.I had twenty in all.After all twenty quills had ruptured, I was done.I crawled back along the hull towards the hatch, as blood slowly spilled from my body to form a long scarlet slick in the          midst of empty space.I lay on the green plain; the rate of flow had slowed, but the blood that was emerging from my body now was mixed with black          bile and entrails.The sheer power needed to thrust organic quill through hard metal had torn my insides apart.Lirilla flew above my head, fanning me with her wings, whispering words of comfort wrapped within a song of tender beauty: Brave Sai ias Joy Pleasure Hope Do Not Die.I blacked out and woke; and when I woke I realised I was surrounded by an army of my fellow captives.Thousands of them had          gathered, in silence, to comfort me in my pain, and perhaps to see me die.Fray ceaselessly poured healing water of the well of life from a bucket over my bloodied stomach segmentsparing me her healing          piss, for which I was grateful.A long chain of my fellow captives on this interior world brought fresh supplies of well water          ceaselessly.And for a while I wondered if these healing waters were going to work upon me; might I survive this ordeal, and enjoy future          days with Sharrock and the others as my friends once more?But the pain was getting worse not better.My guts and womb and heart and other internal organs had been crushed and ripped          in my huge effort; I was little more than a carcass of flesh surrounding a mess of damaged organs.It was becoming undeniable to me that my injures were too serious to be healed; the only salvation for me was resurrection.And that, I desperately hoped, would never happen; not if Sharrock and the others triumphed in this last terrible battle.For to be reborn as my twelve year old self, thrust back into this appalling world again!I could think of no greater horror.Sharrock was kneeling by my head, stroking me with his hand.He looked worse than I felt; but I was pleased to see the look          in his eyes.It was a look of rage, and a yearning for vengeance.I whispered to him, but he could not comprehend.So I opened my mouth; baring my huge jaws, and my sharp teeth.He reached inside with his hand, seeing the spark of ruby light          there.And when his hand emerged, he was holding the Jewel of the Seventh Sun.His gift to me, returned.I kept it safe, I said, but he did not comprehend.How goes the war?I asked of Quipu.Soon they will come, said Quipu One.Soon.Then you must kill, I said, those evil souls.We shall, said the Quipus.We shall, said Fray.Dont go, said Lirilla.Hell Ship           Sharrock You stupid fucking beast, I said to the dying Sai ias, you ignorant arse sucking cock kissing ingratiating, soft hearted,          infuriating, patronising whore bitchwhatever happens, we owe you everything!We thank you, ugly beast, from the depths of          our souls.And Ifuck it, I cant believe Im saying thisI love you.Can you understand a single fucking word of this?Sai ias grunted something which I could not comprehend; but I read the meaning in her eyes.And then her body deflated; her eyes dimmed; and she died.There was no time to mourn.We all knew what we had to do.We had to wait.The Kaun would be suffocating by now; their hull had been breached a thousand times and would be spewing air at a formidable          rate.I assumed they would have spacesuits with air tubes; that might buy them some time.But not much.The hull holes would heal themselves; but the air that had spurted out could not be easily replaced.A worlds          worth of air!No machine could generate that much fresh atmosphere in less than several weeks; by which time the Kaun would          all be dead.So they needed to take our interior world back; this would give them air enough for years, until they had replenished their          own supplies.And whats more, we had defied them.So they had no choice.They had to attack us.And when they did, we would be ready.An army of us had gathered, stretched across the Great Plain, breathing slowly, waiting for the moment.Fray, Quipu, Lirilla,          Raoild, Ioday Zubu, Doriel, Caramo, Doalyu, Sargan, Biark, Sahashs, Loramas, Thugor, Amur, Kairi, Wapax, Fiymean, Krakkka,          and more, many more.Quipu spoke; and Fray poured more water of life upon me.Despite my lack of skin, I felt strong and ready for battle.Fray spoke to Quipu; Quipu replied.I understood none of this.Lirilla uttered a sound: I actually recognised the word.Sai ias.Sai ias.She was singing the name of our dead friend.I clutched my sword, which Lirilla had brought to me; stolen I guessed from a Kindred in the Valley.It was a blade of near unbreakable          metal, forged from the walls of a Hell Ship cabin.I touched it; and felt its power.And we waited.And the silence was broken by Lirilla, singing to the sky.And when Lirilla had sung her song, Miaris howled, a melancholy howl; this was his song.And it was beautiful.And though I could not understand the language of the others, I realised immediately what was happening when Quipu began to          pace and chatter; and all of his five heads were talking, sharing, interrupting, and all were rapt as they listened to the          tale he was telling.And then Fray roared, and scraped her hooves, and spoke at length; and her tale, whatever it was, was surely magnificent.And as we waited still, more tales were told; and the creatures of the Hell Ship were united, a single family, bonded by one          creature; the dead Sai ias.And finally the story telling and the singing and the sharing was over.And our enemies came.The skies above us were black; I looked up and realised that three thousand or more Kindred warriors were flying in space armour          above us.Some were from the Valley, but most I guessed had been despatched from their barracks somewhere in the outer hull.The Kaun had sent their finest warriors to fight us!And the flying Kindred swooped down low upon the Great Plain, and their guns began to spit fire.And the aerials swooped upon them, knocking them from the sky.They flew in vast flocks, hundreds of them, pecking and ripping          at the motors that held the Kindred body armours aloft; and one by one the Kindred began to fall from the sky.And those that          fell were trampled under the hooves of the grazers and of Fray, or torn apart by the teeth of the giant sentients, or thrashed          and bitten to pieces by the angry arboreals.Or slain by me!For my sword did the work of a hundred Maxoluns, as I cut and slashed and killed!And as I fought, I thought of Sai ias.Blade at my head; duck to evade; weave; dagger in the throat; knee in the balls; on I fight!I mourned her, and I treasured her memory, insofar as I could treasure and mourn in the midst of a furious and bloody battle          with these huge and powerful Kindred warriors.(Back!Strike!Thrust!Fuck your parents for conceiving you and DIE!)Sai ias was brave indeed.She died to save us.And whats more, she left us a legacy; a way of love and forgiveness and respect          for the rhythms of life, and it is a way I intend to respect and to follow.Just as soon as I        WIN THIS FUCKING BATTLE!And thus We slew the armies of the Kindred!And lopped off their limbs, and shattered their skulls, and broke their bones!And they          slew us, or some of us; but our people were fierce beyond belief and though the Kindred had guns and armour and force fields          and cannons we had weight of numbers and fighting fury and a cause that was just.And so we crushed them.Literally in some cases.Fray trampled Kindred with her hooves; Quipu bit their throats out; Miaris, the largest of the giant sentients since Cuzco was gone, was          a creature of terror and carnage.And I slew fast and furiously, and dodged bullets, and sidestepped energy rays; for no one and nothing could defeat me on          this day.And so we fought, and won.And when the last Kindred body dropped to the ground, a cry of fear resounded out.For above us in the air were Cuzco, and Djamrock, and Tarroth, their great wings beating.And at the same the waters of the lake were draining away.And when the lake bed was fully dry an army of giant sentients          began to crawl and walk and trot towards us, in a long trail that led from the island of the Tower where the gateway to the          outer world was located.There was Balach, and Morio, and Tamal, and Sheenam, and Goay, and Leirak, and two headed Shseil,          and the serpentines Dokdrr and Ma, and more.And behind them walked ten bipeds dressed in red robes.Cuzco join us!I screamed up, and he laughed, and then he shat, and I had to dodge out of the way of his vast turd as it          crashed to earth.Fray, I said, we should attack while they are still in the lake, and I beckoned with one arm to make my meaning clear          to him.And Fray turned to me, and there was sadness in her eyes; but she did not move.Quipu?I turned to Quipu.His five heads were still; he was holding a home made sword in one of his hands and he pointed          the blade towards me.Around me were the bloodied corpses of the Kindred and the bodies of many of our own: Zubu was dead, and so was Doriel; and          Caramo also.Doalya the foolish blind aerialshe was a broken wreck.Sargan, who could drum his own body, had been eviscerated          by Kindred and his brains ripped out.But Biark was alive, and so was Sahashs, and Loramas, and Thugor, and many more.But none of them moved; they all had that eerie stillness.I was the only warrior left able to fight; my entire army had joined our enemy.And I realised that my strategy had failed;          the paklas still controlled each creatures mind, except for mine.And so I waited, a dreary patient wait for my own inevitable doom.Waited until the ten Kaun had walked across the dry lake          and had joined me on the battlefield, while their monsters stood flanking the lake shore like statues in a Sabol temple.And I watched as their leadera male with a face like black parchmentwalked towards me, proud and calm.He was the one I          had seen before; the one who had stared so curiously at my body as I dangled naked from a hook.Greetings Sharrock, he said, in my own language, without use of pakla.I am Minos; and I am the captain of this ship.You are the one who did this, arent you?You released me!I said, appalled, retrospectively, at my own stupidity.Yes.Minos did not smile, but he was clearly delighted at his own great joke.You disabled the pakla links, temporarily.I did.And it yielded us a battle most glorious.What I did to the Machine Mind Achieved precisely nothing.The power to control the paklas Minos tapped his forehead with a long fingeris here.All          in here.I nodded; my humiliation was complete.I had played the foolish pawn in Minoss cruel game.And yet I did not care.And now you are going to kill me?I asked.The Kaun drew his sword and held it aloft; the universal sign for a challenge.I stifled a gasp at this unexpected move; and wondered if this was merely another jest; and yet a flicker of hope stirred          in me.My name is Minos, said the Kaun.And I shall fight you for this world!And I nodded assent; then I raised my sword and attacked him.Above me Cuzco and Djamrock and Tarroth beat their wings in syncopation with the clang of my hull steel sword on Minoss far          superior fusion forged weapon.Fray and Quipu and all my comrades watched, paralysed, their bodies controlled by Kaun.The          giant sentients standing by the lake shore were silent too; and the nine other Kaun watched impassively as Minos recklessly          gambled their world on a single combat with a warrior supreme.And as I fought, I wondered if the nine other Kaun would honour Minoss bargain in the event of his death.For I was alone,          one warrior against an army of monsters; even if I did beat Minos, I could be slain by them with effortless ease.And yet, I sensed that Minos was sincere.With his black old face and his tired eyes, he looked as if he would welcome the          release of defeat in glorious battle.So with hope in my heart, I struck and I stabbed and I danced, and I used all my warrior skills against this aged slender          monster with the dry and withered face and the weary eyes; for I was Sharrock, and Sharrock could never, ever, be defeated!However, after a few minutes of masterly and dazzling and heroic swordplay I realised, to my utter and abject horror, that          I could not actually beat this bastard.For Minos was faster than me; and defter; and more skilful.His strokes were unerring, his grace was faultless, and he was          strong.His body looked punier than mine by far; but each strike of sword on sword shook me to the core.I leaped over his blade          but he leaped too and we fought in air, clashing swords wildly till we both somersaulted and landed back on grass, but his          mid air turn was faster and his fall more agile, and he struck again, and the blade cut my shoulder and blood flowed.My injuries were not to blame, for my battle strength was on me, and I fought like a Maxolun possessed.But even so I could          not compete with a devil like Minos.And then my blade shattered and I fell to the ground helpless and Minos raised his blade as if to cleave my head.But a female Kaun stepped forward; and fire sparked from her fingers.And Minos drew back.The female Kaun looked into my eyes, and I looked into hers; and I saw nothing there but nothingness.Then she drew her sword;          there were jewels on the hilt and the blade gleamed in daylight and then she passed it to me hilt uppermost; and when I held          it was like caressing a soul.A second Kaun stepped forward holding a jug and poured water from the well of life over my ripped and bleeding flayed body;          soothing my pain; giving me strength to continue.Fray roared; they gave her freedom to do that much.Cuzco beat his wings and stared down and I looked up at my old friend and acknowledged him.And the battle resumed.I was refreshed now, I had a superior sword, my comrades had shown their support; and my spirits were high!And yet still I could not win.Minos was the devil; his lean and wasted body was quicksilver, but his arms had the strength of a hundred          warriors.He played with me, forcing me backwards, parrying my blows so powerfully I grunted like a cathary; striking with          his sword so fast he sheared my hair and nipped my ears but not even deigning to kill me.And then he stabbed me in the heart;          but my second heart surged and it gave me the strength to continue with a brief attacking flurry.At which point he stepped aside with almost supernatural speed and I carried on fighting; my sword hacking at air until I          realised he was nowhere near me.And then, scornfully, Minos lowered his sword and raised his other hand and a pulse of energy surged out of his fingers and          struck my raw exposed body; and, with a bolt of sheer lightning from his fingertips, he electrocuted me!The energy bolt knocked me to the ground.I lay on the grass, breathing heavily, then I scrambled clumsily to my feet.He fired a second energy bolt and this time my entire flayed body lit up; my very veins seemed to be aflame.He fired a third time; and my two hearts burned in my chest and sparks shot from my eyes.And then there was silence.Minos held his sword lightly but he clearly thought the battle was over; his bio energy attacks were just a coup de grce and he was now waiting for me to remember how to die.And at that moment, I thanked my stars for one thing: that we Maxoluns also have the power of bodily electricity!It is, after all, what allowed me to open the locks in the exterior world.And it is furthermore the power that enabled me          to steal the Jewel of the Seventh Sun for Malisha.And thus the bolts of power that surged into my body had redoubled my strength, not sapped it.I felt as if Id drained a          glass of strong rich wine, and now was ready for the evenings misbehaving to begin!And so I lunged with my sword; and my blade was fast and the blade penetrated Minoss head through the soft skin on the underside          of his chin; then I thrust the blade up further into his brain; and he was dead.There was a shocked silence.And then a thundering of hooves; and Fray was at my side.And a swoosh of air, and Cuzco descended, and joined us.And Quipu too and Lirilla.Their babble of words made no sense to          me but I knew they were there to fight by my side.For now that Minos was dead, I realised, the power of the pakla had gone; it truly was his mind that had control of it.And so the creatures of this world were free.And, in consequence, we had the remaining nine Kaun entirely surrounded.There was a baying and roaring and a keening and a screeching from the great mob of creatures.And Mangan was suddenly at          my side too, roaring hysterically at the Kaun.Frays eyes were bloodshot with rage; thousands of alien creatures of every          kind and morphology were possessed with a terrible blood lust.And all we wanted to do was kill these evil fucking Kaun now.And I wondered what Sai ias would expect of us at this momentous moment.Would she want us to forgive and spare the Kaun,          now that they were helpless, and we were the ones with the power?I did not think so.Kill!I screamed and the charge began; and the female Kaun who had given me her sword raised her arms and looked me and          she actually smiled.And then she burst into flame.Her body became a burning candle.And the same happened with each of the other Kaun; their          bodily energy turned on itself and their flesh became fire.And the candles burned till the flesh was all gone.And the fires then were snuffed; and we knew the Kaun were dead.And we were left, we captives of the Hell Ship, free at last, on a world in space, confronted by pillars of ash and charred          bone that were all that remained of our captors.It was over.
