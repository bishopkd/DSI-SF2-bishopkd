..earpiece, the driver muttered softly, feeling on the carpet for it unsuccessfully.He knew he needed to call emergency medical services.He broke into a horrible coughing fit as a little blood dripped down from his lips.Solstice was done sitting idly by.She grabbed the drivers left pant leg and dragged him slowly out of the bedroom, across the living room, and up to the front door.Then, she began to bark and howl as loud as she could, clawing on the door.The driver wanted to move, but he passed out yet again.More falling led to him hitting another pond.This particular pond was in the middle of a road.He swam to shore, and as he climbed out, a speeding taxi blew right through him.Angrily, he brushed more algae of his gray long sleeve t shirt that had previously been dry.Aw come on!What, is Dallas just full of ponds or something?His angry shouting was silenced by laughter.He looked around the road, and a flying red truck passed right through him.Okay.Cars are going to have to stop with the whole ghost thing, the driver muttered.Running to the sidewalk, he looked around noting the neon lights that decorated downtown skyscrapers of Dallas.To his right he saw one of the oldest buildings in the city, even if it wasnt functional anymore.It was a giant yellow lit ball.It was previously used to celebrate the New Years holiday, but people had stopped doing that about 150 years prior to the drivers birth.Laughter again caused him to look around.Just up the sidewalk was a metal picnic table outside a food stand of some kind.The stand looked like it had seen better days with a red and yellow umbrella.The small metal hovering box had a tiny grill on top that the driver knew from experience made the best bacon cheeseburgers in the city.Seated at the table were Chris and the teen.The driver remembered this night.It was one of the first times hed had someone genuinely show kindness to him.One Galaxy Republic regulations on orphanages werent too strict.The government wasnt tyrannical by any means, but there were plenty of homeless kids in the galaxy.It was all the government could do to provide some form of shelter for them.The homes that the teen had been bounced to and from hadnt been the best places.Hed been raised by a drug dealer at one point and even a sex trafficker that was using foster kids to rent out to clients.That was the last one the teen ran away from.Now this Chris guy was engaging him in actual conversation and buying him a meal.The teen began to have a little faith restored in humanity, especially considering hed previously attempted to rob the guy who bought him dinner.Alright, Ill get us a couple ice cream bars, and we have got to hit the hay.Youre going to have to get up early tomorrow to help work off this meal, Chris said.The teen finished his burger and began to fish around in the brown paper bag for any remaining curly fries.Give me two ice cream bars, Jeff, Chris said.Jeff, a taller middle aged man in his 40s with gelled spiky hair, reached into the cooled compartment of his food cart and pulled out a couple objects wrapped tightly in foil and plastic.Chris paid him in cash from his nonstolen wallet and handed one to the teen.What work will I be doing tomorrow?Youll be going to get some registration identity documents from the Central Bureau of Identities, applying for your Small Class Ship Operators License, and then filling out paperwork for me to become my employee, Chris said.What do you do for a living?Im a manager at a hub for Starlight Taxi.I need a new driver pretty bad, and youre going to be that driver.You can start driving at age 16, start making a living, and then start saving up for a place of your own so you dont have to sleep on my couch, Chris said, finishing his dessert and wiping his mouth with a red and yellow napkin.Why go through all the trouble for me?I need a driver, and you need a future.It works out, Chris said.What if I dont want to be a cab driver?Then run, either now, or after my sweet wife Nancy gets you set up on the couch for the night and goes to bed.You can go another couple days trying unsuccessfully to steal from people and starve to death before the weekend.Its your choice.I just figured you might be smart enough to have the desire to live, Chris said, nonchalantly.Nice way to put it for a street kid, asshole, the driver thought, mouthing word for word what Chris had said from memory.The next few years wouldnt be easy for the teen, but Chris would ride his ass into a success story.The teen would spend the next 25 years driving a cab, eventually earning a diploma from a school system he had long given up on.He would grow into a responsible adult who didnt make much money but always paid his bills on time and had a place to live.Sometimes I forget how much I owe the old man, the driver muttered.As Chris led the teen home and they faded from view, the driver began to fall once more.Not again!This time, he felt a weight on his legs and heard beeping machinery.His eyes slowly opened, and the bright light made his head throb.Something sharp was in his arm, and there was a thin blanket covering him.As his eyes slowly adjusted, he saw that Solstice was laying on his legs napping.She must have heard his breathing pick up.She looked and saw her owner awake and excitedly crawled up to lick his cheek.Okay, okay, I get it.Youre happy Im not dead.Down girl, the driver muttered, feeling the effects of cotton mouth.Do I dare ask where I am?He looked around and noticed the IV in his arm.It was a small private room with a curtain pulled back revealing a door to the bathroom and a small TV hanging from the ceiling.Southeast Mercy Hospital near downtown Lefont, a woman said.The driver looked over and saw a familiar sight walking into his hospital room.Karmen!What are you doing here?The tall woman stood before him wearing a very simple and short velvet dress.The driver didnt realize this the last time hed seen the bartender from Europa.There was no design on the low cut red velvet dress.It simply outlined her figure and went down to her thighs.I need to wake up in hospitals more often, the driver thought.Well, I saw you leaving the bar from Europa, and I assumed youd come to find me and werent successful.So, I got in another cab and followed you back.We were a few minutes behind you when we got to Earth due to traffic, but once we landed outside your home, I heard your dog howling and barking like mad.I called for help, and here you are, she explained.Last time he saw her, she had purple hair, a tattoo above her right eye, and a pierced nose.Now, she didnt have any of those things.Her long hair was now dark red.Thanks for...saving me.Um, one question...what happened to your...bartender look?Oh.I had optics implanted in my hair.It can change colors in a few minutes.The tattoo and piercing were fake.I just look that way because the roughnecks who frequent the bar dont like the punk look.It keeps most of them away from me except for when they want more booze.Huh, the driver said.Huh?Oh, nothing.You just look so..., the driver couldnt finish his sentence.Normal?Its okay, Mr.Scared To Hurt My Feelings, you can admit you like me better this way, she said, walking over and petting Solstice.The red husky didnt appear to like her too much, but it tolerated another person being close to the driver.Solstice understood that this girl had saved her friends life.Any idea what it was that put me in this bed?A rare parasite known as Yupke Larvae, a woman in a white coat said, walking in.She was a young Hispanic girl with short curly brown hair.She had a rich accent, but it was still easy to understand her.Parasite?Yes.I dont know where you picked it up, but Im the physician that diagnosed and treated you right away, ultimately saving your life.Im Dr.Espinoza, she said, checking the see through tablet computer at the foot of his bed and tapping different parts of the screen to get updated data.Well thank you...was I really that bad off?Another voice entered the room, this one the least attractive of all.He got the parasite from a ship stop vending machine sandwich.The idiot isnt exactly the healthiest eater, Chris said, slapping the sandwich wrapper down on a table to the drivers right.You went through my garbage?Im a little disturbed and slightly violated, the driver muttered.You were almost dead, you idiot!I told you to take better care of yourself and watch what you eat!The driver hated getting health advice from Chris, but in the past decade or so, hed lost enough weight to be considered healthy again.He was still a big boy, but he was down to about 200 pounds now thanks to leg weights he wore everywhere he went.Fine.No more ship stop sandwiches, the driver said.Chris mouth was wide open at hearing the drivers words.Thats it?No arguing?The driver, in light of some memories coming to the forefront of his mind, decided to cut Chris some slack.Thats it, the driver said.Chris was speechless and said nothing for several minutes The driver saw a small glass with ice water in it to his left.He reached for it and took a drink.Drink slow.Youve been out for about a week now, Dr.Espinoza said.The drivers eyes widened A week?Yes.You came in last Friday, and today is the following Friday.It took your body quite a while to recover from being severely dehydrated by the parasite.Thats what it does to you.Often it isnt caught soon enough and kills its host.Youre lucky your dog and girlfriend were looking out for you.Whoa whoa whoa  Honey, why dont you calm down, Karmen said, running her fingers through his hair.The doctors ear piece buzzed, and she excused herself from the room.Chris walked over and handed the driver his pub hat.The driver put it on and instantly felt a little better.Hed been missing something since he woke up, but he didnt know exactly what the item was.Ill leave you and your girlfriend to it then, Chris said, turning to go.Thanks, Chris, the driver said somewhat quietly, causing him to turn around and raise an eyebrow.Did you have attitude surgery while you were in here?No...you know, I just was remembering Dallas as of late and decided to cut you a little slack for the time being, the driver said, taking another small drink of water.Oh...well okay then.See you Monday, Chris said.Oh damn!My vacation time!Relax.You had five sick days to use, and you hadnt taken any sick time off yet this year, so, youre fine, Chris said.I thought we only got two sick days?Chris sighed and slapped his forehead.That policy was changed a few months back when the Department of Labor Standards issued Starlight Taxi a written warning and a fine for violating sick day policy.All workers with at least five years under their belt get five sick days.Geez, you really dont read the weekly memos I send out, do you?Sorry.Ill read them from now on, the driver said.Chris shook his head and left muttering, He needs to have near death experiences more often if hes this nice afterwards.Now that Karmen and the driver were alone, except for Solstice, he looked at her and squinted.Girlfriend?Relax.It was the only way theyd let me in the room with you, she said, running her fingers through his hair again.We havent even been on a date together, the driver said.Well, you went to Europa to ask me on a date...you just nearly died before you could get to the asking part, Karmen said, walking over to her purse that shed put down when she entered the room.How do you know I went to Europa to ask you out?Really?Are we seriously going to do this elementary school check the yes box if you have a crush on me crap?Youre in your 40s.Act like it, grow a pair, and accept that you owe me a nice dinner and some form of entertainment, Karmen said.Geez.Shes direct, the driver thought to himself.Okay...a date...whenever I get out of here, the driver said.Dr.Espinoza told me earlier in the week that you could leave 24 hours after regaining consciousness, assuming your body was done rehydrating.Im kind of creeped out that she knows more about my diagnosis and condition than I do, the driver thought.Have you been here all week?Chris stepped in to relieve me, but the two of us didnt really leave your side.I only just got back though, she said, still rummaging around in her big red purse.The driver heard paper rattling somewhat, and he wondered what she was up to.Thanks for staying.Where did you get back from?She walked over with a brown paper bag and put it on the table next to the driver.I went to Dallas at Chris suggestion to get you some dinner on the off chance you woke up tonight, Karmen said.The driver recognized the scent inside the brown paper bag.You didnt...Jeffs?Chris mentioned you were a fanatic about that place, Karmen said, handing him a bacon cheeseburger wrapped in foil.Okay, maybe two dates, the driver said, unwrapping his burger.Solstice started to inch her way toward the treat, but the drivers growling stopped her, and she retreated to the foot of the bed.He tore off a tiny piece and tossed it down at her.She caught it in her mouth, and then the driver went to town on his burger, thankful for Solstice, Karmen, and even Chris.7: Pulling Strings  As the driver finished putting the waffle on a green plate, he heard a knock at the front door.Solstice got up and walked over to the door, turning her head back around to look at the driver.He opened it, and there stood a man in a brown uniform holding a brown styrofoam square with a specialized coffee in it.It was a mocha frappuccino with foam and made with soy milk, Karmens favorite.Order for...Karmen?Yeah, thats me.The delivery guy, a man with slick black hair and a neatly kept beard raised an eyebrow at the driver.I mean  The driver took the coffee, and the delivery man threw up his hands.Hey man, you know what?It aint my business what choices you make in your life.If you say youre Karmen, I believe youre Karmen.More power to ya, the coffee delivery man said.The driver sighed and bumped his pay bracelet against the delivery mans.It was a simple tight black band with a small chip inside that held financial data linked to the drivers bank account.It was mostly how he paid for everything.In fact, it was how most people paid for things.A few older people still carried cards with magnetic strips on them to pay for items, but most businesses were starting to refuse those due to transaction costs.The bracelet worked simply.You bumped it against another bracelet or wireless pay station, and funds were transferred instantly to cover the cost of whatever one needed to buy.Your receipt is in your  Communication unit.Got it, the driver said.Have a good day, maam...I mean.Ummm  The driver just closed his door growling and walked into the kitchen with Solstice trailing behind whining.He looked at the black digital clock that sat on his coffee table in front of his black leather couch.I already fed you....You need to go out?She walked over to the back sliding glass door and pawed at it.The driver slid it open quietly and let her out.She ran out into the grass and began sniffing around.Maybe that will keep her happy for a bit.I know she still isnt too happy about getting kicked out of my room last night, the driver muttered.He reached into a cabinet and pulled out a small wooden tray, unfolding both legs and setting it on the counter.When he was finished, the wooden tray had silverware, a green plate with a waffle on it, coffee, and a small saucer with sliced apple.He carried it all carefully into his bedroom where the real Karmen was still slumbering.After last night, I dont blame her, the driver said, smirking.It was a Friday morning, but he had taken the day off to be with Karmen since she was about to leave to work a weekend shift on Europa.It had been about two months since hed almost died from a parasite rapidly dehydrating him, and he mostly had his strength back.She had heard Solstice howling like mad inside the home and called emergency medical personnel.The two had been dating since, and she was staying at his townhouse more and more.His feet met the green carpet of his bedroom, and he opened his door.She stirred lightly, hearing the noise.Rise and shine, Karmen, the driver said, softly.She came to and rubbed her eyes, yawning.You...oh you didnt, she said, her eyes widening.I didnt what?Get your favorite coffee delivered?Make you breakfast in bed?She smiled as he set the tray down in front of her.Thank you, she said, taking the silverware and cutting a piece of the waffle.She added a little syrup and ate it.I do love a guy who can cook, she said, melting into bliss.He pulled up a chair by the bed, and they talked while she ate breakfast.They made plans on what to do with their last day together before she headed back to Europa.He was about to pick up her tray and carry it back into the kitchen when he heard his earpiece buzzing over on his dresser.Oh no.Not today.That old man is not calling me in for anything, the driver growled, walking over and putting the earpiece in his left ear.Not today, old man.I know you have the day off, but I need you to just do one quick pickup please, Chris said.Forget it, Chris.I got plans with my lady today, the driver said.I know...but  No.The client is me, Chris said.The driver raised an eyebrow and said, Come again?I need a ride home.My car broke down, and I.  ..kind of just lost my job, Chris said, quietly.The drivers throat tightened.How could...
