That, and the ripples of sinuous silver that occasionally materialized from deep within the gigantic object to flow from right to left before being reabsorbed into the specular body from which they had initially emerged.No railing, no barrier separated her and her companions from stepping into gaping infinity.As she recovered her equilibrium and her brain struggled to make sense of what she was seeing, she picked out in the downward distance some sort of ramp or avenue.Suspended in the dark, it pierced the side of the ovoid like a hypodermic, drawing out not cells but tiny figures.Her pounding heart seemed to have risen into the vicinity of her throat.She grew aware that Sarah was speaking.Very few humans, Naturals or Melds, have seen the ship.But you needed to be convinced.We want you to be convinced because we require the assistance of human doctors.Naturals such as yourself are especially valued.She hardly heard the escort.Staggered by the sight before her, still fighting to maintain her balance, she realized now that the industrial fabrication site she and Whispr had discovered after crawling through one of Nerenss climate control ducts was not Morgan Ouspels Big Picture.This was the Big Picture.Its real, and it moves, Ouspel had told them.And the Painters of the Big Picture, those who made it move, were Alien.Not of this world.And Het Kruger had called her an intruder.Having seen far more of the extreme than his companion, Whispr was better equipped to maintain his mental stability.Concentrating on the prosaic helped.How can you get something this big on and off the surface of the planet without being detected coming or going?He nodded into the abyss.Sounds muted by distance drifted up to them.Youre gonna tell me youve got some kind of cloaking device or something, right?No, Johan corrected him.The ship does not move from space into this place.Instead, we shift the very small bit of space that contains the ship.Your simple detection devices do not detect the movement of space.You do not yet possess the math necessary to comprehend the relevant field equations.Thats all right, Whispr murmured.I dont feel deprived.So it is an invasion.Not in the sense you are thinking of it, Sarah told him.An agricultural metaphor would be more apt.We are turning the soil and watering the first seedlings.The slender Melds tone darkened.Regarding himself as dead already he saw no point in holding back.If nothing else he could at least express his outrage and thereby gain some final, if not lasting, satisfaction.What the hell are you monsters watering?Ingrid flinched.Calling their escorts monsters was unlikely to help their situation.Johan appeared to take no umbrage, however.We are watering those shoots that are having difficulty thriving among your kind.Logic.Reason.Common sense.The realization that the cosmos is vast and sentience rare.Weaving slowly back and forth atop its neck, the great compound eye tilted in the humans direction.We do not seek conquest.That is an ancient and self defeating attitude.We wish only to establish a permanent friendship.New friends are forever welcome.Whispr was not appeased.Funny kind of handshake you have.Your kind is not ready to receive it in full.Your world is seething with frustration, confusion, uncertainty.You need help.If it was offered openly, you would refuse it.As a species you are close to suicidal.This pains us to an extent you cannot imagine.We cannot stand by and watch you consume yourselves.To do so would be morally indefensible.The jumble of golden spikes that was Sarah tiptoed closer.Ingrid held her ground.Though still distrustful she discovered that, unexpectedly, she was no longer afraid.While the aliens intent was still unknown, their tone and manner was anything but threatening.Some of Sarahs earlier words came back to her.You said you require the assistance of human doctors.What for?Once more the male voice emerged from beneath the eye.To install the implants, of course.Aha!Whisprs shout was accusing.If that doesnt signal a hostile invasion I dont know what does!He whirled on Ingrid.Theyre taking control of our youth.You told me yourself that the implants have only been found in teens.We are taking control of no one, Sarah explained.Of what use is a friend devoid of free will?Ingrid was torn between Whisprs indignation and the aliens protest.If not control, then what is the purpose of the implants?An analog of a sigh issued from the center of the intertwined gold spires.Human couriers transport them around the world to those physicians who have engaged with us.Traitors to the species, Whispr growled.The old man Cricket and I riffled in Savannah: he was a courier.Or a co opted doctor.Or both.Ingrid was nodding vigorously.Remember Morgan Ouspels reaction when we showed him the thread?He called it a distributor.She looked back at the alien Sarah.It was full of your implants.That is how they are transported, Sarah admitted.On the thread they exist as a stabilized dichotomy: field circuitry imprint in one part, foiled metal in the other.It is only when they are combined that a functional implant results.Ingrid recalled her and Whisprs several attempts to divine what was on the thread by probing it with various readers.No wonder all had proven futile.When the particular distributor of which you speak disappeared on your continent, steps were taken to ensure that it did not come to the attention of one of your tribal governments or your wide ranging media.We were only peripherally involved in these prophylactic steps.That is one reason why initial attempts to recover it on a local basis were clumsy and awkward.Such recovery procedures are the responsibility of our human associates, a portion of whom operate within the organization you commonly call SICK, Inc.More traitors.Whispr could barely restrain himself.Their clumsiness got an old mudbud of mine deaded.You havent told us what the implants do, Ingrid reminded their escorts.Sarah continued.The implants are tinyyou would say transmitters.Ingrid remembered the signal boosting experiment they had performed on the thread in the shop of the tech Meld Nokhot, in underground Orangemund.What do they transmit?Endocrinal suggestions, Johan told her.Neurological correctives.Very slight adjustments to the dispersion of endorphins and other substances.Your kind still exists in a state of evolutionary stasis that prizes self preservation over cooperation.This hinders both the survival and maturation of your species.Confined as it is now to a single habitable system, the cosmos could wipe out your entire population in a single stroke.An exceptional series of solar flares, comet strikes, a high energy particle storm from a nearby supernovathis has happened before, to others.To survive potential catastrophe on a cosmic instead of a local scale you will need the help ofeveryone else.But you are not socially or culturally prepared for such intervention, Sarah informed them.That comes only when the individual members of a species recognize that the survival and well being of all supersedes and takes precedence over the survival instincts of the one.Whispr turned bitter.Some of whom you dont mind killing if they threaten to interfere with your galactic good Samaritans.That cannot be denied, she replied calmly.We regret the need to employ such means.But your people cannot be made aware of our presence until such time as they have matured sufficiently to accept it for what it is: an intervention for the benefit of the entire species.The odd twang in her voice hardened slightly.The methods employed to preserve the secrecy required for the continued proper functioning of this facility are your own.We did not import them.What do these correctives and suggestions youre talking about actually do?Ingrid continued to be fascinated both by the alien speakers and their explanations.Subsidiary orbs as well as the big compound eye turned to her.In summary and taken together they serve to mute the destructive priorities that favor individual self preservation over that of the species as a whole.The neurological signals are most effective when applied to the mature but not yet fully fossilized cortical structure of humans of a certain age.Given the very limited number of your colleagues who have agreed to cooperate in achieving these ends and who have been trained in the implantation procedure, it was decided to concentrate on those of your young who have suffered poor or inaccurate meldings.Eventually the changes necessary to ensure humankinds survival will have been inculcated in enough of your youth so that inducing neurological adjustments by means of the implants will no longer be necessary.It will take some time.But time we have, and we have learned to be patient.We cannot suddenly fix all that is wrong with your present social order.For an indeterminate amount of time, more of you will perish at your own hands than should be necessary.But we can, slowly, fine tune your future for the betterment of your kind.And one day, when you face a global catastrophe, or when the time is simply right, we will reveal ourselves.All his eyes looked at Whispr.Then will occur a collective mental handshake that will encompass every sentient being on this world.Ingrid remembered the potentially deadly intertribal clash that had been broken up in Cape Town by a band of singing, unarmed youths.She struggled to recall the words of the young lemur Meld who had tried to pickpocket her purse.What was it he had said when he had abruptly scurried off to help put a damper on the looming conflict?The old ways must go passing by.Tribal feuds must be stopped.Not only here but everywhere.Is for betterment of human species I go.And when Ingrid had wondered aloud why he had chosen to risk his own welfare on behalf of people he did not even know ?Not sure.Must try, he had replied.She understood now.It made sense now.Three bad melds he had undergone, the young Meld had told her and Whispr.Three times under the biosurges instruments, and still he was not right.Which meant there had been three opportunities for a human doctor to install one of the clandestine corrective alien implants.Apparently it took only one such quantum entangled bit of intervention to turn a street thief into an effective mob suppressor.Was it so bad, then, what the aliens were doing?she thought.Helping the human species to mature?To focus on cooperation in place of conflict?If Sarah and Johan were to be believed, every young person who had been implanted still retained full control of their faculties, still functioned with free will.That wasnt mind control.The fact that the youthful lemur Meld was still practicing riffling when they had encountered him was proof enough of that.But when the greater good was at stake, when two mobs threatened to engage one another in an orgy of typically human essentially senseless violence, alien suggestions kicked in via the transplants to mitigate the aggression.Realization hit home like a kick in the head.She and Whispr had been rescued from the twisted attentions of Napun Mol, had been brought to this place and shown irrefutable evidence of the aliens existence and presence, for one reason and one reason only.To help safely install the increasing number of implants in meld damaged young humans the aliens needed human doctors.They needed her.II understand what you want from me now.She turned away from the black void and the gargantuan craft behind her.Youve explained yourselves clearly and you make a good case.But II just dont know.It is a great deal to grasp and comprehend at one time.For the first time, Sarah was openly sympathetic.When one knows only the insularity that comes from living on a single world and is ignorant of all else, the scale of things on a cosmic basis can be overwhelming.Dont do it, docIngrid!Whispr was slower on the uptake than his more educated companionbut not dead slow.This could all be nothing but a quick ass cover story for a real invasion!We dont have any real proof of anything theyre saying.He lowered his voice.The fox is explaining how to fix the henhouse.Turning to him in a daze, she mustered a response.Whispr, look at all this.The implant technology, the MSMH metallurgy, this facility and thisship.Even the little underground shuttle that brought us here.All of it examples of technology that are beyond our dreams.Dont you think if they just wanted to conquer us they could do so easily?But what would be the point?You do understand.Johan was plainly pleased.Planets, astronomical bodies, natural resourcesin the galaxy these are as common as dust.Habitable worlds are plentiful.Far more have been discovered than could ever be settled.What is rare, what is precious, what cannot be synthesized, is sentience.That is to be preserved, to be nurtured, to be helped to flourish like the rare flower it is.He paused, the huge multilensed central eye inclined in her direction.Humankind is one of those rare flowers.Yeah, right!Whispr protested.He was stalking back and forth now, waving his long scarecrow arms for emphasis.Just like each of your kind is a rare flower, huh?How many of you are there, anyway?He nodded sharply at the attentive collection of spires, then at the assemblage of eyes.How many helpful species?We do not know for certain, Sarah told him quietly.Not anymore.Her reply caused a suddenly bemused Whispr to halt.What do you mean you dont know for certain?There was a time when we did, Johan explained.After a while it was no longer considered important.Save for a few scattered historians the relevant parties ceased to care.We have all become as one.Ah.A self satisfied Whispr looked at Ingrid as if to say I told you so.I knew it.There always has to be a boss.He smirked at the two aliens.There always has to be someone on the top, someone in charge.Someone whos more interested in themselves than in some poofy pie in the sky greater good.Which race is it?He stared intently at Sarah.The spine collectives?His attention shifted to the watching Johan.Those who can keep an eye on everybody and everything else?Or is it the mammal bug giant we had to dodge in the corridor, or some species we havent met yet?For a second time something like a sigh issued from the depths of the gleaming golden being that called itself Sarah.We know the kind to whom you refer, Whispr.They do not dwell in secrecy.They are present everywhere here and in plain sight.The cathedral like collage of motile gold spires faced him directly.They are you.The Sum of Her Parts     16 Ingrid gawked; first at the alien, then at her companion.For once Whispr had nothing to say.At that moment even his innate sarcasm had deserted him.Sarah broke the stunned silence.You are a Meld, Whispr.We call such willingly induced transformations by other names, but meld will serve as well as any.What is known as the General Transformation began many thousands of your years ago, when the technology of bodily and biological manipulation on several worlds reached the stage where it is at on your Earth now.You could call it shape freedom.As your kind is just beginning to discover, once the techniques of cell alteration and growth, of nonrejecting grafts and aesthetic biodesign and related skills are mastered, it becomes possible for anyone to look like anyone else.Or like anything they wish.Any shape that can be imagined will be.If it can be envisioned, sculpted, drawn, haloed, or described, someone will opt to look like it.The evolution of the immediate individual becomes a matter of personal choice limited only by the imagination of the person and the skill set of his, her, or its attending biosurges, gengineers, and other masters of the meat.Our equivalents of your cosmetic surgeons have mastered techniques of which yours have not yet even fantasized.She turned to Johan and let him continue.I myself, the anthology of eyes explained, have undergone twelve full body shiftsor melds, if you prefer.My initial self looked nothing like this, nor did several of my intervening physicalities.Twice I chose to look like the original Sthan.By all historical accounts a most symmetrical people.But it is almost impossible to find one who looks like that now.They have been shifting and melding for millennia.So the Sthan you see today is more likely an honorific meld of an entirely different species who has chosen to become like the Sthan.You see how it goes, Sarah told them.An individual may choose to look like an ancestor, another species, or something entirely fanciful that has no precedent in the evolutionary record.It is now simply a matter of moving mind and body, of shuffling organic and inorganic components.As a consequence, the civilized species of the galaxy are all mixed up.No one can say for certain where anyone else comes from.We are all one with the multitude.There is no longer such a thing as shapeism.One is judged on other qualities.As your kind will one day learn to do.But only a few of you know this, she finished.So to prevent panic and forestall defection we move among the majority of you in reassuring disguise, the better not to sow confusion.The fat suits, Ingrid thought aloud.Yes.With the aid of internal mechanisms and adjustments they are large enough to conceal a multitude of different forms.A tapering spire gestured in her colleagues direction.Even body types as different as Johan and I.  Most who work with us and for us are unaware of our true multiplicity of shapes.So then.Multi  and single lensed, all Johans eyes focused simultaneously on Ingrid.You know everything.You know more than most of your kind.Your pursuit of answers in spite of being marked for elimination, in spite of everything, recommends you.Your determination to reach this place of isolation recommends you.Most notably, your lack of panic and your desired skills recommend you.As an overwhelmed Ingrid vacillated, Sarah added something that hit the beleaguered doctor especially hard.If it is knowledge that you seek, if that truly is what brought you to this place and to this moment in time, we can open the universe to you.Wasnt that what she had wanted all along?Ingrid thought wildly.Answers, scientific explanations, understanding?First they had tried to have her killed and nowNo, that wasnt quite right, she told herself.Operating semi independently, it was the aliens human interface that had sought her termination.Because as far as the aliens were concerned, individuals didnt matter.Not when the maturation and survival of an entire species was at stake.Her species.Didnt she owe it to the rest of her kind to help in accelerating their social and mental growth?Didnt she owe it to herself?Whispr saw the transformation washing over his companion as clearly as he had seen the churning waters of the desert flash flood threaten to suck her down and drown her.These creatures, these inhuman things, were playing with her mind.Persuading, coaxing, cajoling her with lies and falsehoods, alternating threats with promises.And she was falling for it!He could see it as surely as he could see a citizen being scammed on the Savannah waterfront.Interposing himself between her and the aliens he pushed his face close to hers.Ingrid!Listen to me.Its Whispr.Remember?You brought me along to help you find your way through situations that were alien to you and to your life experience.He gestured at the silently watching creatures.Well, I cant imagine a situation any more alien than this!Its still an invasion, doc.They still want to take us over and control useven if only with pretty words!If we wished to take control of you, Whispr, the alien Sarah told him, we would have done so already.Or allowed the human predator Mol to have you.Instead, we brought you here and fed you freely of the most precious of all nutrientswisdom.Her mildly mechanical voice fell slightly.That is the most we can do.We cannot tell you what to do with what we have given you.That is for you and you alone to decide.Light glimmered within eyes on stalks.Free will.Free will?Ill show you free will.Ill show you what it means to be human and unimproved.Turning away from the honey voiced spires he tried to will himself through Ingrids eyes and deep into her being.Doc, you cant do this.You cant let yourself be taken in by thesecreatures.Gazing back at him she said simply, Why not, Whispr?Why shouldnt I believe them?Why shouldnt I agree to help?For the good of all humankind.Because, he choked slightly, because II love you.Whispr!She had thought that nothing could shock her out of her reverie, and he had just proven her wrong.Dont do this, docIngrid.Dont listen to them.They spin words the way spiders spin silk.Theyre watering us, all right.Theyre watering you with what you want to hear so that youll buy into their scheme and go to work for them.Dont do it!She swallowed.Its too late, Whispr, she told him softly.Ive already bought into it.Looking past him, she locked perception with Sarah.Are you really female or did you just choose that name to make things comfortable for me and my friend?I was once female, the jumble of mobile spires assured her.In my present form gender has no meaning.Im not sure I completely buy that.She looked back at her companion.Im truly, truly sorry that you love me, Whispr.For a man whos had to deal with so much tragedy in his life I feel bad about having to add to it.But while Ive grownfond of you, I dont love you.Not in the way you want.I do believe these people, and I believe in what theyre working toward, and Imstaying.He stepped back from her, his expression tortured.Youve been co opted.I dont get entirely how, but Im not blind.I dont have to have something thrown in my face to see whats happening.Whispr, listen.She moved to close the physical if not the emotional distance that had opened up between them.No!He threw up his hands.What would they do to him now?They had swallowed the doctor.It was Ingrid whose cooperation, whose concession they wanted.Hehe was nothing to them.His life was meaningless.As meaningless as that of any individual when measured against the health of the species.Hadnt they said as much?He looked around wildly.Ill get out of this, Ingrid!Somehow, some way, Ill get out of it.And Ill come back for you, and Ill get you help, I promise!He was backing away from the three of them now, his hands held out defensively in front of him.Ill get help!Whispr man.Sarah Spires was advancing toward him, her golden limbs gleaming and outstretched in his direction, as much machine as mortal.You are wrong, so very wrong.Let us help you to Whirling, his thoughts aflame and his soul burning, he took one step, pushed off, and leaped into the emptiness behind him.As he fell he made no noise and heard no sound save for the swift fading above him of Ingrid Seastroms scream.HE MUST HAVE BLACKED OUT, he told himself as he rolled over.He remembered jumping into the void.At the same time as the memory returned he grew aware that he was not dead, not falling, and not in pain.Given his recollections, this conflation of realities made no more sense than did the solid, gritty surface on which he was lying.As he opened his eyes a slight breeze teased his corneas.The air smelled dry and faintly of mint.His view was split horizontally between beige, yellow, and a deep blue.He was back in the desert.Bewildered but glad to be alive, he rose slowly to his feet.In place of the medical assistants attire he had been wearing he found himself back in his desert garb.His backpack lay nearby.A quick check revealed that with the exception of his communicator its contents were intact.Even to, and most important of all, his survival waterpak.How had it come to be here?How had he come to be here?Standing, he drew renewal from contact with the clean, natural earth.He turned a slow circle.There was no indication that he was floating in some alien hallucination or disguised void.Soaring on dark wings, a black and white Namib crow came cawing overhead.He tilted his head back to track its path.No angel ever looked better, no cherubim ever warbled a more welcome aria.Of Nerens there was no sign.He was back in the desert, yes, but it could be anywhere in the desertand while no Sahara, the Namib was vast enough.An accident of some sort, he told himself.Something had caught him before he had struck the ebony ship and kicked him out here, like a character in a vit game.He was alive and free.For an experienced riffler like himself that was enough.It was all he needed.He would survive now.He would make it back to civilization.There he would tell his story, somehow hire or inveigle or persuade others of its veracity, and return here with a whole avenging army.Let the invaders try to lock him in an examination room then!It would be he and his allies who would be doing the interrogating.His one regret, the only thing that gave him pause and kept him from setting off southward immediately, was that he was leaving Ingrid Seastrom behind.Brainwashed or otherwise duped, there was nothing he could do for her now.Not by himself, without outside assistance.Bending, he picked up his pack and slung it across his narrow back.The weight of it was further assurance that he was not dreaming.He didnt need the communicator, he told himself.He was used to surviving on and with almost nothing.Direction he could determine by monitoring the sun.Determined and with increasing confidence, he started southward.She was waiting for him on the other side of the next dune.Behind her a flat gravel plain stretched for kilometers off to the south.Unseen in the distance lay Orangemund and civilization.Between them laya difference of perception.She had been remelded.Gone was the red hair, the zaftig shape, the camouflaging adjustments to her cheekbones and ears and the rest of her face that had been necessary to disguise her from Mol and the rest of SICKs hunters.She was once again the same attractive but far more normal woman who had pulled police traktacs out of his back in her office in Savannah.She was, in other words, more beautiful than ever.Even if her mind had been co opted by aliens.Ingrid!He started to rush toward her, then caught himself.This wasnt right.It couldnt be right.It wasnt a dream, but it was everything that if given the chance he would have dreamed.How did you get here?How did I get here?She gave a slight shrug.The visitors can move space with a starship inside it.Moving a person or two isnt difficult.They prefer not to use the technology here unless they have no choice.Theres too much chance of the energies involved being detected and remarked upon.They make exceptions for ships.Ships?He remembered the immense black shape.Theres more than one?Many, she told him.Over time they come and they go.The visitors are patient.She smiled kindly at him.They moved you.They moved me.So youre coming with me, then?You convinced them to let you go?He tried to restrain his excitement.It was good that he did.No, she explained gently.I convinced them to let you go.Im still staying.I wanted to say goodbye, Whispr.She smiled anew.You didnt give me much of a chance.I owe you a great deal.If not for you I wouldnt have been exposed toeverything.By everything you mean the invasion and takeover of humanity?he shot back.She sighed.You heard, but you didnt listen.Theres no point in arguing and nothing more to be said.I wish you all the best, Whispr.Youre a better man than you think you are.Im still coming back for you, Ingrid.I wont be here.Im going back to Savannah to resume my practice.Ill go back to doing what I do best, only now for a greater and more noble cause.His expression twisted.Ive been around and seen a lot, Ingrid.But I dont think Ive ever seen anyone so smart perverted so quickly.Converted, not perverted.Wait a minute.He stared back at the familiar feminine shape silhouetted against the perfect blue of the Namib sky.You told me how I got out here, but not why.Why didnt they just let me fall to my death?For the same reason they didnt leave you to Mols mercies.As you were falling I told them if they didnt help you to live, then once again I would refuse to assist them.They plucked you out of nothingness and put you out here.She shook her head sorrowfully.More than that I cant do for you, Whispr.She indicated his backpack.Youve got whats left of our supplies.Nerens security wont bother you.I think you can make it out of here.I hope you can.A dark mist began to coalesce around her.She eyed it unperturbed as it continued to thicken, like air made from ink.The visitors dont understand long goodbyes.My time is circumscribed.Ill make it out of here, all right!he yelled as he started toward her.And when I do, Ill tell everyone!About this place, about the invaders and their brainwashing, about everything!Ill come back for you with soldiers and writers and vit correspondents hanging out of a dozen floaters!Ill scatter this whole treacherous implant invasion plan across both oceans!Wreathed in ebon haze, she shook her head sadly.No you wont, Whispr.Because no one will believe you.To those youll want to convince youll be just another crazy ass street riffler.Just like the one who hung around my office until I had no choice but to acknowledge him and his problems.Her frown turned to a smile.Kind of a cute one, though.The haze became a solid as he covered the last couple of meters between them.He reached out for it; to catch it and hold it and keep it close.Then it was gone.One moment he was running toward a pane of black glass and the next, a puff of vapor that dispersed through his clutching arms to vanish into the desiccated air like dust in a furnace.He was alone again.THE SAN HUNTING PARTY found him out of food and nearly out of water, his waterpak having failed four days earlier.Brought delirious into their temporary hunting encampment, he babbled incessantly.They ignored it all.The poor rail of a Meld was clearly out of his head.Carried by stretcher and by hand, the half conscious survivor was transferred from one group to another until he was eventually deposited, still weak but much improved in health, outside the entrance to the national park station at Rosh Pinah.Examining the contents of his backpack and the condition of his shoes led the rangers to believe he was an undocumented hiker who had lost his way in Fish River Canyon.He was quickly airlifted to the hospital at Karasburg.It was while recovering there that he found the rough diamonds that had been secreted in the depths of his backpack.A gift of the San?he wondered.Or a kindly farewell of sorts from a certain empathetic physician in league with visitors for whom diamonds were perhaps nothing more than tainted carbon.She really must have convinced them that he was harmless.Converting the rocks to subsist was no problem in Gaborone, a traditional gem dealing center.From there he fled first class from the southern quadrant of the continent.But not home to Savannah.Other personages than the doctor might be waiting to see if he did indeed return there.Instead he made his way to India.There he regaled the media with tales of gigantic buried spaceships and the mental manipulation of teenagers supervised by traitorous human doctors who were in league with melded aliens.His rambling discourses were met with the reception they deserved.Propelled and supported by the subsist he had realized from his diamond sales he attempted to persuade the Chinese, then the Japanese, of the truth of his story.One Japanese vit team did pay for a satellite scan of the restricted desert region he had singled out.Detecting nothing, its owners presented the vit teams masters with a bill for costs that they then attempted to pass along to the skinny charlatan who had enticed them with his rousing if outrageous story.He had no better luck with the media in Oceana or Samerica.Exhausted physically, emotionally, and financially, he finally conceded the unlikelihood of convincing anyone other than the usual conspiracy nuts of the truth of his tale.Taking what remained of his gem money he bought a small house in a northern suburb of Manaus on the bank of the Rio Negro.Though even hotter and more humid than Savannah, the landscape and climate were familiar enough that he felt at home.Freed from the need to riffle to support himself, he settled into a life of subdued comfort; not rich but able to buy what he needed if not always what he wished.Beyond his porch, pink dolphins cavorted.Maniped botos towed water skiing tourists up and down the great tributary while magified harpy eagles guided unsteady parasailers over the protected canopy forest that still dominated the far shore.Generating turbines moored deep in the river pumped out power as well as accompanying sonorities that were reprogrammed every week lest the tourists grow bored with repetitive water music that was not by Handel.As the years passed his slender frame shrank in upon itself until age and sun left him resembling a walking stick of beef jerky.Whenever the opportunity arose he would tell his tale to whoever would listen; tourists, children, fellow seniors, workmenanyone who would tolerate the bizarre ramblings of an old Meld.The hundreds, the thousands of messages he sent to media worldwide were treated with universal disdain.Eventually he published the information himself, putting it on the Box for anyone to peruse.Only fools and swindlers responded; the former to expound their own absurd theories, the latter to try to wrest from the crazy old Meld whatever subsist they could scam.The few who commented kindly were notably young and oddly sympathetic.From these he recoiled in increasing horror.Surrounded by the beauty not only of the Brazilian Amazon but Brazilian women, he thought less and less of Dr.Ingrid Seastrom of Greater Savannah.More time fled, more years passed.Decrepitude, even for one who could afford rejuvenating manips, began to press down on him with its inevitable weight.Then one day he had a visitor.Recalling the presence from previous encounters, he remembered Death as being taller.Still stocky, still devoid of expression, but moving with a finesse that belied his age, Napun Mol stood on the porch facing the owner of the little house.Whisprs first thought was to slam the door in the assassins face and make a break for the back room where he kept a small but still functional spray pistol.He had purchased the weapon a number of years ago because of his failing eyesight.It would fire only a few times, but upon discharge the oversized shells would immediately fragment to cover most if not all of a single room.He bought it because it did not have to be aimed.But he knew he wasnt as fast as he used to be, and judging from his looks the even older Mol would be faster still.Whispr could not have outquicked the hired company killer back in the Little Karoo and doubtless he could not outquick him now.He resigned himself.It was not as if he had died young or lived an uninteresting life.Besides, he was tired of looking over his shoulder every time he left the house to go to the market or stroll the riverfront boardwalk.Tired of always searching faces for signs of mind control, or alien eyes, or hidden purposes.So he shrugged and stepped back.Go on.Get it over with.Im pretty much finished anyway.He straightened as much as his narrow aged back would allow.All I ask is that you make it quick.Mol shook his head.Cant do that.She has too much she wants to say.The taller Meld blinked.Say?She?He came forward until he could lean out the door.Mol did not try to stop him.Instead, the assassin moved aside.Bad memories of our previous encounters linger like a wart that refuses to heal.I would very much like to kill you.Instead I was charged with the task of merely locating you again.It was not easy.Mol almost, but not quite, smiled.You are very efficient at covering your tracks.Youre not here to kill me?Regrettably, no.Just to find you.I do what I am paid to do.Personal longing never enters into this work.Although just this once His voice trailed away and he sniffed.A contract is a contract.Turning to his right, he gestured.From behind a guava tree a second figure appeared.Whispr sucked in his breath as she mounted the stairs to his porch.Dr.Ingrid Seastrom did not look as if she had aged at all.She looked, in fact, exactly as she had on the day he had hurried to her office in hopes of getting police traktacs removed from his back.You look Glancing over his shoulder he saw that Mol had turned away from them and was gazing out across the river.Come inside.He closed the door firmly behind them and locked it.She smiled and shook her head.Theres no need for that, Whispr.Mol is as firmly welded to his assignment as an anchor to its ship.He wont bother us.So you work with him now?Though he tried to suppress it he could not quite keep the old cynicism from frothing to the fore.No.She frowned.I dont involve myself with that aspect of the Maturation.If it even exists anymore.My work strictly involves, um, installation.Mind control.He slumped down in a chair woven from plantation liana.She sighed.Its nothing like that, Whispr, but you should already know that.Theres no point in rehashing old arguments.The fingers of his right hand pressing against the angular side of his face, he stared up at her.Why are you heredoc?To have a last laugh at my expense?Because you were right.Nobody believes me when I try to tell them about Nerens and whats going on there.Im just a crazy old man.Living this long is something I never thought Id doespecially after hooking up with you all those years ago.So why not leave me alone?Why not just let me die in peace?He could not keep from staring at her.You look amazing.Advanced alien maniping?She pursed her lips and nodded.Huh.Sold your soul for thirty pieces of silver melding.She rolled her eyes.I work out of Rome now.I had to leave Savannah years ago before people started noticing that I wasnt aging properly, the usual youth melds notwithstanding.I could keep fooling my patients, but not my professional colleagues.Its all right.I always wanted to live and work someplace like Rome.She moved closer and he unwillingly drank in her perfume.Im here to make you an offer.Look at me, he muttered dourly.Im all aquiver with excitement.She smiled anew.Same old Whispr.Listen to me, Archibald Kowalski: youre one of the few humans privileged to have seen the heart of the Maturation.Youve seen ship, space, visitors.Friends.She held up a hand when he started to protest.Youre suffering from advanced melditis and other diseases of aging.Alien biosurge technology can cure you.Make you youthful again.Its not immortality, but itll do until that comes along.Some aliens die at forty.Others live for hundreds of years.There is only so much even they can do with cell manipulation and prosthetic melds.But if you come back to the Namib with me youll live far longer than you will here, and in better health.Ive persuaded the visitors.There are things you can do to help.He stared hard at her out of failing eyes.Thats assuming I want to help.She nodded her understanding.Youre still suspicious.Do you follow the news?Havent you noticed that over the past years there are fewer riots around the world?Fewer serious confrontations?More cooperation.More hope?The changes are slow and incremental, but theyre real, Whispr.The aliens are changing us, and for the better.Each year there are more young people who are a little less afraid of each other.Each year there are more who advance to positions of power, who accept appointments to jobs where they can make a difference.They dont know that theyre doing so, of course.They have no notion that their chemical balance has been altered or that their perception of the world around them has shifted a tiny bit more away from the primitive.She stopped to let him digest what she had said.Isnt that an improvement?Isnt that something worth striving toward?Even if it needs a little bit of a kick start from off world?He sat in the chair and brooded.Outside, a flock of scarlet macaws made its screeching way upriver, trending in the general direction of Colombia.Which way was he trending?He had nothing to look forward to except further gradual creaky decline and eventual death.No friends, no family, and he was nearly out of subsist.He couldnt even riffle anymore.People would laugh at his clumsy efforts if he tried.On the other hand, if he went with Ingrid and cooperated with what she called the Maturation, would he be betraying his own species?Or helping to advance it?There was only one way to find out.Reaching out, he extended a hand.What the hell, mind muffin.I might even learn something.Taking his hand, she helped his frail frame out of the chair and with the same melded strength embraced him tightly.Spindly arms tentatively wrapped themselves around her.That in itself, he decided on the spot, was worth giving in.
