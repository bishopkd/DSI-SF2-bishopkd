We all roared with laughter at that.I watched the dawn.It seemed to me that the dawn was a slightly different colour every day, though Quipu told me I was deluded.I felt a breeze on my cheek.Enjoy your day, I said to Lirilla, as she hovered next to my head, also savouring the dawn, and cooling me with the rapid beating of her multi coloured wings.I shall, Lirilla replied, in a voice so soft it was like a memory distantly recalled.After five hours of cutting and biting with my claws and teeth, I fabricated a perfect stone, and then I carried it on my          back from the quarry to the Temple.The path was long, and winding; I passed herds of grazing creatures dawdling in the fields, savouring the sun on their variously          coloured hides; I skirted the swamplands, where drowsy mud beasts were wallowing, occasionally splashing each other with shit          and mud; and finally I reached the Great Plain, where stood the Temple of the Interior World.It reached, by now, almost to the clouds; a double cylinder 8 shape with oval windows built, brick by brick, out of carved          rock, modelled on a constellation visible from the night skies of my own home planet.The rays of the sun shone down upon          the polished surfaces of the stone; it gleamed white in the soft light, a squat beast with its head striving to angrily butt          the sky.I placed my perfectly shaped stone down on the grass for just one moment, and admired the beauty of the magnificent edifice          we had conceived and built: a doubly circular obelisk set amidst rich grassland, with the snow capped mountains in the distance          peering down at the child of their rocky loins.And I felt proud; just for a moment; the very briefest of moments.And then I clambered up the side of the Temple until I reached the top and levered the stone into position.And I spat the          fast mortar I had been carrying in my mouth into the thick join between stone and stone, to secure the block in place.This trick of mine always annoyed Fray.There were cranes and ramps that were specifically designed to allow workers to raise          up the stone blocks, and hordes of skilful builders of various highly dextrous species standing by to mortar the stones into position.I was, Fray argued, spoiling it for everyone else by showing          off.I did not care; this was one of my rare moments of purely selfish joy.From the top of the Temple I had a perfect high view of my entire world.I savoured it for a while, till Fray screamed at          me to come down and stop being such a forsaken by good manners turd mountain braggart.I visited the prisoner again.He had not eaten, nor had he drunk his water of life.His skin was paler than it had been when          he first joined us.He looked terrible.He wasnt pleased to see me.I watched as Fray ran across the savannah.Her hooves thundered, her vast bulk blurred; she could run faster than any land          animal I knew of on this world.Frays savannah however was small, and not very plausible.When she reached the forest, she stopped abruptly, and tossed her          head, and staggered around in half circles to come to terms with the fact she was no longer running like the wind; and then          she roared to the skies.Lirilla laughed.She hovered next to my cheek, a whirlwind of colour and grace, lit by the sun.Above us, Cuzco was flying loops in the air, with extraordinary grace.Fray snorted, getting ready for another run.Tell that fat fuck, I said to Lirilla, of Fray, that shes a useless lumbering fat fuck.This was a phrase I had learned          from Fray; among her kind it is considered a term of endearment.(Or so I have been led to believe; for it is what she so          very often calls me. )Lirilla vanished, and was back in the beat of a wing.She says that she has seen great steaming mounds of shit more active than you, Lirilla told me.Cruel, I observed.I think she meant it kindly, said Lirilla, anxiously.Tell her, I said, that shes an awkward dim witted loose bowelled cart carrier.And Lirilla vanished; and flew across          the savannah so fast it was as if she were rifting through space; and whispered in Frays ear.From my vantage point, I could          see Fray snort and roar and crash her hooves on the ground.I looked up; Cuzco, the orange bellied giant, was flying on updrafts of warm air, not moving his six wings at all; like a          cloud made of golden armour held up by hope and poetry.And Lirilla was back, whispering in my ear.Watch this, she said, quoting Fray.I saw Fray begin another run across the savannah; hooves pounding; dust rising up in clouds; her ugly ungainly body turned          into pure graceful motion as she traversed the savannah with extraordinary speed.Finally, she came to a halt, steam billowing          off her hide, and pounded her hooves on the ground and stood up on her three back feet and roared.Tell Fray, I said to Lirilla, that for someone who is so clumsy she falls over her own huge tits all the time, that was          not at all bad.Tell me your name.The prisoner shook his head, stubbornly.Three days had passed, and I was making little progress with him.But I was still          patient.It takes time.It always takes time.Tell me your name.My voice was gentle; I was using my sweetest tones to make it clear that I was on his side, and that          I cared.Why are you doing this to me, you bitch from Hell?he said, in calm fearless tones that betrayed his underlying panic.Because I want to be your friend, I said.He blinked.How could that be possible?he said accusingly.You destroyed my entire world!Not I.  They.I am like you.A captive.A slave.He considered this assertion; clearly considering it to be an outrageous lie.You are an evil ugly loathsome vomit inducing monster, he pointed out.Are you telling me my enemies are even worse than          you?I am not, I suggested, so very bad.He stared at me, his angry features trembling.His skin was soft, reddish in hue, marked with diagonal ridges, and it undulated          slightly when he spoke.Youre really not my gaoler?he asked, eventually.No.I replied.You were captured as I was?he said.Indeed.He considered this.If that is so, perhaps I have wronged you, he conceded.It was an easy mistake to make; I just want you to know I am here to help you.Then I thank you for that, he said courteously.So, what is your name?I asked him.They call me, he said proudly, then paused and uttered, as if bestowing a precious gift, his name: Sharrock.And he stared at me, clearly expecting a reaction.In my world, he added proudly, I am But then he broke off, and did not conclude his train of thought.For there no longer was, of course, a his world; and no one would ever again sing songs about him and his heroic exploits,          whatever they might have been.My name is Sai ias, I told him gravely.What language are we speaking?he asked, quietly; his spirits clearly dashed.It is not a language.We are not speaking.Or rather, we speak, but the ship transforms the sounds, via invisible translators          in the air, into patterns of meaning in our minds.The air does that?It does.How is such a thing possible?I do not know, I admitted.And who is in charge?Who controls this ship?Who are our masters?I do not know.How can you not know?I sighed, through my tentacle tips, and patiently explained: I was captured, as you were, by a spaceship.I have never seen my captors.Other slaves explained to me what I had to do,          and how.So you dont know who these creatures are?The ones who destroyed my planet?My people called them Kaun.In my language, that means Feared Ones.What do they call themselves?I dont know.Where do they come from?I dont I get it.You dont know.Have you asked?Did you try to find out?Do you know where on the ship they dwell?Do they look          like you, or like me?What are their intentions?Do they have weaknesses?What is their purpose in attacking worlds like mine?Can we negotiate with them in any way?They dwell in a Tower which no creature can approach.Thats all I know about the Kaun, I said.Sharrock stared at me, intensity building in him like molten rock in a volcano approaching eruption.Then Sharrock, he said, in the tones of a person making a vow that will change his life, will find all the answers to all these questions, and more.And then he shall study the flaws          and weaknesses of these accursed creatures.And then        Then you shall wreak your wrathful vengeance upon the Kaun?I intercepted.Yes, he admitted.And with some chagrin, he said: Youve heard that said before, I take it?I sighed, through my tentacle tips.Many times, I told him.A little while later Sharrock, with heart broken eloquence, told me his tale.The dark and terrible story of the End Of All          Days for his species.He was a brave and proud warrior, he told me, and he came from a brave and proud and noble family.His people were exceptionally          gifted at science and engineering, as well as being courageous fighters.He was, I learned, at some length, incredibly proud          of his people and their status among the other tribes on his planet.He also told me that on his planet there were two biped species living as one family unit: his kind, comprised of warriors          of either gender and their spouses, guided by a Chieftain such as himself, but all equal in law and status; and the three gendered          Philosophers, who were small, tiny tailed creatures of remarkable kindness.The Maxolu warriors, he explained, were as clever as they were brave; and when they werent in combat, or stealing from other          tribes, they were hunters, and farmers, and masters of mathematics and science.The Philosophers, by contrast, knew little of science, and less still of war; but they had the gift of dreaming great things.And out of these dreams, Sharrocks people had created skyships and spaceships and satellites and devices that make it possible          to fly without experiencing the effects of acceleration.I understood very little of all this but I knew it made Sharrock calmer to talk, so I let him talk.Philosophers on his world, he continued, were treated like honoured guests, or small children; they werent expected to work,          or to fend for themselves.All they had to do was dream; and those dreams were inspired, and had yielded an endless succession          of extraordinary inventions and discoveries and concepts.In consequence, his own people were the masters of their solar system,          and also of all the habitable planets within two hundred light years of their sun.I marvelled at the power of their Philosophers dreaming; and it gave me a strong sense of kinship with these now extinct          creatures.For my people too once knew how to dream.Although their technology was advanced, he explained, Sharrocks people were nomads.They lived in tents in the desert for          large parts of the year, and loved to feel the desert sandstorms on their flesh.But even so, their cities were magnificent;          and they could build machines of great complexity that could walk and talk and think, and kill at a distance; or could convey          objects from here to there in less time than the blink of an eye.And they had become, through the manipulation of their own          biology, extremely long lived.Sharrock talked too about the historic rivalry between his people of the North, and the Southern Tribes who had occupied the          equatorial zones and who, after a long battle the details of which held little interest to me, were banished into space, where          they had created an empire of many planets.Shortly before the End of All Days, Sharrock had been on a mission in Sabol, the          capital planet of this empire, a place steeped in luxury and decadence where (as he explained it) fat and effete Southerners          lived inside machines, oblivious to the joys of the natural world.He then explained to me howafter acquiring without purchasing some priceless artefact or other, which now of course was worthlesshe          had returned home to find his village laid waste, and his people dead.He had then, he told me, taken to the sky in some kind of vessel and after various adventures had fought with a large alien          female with red hair streaked with silver.My heart sank when he told me this; I was confident I knew who it was he had fought, and I hoped I would be able to keep the          two of them apart.Sharrock had then been engulfed in lava as the planet began to fall apart; and had lost consciousness, only to wake up inside          the bowels of the Hell Ship, his burned limbs and body miraculously healed.He had subsequently witnessed his planets destruction through the glass walls of the prisoner hold of the Hell Ship; a place          I knew only too well.Trapped and alone, he had seen his sun flaring, like a wounded beast spitting bile and entrails from          its shredded guts; he had seen comets and asteroids crashing into his planets atmosphere; he had seen earthquakes and volcanoes          devastate his world with their hot burning horror; and then he had seen the planet itself break into a million parts like          carved and coloured glass shattered by a blow.The image haunted him, and I understood how he felt.For I, too had seen my world explode into many parts, and the memory          of it has never left me.Let me tell my tale, I said to Sharrock.My kind, I told him, are not warriors.We do notor rather we did nothave weapons.And nor did we believe these creatures          from space would hurt us.By the time we realised our error, our planet itself was in the process of being destroyed; racked          with earthquakes and terrible storms.He listened carefully, but with a certain detachment.It was clear that in his mind what happened to me could not in any way compare to what had happened to him.And I was captured, and held in a spaceship, just as you were, and saw my planet fall into pieces, just as you did.How do they do that?Sharrock asked.The earthquakes?To do that requires a radical sundering of the planets structural          integrity.His features were alert; he was thinking hard now, and it made him look like a hunter eyeing his about to be captured          prey.Bombs fired into the planets core?Missiles made of un matter?I do not know.He nodded, absorbing the sheer depths of my ignorance.I think so, he said.Un matter would do it.You know what un matter          is?No.The opposite of matter; when the two collide, Poof!He clapped his hands, to demonstrate the explosion resulting from the          happening of whatever he was talking about.Or maybe a collapsor sun.You know what that is?A sun so massive it collapses          in on itself?We have no such concept; I have heard talk of such things though, from my friends on this ship, I said.The physics is formidable, said Sharrock, grinning with relish, but the engineering is simple.Put your un matter or your          mini collapsor in a big missile, fire it into the planets crust; set it to detonate when it reaches the liquid outer core.Bang!He clapped his hands; so skilful was his storytelling that I could see the very same image that he was seeing.The planet is gone.Brutal.Our Philosophers have dreamed of such a weapon; but even the Southern Tribes would          not be so entirely fucking evil as to do that.The Kaun, I said, are undeniably that entirely fucking evil.He nodded.Continue, he said, as if I were his servant, and he my king; and I did.My planet was lost to me, I told him, and no more can be said of that.And then I came to the Kaun ship, and I was shocked at what I encountered.I had his attention fully grasped by now; and I needed him to heed these words.For those who do not comprehend how it was          then, cannot exist now.It was, I said, back then, so many years ago, a bleak and barren world.The lake was stagnant, the grasses were knotted          with weeds that stank like corpses.My fellow captives slept outdoors, and every night when the sun was switched off, the          blacker than black night was filled with screaming.For a brief moment, I allowed myself to touch the memory of those days; and it seared my soul.And so I learned, I said, in those early years, the way to survive.And this I must now teach you.You may, said Sharrock, endeavour so to do.The way to survive is this: do not fight.Do not rage.Do not yearn for vengeance.Sharrock smiled; and I recoiled at the power of his hate.How can you say that?Sharrock said scornfully, his skin glowing scarlet, his eyes glittering, his muscles bunched.You          slack cunted bitch!You coward who would comfort his mothers rapist!Vengeance is all there fucking is!No!You must surrender your hate, I said, and my normally gentle tones were strident now.Thoughts of revenge will gain          you nothing; they will merely poison your soul.I knew this well; so very many of my friends had been consumed by hate and          implacable rage.Sharrock thought about what I had said, sifting it like evidence in a murder trial.How can I give up my dreams of revenge?he said, more baffled than angry now.You have to.No!he roared.Remember this, I said, life is worth I dont want to hear your fucking platitudes, you black hided monster!Then I shall cut to the gist of it.To live here, I explained firmly, there are several simple rules that you must follow.Whose rules?Rules we live by.No one tells me, said Sharrock, how to fucking live!Rules you have to live by, I insisted.For know this: you must from this moment on abandon all abstract ideals like freedom and justice          and happiness.These concepts belong to the past; our only future is one of shared regret.And embrace, too, I said, with          a wisdom acquired over aeons,  joy: joy in our world; joy at being alive, and at being together.Each day is precious, to me, and to all of us, for the moments          of joy that it harbours.And I paused, anxious to hear if my logic had prevailed with this arrogant, war mongering fool.And, for a moment, Sharrock did in fact look pensive; he nodded slowly, as if considering my words, and met my gaze calmly.But then Sharrock spoke: You, said Sharrock, in rage filled tones, are nothing but a fucked up the arsehole drinking piss and thinking it tastes like wine          conniving with the enemy and sucking the cock of the creature who killed your mother and your father piece of shit!And I sighed, once more, from my tentacle tips, regretfully.Clearly, my work with Sharrock was far from over.Jak And so, as I have already narrated to you, I left Mohun.And soon afterwards my ship the Explorer 410 slowly accelerated past          the planet of Varth, leaving behind Kawak and his herd of savage predators.I was Master of the Ship, serving under Commander Galamea, and the ships officers included the two Space Explorers I had          met at the banquet, Morval and Phylas.The ship was a small, squat working vessel with a hull streaked with stripes and pock marked with small asteroid scars.The          quarters were basic; I had a cabin smaller than my wardrobe on the Vassal Ship.There was no banqueting dome; we ate in the          canteen, with food malignly designed by the ships computer brain to be nutritious, but not appealing.It was, all in all,          a place of horror.It took a week for Explorer to reach the outer limits of the solar system.Averil would soon depart with the main Trading          Fleet, with her new lover Master Trader Mohun.I thought of her often.In fact, incessantly.Indeed, for every moment of every day, I was haunted with memories of her achingly intellectual features, her lusciously perceptive          smiles, and her casually neglectful glances when I performed for her some great service or other.But I had made my choice: I would lose himself in my work.And I was no more a Trader.My job now was to lead the Explorer          craft into the depths of uncharted space; where, in time hallowed fashion, we would search out new and alien civilisations, in order to get the better of them in sly negotiations.Welcome to my ship, I said to Morval.His old, withered, bald head scrunched up in a scowl more ugly thanwell, I had never seen anything more ugly.I have been on this vessel, he pointed out, for two hundred years.Its my vessel now, I reminded him, courteously.Im aware of that.The scowl became a sneer; hardly an improvement.We should be friends, I told the old Trader generously.I have, as a point of policy, said Morval, no friends.My friends all abandoned me when I was banished by the Chief Artificer.I always admire an Olaran, I said, who can harbour a grudge the way a father raises a child; with love, care, and the passage          of decades.Ah, Master of the Ship your wit is so entirely adequate, said Morval, bitterly.Let me make a wild surmise; you were passed over for promotion?I was.Because of your sullen attitude and melancholic disposition, I suggested.And my abundant lack of youth and beauty.Then clearly, I suggested, I am better qualified; for young I am, barely forty years, and many consider me beautiful.But          you shouldnt in any way feel        This is a godsforsaken Explorer ship!We dont need a pretty boy Master!We need someone who knows what in fucks name hes          doing!And you would be that someone, I take it?I would be, and I am.And Morval stared at me with his dark haunting deep set eyes.The previous Master of the Ship, he          pointed out, died of shock when his simulacrum was eaten alive by sentient slugs, after he and I had spent two years trapped          in an alien forest.Im used to danger.You have no idea, Morval told me, with evident glee, what danger really is.I stood in the bleak, spartan Command Hub of my new ship, with grey walls all around, no porthole, and four brushed Kar goat leather          (I mean the common variety of Kar goat, not the rare beasts with skin like a babys arse) seats for the ships officers and          our Commander.One of these seats was currently occupied by Star Seeker Albinia, who was linked by a cable which stretched          from her shaved head to the ships brain; and hence existed dreamily in a world of her own.Youre used to better, sneered Morval.My Vassal Ship, I said politely, had wooden furniture, shaped and whittled intricately by a Master Carver, and a ships          wheel made of gold and titanium.Frippery!said Morval.Explorer steers the ship, Albinia sees through its eyes; whats a ships wheel supposed to do?It made me feel, I pointed out, important.Phylas grinned at me as if Id made a great joke; he was, I realised, a shameless ingrate.Any chance of a view?I asked, and Morval grunted again, with even greater disapproval.But I glared: Pardon me, direct          order?And he yielded.Albinia, Morval said, give us your eyes.Albinia responded without speaking, and the blank grey wall ahead of me became          a panoramic view of the space outside our ship.Background music?A dark dense thrilling chord pitched at almost subliminally low levels filled the small cabin; that, and the stars, gave the          spiritless space at least some sense of atmosphere.Morval grunted and scowled, clearly caught up in a crescendo of disapproval, but I ignored him.My bunk, I said to Phylas, who stood shyly beside me, is it considered acceptable on such vessels?It is the largest bunk on the ship.Except for the female quarters.Phylas snorted with amusement.Except, obviously, for the female quarters.What is the Commander like?I said.Give me fair warning.Is she firm?Fair?Disciplined?She is fierce.Ah.Fierce.She is a former Admiral in the Olaran Navy; she was discharged for excessive, um, brutality.Against who?Against the Stuxi.The Stuxi, I pointed out, tried to destroy our home world; they were flesh eating savages who murdered millions before          we forced them into a truce.Even so, a military tribunal found her too brutal.Ah.I believe also that she considers me an idiot, Phylas admitted.And does she have grounds for that?Occasional comments of mine have not always, um, accorded with common sense.You really are, I said kindly, a child, arent you?Aye Master.Morval.Tell me about the ship.What weapons do we have?Six gen guns; twelve light cannons, three negative matter transporters, and a disruptor ray, Morval said.Engine capacity?Four point two kais.With booster engines, and stay still wraparounds.In a crisis, we flee to the nearest rift and escape.Morvals tone was brisk now; when it came to the business of the ship, he clearly knew his stuff.Show me how the stay still does its job.Phylas conjured up his phantom controls, and pressed an oval; and our three bodies shimmered as the inertial haze surrounded          us.Then Phylas pressed another oval and the ship suddenly flipped over.Albinia of course was strapped to her seat; but Phylas,          Morval and myself remained hovering in air, in the same position, though we were now upside down in relation to the Hub floor          and control rigs.Phylas pressed a third oval and we were right way up.An alternative, he said, to seat harnesses.Seat harnesses have always worked for me, I said testily.I find, said Morval, they chafe.Phylas pressed the oval again.The ship flipped again.I was upside down, again.Oh, boy, I said, delighted.Initiate the space drive, said Commander Galamea.We were ready to rift, and Commander Galamea had joined us in the Command Hub.She had made no comment about the wrap around          space panorama that now dominated this small room, but had quietly asked Albinia to cut the background music.Galamea was a lean, strongly muscled female; her eyes burned with a blue light that betrayed many years in rift space; she          did not look as if she knew how to smile, nor did it seem likely she would welcome instruction in that art.I am proud to serve, o exalted mistress, I said.Just Yes Commander will do, Galamea said tersely, and I recalled how the military hate any display of courtesy and eloquence.Yes, exalted Commander, I replied.Disreality is achieved, Commander, said Morval.The slippery sands of chaos envelop us, said Phylas.Explorer is content, said Albinia, dreamily.The cable that connected her to Explorer hung loosely out of her shaved head;          her eyes were closed; her mind entirely in tune with the ships computational brain.She was, I noted in passing, the most          ravishingly clever looking Star Seeker I had ever seen.On my phantom controls, I could see that we were getting random readings across all vectors, as a consequence of the flux          of chaos being generated.A certain amount of time elapsed, but no one knew how much, or whether it was a longer or shorter passage of time than usual.A rift has emerged, said Phylas eventually.I see it, I said authoritatively, though in fact I saw nothing; just a jumble of incomprehensible graphs and equations on          my phantom control screen.Can we predict the destination?Albinia moaned, as she tried to analyse the data flux and find some notion of what lay beyond the rift in time and space.No, Albinia eventually concluded.Morval?asked Commander Galamea.I see no trace of disruptive nothingness, Morval said, slowly reading the data on his phantom control screen as if was a          novel of which he was savouring the sentence structure.(In passing, I marvelled at the nerve of the man; pretending he understood the data!)Phylas?The ships engines are showing no potential signs of imminent spontaneous detonation, said Phylas, comfortingly.I looked at Commander Galamea as she made her decision.She was pensive, almost absent minded.Finally, she nodded her assent.Travel through rifts via disreal projection was a hazardous business; we all needed a few          moments to prepare for the possibility of never becoming our actual selves again.I took her nod as my instruction.Proceed with space leap, I instructed.Phylas moved the sliders on his phantom controls; the ships drive was restarted; the disreality beams were dimmed.And the          Explorer flewinstantly, so fast that it arrived before it left, almost through a rift in space.As we flew, the Command Hub tilted violently, first this way, then that, until we all were all upside down relative to the          harnessed Albinia and the Hub itself.But the stay still fields kept our bodies immune to the effects of violent oscillation,          and the phantom control displays patiently followed us to our new positions.Albinia moaned with joy as she entered the rift; and I knew that she could sense, with every part of her skin and body, what          it was to be not real.And even we, who did not have her direct access to Explorers sensors, could feel the strangeness of the moment.We emerged from the rift.Morval assessed the data on his screen.We arenowhere, he said.No traces of organic life, Phylas confirmed.No habitable planets, Morval added.Albinias eyes snapped open.Explorer, she said, hates this place.Try again, said Galamea.Reduce our probability once more, I said tensely.Yes, Master, said Albinia, and closed her eyes again.A few moments of idle nothing passed; I yearned to have my ships wheel back.There was no romance in pressing ovals on an          illusory screen.Then I felt the strangeness come upon me again.Probability is reducing, Master of the Ship, said Phylas, reading the data off his screen.And reducing more.And more.And more, Phylas added.I knew, though I did not fully comprehend, that the universe is a rocky reality built upon slippery sands of disreality; this          was the heart and truth of Olaran science.And only the Olaraor strictly speaking, the Olara women knew how to control this process.And so, whilst remaining motionless, Explorer began the long process of reducing its own likelihood, until the new rift appeared,          and had been, and was, and will be again.(Though all this made much more sense in mathematical form, so I am reliably informed. )And thus Explorer vanished, and reappeared elsewhere; and the ships computational mind swiftly calibrated where it was this time.Again we detected no traces of life; the process recommenced; Explorer vanished, and reappeared, a million light years further          on; and then did so again.We were taking our ship out, far out, into regions of space never yet charted.We have a possible trace of organics, Master of the Ship, said Morval, eventually, and the ship halted and its probability          rose.All of us on the Hub forced vomit back down our throats; the stay still wraparounds werent that good.Let us proceed, I said calmly, and the ships true engines fired up, and Explorer began its slow journey towards its destination.Albinia was communing deeply with Explorer.Her eyes were closed; her expression rapt.She was lost in a whirl of data from          sensors that could perceive the mass and chemical constitution of stars a million baraks from here, and could feel like a          touch of skin on skin the crash of microparticles against her ships hull.It felt wrong to stare at her; a violation, like watching a lover asleep.But yet I continue to gaze; I could not stop myself.For whenever Albinia was in her trance, she had a beauty of mind and spirit that haunted me.Her eyes twitched under closed          lids, her lips moved involuntarily.Her face flickered constantly with emotionfear, regret, anticipation, joy.She was, in a word: sublime.Were here, said Phylas.Ease her out, I said.We have readings from six separate planets, said Morval.This culture has colonised its entire planetary system, but their          main focus is on Planet Five, the gas giant.No traces of shifting sands scars.Their Fields of Force signature is sixty three          point four.A nuclear haze, theyre a messy bunch.Albinia, I said.Her eyes flickered and then opened.She took a gasp.Am I done?Albinia asked.Youre done, I said softly.Good, said Albinia briskly, and her face was a neutral mask again.I retreated at the touch of her inner authority.We think theyre pre interstellar, recovering from a relatively recent nuclear war, said Phylas.What will we call them?asked Albinia.Morval?He clicked an oval.The next name on the list, he said, is Prisma.Then Prisma it is.Explorer doesnt like them, Albinia said.Why not?I asked.She didnt say.I just felt it.She fears this place, and these people.Theyre primitives, teased Phylas.What is there to fear?Primitives, Morval reminded him, once obliterated all of Caal, and all eleven Trader ships in the area.We would never be, said Phylas arrogantly, so easily duped.Explorer glided through space, propelled by sub atomic interactions in seventh dimensional geometry, or some such thing; the          truth is, I can never recollect the detail of these tedious technical matters.The light from the system sun made the ships          hull glow; I admired the image of our ship haloed with radiance on my panoramic wall screen.Explorer passed a pock marked asteroid.This solar system was, I noted, quite beautiful.There were brightly coloured gas giants with multiple rings, comets with          tails, and from our angle of approach we could see all seven planets of the system in a single gaze, clustered like a family          of unruly children of every different size and age.There is nothing finer, or so I thought then, than the moment of initial approach; that first glimpse of an alien stellar          system, with no hint as to what might lie within.Our gen guns are being charged, said Phylas matter of factly.For a moment I didnt take in his words.Then: What?I said, startled.The ship is taking evasive action, Phylas explained.Oh by all thats joyous, Morval muttered to himself, this Master of the Ship has no idea.Cease, I barked at the old man, sarcasming.I could see, on the panoramic wall screen, that Explorer was now weaving and zagging through space, in bewildering randomised          patterns.I was uncomfortable.It was proper protocol for the Ships Master to be informed in advance of all decisions made by the vessels          computational mind; but on this occasion I was being ignored.For a moment, I felt a surge of annoyance; for in truth, I hated being sidelined like this.I understood of course that my          role as Master was largely ceremonial; and that all major decisions were made by the Mistress Commander and the Star Seeker and the          ships computational brain.But this was an ugly reminder of a truth I generally preferred to, well, ignore.However, I hid my irritation between a mask of bonhomie, charm, and self deprecating wit; as I always do.Why?I asked courteously, with my favourite irresistible smile, are we doing all this?Missiles have been launched by Explorer; power beams are being fired by Explorer; the intended target is the asteroid, said          Phylas, ignoring my question.Yes but why?Youll find out, said Morval with grim pleasure, soon enough.I followed the progress of the attack on the wall screen: our ship in space, the orb of the planetary moon looming before          us; the flaring colours of the gen gun missiles, and the pillars of energy from the light cannons arcing a slow progress towards          the asteroid.It was a stately dance of colour and light set against a black cloth of night.I assumed that the enemy were attempting to attack us; but Albinia had still told me nothing.Her lips moved silently as she          and Explorer waged space war.I was tense; for the truth was, I had never been quite so close to combat before.In all the battles in which I had played a role, I had been part of the rapidly fleeing Trader          fleet, protected by Navy and Explorer vessels.Now, I was in the front line and I could die.I saw, on the screen, our missiles flying closer and closer to the asteroid.While, on my phantom control display, a bewildering          series of graphs and equations flashed before my eyes, though I had no idea what meanings they conveyed.Now, said Morval, somehow managing to guess what was about to occur.And at just that moment, the asteroid erupted.And a flock of black triple horned warcraft emerged from it, hurtling towards          us.Two hundred and forty two enemy drone missiles, said Phylas.The radiation trail indicates dirty nuclear bombs, added Morval.Theyre attacking us!I summarised, in a cheery fashion; playing the fool with my usual panache.Forgive me, said Albinia, dreamily.I thought it better to act first, and inform you of my decisions later.Very wise, beloved Mistress, I said generously, concealing my anger.Sarcasming is not a word, Morval reminded me, with his usual long memory.It has a ring to it, I said defensively.Commander Galamea arrived on the Hub, in a blaze of implicitly rebuking the rest of us for being so lazy energy.Master of the Ship, report!she barked.Morval, brief the Commander please, I said, sneakily.Explorer seems to have detected an imminent attack, we have no more data, said Morval, which irked me, because I could have          said that much.Albinia groaned, lost in communion with Explorer.And, just as the last of the enemy drones emerged from the artificial asteroid, Explorers missiles began to silently detonate.It was like a birthday sky fire display against the blackness of space.Moments later, a haze appeared on the screen; and the enemy drones began to slowly fall apart, like dancers breaking away          from a tableau into separated solos.There were no subsequent explosions as these craft broke up; these were merely objects          sundering into their myriad pieces as if changing their minds about existing.I realised that our gen gun missiles were not just kinetic, they also harboured atom disruptor particles.The snarling swarm          of enemy drone bombs were being destabilised at sub atomic level.What information do we have about this civilisation?asked the Commander.Hostile?guessed Morval.Type 3, post nuclear, pre shiftingsands, the home planet is the gas giant fifth from the sun but they also inhabit five other          planets and twelve satellites and those comets are in fact space stations with tails, said Albinia, with her usual calm dreamy          certainty.Explorer is preparing to fire again, said Morval.And thin rays of energy erupted once more from the gen gun tubes.And before long, the panoramic wall screen showed nothing but empty space, and the faint wisps of former menace that was all          that remained of the enemy fusillade.See this, said Morval, somehow once again miraculously anticipating the action.A juggernaut of a spaceship was emerging from the hollow asteroid.It was clearly expecting an easy passage behind its escort          of killer drone bombs.Instead, it was met with a withering hail of destructive energy from Explorer.The juggernaut shimmered,          like a firebird on a midsummer night about to explode; then abruptly dematerialised.And I looked at Morval, puzzled.How did he manage, time and again, to predict so accurately what was going to happen?Explorer glided deeper into the stellar system, until it reached planet Five, the home of these unpleasant sentients.It was a gas giant, with six natural rings and a larger artificial ring which Explorer identified as a space defence system.And there we waited.We had already demonstrated that we (or rather Albinia in communion with Explorer) had powers beyond          the imagining of these beings.The rational response would be for them to surrender unconditionally, in the hope of averting further fatalities.That seemed, however, unlikely.I reclined in my Masters chair, watching it all on the wall screen.How many times, I asked Phylas, do the wretched aliens          try to kill you when you appear?Always.Not always, corrected Morval.There was that time That was a feint.They greeted us in peace, and ambushed the Traders a century later.How did you know I always know what you will say, said Morval.Phylas glowered; hurt at being shut out from his own conversation.Commander Galamea prowled the deck.Explorer, progress report, said Galamea.Wait and see, said Albinia dreamily.We waited.And then an image appeared on our panoramic wall screen; Albinia had made contact with the aliens leader.He was a squat,          asymmetrical, slimy and undeniably ugly creature, with no visible eyes and a mouth that went up instead of across.Greetings, I said.Explorer had of course been intercepting all the radio traffic from these creatures since we arrived          in their system, and had gathered enough information about their language to run a translation facility.You speak language our, growled the alien.Apparently not that well, I conceded.We come in peace, and so forth; and we wish to trade.You kill have of hundreds our people, said the alien.Albinia, I snapped.Give us time; their language has a weird syntax, Albinia said defensively.We did not destroy your warriors and their spaceship, I explained carefully.We have merely concealed them in another dimension,          from which we can retrieve them easily if you prove you are peaceful.And now we wish to negotiate.You hold people our hostage!roared the alien.Indeed we do.Smart is thinking, said the alien, evidently reassured.Down welcome planet ours.I would be delighted, I said.Our landing craft emerged like a child being birthed from the hull of Explorer, and rocket propelled across the expanse of          open space.The shadow selves of Albinia and I sat side by side in the cockpit and watched the view.I was close enough to          smell her skin, and hear her breath, if she had been possessed of skin and breath.It occurred to me that I had certain clandestine personal reasons for wanting Albinia on this mission with me; and I was delighted          at my own unsuspected subterfuge.Our craft reached the outer atmosphere of the bright purple gas giant; and we looked down at the swirling winds below.Are you still inhabiting Explorer?I asked Albinia.Yes.Whilst operating the simulacrum.Yes.And do you have, perhaps, enough reserves of consciousness remaining to engage in idle chat?No.As I feared.The landing craft descended; we were held in position by our stay still fields, as the vessel rocked and shook.The hull was          being buffeted by powerful gales and seared with toxic gases, but the crafts force mantle protected it entirely.The electronic eyes on the crafts hull looked deep into the wild screaming          madness of the atmosphere, and Albinia saw it all too.How do they endure this place?I marvelled, using a murmur link to connect directly to Albinia.It is, strangely, magnificent, Albinia said and smiled.And then the smile faded and she was, once more, off in a world of her own, barely aware of me.I looked at the view from my tiny porthole, a maelstrom of heat and burning gases, and I felt nauseous.Outside the craft,          the pressure was so great it would crush a space suit and condense an Olaran body to the size of a crumb, if we had been so          foolish as to go for a walk.Thus, through air as thick as ice, we fell downwards, until, finally, we were in the midst of the alien flock.These creaturesthe Prismaswere spawned of gas and plasma, yet somehow (the physics entirely eluded me) nevertheless existed          in squat asymmetrical solid and eyeless form that could survive without a spacesuit in the atmosphere of a gas giant.According to Phylas, these strange beings could act like sunscreating metals out of their own substance, and then weaving          them into spaceships.Thus, their drone ships were spawned like eggs; and their missiles were not mere artefacts, they were          in effect, cells discharged from the Prisma host bodies.Can understand us you?said a voice over our radio net.I looked outside the porthole; and I could see a hundred Prismas          hovering in the air like fat turds with mouths all around us.This was as near as our species could get to each other; the          Prismas could not survive in our atmosphere; and we would not be able to see or hear a thing in their atmosphere.So we would have to talk to them from within the landing craft.Yes we can, I said, peering out and wondering which Prisma I was talking to.Living are creatures you?We are living creatures.You travelled space have?Through.We have travelled through space.Whole tendrils of a are you?We are not tendrils of a whole; we are the whole.We are creatures of flesh and blood.We do not exist as you do, as creatures of gas and, er, stuff.Impossible.It is possible.There are many varied kinds of life.Rocks are you.Excreta are you.Are worthy not to talk with us.We have to talk with you.We owe you this.Where is the planet from which you come?said the Prisma.Our translator was, I noticed with some relief, finally getting          the hang of the creatures syntax.Far far away.You cannot reach it.Can it be inhabited by our kind?You cannot reach it.It can be inhabited by our kind?No, and you cannot reach it.You have no idea who we are.We are the most powerful and fearsome creatures in all the universe.You are, I thought to myself, a bunch of arrogant fucks; and then I realised my murmur talk device had translated this into          speech.I switched off my communicator and turned to Albinia.What do you think?Something is happening.What?I dont know.Something.I turned on my communicator and spoke again to the Prisma: We are here to trade; do you understand that concept?You have come from far away; how?What ships do you possess?Are you long lived?We give you a thing; you give us a thing.Its called trade.Do you understand this concept?We have sent spaceships into farthest space; they have never returned.Can you explain this?Well, its a dangerous universe out there.We are the most fearsome species in existence; no harm could come to creatures such as us.Our voyagers were told to conquer          and destroy and then return to fetch us.That was ten thousand years ago; and they are late.And we are full of wrath.Albinia and I exchanged glances; this wasnt looking too promising.Be that as it may, I continued to the Prisma, lets talk a bit more about this concept of trade.You see, I continued, getting into the swing of it now, you have the ability to create metal artefacts with the power of          your thoughts, and we could maybe sell stuff like that.Whereas we        Perhaps the journey was too long, and they died.We long to travel swiftly among the stars, rather than being trapped at          sub light speeds.Can you do that?Journey faster than light?We can.Can you teach us how?We could certainly give you some hints, I temporised.Then we can trade,  said the Prisma.Albinia patted my arm.I switched off my communicator.Yes?Firstly, these creatures are a bunch of dangerous fucking lunatics, she pointed out, quite accurately.Secondly, Im detecting          some kind of weapon.Dont know what.It involves the planet, and the sun, and a fleet ofsomething nasty.I think theyre          aiming to attack Explorer again.What should I do?I asked her, for though I was Master of the Ship, I trusted her judgement totally.She thought, for a brief moment, with her merged with Explorer face, then a cold look came upon her.Theyre bastards; lets fuck em, she said.And so we fucked em.I triggered the self destruct switch.And our landing craft exploded; and obliterated into particles so small they could not be assimilated by the Prismas.And then a searing wave of heat from the explosion ripped through the alien creatures, sundering them into a billion wave lets.And thenas I was later toldin orbit above the planet, the Prisma battle fleet emerged from the shadow of their moon and          launched a massive attack upon Explorer.At the same time, Prisma drone ships leaped from hiding places amidst the gas giants rings and rained missiles and heat energy          upon Explorer, drenching its forcefields.However, Explorers shields deflected the enemys beams and missiles with ease; and it then counter attacked, using its disruptor          ray at full capacity; and the entire Prisma fleet was obliterated in an instant.And all that was left was a swirl of random atoms in space.For such is the power of Olara; we do not seek war, but when we fight, we always win.At about this time, I woke up on my simulacrum bench.And I staggered to my feet and saw that Albinias skin was close to          burning point; steam was rising from it.The simulated experience of being burned alive on the planet was manifesting as actuality          on her real body.I doused her with cooling spray, just as she woke up, and screamed with agony.Then I cradled her, as Phylas entered.He turned ashen at the sight of Albinia.Shell be fine, I snapped.It had been my idea to take Albinia with me on this mission; but to risk the life of a Star Seeker          was, in retrospect, a reckless and a foolish thing.I knew it myself, and I desperately hoped no one would be vulgar enough          to tell me so.I carried Albinia to the sick room and placed her in healing stasis.Then I returned to the Hub.Whats happening?asked Commander Galamea.Explorer isnt moving.I am notwell, said Explorer, forlornly, via our murmur links.Manual operation, I said, and spoke directly to Explorer: Your human half is unconscious.She has been injured.Seal the          system.Injured, how?said Explorers voice.Psychosomatic sympathetic burns.We died, down there, and we felt it here.Your fault, said Morval, cruelly.You jeopardised the life of our Star Seeker.You I should have known it would be him.Explorer: these are my instructions, I snapped.Bomb the gas giant, kill as many of those ugly big parent fuckers as you          can.Then seal the system.Get us out of here.I need to Commander Galamea said.DO IT NOW, I screamed, and Explorer heard my voice of command, and on the wall screen I saw plumes of cloud start to emerge          from the gas giant.Teleported bombs were exploding on the planets surface.Explorer accelerated; but the stay still fields were not in place so we were scattered like ritsos, and I flew across the          room and crashed into Commander Galamea.We gripped each other, just as the stay still came on; and for a few awkward moments          we were held aloft in each others arms, as if swept up by an imaginary wind.Then Explorer slowed down, and the stay still fields were released, and we dropped to the ground like stones off a bridge.The Commander and I staggered to our feet, bruised by each others bodies.Then, carefully avoiding eye contact, we studied          the panoramic image around us of the stellar system of the Prismas.Show the barrier in false colour, I said, and Explorer changed the screens so that they revealed the shape of the invisible          barrier in space that now encaged the Prismas; a shifting sands wall that would trap the Prismas, irrevocably and for all          eternity, in this little bubble of space.Galamea whispered to me: You were wrong, of course, to take Albinia.I nodded, to acknowledge that I knew she was right.Nevertheless, Galamea said, that was a good first mission.You were fair, but decisive.They were a bunch of evil bastards!I said angrily.No, said Galamea, kindly.Not evil, not bastards; these are aliens.We cant judge them by our own ethical and cultural          standards.Even the Stuxi?Galamea thought about that.Actually, they really were evil bastards, she admitted.Later, I recorded the summary in my log for the mission: No potential for trade.Danger Rating 4.Alien hostiles Quarantined, in perpetuity.Later still, I went to visit Albinia in the sick room.Her flesh had peeled off, she looked like a corpse.But she was awake.She fixed me with a scornful glance; there was no trace of the absent, dreaming Albinia.This was a cold hard woman, looking          at me as if I was a nobody.I apologise, I said, for your pain.Her raw skin twitched, which I took to be a sneer.It was my decision; it is my pain; do not presume to pity me, Albinia          told me coldly.Yes Star Seeker, I said, and my dawning love for her received a brutal jolt.And thus the months passed, and then the years.I remember that period fondly now, as a kind of golden age.Though at the          time it seemed to be mostly drudgery and terror, alternating with moments of love sick anxiety.So many missions.So many evil aliens!So many unscrupulously bargained contracts of trade!That was my life, the all of my life, before it changed.Before the events that But no.Im getting ahead of myself.Are you sure theres life down there?I said sceptically, looking at the panoramic wall screen image of the slime covered          festering oozing planetary surface that was beneath us.Explorer says yes, said Albinia.All right then, I said.Phylas, suit up; and lets get going.Our shadow selves materialised in a field of green grass.The sun beat down upon us.Nice weather, said Phylas, cheerily, and I shot him a filthy look.Phylas, I had learned during our many missions together,          was possessed of the boundless optimism of the utterly stupid; his navety was almost as vexing to me as was Morvals bleak          melancholy.There are storms, Albinia/Explorer informed us.A six legged faun sauntered up to us, and nuzzled me with its snout.I patted it; and it was soft and warm to the touch.And my mood mellowed.Phylas was grinning still, yet it no longer irked me.Indeed, I ventured a grin of my own, which he          easily outmatched.I like this place, I told Phylas.Phylas laughed out loud.Indeed so!It reminds me, he said.Of what?Of when I was a boy.My father used to take me hunting.Wed shoot our native grazing animals with a home made bow and arrow.It was a rite of passage; I was born on the planet of Darox, you know.We had our own        I realised that Phylas was now holding a wooden bow, and a quiver full of feathered arrows; a highly unexpected shadow self          conjuration on his part, or so I mused.This is meant to be, I pointed out, a serious mission.Live a little!said Phylas.I envied him his youth and his foolishness.And I wondered, where had each of mine of those gone?You need to move out of that swamp, said Albinia.Theres a strong probability that the sentients are located in the hills above you.Swamp?Phylas drew back the arrow, as the faun skittered away.His aim was true; the arrow took the beast through the neck and it          fell.I stumbled backwards, towards the river.A narrowboat drifted past me, with my beloved Shonia on board, in a beauteous white          robe.I blinked.Dream of me!my first true love cried.I tried to speak, in order to summon Albinias help; but my vocal cords were frozen.I blinked again.Its exquisite, said Phylas, as we walked through the palace, admiring the gem studded walls and the rich hangings and the          seductive beauty of the incense fumes in the air.It reminds me, I said, searching for the memory.Ah glory, said Phylas, for a harem of radiantly intelligent Olaran females were now approaching us.They were clad in robes          as rich asas        I took out my knife and I severed Phylass throat.Then I thrust the blade through my own forehead, so it impaled my brain          and severed my        [I awoke on the couch, with a blinding headache.Explorer began recalibrating my connection with my shadow self but] I bit my finger and screamed with pain, and lunged off the couch.I ripped the contacts off my skull and body.And I stood          there panting.Then I looked to Phylas.He had sunk back into his shadow self; so I brutally ripped the contacts off him and he screamed          and looked at me.Bliss!he roared.Illusion, I pointed out.We staggered up to the Command Hub.Albinia had already surmised that this was a planet inhabited by telepathic slime; Explorers instruments informed us that          this continent wide intelligence was able to manipulate the thoughts, emotions and sensations of all who walked through its          muddy oozing bogs.Why didnt you rescue us?I accused.You looked as if you were having, said Albinia, fun.I wrote up the experience in my log, and concluded: No potential for trade: Danger Rating 3: System Quarantined; review in 100 years.Commander Galamea was curt, and clearly angry with me, I did not know why.Set course, she said, and Albinia sank into a trance like state.Phylas and Morval attended to their phantom control displays.I realised that the Commanders skin was pinking; and it dawned on me that she was in heat.Commander, I said softly.She glared at me.If you need any I hinted.What?Help?She glared even more.Help with what?If your mood is I realise that when a female is Her glaring intensified.You want to fuck me?she asked, savagely.If you need me to, I said helpfully, I will never, Galamea said, need a male ever again!Her body was trembling with repressed passion; I was awed at the strength of will she was displaying in refusing my offer.And baffled, too; for all she had to do was indicate her sexual state, and all of us males would do our duty.Grudgingly, perhaps; but even so!So what, I wondered, made her so bizarrely reluctant to ask?We shadow suited up, Galamea and I.  I had a bad feeling about this.But it was the Commanders idea; she wanted to experience a mission with me.I lay down on the shadow couch.I closed my eyes.And then I opened my eyes and found myself standing on a planet full of dark gloom.I could hardly see my way to walk.Galamea switched on her helmet torch and we made our way through a dense mass of pointed stakes.This was, I realised, a field          of sorts.The nest is to your left, six thousand baraks, said Albinia/Explorer.Why the darkness?I thought it was daytime, Galamea asked.I have no data on that.Are there thick clouds?I have no data on that.My shadow feet left no tread; but my motion must have triggered a trap.A stake impaled my body, from my arse to my scalp.I tried to wriggle free.Split yourself, said Galamea bluntly.I cant.Split yourself!I split my body in half and Galamea picked up the pieces and stuck them back together.My shadow self reformed.Here, said Albinia/Explorer, and I switched on my own helmet torch and the field was illumined.We saw around us leafless trees          haunted by shadows.The shadows were the nocturnals who were the primary sentient species on this planet.The secondary sentients          were trees and our chances of trading with them were approximately low to zero.Do you have any concept, Galamea said to me, in quiet tones, as we were waiting for the shadows to approach.Of what, Commander?Of how it feels.To have no power over your body.I do not follow.Last week.When I was in heat.You so courteously offered to fornicate with me.When I was, as you were aware, in heat.I would have been privileged to assist you, Commander, I said, cautiously.I had never been spoken to so candidly by a female          before about this delicate matter.Even my lovers had never referred to the monthly imperative of their biology, except in          terms of their needing it, and needing it now.I did not want you to do so, Galamea said bluntly.I meanwhat Im trying to say here Master of the Ship Jakis that I          didnt want you to fuck me, at such a time, and in such a way.I was piqued at that.Why not?I asked.Because I dont want to be, she pointed out, with anger modulating her normally calm tones, just an animal.Unable to control my brute lust.Nor frankly do I savour your selfless pathetic obedience.We need to be more than prisoners          of our own biology, Jak!We havedont we seethe potential to be so much more!Whatever you say, Commander, I said, my casual tone belying the fact I was affronted at her words.Pathetic?Obedient?Was that really how she saw me?Do you have the faintest idea what Im saying?she asked me, sadly.Not really, I admitted Then forget we had this conversation.Its forgotten.The shadows lifted from the trees and hovered above us.A slow hissing sound surrounded us.Can you translate?Galamea asked Albinia.Not yet.We waited patiently for Explorer to decode the linguistic patterns in these creatures malign hissing.Are these shadowy bastards a hive intelligence?I asked.I have no data on that, said Albinia/Explorer.The shadows hovered high, and when I looked up at them, at the black clouds that blocked the sun, I realised that the clouds          were moving.These creatures block their own sun, I told Albinia/Explorer.We stood in that field for fourteen hours, but Explorer never managed to decode the aliens strange hissing language.And so the system was abandoned, but not quarantined.The mission was a failure.But Galameas words stayed with me.And many years later, after she was dead, it occurred to me what she had really been saying that day in the field of trees          and shadows.She had been asking me to change.To stop serving her blindly; to cease treating her with craven adoration; to treat her, in short, as an equal.All this,          I eventually realised.Too late.Sai ias Where are you talking me?Not far.My cabin is here.Down the corridor, I said.Sharrock stepped anxiously along the circular corridor, struggling to keep his balance because of the steepness of the slope.The corridor was large enough to accommodate my bulk and that of Cuzco and the other giant sentients, as we are called.Sharrock was dwarfed by it, like an insect clambering across the hide of a huge and grossly fat land animal; or, indeed, like          Lirilla dancing upon the backside of Fray.He slipped, and fell, and scrambled back to his feet.Take care, I advised him.I tripped, he said angrily, on that fucking slime trail you leave wherever youve fucking been.It is an outpouring of my essence, not a fucking slime trail,  I told him stiffly.You fucking corpse fucking slime leaving freak, Sharrock sneered.I slithered on.The circular tunnel expanded into a large circular atrium, and I spoke the code and a door opened in the wall.
