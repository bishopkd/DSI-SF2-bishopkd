He had to fight to keep himself from pounding on the nearest wall, screaming to be let out.Its just an airlock, he repeated to himself, over and over They cant let me out until its filled with air.Just a few minutes  It seemed like an hour.He found out, later, that it was really forty two seconds.Then a green light glowed in the darkness.He lunged toward it, felt the wheel of the door seal, wrenched it open, and tumbled into light, warmth, and  AIR!He twisted his helmet off, and inhaled a reek of rancid food, unwashed body, and a sanitation recycler that wasnt quite working right.They were the sweetest scents hed ever smelled.A chime rang behind him.He whirled about to see an amber light blinking next to the airlock.Of coursenobody else could come in until he shut the inside hatch!He slammed and dogged it shutand realized hed been hearing voices as soon as hed come in; they were just now beginning to register.Consarn it, taint none of my affair!a gravelly voice ranted.Now you turn this blasted tub around and get back to my claim!But under the Distressed Spacers Law, a calm, resonant voice replied, you are required to render assistance to the crew of any imperiled ship.Youve said that fifteen times, hang it, and Ive given you fifteen good reasons why we shouldnt!Three, the calm voice reminded, five times each, and none of them sufficient.Any of ems good enough!Taint none of our businessthats the best one of all!Dar finished shucking out of his space suit and racked it, then tiptoed along the companion way toward the voices.Totally inadequate, the other voice answered, unruffled.The Distressed Spacers Law specifically mentions that a distressed spaceman is the overriding concern of any who happen to be near enough to offer assistance.Overriding was the key word; it made Dar suddenly certain as to who the calm voice belonged to.He peeked around the edge of the hatchway, and saw the burro boats cabin, a cramped space littered with ration containers and papers, dirty laundry, and smudges of oil and grease.It held two acceleration couches, a control console with six scanner screens, and a short, stocky man in a filthy, patched coverall, with matted hair and an unkempt, bushy beard.Jettison the law!he yelled.Common sense oughta tell you that!Its the Patrols job to take care of a shipwreck!Which was your second reason.The calm voice seemed to come from the control console.The crew of the ship in question might be those whom the Patrol was pursuing.If they was, bad cess to em!Damn telepaths, poking their noses into other peoples secrets!Who do they think they are, anyway?Human beings, the voice answered, and as much entitled to life as anyone elseespecially since the Patrol has apparently not accused them of any crimes.Dar decided he liked the unseen owner of the calm voice.Bein a telepaths a crime, damn it!Dont you follow the news?Only insofar as it is logicalwhich is to say, not very far at all.I fail to comprehend how a person can commit a crime by being born with an extra ability.Neither did Darand it was definitely news, at least to him.Just how powerful were the people involved in the plot to overthrow the I. D. E. , anyway?Apparently, powerful enough to whip up a full scale witch hunt, just for the purpose of catching his humble self.He realized the implications, and felt his knees dissolve.Taint fer you or me to understand itthe government does, and thats enough.Whatyou figger youre smarter than the Executive Secretary and all them Electors put together?Suddenly, Dar realized why the plot had gotten as far as it had.The old man sounded more like a medieval serf than a well informed citizen of a democracy.A hand fell on his shoulder, and Sam snarled in his ear, I didnt think youd sink so low as to listen at keyholes.Dar looked up, startled; then he smiled.Of course I havent.Thats why I left the door open.That depends on your definition of intelligence, the calm voice answered.What difference does it make?the old man howled.You cant vote, anywayyoure just a damned computer!Computers do not have souls, the voice said complacently, and therefore cannot be damned.Kicked into the mass recycler, then!Do you realize how much money youre losing me, by kiyoodling off to rescue these garbage can castaways?Sams lips drew into a thin hard line.She took a step toward the door.Dar grabbed her shoulder, hissing, Not yet.Perfectly, the computer answered, since this is the sixth time youve mentioned the fact.Considering the quality of your ore and the current price of a kilogram of nickel iron as quoted by Ganymede half an hour ago, multiplied by my rate of excavation, this salvage mission has thus far cost you exactly 1,360 BTUs.There!the old miner crowed triumphantly.See?You know how much one thousand BTUsll buy?Ten cubic centimeters of hydrogen, at current prices, the computer answered, or three ration bars.Damn inflation, the miner growled.Its getting so a body cant afford a patch for the arse of his coveralls anymore.Be that as it may, the computer mused, I believe a human life is worth considerably more.Not the life of a confounded telepath, damn it!Sam was trembling.She pushed Dars hand away and took a determined step into the cabin.Me first, Whitey growled as he squeezed past her.This ones more my sizeor age, anyway.He stepped into the cabin, calling out, There arent any telepaths on our ship, old timer.Looking back over his shoulder, Dar saw that Whitey was only telling the truthLona and Father Marco stood right behind him.And thanks for the rescue, by the way, Whitey finished.The old miner spun around, staring wild eyed.Where in helld you come from?No, we hadnt quite gotten there yet, Whitey said amiably.Might have, if you hadnt picked us up, though.The miner whirled back to his console, glaring.Who said you could let this trash in?The Distressed Spacers Law   Shove the law up the plasma bottle!the old miner howled.Youre supposed to be loyal to me, not to them!My initial programming included only one principle of higher priority than loyalty to my current owner, the computer admitted.There wasnt even supposed to be one!Whitey grinned.Dont tell me you believed everything the used brain salesman told you.What was the higher priority, anyway?The sanctity of human life, the computer answered, unless the human in question is attacking my current owner.Well, who could object to that?Whitey fixed the miner with a glittering stare.The old man glared back at him, started to say something, stopped, and turned away, muttering under his breath.No, I didnt think you would.Whitey smiled, amused.No decent person could.And we want to show you our thanks, of course.The old miner swept a quick, appraising glance over Whiteys worn, tattered clothing.Thanks dont mean much, unless it shows up as figgers in my credit readout.Whitey kept the smile, but his eyes glittered again.Well, of course.We wouldnt expect you to ship us to safety for free.Oh, sure!When we get to port, youll slip your card into my banks terminal, and itll read prettybut five days later, itll turn out that account in a Terran bank was closed out five years ago!Whitey didnt answer; he just slapped his jacket pocket.It clinked.The old miners gaze fastened onto it.Thirty kwahers for taking each of us to Ceres City, Whitey said easily.The old miners eye gleamed.Fifty!Well, we dont use up that much air and reaction massand itll have to be short rations, since you only provisioned for yourself.Call it thirty five.Thirty five kilowatt hours apiece?The old miner hawked and spat.You fergit, misterIll have to go on short rations, too!Forty fiveand thats gifting!Yes, it means Im gifting you with an extra ten kwahers for each of us.Ill go up to forty.Forty kwahers apiece?the miner bleated.One hundred twenty all told?Mister, you know how much Ill lose from not working my claim while I haul you?One hundred fifty kilowatt hours, 3087 BTUs, the computer answered, including reaction mass, air, and sustenance.There!See?I wont even break even!The miner lifted his chin.But Ive got five people, not three.Its two hundred kwahers total.Five ?The miners gaze darted toward the companionway; Lona and Father Marco stepped into sight.Youll make a profit, Whitey pointed out.The hell I will!The miner reddened.Thats two more for air, reaction mass, and rations!Cost included, the computer informed him.I counted the number of times the airlock door opened and closed.The miner rounded on it, bawling, Whose side are you on, anyway?My apologies.I cannot resist accuracy in mathematics.Try a little, the miner growled, and turned back to Whitey.Forty nine kwahers aint much of a profit, mister.Why dont you just ask me for the whole blasted boat?Whitey shrugged.What do you want for it?The miner stared.Then he said, flatly, One thousand therms.The computer said, Current list price   Shut up!the miner roared.He turned back to Whitey with a truculent glare.Well?Oh, now, let me see  Whitey stepped up to the console and turned the clinking pocket inside out.Coins cascaded onto the bench.He picked them up, stacking them on the console and counting slowly.Twenty  eighty  two hundred   The miners eyes followed each coin, whites showing all around the irises.Eight hundred fifty six  eight hundred fifty seven  five kwahers  ten kwahers   The miners mouth worked.Eight hundred fifty seven therms, twenty three kwahers, 2,392 BTUs.Whitey looked up at the miner.Take it or leave it.Done!The old man pounced on the stack, scooping them into his coverall pockets.You bought yourself a burro boat, mister!And its computer.Whitey looked up at the grid above the console.You work for me now.You were cheated, the computer informed him.The old miner cackled.I know, Whitey said equably.A beat up old tub like this couldnt be worth more than five hundred therms.The old miner glanced up at him keenly.Then whyd you buy it?I felt sorry for the computer.Whitey turned back to the grid.You take orders from me, nowor from my niece, really; shes the pilot.Hi, she said, stepping up beside Whitey.Im Lona.Dar stared, galvanized by the warmth in her voice.What a waste!All that allure cast before a machinewhen it couldve been coming at him!Lona sat down at the console.Lets get acquainted, FCC 651919.By the way, do you mind if I call youuhFess?Fess?Dar frowned.Why that?Lona looked back at him over her shoulder How would you pronounce FCC?Never mind, thiss how Im going to pronounce it!She turned back to the grid.If you dont mind, of course.My opinion is of no consequence, the computer answered.My owner has delegated the necessary authority to you, so you may call me what you will.Not if you dont like it.A good computer tech needs a certain degree of rapport with her machine.Such rapport can only exist within your own consciousness, the computer replied.I am incapable of feelings.All right, then, humor me; I need the illusion.Besides, since a computers mathematical, it has to be electronically biased toward harmony and euphony.So I ask you again: does the name Fess suit you?The computer hesitated.When it did speak, Dar couldve sworn there was a note of respect in its tones.The designation is pleasing, yes.Fine.Lona settled down to work, eyes glowing.Now, Fesshow long ago were you first activated?Five years, seven months, three days, six hours, twenty one minutes, and thirty nine secondsTerran Standard, of course.I assume you do not require a more precise response.No, thatll do nicely.Lonas eyes gleamed.And computers tend to be very durable these days; youre almost brand new.With you in it, this burro boat shouldve been worth twice what Grandpa paid for it.The old miner cackled again.Whats wrong with you?Lona demanded.The computer was silent for a minute; then it answered, My first owner inherited vast wealth, and spent a great deal on material pleasures  A playboy.Dar could almost see Lonas mouth water.I can see why hed need a very loyal brain for his personal robot.Indeed.Due to his, ah, excesses, it was frequently necessary for me to assume piloting of his aeroyacht.Meaning he did the best he could to become a cask, and you had to fly him home when he was dead drunk.You choose accurate terms, the computer admitted.On our last journey, however, he retained consciousness, though his judgment and reflexes were severely impaired.Consequently, I could not, according to my program, assume control until it became totally obvious that his life was imperiled.Meaning he was heading right for a collision, but you couldnt take over until it was almost too late.What happened?By swerving the ship, I did manage to avoid damage to the cabin.Unfortunately, I was located in the aft bulkhead, which did suffer some impact.Lona nodded.What was broken inside you?Nothing.But one capacitor was severely weakened.Now, in moments of stress, it discharges in one massive surge.Lona frowned.It could burn you out.Couldnt they fix it?Not without a complete overhaul and reprogramming, which would have been more expensive than a new unit.They did, however, install a circuit breaker and a bypass, so that the capacitor now discharges in isolation.Unfortunately, I am thereby deactivated until the breaker is reset.If you were human, theyd call it a seizure.Whatd your owner do?He elected to sell me, which was economically wise.But lacked ethical harmony.Aptly put.However, there were no buyers on Terra, nor in the Martian colonies.No one wished to purchase an epileptic robot brain.But in the asteroid belt, Lona murmured, theyll buy anything.If the price is low enough, yes.Mine was seventeen therms.Of low price, but incalculable value.Lona smiled grimly.After all, youve just saved all five of our lives.True, but it was a low stress situation for me.In a moment of true crisis, I would fail, and cause your deaths.Lona shook her head.When things get that tense, I do my own piloting.The computer just feeds me the choices.No, I think youll turn out to be the best thing that ever happened to me, Fess.Which was something of a blow to Dars ego; so maybe it was just his imagination that made the computer sound worshipful as it said, I will do all that I can to serve you.Lona just smiled.Apropos of which, the computer went on, it might interest you to know that, while we have been talking, my former master was surreptitiously transmitting a message to Ceres City.Every eye locked onto the old miner.Thats garbage!he spluttered.Youve been sitting here next to me the whole time!I didnt say a word!Computers cant lie.Lonas gaze was a poniard.Its a breakdown!Malfunction!Programming error!Howd he do it, Fess?Lona never took her glare off the old miner.By pressing and releasing the transmission button, the computer answered.That sent out carrier wave pulses, which spelled out letters in the ancient Morse code.What did he say?Whiteys voice was almost dreamy.Solar Patrol, emergency!the computer recited,  Burroboat FCC 651919 has just picked up five castaways.Have reason to believe they were crew and passengers of ship you were just chasing.Emergency!Lona stood up with the slow, sinuous grace of a panther.Whitey stepped over beside her, his eyes chips of ice.How do you want to be spacedwith or without your pressure suit?Butbut you cant do that!The old miner cowered back against the bulkhead.I picked you up!I saved your lives!Your computer did, Lona corrected, and its ours now.The killing of humans, Fess murmured, is the worst of crimes.Whats your definition of human?Whitey growled, glaring at the miner.Treachery is right up there, too, Lona pointed out.True, Father Marco agreed, but this man had no reason for loyalty to our little bandand every reason for loyalty to the government, and its Solar Patrol.If you can call blind faith reason,  Whitey grunted.But I guess you would, Father.Sir!Father Marco stiffened.Ill remind you that Im an engineer as well as a priest!But I am able to look at the situation from his viewpoint.A gleam came into Whiteys eyes.Well, thenwhy not let him see things from our viewpoint?The one we had an hour ago.You wouldnt!The miner blanched.Oh, dont worry.Whiteys lip curled.Theyll pick you up way before your supplies run out.Whats he got on his claim, Fess?A bubble cabin ten feet down inside the asteroid, the computer replied, with complete life support systems and a months rations.With a two way radio?No; he had mine, and didnt see the need for the expense.I do, however, have a spare emergency beacon.Perfect!Whitey grinned.He can call for help, but he cant rat on us.Oh, dont give me that terrified look, you old crawler!The patrolll have you safe in Ceres City inside of a week!Will that give us enough of a start?Lona growled.Whiteys lips pressed into a thin line.Itll have to.Come back here, consarn you!The voice echoed tinnily from the consoles grid.Come back here with my burro boat, you blasted pirates!Ill have the law on you!Damn!Whitey snapped his fingers into a fist.I shouldve made him sign a bill of sale!Now hell have the Patrol hunting us down for piracy, on top of everything else.Dar shrugged.What does it matter?Theyll chase us anyway, as soon as they pick him up and he tells them his story.I know, I know.But thisll give em a legal pretext for holding us.I think not, Fess demurred.Since the transaction was a verbal contract, I recorded it as standard operating procedure.Whiteys scowl dissolved into a grin.Old Iron, I think you may have your uses.A lot of them; he wasnt really designed to pilot a boat, or even just to compute, said Lona.He was designed as the brain of a humanoid robot.True, but my motor functions are adaptable to almost any sort of mechanical body, Fess explained.Im really quite generalized.And, therefore, versatile, Whitey concluded.Well, what we need you to do most, just now, is to get us to Luna undetected.Why Luna?Dar frowned.We want to get to Terra.They dont allow spacers to land there, Sam explained.Populations too dense; too much chance of a minor accident killing thousands of people.Spacers have to land on the moon, and take a shuttle down to Earth.Besides, were running a little high on notoriety at the moment, Whitey added.We need some sort of cover to let us traveland I have a few friends on Luna.Dar shrugged.Why not?You have friends everywhere.Since you wish to avoid attention, Fess suggested, it might be best if we wait for a large vessel to pass near, and match orbits, staying as close to it as possible, so that were inside its sensor range, and blend into its silhouette on any Patrol ships screens.Dar frowned.Isnt that a little chancy?Not for the two of us.Lona patted the console.Dar felt a hot stab of jealousy.What do you think that circuit stack isthe boy next door?Lona gave him a look veiled by long lashes above a cat smile.Why not?She turned to the console grid.Whered you grow up, electron pusher?I was manufactured on Maxima.Not exactly my home territory.Lonas eyes gleamed.But Ive heard of it.All they do there is make computers and robots, right?That is their sole industry, yes.Their sole occupation of any sort, in fact.Sloggers, the girl translated.A bunch of technological monks.They dont care anything about creature comforts; all they want to do is build robots.Not quite true, Fess corrected.The few humans on Maxima have every conceivable luxury knownincluding a few unknown anywhere else, which they invented themselves.In fact, they live like kings.Oh, really!Lona smiled, amused.Whenre they planning to join the aristocracy?Some have already begun buying patents of nobility from the Terran College of Heralds.Lona lost her smile.That takes real money!Where do they get it from?From the sale of computers and robots.The computer added modestly, Their products are already acknowledged to be the finest in any of the human occupied worlds.So they sell for a small fortune each, of course.But the biggest luxury of all is servantswhich they cant have, if therere only a few humans.True, Fess admitted, but there are three robots to every human, on the average.They do not lack for servitors.Sounds like a great life, Whitey sighed, if you dont mind settling down.And dont mind being stuck out in the middle of nowhere, Sam added.The planetoid is rather bleak, Fess admitted.Planetoid?Lona frowned.I thought Maxima was a world.It would be counted a small moon if it orbited a planet, Fess demurred.But since it is located in Sinuss asteroid belt, it can only be counted as one of the larger of those asteroids.Whitey frowned.No atmosphere.No trees or grass, mused Sam.Only rocks and dust, murmured Dar.Only eight point seven light years from Terra!caroled Lona.Dar stared.You like the sound of the place?Its practically heaven!Lona squealed.Nothing to do but design and build computers, laze around luxury, and hop around the corner to the fleshpots of Terra for the weekend!Where do I sign up?Immigration is completely open, Fess said slowly, but very few people choose to go there.It would be miserable for anyone who was poorand only excellent cyberneticists can make money.Ill take it!Lona crowed.How do I get there?That, Fess agreed, is the rub.They will accept youif you can get there.Grandpa!Lona whirled around to Whitey.Got a few royalty checks coming in?Whitey shrugged.You can have the burro boat when were done with it, sweetheartbut first theres a little matter of saving democracy.Well, lets get it over with!Lona whirled back to the console.I want to get on with the really important things!Found a big liner yet, electro eyes?I have been tracking the SASE San Martin while we have been conversing, Fess answered.It approaches above the plane of the ecliptic, inbound from Ganymede, and will pass us only one hundred thirty seven kilometers away.Then lets go!Lona grabbed her webbing and stretched it across her.Web in, everybody!A chorus of clicks answered her.She grinned down at her console, then frowned at a blinking red light and looked back over her shoulder at Father Marco.Look, Father, I know you trust in St.Christopher, and all thatbut would you please buckle in?The monolith of a liner hurtled into eternal morning, its aft hull lost in the total black shadow of its bulging bridge.A tiny speck danced up to it from the asteroid belt, glinting in the sunlight.It swooped up to disappear in shadow under the monsters belly, where it clung like a pilot fish to a shark by the bulldog magnetic fields of the solenoids in its nose.Inside, Dar asked, Couldnt they spot us by the magnetic fields on their hull?They could.Lona shrugged.But why would they look for them?She switched off the engines.It doesnt quite seem ethical, Father Marco mused, hitching a free ride this way.Dont let it worry you, Father, Whitey assured him.I own stock in this shipline.10  The SASE San Martin drifted down toward its berth in the Mare Serenitatis.As it passed over Darkside, a mite dropped off its belly, falling toward the surface at no higher acceleration than lunar gravity could account for.No glint of light reflected from it to any watching eye in the shadows; and if anyone thought to glance at it on a sensor screen, they would surely think it nothing but another meteorite caught by the moons gravity, coming to add one more crater to the ancient, pockmarked satellite.It fell almost to the surface, so low that it was beneath the sensor nets, and barreled over the jagged landscape.Inside the cabin, Lona asked.Is this what youd call a stress situation?Not at all, Fess assured her.It is simply a matter of adjusting our trajectory with the attitude jets, according to the irregularities in the landscape indicated by the sensors.At this low a speed, I always have several milliseconds to react.Piece of cake, huh?I think youd better keep the con for this one.As mademoiselle wishes, Fess murmured.He finally brought them to rest when the glittering lights of a spaceport appeared over the horizon.The burro boat sank to the dust in the shadow of a huge crag, with the weary, thankful groan of engines idling down.I detected an airlock hatch in this outcrop, Fess informed them.There is an electronics kit in the cabinet below the console; can any of you bypass the telltale on the hatchway, so that Spaceport Security will not know the lock has been opened?Duck soup, Lona affirmed, the instant kind.Wherell you be while were gone?In the shadow of a ring wall, in a remote crater, Fess answered.I will move as the shadows move.Next to the electronics kit, you will find a small transmitter of convenient size for a pocket.Press the button on it, and it will send a coded pulse to me.When I receive it, I will determine your location from its vector and amplitude, and bring the boat to you.Lona opened the cabinet, pulled out the electronics kit, and flipped the recall unit to Whitey.He caught it and slipped it into a pocket inside his belt.Whats its range?A thousand kilometers, Fess answered.If you call from Serenitatis Spaceport, I will hear you.How about if we have to call you from Terra?You will have to feed the signal through a stronger transmitter.We cant ask for a complete guarantee.Father Marco rose and turned toward the companion way.I think I can remember where I left my pressure suit.There are ten air bottles in the locker with them, Fess noted.Well, thanks for all the help.Lona shooed the rest of the crew aft.If anyone knocks while were gone  I will not let them in, Fess assured her.The airlock hatch had a panel with a button inset beside it.Lona pulled out a screwdriver, tightened in the appropriate blade, and set it into the screw.It whined twice, and she lifted the panel away, handing it to Dar.Dar watched her clip a couple of leads in.Above them, a twelve foot parabolic dish moaned as it rotated a few degrees, and stopped.Lona leaped back as though shed been stabbed.Dar didnt blame her; it was all he could do to keep from dropping the plate.He wished he had; then he couldnt have heard the antennas moan, since the sound conducted into his suit through the wires holding the plate.Whitey leaned over, touching his helmet against Lonas.After a minute, she nodded, then stepped grimly back to the airlock.She took the plate from Dar and replaced it.Then she pressed the button, and the hatch slowly swung open.She gestured to Dar, and he stepped in.The others followed, Lona last.Whitey pressed a plate in the wall, and the hatch swung shut.Dar waited, fidgeting.Finally, the inner hatch opened.He stepped through into darkness, cracked his helmet seal, and tilted it back.He turned as a glow light lit in Whiteys hand, saw Lona tilting her helmet back as Father Marco closed the airlock.Whatre we gonna do about the bypass?Dar asked.Leave it there.Lona shrugged.Cant be helped.Security patrols all the locks regularly, supplied Sam the bureaucrat.Theyll find it within a few days.Not exactly what Id call a cheery thought, but it lightens the conscience.Whatd you do to make that microwave dish swing around, Lona?Nothing, Whitey answered.That dish was beaming commercial 3DT programming down to the Terran satellites.When it gets done feeding its schedule to one satellite, it rotates to lock onto another one, and starts the whole feed all over again.3DT?Dar frowned.Why do they feed it from the moon?Because thats where they make the programs, innocent!Sam snorted.Whitey nodded.It takes a lot of room for enough 3DT sound stages to make new programming for a hundred twenty channels each, for twenty six main culturesand they have to make new stuff constantly.There just wasnt enough room for it in the major cities.So, bit by bit, the production companies shifted up here to Luna, where real estate was very cheap.The whole entertainment industry for the entire I. D. E.  is in the moon now.Some say it belonged there all along, anyway, Lona muttered.Oh.Dar mulled it over.So your publishers offices are up here, too?No, the print industry stayed Earthbound.Oh.Dar looked around at the rough hewn tunnel walls scored with the screw tracks of a laser borer.Well, not much we can do here, is there?I suppose our next step is to hop a shuttle to Terra.Wrong.Whitey shook his head.That asteroid miner has probably sung the Solar Patrol a whole opera by now.Every security guard on the moon will have memorized little sketches of us.Weve got to establish some kind of cover identities first, not to mention something by way of disguises.Dar felt his stomach sink.I shouldve known it couldnt be something straightforward and simple.Not on Terra, Sam agreed, and the moons just as bad.She turned to Whitey.What kind of cover did you have in mind?I didnt.Whitey started climbing out of his gear.I recommend we rack these suits and find some place to hole up while we think about it.Whitey had indeed emptied out his purse for the old minerbut he had another one hidden inside his belt.A brief stop at a department store turned up a coiffeured wig and translucent dress for Sam, some hair dye and baggy tunic and trousers for Lona, some more hair dye and business outfits for the men.A somewhat longer stop at a comfort station produced remarkable changes in their appearance.Whitey lined them up in the hallway, looked them over, and nodded.Youll do.Just barely, maybe, but youll do.Now, the odds are that your prints are on file somewhereoh, youre sure of it, Dar?Well, the rest of you dont take chances, either.Dont put your thumbprint to anything.Dont look into anything that might want to scan your retinas, eitherno peekholes in amusement galleries, eyepiece 3DT viewers, or lens fitting scopes.Understand?Good.Because youre in the Big Sapphires computer net now, folks, and every step you take is liable to monitoring by a computer tied into Terra Central.Is it really that bad?Dar asked.Worse, Sam confirmed.Whitey nodded again.Have no illusions, folks.Our chances of getting away free, back to the colony planets, are slightly worse than a dinosaurs caught in a glacier.I can only hope the gambles worth the share time.Okayfrom now on, were a free lance production crew, looking for work.Anything I say about you, just confirm it, and dont look surprised.That includes your names; Ill be thinking up new ones for you as we go along.Ready?March!The march took them to a twenty foot high faade sheared out of the lunar rock, decorated with the modest gleam that comes of vast wealth, and the words Occidental Productions, Inc.carved over the doorway and sheathed in platinum.Thiss just the production house, Whitey explained.Manufactures most of the entertainment for one of the anglophone channels.As they passed through the door, Dar found himself somehow totally certain that each persons height, weight, build, and coloring was registering in a computer somewhere deep inside the complex, which was trying to correlate it with the descriptions of all known criminals who might have a grudge against OCI.It was almost enough to make him turn right around and try to hijack the next outgoing spacer.That didnt quite do it, but the foyer nearly did.Oh, the carpet was thick and the decoration superb; that wasnt the problem.It was the three uniformed guards, two androids, and five cameras, every one of which seemed to be looking directly at him.He stopped in his tracks, swallowing something that he hoped wasnt his heart.But Whitey strolled ahead, confident and nonchalant, looking totally like your ordinary, everyday plutocrat.Service, citizen?the lead guard asked with perfect, impersonal politeness.Gratitude, citizen.Mr.Tambourin, to see Mr.Stroganoff.Do you have an appoi  the guard began, out of habit.But he closed his mouth, and gazed up at Whitey for a moment.Then he said, Of course, Mr.Tambourin.He turned to murmur into a shielded com unit, waited, then murmured again.A delighted yelp sounded faintly from the unit.The guard listened, nodded, and turned back to Whitey.He will be up in a few minutes, Mr.Tambourin.I regret the delay, but   Of course.Whitey smiled indulgently.He didnt know I was comingbut then, neither did I.  Old friends, you understand.Perfectly.The guard was a good liar, anyway.If youll step into the lobby, Mr.Tambourin ?Whitey smiled with a gracious, affable nod, and turned back to the team.Come along, children.He turned and ambled away toward the big interior doors.Dar could fairly hear Sam bristling as they followed.The androids swung the doors open, inclining in a slight bow as Whitey passed through.As Dar filed by, he definitely did not receive the expected impression of being scanned.What with one thing and another, it boosted his opinion of Whiteys status till it almost soared.They entered a world of sybaritic luxuryparqueted walls with huge, inscrutable paintings that fairly screamed, ART!surrounding chairs that seemed to mold themselves around the sitters body, a carpet so thick that it must have had a heartbeat, and a tastefully almost dressed hostess who bent low to murmur, Refreshment, citizen?A month ago, Dar would have grabbed her and enacted the wildest scene of animal lust ever recorded (which it no doubt would have been).But, with Lona in the same room, the woman just didnt seem interesting.Yes, something to drink, thanks.Nothing too stimulating.When she handed him the drink, he took a tiny sipand euphoria/ecstasy/exaltation/Nirvana rose up behind his eyeballs and exploded in streamers that enveloped his brain.He sat rigid for a moment, then coughed delicately into his fist, and set the drink down.Hed had occasional experiences with the pipeweed of Wolmar, during prairie grass fires, and knew a depressant when one hit him.The lady had taken him at his word, and then some; he wondered if hed unwittingly spoken a code phrase.Then a medium sized man with a giant of a personality swept into the lounge.Tambourin!You infernal old scoundrel!Welcome back!Whitey stood up just in time to be almost knocked down by the dynamos enthusiasm.All that kept him up was the bear hug as Stroganoffs rolling laughter boomed in their ears.Then Stroganoff held Whitey back at arms length, grinning from ear to ear.Let me look at you, ancient my wastrel!Not a day!Ten years, and he hasnt aged a wrinkle!Well, I was old enough the last time I saw you.Whitey slapped Stroganoff on the shoulder.Solid meat still, eh?Youre not doing so badly yourself, David!Not since they gave me that new stomach, no.But let me put on my manners a second.Glad to meet you, folks, Im David Stroganoff.Whore your friends, Whitey?Oh, this is Fulva Vulpes.Whitey stretched a hand out to Lona, whose eyes registered only the faintest of surprises.Shes my assistant director and director of editing.Stroganoffs eyebrows went up.Unusual combination.He pressed Lonas hand.You must be very good with computers.Now Lona did show surprise.She glanced at Whitey.Stroganoff chuckled.And whos this enchantress?Sam answered the compliment with a glare, which brought even more charm feeding back from Stroganoff.Watching to make sure the compliments not more than its subject is worth, eh?Believe me, its sound as an erg.What is she, Todyour unit manager?If it comes in a bureaucratic package and is wrapped with red tape, I can cut it, Sam said warily.Unit manager, it is!And you, citizen?Cobum Helith, research and script development.Cos the one who came up with the idea for tying my verses into a story, Dave.Wh  Todn Ive been talking for some time now.Father Marco shook Stroganoffs hand without batting an eyelid.I work from fundamental mythic structureswhich means I have trouble thinking commercially, of course.Well, dont let it worry youthe myth hasnt been born that cant be debased, Stroganoff said with a perfectly straight face.He turned to Dar.And the young one, Tod?Perry TeticPa to us juveniles.Hes the debaser you just mentioned.Whitey was obviously making it up as he went along.The commercializer.Hes very good at putting the most abstract ideas into words even the average dunce can understand.Oh, really.Stroganoff shook Dars hand with guarded interest.Lets hope we have time for a chat, Perry.Im kind of interested in that kind of thing, myself.Lets make time.Dar was sure of being able to hold up his end of that conversation; anyone whod been through Chollys curriculum could.At least Whitey had given him a role he knew something aboutand, looking back on it, he realized Whiteyd done the same for each of the others, too.a little behind the state of the art, he realized Lona was saying.Could I have a look at your editing facilities?Of course, of course!Tour of the whole place, in fact.Sound Stage Number Tens the first stopI just ducked out of there, and Ive got to quack back to make sure everythings running smoothly.Come on, this way!He set off, Whitey beside him; the rest followed in their wake.They turned into a corridor that opened off the lounge, Whitey and Stroganoff talking double speed.So you put together your own production unit, eh, Tod?Glad to see you were listening when I kept saying you ought to package up a tank playbut I didnt expect you to raft your own team!Only way Ill touch it, Dave.Whitey shook his head, jaw set.With me in control over the whole thing.You may notice were lacking a producer, though.Yeah, I did kind of notice that.Stroganoff grinned like a shark.Is that an offer, Tod?What do you wantthumbscrews?Always the consummate diplomat.You know I cant resist a chance on something this goodbut you need backing, too.You cant be crazy enough to try to finance something like this on your own.Well, I dont exactly have a reputation for thrift.Whitey grinned.But Im not that far gone.No thrift, my Aunt Asteroid, Lona muttered.Hes got enough in the Bank of Terra to buy a small planetdeveloped!It was a good chance to get close to her Dar sidled up and whispered, Theyre buddies.How come Stroganoff keeps calling him Tod?Cause he doesnt know about Whitey,  Lona muttered back.Nobody does, outside the taverns.Well.That also explained the security problem that had been giving Dar heartburn.Hed thought Whitey was bringing sure disaster down on them by using his real namebut anyone on Falstaff whod told Canis Destinus that Whitey the Wino was helping Dar Mandra wouldnt have known him as Tod Tambourin.So his best alias was his real name.Right in here.Stroganoff hauled open a door that looked like a huge airlock hatch.Stage Ten.As Sam filed past him, he added,  Fraid I didnt catch your name, citizen.Shes Ori Snipe, Whitey called back over his shoulder, and Sam forced a quick smile and handshake as she left Stroganoff in her wake.They walked into chaos.Dars first whirling impression was of a thousand people frantically everywhere, doing purposeless things and shouting at each other in an arcane jargon.But after a few minutes, he began to be able to make sense out of it.There werent really a thousand peoplemore like three dozen.And they werent really moving very quicklyit was just that there were so many of them moving in so many different directions that it seemed frantic.He locked his gaze onto one woman and watched her for a while.She was riding around on a lift, a slender telescoping column on top of a three wheeled dolly, adjusting the lights that hung far above him.Her movements were methodical, almost ploddingnothing chaotic about them at all.He dropped his gaze to watch another person, then another.It may look confusing, Stroganoff said beside him, but everyone knows what he or she has to do, and does it.Dar glanced up at him, saw a frown.Something wrong?Stroganoff shook his head.No, its all going smoothly.A little ahead of schedule, in fact.Then whats the matter?Oh, nothing, really.Stroganoff forced a smile.Its just that sometimes the phoniness of it gets to me.Dar frowned.But youre making stories, hereand stories have to be made up; they cant be real.Oh yes, they can.Stroganoff pursed his lips.Therere a lot of really great stories in the history books.The statement had a ring of familiarity to Dar; suddenly, he could almost believe he was back in Chollys Tavern.He cleared his throat to get rid of a sudden tightness.That almost sounds like education.Sh!Stroganoff hissed, finger to his lips.He glanced around furtively, then breathed a sigh of relief.Thank heaven!No one heard you!Why?Dar stared.Whats wrong with education?Be quiet, cant you?Stroganoff glanced around again.Dont you dare say that word in here!Why?Whats the matter with ed  uh  hum  you know!Whats the matter with it is that it pulls low ratings, Stroganoff explained in a lowered voice.That kind of program never attracts more than a handful of viewers.Yeah, but thats a handful of all the people in Terran space!A handful out of a trillion and a half!So that handful is a billion or so people; yes, I know.Stroganoff nodded.But that never sinks in, to the people who run this company.All they know is that they can get a higher price for a more popular show.So.Dar frowned.You dont dare put in anything ed  uh  at all deep, or theyll cancel the script.Stroganoff nodded.Thats the basic idea, yah.And you dont like it that way?Stroganoff hesitated; then he shook his head.So you dont like your job?Oh, I like it well enough.Stroganoff looked around him.There is still a fragrance left, out of the old glamor I thought was here when I was a kid.And it is exciting, putting together a story, even if its purely trivial dross.Its just that  well, sometimes it gets to me.But why?Because I wanted to educate.Stroganoff turned back to Dar with a gentle, weary smile.Not just a few interested students in a classroombut the whole, huge mass of the audience, the billions of people who arent interested, who dont want to learn all those irrelevant facts about Socrates and Descartes, and Simon de Montfort and the Magna Carta.I kinda thought knowing about the Magna Carta was necessary for all the citizens in a democracy, Dar said uneasily.At least, if that democracy is going to survive   If, Stroganoff said, with a sour smile.Look around you.Dar swallowed.I think youve got a point.Oh, I know I do.Stroganoff looked up at the lights on their grid of pipes, gazing at them but not seeing them.And I knew 3DT was the perfect thing to teach withgive the people lectures, but make them so visually interesting that theyd watch it in spite of themselves.Dont just tell them about Waterlooshow it to them, the actual place, the way it is today, and the way it was then.Then show them the battle, reenact it, cut to an overhead shot so they can see how Wellington and Napoleon were moving their troops  He trailed off, a faraway look in his eyes.Wait a minute!Dar stabbed a finger at the producer I saw that battle!In an old 3DT program!The charge, and the horses galloping into the sunken roadthen you saw from overhead, watched Napoleons army folding in, but while you were watching it, you heard Wellington describing his strategy   Sure you didnt read that in a book somewhere?Yeah, but it didnt make any sense until after I saw the program!Josephines Boudoir, that was it!Yeah, it sure was.Stroganoffs mouth worked as though hed tasted something bitter.Im surprised youre old enough to have seen it.I was way out on a, um, frontier planet.I remember it was mostly a pretty risqu version of Napoleons private lifebut it did have the battle of Waterloo in it.Yes.It did have that.Stroganoff smiled out at the studio.Not much education in itbut some.Itll do.Why didnt you go into educational programming?Dar asked softly.Stroganoff shrugged, irritated.I did, fresh out of college.But they insisted that everything be dull and dry.Claimed the students wouldnt take it seriously if it was too entertainingand they had research studies to back them up.Strange as it may seem, most people dont believe its education if it isnt dulland that means it reaches a very few people, indeed.Most of whom would learn by themselves, anyway?Stroganoff nodded.The minority who read.Yes.Theyre wonderful people, but theyre not the ones I was worried about, not the ones who endangered democracy.Dar nodded.Its the ones who dont want to learn that you want to reach.Right.Stroganoff closed his eyes, nodding.Not that its going to do any good, of course.Oh, if Id started a hundred years ago, maybe   It cant be that bad!Dar frowned.I thought a democracy had to become decadent before it collapsed.So?But were not!Dar spread his hands, hooked into claws.Wherere the orgies?Wheres the preoccupation with sex?Wherere the decadent aristocrats?At the I. D. E.  enclave in New York.Stroganoff gave him a wry smile.Ever seen em?Funny about that   Well, okay.But the orgies   Been looking for them pretty hard, havent you?Well, dont worrythey dont need to be there.How many orgies do you think the average Roman shopkeeper saw?Look for the decadence in the small thingsthe people who dont bother to vote because the candidatesre so much alike.The people who think its fine for the government to crack down, as long as it doesnt interfere with their getting their supply of their favorite euphoric.The people who think talking politics is in poor taste.Theres the decadence that kills a democracy.
