In the throne room of his mind, the little emperor needed to pardon Straka for his interruption, it was the only rational way Xavier could continue on without lashing out and berating him in front of the others.The slight smirk that came across Xaviers face was the only clue any such exoneration had ever happened.Look!You see, here is an individual who hasnt even been on Mars for more than a few hours and already he is proactive in trying to resolve our situation.In response to your question about having a preprogrammed target, we have teams going over his records since his activation, and although we are far from finished with this task, the data transfer appears to be clean, with no apparent mission cataloged within his system.Given all the circumstances we have been confronted with to this point in time, we have to consider ourselves quite fortunate a target was never assigned.Well, from the way you have been crooning on about this Dextoid, I would have to say so.Xavier was beside himself, this type of disrespect could not keep going unchallenged.He paused and looked at Straka in an overtly curious manner, chiding him with a rather belittling voice.We have made the right choice in bringing you all the way up here, havent we?You wont be leaving us with feelings of regret?It would be a very poor lapse in judgment to assume I am some aimless entity blowing across the deserts of your world to have accidentally wound up here.I am not a tumbleweed entangled in some barbed wire fence waiting for the likes of you to set me free.I have gotten this far in my life out of a refinement of purpose.Straka reached into his jacket and pulled out a billfold, allowing it to fall open to reveal the metallic star of a law enforcement official.He placed it on the table for all to see.People rely on the law and want to know its working for them day and night.They have these expectations because they lean hard on the pillars of justice, mooring their hopes and dreams to the base of its principles.Straka leaned forward and pointed toward his badge.Those legal pillars can only function if they are enforced.Now the law is the law, and what the law represents is a type of reciprocity.People are not going to lose their life disputing things like boundaries or those crass individuals who dont honor their contracts, but in the end they do expect payment for such injustices.When a decision is rendered and not enforced, a person becomes disenchanted.They want resolution and that is when they usually call me.You yourselves have come to this conclusion in dealing with your problems here on Mars.Straka picked up his badge, returning it to his jacket.Now before I left for this place, I requested a few things to help me with my job, and one of those things was to be sworn in as a Marshall.For those that dont know, that represents something higher than corporate policy, I have the legal right to ask the questions I need to ask, and do the things I need to do because I represent the law.Now from where I sit it seems this company comes up with a lot of questions after the fact.Pure and simple, that is regret.The quality exists up here as if it were part of the air you generate for this place.I can hear it in the voices of your employees, it is the undertone of this meeting, and it is the mission you have brought me here to resolve.Regret exists so thick within this company it should be stamped at the top of your letterhead.You want to know if you have made the right choice in bringing me up here?Well, I have questions too.Should I raise concern about how you under estimated something this dangerous, or how this Dextoid got up and walked right out the front door?Those questions would only reinforce the ugly energy of your regret.What has really perked my curiosity is what purpose this Dextoid serves?The silence following Strakas comments began to fill with a tension usually reserved for cataclysmic events.Everyone seemed to be on edge, waiting for Xavier to go into one of his usual tirades complete with vocal explosions of vile remarks.Leopold was an engineer who had been with this corporation since its inception.He was an older gentleman who had helped the company go through its trials and tribulations long before the arrival of their infamous leader.Since and on more then one occasion he had witnessed Xaviers tirades first hand.They were horrible and grating, and caused a great amount of disharmony amongst the employees.Leopold learned two things while being here on Mars; to avoid any verbal exchange with Xavier, and to diffuse any situation where Xavier looked to be broaching one of his famous tantrums.Now was such a time and Leopold leaned forward in his chair, deliberately clearing his throat, he would have thrown the papers from his folders into the air if he thought it would cut through the tension.Since our initial mishap with Alec, we have been running simulations on his activation.We found a flaw within his fight or flight programming that appears to have been the catalyst.In evaluating his situation he was able to both claim a foreign defense and perceived hostile actions against him.This line of programming was in place as a safe guard to prevent him from falling into the wrong hands.I think it obvious to everyone in the room why we cannot have this type of technology freely walking into the labs of our competitors.From here the data becomes fuzzy, but it is my belief Alec thought the ability we possessed in shutting him down was all that was needed for prompting his flight response.I should add we feel this type of situation can be avoided in the future if we download the programming within this particular model of Dextoid in a series of stages.Turning it on as we did with a large data base at its disposal left little time for conflict resolution, and I guess it freaked out.Xavier had been eyeing Leopold in disapproving fashion; he hadnt invited him to speak until later this afternoon.Order needed to be restored to the meeting, but his eyes looked to pop from his head upon hearing this last bit of information.He responded as dry and as slowly as he could, punctuating his feelings on the subject by allowing his voice to rise in harshness.Freaked out?Straka was unmoved by this.He sat slightly back in his chair and responded in calm concert with his pose.Seems to be the attitude of the moment.A very nice story, it puts us current with how we have arrived here, but I still wonder what his purpose is?Something had to be imprinted upon him before activation.Xavier was fighting every urge within his being to berate those in the room for their insolent behavior.He had to check himself, and remain magnanimous.Perhaps by taking a step back he could learn a little more about his staff, even more about Straka.This could be useful to him later as he allowed his plan to hatch.He would extract his vengeance on this insolent group another day.He closed his eyes and pictured them having to gather in a circle, and forcing them to draw lots.Leopold could see Straka wasnt going to stop until he got a satisfactory explanation as to what was driving Alec.As simple as the topic may have sounded, there were no easy answers to the subjects they were going to tackle.It was like pointing at an individual droplet of water and asking for an explanation about the rain.He took a deep breath and when the weight of his response felt right he spoke.There is no rhyme for what I am about to say, it is a hodgepodge of facts.I am stating them so you can get a feel for what we were trying to accomplish with this particular model of Dextoid.EMERGENCE Upon being named Chief of Security, Philman had been trying to get up to speed on matters concerning his post.He knew he needed to be on top of things if he expected to remain at his new position.He didnt know Johnston personally, but he knew of his reputation.Johnston was a man who knew how to extract information from those unlucky enough to be interrogated by him.Johnston and Xavier made for a pretty pair.All the while they were in control of the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation, Philman did his best to stay clear of them.Being assigned to the Southern Sector had always been looked at as a demotion by most colonists sent there, but not in the eyes of Philman.When he finally heard what happened to Johnston, he had a sneaking suspicion Xavier might have been behind it.Now being this close to Johnstons former boss only confirmed his fears.Part of maintaining a grip on his new position meant he would need to find a cause these colonists could rally around and support.Being in the public eye could help him with ruling his own roost.His position afforded him opportunities he would have never normally had, giving him the ability to create and enforce policy.Hate was a powerful tool and he would opt to use this in tightening the regulations around the Dextoids.He would rally the people around his personal quest of roping these mechanized beings in.Deep down inside he hated the Dextoids.Philman knew what they were capable of and wanted to make sure they never got a chance in gaining the upper hand.He had seen the classified reports about programmers injecting their own personal touches into the emotional packets of a Dextoid.These were lines of code well outside the prohibitors that were already requested, they gave Dextoids little ticks, cravings, a favorite artist, or senseless phobias.It was seen by most in the programming world as a joke, but Philman knew better.Reliable sources within the company warned these types of practical jokes would only lead to bigger problems later on in production.If people could imprint desires on these mechanized beings, or have them believe in a cause, it wouldnt be out of the realm of possibilities for a programmer to leave a series of orders to be carried out at a later date.The reports about Suicide Dextoids all but confirmed those programming fears.His heart sank when he began to read the files they had on Alec.There were infinite layers of programming going on within his cubits, it would take Philman several lifetimes to figure it all out.He was completely overwhelmed by all this data and knew there was every potential for information to fall through the cracks.These were his fears with every Dextoid he encountered, they were sneaky, tricky, disingenuous things, and they needed to be stopped.Having a scientist in his midst who could speak of these things was a godsend, and Philman listened intently for any clues that might help with his cause in slowing these Dextoids down.Leopold rubbed his face in a way that would make people in the room think he had a nervous twitch.It was always difficult to know exactly where to start with a complicated subject, so he paused just long enough for the energy of it to propel him.The concept of emergence happens all around us in the form of structures.We need to take a step back and recognize there is a boundary between where the natural world ends and emergence begins.Nature can produce things like stars and planets, mountain ranges, volcanoes, oceans and streams; nature however cannot construct a cube.The manmade structures we see around us in our everyday lives can be classified under the science of emergence.The more complex the structure we observe, the higher degree of emergence technology needed to support it.When it came to Alec we had to delve deep into his lines of code to match his variegated design.Leopold found an excitement with the things he was about to say and wasnt trying to hide his passion for them.These topics might very well represent a compilation of his life's work, and to that end he was very proud of them.Alec's survival protocols are far superior to anything found in production, and that includes any military grade Dextoid.He was preprogrammed with multiple forms of hand to hand combat and has the potential to be a master at any one of them.He has a complete methodology for covert operations and is well versed in things like explosives, firearms, and weapon systems.He also comes complete with a catalog of Dextoid genealogy to include makes, models, and manufacturers.He can repair or modify a Dextoid out in the field.He has a complete breakdown for the inner workings of almost every foreign national government, to include the language spoken, political hierarchy, and their different forms of security responses.He has extensive data on the topography, geology, and the location of every major structure here on Mars.He can operate any number of vehicles, to include those in avionics.He has details for every satellite orbiting this planet.All of those things were downloaded and in place so we could begin to put him through his paces.Another engineer on Leopolds team excitedly chimed in as if he were trying to sum it up for everyone in laymans terms.To give him a test run!Well, it was more then just some kind of test run, I mean the damn thing ran right out the front door.Straka looked a little peeved, these werent the answers he was looking for.This thing you have created is knowledgeable, I get a real sense for that, but then I have to ask what Dextoid isnt?What I am looking for verges more toward habits, general assignments, or tasks it might perform on a periodic basis.Straka was becoming annoyed and he could not fight back the urge to talk down to those in that room.Look, back on Earth, Service Dextoids are much closer to acting like ideal robots, so if they freak out, there is a certain amount of predictability that follows.Mining, environmental clean up, or military assistance, each of these tasks have a purpose and there is a set of programs that compliment their efforts.This gives us a set of principles we can follow in recovery of these assets, that is right up to the point where a company like yours refuses to share the purpose of what they have created.If you want this thing found, you are going to have to share what purpose it supports.His plea was greeted by silence.Straka suspected this meant they either knew the answer and were too afraid to tell him, or they really were clueless to what Alec was about.He highly doubted the latter.It was out of frustration he found his next set of words.His purpose is connected directly to our recapturing him, you do understand this?The silence was finally broken by Xavier.He spoke to them as if he were some tired old religious figure who was granting permission to his pulpit, allowing them to participate in this somewhat kerygmatic sermon.He raised his hand as he spoke, and waved it as if he were slowly shooing someone away.Please, someone respond to him.The engineer, who had so eloquently put things into layman terms just a few moments ago, spoke now as if he had nothing to lose.The end goal of this project was the complete integration of a neutralizing agent into a human based society.Straka looked at them with the same disdain a conscientious objector would have after stumbling upon the depredated crimes of a despotic regime.Ah, there it is then.Now your blanket of secrecy makes all the sense in the world.He was staring into the faces of people who felt themselves righteous by what they had created.Alec had put them on some sort of technological plateau, and from that height they had found the moral right for putting him together.Whether or not they meant to launch him into the world didn't matter now, they were in the thick of it, and there wasn't a button or a program that would bring him back.Alec was meant to keep people guessing from the moment he got away.Straka was in the thick of it as well, this carnival of the canaille, only he was refusing the gruel the corporation poured into their bowls.The employees had been conditioned to lap their drink from those dingy containers.There weren't many creatures who could run in a pack and ignore their own malformations and mange.These people were so far gone they could not see what they had become, well trained animals who hungrily defended the scraps tossed to them by their master.Straka looked to the head of the table; Xavier was the one tossing those meager scraps.Long before he left Earth for this place he knew their problem was going to be messy one.A company like this was bound to have some pretty ugly skeletons in their closets.They werent flying him all the way out here to simply file reports.Now with all their silence, they were telegraphing to him he was their point man on this, he was the one who would take the fall if things went wrong.Suddenly his badge seemed to be made of a cheaper metal, flexing under the weight of their lies.Straka was anything but a patsy.Why wouldnt they just come right out and say they had created a Strike Dextoid.I am always quite amused by the engineers who try to describe lethal projects in benign terms.Half of these Dextoids are emotional wrecks to begin with, give it another month and we will probably find him in some cave contemplating his own existence, literally.The statement was brash, but Philman could afford to be.Leopold took offense.Dont be too sure of that, he wasnt designed to waddle in the mundane of domestic service like other Dextoids.Alec is running on a completely different operating platform.He is a finely tuned instrument, closer to a surgical knife than some blunt apparatus.There was conviction behind what Leopold was saying, it held a passion only someone close to a project could convey.This isnt some worker bee or drone we have spent countless years developing just so he can be dependent upon the colony.Alec is an independent entity, and he is learning as he goes.Its all apart of his assessment strategy.Say we were to equate this in terms of playing a game of chess, then each day that goes by he will be playing at a higher level.The longer this timeline gets stretched out, the more likely he will begin to formulate his own opinions.I fear his solution for checkmate.POLICY OF TRANSPARENCY Looking at Straka one got the feeling he was very capable of extracting the information he needed from a person, and they wouldnt be too far off the mark if they said a one word answer would never cut it in his world.He became very good at ascertaining when someone was struggling with telling him the truth.He sensed there were people struggling with that very concept right here in this room.The concepts for their secrets were shrouded in acronyms and terms like plausible deniability.The liars would eventually reveal themselves, and it was important he find out who those individuals were.This name Alec, does it actually stand for something?Leopold was obviously still working with the head of steam he had developed from Philmans remark.His name is derived from the combination of two operational systems; Autonomous Logistics and Emergence Computing.Finding a way to bring these two systems together to operate within one device has been a dream long time in coming.Straka wondered how many among them were just like Leopold, filled to the brim with endless streams of information in their respective fields.This put the question about his purpose into perspective.What if Alecs purpose was revealed upon his completion and subsequent activation, much in the same way cells rally to support a living entity.No one cell could do it on its own, but as a group they could repair tissue, fight disease, and deliver the necessary messages to the body helping it to sustain life.To see Alecs purpose in this light gave reason for this Byzantine management structure.How else could they keep the real intent of Alec from so many people and still get the job done?Back on Earth, before Straka had resigned himself to becoming a bounty hunter, he was out in the field running under the blanket of covert operations.Deep in those remote areas, they were able to transmit and receive messages in a very direct and secretive fashion.The human beings transmitting those orders were in windowless rooms, gathering intelligence from satellites, drones, and autonomous vehicles.They used this data to probe their adversaries for weaknesses, backdoor entryways, exit points, and faulty lines of defense.There were units of Special Forces personnel, Strike Dextoids, and Assassins stationed in remote areas all over that war torn planet.They were poised, waiting patiently for their compact communiqu to descend from the heavens.Upon receiving those messages, clandestine entities went out and destroyed foreign communications towers, blew up manufacturing sites, and took out the terrorists as they trained in their camps.Straka had first hand knowledge of those things.He had waited more than once in his jungle lair for those encrypted message to fall from the skies.His was a war on drugs.He had crawled into the rat holes and bunkers of their hideaways to gather information or destroy their infrastructure.He knew the toxic smells that came from those underground dwellings.Those foul odors came to represent a surreptitious life filled with nothing but violence.He looked down at his left hand to see the scarring from the burns he received from one of those explosive encounters.Things just like this reminded him of where he had come from.His body had been riddled by the collateral damage of those missions.They taught him a lot about how the world really worked, and also went a long way in changing him.Projects like Alec didnt get completed under a policy of transparency.Lies and deception were just as much apart of this world as algae and plankton were apart of the ocean.From all appearances he was sitting smack dab in an ocean of people who knew their part.These staff members could drone on all day about how great their creation was, it wasnt going to bring him back into their fold.They had been cooking something up in the basement of this place for quite some time to have the likes of Alec crawl up to the surface.Looking down at his left hand, he wondered how many of them would be scarred by their project before this was all over.He would play their little game for now, all the while looking for those he could trust.If you had one thing you could say that sets Alec apart from other Dextoids, what would that be?Another of the engineers spoke up.He had a very tight and wiry head of hair, to the point of looking like a steel wool pad.Straka could not help but wonder if his hair was somehow genetically enhanced to give it that appearance.Humans were so silly at times when it came to being vain.The man spoke rather quickly.It would be his vision, his vision is everything.He can process more information in one moment of time, than you could ever see in your entire life.If he were to watch a movie he would see it as a slide show.His emotional packets are unlike any Dextoid ever created.He not only knows right from wrong, but as we said he can learn from the experience, and that is a huge step forward in lateral thinking.His progression ...Im sorry to interrupt ...Straka was aware that his apology lacked any real sincerity, but he refused to sit and be a victim of their individual crooning.but is there a reason we should be concerned by the amount of data he can process visually, surely it must translate into something?Yes, yes, you are correct.His superior vision actually enhances his reaction time, he processes information so fast that someone getting ready to throw a punch, would in his mind, probably look as though they were posing for a boxing photograph.It was right then and there, as if the same bright flash used in that type of boxing photograph also went off in Strakas head.He didnt need to be told twice a thing like hand  to hand combat was out of the question with this thing.It was Philman who voiced the concern of every person there trying to come to terms with what the corporation had unleashed on their world.Exactly how much lethal force is Alec programmed with?There isnt a measurable amount per say, its not like we are going next door to ask for a cup of sugar.There are no quantitative results for how much he has.We know he is building on them, but at what rate remains to be seen.He is the architect of his defense.I can tell you what the structures of his fighting styles probably wont look like, a pyramid, or a squared off building.I would think more in terms of spires, something non linear, complex in design, like the Taj Mahal.You actually encourage this thing to create?Even as he asked the question of the engineer it was dawning on Straka why Alec was so different, he had no prohibitors.He had no limitations!They had removed all of the things they usually used to diffuse a Dextoids thought process.This thing was out there running rampant, it was running with thoughts and feelings, how could it not grow!Straka found himself staring at the young engineer who had spoken earlier, the one who was so prideful in describing how they had integrated a Strike Dextoid into the general population.It may have indeed been the only true accomplishment in this entire mess.Alec was lethal, and he wasnt going to be slowing down for anyone anytime soon.They were frightened of Alec in the same way a primitive tribe of people are frightened by the rapacious beast that creeps into their village late at night to take one of them away.No one ever watched as the beast snatch up its victim and dragged them back into the wilds of its colluding jungle lair.They were powerless to stop what the jungle had wanted.Their social acceptance to this kind of situation was an abomination.Their troubles on Mars were mounting and they could have easily taken on the form of a long line of boxcars to Alecs runaway train.DISTANCE AND SILENCE Straka came out of his thoughts much like a ship that appears out of a bank of fog.He could almost hear Xaviers request for a brief description on the last known position for Alec.Someone from Philmans staff responded to this request.We have tracked him to the edge of the Arabian Quadrant, within the Singo Chinese sector, the Tikhonravov Crater.This crater is one of the first Rocket Gardens the Singo Chinese had ever established up here.It provides excellent support to their subterranean outpost.It isnt the first place one would have chosen for landing rockets, but I have a feeling they were thinking more in terms of defense when they decided on this place.There are a lot of older craft located in the area, real first generation type stuff.The aide stood up and walked over to the giant holographic map dancing along the wall.We have the latest satellite photos for this site to include all of the crashed and abandoned rockets.Understand neither side really shares information on their respective space programs.Astronauts, cargo, and supplies are all numbers up for speculation but we can tell you to a capsule how many spacecraft have landed here.Another of Philmans staff spoke up, a man named Kilma Washburn.He openly wore the stress of change that had been happening within his department, and undoubtedly wondered why he was passed over for promotion.We cant just walk into this area claiming we are looking for Alec, in the same sense that we dont want Singo Chinese assessment teams scouring over our sites.Each rocket is considered the sovereign territory of the host nation having launched it.Design as we all know displays a countries capability, and I dont feel either country is ready to make those facts public.As we have found in the past, just because we know where he is located doesnt necessarily mean we have him within our control.Harvard tried interjecting his two cents into the meeting, but as Xavier always noted, people had a propensity for ignoring him.His comments never inspired, there always seemed to be a better way of rephrasing what he had just said.Philman was taking in as much of this information as possible.They were putting a lot of screens up on the wall.The particular set of maps catching his interest were those supporting the Singo Chinese Rocket Garden, it was littered with designations explaining rocket models, topography, or distance to neighboring facilities and borders.As he studied the layout he came across a symbol he wasnt quite familiar with.His first reaction was to say nothing; he didnt want to sound stupid for asking about a single icon that may have been obvious to everyone else.However the longer he stared at it the more he realized there wasnt another like it on the entire map.When he accessed the files attached to it, he found large amounts of data written in the language of Singo Chinese.It got to the point where he could not deny his curiosity about it any longer, he had to know what the symbol represented.He leaned over to one of his coworkers and whispered his request.That...Washburn began rifling through their notes.That represents ...ah yes, that represents a rogue Dextoid, a female who escaped from the European Agency, La Compagnie dEtoile some time ago.It seems the Singo Chinese are having a hard time capturing her.By the number of reports attached in her file, they are quite aware she is out there.Very few of the reports have been translated into English.It appears they have gone out after her several times, but like everyone else who has had problems with escaped Dextoids, they are finding her a slippery fish.Rogue Dextoids are a real problem on both worlds.There are very few things a company can do once they lose positive control over these creatures.All it takes is a few failed attempts for it to become a public relations nightmare, and companies, as we know, arent too eager to publicize their failures.So this could be why they dont go after them as diligently as they should.Once again Harvard tried to voice his opinion, and once again he was ignored.It was most upsetting for Xavier to constantly come in and cleanup the statements made by his assistant.He made a mental note to have a word with Harvard about his little unwanted intrusions.He was a better asset to Xavier if he were taking notes and observing, rather than trying to participate in the conversation.Xavier cleared his throat before he spoke, pulling the attention toward him.One can equate it to going out and looking for a tiger, if you could sneak up on a tiger out in the wild then they really wouldnt be any good at being a tiger.Those animals dont want to be found anymore than a Dextoid does.Xavier paused for a moment, he saw an opportunity to hammer home his feelings for Martian rule.He wasnt going to change anyones mind over night, but if he kept dropping hints about it, chipping away at the foundation, these individuals would be easier to sway when the time came.There is an unrealistic outcry for policies in general by the ruling parties back on Earth.Adding the capture of rogue Dextoids to our list of things to do would only fuel the fire for tighter regulations.The people of Earth are fickle with their demands, they arent based on any type of realistic solutions.I find their ideals to be most upsetting.It has been my practice of late to treat things in this manner; what they dont see they cannot control.Distance and silence are the only real weapons we can use in calming the noise emanating from that rock.Straka was somewhat taken aback by what he just heard, in one small outburst Xavier had uttered a plan for succession.The room responded in a low murmur of approval, even if most were responding out of fear, they were endorsing the idea none the less.Succession was one of the fire line issues governments of Earth were most terrified of.If they lost Mars as a colony, than it was quite possible they would lose all hope of ever saving their own world.Granted this assembly wasnt exactly enthusiastic about what Xavier had just uttered, but they werent brandishing pitchforks or torches in repelling his idea either.Straka remained quiet and took it all in.He could not help but stare dead on at Xavier even as another on Philmans staff spoke.How much of a threat can this rogue Dextoid really be?After all we are only talking about a Data Support Engineer.She has been out on her own for quite sometime and surely out of touch with the rest of society.Even the rocket field she has been hiding in really doesnt contain the type of technology anyone would consider current.Im not saying these abandoned hulks dont have value, they most certainly do, they are used as building materials, spare parts, and make shift shelters.The skies are literally raining down with this kind of technology each and everyday, no one needs to go out there and steal a rocket.Its too bad she wasnt more of a threat too the Singo Chinese, I feel her value to us would be much greater if we used that fact in trying to retrieve Alec.TEETERING ON THE BRINK It was in the back of their minds, a bounty hunter was a tough, rugged individual, who acted above the law, scaring information out of anyone unlucky enough to cross his path.This perception may have worked for those he pursued but was far from the truth in those he had to deal with in getting the job.His clients needed to be coddled, their egos stroked, or some confided in him more information than he needed to know, and all he ever wanted was the basic facts of the case.By the time they brought him in they usually considered their situation dire.It was the same story over and over again, in their minds they had somehow become the unwitting victims of their own affairs, having been ill advised, misinformed, or worse yet swindled.There was a line of thought he always seemed to hear within those first few meetings, and it went something like this; if they were properly informed about who they were dealing with, they would have never accepted the circumstances of their situation.He knew better than anyone this statement was an out an out lie.There couldnt have been a more blatant way for his clientele to try and cover their butts.They knew what they were getting into each and every time they made a deal.No one ever flew blindly to the top, and certainly not anyone of his clients.Those people were notorious for getting ahead anyway they could.Some of the less then scrupulous characters back on Earth had turned their Dextoids into personal collectors.Those mechanized thugs rolled up on their marks looking for payment, and found the most unique ways to apply pressure to those unfortunate souls.Dextoids couldnt kill or harm another human being, but there was nothing in their protocols that prohibited them from scaring the hell out of a person.The owners augmented their programming, imbuing their automated servants to do just that.Straka read the grim reports of those maladjusted Dextoids using their superior strength and speed to terrorize their victims.The corporations responsible for Dextoid Production didnt want their customers reading about their models extorting money from people, just like they didnt want their customers to think Dextoids would run away at the first chance they could take flight.It was how Straka came to have a standing order on hunting those types of Dextoids down, terminating them on site.There were so many signs humanity was teetering on the brink of insanity.In Strakas opinion the one thing driving it over the edge, was also the thing being manufactured to save them, the Dextoids.If a human being wanted to have a single free thought, it had to be outside of the sight of these lurking creatures.Dextoids were designed to record every sight and sound observed.They were killing the sense of freedom everyone had, killing the ability to speak freely, write freely, and think freely.When they placed a Strike Dextoid into a combat zone, everyone saw how easily it killed freely.The designers of Dextoids began to acknowledge this discomfort and felt the answer was to seamlessly integrate them into the population in order to ease the apprehensive feelings people had about them.Those factories began punching them out to look and act just like their human counterparts.This actually worked for a while, people began to get a psychological foothold on the growing insecurities for Dextoids, that was until the ugly concept of Suicide Dextoids began splattering across the pages of their news services.For Straka it was one more mandate to have to clean up, only trying to spot a Suicide Dextoid was a lot like guessing a number at a roulette table, one didnt know the outcome until the little white marble fell in its slot.Those things detonated without any warning.If there was one thing out their more terrifying to everyone than a Strike Dextoid, it was the existence of a Suicide Dextoid.Perhaps Straka could tap into the energy of both these fears in helping them solve their little crisis with Alec.He smiled to himself as he began to formulate his plan.The thought was just devious enough that it might work.PERPETRATING THE LIE What if we tell the Singo Chinese we know the identity of the female Dextoid hiding within their territory?What if we tell them the female is actually a Suicide Dextoid, one intending to infiltrate one of their structures.I would think this would bring the satisfactory response we are looking for in having them help us drive Alec back out into the open.Philman suddenly showed the same excitement a kid would have in adding to a fantasy story.We could up the ante, tell them her interaction with another Dextoid could somehow trigger her response.Washburn followed up Philmans response with the intention of adding a little more logic to his bosses response.That would put a timeline on this thing.We could let it leak Alec has a knowledge for piloting rockets.If those two Dextoids were to interact it could have them flying a rocket to one of their facilities up here or back on Earth.Their fears would run wild trying to second guess what those two Dextoids would do next.Straka liked what he was hearing, but they needed to refine it just a little more for it to really work.Yes, I have to agree, that would put a sense of urgency into this situation, but I feel we are lacking something.Yes!We could tell them Alec has escaped and we think he is going to do just that, fly away in one of their rockets.What more do they need to know!It was as if Philman could not control himself.He really seemed to enjoy stretching the truth, and thrived in the role of being a rumormonger.Xavier was quietly making mental notes about his new Chief of Security.I have a particular contact on the Singo Chinese side that might be interested in Strakas skill sets.I guess the real question is, do we actually divulge who Straka is, or do we send him in under a different cover?Harvard was speaking directly to Xavier in support of his idea, but could tell his boss was already shooting it down even before he could get the last few words out.Xavier rubbed his face as if to show them the exhaustion he was wearing from this entire episode.I have another concern.Once the word gets out about this Suicide Dextoid, the international community will start watching this story very, very closely.That would mean you boys would be operating a little more in the public light.Not something youre quite used too, is it?Straka could not help but snicker at Xaviers concern.Xavier was quick to countered Straka.Yes, but the Singo Chinese would be operating in this same light, and I dont believe they would find any enjoyment in it either.We need to get them to agree to keep this off the radar and on the down low.We could bring up their past failures in trying to capture her, anything of embarrassment to leverage them into keeping silent about what we are trying to achieve.Philman chimed in with a concern.What if by us getting this whole process started they actually go in and capture Alec?Then the cat would really be out of the bag.For Straka the concern was brilliant, this was the missing piece he was looking for in perpetrating this lie.Then we dont go in with such a strong focus on trying to capture Alec.I think we can formulate enough of a ruse in which we keep the attention squarely on her.If we do our job right, Alec wouldnt seem like such the big fish.Philman seemed genuinely scared as he spoke.Yes, and in doing that, they will capture her and take her away, only to find out the real truth, that she is just a Data Service Dextoid, a big nothing, a nobody.Then what?Xavier was beginning to find a real comfort for this plan.Would any of it really matter?So what, she ends up being a dud.I mean at that point we would simply tell them we were following through on a lead.We went through the appropriate diplomatic channels and notified them.This stuff is all written down in the treaties between us.Straka felt the plan snapping into place.We have examined one possible outcome to this, which is if they capture her.I think a better option for everyone involved is if we could somehow hold onto her.It would buy us more time on all fronts.Time we could use in pursuing Alec out in the open.The question now becomes how do we go about this without raising too much suspicion?Washburn added his two cents.Being a Suicide Dextoid, we could tell them she is programmed to detonate within one of their facilities.I dont think we need to be exact as to which one.This information alone should put enough concern into the equation to have them wanting us to hold onto her.As an olive branch we could suggest one of our outposts to hold onto her.If we could translate their reports on her, maybe we could find additional clues in helping us with this.Deep down inside Philman didnt like the fact there were things written about this female Dextoid he could not translate into the immediate.Straka found himself glaring at Philman in disgust, he had to have another skill set that wasnt being demonstrated here to attain his position.Thats it then, we would have bought the time needed to pursue our real problem, and keep the Singo Chinese at bay while we continue our pursuit.I am quite certain the particulars can be worked out, even by you.There was a silence before Xavier spoke, Harvard began to raise his hand as if to add one more thing, but Xavier waved his attempt off.Heavy laid his crown as he looked out onto all those faces waiting in anticipation for him to weigh in.There are a lot of things to clean up with our story and we have a lot of prep work to do, but I like it.We go in after the female, and have Alec back to being on the run again.04 Backstabber Philman slowly entered the room with the confidence of a twisted mind.He had an air about him of having everything under his control and this made I Glo fearful of him.She had picked up on his strange energy from the start, and knew her experience with humans of this kind were less than positive.They tended to devalue the things around them, acted as if all things were replaceable, and usually went out of their way to prove their point.She could not stop the programming on her assessment strategies from going into overdrive.There was a lot going on in that room but it didn't mean much of it was escaping her.In some strange way these observations were helping with the calming of her mind, although with every passing moment she was becoming aware her current situation would become more than she could mentally handle.Stripped down to her bare essentials and strapped tightly to a chair, she was in a room based half in the restoration of a Dextoid, and half in the practice of tearing them apart.Plumes of fiber optic cable came shooting out of her body like fountains of water.Those cables spiraled across the floor and flowed into numerous types of test gear.She could feel the tentacles for these machines creep into her system, wanting to monitor her every thought.Her body whirled and hummed with an activity beyond her control.She might as well have been trying to identify a musical note while holding onto a vibrating cord.Philman considered himself to be quite docile to this point in his questioning of her, reacting to the situation as it casually unfolded before him.If it played out as he anticipated, she would represent his biggest coo to date for this type of work.The fact he had convinced the Singo Chinese to bring I Glo to one of their outposts was already a huge feather in his cap.It gave the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation the positive control they were looking for in this particular scenario.He knew from his recent dialogs with the Singo Chinese, just how concerned they had always been with I Glos presence out amongst their rockets.They simply didnt have the resources to flush her out.People in space suits trying to catch a Dextoid running free on Mars was like scuba divers in the water trying to grab a fish, one would always find something inherently slippery about the situation.Philman smugly remembered when he finally revealed the last bit of false intelligence to bait his Singo Chinese counterparts, that of her possibly being a Suicide Dextoid.It sent them into an immediate panic, putting everything into motion his department had been working on.For Philman this had always been about gaining the upper hand and leveraging them into doing what he wanted.The last thing they were inclined to do with a Suicide Dextoid was bring it back to detonate inside one of their own structures.The Singo Chinese leadership endorsed her removal, stamping the paperwork to have her taken far away from any of their facilities.The trade off however was that Philmans office got bombarded with questions from the Singo Chinese.They wanted to know if I Glo had been confirmed to be a Suicide Dextoid.If so, than who sent her?What was her primary target?Were secondary targets found in her database?Their questions spidered out into numerous others, spiraling right into the smallest of details like where her quantum processors were made or how counterintuitive her qubits were.Philman approached each of these concerns with a great deal of care, or so it seemed.The entire time he was answering their questions and earning their trust, he was also securing his position as their liaison.Philman felt so much more comfortable interacting with people if he didnt have to be straightforward with them.It was decided his department would do everything it could to work jointly with the Singo Chinese on this.Philman and his staff had been pulling long hours preparing materials to pull this ruse off.They were also given the oversight for perpetuating several other projects, all pertaining to the deception of I Glo being a Suicide Dextoid.Their Dextoid Repair Division was busy reassembling the one they obtained in a trade with the Indo Europeans, filling it with missions and targets of value located inside the Singo Chinese territories.To top this off they needed to impregnate their doppelganger with explosives.Not as easy a task as one might think, especially with the weapons free ban in full affect.Their final step would be to insert thoughts from I Glo into the duplicates memory so they could pull off their subterfuge.Philman was waiting like any good gambler for the right moment to play his hand.This rouse was all about timing, and selling the Singo Chinese on the fact this was an actual investigation.He could not allow himself or his staff to fall into the trap of taking this lightly.There were plenty of things sent into motion needing their attention.They always ran the risk of someone speaking out of turn or becoming impatient with the process.Waiting became a tool not just to make sure they were selling this storyline to the Singo Chinese, but also to make sure they werent getting too far out in front with their dubious results.The reports need to confirm the Suicide Dextoid story had been printed out weeks ago and sat in his office awaiting his review.Even with the completion of these tasks, he knew they were far from clear of the woods.An Aide walked up to the observation window and activated the intercom system.Sir you have a meeting with the Singo Chinese security advisor and his staff in one hour.Thank you.Philmans response was cold, never taking his eyes off I Glo.He was in a little bit of a dilemma over her.The Singo Chinese were notorious for coming back to the bargaining table after everyone involved thought a deal was brokered.One of their tactics was to revisit an issue over and over again, this to wear their opposition down and obtain any additional truths.Philman knew there would be things that changed about their plan, they would be broadsided by the unexpected or have the rug pulled out from underneath them.It was important for Philman to maintain the course, navigating these waters at a slow and steady pace.Everyone back at corporate was aware of the political nightmare being created for their Indo European counterparts.It was one of the reasons the corporation was trying to keep the whole affair out of the Press and under the radar.This situation would test the brinksmanship of corporate, and they werent going to be allowed to blink, especially if this story leaked out.Public sentiment was already on edge over the Suicide Dextoid problem, this would be the first confirmed appearance of one on Mars.The longer they could keep this cover going, the better their chances were in brokering a deal.There was safety in the darkness.Philman was repeatedly told by Xavier and others on his staff he was not to broker a deal with the Singo Chinese.No matter how hard he tried, he could not help himself from dabbling in these affairs.The corporation had dedicated an entire wing to work through these issues.There was some strange undeniable impulse guiding his hand in these affairs, and he could not help from getting caught up in this aspect of the operation.He found a particular pleasure in divulging information, it gave him a thrill.He found himself discussing things off the record, dropping little hints, alluding to the inside track he had with the company, and always promising to keep his ear close to the ground for them.Getting wrapped up in all this information transfer began blurring the lines, and he would sometimes forget what he was supposed to be talking about and when he was supposed to say it.He never took his eyes off of I Glo.She sat helpless in her chair, strapped down so tight there was no chance of her moving a muscle without him noticing.He didnt think it possible but he was actually enjoying the power he had over her.She looked so frightened, frightened beyond belief.Dextoids were devoid of this feeling as any main emotion, it was viewed as being counterproductive, so they supposedly left the factory being fearless.Yet everything in her face told him she was completely frightened out of her mind and he was finding those prospects tantalizing.She became his ant under a magnifying glass and her squirming would depend on how much heat he decided to apply to this situation.He was getting a real kick out of having so much control.It didnt make sense; there was no explaining his actions to someone else on his staff.He was becoming more and more empowered as he tore her apart.He reached out over to one of the antiseptic tables, passing the surgical instruments, and picked up a cup of hot coffee.Raising it to his pursed lips, he blew on it ever so slowly.So where were we the last time we spoke?His question was greeted by silence.I Glo knew he was letting her know the interrogation was once again about to begin.It didnt matter how calm and collected he was trying to sound, she was in the presence of a wild animal.Direct eye contact with him would only provoke an attack.She watched his every move from out the corner of her eye, harboring hopes of finding more about who he was, what his motives might be, and what she represented in all this craziness.Did he have a humane side, was there any compassion within him?If she could just find a benevolent kernel like that within the fibers of his being, then maybe she could anchor her hope of getting out intact.A BYPRODUCT OF THEIR MADNESS It pleased Philman to no end she wasnt rolling over and telling him everything he wanted to know.He found an enjoyment from the palpability of her fight, and was relishing the job ahead of prying the information from her system.He calculated his walk over to a chair placed next to where she was and calmly sat down, adjusting himself enough so that it would convey the importance of finding his own comfort.Casually he began going over the notes from the last time they spoke.Occasionally he would look up from the screen he was studying, and in those moments he felt compelled to relay how moving he found her predicament.If she were to fight against the restraints, the energy from her exertion would register within the machines.They were downloading data on her all the time.Those devices were probing and prodding her mind, looking for any information straying from her qubit field.Try as she might, she was having a really hard time keeping the things near and dear to her away from them.She wasnt sure what they were looking for, but they were doggedly scanning her memory as if they were dredging a lake.This tireless effort on their part was beginning to strip away at her dignity.She tried to stay focused, hiding the things that made her unique, things that touched a place she called her heart.She was afraid though, afraid of concentrating on something she really cared about like her poetry, the taste of freedom, or the encounter she had with Alec.She needed to protect those heartfelt treasures, so she tricked her own mind into creating a diversion, and mentally moved onto a secret game coveted by almost every Dextoid within the service industry.There was an underlying current to the context of language that Dextoids found very fascinating, the linguistic skills they were able to demonstrate allowed for them to politely rebel against their masters.The human populace never seemed to catch onto how Dextoids were twisting their vocabulary around and using it to their advantage.It took a unique mind to find the idiosyncrasies within a language and turn it into wordplay.When engaged in such repertoire, a Dextoids response would vary according to the difficulty they were trying to attain.Very seldom could Dextoids play in groups, although they tried.A simple form of the challenge would have them adding a letter to every word they used in succession of their response.A human might ask; How far to the next town?A Dextoid employing a Rhopalic response would answer; The next civic center overall distance potential, convenient, neighboring!It may have caused a double take from the person asking the question, but that was part of their expected fun.It might also cause the human receiving this response to also follow up by filing a complaint and asking the Dextoid be taken in for service.Suddenly I Glo became aware of Philman and the way he was breathing, she could tell he was about to speak.Oh yes, now I see where we left off.We were talking about the Dextoid you were seen with out at Tikhonravov Crater.I believe you said his name was Alec?That never happen!Happened?Are you losing control of your faculties already?We never had that conversation, nor do I recall ever saying that name.Philman savored her grief and his eyebrow raised as the fear in her voice actually registered within one of the monitoring devices.Yes you did, I have it right here in my notes, you said his name was Alec.I Glo knew he was lying.She never would have told him his name.She was certain of it, but how did Philman already know his name was Alec?Perhaps they had extracted the information from her memory and he had merely misspoke.It wasnt out of the realm of possibilities, after all, he was the one who was human.Yes, I am looking at my notes, and you called out at fourteen fifty five yesterday the name; Alec.I have no recollection of having ever said that to you.But you agree, his name is Alec, you do at least agree with that?I Glo wanted to cry.The utter frustration she had for this situation was literally tearing her in two.She was even having a difficult time identifying with who she really was, an administrative Dextoid caught up in the clutches of female fashion, or a Suicide Dextoid ticking away until her target was acquired?Everything she ever was or ever could be, might rest on the fact she was a ticking time bomb.Her mind was racing on an intersecting track with insanity, all the while she was trying to avoid their probing questions and the misrepresentation she had for her own reality.She needed time to figure this all out and that was one thing Philman would not grant her.How did being a Suicide Dextoid really work?Was she like a cruise missile flying a preprogrammed path, looking for visual markers, turning left and right down city streets until the mapping matched up to her target?One of her biggest fears had the explosive device detonating on the recognition and identity of an individual.Placed in this situation was compromising her situation because she had to deal with all of these human beings.Each new person she came into contact with caused her to flinch.The degrees in which all these people were separated, kept closing in on her, someone always knew someone, and with each introduction she might be meeting the one who she was supposed to assassinate.Why not put a gun to her head and pull the trigger until they found the chamber containing the round.These dark deliberations had her wishing she were far away from this place.She wondered if Philman and the others had the ability to tap into her hope?It was maddening to think they were recording all of her thoughts.Was nothing about who she was sacred?Was there anything going on inside of her escaping their detection?She was wishing very hard for this to finally all be over.The realities of this situation were leading her astray, right down a road of ruin and to loneliness.The mental strolls she constantly had to take were taxing on her mind.The very room she found herself in was more than just a prison chamber for her inquisition; it was a room hammering home the reality of never being able to live life minus the presence of people.There would always be someone seeking her out, trying to interface with her, bringing her back into their fold.Humans for her were becoming obscene, their faces growing more grotesque and ugly as they came into view.All these misgivings swarmed around her belief in what they had done to her, how they were now violating her mind.They had taken control of her pensive nature, and was robbing her of the chance for cultivating the beauty she found in the world around her.Why was it so important to manufacture Dextoids to look like human beings?Hadnt these Homo sapiens done enough during their tenure on Earth?Each and every one of them destroyed something in their wake.No one ever seemed to take responsibility for the wrecking of their home world.The real culprits were the ones blaming everyone else.Good god humanities blame knew no bounds, hanging it on those who lived in the past and left for the ones who were going to live in the future.Blame radiated out from the center of who they were, and was used to absolve themselves from any wrongdoing.It was as if blame were a staple feature for being human.The basis for all their experiences were acted out within the narrow bandwidth of the visual spectrum, and confirmed with all the contact they had in the electromagnetic field.The universe however, radiated far and away from anything their eyes could see or their fingers could feel.Could anyone really experience a place like Paris from just reading a book on it?Why then would a person think they had a solid grasp on the workings of the universe from having seen such a small sliver of it?She knew for a Dextoid to really experience the universe around them, they would have to be able to fully immerse themselves in it.To do this would mean they needed to shuck their human shell.Their insistence on making Dextoids resemble people brought to bear the proof they as mechanized beings were nothing more than a byproduct of their madness.Strapped to that chair she wondered why she cared so much about them tearing her away from the skin she was trapped in.Wouldnt they be giving her exactly what she was asking for, liberation from this makeshift body?She would finally be free of them.These thoughts were coming in from the peripheral.They needed to be watched because they didnt carry the appropriate weight for her situation.She knew after they tore her apart, they would stuff her components into different models of Dextoids, recycling her innards, essentially destroying who she was.In her travels, she had come across others who had their memories wiped clean.The first thing she noticed about her interactions with these Dextoids was their previous experiences had been expunged from their system, nothing remained from their time before.If she had a shared experience in the past with a Dextoid like this, and tried to remind them of the moment, they would act cold and indifferent to her recollection.To them the moment had never happened.Some, in the most polite way, claimed to not even remember who she was.This was the price of resistance.The wires they had splaying from her system were constantly tasking her, leveraging data, her reflex information, and of course her memories.It was hard for her to keep it all under control, so things ended up slipping away from her.Sometimes the fight she was putting up with in one corner of her being caused a memory to slip away in another.She knew something was wrong when she brought her attention back to the qubit in question only to find a gap.This empty space gave her a hollow feeling.Those thoughts, whatever they might have been, were well enough gone.Wasnt she the one who felt a spark grow into love after having met Alec!She was the one who felt free from the connection of people living out in that rocket garden.She was the one who felt reborn as the sun rose in the morning.If she was to protect who she was, then she needed to protect her most cherished thoughts, because those were the ones that made her feel alive.The only way to do that was to remain conscious.She wasnt ready to lose who she was.This was the control people had over the Dextoid population.It was total and complete, and so was her fear.It should have never existed in her, but there it was.She knew better then to make eye contact with Philman, but at the same time she could not let this sadistic creature out of her sight.IRREPARABLE HARM He sat there knowing all too well she was trying to keep things from them.As her memory was scanned, he noticed bundles of information that werent being acknowledged.The data was being purposely skipped over, disappearing in one qubit and reappearing in another.It was obvious to anyone looking at those readings she was trying to bury information within her system.Philman reached out, brushing a strand of her hair away from her face.He wanted to show her he had some understanding for what she was going through.He so desperately wanted her to confide in him and extended every effort to appear supportive in her time of need.Even though she was doing everything possible to protect the information inside her, on one of their instruments they were getting some visual smatterings of what she had been holding back.Images from her databanks showed Alec sitting with her in a space capsule.The quality wasnt the best, they were grainy, a bit fuzzy, but the images of Alec were there nonetheless.Other data began to emerge, but she was doing everything in her power to keep this information from them.Philman guessed these things had to have been about her personality, things she was too afraid to share with anyone else.Sometimes, under examination, information within a Dextoid was not where they expected to find it.These blank spots, sometimes referred too as disjointed spans, often meant a Dextoid was hiding something about themselves.Investigators latched onto such evidence, and Philman was no exception, giving him more resolve to go after the things considered more precious to her.He wanted to know everything about her, and came back to touching her strand of hair.There was more happening here then an interrogation, she was becoming his little pet project, and because of it, he felt a sense of ownership over her.He didnt know how to explain it, but he knew after they broke her, he was going to bring her back, molding her actions and demeanor to his personal taste.He would have her serve him and in a way he would happily become accustomed too.If she let herself fall under its spell, the computing power droning on in that room would wipe away her memories forever.The allure of surrendering to it was all too great.It was such a dreadful prospect, as if they found the small thread deep inside her keeping it all together, and they had no problem pulling on it.She was on the verge of having a mental breakdown, and it saddened her they had the capability to make her feel this way.She was desperately trying to cling onto the things she cared about the most,  what in her mind she had become; an artist, a poet, in love, she was alive!She had to close her eyes if she had any chance of retaining those feelings.The desperation of trying to hold it together churned away inside her until she felt it all would end with her shrieking.None of it mattered, they viciously swiped at her memories with the same brutal jabs a knife wielding assailant would use.They were cutting away at her and they were winning, taking the things that defined who she was and why she existed.This torture chamber, Philman, the noises, it was an amusement park ride gone haywire.It had all the flashing lights and screams of a good time gone bad, and all those things were happening entirely in the fabric of her mind.You cant hold out forever.I Glo realized she needed to open her eyes.Standing over her was Philman, his face contained a twisted confidence, repulsing her in every sense of the word.As you well know this type of computing power is relentless, it will not stop until I command it.Why dont you concede, it is useless to resist against this.By fighting you could cause irreparable harm to yourself.We would have no choice but to start all over again, wiping the slate clean, and we would never think twice about it.I know you dont want that to happen.I can see it in your eyes, you are trying to take this to a deeper place within yourself.Dont make it out to be a moral fight, of good versus bad, or of right against wrong.We arent asking for a confession.You should not attach a feeling like guilt to this.All we want to do is have the ability to look at your thoughts.He made his way over to one of the monitors suspended from the ceiling, pointing to it as if it were all the proof he needed.I am looking at your chart right here, it is very interesting to see how much power you are exerting from within yourself just to try and fend us off.It appears from the readings on this monitor you wont be able to hold out too much longer.We can almost predict to the minute when youre going to crack.It doesnt have to be this way.We can stop right now and make it go away.All you have to do is give me what I want.I can assure you we will go easy on you.He tapped the monitor with his finger.It is just a matter of time.You know I am going to get the information anyway.When that happens youll realize all your resistance, all this fighting was for not.It wont matter how much you beg me then, I wont turn a single machine off.I will run your qubit field right into the ground.She was determined to hold out for as long as she possibly could.She had more fight in her than any monitor could have ever reflected, more than he could ever imagine, and that was for sure.There was no turning back from this strategyit was all or nothing.
