Onor and Haric continued eating until all of the food was gone.A maintenance bot whirred past them, followed by a stocky older woman with a limp.Penny.She stopped in front of them, a hand signal stopping the bot as well.Onor leapt up, folding her in his arms, breathing in the smells of robot grease and cleaner.She stiffened.She always stiffened when he held her.Damned old woman, independent as hell.You look great, he told her.She stepped back, rubbing a spot on her head.Got a few new scars.A lot of people do.You went up in the world, she said.She stood still, looking awkward.I knew you would.He had missed her.He should have visited her, but he hadnt.He took her hand.This isnt your territory.Is everything all right?I came to tell you something.What?Theres an attack being planned.Other people want to be in charge when the ship contacts us.They think theyre running out of time.Ellis and Sylva?And more.I hear theres even some grays, although I never can tell.Hardly knew anyone before anyway, me living down low like I do.Now theyre all wearing whatever.He laughed.She had that right.Youre wearing a few colors yourself.In fact, she had on everything but gray, and even a bit of green wrapped around one of her arms like a bandage.Yeah.Do you know what theyre planning?I overheard a conversation about getting right into command.Like now, while were standing here talking.But I dont know how they plan to do that.They sounded tense and angry.He couldnt leave his post.Is there anything else I should know?Or that I can do for you?Well, one thing.Can you tell me how scared I should be?About the ship?As if responding to Pennys question, Ixs voice began its calm recounting from the speaker again.Three ships have detached from the Adiamo system ship.They are approaching The Creative Fire.It appears that they will arrive in less than two hours.Pennys eyes widened, and Haric stood straighter.Onor fought back the lump of fear trying to creep up his throat.It could be okay.One theory is they want to talk to us.Do you believe that?Pennys voice shook.Really?I dont, Haric said unhelpfully.I hope so, Onor leaned down close to Penny.Remember the first day I met you.The day you led me to get my beating?Hazing, she said, a short smile playing around the edges of her lips, and then gone back to worry.You didnt tell me what was going to happen then, but you did tell me this time.Im grateful for that.Youre my friend, she said.And youre mine.He pointed at the now silent speaker.Are you getting the same news we are?Yes.All right.Colin and some of his fighters were coming their way from the cargo bar.They looked determined, and they were moving fast.Onor only recognized one, Colins second in command, Par.Two were women.Look Penny, go back under.See if you can figure out how to turn the robots into weapons.We might need everything weve got.She reached in and gave him a little swat on the arm.Ill do my best.And stay safe.Probably not.Do it, Onor told her.Colins hand fell on his shoulder.Come on.Both of you.Theres nothing landing here.They snaked past Penny, leaving her and her bot pressed against the wall to make room.Shed be okay.She was tough.They started into a slow, sustainable jog.The sound of maybe twenty pairs of feet reminded Onor of training below the park, running and running for hours just to get in shape to run when it mattered.Like now.Onor spoke to Colin.Where are they landing?Outside of C.  Onor laughed.Something breaks our way?Is that good?Colin asked.Im not sure.Theres no one to greet them there.But at least no one lives there, Onor said.So are we going to greet them?Haric asked.Were heading that way.We might just suit up.Colin looked at Haric.You need to go back.Back where?To the cargo bar.You can help watch over it.I need Onorhe helped with the salvage operation on C pod.I want to stay with you.Harics breathing was more labored than Onors or Colins, almost ragged.Its dangerous.Ill be safer with you.Colin snapped at the boy this time.Its not safe anywhere.Go.Can I stay, pause, until theres some kind of information, Haric breathed hard, to take back?The desperation in Harics voice tugged at Onor, but there was another job to do.He matched his pace to Harics, the run clipping his sentences, too.Colins right.Go back now.Stop in the cargo bar.Tell Ix what Penny told us.That theres going to be fighting inside.Then go home.To Ruby and Colin.Haric looked betrayed, but he turned and ran back the way theyd come.His footsteps echoed, loud and angry.Colin didnt slow down, but he said, Thanks.What did Penny tell you?That theres people mad at Ruby and Joel.Thats news?Are we taking a train?Onor asked.Theyve all been shut off until the fights over.It was a long way to C pod.Onor settled in for the run.They stopped about halfway, ducking out of the maintenance corridors into a row of habs.The first one they found was miraculously unlocked.Or maybe a gift from Ix.They liberated some water and relieved themselves.Ix?Colin spoke.Any news?The ships are closer now.They havent contacted anyone.Joel wants Onor and Colin to suit up outside of C pod and wait to see if anything develops.More will join them.I received Harics warning, and it is a threat.What warning?Colin asked.Reds, moving in on command, Onor said.Why didnt you tell me?I did.Sort of.We cant do anything about it anyway.Colin frowned at him.Besides, its hard to talk when youre running.Later.Ready to run again now?You bet.Then they were off again.Onor started thinking details through.How are we going to get into C without the train?Well take a maintenance cart.Hed done that.A long time ago, Hed even learned to drive one.Should work.Tell me about C, Colin commanded.Its mostly intact.Life support is off.Waters all been moved, everything else worth keeping.I grew up there, but its like a ghost town now.Ship fell apart there?Was it really that simple?Thats what I heard.It was scary.Not sure it was that simple.Rumors said sabotage.I dont think so.Onor agreed.Me either.I think the Fires wearing out.Marcelle thinks it knows its going home.Is Marcelle your girlfriend?No.It came out more forceful than Onor intended.Someday youll outgrow your crush on Ruby.I dont have one.Colin laughed as he led them to the carts.Colin and Onor climbed onto a cart with two of the other fighters Colin had brought.It barely lurched forward.One of the people climbed off, and the cart moved much better.There was only one more cart.Colin appointed two more people to come with them, and sent the rest to do random patrols.There were suits near the garage the carts were kept in.Should we put these on now?Onor asked.Colin hesitated, holding up the suit hed chosen.I could leave the helmet off.Ix can talk through the speakers in the suits.Colin nodded.Well do it your way.He still held the suit awkwardly.I havent done this since I was twenty.So why are you going in?You usually send people.Colin grinned.Call it a little challenge between me and Ruby.Onor helped him, and then put his own suit on.It was kind of endearing that there was anything Colin needed help with.It wasnt like him at all.11     Ruby paced around the map table, nervous energy keeping her from stopping at all.She should be writing a song about this, a composition driven by the awfulness of waiting.Except she was sure they were almost out of time.For everything.Ix had locked up command, but Ellis and Sylva and their small avenging army was almost there.Even if they couldnt get in, she didnt like her worst enemies this close.The approaching ships were a far bigger worry, but Ruby couldnt shake the feeling that Ellis and Sylva might burst through the door any time.As she came around to Joel, he reached an arm out and snagged her.Stop.Youre driving me crazy.SueAnne wrung her hands and kept her eyes on the table, where the image of the small ships that had detached from the larger one grew inexorably closer to the skin of the Fire.Ixs voice.Theyre turning.They were.They changed orientation, a series of tiny shifts that looked a little jerky.Something even smaller left the small ships.Ruby tried to adjust her thinking.The Fire was huge, the ugly ship almost as big.Ix?How many people can those smaller ships hold?Probably a hundred each.Joel asked, Do we have a closer view?The table switched from what was essentially an illustration of all of the shipsFire, ugly ship, three smaller ships and three even smaller shipsto a camera view of the smallest ships coming in to land on the surface of the Fire.They were rounded vessels with small eyes all over themportholes perhaps.Kind of like the small, strong windows in the train cars.SueAnne gasped.I didnt know you had cameras on the outside.Ix replied, They are not as clear as my star cameras, and some are broken.They were meant for use while orbiting a planet.Something that looked like metal claws began to descend from the round ships.Where exactly are theywhat part of the hull?Laird demanded.On the outside of the cargo pod in C.  Why there?Ruby asked.Other questions piled on hers.KJ asking, Can they get in?and Laird wanting to know, Do you see anything that looks like weapons?Ix didnt answer any of them.Ellis and Sylva are outside the door to command.They are discussing how to get in, in spite of the fact that Ive locked them out.Laird glanced at Joel.Can we just take them?I have some force on hold.Joel frowned.Keep them ready.He glanced at the table, and the approaching ships.Theyre neutralized right now.I trust Ixs locks.Ixtell me if they seem to develop any plans that might work.I will.Ruby looked back down at the table.From this angle it looked like one of the clawed feet was going to step right into the center of the table.Then the view went dark.12     The suit stank of both Onors own fear and the stale sweat of generations.He grumbled at having to push the legs to move; if it didnt smell so bad he would have sworn the suit had hung stiffening in the closet for generations.He panted.Sorry Colin, Im trying to keep up.This things not responding the way its supposed to.Want to change it out?He didnt.It would cost time.Itll be okay.Its not like its leaking.Maybe it will loosen up.Two others had suited up, Par and one of the women.Most people in Colins employ had experience in the shifting gravity of the cargo bays.The four in suits would go in; the others would stay near the airlock and guard.Colin spoke to Ix.Open the outer door.Onors gloved hand was on the latch, so he felt the release even though he couldnt hear the metallic click or the warning bell through his helmet.He pushed the door open and waved Colin in.Two was a tight fit.Ten minutes of cycling later, they were on the far side, waiting for the other two to join them.The C bays were completely null g, and had been null g since C pod was closed down.Onor had been in them, of course.Hed practiced null g maneuvers using the myriad traverse lines that criss crossed the wide open spaces in the center of the bay.It had been a long time though, and for now he clung to the handholds on the ledge and tucked one foot under another handhold, trying to control his slight nausea with slow breaths of awful smelling suit air.Lights had been turned on.A few of them didnt work, so there were spears of light that went all the way through the cavernous space, and dark places that the light barely touched.The bay held many of the biggest cargo containers: Five times the height of a typical man and longer than they were high.They lined the outer wall, the one closest to space.Whats in those?Onor whispered.Ix answered.Ballast and shielding in some, minerals and dried samples of biology in others, trash in one.Trash?Medical waste.Had to go somewhere.Ix had sent them in after one of the strange ships landed on the outside of the cargo bay and began giving instructions to the outer locks.Onor couldnt tell from Ixs calm voice, but he felt certain that this was not supposed to happen.Random ships should not be able to breach the Fire, and shouldnt do it even if they could.This was no welcoming delegation of visitors, it was an attack force.It pissed him off.No one had invited them to touch the Fire.The lock behind them opened and the other two climbed out.Can you hear anything from the ships?Onor asked Ix.His own ability to hear was muffled to near zero by the helmet and the whirring processors and servos in the suit itself.Not exactly.When youre ready, traverse the pod.Other people will meet you.Onor clung for a few more minutes, waiting for Colin to get his own null g sense about him.Colin breathed out, Ready, and pushed off, arms stretched toward the nearest traverse line.As soon as Colin got a good grip on the cable and fumbled his safety hook onto it, he looked back to check on the others.Onor was right behind him, and the line vibrated as each of the other two landed and attached their hooks.Colin led the four of them across the bay, pulling in and out of beams of light.New lights kicked on near one of the entrances on the far side when they were about half way along.They stopped, clinging.Ix?Is that who were supposed to meet?Yes.Can you go faster?I can.Colin sped up and Onor worked harder, pulling hand over hand.He went so fast he fumbled once, floating away from the line, the hook holding him on.Colin gripped tightly with one hand and used his free hand to pull Onor back.Onor gritted his teeth and worked on precision as he tried to be even faster to make up for the short delay.Every pull felt like work.A spot on the inside of his arm felt seared as it chafed against a seam in the suit that should have been soft but felt like a dull knife.He glanced toward the other door.Three suited figures.He had no sense of whether there should or could be more of them, but it felt there should be more.As they reached the far side, hands pulled him in and helped him unhook then handed him along the wall.At the far end, he passed the third person, who gripped his hand as tightly as possible, glove to glove.Marcelle.He chilled, seeing her here.Whatever was about to happen was going to be bad.He felt that, felt it deep.Her features were distorted by the scratched helmet glass, but he could make out a welcoming smile below eyes wide with wonder and fear.He held onto the wall with his left hand, a slight push setting him to floating 90 degrees from the wall.She did the same, using the other hand.It set them floating belly to belly.They touched free hands.A null g hug theyd learned as youngsters when they were first taught how to suit up.They exchanged looks of pleasure at the success of the small joint maneuver.Ix.Watch the far side.The skin of the Fire.Onor braced, made sure Marcelle was braced.Everyone looked ready, and awkward.They bulked against the wall of the cargo bay.Onor felt naked without a weapon, but they had nothing that would work well in the awkward gloves.The outer locks were designed to allow the biggest cargo containers in and out of the ship.Lights showed through one of those locks.13     Ruby chewed at her lip as the invading ship that had stepped on the camera attached itself to the outside of the Fire with a wobbling movement, as if it were testing its stickiness.The camera angle Ix had found was fairly clear, but even zoomed in, details were tough to see.A second ship did the same thing.They are landing over airlocks, Ix said.The third ship failed to get a grip on the Fires silvery skin and ripped away so fast it seemed as if the ship vanished in an eyeblink.Ix replayed the bit of grainy footage.It was impossible to tell why this ships feet didnt stick to the Fire, but in slow motion it looked more spectacular that it had when it happened.One of the legs ripped off and tumbled away.The other three feet held on, flexing, and then lost their holds fast, like a zipper, and the ship disappeared from between frames.Ani put a hand over her mouth and no sound came out, although her shoulders heaved.Is it going to try again?Ruby asked.Im sure its gone.It did not appear to have enough power to catch us.She stared at the place it had been.Were there people inside?I dont know.The invadersthats how she thought of them nowthe invaders looked small against the big generation ships outer skin.The sheer surprise of them clung to Ruby.Those are the ones over C?Yes, Ix replied.Onor and Marcelle were there.Ruby wanted to be with them.Can they know?Ruby asked.That the habitation section on C is empty?I do not believe it is possible.Ani had dropped her hand from her mouth and it joined her other hand at about waist level, fingers twisting tight.Ive never seen you so nervous, Ruby told her.Itll be okay.Really?It has to be.Ruby spoke to Ix.No one from the Fire could have sent them information?she asked.I would know.Ruby believed.So it must just be dumb luck.Joel stood just far enough away that Ruby couldnt hear the details of his whispered conversations.She slid over by him and curled her hand around his arm, wanting to be close when something happened.Look!KJ commanded their attention.An even smaller pod had detached from one of the bigger ones, or maybe been let loose.It looked like it came through a door, although between the graininess of the picture and the angle, it was hard to tell.Whatever it was that came out, it had emerged from the invading ships belly.It grasped the ships landing legs.How many are there?Joel asked.At least two, Ix said.I cannot tell yet.The smallest of the ships bent downthat was the only way Ruby could describe itand clutched the feet of its mother ship.The center of the cluster of legs moved down and attached itself to the outside of the Fire, just above one of the locks.No one spoke until Ix said, It looks like it will be able to get in without hurting us.Like they have the right codes.This should not be possible.KJ spoke the worst conclusion.If they know how to open the locks on our ship, then they could have found a way to talk to us.14     The light that shone from the hatch illuminated nothing.It had been designed for people in the airlock.All that Onor and Marcelle and the others clinging to the insides of the cargo bay could see was the light surrounding the door, limning it, making the door itself look even blacker than the surrounding metal.It seemed to take forever for the lock to cycle.Onors breath rattled inside of his helmet, full of fear and stomach acid.He braced for the people coming through the door, for unfamiliar weapons.The inner door of the lock opened, pushed out by ...he squinted, drew in a breath: Pushed out my metal claws.Behind the claws, metal arms.Behind the metal arms, small metal bodies with thick legs attached.Four?No, six legs plus the two front ones with the claws.The thighs were thicker than a man, maybe much thicker.Strength and flexibility.He quickly saw that he should add speed to the words that the robots brought to his mind.Thats what they had to be.Bots.There didnt seem to be room anywhere for a human unless there were humans in each leg, and that made no sense.They were all leg and claw.All machine.The first one jumped, moving impossibly to latch itself to the wall at least twenty meters from the airlock door.Onor pressed closer to the wall.Ix spoke into his helmet.Dont move.Yet.They dont know you are there.Onor tried not to move his lips much as he asked Ix, What are they?They are not in my library.The claws are sharp.They appear to be strong.Understatement.Onor hissed.The first of the robots scuttled along the wall, using the hand holds and the traverse lines to move quickly down to the cargo pods.It seemed to know exactly where it was, to belong in the deep holds of the Fire.This alonethe familiaritywas enough to give Onor shivers.Three more came through.One waited by the hatch.Two of them followed the first robot and fanned out.All four moved in different directions.The first one that had come through snapped the straps on a cargo pod and lifted the entire structure of the bin away from the wall.What should we do?Onor whispered.Ix didnt answer.The fourth clawed robot started moving along the wall toward them.What do we do?Onor repeated.In just two jumps it had come a quarter of the distance.When Ix remained silent, Onor bit his lip to make himself think.Pain drove his fear deeper inside, opening up his airway and giving him more ability to talk.They were attacking his home.Ix.How do I hurt it?That ones almost here.How do I hurt it?Dont move yet.Its coming.You have no weapon.It took one more hop toward them, stopped.With no visible eye, he couldnt tell how it saw.Yet he felt sure it watched them, knew they were there.Can you jam the airlock closed?Block them in?No answer.They were all linked to Ix and not to each other.By design.So there would be one set of orders, and so Ix could control the conversation.It was a price they often paid for talking to the machine.Ix would protect stability and not individuals.Onor heard Colins earlier words inside his head, a truth hed resisted.But it was true in this case.The machine would sell them for the Fires future if it had to.Stay quiet, Ix told him.Ix must be telling them all to be quiet.He needed a human.Colin.Patch me through to the others.To his surprise, Ix did so.He could immediately hear Colin swearing, and the hard, fast breath of five other people full of fear.Stay calm!Onor commanded.Ix is going to lock them in if it can.Get out.Then we can plan.Colin immediately backed him up.Joe, Lisle, use the lock closest to you.That was the lock closest to all seven of them.It would only hold two at a time, and the two Colin had named were the closest to it.They were also the closest to the robot.Marcelle, Onor hissed.We could go across to the other lock.Her voice was shaky and high, but brave.It was a better idea than waiting.Only one machine was focused on them.Splitting up felt right.Now, he urged.Marcelle pushed off, a stiff humanoid form with a bubble head and nothing like the powerful legs of the machines that had entered their space.Even though he knew her as a warrior, in this moment Marcelle looked vulnerable.Prey.Onor bent down, crouching sideways against the wall, and followed her through nothing.She didnt stop to attach her hook but just grabbed the line and started pulling along it.Hook in, he urged her.No.It might follow us.Colins voice.Shes right.You might need to float free.Good luck.One mistake could leave them untethered.Onors arm hurt all over again, heating as it chafed.He drove forward with it anyway, the whole motion like swimming.His helmet bumped Marcelles boot.Sorry.Its okay.Heavy breathing sounded in their helmets, fear breathing from the four who hadnt followed them.A scream stopped all other sound, strangled, then stopped abruptly.Ix had cut the voice off.Onors fear grew.It was almost impossible to look backward in the bulky suit.It would slow him down.Whats happening?he whispered through his teeth as he pulled along frantically after Marcelle.What just happened?Colins voice sounded high.It ripped ...ripped Onor took another long pull along the line, felt blood running slowly into the arm of his suit, hot and wet.Silence went by for so long Onor was afraid whatever happened to the screamer had also happened to Colin.Onor pictured a suit cut in pieces, pulled harder.Colins voice vibrated in his ear again.It ...we lost two.Just go.Dont look back.Oh my.This was so much worse than fighting humans through the Fire.So much scarier.Colin again, his voice choppy.Good luck.Ill try.Colin.Colin afraid.There was no way to know what he faced, no way Onor could slow down.Can you follow us?he asked.I am.Ix, very brief.Go to the airlock.Get out.Now Onor could only hear his own breathing.Marcelles had silenced as much as Colins.The machine had cut them all off from each other again.He cussed.His breath came fast and uneven.He knew better.He took two deep breaths, tried to recenter.Looking ahead wasnt too hard.The lock was further away than it should be.He took even more control of his breath, paid more attention to the way the line slid between his gloved fingers.He couldnt tell if he was faster or not.It seemed surreal, the two of them moving along the line, Colin catching up.Every once in a while he could feel the pull of Colins arms, a tightness in the line that disappeared and reformed.He only heard his own sounds, the way he moved in his suit, the small grunts of pain he couldnt help any more when his arm scraped across whatever was cutting him.He glanced below.There were two holes where spider bots had taken cargo containers.The line in his hand jerked.The claws on the spider bots were strong enough to cut the straps on cargo containers; they were strong enough to cut the traverse lines.Ix?he queried.Yes?If we tie on, will gravity stop them?Should you turn on the gravgens?I have been running calculations.You might be harmed more than them by sudden gravity.Marcelles boots receded and he chased them.It might be bad for the ship as well.Nothing in this bay is used to real gravity.The gens should be ramped up slowly with handlers available.Stupid machine could talk through anything.Time dragged.Focus shrank to the feel of the line across his gloves, to the way his suit didnt move as fluidly as it should, to the cut on his arm, to keeping the same distance between his helmet and Marcelles boots.Marcelle grabbed the far wall, one hand on a handhold, then the other, then she was vertical to his horizontal, helping him.He wanted to cling to the wall beside the airlock with his belly but he had to turn.Colin was more than half way to them.Onors biggest fear wasnt true; no spider robot swarmed up the line behind them.Perhaps they were too bulky to balance.Two of the robots were by the airlock theyd come in through, one of them on the wall opposite them, and another down by the cargo containers.At this moment they all seemed to be stopped.Onor looked for the other crew members.There should be two other humans even if two got out.He didnt see them.He was back to only being able to talk to the machine.Where are the others?Two have died.And?Two escaped.So five of them and four robots, and Ix.Beside him, Marcelle inched toward the airlock and pushed the button to release the door.Opposite them, on the far wall, Onor glimpsed a robots claw slide over the line and close.The traverse linecomplete with Colin on it, slackened.Onor braced himself, tucking his feet into two of the handholds.He pulled.The spider that had cut the line started to jump.It stuck to the walls, avoiding the open spaces.Coming for them.Spiders had been a hazard to avoid in the game of Adiamo.In the game, they had been the size of his thumb.Onor kept pulling.Something moved down below and Onor risked a glimpse, saw a bot headed toward them from there.Closer than the one that had cut the line.He pulled harder.He couldnt leave Colin and he needed to get Marcelle out.Breathing hurt, his shoulders hurt.Ixs voice in his head.You can make it.Keep going.The airlock is open, behind you.Up and to the right.The bot was half way to them.It must be doing the same calculation, and it must think it could get to them.He gave a last hard tug and extended his hand, letting Colin float into it.He grasped Colins arm with his glove and twisted, pushing Colin toward the open door.His feet should have stayed locked into place, but when he twisted one of them came free.The stiff suit hadnt let him move the way it should have.He still had Colins hand, and he couldnt turn back.Colin flexed his arm, trying to pull himself into the wall.The movement pulled Onor all the way free, the two of them floating near the airlock, just out of reach of anything.The momentum they had went the wrong direction.Something bumped him from below, startling him.He expected to feel the edges of a claw, but it was a gloved hand, holding him.Marcelle had kicked off the wall with the line in one hand.Shed grabbed him with the other.Now she had no free hand.Onor held onto Colins boot with his right hand.Marcelle tugged him toward her, clasped his waist with her thick, suited legs.The fingers of his right hand slipped, the movement changing the angle of his head so he could see how close the other bot was, the one that had been below him.The claw loomed large as it came toward him.He flinched, even though it was too far awaybarelyto actually touch him.Marcelle started pulling.Onor reached toward Colin, trying to get a two handed grip on him.Just as his hand came around, Colin kicked free.The movement pushed Onor and Marcelle toward the wall.Ix whispered to him.Colin knows that three wont fit in the lock.He felt the hard stop as they reached the door, Marcelle twisting to get purchase and grab a handhold, her other hand coming around under his shoulder and lifting him up and in.Ixs voice said, Get out.Now.With Marcelle in the lock behind him, he turned to grasp the door and close them in, looking for a last minute way to grasp Colin and jam him into the tiny spaces left between him and Marcelle and the walls of the lock.He would need to grasp pieces.15     Ruby had stayed glued to the shifting pictures Ix displayed on the table during Onor and Marcelles long pull down the traverse line.She watched when the robot dismembered Colin.Now, not long afterward, her stomach still felt flipped and her mouth tasted dry and metallic.There wasnt much to see.The spider like robots moved silently around the bay, and from time to time they stopped by a container as if pondering, but went on.Marcelle and Onor were out and safe.That was the only good thing.That, and the strange robots hadnt been able to get the cargo outIx had found a way to jam the electronics on the outer locks and trap them inside.Thieves.All of her illusions of a grand welcome to the world of the video game Adiamo felt like a childs daydreams.Thieves and murderers.Colin.Damned machines.Colin.The robots gave her pause.Maybe the ugly ship would talk to them now.They had captives.She hadnt seen Joel since shortly after they got their first good look at the robots.Laird and SueAnne and KJ and Dayn were also gone.And others.Surely it was a grand meeting somewhere.Without her.Not that shed have missed seeing what just happened, no matter how awful it was.Surely Joel had seen it too.Hed know how violated and empty she felt.Even though the room was still full of people, the simple fact of Joels absence made it feel empty.Ani stood beside her, stiff and still.From time to time she gasped or pointed at a particular scene on the table, even though there was nothing to see but the robots moving around, and occasionally a piece of a person or a suit.Haric brought Ruby a cup of stim.His face had gone completely white and he looked awful.He had just seen Colin killed.His old boss.A man he had loved deeply, had looked up to.A man who had taken care of him.And yet he was thinking of her.Doing his duty.Ruby couldnt force herself away from the table, but she took the stim from Haric and spoke softly to him.Im sorry.Why did he go?Haric asked.The last thing he said to me was to run away and stay safe, but he wasnt safe at all.Ruby whispered, I challenged him to lead from the front.Ani shook her head.Colin never delegated the really hard stuff.Ive known him all my life, and while he had minions for almost everything, he handled the real deals, the tough negotiations.Haric pointed at the map.Somethings happening.A view of the outside of the ship had appeared, showing one of the locks.There were no strange ships attached to it, so it was somewhere else.Ix, Ruby said.What are you showing us?The best answer to aggression.Damned machine.She watched.Its not a cargo lock, she said.No, Haric sounded more alive.Interested, at least.Its where we keep the landers.How do you know?Ruby asked.She hadnt know that.Colin made us tour the whole inside of Fires skin and learn everything inside it.Ive been in every cargo bay, and every ships bay.There are three ships bays.Three ships in every bay.One is too broken to ever use again.A ship, or a bay?One of the ships.How did you think we got down to planets and brought up cargo?Harics voice had taken the tone of a lecture.Ruby laughed softly.I dont know everything.Perhaps you can tour me around some day.Id like that.The lock opened.There was no shot with an angle that allowed her to see what was inside.Light brightened and then three ships floated out of the opening in the Fires skin.They were almost the same shape as the biggest of the ships that had come off of the ugly ship: cylinders.The Fires landers floated long enough for Ruby to finish her stim, put away the cup, wash her face, and come back to watch.Ix?What is in those?Explosives.Things meant to blow holes in the surface of planets or moons to see whats there.She crossed her arms and thought.You want to blow up the ugly ship?If possible.Haric almost squeaked.It could blow us up, then, couldnt it?As always, Ix did not sound worried.It can probably blow us up now.The landers drifted backward alongside the Fire.Ix.Are there people on those?No.We have no trained pilots at the moment.Ruby only had the vaguest idea of what they carried in the Fires holds.Dead animals and chipped rocks and minerals.None of the places theyd been to had been civilized.Still, whatever they carried, it was the reason the Fire existed.Maybe were going to have to fight for our cargo, she said.Well, Ani said, thats what were doing now.I mean all the way.After this.Even when we get home.I thought wed be heroes.You are a hero, Haric said.The machine contradicted the boy.You are nave.Joel and the others rushed in and went directly to the side of the table closest to the door.They focused immediately on the landers, and since they asked no questions they must know of Ixs plans.As if they had been waiting for Joel and the others to come in, the three ships stopped floating and moved.Ruby gasped at the quickness of the change.Clapping erupted all around the table.She stood beside Joel.He looked haggard.It had been hours now since they slept and she wanted to take him someplace private and help him rest.But that wouldnt be possible.And here, among all of his people, only the slightest and most occasional of touches was allowed.What are our chances?she asked him.Ix says they are good.The explosives probably have to reach inside of the ship to do enough damagethey cannot simply get close.What do you believe will happen?Its out of my hands.Only one of them has to succeed.How long until we know?He frowned.I think we could fail any time.Lose the ships.It depends on what kind of weapons they have, and what they think we can do.They know more about us than they should; they may have anticipated this attack.But if we dont fail?When will we know that?It will be a few hours, I think.There are choices the machines will have to make.Dont you mean Ix?Joel shook his head.Maybe you could think of the ships computers as pieces of Ix.But Ix wont be making the decisions.What about the Ellis and Sylva?What are we going to do about them?I already did something, he said.He looked away from her.Are they in jail?Theyre dead.She went still.What did you do?And what happened to their followers?They tried to kill you.His spoke firmly, but she knew him well enough to hear the insecurity behind the strength.That didnt stop her from being afraid of what shed hear.What did you do?I turned off the life support where they were.Ruby felt gut punched.How many?Twenty two.Ix allowed that?It hadnt allowed them to kill during the insurrection unless it was self defense.Even Ix knew that we couldnt fight two battles.It picked the one that matters the most.It was a hard death.When she was a child, shed had nightmares about losing air and heat.Theyd all been drilled in the creche about life support failure, told there were only moments to leave anyplace the air was rushing away from.The warnings from the drills ran in her head.Get out, get to a door, do it immediately.Theres ten or fifteen seconds before your heart stops.Ix must have actually done it.At Joels command.But Ix had turned off the air.Ellis and Sylva had tried to kill Joel.Had damaged his arm, if only for a while.Inches closer, and he might have been stunned completely, maybe killed.Surely that was what they meant to do if they got here.To kill everyone in the room.She remembered locking eyes with Sylva.Rubys shot had been wild, but she would have killed Sylva then.Even so, this felt different.She stared into Joels eyes, searching them.Was he sorry?Was this just part of leading?Even though it hurt inside, what she said to him was, I love you.Laird came up and clapped Joels arm.Good to see the ships are away.Whats next, Captain?Joel kept looking at Ruby in spite of Lairds clear request for a conversation.He hadnt yet responded to her whispered declaration that she could accept the horrible thing hed done in spite of her own feelings about it.Her teeth worried her lower lip as she kept watching him, hoping for his face to soften.She thought she saw concern slip across his eyes, relax his mouth, give him warmth.But of course, now that Laird was here, he wouldnt say it out loud.He did nod at her and give her a slight, secret smile before he turned and smiledmore broadly but not half as deeplyat Laird.We need to decide what to do about the invaders.Make sure KJ rejoins us.I will.Laird turned and walked off, and Ruby put a hand on Joels arm.He twitched it off.Not now.SueAnne and Bruce came up.SueAnne looked exhausted, while Bruce seemed excited about the danger, almost like an adult version of Haric.Ready?Joel started for the door Ruby took a deep breath, and followed.She could help.Joel held the door open for Bruce and SueAnne.The old woman hobbled through even more slowly than usual, her footsteps showing the strain of being part of command during the attack on the Fire.Ruby stepped up to take her arm, prepared to help her get to wherever they were going.Joels hand on her shoulder stopped her.He shook his head.I can help.I know how everyone on our level thinks.Ive been in the cargo bays.She saw regret on his face, but it wasnt audible in his sharp words.Stay.You can see whats happening here, and youll be safe.I dont care about safe.SueAnne turned.She looked almost apologetic, or at least empathetic.Her words, however, were clipped and iron.Officers only.Ruby glanced from her to Joel.Both looked resolute.Laird and KJ came up behind her.She was going to have to step through the door and defy Joel or step back for them to get in.She took another deep breath, used it to control her anger.Even though every part of her rebelled, she stepped back, and watched Laird and KJ and two others go through.The door shut.She stood and stared at it, furious and bereft all at once.16     Onor jerked so hard on the lever that secured the airlock door that he nearly lost his balance.His breath came in great foul gasps that stank of fear and his hurt arm screamed pain at him, but what mattered was that there were two sets of metal doors between him and Marcelle and the robot spiders.I never want to see those things again, he whispered.Never.Never an enemy like that, never the rending of a friend into parts.Hed seen death, but this was death covered in horror.Colin.Onor felt dizzy remembering.He peered back through the lock, but all he could see was light.Ix?Yes, Onor?Where is it?Are we safe?The spider bots cannot open the lock if its dogged shut.Onor protested.They opened the outside door of the Fire.The outside.I can keep them out of the rest of the ship.Could you have kept them out of ship at all?I dont know.Damned machine.He wanted to say worse things, but knew it for the heat of adrenaline.He took three deep breaths, his lungs seared by the pain in his arm, which seemed to go to the bone.As soon as his hands stopped shaking too hard to undo the clasps, he stripped his helmet off.Marcelle did the same, and then he had her in his arms, both of them bulky in their suits, not really touching.There was no way to reach her face to kiss her.He ripped his glove free and stroked her hair awkwardly.Im so glad youre safe.Her face had gone white as bone except for pink spots on her cheeks from the exertion of pulling along the line.Her breath came in fast little gasps like his.Tears hung in her eyes.He closed his eyes, searching for something to focus her on, to get her back into control.The pain in his arm throbbed, demanding attention.It would do.I need help.A medikit.Back.Right outside the airlock.She was already turning.Are you hurt?A cut.Its bleeding.He could still feel it, warm and sticky inside his suit.Ill get the kit.He slithered out of the bulky suit, standing mostly naked in the corridor until Marcelle returned with a fistful of medical supplies held in a bare hand and one suit glove clutched in her gloved hand.She stared at his arm, which dripped red blood.You should have left your suit on until we got all the way back to a working hab.You sound like The Jackman.Someone needs to protect you, she shot back at him.What if they space the air in here?He grimaced.If the damned suit had worked, I could have saved Colin.Her face screwed up into an expression that looked like rage and sorrow blended.As she wrapped the bandage around his arm, the look softened, replaced with calm and concern everywhere except her dark eyes.They were steeled and angry.Hold that, she whispered, use pressure.She helped him onto the cart and found a way for him to hook his elbow around a rail to hold on with the bleeding arm so he could keep pressure on the cut with his good arm.Ix gave them directions.Marcelle turned out to be quite deft at flying the cart.If his arm didnt hurt so much he would have felt silly being out between levels in his underwear.As it was, it just meant he had to hang on tighter since his sweat slicked bare skin wanted to slide off the smooth surface as Marcelle cornered faster than he would have.Not that he blamed her.Every turn left the robots further behind.They rushed through the open space between cargo and the living pods, an eerie thin corridor full of supports and pipes and catwalks and storage.The images in his head were all bad.The worst was Colin.He could see Colin whole and then not whole.Over and over, like the picture wouldnt leave his mind.He barely felt the jerk as the cart stopped.Marcelle had a hand on his arm, and was helping him off before he understood theyd returned to the suit locker.His clothes were there, but of course hers werent.She put on Colins clothes, and did a second quick wrap of his arm before she let him put on his shirt.As he followed Marcelle up the ladder into B pod, he had to stop and hold on with both hands to keep from falling.She leaned down into the hatch Ix told them to go up, a worried look on her face.Are you okay?Dizzy.Come on, then.Well find a place to rest.She braced herself on the rim and held her hand down to him.It took him three tries to grasp it with his good hand.She had taken his hand a lot today.She pulled, and he came up the ladder, slowly, step by step.He crawled out of the hole and fell onto his side, breathing hard.Marcelle picked up his arm.Its bled through.She supported him into a nearby hab.They had no trouble getting inprobably once more a gift from Ix.The hab was empty, and smelled stale.She closed the door hard and double checked with Ix to make sure it was locked.He had to lean on her to get into the bed.His shirt was caked to the bandage.He barely managed not to scream when she pulled it free.Thats deep, she murmured.Good thing I brought something to close that with.She wrinkled her nose.Lets get clean first.Youve got blood everywhere.She stripped him the rest of the way without blushing or teasing.Her calm strength let him relax as he stood under the water and she sponged blood and sweat from him.Then they were both naked and in the shower.They didnt talk, which he was grateful for.It wasnt very much like Marcelle to be quiet, and it was what he needed.To just stand and feel the water.The shower stayed on longer than usual, recognizing the two users or perhaps helped by Ix.The water seemed to pick the fear up from his skin and wash it away one thin layer at a time.He left the shower before she did and dried himself off as best he could.His cut still bled, and he stained the towel.By the time Marcelle emerged, wrapped in a towel herself, he had stretched out on the bed with his arm flung up by his ear and the other hand trying to put on enough pressure to stop the blood.She pulled on her underwear and Colins T shirt and came to him.She wiped the cut clean with an astringent pad and filled it with a sharp smelling paste.This will keep it from getting infected.You were good back there, he murmured.Fast.Might have saved our lives.She bound the edges of his cut with thick, clear tape, then wiped the excess medicine and blood off his arm.Her fingers felt warm, gentle.That was the most awful thing I ever saw.Colin.I cant ...I cant believe it.I know.Do you know its not your fault?He didnt have an answer.If hed gone back to trade suits, if he had been stronger, if he had been more graceful ...She gave him one of her looks, the one that said no nonsense and listen up, the one that made him feel like a recalcitrant child.Then she said, You did your best.We all did.You saved us both by sending me over the traverse line.Otherwise, Id be dead, too.And you.Colin ...Colin hesitated when you didnt.You cant blame yourself for that.She was so damned earnest.Ill try not to.It felt like a faint promise, but not quite a lie.Colins death seemed so big, and so awful.She checked the work shed done on his arm, left her fingers on his shoulder.I get it that they wanted to steal the cargo.I guess we learned a lesson there.But why hurt people?Her voice sounded thin and high, like she might break.Why kill Colin?What did they get out of that?Her fingers had tightened on his shoulder, and the human contact felt good.I have no idea.We almost died, she said.We might die yet.Who knows what other surprises that ship has for us?I want to live.She bent over him and kissed him on the lips.He didnt have the strength to turn away, and before he knew it he was returning her kiss as enthusiastically as she was delivering it.She smelled like stale sweat and fear and concern, but it was also the scent of life.He could feel it in her pulse, in her lips, in the way she put weight on him carefully, avoiding his arm.He was already naked under the towel.The heat of her erased the pain in his arm and the robot spiders and everything else he should be thinking about.It almost erased the pain of the last sight he had of Colin.17     The mood in the map room felt thick and dark.Ruby sat on one of the benches along the wall, still fuming even though the command staff had been gone for at least twenty minutes.Haric had fallen asleep near her.His head and arms were pillowed on the bench and she could just hear his soft snores.She stared at her journal as she struggled with words for speeches.All of her phrases came out awkward, but it was better than staring at the map table and waiting for news.Even though she was shut out of the real discussions, Ix did occasionally provide updates.The last had been unhelpful; a reminder that while they were trying to blow up the invader, it might be trying to blow them up, too.Any moment could be her last.Their last.As if sensing her thoughts, Haric moaned in his sleep.There were a lot of people on the ship who knew less than she did.They would know enough to be frightened; rumors were social blood through every level of the ship.She shouldnt be writing about speeches, she should be giving one.Ix?She whispered so she wouldnt wake up Haric.Yes, Ruby?Can you broadcast throughout the ship from here?Yes Ruby.But I will not.Only command staff are allowed to broadcast from here.Of course.The anger fisted even tighter in her, like a screw being turned slowly.Where can I broadcast to everyone?From any common.Will you also run a feed for me?So I can see what happens in the cargo bay with the robots?I can run it to your journal.It could do more, but she could live with this much.Run the feed to Harics journal, too.And Anis.And make an announcement that Ill be talking.Tell everyone.Yes, Ruby.The AI couldnt feel, but she was almost certain it understood sarcasm, at least on some level.Ruby stood up quietly so she wouldnt wake Haric.She went home and took a shower and put on the best clothes she had: a pair of neat red pants and a deep green shirt with a blue vest the exact pale shade of her eyes.She circled her neck with multi colored beads and pinned her hair up.Remembering the unexpected hike through the below corridors the evening of the festival, she slipped on comfortable boots that she could run in.She stopped back by the map room and shook Harics shoulder softly.Wake up.Were leaving.Ani lay stretched out on a bench, her tall form folded and one foot hanging off.Ruby shook her shoulder.Come with me?Ani opened her eyes and blinked at Ruby.Whats happened?Did the bombs work?Theyre not there yet.We may have hours.Im going to my people.All the way to gray again?Ix says it will turn on a train to get us most of the way.Ani ran her fingers through her hair.The AI is spinning up a train for you?The AI is doing a lot of things it doesnt usually do.Like killing.But she couldnt make herself tell Ani about that.After they disembarked from the train, they jogged through a nearly empty corridor.A woman stepped out right in front of them, forcing Ani and Ruby and Haric to a stop.Women surrounded them, at least ten or maybe twelve.Directly in from of Ruby, Lya stood with her feet braced wide and her hands on her hips.You should go back.She had been beautiful once.She was only a year or two older than Ruby, maybe three.Her blonde hair hung in uneven strings and her shirt had two big holes in it that showed bones lifting skin across a thin frame.Ruby smiled as softly as she could in the face of Lyas continued deterioration.I cant.I have to go tell the people something.Only what you want them to know.Ruby signaled to Haric and Ani to stay quiet, and let out a breath as slowly as she could.Isnt that always what any of us tell people?What we want them to know?In this case, Im telling them that we are being attacked, and that we are counter attacking.Dont you think they would like to know that?You never told us you were going to abandon us.Even though she knew there was no point in arguing with a broken mind, perhaps some of Lyas silent followers could be swayed.If I were going to abandon you, I would not be standing here.There are dangers I need to tell people about.Theres always danger near you, Lya said.But thats not the biggest problem.Youve changed.She made a gesture that encompassed Rubys neatly clipped hair, her dress uniform, and her multicolored beads all at once.Too fancy now.Youve lost touch.Go away.And if I go away, wholl tell you whats happening?She waited a moment.Move.I need to pass, Lya.I dont want to hurt you.Lyas cheeks were stained with dark circles and she stank of sour still.But she was still stubborn.If only Ruby could get her to be stubborn about things that either Lya or Ruby could change.At the moment, she looked like she wanted to spit on Ruby.Hugh wouldnt have wanted to see you like this.All high and mighty.It would have hurt him.And he wouldnt have wanted to see you addicted to still.That moved Lya far enough for Ruby to press harder and pass.Im sorry, Lya said as Ruby pulled Haric and Ani through the crack of corridor that Lya and her followers didnt fill.Im sorry.Ruby wasnt sure what Lya was sorry for, but she couldnt think about that now.They were so close to common she heard the buzz of conversations.The big room was full, but people immediately made a path for her.Fear and anxiety echoed in tones of voice and on faces, and in the way parents clutched childrens hands.Each familiar face made all of the things that could go wrong seem both worse and more likely.They could all die.She pushed toward the podium.The crowd included people she knew.Her aunt Daria.Kyle, the man whod taken her and Onor and Marcelle in long ago, balancing plates of cookies.He must have been cooking long before the announcement.Maybe he did more for people with his food than she did with her songs.The idea made her laugh a little, released some of the anger she still felt toward Joel and toward the ugly ship.She liked the idea that Onor and Joel would be furious that she was here with no guards except Ani and Haric.It gave her extra energy to feel like she was breaking rules.But that didnt mean she should be stupid.She leaned down and spoke softly to Haric.Wander through the crowd and guard.Let me know if you hear or see anything.Make a circle, and check in with Ani on each circle.Try not to let people know youre watching them.Okay.Theres a man with cookiesKyle.Bring me one.And have one yourselftheyre fabulous.Tell Kyle I said thank you for being here.Haric looked very solemn.Kyle.Cookies.Thank you.Hed be discounted since so many people only saw or knew the child in him, and hed feel big for being asked.Ruby set Ani to watching her journal, and kept her close so she could signal Ruby if there was any news.Ruby stood at the end of the stage and waited until they quieted.You deserve to know whats happening.She told them about the ship and had Ix broadcast a picture on the screens in the room.She thought about leaving out the explosives or the worry that the other ship could attack them.She took a deep breath and kept talking.They deserved to know they were in danger.She talked for so long that Haric passed through twice, giving her the high sign in both cases.By the time she finished, the crowd was very, very quiet.People sat close together in family or friend groups.She wanted to stop and talk to Ix, to find out about the robots, and to know Joel was okay.But she could see from the faces looking at her that they needed something more.Ill sing now.Just one song.She sang Song of the Seed, the one shed sung after Bens funeral.It was the most hopeful song shed ever written.When she finished, she let a beat go by, then another before she addressed her audience everywhere on the ship.Wait with me.If youre just listening, and you want to be here, come if you arent on shift.If you are on shift, thank you for your service.Were going to wait for success or failure.Now, Im going to take a break and see if there is anything new to learn.Ruby stood at the edge of the stage for a few minutes and looked quietly out over the room.About a quarter of the people left amid whispered conversations and brief kisses.She sat down by Ani, speaking softly.Whats happening?18     When Onor woke, it felt as if he were coming up from someplace as deep as his past and as far away as the world when he and Ruby and Marcelle were children dodging reds like Ben through the corridors between workshops and habs.Marcelles even breathing drew him back to the present.He felt ...not regret.There was no way to regret becoming lost in Marcelle, being one with her if only for a moment.The comfort of it.The way it had felt right and inevitable in spite of how it felt wrong ...Marcelle snored.He remembered that from lying on the bottom bunk under her at Kyles.Her snoring had amused him then.It sounded better beside him than it had above him, even though it wasnt muffled by a mattress.He opened his eyes and watched her take little snorting breaths, shaking a tiny bit from time to time as if she were dreaming.She was beautifulher hair messy from lovemaking, the hollows in her cheeks filled in by sleep, as if they were caused by worry when she was awake.She was so thin the ridge of her spine and the low mountains of muscle beside it were clear and distinct.He had participated in an act that would change their relationship forever.If they lived.Ix, he whispered.Whats happening?In answer, a small screen on the wall at the base of the bed snapped on, glowing brightly.Marcelle groaned at the light and covered her eyes, not quite waking.She had rejected all of the pillows, so Onor stacked three up and watched as Ix showed him a view of one of the common rooms.Ruby stood on a stage, holding a microphone close to her lips as if she wanted to swallow it.The volume was down, so he couldnt hear her words, but her feet were planted slightly apart, her back straight, her head up.She moved fluidly, crossing the stage and recrossing it, her eyes meeting the camera from time to time as they scanned the room.She couldnt know he was watching, but she knew she was being broadcast.There had been a time when Marcelle was better with a crowd than Ruby.But Jaliet and Fox and necessity had made Ruby stronger.Now, in times like this when she wanted to make a difference, she not only changed a room, she commanded it.Marcelle groaned and rolled over, her hand bumping up against him.She startled awaked, propping herself up on one elbow.I didnt dream.Maybe you were too tired.No.I didnt dream ...you and me.He reached over and touched her cheek.No.She got up out of bed and visited the privy.When she came back, she sat beside him, watching the silent Ruby.She looks good.Marcelle mused.But she has to be as scared as we are.Maybe.He remembered being chased, which prompted him to put a grateful arm around Marcelles shoulders and to ask Ix to turn on the volume.What else is happening?he asked.Were attacking the other ship.Wow.Can we win?Onor asked.Marcelle snuggled in closer to him, skin to skin.She smelled of sex and soap and sweat.It is possible.Onor kissed Marcelles cheek.What about Ellis and Sylva?They were going after Ruby.Did you stop them?I did not.A fresh resentment of the machine jarred him more alert.But Rubys okay?Ruby is fine.You were just watching her.Oh.Right.So what happened to Ellis and Sylva?They died.How?Marcelle asked.Who killed them?They died of lack of oxygen.Thats all the information I have for you.19     Ani sat on the back of the stage, leaning against the wall with her journal in her lap.She was so focused on her journalpropped against her kneesthat Ruby had to repeat her question.Whats happening?Theyre just now going into the cargo bay.Really?I was sure Id missed it all.KJ made them practice.Ruby laughed in spite of the tension, maybe because of it.The hammer of an enemy hangs above us, and KJ demands a perfect, practiced pose.Haric had left one of Kyles cookies each for Ruby and Ani.Ruby bit into hers.It tasted like warmth and friendship, and smelled of the fresh herbs Kyle grew in his tiny galley.Have you ever kissed KJ?she asked.No.Get your journal.Theyve climbed into the airlocks.How many?Theres ten going in.From five directions.Ruby peeled her journal off her belt and opened it out.KJ will beat them.He has to.I cant imagine flying home with rogue robots in one of the bays.Anis entire body tensed, her face a mask of resolution.It must be torture to love someone who barely noticed you.Ruby was furious with Joel, but had no doubt that they would be together tonight.He needed her, and he would remember that.The small screen was much harder to watch than the map table.She took another bite of the cookie.All four robots had gathered on the ground floor of the cargo bay, or what passed for a ground floor in null g.  They huddled close together almost as if they were talking.KJ and his people cycled in through the airlocks.Ruby expected the robots to attack them as they came in, but instead they scuttled into four separate positions.The humans were less than a quarter of the size of the robots.KJ spread his people in two groups of four and one group of two, keeping as much distance between the people and the bots as possible.Itll be okay, Ruby whispered back, even though Ani hadnt been talking to her.It has to be.Be careful, Ani whispered to her screen.Theyre fast.Ruby glanced away from the image.People were coming in with blankets and pillows and snacks.Parents had children by the hand, some looking like they never intended to let go.A few stood by the stage, watching her and Ani gravely.Haric came by and spoke softly to her.Theyre frightened but theyre all okay.No one seems mad at you right now.No.This is bigger than me.Do you need a break?No.Thank you.Haric disappeared back into the crowd.Ix, what about the ships?Are they there yet?No.Ruby returned her attention to her journal.Something had happenedthe configuration was different.There were lines and chains wrapped around one of the bots.Two people were tying the chains tighter.One of the bots forelegs got a good grip on a line and snapped it and then waved it very close to one of the humans.Another human sailed by and dropped a thicker line over the freed limb.KJs people were far more fluid in null g than Colins had been, than Onor or Marcelle or even Colin himself.They must practice.One of the figures approached the bound robot.She would be willing to bet it was KJ, even though she couldnt have said what subtle clues she was getting from the way one figure moved differently than another when they were all in bulky environment suits.He held something out in his hand and fired it at the bot.It convulsed once and then all of the legs relaxed as much as they could inside of the chains and lines that bound it.That was ita touch and the thing had stilled.Ix.What is that.What did KJ do?Its called electromagnetic pulse.EMP.It destroys circuitry.A robot stunner?Worse.A tight beam EMP gun.It wont wake back up?she asked.No.Good.The camera shifted.A second bot had already been tightly bound.She watched it struggle and then go completely limp, shift from alive to dead.Shed never thought of robots as something that could be alive before.The other two bots had moved as far away from humans as they could get.One inched toward the lock to the outside, perhaps trying to escape what was beginning to look like a sure fate.She watched the next capture.The humans met together in a group of six, some distance away from the target.They separated, five of them moving in five directions, making what looked like a net of chain and lines.They pulled the bonds out from a large bag held by a single suited figure.One bot was under them and one was over them.The one above them clung very near the door to open space.They moved the chain in the up direction.The bot tried to cut the net of chain that was surrounding it in slow motion.It managed to sever one line, but all of the chain and all of the other lines held.It looked like it was trying to stay alive.Ruby had grown up expecting to be a robot repair person.Shed apprenticed.Shed spent hours breaking fingernails on parts and getting grease in the cracks of her elbow.None of the robots shed worked on had ever complained if she stopped them, parted them out, or put them away.Not one of them had thanked her for fixing a broken part.Come to think of it, none of them had ever killed anyone either, except one big cleaning robot that killed a child by accident when Ruby was five.And that was the fault of the creche worker, not the robot.Ix.Yes, Ruby.Ix.Stop them.Stop them now.I cannot do that.As she spoke, the next to last bot that they had tied up was stilled.She almost screamed, as if volume could make Ix understand.Leave the last one alive.Why?I can learn from it.Tell them, now.Its important.Now?You want to study it now?No.Have KJ tie it up and leave it.Ill study after we beat the ugly ship.Or not.It didnt need to be said.Ix stayed silent for so long it must have been conversing with humans.She was pretty sure it was talking to KJ and Joel and maybe also to Conroy, who was surely one of the suited figures in there.These were not the robots she knew how to repair, not the robots Onor had learned to run when he was working down below with Penny.These were more like Ix.Maybe the ugly ship was actually a ship full of sentient robots.That didnt make sense.But still, she felt certain these robots had not only demonstrated thought, but also feeling.They might be clues about what else theyd find at Adiamo.Her journal screen showed that the fourth robot had been tied up.It twitched in its bonds, as if trying to stretch them so it could free itself.It hadnt been killed yet.The humans were still in the cargo bay, still waiting.Her best hope was that Ix had really understood what she meant.That perhaps Ix had seen what shed seen.Surely it would be curious about other machines that could think.Ani looked at her.I hope its sorry the other robots died.When I think about Colin and the other two, I hope it knows that were three for three now.Is that right?Revenge cant replace Colin, Ruby replied.Of course not, Ani said.Thats not what I meant.But I agree with you.Those things dont look like people, and they dont entirely act like people, but in some ways they reminded me of people.They chose like people.Im glad Im not the only one who noticed, Ruby told Ani.She stood and stretched, looking out over the crowd.Some of the children and old people had dozed off.Soon, shed stand up and have Ix display pictures of the dead robot spiders.She wanted the verdict on the life of the last one first.20     Kyle walked around the crowded common room, bending down to let people choose food from trays.A few children followed him around.Ruby stood beside the stage, watching.She had sung two rounds of songs, taken two long down times, and even managed to close her eyes and dozebut not sleepfor ten minutes.Some in the crowd had come and gone with the last shift change.The room felt thick with stale apprehension.Children played in the bare spots.Haric stood beside Ruby.He looked tired.Of course he wasshe had interrupted his sleep in the map room after all, and brought him down here and given him a job.Did you see anything?Maybe.Not see.Hear.I heard a little fight in a corner of the room.Loud whispers.Your name was in it.One of the people sounded angry.Thanks.Which corner?The far left if you stand in the doorway we came in.Ruby glanced at Ani, who stood up.Ill do a round.Its time for you to eat, Haric.Were out of cookies.People have been bringing us food.I saved you some.She handed Haric a fruit, a piece of candy and a small stack of crackers.Any news?he asked.I think it will be soon.I hope so.Ix spoke through the tinny speakers on her journal.Ruby?Yes.KJ will leave the robot bound and functioning.It hadnt said alive.Ix, are you alive?In what sense?Never mind.Haric looked puzzled but she didnt take time to explain the robots or the questionable life of AIs to him.Any news about the explosives?One of them was intercepted.It went off, and destroyed the part of the enemy ship that found it.Ruby grimaced.Now it knows to watch for bombs.It probably does.Why dont you ever just say yes, you dumb machine?I say yes when I am certain of the answer.The answer is likely in this case, but it is not certain.She sighed.You might consider standing on stage.To tell them about the robots?I might.Is it certain that I should?Yes.She wondered if it knew she was teasing it.She obeyed, though, and stood on the end of the stage.There were at least a hundred people spread across the benches and floor, maybe more.Probably more.Some slept.She took the microphone and started to sing, letting her voice rise from low tones to slightly louder on each chorus of a popular Heaven Andrews working song.People stirred.Whispered conversations happened.Onor and Marcelle came in and stood in the back of the room.Good.A part of her released worry she hadnt even realized she had been holding onto.The speakers in the room popped, alerting her just a few moments before Ixs voice came on.Watch.Screens came alive, displaying a picture of the ugly ship.The AI wasnt above creating drama.For most of the people in the room, it was the first view they had of the enemy.Ix fell silent, and Ruby waited a few beats before she raised her voice.This is what we sent three ships to destroy.It is almost as big as the Fire.Many people stood, as if that would give them a better view.Others stood to see around the people who had stood in front of them.She asked, Please sit down, so everyone can see.Most people sat, although a few in the back ignored her request.Ixs voice.I will show you the trajectories of all three flying bombs that we sent to destroy this ship.Three orange dots showed up.They flew fairly far apart.One almost immediately connected with a similar sized dot far outside of the enemy ship, and then disappeared.That must be the one she knew about.The other two made it half of the distance between the place the first ship blew up and their target before one of them, too, winked out of existence.Ix.It will be success if the orange dot touches the ship.By now, she knew it would.She had come to understand Ix that much.Even so, she held her breath, waiting.The orange dot impacted the ugly ship, moved into itbarely, but into it.Penetrated it.It seemed like a small thing, but a few people clapped.Ruby clapped.More clapped and then more.The orange flashed red and gold, a simulation taken from one of the games people played.A piece broke off of the strange ship and floated free.Some of the smaller ships that had hugged its outside tumbled away from it, as if pushed by a force that wasnt visible on the screen.Everyone who wasnt standing moved like one to their feet, whooping.People jumped up and down.Children screeched and found their parents, showed up on peoples shoulders, clapping.Ruby wished Ix were human so she could thank it properly.
