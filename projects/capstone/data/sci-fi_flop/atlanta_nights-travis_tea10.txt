"No, darling, it must be as close as  possible to Grace land.It wouldn't be real,  anywhere else.And then"   she gave him a coy smile   "then, you can love me tender. ""Perfect!"he exclaimed."Let me make a phone call    I ought to be able to get us  there in time to get married before supper.And there's a great rib joint on Beale Street     if you feel like eatin', that is. "He leered and patted her buttock."Do you know somebody at the airline?"Sh  e was already on her feet, thinking  about what to pack.Did she have anything   white to wear?Then she realized it didn't  matter    she was going to be married    in Memphis!It was a dream come true."Even better, baby. "He blew a smoke ring, then continued, "Here's where been' a  cop comes in handy    I got me a punk dope smuggler by the short hairs, heh heh.He's  got a private jet, he owes me big time, and  now's my chance to call in a bi i ig favor.No  waiting' in long airport security lines for my little Maggie!""Ooh, Andrew, you think of everything,"  said Margaret.She turned around and  looked at him, lying naked on her deep carpet.Her enigmatic smile returned as she  stepped forward."Say, I just thought of something, myself. "She knelt beside him and  gave a shake of her medium short brown hair."Do you need to make that phone call  now?Or can it wait just a little longer?""Get me started and it'll be a lot longer,  baby," he grimaced, but she lowered her  voluptuous body to the carpet next to him, and soon they were both moaning again.It  was a long time before he remembered to call his smuggler friend.* * *         Their pilot turned out to be a slimly   built black man wearing a neatly trimmed  moustache and goatee and a peaked cap.He  reminded Margaret of an African American  version of Nikolai Lenin.When she stepped  out of Venice's car onto the tarmac next to  the smuggler's Lear Jet, the pilot looked  her up and down in obvious appreciation."I got  to say, you sure know how to pick 'em, Mr.Man," he said, with a throaty whistle."Did you ever doubt it?"said Venice, putting a protective arm around Margaret's  shoulder."Maggie, this punk is Cooter Bill    Delacroix, and there ain't a slicker pilot  outside the Air Force    specially when he's carrying contraband, which I've got reason to  believe is most of the time, heh heh. ""Pleased to make your 'acquaintance, ma'am," said the pilot, tipping his cap  ceremoniously."Now, why don't you two lovebirds get on board, so's we can get up in  the air and I can get this big ol' cop to Memphis and off'n my back. ""And bring home a planeload of coke, and I don't mean the drinkin' kind," said  Venice."Well, I reckon I'll be too busy to  stop you, this time.Just remember    I've got  the goods on you, Cooter.Treat me right, or you'll regret it. ""I surely do know that, Mr.Man," said Cooter Bill.They climbed aboard his  plane, with him trailing behind them.It seemed only a matter of moments as he ran  through his takeoff checklist, got clearance from the tower, and soon they were winging  west through the gorgeous sunshine, on their way to Memphis    and marriage.It was one of those days that just    made every pour in your body sweat, so  everything was so slick, so that you left cheek marks when you stood up from vinyl seats,  the kind you tried to wipe away quickly with your hand so no one would notice.But they  had to know because you had those stripes   on your thighs now.It was a hot like only  Atlanta could get.Callie Archer would never forget the kind of hot that day was.It was the day she knew that all she was  to Henry Archer was a trinket, a bauble,  another art piece like that weird statuary that lined the foyer of the mansion.She might be  no more than another car for the showroom he  built out in the barn, another train for on  the train tracks he ran around the tree at Christmas and across the living room and down  the hall and through the party room and up the stairs even to their bedroom.Trains and cars and he had a lot of model airplanes, too, like the plane he used to chase those dogs at  the park, the fat cocker keeling over with  a heart attack when the World War 2 Commie  Causey plane chased it around in circles.It had been so hot!Callie came home furious that the air in the Mercedes couldnt  keep up, and shed been stuck in traffic on the Beltline and found no one had thought to  turn the air on in the mansion.She felt desperate to cool off.Shed rushed for the patio,  thinking to throw herself into the pool, Versaci dress and all, when she saw them.Actually, just him.She  didnt realize he wasnt alone at first.If she had seen he wasnt alone she might not have  made the first assumptions she did.Henry was naked, struggling to maneuver over a lawn chair, his butt cheeks  clenched and dimpled as he moved, like he  was trying to pull himself free.For half an  instant she thought maybe hed rolled over while sunbathing and caught his member in  the lawn chair.She realized his age was    beginning to show in the coarse hairs and  wrinkles.She was on the verge of bursting out  in laughter.Everything okay, Henry?she trilled in that false voice she used when she was  trying to hide her true feelings from him.He stopped moving and seemed at last to pull himself free and turned revealing  that muscular chest and thick neck of a  body builder far younger than 60.Except, he was  60 and kept working out.Thats what had attracted her to him.A millionaire to marry  was a dime a dozen, but millionaires who were built like THAT.But thats when she saw  her husband wasnt alone.She let out a small horrified gasp and   tossed her shining black tresses over one  bared shoulder.Get out of here!Callie shrieked.The woman beneath him smiled at her saucily and slowly rolled from beneath  Henry, her green eyes flashing out her defiance as she threw fire red tresses over her  shoulders to reveal breasts so perfect they could only have been done by a pro.Henry did you BUY her those?Callie shrieked.Callie, its not what you think!Henry ex claimed as he stood still slick with the  heat of his passion dripping water like hed just hopped out of the pool but Callie knew it  was sweat because it was so hot, and his hair wasnt wet.You take me for an idiot?She asked.The woman nodded and giggled as she sauntered toward the floral Indian pink and green dress shed thrown over the bar, colors that with that red hair were bound to  look hideous.What could Henry have seen in  her?She had freckles, and looked like she  hadnt even tried to cover them.And  her  hips were a little too wide.She looked like a  good brood mare, but not like a thoroughbred.Callie was a thoroughbred, sleek and  finely muscled, soft where she needed to   be, powerful where she needed to be.Now  Callie noticed the empty wine bottle upended in  the coal car of a train, the empty glasses  set in one of the empty grain cars so that if   he flicked a switch it could run out to the  kitchen.Their clothes were scattered, tossed all over the patio and deck furniture and bar.The woman fished a hot pink bra  out of the swimming pool with the skimmer,  maneuvering the pole like a pro and acting  as if she hadnt noticed Henry and Callie.Ill call you, the woman said as she casually walked across the patio carrying  her dripping bra over her shoulder and grabbing  her dress.He red stilettos clicked on the  marble as she paced down the hall of the mansion lined with train tracks.Im sorry, Callie, I didnt expect you,   Henry grimaced, his eyes touched her  hair, following the curve of her glossy black  mane to that bared shoulder.If she took one  more deep breath it would fall, certainly, and reveal a breast that had yet to begin to show  its age.Thats pretty clear to me.Callie pointedly didnt look at him.Instead she was  looking at his groin, the offending part now   less bold.How long has this been going  on, she stated.Really, my dear, just this once.Youre   all I need.I rejoice every day that a  woman so young, I cant believe youre only  40, so voluptuous, so incredibly wonderful  could want me.I beg that you will forgive me    , stay beside me as I enter my golden  years.Callie felt the cold hard place inside her begin to warm a little and tried to force it  back inside her to cling to the anger she   should feel for the way he wronged her, right  here in her own house, well, actually his house, but like hers because they lived here  together.Shes younger than me.Callie told him angrily.I didnt even notice.You have to understand we were drunk.I was at the Polo  Club and I had a few too many drinks.I saw Ri chard there and we got to talking and one  thing led to another and they kept handing me drinks.And I don t know if shed been  there with Richard or he knew her but suddenly there she was.I should have known better.And she was there (I dont even remember her name, I couldnt even call out to  her when we had  sex because I didnt know it) and you werent, when that horrible fiery beast you know  so well roared up from within and consumed me.It was wrong.It was so wrong, Callie, I  beg you for your forgiveness he offered.Could it have been the drinks?He did appear flushed in the face.And there was  the empty wine bottle.And how many drinks had they had at the Polo Club?You hurt me, Henry Archer, she stated regally.Dont ever do it again.Henry could see from her eyes that she was softening her stance, that he was pull  her back and corral her as he had every time shed started to bolt from the paddock.She  wasnt a filly anymore, not like when he first spied her.But she wasnt an old nag yet  either.He liked it when she decorated his arm, when her laugh rose up into the  chandeliers during parties, when she screamed out her ecstasy when he rode her into the  wee hours.She was still a fine mare and he wasnt ready to put her out to pasture.For  one, she would cost him too much.Callie watched his face change, from the humble fear of someone caught in a very  great lie, to the defiance of one thinking how they might defend themselves, to that tender  look his face always turned when they had just made love.She forgave him.How could she not?Lo sing him would be worse than anything  she could imagine.If he died, that might   be worse, or not.At least dying would be  something accidental, or at least not his   fault, not like him leaving her for a younger  woman, a woman with horrid taste in clothes,  freckles AND red hair.Its not like she  thought she couldnt bear to live without him, she probably wouldnt much notice, but she didnt want to have to go  through all of this again to ensure he security.But she never forgot the important lesson she had learned that she was like any  other favorite toy that when  put away by a child, and that child sees a newer, brighter,  fancier toy right there where they can reach it, and if the childs judgment was impaired  by too much wine, might forget all about the absent toy.That was the lesson of the  Atlanta heat.She could never again sweat without thinking of that.I suppose you're wondering why I've called you here, stated Arthur Nance  seriously, peering over the glasses he really didn't need and only wore because they made  him look more intellectual and impressive,  down into the quivering cerulean depths of  the glistening orbs of the deliciously beautiful young lady sitting in a dusty brown chair  in front of his desk which   was also brown.Irene was wearing a black suit today that  hugged the curves of her body, which were in      all the right places, and in complete  defiance of the scorching humid Georgia summertime air that turned almost everyones  hair into a mass of unappealing frizzles or  else handfuls of limp stuff that resembled  nothing more than masses of overcooked spaghetti, she wore her long, luxurious hair the  color of perfectly sun ripened wheat loose and falling in shimmering golden cascades around her dainty shoulders.Her slender yet perfectly formed legs were hidden by  Nances desk, but he knew they were there.Nance knew perfectly well that Irene was   the last person in this whole tangled  mess he should be having such crazy, perverted thoughts about    I mean, even if she  wasnt half my age, there was the involvement with Henry, and now hes dead and shes  supposed to be in mourning.Besides, there was the whole nature of the suspicions hed  been having about certain things, which of course was the whole reason hed called Irene  in to talk to him today which had nothing  to do with the hidden passion that lay hidden  under that prim black skirt but was a matter of much seriousness and import.Yes, I am, Irene murmured liquidly,  gazing up at the doctor.Goodness, but he  was in good shape for a man his age!Just look at the kawaii way his shirt fit him.She  could just imagine the six pack he had under there.Apparently, being a doctor kept you  in good shape, or maybe he just played a lot of golf.Well, Ive been thinking a lot about whats been happening lately, ever since the  accident, Nance proclaimed, rising from his seat and pacing restlessly around the desk,  twiddling a pen absently.Its always seemed funny to me that Bruce Lucent survived  the crash, and Henry Archer didnt.He watched Irene carefully like a hawk to see if  shed blush or have any other reaction to this mention of Archers death, but she looked  as calm and smooth as an unused jar of peanut butter before someones stuck the knife in  (the creamy kind, not the crunchy, because her skins not lumpy like the lumps you get in  crunchy peanut butter).I dont think its that strange, commented Irene with a shrug, tossing a  gleaming lock of hair over her shoulder with  one perfectly maincured hand.Its just the way things are, you know?Sometimes people live and sometimes they dont.Especially  in car crashes.Well I think its strange, retorted Nance.I know you think its strange, Irene snapped, you just said it.Dont you want to know why I think its strange?Fine, Irene sighed, I guess I should let you tell me.She was starting to get  bored, and Arthur Nance was starting to look a  lot less hot, even if he did have that sexy  little moustache.Okay, Nance began.Setting down the pencil before he stabbed himself with its  point (he did this once, and it meant he couldnt work for days) .It hurts like crazy!I went  to the doctors and they had to dig the point out and everything.I think you can die of  lead poisoning if they dont get the point out],  he clasped his muscular hands behind his  back and commenced to pace around the small, windowless office.There was a vase of  flowers on his desk, and the petals were slowly falling off them.Its about your father.My father?queried Irene, looking surprised.Obviously this wasnt something  shed expected the handsome doctor to bring up.Arthur stared at her.Did she look guilty,  or just surprised?Despite his usually extreme perspicatiousness in matters of judging the  human physiognomy in times of stress, which ability came to him through many years of  being a doctor and having to deal with stressed and not always completely honest patients  and relatives of patience, which was stupid  because how was he supposed to treat people  properly if they didnt tell him the truth about there symptoms and stuff?Thats what you  go        Yes, Nance pronounced ponderously and withemphasis.Your father.Tell me,  Miss Stevens, what can you tell me about your father?Irene sat quietly for a minute and thought.Finally she raised one perfectly golden   arched eyebrow, and answered, Not a lot, really.He was always sort of distant when I  was growing up.He only really noticed me if I was bad, and then he only noticed enough  to punish me.He was a real baka.I suppose you  could say thats why I made a lot of the  choices I made, why I wound up the way I did.She sighed, which made her already  impressive cleavage try to leap for freedom   out of the linen blend prison of her suit  jacket.And briefly made Arthur Nance forget completely about what he was going to say  next.But then he remembered.Well, Miss Stevens.I have reason to believe that he was involved with a friend  of your late...he paused, trying to think of  a delicate way to put this and then giving up  because there really wasnt any delicate way to put it.your late boyfriend, Mr.Archer.You think my daddy was involved with Henry?Irene exclaimed, jumping to her  feet and looking alarmed in a way that Arthur  didnt have to be a detective or a doctor or  even someone who played one on TV to be able to figure out, it was that obvious.No, my dear, I didnt say that.I said he  was involved with one of Mr.Archers  friends, he stressed.A friend by the name of...Rory Edwards.There was a silence, and all you could hear was the beep beep of hospital  machines.This suddenly made Nance realize that the office door was open (because  otherwise he couldnt have hear the machines), and he rushed hastily over to close it,  thinking, Shit...what if someone heard that?Wh at if Bruce Lucent heard it?Of course he  hadnt gotten to the part that involved Bruce yet, but what if the brilliant young software designer had heard and had somehow made  the connections, even though Nance himself  wasnt sure that what he suspected was anything more than the flimsiest of tissue paper  rumors?That, Nance thought grimly to himself, would be a very, very bad thing.Meantime, Irenes already porcelain pale complexion had gone completely dead  white.You think daddy was involved with Rory?she repeated through lips gone numb  like when you go to the dentists and the Novocain gets shot into not quite the right spot.Yes, stated Nance, shutting the door  with a melodramatic click.And theres  more.More?repeated Irene, sinking back down into her chair.More, Nance confirmed.This is what makes it all so suspicious you see.No, I dont see.You will.Because Rory was in cahoots the whole time with Isadore Trent.WHAT?!?!shrieked Irene.THAT STUPID, GENDER CONFUSED  PONYTAILED FREAK?!Now, now, Nance chided, thats no way to talk about someone.Isadore may  have had some issues, but shes a person just like anyone else.He paused, and his  chocolate brown eyes glazed over with memory as he remembered another person, so  very long ago, whod had the same issues and  had been so cruelly taken away from him  because of them.Young people could be so  cruel, especially young people still in school  and surrounded by such incredible pressure to  belong, conform, fit in with a group    any  group, just as long as they could say they fit in somewhere.Irene had folded her arms  under her perfect, melon shaped breasts and was glaring at him.Nance forced his mind  back to the present and continued.This is what makes it all so damn suspicious, you see.Two men, one dies in a  car crash, one survives a car crash.Each has a friend    Bruces friend is Isadore, and  Henrys friend is Rory.And a common person they each know: your father, Irene.Isaac  Stevens, the one meeting point of all this  crazy insanity.Theres more going on than you  could possibly guess, and your father was right    there in the thick   of it, connected to  Isadore and Rory.Do you have any proof of any of this?Irene hissed, glaring at the doctor with  hate quivering in her cerulean eyes.Thats not important.Whats important is that we learn the truth.Proof can come  later.Well, I do not believe a word of it.And what about you, Dr.Nance?You treated  both Henry and Bruce.One of them lived, and the other one didnt.How do I know YOU  arent the common point connecting it all?Irene, you know that isnt true, Arthur   murmured gently.Im a doctor, my  mission is only to heal.I only want to learn the truth, not hurt anyone.Suddenly, Irene burst into tears, flinging  herself against Arthurs manly chest and  burrowing into its strength.Im sorry, she cried between sobs.I. ..I just didnt want to  believe it.Please...what are we going to do?Well do what we have to, declared  Nance, whose mind was now racing even  as he held the sobbing young girl in his solid, toned arms.Already he was beginning to  formulate a plan.It was a crazy plan, but he  thought it might have a chance of working,  and if it did work then everything would fall into place, like a house of cards collapsing when you put just one card too many on top of  the fragile structure.Well find out the  truth.A gray crepuscular light seeped stripily  down onto Bruces face.He blinked and  yawned.Whas happening?he murmured, rolling over to hug his pillow.His pillow!What had happened to his pillow?It was no longer his hypo   allergenic polyester fiberfill king sized favorite.This was a half sized foam rubber  hockey puck.Reflexively Bruce sat up, and was suddenly abruptly felled halfway up like  an oak tree by a sharp blow to the fore   head.He lay back, stunned and rubbing the  rapidly swelling red lump above his left  eyebrow.The ceiling had dropped!It was now  thirty inches above his face, a concrete ceiling crossed by steel girders.It was a steel  girder he had hit his head on.From directly below him a deep voice  growled.Shad dup, prison bride.Or Ill  smack ya till ya do, huh?From slightly further below    Bruce   had a good ear    an even deeper voice  snarled, Lay off you fuckin noise, you fuckin motherfuckas.Its five fuckin a. m.          Bruce lay very still, trembling.What happened?Who were these people, in his  bedroom?Rolling only his eyes around the      room, he took in his surroundings.His  comfortable bedroom had changed horribly.A barred window through which a tiny slice  of gelid dawn sky peeped.Concrete block walls, concrete floor, concrete ceiling, painted  shiny gray and adorned with graffiti in many colors.Without comprehension his eye took  in the scrawl on the ceiling above his bed.In  an indelible blue magic marker the gnomic  curlicue resolved into the inscription.Was it, could it be    had everything been a dream?!?"I don't feel very fortunate,"  Bruce complained as his friend helped him  from the low slung red car, "I hurt all over  and I don't remember a thing after I left that  bar over on Martin Avenue.I wouldn't be  surprised if the police didn't want to talk  to me about what happened.Not that I could  help them because I don't remember anything" he added as an afterthought.This only  happens on Dallas, Bruce told himself, whimpering silently in the back of his throat.What was this place?He lay on a metal bunk with a thin mattress almost nine feet  above the floor, a bunk from which ominous creaks and shakings began to emerge.Like  Moby Dick rising from the ocean depths, a     shaven dead white skull slowly ascended  above the horizon of his bunk.You fucker, this vision intoned, scowling.I was asleep.I was dreaming about little Mattie.I was warmin her baby bottle in the microwave.And  you, you fucker    you fuckin WOKE ME UP.One look into those crazy green eyes and  Bruce knew he was in the presence of a  maniac, a genuine deluxe homicidal maniac, little Mattie or no.A hand the size and color of an albino catchers mitt rose into view and moved inexorably towards his throat.Bruce  shrank back in the narrow bunk, clutching his  thin scratchy brown blanket and pressing  himself hopelessly against the cold unforgiving concrete block at his back.Conversation,  that was the ticket    cordial conversation on topics of mutual interest.Is this jail?he  quavered.Its fuckin Death Row, motherfucka, the Great White Whale snarled.And you  know what that means?It means, I fuckin waste you, and there aint nothin they can do  to me no more.Im like a desperate man, if you take my meanin.His hamlike hand  clamped inexorably around the neck of Bruce s pajama top.Bruce was dragged headfirst  out of the bunk and dropped like a dead fish onto the floor.Luckily he was still clutching  his foam rubber pillow, which broke the impact a little.Right in front of his nose, the  Great Whites pallid bare feet, seamed with   corns and wrinkles from too tight athletic  shoes, seemed to be the size of canoes.Goddam it, Bodine!Suddenly a pair of large flat feet, black as shoe polish,  slapped down onto the floor.The occupant     of the middle bunk had entered the fray.Cant we go one single goddam day without a scrap, huh?There was a solid meaty sound, the sound of solid dark meat hitting white Bodine  muscle.Bruce curled up small, hoping not to   be stepped on.Fuck it.You think just  because you got in on twenty fuckin counts    of serial rape and murder that you such  fuckin hot stuff?They keep on telling us black folks we got oversized sex drives, so whats a man  gonna do, huh?The huge black man glared down  at Bruce.Death Row is goin to hell, just like the goddam United Nations.Lookit this little yellow shit here.Its all this  affirmative action to blame.Show you an oversized drive, fucker.From his vantage point on the floor Bruce  could see the home made shiv Bodine  the Whale was flashing, pulled from his  waistband.Suddenly there came a clang of metal on metal from outside the cell.Chow call,  folks.Chow call.The wardens were coming!Bruce sat up.Keys clanked and doors  opened, one by one, nearer and nearer.Bodines shiv vanished like magic into the top of  his sock.The barred door of their cell slid back with a resounding clang, and the black man  and Bodine shuffled sullenly out.Bruce scrambled to his feet.Hey, man    this is all a  dreadful mistake!Im, you know, innocent.The warden didnt even look at him.Save it for your lawyer, pal.I didnt kill Callie!Sure, pal.And Im former First Lady Barbara Bush.Get a move on, will ya?Please!I shouldnt be here!Bodine shot a look of contemptuous pity  back over his shoulder at Bruce.And  you know little Mattie, that wasnt my fault.It was that fuckin two timin arrogant  woman, her mother.The razor blade    all her idea.Sure, Bruce said, his teeth chattering.He tottered rapidly along in the line,  single file, down several open riser steel staircases and then down a long bare concrete  corridor to the cafeteria.This was a cavernous windowless basement space, lit harshly by  the pitiless glare of fluorescent lights, its  windows shielded by heavy grates.A haze of cigarette smoke hung bluely near the ceiling.The trays were pressboard, the utensils  were plastic, and the plates were Styrofoam.He held out his tray and a server in a hairnet  plopped down a spoonful of something colorless swimming in greasy ichor.It was either  grits or scrambled eggs.The coffee, in Styrofoam cups, was tepid and so weak he could  see the bottom of the cup.He added a sugar and coffee creamer to see if that would help.Was it better to sit with his cell mates, or to find another table and hope he wasnt  joined by a child murderer or a serial rapist?Better the devils you know that the devils  you dont, he decided.But not too  close, and not too far.He chose a place at the further  end of the huge black mans table.At least he seemed to be unarmed.His cognomen  seemed to be Pericles, and he was joined by a number of compatriots who lit cigarettes  and rapidly scarfed down the food.Bruce could only pick at his own plate.I have to get  out of here, he told himself.I have to talk to my lawyer!We have to fight this all the way  to the Supreme Court!Suddenly Bodine sauntered up to their table.First Im going to gut you like a  fuckin trout, he announced.Then Im going to pound the little snots head in, for  dessert.Pericles seemed unimpressed.You bore me, man.Bodine picked up Bruces nearly untouched plate and threw it like a Frisbee.Gray  goop flew everywhere, but there was enough stuck on that when the plate hit Pericles it  glopped down his T shirt front.Without visible   effort Pericles picked up his chair and  slung it at Bodine.All around them the other inmates stood   up and yelled for blood.Plates, cups,  chairs and food flew through the air.Bruce  prudently abandoned his seat and crept under  the table.Irene checked her face in the mirror and the gun in her handbag just once more  before she  found the reserve she was looking  for in herself.Popping in a fresh breath  mint (just in case), she pushed open the boardroom door to confront the three people who  had ruined her life and killed her love.Her father, Isaac Stevens, turned quickly, sloshing the  whisky (a wonderful  single malt) from his glass."Dammit girl !, I taught you to knock when entering a room.All good women know that!""Yes father I do know to knock, but then I didn't have the bad manners to plot to  kill my best friend and my business partner then, did I?"The two other people in the room took a  sudden greater interest in this new  conversation.Penelope and Rory stood too close for  a casual chat, and the lipstick smears on  Rory's face seemed to give rise to the evidence that these two at least had been quietly  occupied as Isaac got celebratory drunk."Well.Well.The little missy's gone and got  herself into a bit  of a fit now ain't  she?snipped Rory as he slipped his arm around Penelope's slim waist."What ya trying  to say gal?"Irene suddenly realized that her plan to scare her father into confessing the  attempted murder of Bruce and the accidental death of her lover Henry might have one or  two flaws to it.She hadn't realized that all three had been plotting this coup for months  and now she would just be one more pretty little speed bump on their road to riches.As  this kernel of truth popped open, Irene reached into her purse to grab the gun, but  strong  feelings of misgiving began to overwhelm her.Could she shoot her father, the man who  had raised her since her mother's untimely demise?Rory dropped his hold of the luscious Penelope's waist and lunged for Irene sure  that he, the big strong man that he was,   could stop this tiny girl from going or doing  anything.His eyes gleamed evilly, until suddenly, they took on a look of surprise.The  hand that had so recently been fondling Penelope's besom, now clutched his own  bleeding midsection as he dropped to his    knees on the overly expensive Persian rug."She shot me, that damn bitch daughter of yoren shot me!"And with that exclamation,  he pitched face forward with an "OOF!".Irene nudged his head with her perfectly pedicure right foot.He didn't seem to  notice, so she figured he was dead.Good, one less problem to worry me.she thought."What in the hell so ya think you are    doing?"shouted Isaac, fear causing his  voice to waver a bit."Now you've gone way beyond any manners they taught you at that  fancy boarding school I sent ya to!""You just do not shoot people, that's not proper!"So, thought Irene, this is what real power   feels like.I like it!And with that  thought she raised the gun and pointed it at the remaining two.She waved the gun  casually, between the two like a lazy band conductor  in 2 / 2 time."Now Father, tell me again how mother died in that car fire.You know, the one  in which your brother was not really there?And how sorry you were that  Henry, your  oldest and dearest friend, father of your grandchildren to be, died in that same little  accident, and how that left you temporarily    in charge of Bruce's company.Oh and  Penelope, how many beds did it take to line this up?Did you enjoy my dad ?What is it  with you and these old rich bastardy?""Actually, You were much more fun sweetie.These old guys just can't measure  up.Remember the trip to the Bahamas and that beach?"Penelope slowly moved  forward witheach word, distancing herself from Isaac ."We sure rocked that world.I'll  never forget how you said we should never come back to Atlanta, and how we could live  there forever on your trust fund. "Penelope reached a hand out to Irene and  tried to  reach out and stroke her cheek."Forget the Bahamas bitch!Irene slapped Penelope's hand away."You left me  there to rot and next I knew I was paying bail and bribes for some stolen jewelry!And,  dammit, I didn't even get to enjoy any of it!"Irene spit the words into Penelope face as the gun spit three rounds into her gut."How's  it feel to die a piece at a time, one bullet  for each day I spent in jail for you!This is all you'll ever get from me!""Reeenee baby, sweetheart,  now don't   shoot your daddy, we can come to an  understanding, can't we?'Isaac sniveled as   he dropped to his knees in front of his  daughter."Don't call me that!You ain't got no right s to use Mama's name far me. "Irene's  accent tore through as her tears began to fall.   "Daddy, I don't wanna kill ya, but If'n you  don't die, then I know y'all just find a way to get rid of me and the babies. ""No, honey.Give me a chance and we can fix all this up in no time.We'll keep to  the plan and take the company, that feel Bruce'll never figure out it was us until we 're off  living the good life in Europe with his money.How's that with you?I control all the  company and most of the shares, so we can ha ve it all and be gone in a week.So, Please  don't shoot me!"Isaac crawled toward his daughter pleading for his life and thinking that  he could get the gun away when the other two fools couldn't."Fuck off  Father!Die like a man!Not the crawling worm I've come to know!"BANG!BANG!Two more shots tore thought the carpet.Isaac cowered down hands  over his head and began to shake.Irene smiled."Well daddy, guess this  is goodbye, Kiss kiss Hugs, Tata.BANG!One more shot rang out and Isaac's very expensive toupee took a wild leap from his now  bald and bleeding head.Irene sat back to take in her handiwork.Three very dead bodies lay around the  room, each with a different expression  on what was left of their respective faces.Irene noticed a smudge of blood on the tip of her toe and bent down to wipe it off.She used the hanky from Rory's breast pocket as he no longer needed it.Bruce rolled into the room."Great work my love,  I'll have my people clean this  up and we need never bother with this again.Now go get cleaned up, we have a  meeting of the board of directors in an   hour and I need my new Senior VP ready to  shine!""I'll see you in ten babe!Got those tickets ready for Barcelona?""Sure do and then 3 weeks on the French      Riviera, then pop home and get the  nursery ready for our boys!""Isn't life great when ya got all the m oney and no scruples?"and they laughed as  they left the gory scene to the clean up crew.Inside Richard Isaacs.Outside  below  so far  Atlanta.Teaming urban sprawl, Boeings and LearJets  circling like buzzards to the corporate stink  of carrion, cruising hot thermal of greed.Old  jets never die, they just go into a holding pattern over Atlanta.Can it be that it's life itself  that's the holding pattern?Somewhere out there  down there  misted  by the steamy fog of his heated breath  on the cool air conditioned glass  Margaret Eastman's curves fill the tight stretched  spandex city with their Silicone bounty.Shouldn't that be enough to live for?Shouldn't  it?Shouldn't it?Not.If.He.Couldn't.Have.Her.Inside the ghostly reflection of the office window.The shadow of a man.Richard  Isaacs, superimposed on the crawling city.A giant over an anthill.A giant ready to lay down on that an thill and pour honey on itself and let it eat  him alive.Like it hadn't already tried.How far he'd grown from little Richie Isaacs the kid everyone loved to pick on!The kid who stole a bag of apples for the teacher from the tree in the Johnson's yard.The  kid who nobody ever knew put the rocks in Mr.Miller's garden hose or the Kool Aid in  the principle's gas tank or the prank calls  to random names in the phonebook to ask if the  Bowels were there or did they move.O h, he was a tricky little devil.Nobody ever put  one over on little Richie Isaacs.How did it all come to this?Was it the abuse of the priest  at the First Baptist Church with the red silk Cossack around his neck announcing his  corrupt virtue for no one to see?Was it Pop taking the belt to him between belts from  quart bottles of Rheingold?Was it Uncle Jeb turning into the driveway to pulverize his  beloved Lionel Trains under the cruel wheel s of the old John Deer?Was it Ma on the  creaky porch in her frumpy house dress and pink slippers and curlers sipping Mint Juleps  like there was no care in all the world?Oh,  mama!he thought sadly.I'm so sorry I never  went to your funeral!How did it ever come to this for Missus Isaac's best baby boy?The well built man surveyed his office       environs in a reverie that was so  uncharacteristic for him.The designer furniture  that looked like they carved it from the  iceberg that sank the Titanic.The abstract   impressionist original on the wall that he  always thought looked like Ed what's his name from the movie version.The bank of T. V.  screens showing MS NBC, the financial feeds.The antique globe he liked to spin and  trail his finger over it to get a tactical sensation of the mountains and the valleys rising  and falling like a graph of today's Dow.His fingers ...His fingers ...Looking at his hands, the backs of which were  beginning to show age spots like rust  rust  which forms not on peach trees, not on living  growing things,  things that soak up decay ing putrid soil and drank lemony sunlight and  gave back the breath of life, but rather rust  which forms on iron, things of cold and metal  hardness, Richard's fingers were perversely aware of the power they held.To manipulate.To mold.To force, with their iron cold meta  l hardness, the objects of their will in the  direction they willed them.A few taps of  these fingertips on the right keys on the right  board at the right moment  lives were ruined.Buy low, sell high.Every thing has a price.Richard Isaccs's was higher than he knew.Holding the metaphor in his palms, all the  blood drained from his sanguine face.His hands could kill.Him.His hands could kill him.Ye gods, what terrible power!Should he do it?he wondered.It wasn't like the motivation wasn't nonexistent.Despair was kudzu.Choking creeping ravenous  kudzu, nothing to do but to napalm it.You had your bull markets of the soul and bear markets.Crashes and depressions  and he  wasn't talking about the kind of crash Bruce Lucent lost his shorts in.Sometimes one had no choice but to realize the loss.Sometimes a guy hadda take the cosmic tax deduction in  the sky.You didn't always get an option or a choice or another alternative.This could be it.The big correction ...All umpteen shrieking stories ...It was not to be.Damned sealed glass, damned climate control, damned  transparent prison  or maybe a phone cord around the neck, he reflected, however there  was nowhere to hang from in this sterile plastic state of the art environmentally correct   eco friendly cage, goddam Eurotrash designers  claimed they thought of everything but  they didn't think of  this now did they, space didn't have  every modern amenity, couldn't  gas yourself in a General Electric microwav e, didn't suppose he could buzz down to the  lobby and request a halfway decent sprinkler head to hang his sorry gullet on, but  couldn't you rig something through the cord, twist a ruler through it, couldn't you tighten  it yourself?Turning and torquing and winding,  tighter and tighter, muscles straining in  his merciless shoulders, cranking a bulwark closed on a sinking ship  would he have the  balls to go through with it, wring the breat h from his own gasping throat?Would he  plead for his life, would he say: "Dick, for  God sakes, don't do this, you have so much to  live for, don't be a fool, don't throw your lif e away?"Would those hands, his iron hands,  his terrible aging rust corroded sin stained  hands take on their own DoctorStrangelovian  personality, could nothing he say deter them from their inexorable will?He wrestled his stygian urges down with Herculean aplomb.Got a hold of himself.Control.Control he could do.Alright.No Dopplering dotcom plummet       to eat a terminal snack of pigeon   flavored pavement after the dead cat     bounce.No jolt of autocratic asphyxiation,  wrenching the Apex Data Ruler the way he   wrenched himself in the wee of the night  when he lay prostate on his back and no one  could hear him ejaculate Margaret's name  into the Sealy Serta mattress drenched with   the carnal effluents of desire.No tragic  grandiose flinging of the BellSouth fiber=optic  wiring over the rafter beam since there  wasn't one, positioning the SemperFidic    ergonomic office chair, looping the Jimmy  Hendrix original hand made collectable silk necktie neck, kicking the spinning chair  across the anti static mat cleated like Beckum's soccer shoes to the migraine Millikin  Carpet, kicking the climate controlled air   with its direction adjustable hypoallergenic  louvers, kicking the generic afterlife.There was always Valium.Stumbling to the kidney shaped translucent sea iceberg green designer desk, the  bottles came into his iron hands like magnets snapping onto iron.Valium, Zoloft,  Previcid, Lescal, Seconal, Zantac, Paxil, Ultram...Dewars.Before he knew it, the stock  ticker of his life would be passing before    his eyes.then sweet oblivion.Glorious  nothingness.No more tortuous silicone visions, no more danger sharp curves ahead, no  more Bruce Lucent and his infernal reeking testosterone making a man want to be things  no decent man ought to want to be and do things no decent man ought to want to do, no  more onus of law enforcement's fetid breath hot under his collar, no more ratting, no  more backstabbing, no more megalomaniac Machiavellian machinations, no more  Margaret, no more black Fridays, no more blowoff tops, no more crack spreads, no more  drunkards walks, no more high ticking, no mo re LEAPs, no more margin calls, no more market timing, no more mental stop loss, no more momentum indicators, no more  multiple linear regressions, no more opportunity  costs, no more outside reversal months,  no more pessimistic rates of return, no more pivot points, no more probability density  functions, no more quarterly net profit margins, no more relative return standard  deviations, no more resistance lines, no more   shaved candlesticks, no more spikes, no  more splines, no more whiplashes, no more whipsaws, no more upswings, no more  downswings, no more, no more, no more, no more no more no more no more no         No.No!He did not give up that easy!He was a commodity traded on his own futures exchange.He would die before he  sold himself that short.He was almost jigged out there, almost whacked, almost melted  his own account.But Richard Isaacs was not done yet.Richard Isaccs did not go down  that easy.Richard Isaacs was a market maker.Richard Isaacs was printing on the O!He slung the handful of pills in an overhand arc toward the direction of the  designer wastebasket, watching them soar  through the luminous light of the Ptolemies  World Classic omnidirectional task light, heard them scatter like shotgun shot into the  lacquered executive wastebasket with the little bar graphs decorated on it, the pinnacle of  all his superficial aspirations, the symbol for his nearly untimely fall.Richard Isaacs returned to the window   again.Dick Isaacs looked through his  reflection.No one looked back.No one ever did.Outside the cruel uncaring metropolis.The juggernaut he would bring to it's  knees.Inside Richard Isaacs.
