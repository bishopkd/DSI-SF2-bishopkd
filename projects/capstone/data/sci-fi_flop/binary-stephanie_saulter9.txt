His smile was munificent now, as though she had just won a prize.Indeed I do.Its something, he said with elaborate casualness, that my wife and I have discussed.She sat back in her chair and repressed the urge to heave a sigh of relief.A straight up mutual interest negotiation, couched in terms as subtle as she could wish.And he had come to her.This was so much better than blackmail.I believe Im beginning to understand you, Councillor.Youre worried that anyconcerns shall we saycould undermine the Herran compensation package?Indeed.And if not the package itself, then certainly Sharons and my ability to take advantage of it.Given our positions we have to be very careful about what we allow ourselves to be associated with.Naturally.Tell me, do you have any thoughts on how to mitigate those concerns?I do.He looked as pleased with himself as any other two bit politician she had ever met.You said the opposite outcome was possible, she prompted.That suggests something that enhances our reputation, instead of diminishing it.Something that enhances your reputation, and improves your balance sheet even further.What would that be?Your commitment to absolute fairness, to ensuring complete parity between gems and norms.The thing is, Ms.Klisthe leaned forward conspiratoriallytheres no question that what Herran is gifting to the gem community in exchange for his assistance to you solves an immediate problem.However in the longer term it has the potential to present us with several more.An accusation of unequal treatment is quite possibleinevitable, the more I think about it.Unequal?Her temper flared as she recalled what access to Herran had cost.Aryel Morningstar and Jeremy Temple negotiated over a million credits in BelNatur human genome expertise!Exclusively for gems!Mikal was nodding sagely.So they did.The credit line is going to run and run until it runs out.It could last well over a decade.Compounding the unexpended value over that time will triple the total from what it would have been if wed just paid Herran what we were prepared to.At least.Plus a share of profits from the products we develop as a result....It is an enormous amount of money!Perhaps over the long term, Mikal murmured.The present value is slightly less enormous.But my concern is who and what that credit line will be paying for.Bespoke reproductive engineeringnot just enough for embryo viability, full on compatibility analysis and design.Available to any gem who applies.How is that unequal?Because its not available to norms.She stared at him in disbelief.He let his dangling leg swing gently and pressed his hands together, steepling the four thumbs and six fingers and pointing them at her for emphasis.Ms.Klist, you made that deal under a certain amount of duress and we all know it.The fact that you made it at all tells me you think the value of Herrans involvement will more than merit that enormous amount of money over that extended period of time.But the deal also means BelNatur needs to maintain its human gemtech expertise in order to hold up your end of the bargain.Now thats a fairly big investment, and I cant believe you wouldnt want to find more ways to leverage it.In the meantime, norms are going to be aware of whats on offer to us, theyre going to be aware that instead of the numbers of gemsor at any rate our peculiaritiesdiminishing over the next few generations, our population is going to grow.The Reversionists will, if youll pardon the pun, completely freak out.And will gain popular support, because people who do not share in an entitlement are more likely to turn against it.Why would norms want to share it?They dont have trouble reproducing, and when they do systems are already in place to help.Yes, but they dont get to have special kids, do they?We will.Theyre not going to appreciate the fact that we get all the help we need to have ever more extraordinary children, and they dont.Havent you noticed how glamorous weve become?People are enchanted by the thought of having a child like Lyriam.Or his lovely friend Gwen.Perhaps not another me, but certainly another Aryel.Theres a boom in childrens stories about living under the sea with gillungs or up in the air with flying people.The popular imagination has already gone there.The fingers jabbed at her.And why shouldnt they be able to realize it?Under the tightest controls, of course, the very highest ethical and welfare standards.And, she said slowly, still not quite able to believe what she was hearing, for a price.Absolutely.Those tight controls and high standards, she mused, will be affirmed by our ongoing association with gems.Which will serve as an endorsement.Precisely.This was too good to credit.Time to be blunt, and see if he would backtrack.Councillor Varsi, you are proposing a way back in to human gemtech.Ms.Klist, you are already doing human gemtech, and if all goes well you are going to be doing it for a long time to come.I want to ensure that everything you engage in is aboveboard, and that it doesnt backfire on gems.You want to make money.Im suggesting a way to accomplish both our goals, and Im suggesting you announce it at the close of the Festival.It would be proof of the new ethos of partnership and equality between gems and norms, it would put an end to any lingering doubts about BelNatur.Not to mention being an elegant bookend to your earlier performance.She sat in stunned silence for well over a minute.Out of curiosity, she managed finally, do your associates in the gem community share this view?Some will, some wont.The view that matters most to me is my wifes.Your wife ison board?Completely.The black tower reared above him like a missile, its blunt, bullet shaped tip threatening a sky now heavy with storm clouds.Not even on their first day here had it seemed so menacing.Eli affected a nonchalance he was far from feeling as he crossed the gleaming lobby, reminding himself to make eye contact and smile as he passed the girl on reception.He recognized two young men from the coding team exiting the elevator as he entered it, and he managed to return their nodded greetings without, he thought, any hint of the knowledge that now pressed down on him like a weight.Alone in the elevator, he leaned against the wall, feeling the weariness that had descended under the apple trees of Maryam House wash over him again.I should be used to this by now, revelation piled on revelation.But there was no preparing for such moments.He checked the time on his tablet.Late afternoon already.A couple of hours at the most, and he could usher Callan and Herran home to the safety of the Squats; hopefully innocent of the days developments, quite possibly never to return.He glanced around, eyed the tiny slits of air vents up in the ceiling panel, and wondered how Nance had been infected in the first place.Another cup of coffee, taken casually from the hand of a trusted colleague years ago, nanites inhaled with the steam?A packet of biowipe tissues left on a desk, perhaps, or a ride alone in the elevator?If they want me, theyve got me.Its not like this is the first chance.The opportunities and possibilities spun out in his memory, increasingly lurid, and he was grateful when the elevator came smoothly to a stop and the doors slid open.Callan met him at the entrance to the lab, tablet in hand and green eyes troubled.Eli read the look and sighed inwardly.He let himself be redirected toward the sound dampened seating area.As soon as the air went dead around them Callan spoke.Ive had a message from Aryel.Looking for Rhys.She still hasnt found him?That was bad.Eli had left her pretending to be less perturbed than she was at the emptiness of the apartment, and her inability to raise Rhys on his earset or tablet.She thought he might have gone to be with Gwen...shes recording today, apparently, hed have had to switch everything off...Hes not with Gwen, or Reginald either.Aryel spoke to the studio, but I could have told her that.I dont know where he is, but I think it has to do with something he and Herran have cooked up.They said it was a secret.Eli stared at him, then twisted around to peer in at the open door of the lab, where another test was being run.Herran was sitting up this time, clutching his own tablet to his chest as he read text off the angled screen that was part of the experiments apparatus.Sevi stepped into view by his side, asked him something, and one of his hands came away to jab at the screen.That was evidently not fast enough, and he tucked the tablet securely into his lap and used two hands, working with astonishing speed.He looked up at Sevi a moment later and they could see his mouth form the word Done as he swung the screen away.She looked startled, glanced at a monitor, and then nodded and smiled and said something to him as she stepped away.Herrans nose was already buried back in his own tablet.Whats he doing?I dont know.Hes been weird for the past hour or so, ever since he got Rhyss message.Hes usually quite placid about the tests, he doesnt mind how complicated they are or how long they take.But this afternoon its becomeurgent, as though something critical is happening somewhere else that he needs to attend to.I almost thought he was going to refuse this last one, but while Sevi was explaining he interrupted her.He never does that.He was doing something while she was talkingyou know what hes like, tapping away no matter what else is going onand then he just said, Okay.Five minutes.Quick quick.And he meant it.They had to scramble.You think hes in communication with Rhys?Yes, but when I asked him he said, Cant tell.Promised.He has to.This is important.So I gather.Eli, whats going on?I messaged Aryel backI wasnt too worried at that pointand this is what she said.He spun his tablet around and swiped it awake.Eli saw a text panel with Aryels comcode, and the words NOT GOOD.Need to find him.Talk to Eli, dont be overheard.He looked back into the younger mans anxious face.Whats happened to Rhys?Callan demanded.Is he in trouble?Is he ill?Hes Eli stopped, squinted suspiciously around at the low, comfortable chairs, the curved wall with its panoramic view to one side and the ceiling with its ambient lighting and other unobtrusive panels and projections, and led the way out of the field and into a cramped corner away from the neurolinguistics lab.Callan followed, his worry palpably growing with every step.What are we doing?Being paranoid, most likely.Eli kept his back to the room and sketched out what he had learned about the case, Rhyss discoveries and their implications for BelNatur as well as for him.Whoevers behind this is ruthless as hell, and Sharon is hot on their heels.All thanks to Rhys.Sharons concerned about what the lawyer might have found out from Nance before he collapsed.Nance never knew about Rhys, but the lawyer was at the police station, he knows his way around the system, he might have picked up a rumor of him there.Not, he said quickly, as Callans eyes widened in alarm, that it would serve any purpose whatsoever for anyone to want to harm Rhys.But its a new development that he doesnt know about, and Aryel doesnt like not knowing where he is, not with all this going on.Neither do I.  And I dont like us being here, either.Shouldnt we be going?We cant.If we suddenly packed up and went home it would prove that we think theres a problem.Sharon says she and Mikal have a plan to get everyone safely out of thisincluding Rhysbut its only going to work if Zavcka believes that no one besides the two of them knows anything.So we have to keep a low profile, leave at the usual time, that kind of thing.Act like nothings wrong.Exactly.Eli, Rhys has uncovered a crime that could sink this company for good, put people in prison for the rest of their lives, and now hes disappeared.Something is very wrong.He hasnt disappeared if Herran knows where he is.But were going to have to get him to tell us, and were going to have to do it in a way that doesnt raise any suspicions.Has Sevi noticed hes acting strangely?Shes no fool, she must have.But shes also really wrapped up in this breakthrough theyve made.I dont get the sense that shes focusing on anything else.Good.Lets use that, then.They made their way back into the lab.Herran looked up from his tablet the moment they entered.Though his scarred face was as expressionless as ever, Eli noticed that he was blinking rapidly.Okay, Herran?Okay.He did not sound it.Callan strolled over to him while Eli went to talk to Sevi.She was sitting in a huddle with two of her team members, voices low but animated as they pored over the datastream outputs on the monitor screens around them.He judged it best not to call her away and squatted down beside all of them instead, speaking softly.Hey, Sevi.Mo, Kwame.All still looking really good, I take it?Thats fantastic.Listen, Callans been telling me hes a bit concerned about Herran, have you noticed anything?They looked at each other.Hes been more communicative than usual, Sevi said, just as quietly.But also morehow would you put it, Kwame?Sort of impatient.The man nodded.I worried whether we were asking him to do too much too fastwere all really excited today, you can telland he keeps saying hes okay.But his reactions do seem a little off.Callan thinks so too.It might just be his way of sharing in the excitement, or maybe he is tired but doesnt feel he can say so for some reason.Its not easy for us to tell either, believe me.Were going to take him out into the lounge for a few minutes, give him a change of scene and have a quiet chat.All right?Of course.Dr.Walker, hes been an absolute champion, what weve got today The color was high in her cheeks, and her eyes were shining with discovery.Weve unlocked it, Im certain.If Herran wants to take a break for a few days he really shouldnt feel badly about it.Hes given us so much to work with.Ill make sure he understands that.Thank you, Sevi.He stood up, knees creaking.Thank you so very, very much, Sevi.You just gave us a way out.And I even believe you mean it.They tried to lead him toward the far corner, but Herran headed straight for the chairs within the damper field and they had no choice but to follow.The little gem came to a stop in the middle of the field, blinked at the windows and their astonishing view, and then turned aside so it was out of his field of vision.He did his 180 degree whole body swivel, looking from Eli on his left to Callan on his right.Okay here.No bugs.Eli felt his mouth fall open in astonishment, saw the expression mirrored on Callans face.How do you know?Checked.First day.Eli chuckled.Herran, you are a wonder.Thats very good to know, thank you.But listen, theres something else we need to ask you about.Rhys.Yes.Where is he, Herran?He looked from one to the other of them again.He was rocking and blinking and as close to agitated as Eli could imagine him.Said wouldnt tell.Rhys said dont tell Callan, Callan will worry.Promised.Herran, its too late for me not to worry.Im already worried.Worried, Herran repeated, and Eli realized with a jolt that he was talking about himself.Rhys not answer.But said wouldnt tell.He was rocking harder now.His fingers clenched and unclenched around the tablet.I know you promised, Herran, but this is really important, sometimes promises Eli broke off as Callan held up a hand to silence him.No, thats not going to work.We need to solve this on Herrans terms.Herran, it was me Rhys didnt want you to tell, wasnt it?Yes.Did you promise not to tell Eli?No.And Eli didnt promise anything, so he can tell me.Right?Herran blinked at him.Callan walked away, stepped outside the damper field and stood there with his back turned.Eli shook his head sharply and sank down onto one of the low seats.Herran sat opposite him, back straight and eyes wide.Herran.Where is Rhys?Down below.Below where?Here.He realized Herrans stubby forefinger was pointing between his feet, straight down at the floor.Basement.Minus four.Hes in this building?In building.Minus four.Herran waggled the tablet.Link good.But not answer.Why is he there?How did he get there?Find genetype.I help.He explained in his clipped, disjointed style, until Eli understood it well enough to call Callan back to them.Ive got to go and find him.One of us must.Im not sure it should be you; theyre used to me poking around the building...But the mutinous look on Callans face told him that line of argument would get him nowhere.Okay, fine.How do you get there, though?I thought Id gone to every part of this building, and I had no idea that floor existed.How did Rhys get there?Stairs, Herran responded.He was completely sanguine now that Callan had heard the story from Eli, not from him.Hard to pass.Cams, beams, locks.Okay for Rhys, not okay for you.Take elevator.His fingers flew across the tablet.I make code.Binary        Wings Even her father could not have dreamed of this.Acceleration pushes her back into creamy leather upholstery.Outside the engines rise from whine to bellow to roar, and there is a soft thump beneath her feet as the executive jet leaves the ground.She barely feels it, barely hears it.She has eyes only for the image that rotates on the screen of her tablet.It is an anatomical rendering only, but it is enough.She squints at the complex articulation of the shoulders, the angled planes of bone where powerful muscles connect and contract.The musculature itself is amazing, interweaving and overlapping across the back, the neck, the chest.The schematic flexes, showing how the systems are isolated, each pair of limbs acting independently of the others.She admits now that she had given little credence to the claims Jonah extracted.There are no six limbed vertebrates.There is no template, no genetic framework on which to hang such a creature, no model outside of myth.The building blocks do not exist.She had expected at best a malformed, monstrous thing.But this thing is perfect.They were right to keep it a secret, she thinks, and wonders if she is going soft.Patience has never been her virtue, and they made her wait.But it would have been too easy for word to filter out via assistants and iostreams.Even now details are sketchy; the file was sent only after Jonah had assured Panborn they were on their way, and the illustration is not a photograph.But they will be there soon enough, and there will be no further need of proof.She glances at him, sitting opposite her across the polished bioplastic of the table, staring at his own tablet as though thunderstruck.He feels the gaze and looks up.She raises an eyebrow, a small indicator of her own amazement.He shrugs massively, hands spread, as if to say: Who could ever have imagined?Indeed.Six limbs.A pair of arms, a pair of legs, and a pair of wings.It is almost enough to rekindle her sense of wonder.Binary       28 It was, Rhys thought, like that ancient story of a ship inexplicably abandoned, with sign of neither struggle nor madness; everything left just so, as though the inhabitants might return at any moment.To be sure, some rooms had the cold hollowness of spaces no longer needed and long ago emptied out, but most were well stocked, tidy, and scrupulously clean.There was a succession of laboratories, each with a purpose he recognized.Here was where the modeling would have been done, the virtual selection of sequences, the datastream shuffle and splice preparatory to the manipulation of actual molecules.The researchers had only to step across the hall to deliver their projections to colleagues in charge of doing that molecular excision and reassembly for real; he moved down the banks of equipment, checking off sequencers and centrifuges, thermocyclers and spectrophotometers.At the back of the room he found the cold storage necessary for genestock, checked the labels on a few of the tiny vials, and nodded to himself in satisfaction.In the next room along, the wet work: microscopes and microsurgical equipment for the incorporation of engineered genomes into living gametes, incubation trays for nurturing newly created embryos, more tissue storage.Ova only, he noticed, all identically labeled.A single donor?He moved on, stuck his head inside a bright white room.The examination table with its stirrups and restraints, the neatly racked specula and ranks of syringes, told the next chapter in the story.Implantation, involuntary.He shuddered and ducked out, still chasing the elusive scent.He found a kitchen with fresh milk in the fridge, half a loaf of bread, fruit in a bowl on the countertop.Next to that, and strangest of all: a room full of gaily colored mats and cushions, soft toys and bright bioplastic construction blocks.A rugged, rudimentary tablet, loaded with picture books and nursery rhymes, left on a low table next to a bed.Its coverlet was starred with orange petalled daisies, between which full throated bluebirds appeared to twitter a silent song.Is this a crche?But there was only the one bed, and although narrow it was sized for an adult, not a child.Wheres the dorm?There must be space for surrogates, and a birthing room, and a nursery.They wouldnt need a crche for toddlers yet, surely, the stock wasnt stolen long enough ago.Maybe not the nursery either.But if theyre doing the implantations here theyd need the rest of it.You wouldnt risk bringing them in just to smuggle them right back out again.He stood in the corridor and turned in a slow circle, testing the air, straining his senses to the limit.Still no hint of another human moving anywhere nearby, but he thought he caught a sound this time; something so faint he could not be entirely sure he wasnt imagining it, a hissing pulse on the edge of even his hearing.A few steps in that direction and both the sound and scent seemed stronger.He headed along the passage, calculating as he went.How many people would it take to staff this operation, when it was at full flow?Depends on how many surrogates, but you wouldnt need more than a handful to do the science.Four maybe?Six?Where are they?What the hell is that sound?It led him to a side passage that ran back toward the elevators, and the door of a room that he was certain, the moment he rested his hand against the touchpanel, held a living person.There were low, slow breaths beneath that pulsing hiss, and a hint of human warmth and musk mingled with the unpleasant clinical smell.Beyond that he could read nothing, but he knew what the sound and the smell were now.He pressed the panel, and the door slid back.The room he stepped into could have been in the hospital where he had awoken just the day before; but a critical care suite, not the homely facility for ambulatory patients in which he had stayed.A vital signs monitor and life support unit throbbed against the wall in the barely audible rhythm that had led him here.Tubes disappeared under the blankets of an articulated bed in the center of the room, delivering hydration and nutrition, and drugs too, no doubt, and collecting waste.Though sealed and sterile, the aroma of illness still hung over the equipment; a whiff of intimacies exposed, of incapacity and despair.On the bed was a girl.He moved silently to stand beside her, and felt the breath go out of him.She was young; certainly no older than himself, he thought, though it was hard to be sure.Her face had been burned, badly but not recently.The melted flesh had long since fused, set, and gone pale.The scarring ran down the side of her neck, spread across the patch of shoulder he could see, and disappeared beneath the light blanket that covered her body.Her undamaged skin was the same warm brown as his own; the fuzz of hair covering her scalp glowed the same ruby red.He knew, with a sick certainty that turned his stomach over and made his head swim, that if she were to open her eyes they would be the same midnight blue.Though her breathing was regular and deep, there was something in the girls stillness that told him this would not happen, that her tranquility was not that of normal sleep.Sensor pads dotted her skull and chest, and a slim clip on her nose held the faintly hissing oxygen supply in place.But these were not what shocked him most.It was the swelling low down on her torso, pushing the blanket up into a round flannel hill that he suddenly wanted to touch, to rest his hands against as though giving or receiving a blessing: the unmistakable bulge of a woman in the late stages of pregnancy.There was a pair of chattering office girls in the elevator, who fell silent but smiled politely when Callan entered it.He smiled back, and pressed the button for the cafeteria: the only floor, apart from the lobby and exit, that he had legitimate reason to visit.He could feel them eyeing him up, bursting with the giggles and gossip that he knew would include him the moment they were safely out of earshot.The taller of the two, pale and freckled with elaborately curled ginger tresses, kept having to pull her eyes away from his hair: glowing, flame red, tousled, and in need of a cut.Carelessly sexy, that was what Rhys had called it.Hed come up with the line that first morning, as they lay in bed and he combed through it with his long, clever brown fingers.What makes you think its careless?Capturing the fingers, kissing them, while Rhys laughed.So it was part of your plan, was it, to seduce me with your beautiful hair?Whatever works.Callan felt the breath catch in his throat at the memory, felt his own fingers flex as though caressing silky skin, heard his exhalation turn into something close to a moan.A rush of warmth at his groin.This would not do at all, not now, not here.He shook himself and ran deliberately rough hands back through the mane of hair: clearing it away from his face, clearing the image of Rhys laughing amid a tangle of sheets, clearing his head.Across the elevator the girls exchanged glances.They got off two floors above the cafeteria, much to his relief.If they had still been there when the doors opened he would have had to disembark, pretend he had actually come for something, wait for another elevator, and try again.As it was, the moment the doors closed on their whispers and backward glances he stepped up to the control panel and rapidly pressed floor numbers in the sequence that Herran had instructed and he had memorized.The elevator descended, not stopping at any floors though all the buttons were now lit.It shot past the cafeteria, where Bruce Dunmore waited.He was idly watching the numbers on the inset panels count down and up, the better to plant himself before the sliding doors most likely to open for him, and he was alerted as a down count flicked past that floor without pausing.He glanced at the waiting passengers, wondering if anyone else had noticed.If they had they made no sign.The doors of another car slid open almost immediately, and they piled into it without complaint.His own arrived and he stepped inside, thoughtful.He was the only one in it and he glanced up at the ceiling, toward the executive suite to which he had been summoned, and considered changing direction.There were only two elevators that ran the full length of the building, from top floor to lowest basement, and this just happened to be the other one.He could short circuit the cryptic message that would no doubt be waiting for him, redirecting him to meet her below stairs instead, and just go directly there.But Zavcka Klist had told him to come to her office, and she disliked presumption.Best to stick to the script, collect the message, retrace his steps.He let go of the tiny key he had been fingering in his pocket, the one that would override the other controls and send the elevator straight down to the hidden floor.Follow orders, put up with Herselfs idiosyncrasies, collect the reward.The reward in this case would be well worth it.He relaxed, as much as he ever did, and kept going up.As soon as he went past the second basement level, housing the less than executive parking lot and bowels of building services, every light on the panel went dead.For a moment Callan thought it had all gone wrong, and waited for the elevator to shudder to a halt between floors, and demands for identity and explanation to crackle through its inbuilt comlink.But it kept going, smooth and swift, and he barely noticed that the ride had ended before the doors slid silently back.He stepped cautiously out of the elevator, and into a dimly lit space.It brightened in response to his movement and he saw a small lobby, undecorated and desolate.Corridors branched away from him, all empty as far as he could see, all silent as far as he could hear.He dared not call out.Herran had had no idea where else Rhys might have gone down here, but he had known roughly where the tablet was located.Callan spotted a door that looked about right, only a few steps away.He edged toward it, had his hand on the touchpanel ready to slide it back, when another right hand came down on top of his.Immensely strong fingers wrapped around his mouth from the left, clamping it shut.Rhyss voice hissed in his ear.Cal, what are you doing here?He could neither answer, nor even move.The slim body that had him pinned against the wall, that had been pliant and warm in his arms the night before, might have been made out of steel.Rhys whispered, Shh, no noise.The fingers on his hand and mouth relaxed and that unyielding body stepped back, releasing him.Callan turned around.Im looking for you.He could barely speak for the hammering of his heart.Shit, Rhys!Sorry.Did I scare you?Oh honey, Im sorry.He looked mortified, but the tension was still in him, his eyes flickering from side to side, along the corridors, across to the elevators, back to Callans face.I didnt want to risk you shouting, I wasnt certain yet if you were on your own...but you are, arent you?How did you get here?Why are you looking for me?Because you need to get out of here.This genestock business is blowing up, Rhys.Herrans got what you need, hes got the datastream and he got me down here, but we need to go.Grab your tablet, come on.He stabbed at the call button.It lit up, and stayed lit, and his heart sank.The doors did not open.The elevator was gone.Rhys had not moved.We cant.What do you mean we cant?You got what you came for.These people are killers, Rhys.If they find us How do you even know all this?I didnt want you involved!Herran promised he wouldnt tell you I was here, and I didnt even tell him everything...He didnt.Its complicated.Ill explain on the way.Theres someone here.We cant leave her.Callan spun around and stared at him.What?Rhys held out a hand.Theres only us and her down here, and I dont think she can hear us.But we cant leave her.Come on.Ill show you.The fingers that wrapped around his and tugged him along were gentle again, though he could feel the suppressed power in them now, like a surging river, dammed but barely held back.And more: There was a tremor in the hand he was holding, faint but constant, a distant earthquake deep inside the muscle.Callan swallowed.RhysRhys, sweetheart.Youre not very well, are you?Im fine.Callan could hear the lie in his voice.Im a hell of a lot better than she is.It was a bit late in the day, Zavcka Klist thought with annoyance, for Dunmore to get the fidgets.The stolid security chief had actually looked surprised when Khan showed him into the office, and as she gave him a brusque synopsis of her conversation with Mikal Varsi, his unease appeared only to grow.I take it, maam, he said when she paused for breath, that youre not in any doubt about this proposal?Are you joking, Dunmore?I have huge doubts about it.Norms wanting to have gem babiesthe whole notion is farcical.ButIm sorry, I got the impression you believed him.The fact that the idea is idiotic doesnt mean he doesnt believe it.Hes looking for a way in.Or pretending to.Or pretending to.But why would he?Why tip us off to how much they know if he and the wife arent trying to work an angle for themselves?Dunmore shot another glance at the door, as though he had somewhere better to be, before he looked back at her.Ive met a lot of cops in my time, maam.You can usually tell the ones that are inclined to bend.That wasnt your impression of Sharon Varsi?No, it wasnt.Maybe he talked her into it.The problems got to be with him, after all...if they really have a problem...or maybe...She trailed off, frowning.Maybe he just wanted you to think you can trust them.What would that get him?It might get you to make a mistake.To feel more secure than the situation warrants.Youre the one who said there was no immediate danger...what is the matter with you, Dunmore?as he appeared almost to edge toward the door.To her amazement, he responded with a question of his own.Maam, have you instructed any of the below stairs staff members to return?In light of your conversation with Mikal Varsi, maybe?No, of course not.I did think you were right and we neednt have moved quite so quickly, but no point slowing things down now.Why?He explained about the elevator.I thought perhaps youd gone down yourself, to check on the surrogate.Its probably nothing...an override from maintenance, bringing it down for servicing...Isnt that one of your people?Yes, maam, he is.And he hasnt messaged me the way he should if he was taking it out of service.He tapped at his earset for emphasis.Its probably just a glitch in the building control systems, nothing to do with any of this.There was another one half an hour or so ago, it partially activated the fire safety lockdown on the service floor for a few minutes.Maybe its related, but...But you had better go and check, Dunmore.Now.A couple of miles away Aryel Morningstar once again climbed the stairs that led to the roof of Maryam House, speaking low and fast into her earset as she went.Events were moving swiftly now, with more in play than even she had anticipated, and though much remained uncertain, the risks to Rhys were clear.By now they might be clear even to him, and she quickened her step as she issued final instructions.Once again the stakes were higher than she had imagined, but at least this time she had learned that early.At least this time there was something she could do about it.And this time, my weapons are not so crude She slowed for a heartbeat as she passed beneath the apple trees.There, the stool where she had waited for Eli; waited to confess, be judged, and found wanting.Here, the spot he had stood and then sat to listen, to witness but not to blame; and in that gentle absolution, opened up a world.The past was indeed another country, full of peril and doubt; and she had been moving so fast for so long she had failed to notice how far she had left it behind.Now she strode for the lip of the roof, fingers reaching down automatically to check that her tablet was secure in its squeeze pocket on her thigh.The memory came to her of Zavcka Klist, high in her tower, boasting about how such physical interactions could become obsolete.Think it on, think it off.Work on the fly.Maybe that too.But thats not all, is it, Zavcka?I know what you want now.I know almost all of it I wonder what I would have done, had I been you.Would I have been tempted?The thought made her pause for a moment, just a moment, one foot up on the coping, wings rising to catch the wind.Such a prize, a thing sought and yearned for, a thing killed and conquered for.A gift beyond price.She looked down the long drop between buildings to the ground below, a narrowing, darkening tunnel with death at the end, and considered the question.Her story is not mine.I know what I am.My gift is enough And leapt.Binary        Epiphany She stands on the lip of the gorge that bars her way and finally knows despair.The torrent of water that carved it plunges down, down, down, pulling her gaze with it and her body off balance.She totters, exhausted and awkward, and almost loses her footing on the mist slicked turf.Instinct flings her arms and her other limbs wide, a frantic flapping to haul herself upright, and the torn, soot blackened blanket is flung free to twist and billow lazily into the white churn.She is exposed now as well as trapped, but there is little logic anymore in concealment.The pursuit is too close for another path or another plan.In her minds eye she sees what is behind her, and with eyes the color of sky she looks at what is before, and the choice seems less an outcome than a method.It comes to her then, whispering on a wind through the trees: a sigh softer than the grass beneath her trembling feet, louder than the roar of the water.It is seductive and majestic and insistent, and it catches her and holds her fast.There are shouts in the forest now, and the distant scream of a helicopter wheeling to the hunt, but she no longer hears them.She is listening too hard to something else, something below and above and beyond these distractions.It is barely a pattern but almost a melody, and it murmurs a truth that she feels in the roots of her soul.She is not instructed so much as reminded, revealed to herself.The song that is not a song pounds through her veins now, like fire and ice and the wind between stars, and in this newest of creatures under the sun there blooms a knowledge older than time.There is chaos in it, and order, purpose, and madness, and a pulsing certainty.The song that is not a song sings to her the language of flight.I understand, she whispers, and leans forward, and falls free.Binary       29 Callan stood at the foot of the bed, his shock at the sight of the pregnant, unconscious girl overcome for the moment by a greater worry as he watched Rhys fussing around her, checking monitors and intravenous supplies, mumbling almost inaudibly to himself about fetal heart rates and blood oxygen levels.It seemed the barely discernible tremor of just a few minutes before was becoming rapidly worse, fueling his restless, nervous, constant movement.We need to get back to the others, he tried again.Eli and Herran are upstairs waiting for news, Aryels desperate to know that youre all right...once we get out of here we can send paramedics and police to take care of her...Cant leave, Rhys muttered.Look at her, look at her, look what they did to her, and then they just left her here.Shes all alone, Cal, look.Look at what they did.I see, sweetheart, I see her.I see what they did.We need to send people who can take care of her properly, who can make sure shes safe.Ill keep her safe.Shes all alone, look, they left her, they left her all alone.We cant leave her alone.Were not going to abandon her, of course were not.But shes stable, Rhys, you said so yourself.Whatevers wrong with her, shes not getting any worse lying there.But you are, sweetie, youre falling ill.You know you are.We need to get you out of here.What if they come back?They might come back.They might hurt her.Oror take her away.Rhys, please, I know your head isnt feeling too clear right now, but try and think.Think it through with me.Callan drew a deep breath, thinking it through himself, trying to express it in a way that Rhyss fracturing intellect could grasp.Whoever left her here went to a lot of trouble to set up the life support so her condition wouldnt deteriorate while they were gone.They wouldnt have done all that if they were going to come back and do her harm.Rhys had stopped beside the bed, bending forward a little with his hands held in a painful pose up against his chest, fists spasmodically clenching and unclenching.Though he was staring fixedly at the girl, his head was tipped toward Callan.There was a frown of intense concentration on his face, and for the first time since he had heard his lovers voice out by the elevators, Callan felt a tiny surge of relief.He was listening, and Callan realized that he was trying, trying hard to focus and to think.She cant walk, he went on, keeping his voice low and even.Stay with me, Rhys.Theyd need a medical transport to move her.That means transferring the life support to a mobile unit, and that takes time.Theres no way anyone could get her out of here in this condition faster than we can get out and get help.He had an idea, palmed his tablet, and aimed it at the still figure on the bed.Sharons not going to need to wait for a warrant once she knows theres a comatose gem surrogate locked away in the basement.Shell be down here with an ambulance crew and half the police force in ten minutes flat.And the moment we get to where theres a signal, I can send her proof.He waved the tablet at Rhys.But we need a signal.I cant get onstream from here.I can.He came toward Callan, his gait strange and shuffling, hands extended for the tablet.Ill get you onstream.What?How?Relays, Rhys said.He spoke quietly, and appeared to be trying to mimic Callans calm, methodical tone; but with a great deal more effort.Same way mine is talking to Herran.Need to give yours access.With the clearer speech had come a sharp drop in coordination, and he practically clawed the tablet out of Callans grasp.Call from here.Wont have to leave her.He stabbed at it awkwardly.Rhys.I can hold it together, he whispered, but Callan could hear the strain in his voice, and this close he could see the tics and tremors that chased themselves across his face and hands, like insects swarming just beneath the surface of the skin.When the elevator deposited Dunmore in the drab little lobby of sub basement four, his first thought was that nothing whatever seemed amiss.The lights were reassuringly dim until he stepped into their radius, and the place was silent as a tomb.He sighed, and relaxed his grip on the hard, comforting handle of the gun.Check the surrogate first, then the rest of the floor; report to Herself, and go lean on his plant in maintenance to find an explanation.These glitches, if thats what they were, could not be allowed to happen again.The cocky bastard had already had the nerve to suggest he might have imagined the ghost passage of the elevator.Dunmore had given him an earful for that, but in truth he was beginning to wonder himself.He was already half a stride past the server closet when he noticed something, a wrongness that tugged at the edge of his vision and brought him back around.There was a gap between the edge of the door and the jamb, a line of darkness no wider than the thickness of his palm; as though the release had been pressed and then pressed again quickly, before the door could slide completely open.Or closed.Could it have been left like that earlier, in the rush to evacuate, to get to the new premises and prepare them for the nighttime transfer of surrogate, supplies, and equipment?But none of the staff members on duty this morning were responsible for the labs datastream, they would have had no business in there.He pressed the release himself, and the door slid back.The lights came on.What they illuminated this time brought him up short.A tablet sat next to the server, its bright yellow memtab connector flashing slowly; and the gun was tight in his hand again, as a cold, still alertness descended.No glitch, this.And was that a murmur of sound now, deeper in the bowels of the building?He listened, but if it had been there it was gone.He moved over to the tablet, and swiped the blank screen awake.A complex, shifting design filled it, a morphing web of colors and shapes.Whoever had gotten in here was using a pattern password, and he was taken aback for a moment.Those were generally the province of data geeks, not cops or corporate rivals.He would have to scrawl a sigil across it, connecting points within the slip sliding hues and geometries in just the right order and at just the right instant to gain access.Impossible.He scribbled a finger experimentally over the screen.It flared bright white for a microsecond, washing out the wriggling pattern; then it came back up again, now even more complicated, and moving faster than before.Dunmore did not try again.Instead he hooked his fingers under the connector, and tugged.It came away, and he slid the tablet inside his jacket.It would take time to destroy it properly, and Herself might want to have someone take a look before he did so.No telling what else might be on there.He stuck his head out of the door, listening.Now he was sure he heard something.Voices, more than one; maybe many more, but waiting would not improve the odds.He held the gun in both hands like an old friend and went to find them.Two hundred feet above his head, Eli sat with Herran in the dead zone of the lounge, pretending to work on his own tablet while the little gem rocked and tapped and swiped.Sevi and the others had been perfectly accepting of his explanation that Herran was in fact a little stressed and in need of a longer break and some refreshment, which Callan had gone to fetch.But as the minutes ticked by without his return, Eli began to wonder how long it would take before one of them came out to ask if he had gotten lost on the way to the cafeteria; or worse yet, put a call in upstairs to report the absence.He was trying to work out a way to forestall this when a touch on the arm made him jump almost out of his skin.Herran, who never ever touched anyone except for the brief, ritualized handclasp at greeting, had reached out and poked him.Eli.The pale gray eyes were enormous.Server link gone.Broke.The link from Rhyss tablet?Its gone down?Gone down.Thats good, right?He must have collected it, they must be on their way up.But there was something in Herrans demeanor, the agitated rock nodding and staring eyes, that told him this was not the news he hoped for.Not Rhys.Not disconnected.Broke.Wrong password, then broke.Eli felt his mouth go dry.Okay, Herran.This is what we need to do.Higher still in the tower, Zavcka Klist swiveled into yet another sharp turn before the glass sculpture on her office wall, and stopped abruptly.This was ridiculous.She was wearing a hole in the carpet, not to mention her shoes.Dunmore had messaged from maintenance with the news that all looked to be in order; there was no record of an elevator being taken to the lower floor since he himself had done so to slip the staff offsite during the lunchtime crush.He was going down to double check, and would report back.She was seized by a sudden unease at the thought of him, alone down there with the girl.What if he tripped over a tube, or touched the life support settings?What if he touched her?How much did she really know about Dunmore anyway, save that nothing appeared to be beyond or beneath him?And even if the surrogate was perfectly safe as far as he was concerned, was it really a good idea to have left her, unconscious and alone, hooked up to a machine that had no way of alerting anyone if something went wrong?Khan jumped in surprise as she came through the door at top speed, blowing past him without a sideways glance; then recovered and was on his feet, hurrying after her.Ms.Klist?Stay here, Khan, I dont need you.Youve that conference in Cancel the conference.She strode past the startled receptionist without a look or a word.I need to check on something below stairs.I might be a while.She stepped into the elevator.Khan could see a tiny metal key in her hand.He stopped, staring, as she stabbed the button for the basement level as though it were an enemy.Her eyes were like black stones in a face gone hard as marble.The doors slid closed and she was gone.Rhys looked close to tears when Callan finally took the tablet gently away from him and slipped it back into his pocket.Thats it, thats enough.Youve done all you can.Its okay.Rhyss head was down and he was shaking it as though in defeat.His whole body was shaking, hands tight up against his chest again, and his breathing came in short, sharp gasps of pain.Callan went to wrap an arm around him, and felt him flinch.Shes going to be all right, we just need to And then Rhys was rearing back in alarm, away from Callan and the door, a look of horror and profound shock on his face, and Callan, startled, recoiled as well.Into a small hard roundness, pressed into the small of his back.This time the voice was one he did not know.Dont move.Put your hands on your head.If you make a sound I will shoot you.And over his shoulder, to Rhys, You too.Hands on your head.Who else is here?How many?Zavcka Klist enjoyed no moment of false confidence as she stepped out of the elevator.Though she could not make out the words, there was no mistaking Dunmores voice.The shouting was coming from the direction of the medical unit.And now a second voice shouting back, one that she thought she recognized.She had an inkling, then, of how her security might have been breached; and cursed herself for a fool as she ran.He cant!Callan yelled.Dunmore had shoved him further into the room, staying close to the door and covering them both with the gun.It was a blunt, ugly, deadly thing, and he felt his guts quail at the sight of it.Right now it was pointed at Rhys, who stood swaying, ash gray and drenched with sweat, his hands still curled into fists and pressed up against his collarbone.Callans own hands were clamped on top of his head as ordered, but Rhys seemed unable to comply.He cant, Callan said again, trying to inject some calm into his voice, into the situation, even as the room seemed to spin slowly around him.There was a hiss followed by a hollowness in his ears.He wondered if he was about to pass out.You had better fucking not.Hes ill, cant you see?Hes...finding her, finding her like this, its sent him into shock...hes no threat to you.Hes no threat!And he found himself stepping in front of Rhys as the gun was raised and steadied.If he cant talk hes no fucking use to me, but you might be.Get out of the way.Callan looked at the big man, heard the death in his voice, saw it in the small black cavity of the barrel and knew he was in a place he had been before.It washed over him for a moment: the certainty of his own destruction, the memory of pain and terror and utter helplessness, the roaring, screaming horror of it.He felt Rhyss warmth at his back and heard himself say, No.And as Dunmore stared at him in amazement, heard something elseheels clicking along the corridor outside, moving fast, coming closer.Dunmore swung around, gun coming to rest on the doorway as Zavcka Klist appeared in it.Callan, his muscles tensing to try something, anything, froze as though paralyzed.It was partly the look on her face that stopped him, ice hard and implacable, and the black fury in her eyes.They widened in surprise for the merest instant at the sight of Rhys, and then she was all arrogant, aristocratic command.Dunmore, do not point that thing at me.Point it at them.Whats the situation?Found them in here, with her.And a tablet, downloading data from the server.You have that?Yes, maam.Right here.He tapped at the chest of his jacket and she nodded briskly, stepping into the room beside him.Are there others?Dont think so, maam.Theyd have turned up by now if there were.The black gaze fixed on Callan.Is it just the two of you?He considered for a moment whether it would be better to lie, try to convince her that the shadowy recesses of Sub Basement Four were swarming with infiltrators.It was an attractive prospect, but not one that would stand up to much scrutiny.On the other hand if he told her that he and Rhys were alone she would see no reason not to have them shot immediately.Yes, he replied, and added, For now.More are on their way.Theyll be here in a few minutes.I very much doubt that.I assume Herran got you in here somehow, but hes hardly going to be charging to your rescue.He might surprise you.Not again, he wont.Theres no stream access down here.You know that; thats why you were trying to copy the datastream to your tablet.All Herran, or Eli Walker, or anyone else whos in on this adventure of yours will know is that you disappeared.Well cooperate fully with the search, but all anyone will find is a vacant floor that hasnt been used for years.If they pull out, so be it.Weve got what we need from him.He opened his mouth to reply, but she forestalled him by stepping a little to the side to peer around him at Rhys, and the still, silent girl on the bed.Rhys, I take it?I expected something more impressive, after everything weve heard.Whats wrong with him?Why isnt he talking?Hes ill.He has acondition.Not for long.Get away from her!Snapping, as Rhyss swaying shuffle took him a half step closer to the girl.What were you doing in here?If youve hurt her...If weve hurt her?Callan was incredulous.Were not the ones who burned her, or who have her locked up and unconscious, in a dungeon, being used as a surrogate.Its not us whos hurt her, Ms.Klist.Thats on you.She cast a sideways glance at him, looking oddly, bitterly amused.The burns have nothing to do with me.Dunmore shifted deliberately in the doorway and she nodded and stepped back, closer to him, further away from the two captives.Callan saw that in the distraction of her arrival he and Rhys had become separated.Rhys stood across the room now, two long strides away, and his heart sank.How do you want to handle this, maam?You seemed to have matters in hand when I arrived, Dunmore.What were you going to do?The bitter amusement had seeped into her voice as well.I was going to question this one, shoot them both, get rid of the bodies, and then come report to you.I see no reason to change any part of that plan except the last item.Callan, watching Rhys and thinking hard, imagined that he saw the younger mans hands flex for a moment before the import of her instruction dragged him back.You wont have time, he said, keeping his voice deliberately light.Maybe it would give them pause, make them wonder.The others are too close.You dont have time to kill us and dispose of our bodies before they get here.So you need to consider whether thats the kind of evidence you want to be found with.Zavcka shook her head.Nice try, but you havent been down here long enough for anyone to And then Rhys moved.Although Callan was looking at him as it began, looking with the intensity of a man who wishes his last sight to be of the thing he cares for most, he could not afterward say exactly how it started, or what he did, or in what order.One instant he was standing there, arms just starting to come down to his sides, head just starting to come up; then there was no more than a blurred streak of skin and clothing with a smeared ruby shimmer at the top.Dunmore gave a strangled shout as he was borne over backward.Then came a series of images, strobe flashes on his consciousness: Dunmores arm yanked straight, the hand with the gun still in it pointing up at the ceiling, and another, crushing hand wrapped around the wrist.The report of the weapon, shockingly loud within the enclosed space, and the thud and skitter as it fell and skated away somewhere.Rhys on top of Dunmore, the dead mans hand with its shattered wrist flopping away, Rhyss other fist slammed into a throat gone strangely flat.Dunmores eyes popped halfway out of their sockets, his mouth open in a half finished scream.Callan had barely begun to take his own hands down from his head before it was all over.Rhys slumped back against the wall, staring at his hands as though in disbelief, face stunned and racked with pain.For a moment his eyes met Callans.Cal, he said.I didnt mean The spasm took him, arching his body from the soles of his feet to the crown of his head, twisting him away from the wall to fall hard to the floor.Callan was by him in an instant, trying to grab the flailing limbs and hold them still, then simply to cradle and protect Rhyss head as it beat out a tattoo on the cement.He felt the skin on his own knuckles crack and break.It could have been no more than a few seconds, but it felt as if hours had ticked by before the convulsions subsided enough for him to bring his own weight to bear and hold Rhys down.It still felt like he could be thrown off at any moment.A metallic clink against the hard floor, and the sinking cold in his belly again.He twisted his head around.Zavcka Klist was straightening up, the gun in her hand.He could see the shock on her face transmuting into fury and a hard, merciless hatred.If anyones planning to show up, he said aloud, now would be a fucking good time.Binary       30 Even in the swirling chaos of the moment, Zavcka Klist thought it was a strange kind of humor that would make a young man struggling to contain a foaming, thrashing lunatic, who had just witnessed one death and was seconds away from his own, speak sarcastically to the ether as though spirits might step out of it and come to his aid.She thought that an instant before she was hit from behind, the impact sending her staggering forward, the gun ripped from her hand.She caught herself against the edge of the hospital bed and spun around.The girl, the one from the concert, the beautiful girl with polished brown skin and curling, glowing, dark red hair, and dark blue eyes sparking a fury to match her own.Droplets spinning off the hem of a raincoat as she moved, almost too fast for the eye to follow.The gun shredding in her hands, not just pulling the magazine out, breaking it out, the trigger spinning merrily away through the air under the snapping force of her fingers.The mangled weapon was tossed into the furthest corner and the ammunition tucked safely into a pocket as she moved with the same blurring speed to where her brother lay beneath Callan on the floor.Behind her, wings filled the doorway.Aryel Morningstar stepped over Dunmores body, and into the room.She took in the scene in an instant, periwinkle bright eyes scanning every inch in a way Zavcka knew would miss nothing.Her dark hair was also damp, and beads of water dotted the surface of her wings.Move away from the bed, Ms.Klist.Over against that wall, please.Now.And Zavcka felt herself obey, too stunned to argue, because hanging back in the corridor, retching at the sight of Dunmores lolling tongue and displaced eyeballs, was Arthur Khan.The only words she could find were for him.You bastard.On the contrary, Mr.Khan is here precisely because he is not a bastard.And we would have gotten in without his help anyway, but he did save us time.Aryel crossed to the bed, but her attention was on the trio on the floor.Gwen?Gwen was lying half on top of Rhys, helping Callan to hold him, her greater strength containing the worst of his convulsions.She held his jerking head under the crook of her jaw and was muttering to him, baby talk it sounded like, soothing, pleading.His eyelids fluttered over eyes rolled up so that only the whites showed.He needs help, Ari, he needs a sedative...something...its not...stopping...She has medicine, Khan said hoarsely.Pills in...in her pocket.She gets fits sometimes...she didnt think I noticed...but not so bad as him, not nearly so bad...I dont know if it would help.Thank you, Arthur, I think it might help a great deal.Zavcka, your pills, please.Piss off.Aryel frowned and Gwen looked up, but it was Callan who was on his feet and slamming her back into the wall with his left hand, his right feeling along her jacket.He found a pocket, dipped into it, came out with a little bioplastic tube half the length of his finger.This?Khan swallowed.Yes.Callan let go and turned back to Rhys without another look or word.Gwen had rolled him around and was sitting braced against the opposite wall, holding him from behind.Her arms were wrapped tight around his, hands gripping her own wrists to hold them in place as he twitched and spasmed, with her legs crossed over his thighs.That was less effective, and Callan had to rest his own weight on Rhyss shins as he knelt, to keep him from kicking himself free.He grabbed Rhyss chin with one hand and popped the tube open with the other.How many?At least two, I imagine.Zavcka, how many do you take for an attack?She stayed furiously silent and Aryel rounded on her, wings arched and eyes blazing.Her voice was like the crack of a whip.Zavcka!Do you think watching him suffer instead of helping is going to help you?HOW MANY?For the first time, Zavcka Klist flinched.One if its just coming on, two if I dont catch it in time.They said I could take up to three if it got really bad.Callan, give him four.He looked up, startled.You sure?Hes heavier than she is, and this is worse than bad.He nodded, and then they had to watch while he tried to wrestle Rhyss clenched jaw open.Squeeze, Gwen said.Hard.Harder.
