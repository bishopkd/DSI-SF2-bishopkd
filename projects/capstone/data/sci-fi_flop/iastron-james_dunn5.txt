Circumstance.Meaning?You have me captive for now, yes, but soon my lord will have destroyed your beloved little world.I doubt you and your ...dwindling crew would last much longer.And so you will eventually surrender and free me.Gordian leaned in ever closer, so far as his restraints would allow.And then I will kill you ...captain of Titan.Ferranti shrugged off the threat.Your training has certainly increased since we last met.That much is obvious.But there are more important things going on, Gordian.You must realise the effect your Dishans bidding is going to have across the Four Systems.The disorder thats ensued on Rotavar will only bring opposition to your cause.The smile disappeared from Gordians face.Opposition we can deal with.You we can deal with.Do not begin to think you know anything of my lord.Do you think he would do all this without a definitive way to ensure victory on a wider scale?And how can he do that?The Crilshan sat back and looked directly at him.You know where my loyalties lie.Sitting back himself, Ferranti frowned.You truly believe that if Crilshar destroys Titan and exerts its power over every last man, woman, and child, that humanitys survival will be ensured?Crilshars survival.I mention nothing of humanity.How?Tell me how.You know where my loyalties lie, Gordian repeated.I can say no more.Ferranti sighed, stood.For now.Forty One      Anna woke to silence.Dripping in sweat, she gazed into the blackness of her room, remembering at once where she was.And why she was here.Ghostly images of her dream surrounded her in her bed, and she began to cry.Leave me alone, she pleaded.All she wanted was to close her eyes and not be haunted by her nightmares.But they would not leave her alone.The pale man.Gilaxiad ...Activating the light above her bed Anna looked over to where Glana slept soundly.Im so sorry, she said.My selfishness has caused so much trouble.So much grief.So much ...She sat up, her blanket draped over her, and she wrapped her arms around her legs.Unable to go back to sleep, she sat there until morning.Part of her wanted to continue with what she and Jon had planned; it seemed silly to give up.It would mean his death was for nothing.Maybe she could go on and find a way to Earth alone, and keep Jon alive by accomplishing their dream.But there was Glana to consider.Anna had allowed her to be trapped on the Stellarstream with them.It was only right that she ensured her sister returned safely, was it not?Only, she feared what her uncle would be like if she went back.They had parted on such awful terms, not imagining shed ever see him again, and she was in no hurry to go strolling back into his home, whether or not Captain Ferranti had told him of their brave deeds on Rotavar.Leaving Titan was not her greatest choice; deciding whether or not to go back was.* * *  On the second day of their journey home from Rotavar Anna took to roaming the halls of the mighty vessel.Though she had been warned not to stray from her quarters without an escort, she could not stay confined any more, and so left her sister sleeping.Glana had been complaining of stomach ache, and had slept for most of the day anyway.She almost lost her way in the vast, cold labyrinth; eventually, however, a vivid, blue bursting light could be seen down one of the long corridors.Her curiosity, as always, prevailed.Each hour of the so far silent journey had faded into one another; time lingered unbearably and the mood of everyone she came into contact with offering little welcome.For the crew of the Stellarstream, it seemed, the pain of Rotavar was still very much fresh in their minds.Fortunately she did not run into any of the crew as she moved along the interior walkway and across a narrow bridge.The blue flashes became brighter, more intense, and around the corner she peered through a small window of a metal hatch, discovering at last the source of the glow.Inside she saw a large room, lit with blinding flashes of the bright blue light.High up and overlooking the room were a number of soldiers, clad in gold and black and stood still and exact, watching the clash below, where two masked figures hurled bolts of blue and purple electric forks across the room at each other.In their right hands Anna recognised the source of the energy: the standard coilbolts of a Titanese Guard.Across their other arms were black, rectangular, rubber like shields through which they caught the electric bolts and in turn fired their own.Amazing!she said to herself.An actual coilbolt duel.You ever played?said a voice from behind.Anna spun, angry that she had once again found herself caught, to see a young, dark skinned woman, only a few years older than her.She stood before her, dressed also in form fitting black and gold.Im sorry, Anna said.I know Im not supposed to ...its just ...so ...amazing.The woman smiled.Youre certainly right there, Anna.Anna was not surprised that she knew her name, and so smiled weakly in reply.Quite surprisingly the woman held her hand to her breast in acknowledging salute.Anna wasnt sure how to react, and so settled on a terse nod.Have you ever fought?the woman asked.Only a little.Im not very good.As with most things, she realised.Nor am I, she replied with a girlish grin.Still, theres nothing like the crack and boom of a coilbolt duel to get your blood pumping.Before Anna could reply the hatch behind her opened and Captain Ferranti stood in the doorway, sweating.Anna, he said, as though he had been expecting her.I see youve met Lieutenant Avila.Yes.Good.Shes your minder while youre with us.Minder?I thought it best to keep my distance, Avila said.I watched you down here.To Ferranti she said, Shes quite safe, sir.Good, he answered.Anna, care to accompany me to the viewing bridge?Anna did not need asking twice.Yes ...oh ...yes, definitely.Come on then, he said, wiping his face with a towel and throwing his arm shield to a pursuing Guard.While Lieutenant Avila followed behind, Anna tailed Ferranti through the halls of the vessel in silence, walking a pace or two behind until they came to the viewing centre of the ship.If she remembered her classes at the Institute correctly, large vessels such as the Stellarstream could be operated with very few crewmembers, from the control room at the centre of the ship.The captain would normally remain at the viewing centre, however, and direct the entire company from up there.Ferranti had explained, with a noticeable lack of detail, how the assassin Gordian had butchered many of his crew.Thankfully the majority were not on board when the attack had taken place.And so, resting above the forward section of the Stellarstream, the viewing centre was bustling with diligently focused men and women.Its so beautiful, she said, gazing at the projection screen displaying the endless canvass of black, joined by distant clouds of colours she had never even seen before.I wonder which one is Saturn.Well, the Captain said with a chuckle, none of them are.She turned to him.I dont understand.I thought someone had been to explain it to you, Anna.Nobodys told me anything.I thought ...are we not going home?The Captain guided her down the sloping platform, and beneath the projection wall they sat on a blue padded bench.It was the rooms only secluded spot.Avila stood nearby, keeping herself busy by subtly checking on silent viewing centre crewmembers.Ive spoken with your uncle, Ferranti said.Be it only briefly, as were almost out of communicative range.Why?she asked.Where are we?Were on the outer edge of the Fourth System, he said.Here, among the few Accentauriban planets and moons, our help is needed most.Titan is safe under the Generals command for now.He has been named as Titans Lord, following the deaths of Lady Pinzn and General Mauldeth.Hes also managed to persuade the Council to keep some of our vessels in locations of need.And were in the right place, at the right time.So where are we headed?We will be going home soon.I promise.But first we must deliver supplies by means of an outpost to a Titanese aid vessel working with one of the outer worlds of Enustine.How far away are we?she asked, all of a sudden feeling intensely claustrophobic at the thought of being trapped on the vessel for yet more time.Ferranti rested a hand on her shoulder.Well arrive at our destination tomorrow.An outlying outpost we call Aurora.Anna gazed up at the screen of black space before them.While she was frustrated she had not been told what was happening, the thought that she was headed to the outer edges of manned space, farther than many had ever gone, electrified her way more than most thoughts.Anna, Ferranti then said with a touch of grim importance.Im afraid I have some more news.Something you may find upsetting.What is it, Ferranti?Its Callista, he said.Back on Titan, Gordian ...he got to her.She ...Shes dead?No, shes alive.But only just.Shes in something of a neutral state.The doctors have so far been unable to wake her.Anna scraped her hand through her hair.Shell be okay.I know she will.Ferranti nodded.Shes a strong old Istron.Stronger than me by far.Anna frowned.You know about her?Dont go thinking there are many of us, Anna, he whispered.Besides your uncle, you and I are her only students.Shes my Istron too.I didnt know.She never said.He laughed.Shes good at that.Anna looked down.Callistas never trusted me.She lies to me.Keeps me in the dark.She doesnt believe in me, and shes right.A grouchy old crow she may be, he said.But shes wiser than any who now live.You wouldnt be her student if there wasnt something special she sees in you.Callista trusts you.Trust me.The Captain stood.He straightened his back and pleated training outfit and said, Something important has occurred to me, Anna Berenguer.What?We left Titan the night of your birthday.So?Tonight, the night before we reach Aurora, Im to have a gathering in memory of those we lost on Rotavar.Life and death are worth marking together.Tonight well also celebrate your birthday.Come to my quarters later; Ill send details and dress ware to your room for you and Glana.Be there, he said with another smile, before walking out of the viewing platform and leaving her sat, in the company of Lieutenant Avila, pondering his words as they journeyed into the deepest space.Forty Two      Gordian looked up from the uncomfortable seat in the centre of his cell.His guard preferred not to look at him.Rightly so, he thought.Then again, the lack of attention; the arrogance in thinking this place could contain him; the failure to recognise who one should and should not trust ...The Titanese thought he was trapped.Fools.Even in confinement his masters revealed their presence.The Rotavarian chief had paid a welcome visit before they had left that filthy desert planet, courtesy of whosoever had sent him on his mission in the first place.No words had been spoken, but Gordians freedom was granted.His guard turned around and the assassin stared, unblinking.Then he smiled.It was too easy.The guard frowned, and twisted back.Not long now, he thought.Not long now.* * *  When Anna and Glana Berenguer entered the captains private quarters that night, they were shocked to find a long table already lined with a dozen guests, in addition to an astonishing array of food and drink.All were attended to by a host of well groomed servantsfrom maids to kitchen staff.Everybody watched the sisters as they moved along the table, hoping to find two empty seats.Anna saw their faces, and bowed her head.She knew that many of them were muttering, mouthing words, whispering about how she had slipped aboard the vessel and caused the deaths of their crewmates.Over here!came a voice from the end of the table.Anna looked over and recognised the old gentleman, now considerably less bloody than when she had seen him in the control centre in the face off with Gordian.Over here!he said again, pointing to a couple of empty seats near the head of the table.Ive saved them especially.Thank you, she said.Howre you feeling?Oh, much better.He stood and held two chairs out for them.The captain should be along in a moment.Dont mind this lot, he said, gesturing to the line of officers which, after ignoring the sisters, had begun to talk among themselves once again.Too stuck up their own backsides to acknowledge the fact that you saved their lives.Oh, no, Anna said.We really didnt  Nonsense!Youre both heroes.I wont hear otherwise.Naffans the name.Anna, said Anna.Glana, her sister added.Of course you are!You  He was interrupted by the screeching of chairs as everyone stood to greet Captain Ferranti.Dressed in a silver version of his usual military uniform, he strode from his quarters to the head of the table, and after flashing Anna a brief smile signalled for everybody to sit.He remained standing and an attendant handed him a crystal glass filled with sparkling white wine.Raising it he said to the group, In the name of our mother, Titan, please put your glasses together in remembrance of the brave men and women we lost on Rotavar.Our mission there found success.Rotavar is free.But, as usual, it came at a cost.He raised his glass.To the silent.To the silent, all repeated.Before long food was served, and conversation began between the twenty five guests.Many spoke of numerous topics Anna barely grasped; although she picked up on a few words and phrases being tossed about: words like Crilshar, Enustine, and she definitely heard somebody mention Yux Dishan.Jon often spoke of those things, but she had never really listened.She wished he were there with her.Anna!Ferrantis voice snapped her out of her thoughts.Miss Berenguer?Sorry ...Im sorry, she said, looking up and almost dropping a spoonful of stewed chicken leaf that had gone cold as she daydreamed.What ...What was it?Nothing too important, he said, raising his eyebrows.You sure youre okay?You dont seem to be eating much.Im not too hungry.I dont think either of us is.She turned to Glana, but found that her sister was stuffing herself with mouthful after mouthful.Or maybe just me, she said.Nice to see you with your appetite back, sis.Om, um, nom, came Glanas reply.Anna and Ferranti laughed loudly.The Captain snorted, fortuitously spitting some of his potato into the communal soup bowl in the inner table.Anna attempted to hide her amusement as she watched his eyes widen, scanning the guests to see if any had noticed.To his luck they had not.They caught each others eye and burst out laughing, catching the attention of much of the table.That had done the trick.She began to speak with Ferranti and forgot what had been troubling her.The Captain recounted myriad tales about his travels, and told her all about his visit to Earth.The most extraordinary and beautiful place!he cried, after a few too many glasses of wine, one of his blond curls drooping down in front of his eyes.There are no space vessels in sight!The sky is pure blue in the day and complete black at night!Oh, I do believe that rhymed!Anna sat back, grinning and enjoying herself for the first time in so long she actually felt guilty.Glana was busy chatting to everyone around her, asking questions, and eradicating any sign of a full plate.After the main meal Lieutenant Mica Avila joined the group and sat on the other side of Ferranti, beside old Naffan.It turned out Naffan, a plump, kind gentleman, was the Stellarstreams Central Commander, and responsible for the running of the ships engines.Which is why Gordian had needed him back on Rotavar, she realised.He had plenty of tales to tell himself.For what seemed like hours the four discussed many things and Anna finally felt as though she had found her place, where she was meant to be.With a crew, with people that understood her, doing something amazing and meaningful.Talk soon turned to their current mission.It is not our duty to be out here, one pilot commander reasoned.Of all Alignment bodies, ours is left to fight the fight, then pick up the pieces, and take the blame too!Our duty is whatever were told it is, Avila countered.And you would do well to remember it, Commander Naffan added.Ferranti sat back, nodding to an attendant, who quickly refilled his glass.Anna leaned towards Avila.Why are we going to Aurora?Rotavar was freed, wasnt it?It was, Anna.But Crilshars fleet had already moved on by the time we reached the world.Moved on to Enustine?Exactly.The Enusti Empire is powerful, and could likely fight Crilshars fleet and win.But there are other worlds here in Accentaurib.The Queendom on Samos is not as strong as it thinks it is, and Samos relationship with Enustine has never been healthy.Theres so much discord and conflict, before Crilshar ever came here.On Titan it is clear that Accentaurib cannot fall.The Alignment worlds would not survive if Crilshar gained the Fourth System.So my uncles right.We have to help them in any way we can.Your uncle is a brave man, Anna.Youre very lucky to have him.Nearby, Ferranti giggled to himself.Amusing yourself over there?Avila mocked.You two are amusing me, he said.Less talk of war and Crilshar at my table, please.Enough.Tell me about you, Anna.He rocked on his chair slightly.Ive heard plenty about you.Callista tells me youre fascinated with planet Earth.Humanitys home, said Naffan, joining in.Jolly good!Beautiful place!Yes, Anna said.For as long as I can remember.Callista used to show me pictures and music and read me poetry and stories about its people, hundreds and even thousands of years old.There are very few Earth enthusiasts among the Systems, Lieutenant Avila said, taking a small sip of wine.Indeed!agreed Naffan.Not enough if you ask me.Preferable!Ferranti declared.How so?The Captain offered his glass to Naffan.Drink?Oh, no thank you.Ferranti grinned and winked at Anna.More for me then.Naffan frowned, but Anna understood what he meant.The less people there were to appreciate it, the more remained for those that did.It would not become tainted and overcrowded like everywhere else.Many of the guests eventually began to leave.The sound of chatter died down and Ferranti excused himself, disappearing back into his quarters.A moment later he returned, sat back in his seat, and offered something to Anna.Its from Earth, he told her.They call it an old swiss army knife.Happy birthday!Anna almost couldnt find the words.Ive enjoyed tonight so much, she said.Thank you.Thank you for this.Two thousand years and rumour has it no invention has been more practical than an old swiss knife.He grinned and took the entire wine bottle from the attendant, then stood and disappeared again.She sat back, playing with the old swiss knife, uncovering a small torch, a knife, and a dozen more mechanisms.Avila and Naffan pulled their chairs closer.They all looked at the gift and watched Ferranti reappear, stumble about, and knock over a tall vase and a rack of silverware.How much has he had?Anna asked.About a bottle and a half, I think, Avila replied.Make that four and a half, Naffan corrected.And thats good for him, the lieutenant said.Normally he doesnt drink at all!Anna gasped.Really?Why do you think hes not allowed to attend military functions?Hes not?Have you ever seen him at one?Well  Both Naffan and Avila raised their eyebrows and nodded slowly.Just wait, she said.Soon hell be  Suddenly a wonderful sound rumbled through the room, louder than the remaining guests could speak.Avila sighed.I spoke too soon.Anna spun in her chair to see Ferranti on his feet, raising his hands as though to conduct the beautiful music pouring from every corner of the room.You know what this is?he asked, reaching out a hand in gesture to dance.Its a waltz!she cried, recognising the music she would make Callista play when she visited her as a child.The captain stole her from the chair and they began to dance around the room, albeit badly, laughing hysterically.Glana jumped up and she and Avila joined the waltz.Commander Naffan refused to stand, but a couple of others capered across, entering into the merriment.As they spun, stepped, turned, and interchanged parts, doubling up in wonderful hysterics, Anna finally surrendered control.What was going to happen would happen.Captain Ferranti had taught her one thing: that amongst all the chaos and cold and sadness and death, it was the little things which made a person the most happy.* * *  The Titanese Guard looked into the Crilshan assassins cell.Gordian didnt move.He hadnt spoken all day, not even to the Captain.But now he was staring at the Guard, black and red eyes piercing through his skin and his mind.Something was very wrong.Gordian smirked with an unnatural pleasure.The Guard slammed the hilt of his coil on the opaque, armoured glass.Dont look at me!he said.Gordian remained motionless.Ibrahatima katha.What?Youre going to die first, Gordian said.Very soon, when I get out, Im going to snap your neck.The Guard shuddered.He turned away from the cursed Crilshan and felt his heart race.Clutching his chest, he leaned over.After a moment the pain passed.But he did not turn around again.He could not look at his prisoner anymore.Forty Three      Constantine Lesper stumbled about his office.He knocked a large jar onto the floor, covering the place in a foul smelling liquid.The silver journal in his hand bore his sweaty fingerprints, and he placed it back onto the shelf.Itll be safe here until I come back for it, he mumbled, checking the monitor of his PCD comm.Security footage confirmed that the dock was relatively clear; two or three soldiers on duty.Easy enough to get past.He took hold of his brandy bottle and staggered from the room.His head spun.Legs shook.He wouldnt!Lesper told himself as he descended a narrow ladder well, scuffing his knees on the drop and wiping sweat from his eyelids.WOULD HE NOT?echoed the deep, rolling voice in his head.WOULD HE NOT?He couldnt!YES, HE COULD.I can trust him.The Cronat  NO, YOU CANNOT.YOU DO NOT EVEN KNOW HIM, ASSUMING ITS A HIM AT ALL!Then what do I do?YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO ...Smash!The brandy bottle hed clutched as tight as hed gripped the ladder fell from his hold and coursed down through the next hollow.Damn!Damn!Damn!He left the shattered glass where it was and passed two men guarding the entrance to Section Six.He shouldnt have read Edgars journal; he should have burned it like his Cronat commanded.Ignorance was more than blissful!It had been some days since hed sent the new captain on his furtive mission, and he begged fate that he had found the right man this time.The soldiers would watch the young man.They had been briefed.They knew what they were doing.But after reading the silver journal he realised he had more pressing matters to tackle.Unusually unsteady on his feet he entered into the depths of Section Six.Is Professor Kramer in ...inside?he asked one of the sentries, clutching the wall.No, sir, said one, quite obviously perplexed at the state of his commander.Good ...good!He didnt much fancy sharing the area with Kramer tonight.He hadnt even been sure what he was going to do once he reached Section Six, but he pushed past the guards and entered, making sure the door was properly closed and allowing the low lights to come on by themselves.He made his way over to the command console and typed in the necessary pass codes.All sixteen cages were revealed.Fear and common sense stopped them from opening all cages at once, but tonight he felt unnaturally careless.The fear he experienced when looking at them, he had come to realise, was an addictive terror.There was something that felt almost forbidden about watching them.Especially when they gazed back.The reinforced metal hatches all opened, presenting the armoured, shatterproof clear barriers.Behind them, inside the enclosures, darkness swam.Pure darkness surrounded them.He sighed and leant against the control panel.If Edgars diary was correct then the whole Erebus Project had been a malicious manoeuvre by a foe more dangerous than Lesper could have imagined.They had all been deceived.Lesper tread slowly up to the dark filled cages and peered in.He could see nothing.Only darkness.The Cronat was cunning.But so was he.Tonight was the night he changed everything.Tonight he would destroy Erebus for good.Forty Four      Outpost Aurora was an etiolated frontier soaking in the pastel glow of the remote sun, Accentaurib.It was panoptic in scale, with more space than required.At the extreme edge of the Fourth System it was generally not used to visitors.It had in recent weeks, however, become host to numerous aid vessels aimed at halting the explosive situation currently arising in the planetary systems of the Enusti Empire, which, like Rotavar, had been targeted by Crilshan blockaders.The star speckled sky resembled an ocean of darkness as Anna stood gazing at the projected image on the viewing platform, presenting what would have been seen were there a clear window and not a twenty meter thick wall.Space was a cloud of obscurity, of insignificance; it sparkled with hopeful light and waned in a fashion forsaken, beggaring description.They had stopped the leap some two hours before.The best view of the looming outpost and the planet around which it orbited was to be found right there in the vessels viewing centre.Outpost Aurora circled a chaotic world known as Ammisaduqa.Among its moons there lived the Ammisaduqai: a reclusive people she had only heard of in passing stories back home.Anna knew very little of them, but she did know that the outpost itself was in neither Samosian nor Enusti space.It was separated from all civilization by a million miles.She savoured the pensive hush which filled the room while the crew monitored their stations.According to Captain Ferranti the stopover would be no longer than a few hours.Another Titanese vessel was docked at Aurora; their job was simply to aid its resupply so that it could return to one of the beleaguered worlds of Enustine.War.Nothing but conflict and war.Did these people never tire of clashes and conflicts, disputes and disagreements, all of which were over minor issues truly of no importance?Not like the stories she had heard of Earth.There was never war on Earth.The Von, elected leaders of the paradise, kept the planet safe and beautiful.But Titan was her home, and that was where she would return.The decision had been made.Anna would go home.She smiled at the thought of seeing her uncle, of having him hold her close and protect her again.As she sighed a deep sigh, content in her choice, a dark sphere appeared on the projection screen.Only small, it rose like she imagined the sun would appear over a horizon.In seconds it grew larger and she could make out a dark green veil enveloping the entire globe.It was beautiful.Within minutes they had arrived at Outpost Aurora, and moved slowly through the vast metallic maze of shining steel turrets.She rushed back to her room.Glana had to see it.They would never again get the chance.Out of breath she reached their room.To her surprise, however, she found her sister silently weeping into her pillow.Whats wrong?she asked, closing the hatch and sitting on the bed beside her.Its ...Its nothing, Glana said, sitting up and drying her eyes on her sleeves.Of course theres something.Nobody cries without a reason.I cant, she sobbed, her eyes red and sore.Anna tilted her head.Im your sister.Who else can you tell if not me?Youre the one person I cant tell.Please.Let me be here for you.What is it?Her little sister gulped and sighed deeply.I ...loved Jon.Anna reached out and took her hand.We all loved him.You felt it more.And so did I.   What do you mean?I loved Jon the same way you did, Annie.Anna paused.What are you saying?You know.Please dont make me say it.She sighed.It was obvious you always liked him, sis.Its all right.No.You dont understand.He felt the same.He loved me back.We were ...She turned and looked away.Anna released her sisters hand, stood up, and backed away.Glana followed.Annie, please.Noyoure lying.I cant lie anymore.I dont believe you!Its true.We loved each other.Be quiet!I dont want to hear!We were going to tell you, she said.Thats why he wanted to leave.To leave me.To be with you.Just stop talking.Youre my sister!Im going to be sick, Glana said, and she lurched forward.Be sick then!I dont care!Im ...sorry.She fell to her knees and vomited on the floor, reaching for Annas hand.She pushed her away.Unable to grasp her sisters words Anna left the room and stormed down the corridor.How could the only person she had ever trusted betray her completely?She had lost Jon.The only unchanging memory she had was of a hero, a man she could always count on.That memory faded with each furious step.She hated her sister for taking that away.Things were clear once again.* * *  Antal Justus stepped foot off the Fated Chaos and entered into the hectic floor of Outpost Aurora.His soldiers gathered upon the access ramp behind him.North dock, his lieutenant told him.North dock, he repeated, watching the many men and women go about their business.Were he to squint, he fancied he could see his old crew stood not too far away.Dimal was giving her orders, while Raj taunted Shree, and Noah sat sulking nearby.But it wasnt them.He would never see them again.A loud thud from a hanging crane brought him from his daze.He knew he had to forget them.Leaving Erebus had brought him out of his recent escape.You cant run away from thoughts; theyll follow you to the edge of the universe, and beyond.He turned to his crew, stood waiting.Right, he said.Lets get started.We have work to do, and very little time.* * *  It was not difficult to leave the Stellarstream.Moving through the ships docking bay Anna followed the line of supplies currently being wheeled through and into the Auroran hangar.She made sure Lieutenant Avila was not following then, still wearing the black and gold overalls she had been given on board, made her way along the reinforced passage of tubing from the vessel and through to Aurora.Heavy machinery filled the open spaces while dozens of men and women from all the different docked vessels marched to and fro.The place was alive and bustling and she counted at least seven vessels attached to what was signposted as the south dock of Aurora.Perhaps she could find news of a vessel heading out soon.Maybe she could slip aboard, escape.Provided that it was not going near Titan.She couldnt return there.She had been stupid to think that she could.Facing up to what she had done, the pain and trouble she had caused, was too much.But more than that, she could not bear to look her sister in the eye, could not bear to see her uncle, however much she wanted to have him hold her close.She didnt deserve to go home.Not without Jon.The docks ceiling reached as high as the vessels themselves, and she observed the many tube tunnels leading off from the main dock and into the attached crafts.Behind a large metal drone she stopped and began to cry.She was alone.She knew what she had to do.A hand grasped the back of her jacket.What do you think youre doing?!Anna turned to see Captain Ferrantis concerned face.I was  Never mind.Come on!He pulled her with him and quick marched her through the dock.I really hope you werent thinking of skipping off again, Anna.I think youve put your family through enough!She already felt guilty, but coming from him it hurt that much more.I wasnt ...I was just  A strong form knocked into her before she could finish.She glanced at his face and her heart skipped a beat.Oh, Im sorry, Miss, the man said.I  She was back in her dream.The darkness surrounding her.The orb burned black.GILAXIAD!A hand touched her shoulder.GILAXIAD!The pale face of the man stood with her.Anna!Anna!She opened her eyes, shied away from the bright light.Ferrantis panicked face looked down.A crowd had formed.And the face of  You!she gasped, gazing up into the face of the man from her nightmares.You!Im sorry, he said.I didnt mean to knock you over.Im sorry.Anna sat up, realising she had fallen to the ground in her fit, and was now drenched in sweat, her heart beating madly.Its ...all right, she said.It wasnt you.I guess I ...fainted.All the same, he said, a look of worry on his pale, youthful face.With the help of Ferranti and the strange man she found her feet and the crowd dispersed, muttering amongst themselves disappointedly.Thank you, Ferranti said to the man, before whisking Anna away.She turned as they left and watched the man glance back at her.A shiver ran the length of her spine.Who was that?she asked Ferranti as he steered her back through to the Titanese vessel.Ive seen him before.I daresay you have, he said.Perhaps youve seen a picture of him at the Institute.Id say by his uniform hes rather high ranking.Handsome too.Anna looked at the growing smile on his face and grinned back.Come to think of it, he did seem familiar.Though a little worse for wear after the previous night of revelry, Ferranti suggested that they take a walk.Anna agreed, happy to explore the outpost.The two walked together through the south dock, along the stations connecting passages, and amongst the comings and goings of the equally busy north dock.She didnt want to go back to the ship and see her sister; she was happy thinking about other things for the time being.The two stopped walking in one of the passages that connected the two sides of the base, and looked out of the long pane of glass at the dark green waves of the storm clouds over Ammisaduqa.Out of the window behind they could see all of the nearby docked vessels.None of the other ships were as large as the Stellarstream and so many of the crews were rather small in comparison.Beyond the masses of metal was nothing less than infinite space.Is that all there is out there?she asked him.I mean, thats all there is to see?That depends upon what you do see, Anna.Everyone sees something different.Some see the future and others see the past; some see what could have been, and even more what they want to be.And some, he whispered, staring her in the eye, go mad.Im not sure what I see, she said.Though Id love to be able to see how far it goes one day.How far above or below I can reach.He chuckled to himself and swept one of his curls over his ear.Space isnt like an ocean, Anna, and technically our vessels arent called ships.People really only call them that because its simple.What are they called?He cleared his throat.Interstellar spacecraft transports.Spaceship sounds better!she said.I actually agree, he grinned.Curious girl, arent you?Anything else you want to know while we have the time?Well ...yes, she said.So much.Fire away.How ...How does it work ...the interstellar spacecraft transport?He chuckled again.You havent studied that at the Institute?Not quite yet.I dont think so, anyway.He leant on the railing and cocked his head as though thinking carefully.When the original colonies of Luna and Mars were first founded, he said, were talking millennia ago now, old methods of nuclear fusion were used.When it came to exploring Proxima, antimatt power proved pivotal.That sped up colonization, but never enough to get us to the point we are now.No, it was the technological revolution of the twenty third century that gave us the gift of space travel.Ultimatt energy acted much like Robotic Intelligence did centuries after its discovery.Everybody that goes through the Institute learns about Sik Whang and Petra Markathe great scientists who created the first ultimatt engine.Wait!she said.Just wait.Slow down.You said ultimatter works like Robotic Intelligence did.But in what way?Ferranti turned and walked back across to the opposite window.Anna followed.Its never been proven, he said.Nobody I know would have the faintest idea where to begin, of course.But it has always been said that these engines ...ultimatt engines ...that theyre alive.Alive?How?Im no scientist, but I do know that energy can be neither created nor destroyed, nor harvested indefinitely.Energy stays the sameit is only transferred.There was a time when unlimited power sources didnt exist, long ago now.And because of that the light speed barrier couldnt be broken.We could not make the leap.Humanity knew that.Then what changed?We did.What?She leaned closer.Ferranti cleared his throat.The theory goes: life is unpredictable, life is the only thing that changes, the only thing we cannot foretell or prophesize.Sounds like rubbish to me.He leaned back on the railing and seemed to think carefully of an answer.Its a hard concept to grasp, he said.Most of it is unexplained, mysterious.Simply put, ultimatt engines are supposed to be living ...everlasting.The radiation our engines leave behindradiation which allows faster than light travel through the Systems, leaping from one planet to anotherthat radiation leaves a detectable pathway through space.So when were leaping, were not leaping blind.Were following the paths already laid before us.Like footprints in space.I never knew.Its real?Oh, its real alright.Its just difficult to handle for most.Why?Because they dont understand it, Anna.They cant control it.Is that what happened with Callista?With the Istrons?Ferranti took a long pause, before looking at Anna and sighing.Yes.Forty Five      Lesper clapped his hands over his ears, closed his eyes, and attempted to shut out the horror as a deafening hiss devoured the room.The lights within the cage containing the last of the beasts poured into the enclosure; a flickering poison disturbed only by the erratic movements of the creature within.He forced himself to watch the dying demon.After this he would only have Subject Sixteen to deal with.The terrifying scream reached its peak, piercing Lespers eardrums with the synchronised sound of a thousand deadly serpents.The fifteenth and last beast charged about the cage, violently slamming into its sides, horns and claws striking the glass.And if Lesper had heeded the threat, he may have feared that it would get free.Then at once the sound stopped.He turned the light off.The beast was dead.He left the hatch up, still revealing the thing as it lay, like the others, unmoving.He watched it for several minutes after which he turned his attention to Subject Sixteen.Of all the creatures within Section Six, number sixteen was special.Because number sixteen they had not found inside the asteroid Erebus.Nor had they brought it with them.This one they had created themselves.The beasts didnt scare Lesper; not as much as this thing anyhow.It was an abomination.It deserved to die.It was a mistake he never should have made.He stepped back towards the console  What are you doing?!Lesper spun to see Xerin Kramer stood at the opposite end of the room, eyeing the exposed cages.The Professor took a nervous step into the room, the door closing behind him.Whats that I can smell?he said.Have you been drinking?The Commander shifted.What are all the cages doing open?Get away from there now!Kramer shouted.He stepped forward again, and Lesper backed up, leaving the control panel between them.How long have you known me, Xerin?Kramer inched closer.Long enough to know this isnt you.HES WRONG ...Lespers neck twitched.And we always thought what we were doing here was for the betterment of mankind.It was, Kramer said.It is!I dont think so.Not anymore.What arent you telling me, Lesper?I read Edgar Mokrikovs journal.The one he asked for.I wish I hadnt.You did what?!You dont understand!But I do.Weve been used all this time.The Cronat intends to kill us when its all over.When weve succeeded in the task he set us.I have to kill it.He glanced back.A shadow stirred within cage sixteen.Youre not going to kill it, Lesper.Why?Lesper wiped sweat from over his eyes.After all, we made him!Were the cruel monsters who created this thing.He is no more a beast than I am!Constantine, stop it.Dont you remember?he said.It happened right here.The captain said no.You hit him.I knocked him unconscious  Stop it!How proud you must be.Kramer pulled a small blaster from his black coat and aimed it in his commanders direction.Lesper simply smiled.Do it, he said.Dont make me beg.Kramer lowered the weapon.Lesper stepped away from the cage.I want to end it.You and I both know that there's something else going on here, Xerin.This place isn't derelict, not by far.We found life on it for goodness sake.This place is altogether  Alien?Lesper shuddered.The throbbing in his head ceased.He felt clear headed, sober, steadfast.I think its time we shut this operation down.Constantine, we've worked together for as long as I can recall.You remember we would speak for hours about just how momentous our find was, and still is.No discovery like this has ever been found.We'd be complete fools to abandon it, to ignore the secrets it holds.Even if those secrets end up destroying us, along with everyone else here?Youre not the only one to have studied this place in its entirety, my friend.Whatre you talking about?I think you know, Xerin.These creatures aren't the only secret this hell hole is hiding.The question we need to be asking is not what they are, but where they came from.And if they're the ones in the cages ...then who really has the keys?You fear the Masters may return?Lespers eyes widened.I fear they never left.Kramer did not answer.It is fear which brought us here, to this point, Xerin.Fear of the unknown.Its time to leave.Kramer crossed his arms over his chest.What would you have us do?Evacuate the station.Destroy the thing altogether.Set some charges and get the hell off this rock!The Professor laughed.If I did that Id be destroying the best chance of understanding this universe humanity has ever had.But at what cost?Damn it, Kramer!This place bleeds malevolence!Lesper put his hands behind his head, tearing where there was no hair to tear.He had hoped it wouldnt come to this.BUT IS HAS.KRAMER HAS FORCED YOUR HAND.IT IS UP TO YOU NOW.DO IT!This alien station and its secrets can offer more than just answers, Kramer pleaded.Erebus will stop the inevitable conflict escalating among the Systems ...burning at the heart of the Alignment itself.The Cronat said so.The Cronat has used us!Erebus will rise to glory, Ill make sure of it!The army we can create would halt war in the Systems altogether!But Lesper wasnt listening.Stepping toward the command console he gazed at his reflection in the metal, eyes wide and unsettling, dark with the distress of trauma and age.His gaze shot up as Kramer stepped closer one more time, blaster raised to chest height, his expression a combination of irritation and terror.Step away from the console, he said.Youre not going to shoot me, Lesper said.And theres one more thing I have to do.I have to kill our creation.No, you dont.Lesper drove the lever down and the light inside cage sixteen surged through.They both shielded their faces.A deafening hiss sounded, but it was louder than the others, and it sent shivers down Lespers spine like nothing else ever could.Kramer sprang across and knocked him aside.He slammed the lights in the cage off.However, the shrieking and hissing did not stop as before.The beast continued to throw its weight around in the darkness, pummelling the glass, threatening to break free.Lesper knew his greatest fear ...or at least he thought he did.As he looked within the cage and into the glowing eyes of the creature he had once known as a man, his true fear dawned on him.And then it came true.The first fifteen caged beasts, creatures he had thought were dead, began hissing wildly too, ramming the mighty glass walls.Close the hatches!Kramer screamed.Seal the cages!Theyre not dead!Lesper went to do so.But then it happened.The two men looked to each other with expressions of dread as a powerful crack sounded, followed by the deafening shatter of glass.No ...An alarm sounded.The two soldiers stationed outside the room charged in, bright red coilbolts ignited; but their assaults were worthless.The great beast that was Subject Sixteen charged across the room and tore them asunder.Blood and soaring flesh replaced the sickening screams in seconds.Kramer fell to the ground as Lesper rammed him out of the way.The Commander forced an old bookshelf aside, placed his thumb on the scanner, sunk into the wall.As the creature turned, covered in blood, it stared at Lesper; a piercing gaze.Hatred.And Lesper twisted, and cast himself down the dark escape tunnel, leaving his old friend with the beast as the hatch slammed closed behind him.Forty Six      Perched in a far corner of the noisy mess hall of Outpost Aurora, Anna looked up.The pale faced man she had collided with earlier marched into the large room and sat down with half a dozen other men, also adorned in black uniforms.She watched them intently.Seeing the man a second time only made her sure: he was the man from her nightmares.He not only looked like him, but she felt something stir inside her when she saw his face.Perhaps he knew something of the Gilaxiad.Captain Ferranti sat eating silently beside her.She pushed her tray aside and continued to watch the pale man and his crew.Where could he be from?Whats caught your attention?Ferranti asked her.She nodded her head in the black clad crews direction.What do you suppose theyre saying?He glanced over at the table where the mysterious captain sat; he looked to be the only one talking.Who knows?Cant we find out who he is?He eyed her suspiciously.Why so curious?Because, I told you, I have definitely seen that man before.Id just like to know where from, thats all.Ferranti frowned and Anna raised her eyebrows piteously, the way she always did when she wanted something from her uncle.It only ever worked with him, however; her sister and Callista were much too wary.I shouldnt, he said.Hes done nothing to warrant my suspicion, or yours.Go on, she said.Break the rules for once.Please?He placed his cup down.Okay, fine.He lifted a small, tubular device from within his jacket.Whats that?Never you mind.He pointed the device covertly in the mans direction, zoomed in, and quickly snapped an image of his face.A minute passed, then it bleeped and an extract appeared on the devices long screen.Ferranti gazed at it in silence.What?she said.What?What is it?Surprisingly serious, Ferranti breathed in, held the device towards her.TITANESE DATASTORE  FILE: __UNKNOWN PERSON__      Searching ..............................................................IMAGE FOUND:  SEARCH RESULT:      VIOLENT CRIMINAL  ANTAL JUSTUS  OFFICIALS ARE SEEKING ANY AND ALL INFORMATION ON ANTAL JUSTUS, A NATIVE OF PLANET EARTH AND CAPTAIN OF THE STAYREADY MODEL OF SHIP KNOWN AS THE CRIMSON FLUX.HE IS WANTED IN FOUR STELLAR SYSTEMS AND FIFTEEN PLANETARY SYSTEMS IN CONNECTION WITH CRIMES INCLUDING THEFT, MURDER, TERRORISM, AND TREASON ...CONSIDERED ARMED AND EXTREMELY DANGEROUS      Anna searched Ferrantis expression for some clue as to what he would do, her own filled with nothing less than absolute disbelief.What are you doing?she asked.Thinking.Diego ...Let me think, Anna!What are you going to do?Ferranti went to speak when a siren sounded suddenly in the mess hall, echoing throughout the connecting passages.Anna covered her ears.Everybody sat around the dozen tables jumped to their feet, weapons to hand.But Antal Justus remained where he was.The siren continued and he climbed up onto one of the tables.Listen up, everyone!he shouted above the din.I am captain of the vessel Fated Chaos.Moments ago we received intelligence pointing to an imminent attack on this outpost!None of your vessels currently docked here are safe, and we must for the meantime assume that all are compromised.The Fated Chaos is, however, safe and ready for immediate departure!I will ask you all to make your way towards my ship, stationed at the edge of the north dock.You may return in due course, once the threat has been resolved.At once Ferranti seized Anna by her arm, and before she could open her mouth he forced her away from the direction the crowd of panicked crews were being herded.Justus soldiers spread out and directed everyone through the exit on the other side of the hall.What are you doing?she cried.Werent you listening to him?Considering what weve just learnt about the captain there, he said, Id be inclined not to trust a single word he says!Captain!As they reached the corridor leading from the great room they turned to see a flustered and panicked Lieutenant Avila running towards them.We know, said Ferranti.Now we  No, Captain!she said, attempting to overcome the alarming distress signal.I know about the threat!But we have a bigger problem.Speak.Its Gordian.What?Hes not in his cell.His guard is ...dead.What?!Sir, hes escaped!NO!Anna cried.Glanas still on the Stellarstream!She pushed Ferranti out of the way  Anna, no!Forty Seven      Araman Alwars eyes shot open.Distressed, he jolted into a seated position and slammed his forehead into the cabinet above his bed.Dull pain joined the unnerving sense of disorientation, intensified a thousand fold with the piercing siren and intermittent flashes of burning red light now flooding his quarters.The latter caused all of his equipment piled up around him to spread numerous shadows darting through the confined space with a startling delirium.He rubbed the throbbing lump on his forehead, then reached beneath his pillow and pulled out a torch.The wailing alarm stopped, though the power remained off.Flashing red light continued to provide enough light for him to dress, pick up an advanced coilbolt, and charge from his room.Down the windowless corridor people surged from their roomshalf dressed, flustered, and groaning.Araman knew where to go.All station personnel were to head straight to the barracks as a safety precaution if such an alarm sounded.Red light meant one thing: danger.Araman, however, circumvented everyone else and headed straight for the dock.Since Commander Lesper had sent Captain Justus away on the Fated Chaos, for whatever reason, there was only one craft left.If something were to happen to it ...Whos there?someone said as he entered the dark of the dock.Torchlight gestured frantically.Its Araman!he replied, lighting his own torch.Whats the problem?A soldier rushed towards him; Araman recognised the frightened face of one Private Riess.Emergency procedure s ...seven, sir, he said.Whats your name, Private?Riess.No, whats your name?Stuttering, he said, Its C ...Carlos, s ...sir.Okay, Carlos.Procedure seven, you say?Thats an alert.Whats caused the power loss?First and s ...second generators, sir.It s ...seems both have stopped w ...working.Pine and Azal have gone down to Section Two t ...t ...to check it out.Araman placed a hand on his shoulder.Relax, Carlos.I'll follow them down.Go and check communications on board the Nyx.Right away, sir!The soldier hurried up the ramp of the nearby craft.Emergency procedure seven was indeed an alert.It also meant an attack on the station.But the dock was clear.Shivers flew down his spine as the only explanation drove fear through his bones.It was them.He recalled what he had seen in Section Six: those creatures had hated the light.It was almost fatal.If they had escaped they were all sitting ducks without power to see or protect them.Their only hope was resetting the generators in Section Two.If only that section wasnt below the surface ...Araman swiped his access fob onto the wall panel.The metal gate groaned open.He stepped inside the empty elevator, which pulled him down to the lower levels.The elevator door opened at the bottom with a sharp, haunting groan.He shone his light into the dark, half expecting someone or something to be waiting for him.But there was no one.Nothing.He moved down the dark hallway.Section Two was surrounded by maintenance tunnels.It was agonisingly hot.But he wasnt sweating from the heat.He was sure the tunnel was narrowing, and he shone his light above and to the sides, shadows flitting about all over the leaking walls.Nothings down here with you.Youre fine!No!he said, reaching down to his side, realising he hadn't picked up his comm.No way to communicate with the others.He was on his own until he found Pine or Azal.He turned another corner.No sign of them.Where the hell were they?He continued through and moved right ...or was it meant to be straight on?His decision was made for him when the echo of a voice resonated through the tunnel to his right.He paused for a second, replaying the sound in his head; was it a voice or a scream?He took the turning and began moving faster.Rotating left he gripped the coilbolt loosely in his right hand.He heard no more voices.All noise had disappeared, leaving behind the steady hissing of pressure valves along the corridor approaching the generators.He was sure he could make out the faint smell of burning.Perhaps the generators had merely overheated.The two soldiers would come around the corner laughing and joking any moment.Gripping his weapon tighter he slowly descended a set of greasy stepladders.It was pitch black.He could only see a little at a time, thanks to his flashlight, which he could swear was getting dimmer.At the bottom of the ladders he stopped.This was it.The generator room.He couldn't quite make out just how many generators there were.Generators one and two ...where were they?Pine?he said.Azal?His calls amounted to no more than petrified whispers.Privates?He was regretting his decision to follow them down.He wanted to get the hell out at once.In that moment Araman could make out another light ahead, behind one of the smaller generators.He stepped closer, bent down as he reached around.The light pointed away, up towards the wall.Wait.On the floor.In the path of light.A patch of something sliding along the floor.Was that ...could it be ...blood?And  Araman shot upright, moved back against the wall, frozen with fear.His blood iced over.His heart raced.Something lurked in the shadows.Shaking, he could just make out the front of a face.But above it thrust two pointed barbs.Two black horns.Perhaps it didn't know he was there.Perhaps it knew before he had entered the room.He couldn't tell if it was looking at him.He bit through his lip to stop himself from whimpering.What if he was surrounded?He could taste the blood as it filled his desiccated mouth.Should he run?Would he even make it out of the room were he to try?He took a gulp, swallowing the blood built up in his throat, and chose to run.Darting from the shadows Araman shot across the room, not daring to look behind at whether the demon had taken chase.In seconds he was at the ladders, and without looking up climbed, climbed as fast as he could.He lost his grip, but the adrenaline flowing through him kept him going.Grasping the top he felt a vibration on the ladders below.He knew what it was but refused to look down.He ran.Faster than he had ever run in his life.He reached for his weapon, but in his haste dropped it behind him.He stopped, turning to reach back for it.A huge, black figure appeared at the top of the ladders.He froze again, unable to move, petrified in his place.The creature glided forwards in the dark, moving its large, horned skull from side to side.All went silent as it appeared slowly above him, hissing soft and threatening.Whether out of coincidence or complete and utter luck, without warning the pressure valves lining the dark tunnel fizzled on and the creature moved back.The hissing rolled into a dull roar.Araman seized the moment, forgetting about his weapon, and charged away.He scrambled desperately through his pockets for the access fob as he neared the elevator.He just had to get inside it.He reached the door.Swiped his fob.The door opened.Too slow.He wasn't going to make it.COME ON!FOR GODS SAKE COME ON!He spun.Something fast approached in the dark.Dropping to his hands and knees he crawled beneath the shutter.He slammed his fist into the switch and the reinforced outer door slammed shut.A petrifying hiss enclosed him in his metal cage.Araman took several deep breaths and held his head in his hands.Erebus had fallen.He had to get out.Forty Eight      Diego Ferranti spun on the spot.But Anna dodged his outstretched arm and tore for the south dock of Aurora.Heading in the opposite direction, the throng of multiple crews surged for the north docked Fated Chaos.Go after her!Ferranti told Avila, and the lieutenant took chase.Gordian escaped ...Aurora in danger ...could it be mere coincidence, or a malevolent twist of fate?Ferranti watched Avila set off in pursuit, and then turned to run through a nearby access tunnel.The Station Control Room was the best place to discover what was really going on.Before the captain had even left the hall, however, he found several soldiers blocking his path.The criminal Antal Justus presented himself at the forefront.May I ask you to follow my men back to the north dock?Justus said.Its not safe here.No, its not, the blond captain countered.I have an escaped prisoner.An urgent threat I must deal with immediately.Im going to station control.Didnt you hear what I said?I heard perfectly.Ferranti turned, but found his path blocked once again.Justus held his arm against the wall, blocking the way.The Station Commander is on route to my ship.Youll find nothing in the Control Room.Then Ill return to my ship.I cant allow that.Im going to have to insist you come with us.Thats not going to happen, Captain.I am a captain myself.My duty is to my crew, not to you.I am going to my ship, right now.He placed his hand on the hilt of his holstered coilbolt.Very well, Justus said.But Ill be going with you.He turned to the snobbish looking pirate behind him.Take your team and gather all passengers from the remaining ships.Split up.You have ten minutes.* * *  Anna tore through the long tube tunnel leading from Aurora to the Stellarstream.The rolling siren fell into the background and the dock behind disappeared.She had never moved so fast.Forgetting her earlier conversation with her sister, she knew only that she had to get to her.The crew of the Stellarstream piled along the armoured tunnel, but Anna didnt care about them; she was focused, in a way she had never been focused before.Disorientated, she almost lost her way, and once she reached their quarters found Glana wasnt there.Anna bunched her hands into fists.She would find her sister; she only hoped Gordian hadnt gotten to her first.Considering the possibility that shed slipped out with the crew, Anna charged out and back down the corridor.Minutes passed as she drove herself on.Then she stopped dead at the entrance to the tunnel leading back to the outpost.The black and red eyed assassin stood in her path, restraining a trembling Glana.A blaster prodded her face.Please, she said, tears in her eyes.Gordian smiled.A blast of blue light came from within the tunnel, slammed into his side, throwing him into the wall.Avila came dashing down the hall, coil raised and glowing, and cried, Anna, take your sister!Run!* * *  Antal Justus tread two paces ahead.Ferranti saw no other option and loosened his coil, slipping it into his palm.Correct me if Im wrong, he said as the two captains marched into the open area of the south dock, but is it not the job of the Station Commander to issue the proper evacuation procedures already set in place?The Station Commander is indisposed, Justus said without looking back.Hes being taken to my ship right now.My crew is dealing with the threat.You say threat, said Ferranti.But, wait.Hold on, Justus.What kind of threat is it?The criminal stopped.I mentioned a threat.But I didnt tell you my name ...A length of metal found his grasp.The hum of a coilbolt sounded.In a split second Justus had leaned forward, ignited the weapon, and twisted his body, moving to strike the captain behind.But Ferranti was ready, and with one fell swoop lunged forwards with his own already triggered.They clashed in a rain of dancing sparks.Their weapons hissed at each other.Faces mere inches from supercharged metal.Justus pushed Ferranti backward.He stumbled before triggering a burst of blue electricity straight at his enemy, expecting to put him out with ease.Justus caught the blast with his own red glowing coil.Whoa!Ferranti said.No coils capable of that!The criminal laughed, flipped his coil back and then forwards like a whip, and returned a torrent of red lightning.Ferranti threw himself to the ground, the blistering heat assaulting the nape of his neck.Again he launched an assault himself.The boom of each eardrum shattering strike thundered through the space.Another attack caught Justus by surprise and he was forced to his left.The blast made contact with a nearby standing auto cannon, rupturing its armour, and causing an explosion to fill the hangar.Both turned to see a cargo mass of volatile explosives go up in smoke and fierce flame; the ensuing heat reaching across the platform.Booms and rattles of gunfire echoed in close proximity as if in reply.The flash of a coil joined in.A small group of soldiers, some Titanese, backed into the dock.But they were not alone.Justus black clad crew forced their way through, striking down several with the same crimson beamed weapons as their captain.Oh, no.Ferranti moved to stand at the entrance to the passage through to the Stellarstream, blocking his enemy from entering.I know who you are!he cried.Why are you doing this?!Come with me and Ill show you, Justus said.The truth would blow your mind!Everything you thought you knew will change!I know theres no threat!No ones going with youIll make sure of it!Justus smiled.Fine by me.* * *  Anna stood still at the end of the tunnel as both captains fired their coilbolts.The cracks and booms echoed all around, the hangar filled with a blinding light, and both were sent soaring.Ferranti was thrown into a heap of crates nearby; his weapon fell metres away.Justus landed on his back, and at once pulled himself up from the ground.Three of Justus men charged over.One went straight for Ferranti and raised his limp body up against the crates.She had to do something.But what?Carefully lowering Glanas unconscious body to the ground she started to back up into the tube tunnel.Stop there, Justus commanded.Anna froze.Come over here.No!He held his exotic looking coil up to Ferranti's neck.Anna breathed in deep, then did as she was told, leaving Glana where she lay, just out of sight.Lieutenant, Justus said.Yes, Captain?He motioned to Ferranti.Restrain this one and take him back to the ship.Prepare to leave.The charges are all set.We're going immediately.Right away, Captain.What charges?Anna said, moving from the tunnel to approach the pale captain.Justus exhaled.Not to worry.Come with me and you won't get hurt.He held out his hand.She's going nowhere!Anna turned to see Lieutenant Avila stood at the other end of the corridor, coilbolt spitting and aimed at Justus.She propped up a semi conscious Gordian, but seeing the scene in front of her dropped him to the ground.Before she realised what had happened, Anna felt a hand wrap painfully around her chest.A burning sensation stung her throat.Back off!Justus yelled, holding his charged blade up to her neck.Avila stepped forward, her weapon intended for the assailant.Stop!Anna cried.Get back inside!The stations set to explode!Take Glana with you!Avila looked down at Glana, collapsed beside Gordian.We're going nowhere without you!Don't come any closer, Justus warned.Not unless you want to be responsible for her death.Anna struggled; the intensity of the blade scalded her neck.You won't touch her, spoke a cold, deep voice.Not unless you want to die yourself.Annas heart missed a beat.Gordian wavered alongside Avila, holding out Ferrantis coilbolt, not at Avila, but in Justus direction.There'll be no one dying here today, the pale captain replied.She felt his grip on her tighten.Now, you're both going to put down your weapons, slowly, and come with me.Like hellfire we are!Avila said.We're evacuating this station.One way or another.Gordian advanced a small step.We're going nowhere with you  Flung backward, a projectile struck the Crilshan from the other side of the dock.Avila twisted and Annas captor took the opening, whipping his coilbolt forward and releasing a deadly burst, knocking Avila into the interior wall of the passage.Justus men ran towards them, as Anna kicked and screamed.One took hold of Glana, throwing her over his shoulder.Leave the others, Justus said.There arent enough of us to carry them.We have to go!Avila and Gordian were left, unconscious, among the dead of outpost Aurora.Anna could not find the energy to struggle or even to make a sound.Doomed, she permitted the men to pull her through the empty station, lined with the bodies of those men and women that had fought back; and, along with Glana and Ferranti, was hauled through into Antal Justus craft.Forty Nine      Breathing deeply and clutching his mutinous heartbeat, Lesper crept out of his escape tunnel and peered into the dark corridor, before entering the still passage and quickening his pace.Out of breath, the brandys restless effect still at hand, he reached the last access gate before the hangar, and exhaled with relief.Hed not let them out.It hadnt happened.BUT IT HAS.BECAUSE OF YOU!Every last person was going to die ...hundreds of them.And yet all he could think about was reaching the Nyx and getting as far away as he could.He could hear screams, gunshots, and the booms of electric weapons.The beasts must have attacked the barracks.Coilbolts would not be enough to stop them.He had been foolish to think that a strike from the advanced coils would do anything at all.They were already dead.All of them.None would survive.Reaching the hangar he twisted, fighting the rising lump in his throat.He met a sharp corner as a soldier sprang from hiding.Private Riess!Lesper cried, forcing his words, half composed and far from calm.Everything okay down here?S ...Seems so, sir, he said, raising his coil as a scream filled the corridor behind.What the hell is g ...going on?Don't worry, Private.Its coming from Section Four.The acoustics in this place make it seem as though it's in here, but its not.What do you mean, it?What is it?Riess asked.It doesn't matter.Hows the Nyxs status?Emergency protocol, sir.Ships powered up and set to go.Good.In that case, come on.We're leaving.What?!We can't l ...leave, sir.The others, they need us!The Nyx is the only ship here!We cant t ...t ...take it!Riess moved past Lesper, his attention on the advancing screams.We have to help them.We cant help them, Private.I'm not leaving them!Araman went into Section Two.Hell be back any moment.Im not waiting!The beasts were coming.They would come bursting through at any time.If only Kramer had made it out alive ...Gunshots rattled closer.Last chance, Private.What in hells name is going on, Commander?Riess cried.Lesper spied the frightened soldier's holstered blaster.He grasped it and smashed Riess over the back of the skull.He fell to his knees, clutching his head.Stupid boy, he said, and he turned and staggered onto the Nyx.He slammed the palm of his hand onto the control.The ramp closed behind.The craft was powered up and standing by, ready to leave.Lesper fastened himself in and engaged the primary gates above, releasing the shuttles clamps and inhibitors.He smiled as the ship's clamps retracted from the bay and he lifted up and out through another level.Leaving Erebus behind.Sitting back in the pilot's seat he closed his eyes and sighed deeply.He had made it.A noise sounded behind him.An awful smell knocked him sick.He didn't look.
