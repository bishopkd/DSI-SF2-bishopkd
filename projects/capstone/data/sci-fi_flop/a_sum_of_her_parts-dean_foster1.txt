The monster was gruff but polite, with an accent inclining to the French.As she contemplated the hulking sack of bipedal testosterone looming athwart the road, Ingrid could understand why he might prefer to intercept them outside of town and away from staring crowds.Even in a world populated by weird and eccentric Melds, the freewalkers appearance was outlandish.And make no mistake about it: he had intended to intercept them.Just the way he stared in their direction was proof enough that his presence on the otherwise empty dirt track was no accident.She and Whispr were almost a full day out from Orangemund on the single road leading northroad being far too flattering a description for the ancient 44 trail.There was no indication that it had recently been utilized by machine or man.In this forbidding desert terrain a floater, any kind of floater, would be a more sensible way of getting around.So what little track still existed was not maintained.In any event, the linear remains would shortly peter out in the flat gravel plain and they would have to rely solely on the positioning components in their communicators and the secret route that had been given to them by Morgan Ouspel.Orangemund lay behind them.In every other direction was the emptiness of the Namib; sand and gravel, sun and scrub, and the bluest sky she had ever seen.Except directly ahead, where stood a monster.A description unbecoming to a physician, she chided herself.The freewalker wasnt really a monster; only one of the more radical Melds she had ever encountered.She could hardly be blamed for her initial reaction.Certainly she had seen nothing so outlandish in Savannah, or even in her med school studies.Extreme conditions called for extreme manips, she realized, and there were few places on the planet more extreme than the Namib desert.How she had come to find herself afoot at the southern edge of the Namib in the company of two Meldsone jumpy and unpredictable, the other exotic and intimidatingwas a tale of searching and discovery that in retrospect seemed far more dream than reality.Of one thing, however, she could be absolutely certain: it was a long way from her familiar family practice and her comfortable codo back home.While the freewalker studied them she returned the favor.As near as she could tell he was somewhere in his forties.Either side of that she could not have hazarded a guess.Not considering how his body had been pushed, pulled, bloated, coated, maniped, and remelded.In some ways the melding that had been carried out was more extreme than that required to make a Martian, though less so than what was necessary to produce a viable Titanite.As the integrated autostabilizer adjusted her backpacks position, a glance to the left revealed that Whispr was eyeing the hulk with his usual wariness.You a riffler?His tone was sour, his stance edgy.The sunscreen maniped pupils of tiny eyes peered down at Ingrids companion out of a wide, almost flattened head.The bald pate was composed of multiple folds of melded skin, each one intended to dissipate a little more of the skulls internal heat.Only at the forehead, where the edges of individual layers of skin overlaid one another like exfoliating granite, was the melding evident.The lowest folds combined to create a flexible, almost prehensile brow that further served to protect the vulnerable eyes from blowing dust and a pitiless sun.Names Quaffer.Im no riffler.Im a registered guide.Work at it, live by it, made for it.None better between Alexander Bay and Cape Cross.Id like to guide you.A flattened hand the size of a dinner plate gestured casually northward.You going any distance this way, you going to need a guide.His voice was deep and booming, though whether the reverberation was due to his height, size, or the mantalike manip on his back Ingrid could not tell.Spread high and wide, the sweeping dorsal area had been radically maniped to permit long term survival in the desert.Supported by bone ladled extensions to his ribs, the fleshy addition was nothing less than a mass of gengineered water holding cells.The internal plumbing necessary to supply such a growth with water from his throat or stomach had to be more complicated and extensive than the maniped water sac itself.The basic design was simple and practical.As Quaffers body utilized the water stored in his back meld it would gradually shrink, like the fat stored in a camels hump.When completely empty the fleshy extension would lie flat and loose against his spine.Though the deeply tanned flesh would also double as a sun shield that was not why the freewalker wore no shirt.To make one would require the skills not of a tailor but of a sail maker.Below the waist and the bulging storage meld, distant from the flattened skull and tiny eyes protected from the glare, the guides body was almost normal.Unable to position a pack on his greatly maniped back, Quaffer employed oversized pants pockets and a lightweight valise to carry his gear.As storage it appeared insufficient.But then, Ingrid reminded herself, he did not need to tote water.She wondered if he made sloshing sounds when he walked.What she said was, Thanks, but we dont need a guide.Expression set, Whispr nodded slowly.Were fine on our own.From a greater height, downsized eyes regarded him sharply.Nobody is fine on their own in the Namib.Were only going out a little ways.Ingrid tried a friendly smile.Were here to look for birds, and other wildlife, and to experience the sights and the sounds of the desert.On our own.Reaching back, she indicated her pack.We have enough supplies to stay out for a week or more if we want.Wildlife?A thin laugh emerged from the wide mouth.It was nearly lipless, the horizontal fleshy pads having been maniped away.Nonexistent lips could not chap in the heat and wind.There is some, but without a guide you will not see it.Except for maybe lizards and snakes.You get a cobra in your sleepsheet and you will wish you had hired someone who knows how to keep them away.He shook his head regretfully.I have guided many visitors.I know people, and I can tell that you are not the kind to spend a week in the desert looking for animals.Despite the fact that the big freewalker outweighed him in water content alone, Whispr took a challenging step forward.You dont know what kind of people we are, or what were looking for.Haw!I think maybe I do.The guide nodded past the infinitely slimmer Meld, in the direction of the low lying buildings of Orangemund.I live here all year round.Quaffer knows everybody, and everybody knows Quaffer.Acutely aware of their recent clandestine meeting with the Nerens refugee Morgan Ouspel, Whispr was immediately on guard.It must be nice to be popular.The big Melds hand shifted slightly to his left.Anyone in their right mind who comes to this faraway place looking for wildlife looks for it on or beside the river.The only people who search for animals in the desert are scientists.Biologists, zoologists.Herpetologists and entomologists.His gaze narrowed even more.Are you two scientists?Maybe.Ingrid was startled at the ease with which she responded.Something else she had acquired since partnering up with the street wise Whispr, she realized.Confidence in her ability to formulate a viable lie.What business of yours are our professions?Quaffer looked more amused than offended.A guide should know all he can about those for whom he is responsible.I should know if you are like helpless children in the desert, or if you are experienced.You dont need to know anything.As he started around the freewalker Whispr pulled his communicator.Were going.If you try to stop us Ill notify the police.He allowed himself a knowing smirk.Since you say everybody knows you, Im willing to bet that the police do too.I dont want to hinder your progress, the big Meld rumbled.I want to assist it.There is no way you are going to get deep into the Sperrgebeit without help.Whispr gave an exaggerated roll of his eyes.What makes you think we want to get deep into the Sperrgebeit?The freewalkers tone changed perceptibly.Like I said, I know everyone, everyone knows me.Maybe I hear some thingsabout you.Ingrid shot her companion a worried look.Though far from intimidated, Whispr was suddenly cautious.You dont know anything.You havent heard anything.Youre fishing.Perhaps a little, Quaffer confessed.No harm in that.As he shifted his feet the melded water sac that was part of his back answered Ingrids earlier unvoiced question by emitting a soft gurgling sound.I suppose you could be scientists.Lets say that you are.In that case you would not have to pay me for my help.I would freely guide you for a share in whatever, um, scientific discoveries you might make.As she frowned at him Ingrid wished they were having this conversation under cover.Except for the town behind them and mountains off to the east, there was nothing for kilometers in any direction that would qualify as shade.I dont understand.How could we share a scientific discovery with you?The lipless mouth broke into a knowing grin.I know that there are all kinds of science and all kinds of scientists.Some I have already mentioned.There are also ornithologists, botanists, paleontologists He startled Ingrid by leaning forward unexpectedly and winking at her.Geologists.A different kind of smile creased Whisprs face.Ohhh, so thats it.Ingrid blinked at him.What is it?Her companion nodded at the desert Meld.I get it now.Our waterlogged friend here thinks were after diamonds.Diam ?Shaking her head, she turned back to the freewalker.Were going camping so we can look for wildlife.For a second time she gestured at her backpack.If my friend and I dumped everything out of our packs youd see that we dont have a single geological tool with us.Does not mean anything.When Quaffer turned slightly to one side Ingrid got a better look at the remarkable sweep of water choked flesh that clung to his back like a giant beige coelenterate.This country is full of diamonds.When the first Germans came here they were filling empty coffee cans with gems by picking them off the ground or sieving them loose out of the sand.You dont always need explosives and heavy machinery.Not if you know where to look.He turned back to her.I think maybe you two have a line on a place like that that the Germansand the British, and the Boersoverlooked.A lot of this land has yet to feel the tread of a human foot.Except for the San, maybe, and they never cared nothing for diamonds.You might have a line on an old alluvial deposit, or maybe an unmined inland sea terrace that has been hidden by shifting dunes.Small eyes burned into her own.All I know is that nobody leaves Orangemund heading north on foot because they are looking for wildlife.Whispr started to go around him.Then this will be a first for you.Come on, Ingmy friend.She moved to follow, having to skirt the bulk of the freewalker to do so.Quaffer tracked her progress but made no move to block her path.As she and Whispr lengthened their strides she could feel his eyes on her back.Calling after them, his warning words seemed to hang in the crystalline desert air.You are going into one of the worst places on the Earth!I dont care what kind of communicator or guidance instruments you have with youthe Namib eats people.Without a guide it will eat you!Turning so that he was walking backward on the perfectly flat ground, Whispr pulled his communicator and waved it at the freewalker.If we call for rescue you can be the first to say I told you so.I will say that over your bodies!Quaffers voice was beginning to fade with distance.Because if you go more than a days walk into the Sperrgebeit without a guide, the company security will find you and kill you!Even if you really are scientists!As Ingrid shouldered her pack a little higher its integrated air cushions inflated proportionately to ease the burden.Do you think thats true, Whispr?Have we only got a day before SICK, Inc.security finds us?Her companions studied reply was thick with his characteristic fatalism.If youll recall, doc, I thought this was a suicide trek from the get go.On the other hand, I also never thought wed make it this far.I feel like a rock rolling down a slope that just keeps getting steeper and steeper.Every step makes me have to go a little faster and shrinks any chance of ever going back the way I came.He shrugged.Cant go back, so gotta go forward.At least, she said as she stepped over a purposeful migration of ants, if anything does happen, you got to see your animals.Yeah.As he recalled their time in the wildlife rich Sanbona Preserve he tucked his thumbs under the straps of his backpack.He was so thin that only the built in auto stabilization feature kept it from sliding off his narrow spine.Yeah, that was something.He glanced over at her.Thanks for that, doc.Whatever happens from here on out, thanks for that.It sure was different from Savannah.Youre telling me.She returned her gaze forward.I wonder what some of my patients would say if they could see me now.Probably worry that youre taking a big chance on becoming a patient yourself.He looked back toward town.There was no sign of movement in their wake.Intensely interested in their goal though he might be, the freewalker was not following them.Already they were utterly alone in the vastness of the southern Namib.Not utterly alone, he corrected himself.Even though they were now technically intruders in the Forbidden Zone, they were no more than a communicator call away from help.The authorities in Orangemund would not refuse an emergency call from a pair of visiting Namericans.Should a life threatening situation arise, he and Ingrid could easily request assistance.Doing so would probably mean the end of their quest to learn the secrets of the mysterious metal thread she carried and they might well be prosecuted for trespass, but he doubted they risked incarceration.Especially since his companion was a doctor.He doubted the law worked any differently here than back home, where justice was a mixed salad best dressed with money.A glance to his right showed Ingrid striding along briskly, her expression determined.With her maniped red hair tucked up under her wide brimmed thermosensitive hat and her skin biosurge darkened, she ate up meter after meter of the hard ground on legs toughened from days of travel in Florida and South Africa.Her unwavering pace and resolute expression were very different from those of the pale physician whom he had first begged to remove the police traktacs from his back in an office in Savannah.He and this woman, who had acquired more education than he could ever dream of, were rolling down the same steep slope side by side.Of one thing he was by now certain: they would reach the bottom together.If only she would let him embrace her one time before the final crash.He sighed.Movement overhead caught his attention and he squinted up at a sky so stunningly sapphire that it hurt his eyes.It was a crow, an ordinary, local black and white crow.He smiled to himself.Life in the Namib was not nonexistentjust sparse.Wildlife.Whatever happened now, he had fulfilled that childhood dream and seen his share.Determining that the two figures moving slowly below it were too big to tackle, the crow moved on, a small winged silhouette set against the bowl of blue heaven.Regrettably for the scavenger, the large two legged creatures were neither dead nor dying.Yet.THE FIRST NIGHT THEY spent in the Namib would have been magical had it not been so cold.Thankful they had taken the time and the care to acquire proper camping gear before setting out from Orangemund.Ingrid huddled beneath her fold up but toasty radiant blanket and gazed up at more stars than existed outside a university astronomy text.Not even perceptible at night in brightly lit Greater Savannah, the Milky Way was not merely visible, it seemed close enough to touch.She felt she could reach up with an outstretched hand, grab a handful of stars, and sprinkle them like grated parmesan on her supper of self heating pasta concentrate.Giving the lie to the apparent emptiness, in the distance something distinctly mammalian and unhuman howled.She stifled a laugh as Whispr looked around nervously.Whats that?A wolf?From another location a second howl echoed across the barren plain.It continued; dueting tenors in a canine opera.To her surprise Ingrid found the mournful exchange exhilarating instead of frightening.I dont think there are any wolves here.Probably jackals.She shoveled in another forkful of pasta.Surely you must have done some reading about this place too, Whispr.It just looks empty, but its not.In the starlight her eyes seemed to shine.Jackals have to eat, so that means there are other creatures here besides them.I get that, he muttered.They probably survive on the corpses of stupid trekkers like us.She gazed back at him in the darkness, shaking her head.Sometimes I think your pessimism will outlive you, Whispr.Youll die but itll hang around, like a gray ghost in mourning.Until it can infect somebody else and make them as miserable as you are.Having concluded his meager meal and tossed the biodegradable container far enough into the night to ensure that any wandering ants would have easy access to it without having to go over or through him, he settled down beneath his thin blanket.Ill remind you one more time, doc: its that pessimism thats helped keep you alive.She acknowledged the truth of his observation, rose, and threw her own food container far away.The surrounding silence swallowed up the slight clatter it made as it hit the ground.Whispr tried not to stare as she stretched and, as usual, he failed.While he grew more edgy and anxious the nearer they got to their goal, Dr.Ingrid Seastrom only became more beautifuland not because of recent minor repair, replace, and regeneration maniping.She turned to look back at him.Were going to do this, Whispr.Were going to make it to Nerens, get inside, and find out what the thread is all about.Tucked beneath the blanket, he mumbled his usual misgiving.You still believe that if we get to Nerens we can get in.She regarded his prone, huddled form.Of course.Precisely because no one is supposed to be able to get to Nerens.Everyone will assume we belong there because only those who belong there are allowed to be there.Circular logic, doc.Doesnt hold up.She blinked.I didnt think you were familiar with something like circular logic, Whispr.Why would you think that?He rolled over.The ground was hard, but so were the pavements of Savannah, and he had spent plenty of nights thereon.The street overflows with circular logic.You look like a lawbreaker, so the cops pick you up.If the cops pick you up, you must be a lawbreaker.If you look like a riffler when you walk into a store, the operators assume you are a riffler and youre treated like one.He coughed lightly.I could go on, but Im tired.Sleep well, then.She settled down and cocooned herself within her own blanket.Serenaded by unseen silver backed jackals she drifted off to sleep.For a long time Whispr lay awake, unable to join her.He didnt trust the bitch burble of the four legged variety any more than he did that which originated from the two legged kind.THEY PAUSED AT LEAST once every thirty minutes to check their position on their communicators.Understandably, Morgan Ouspels route took them inland and kept them away from the single forbidden northsouth road.After several days they lost sight even of scattered 44 tracks.That did not mean the rocky, uninhabited terrain was never visited.A floater would leave no mark except where it set down.They were walking parallel to a dry wash.While Ouspels course followed the winding arroyo precisely, they saw no reason to navigate every twist and turn.Hiking beside instead of within its five meter depth allowed them to avoid the rocks and sand at the bottom while cutting off the sharper bends.Staying up top would save time and permit easier trekking.It also, however, left them exposed.Fortunately Whisprs enhanced hearing allowed him to pick up the sound before they were spotted.Down!Without waiting to see if she was following he scrambled madly down an eroded slope and into the riverbed.Dont wait, dont look aroundhide!As she hurried after him she looked around anyway, and saw nothing.WhatWhispr, I dont see ?Searcher!Get down here!By the time she reached the bottom she was moving so fast that she stumbled into him and nearly caused the both of them to fall.Though she weighed more than his attenuated form, the strength in his wiry arms allowed him to catch and stabilize her.The shock of the close physical contact momentarily unnerved him.He wanted to hold on, not to let go.He finally released her because he did not want both of them to die.Here!He gestured frantically toward a rocky overhang.Without pausing to see if the narrow opening was already occupied by scorpions or snakes he dropped to his belly onto the sand and slithered beneath the opportune cover.Though he left the most room for her, Ingrid still had to struggle to wiggle back far enough so that she would not be visible from overhead.There was no time to remove her backpack.She could feel it scraping against the rock, threatening to trap her.A minute passed, then several.The sun beat down from above.A couple of jet black, nearly spherical tok tok beetles moseyed comically along the canyon floor.The absence of sound, of even a querulous bird, was deafening.Whispr, maybe all you saw was another crow.Jammed beneath the overhanging rock, her right leg was beginning to cramp.We could take a look and Crows dont reflect light.Stay put.Though she complied with his instruction, frustration increased with each passing minute.Her leg began to throb.Ample experience had shown that her companion was more than a little prone to paranoia.Indeed, he embraced it.In the course of their journey together he had raised previous false alarms; maybe this was another.How long did he expect her to lie here, facedown in gravel and sand?Look, Whispr: if there was anything out there then its gone by now.She started to crawl forwardonly to have him grab her arm.Her glare was murderous.Let go of me right !With utter lack of ceremony he slapped his other hand over her mouth.Her eyes widened.Declarations of muffled outrage spent themselves against his splayed and none too clean palm.Then she heard it, and froze.The searcher drone was of a type she had never seen before.Those employed by the city of Greater Savannah came in several body types depending on the municipal division that operated them.Those utilized by the fire department carried small tanks of highly concentrated fire suppressant, or escape ladders, or other emergency equipment.Medical drones packed first aid kits and waldos that when operated by doctors seated at hospital control room monitors could perform emergency triage right at the site of an accident.Police searchers were armed and armored.But this one Humming softly on its repulsors it headed down the arroyo and glided directly past their hiding place.Whispr pushed his face into the sand but a fascinated Ingrid could not keep from staring.Perhaps the shadows saved them.Or maybe the drone fortuitously happened to be scanning the other side of the canyon when it passed.Coated in heavy duty flex black that helped to power it, it traveled in near silence, the only sound being the steady soft hum of its dampened engine.From the top several antennae protruded.From the sides extendedshe could not be sure they were gun barrels but she had no intention of finding out.Beneath the power paint was what she took to be armor.The searcher was not only intended to fight, it was clearly designed to withstand a first attack and offer a devastating response.In the silence she could hear her heart pounding.Its rate quickened when she felt something moving against her leg.Looking down the length of her body and seeing the snake slithering across her calves she let out an involuntary gasp.Outside their hiding place the searcher, which had moved on down the gully, suddenly paused.Hovering, it turned slowly from side to side, utilizing fixed forward scanners to search the terrain directly in front of it.It did not turn around.The snake was huge, more than four meters in length and a glossy, dark olive green hue.So dark it was almost black.Staring hard and not moving a muscle Ingrid fought to remember all she had read about this part of the world while crossing the Atlantic on the plane from Miavana.The Namib was home to a number of poisonous serpents and with its distinctive sheen this one was most likely A black mamba.The second largest venomous snake in the world.Two drops of its venom were enough to kill a person.A snake this size would pack twenty to twenty five such drops in one bite.They were aggressive and fearless.She released her bladder.Both her first aid kit and Whisprs contained doses of adaptive antivenin, but if she was bit out here by a mamba this big it was doubtful she would survive.At least, she thought as total and complete terror threatened to overwhelm her, as a physician she would be fully aware of the symptoms and effects as the poison consumed her.Turning to follow the warm curves of her body, the snake came toward her face.It had a deceptively small head, she thought.Smooth of side, wicked in outline, with bright dark eyes.As its heavy, muscular body climbed up her torso and advanced onto her left shoulder it felt as if someone were pulling a steel cable across her back.While it advanced its tongue flicked in and out just like in the nature vits she had seen while relaxing in her codo.Her wonderful, climate controlled, view enhanced, utterly civilized, snake free codo back in Savannah.She tried to will herself to that remembered distant domestic paradise, away from the lethal serpent, away from the hard, cool, pebbly ground on which she lay confronting one kind of death inside the shallow cave and an entirely different one drifting on the air of the dry ravine outside.She closed her eyes.The weight stayed a little longer, and then it was gone.She was still alive.Opening her eyes she saw the snake moving away from her.It was making a leisurely slither for the other side of the canyon.She was not the only one who noted its passing.Beside her Whispr had raised his head.He was gaping wide eyed not at the retreating reptile but at her.It took her a moment to interpret his expression.Admiration.Then they were both pushing their faces into the hard ground as the earth outside their hiding place vomited skyward.At first Ingrid thought she had been shot, only to realize that the sharp stings assailing her head and shoulders were a consequence of being struck by shattered rock and not bullets.Looking up she saw more chunks of rock falling to the ground.These were interspersed with dust, sand, and bloody fragments of the unlucky mamba.Having detected unauthorized movement behind it, the finely tuned searcher had pivoted in the air and fired its primary weapon.Analyzing the organic debris that resulted and determining that the original form was no longer a possible threat, the machine recorded the relevant information on its internal drive and broadcast it to its home docking station.Deep within the SICK, Inc.complex at Nerens, a bored security technician perfunctorily made note of the fact that Searcher Eighteen had killed a snake.All the facilitys armed searcher drones were supposed to be programmed to recognize and spare a long list of Namib wildlife, but the admonition was one that was enforced by the division only indifferently if at all.Among Chief of Security Het Krugers minions the possibility of a sudden raid by infuriated representatives of the World Wildlife Fund was not foremost among their daily concerns.As soon as the searcher had moved out of sight down the ravine Ingrid started to scramble out from beneath the stone overhang.Given the adrenaline surging through her veins the stronger but lighter Whispr was hard put to restrain her.Not yet!he hissed.Its too soon.He nodded toward the curve of the arroyo where the searcher had vanished.It might be lingering just around the first corner, or it might decide to come back and do a double check.Double check, hell!she said.Her full attention was focused on the darkness that lay at the back of the cave.What if there are more snakes in here?A sour gorge rose in her throat and she fought it down.What ifwhat if this is a den?He worked to calm her.Listen to me, doc.Ive spent time in the coast swamps.Not long ago, in fact.Theyre bolo with bad snakes.Copperheads, water moccasins, anacondas, other bad migrants from S. A.  Ive never been bit.You leave them alone, snakes will leave you alone.They dont like to waste their venom.He smiled crookedly.Kind of like cops dont like to waste bullets.Her heart rate was starting to slow to something resembling normal.How long do you think we have to hide here?His speculative gaze studied the expanse of sunlit ravine.As long as you have to hide anyplace from anything, which means longer than you think.Lets give it half an hour to be sure.Her eyes widened.Half an hour!The urine soaked right leg of her pants was beginning to itch.He looked over at her.Ill keep watch.Take a nap.She envisioned a second mamba crawling over her while she dozed.Or maybe a cobra this time.Investigating the strange, warm intruder.Her pants legs were securely tucked into her hiking boots, but still You watch the canyon, she told him.Ill watch my toes.The Sum of Her Parts     2 If they stuck to Morgan Ouspels route (and didnt run into any more patrolling searcher drones), Whispr estimated it would take them roughly two weeks to walk unhindered to the SICK facility at Nerens.The map and coordinates the renegade company employee had transferred to their communicators showed the location of small water holes where they could refill their compact water bottles.In an emergency the tightly folded collection fabrics contained in these compact devices could be unfurled and raised to extract a limited amount of moisture even from air as dry as that to be found in the interior of the Namib.As for sustenance, they had plenty of concentrates and he had departed Orangemund well equipped with the necessary supplements to ensure that his internally grafted NEM would function properly.Once they successfully infiltrated Nerens, Ingrid insisted they would find a way to access food and drink.All of this was predicated, of course, on her managing to pass herself off as an employee and him as her assistant.A long reach, he told himself as he easily kept pace with the doctor.But then this entire journey had been a long reach from the day they had left Savannah.He soothed himself with the knowledge that great rewards come from taking great risks.He continued to tell himself that as the vast treeless expanse of the Sperrgebeit stretched out before them.INGRID WAS SURE IT was all over and that they were done for when they fell on the sleeping stranger.Though Whispr was slightly in front of her he was not to blame.The fabric that collapsed beneath him boasted the exact color and texture of the last kilometer or so of ground they had crossed.The fact that it gave way under his very modest weight indicated how fragile were the supports that had been holding it up.The yelp her companion let out when he fell was followed by her own short, sharp scream as she scrambled to avoid tumbling in his wake and failed.The hoarse bark of surprise that accompanied their descent did not come from either of them.As she struggled to regain some semblance of stability, the camouflaging material in which she had become entangled was yanked away from her.Rolling to a stop, she found herself staring at the business end of a sharp nosed shovel.Beside her Whispr confronted the point of a pick.Looking up, she saw that their captor also wielded a thick, short barreled weapon that was trained in their direction.With his fourth arm he was shielding his eyes against the sudden influx of desert sun into his formerly concealed encampment.She found herself staring.Like the spines of a dinosaur, the pickarm and shovelarm protruded from the Melds shoulders.Additional muscle together with a supportive titanium weave had been grafted on to support the extra limbs.As for the pick and shovel themselves, they were not being held by additional hands.They were his additional hands.Instead of fingers, the ladled bone at the end of each melded limb had been fused and sculpted to form the two disparate excavating utensils.Each was covered with a sheath of organic Kevlar that formed a protective glove over the solid bone.Despite having seen her share of exotic melds, she had never encountered anything quite like the figure who now stood guard over them.This was, she was soon to find out, because there were no independent prospectors operating within the city limits of Greater Savannah.She grew aware that Whispr was muttering at her.Well, that shreds it.Were discovered, diced, and done.Its all over.Ill say its all over.The quadridexterous speaker shifted the muzzle of his weapon so that it was aimed directly at Whisprs face.Meanwhile the four armed Meld kept glancing anxiously at the sky.Wheres your floater?On its way already?Wont do you any good.Therell be nothing left of you but mucus after I put your bodies through the sifter!Ingrid had just enough presence of mind to stammer, Floater?We dont have a floater.What are you talking about?You gonna try an tell me the company put you out here on foot?As he tilted his head to one side Ingrid saw that his right eye had been replaced with a magnifier meld.The way the embedded lens complex caught the sun was unmistakable.The company?She exchanged a glance with Whispr before turning back to their captor.We dont have anything to do with the company.Were independent.Scientists.Were out here on our own, studying wildlife.Straight and white as salt, the Melds long hair fell to his shoulders.In the other direction, it halted long before it got anywhere near the top of his head.Then you know youre here illegally.SICK doesnt allow scientists into the Sperrgebeit unless theyre company supervised.The muzzle of the short barreled weapon came up and the shovelarm and pickarm withdrew.Both double jointed utensilized arms folded up behind their captors back as the maniped muscles supporting them relaxed.Then their owner began to laugh.Whispr let the wheezing guffaws flow unchallenged for a while before deigning it permissible to interrupt.Soyoure not gonna turn us in?Sniffling, the old Meld rubbed a filthy forefinger across his nose and flicked away something better left undescribed.Me?Turn you in?Bugs breath, I thought you were going to turn me in.Extending the hand he had just employed for suspect hygienic purposes he smiled at Whispr.Pul Barnatos my name, giving the company a finger up the ass is my game.Has been for more than thirty years.The pride in his voice was unmistakable.From the time she had first made Whisprs acquaintance Ingrid had never admired her companion more than the moment when he took that hygienically dubious hand and shook it firmly.Pleased to meet anyone whos giving a major international corporation the finger.Whispr did not provide the oldster with his name.Nor did Ingrid when, setting aside professional and personal thoughts of germs rampant on a field of bacteria, she took and shook the hand in turn.Thankfully, Barnato did not press them for further identification.As they were later to learn, it was enough for him that they were not minions of the hated company.Give me a hand.He was busy gathering up and stretching out the crumpled fabric that had failed to support his unexpected visitors.We got to get this back up before a searcher comes over.Whispr and Ingrid helped to wrestle the material back into place over their heads.Once it had been repositioned, Barnato scrambled out of the depression and fixed it back in place at the corners and along the edges.He used no metal or composite stakes or weights, she noticed.Only carefully placed rocks that would draw no attention and set off no alarms.Slipping back down into the excavation, he rejoined them.No longer fearful of being shot, picked, or shoveled, Ingrid found herself with time to examine their surroundings.Niches quarried into the walls of the depression held basic gear and simple stores.Except for a solar still whose automated tracking funnel was exposed to the sun, everything was concealed under cover.Most surprisingly, she could not see a single electronic device.The Meld had been careful to construct a subterranean dwelling that was electronically dead.In this day and age that was by itself enough to render him invisible to the senses and sensors of the outside world.You live here?She did not try to mute her disbelief.Its more a base of operations than a home.I move around a lot.Because I want to, because I need to, and because it helps me to avoid attention.He smiled again, exhibiting orthodontics that in lieu of missing or melded teeth had been replaced by two bars of solid white composite.Its worked for thirty years.I expect itll work for another thirty.But what do you do?When it came to matters of personal curiosity Whispr was a virtual stranger.Barnato gazed innocently back out of his one natural eye.Im a scientist.Im here to study wildlife.There was a pause while his guests digested this.It lasted longer than it otherwise would have because their host had delivered the reply with an absolutely straight face.Then both Namericans burst out laughing.Okay.Whispr wiped at his eyes.We get it.No more intrusive questions.He raised a hand.Promise.Its amazing to me that youve been able to live out here, in this wilderness.Ingrid was inspecting the surrounding wall niches for anything resembling modern survival gear.So far shed found nothing.She indicated the fabric that had been pulled out and stretched back above their heads.Is this all it takes?Barnato cast a squint upward.The material has the same absorption number as the ground.Searchers and satellites dont see me.When I move around its mostly at night.They use infrared, but Im careful and I know how to mask my heat signature.You can live off the land here if you know what to eat and where the water is.The San people have been doing it for thousands of years.Whispr frowned.San people?Might as well be.I try to avoid them as much as possible.Which suits them just fine, since they try to avoid everybody.Its a habit they picked up a long time ago when one of the then regional governments kept kicking them out of their homelands and trying to make them into farmers and tradesfolk.Not everybody wants to live in city or on a mechanized farm.Some folks, they like the old ways.I understand.Whispr spoke emphatically.For example, right now I wish I were enjoying the old ways back in Savannah.Sitting on the riverfront sipping an iced coffee and eating a beignet.His voice faded, growing dreamy.Actually, Ingrid told their singular host, if theres anything we can do for you in return for yourhospitalityyou just have to ask.Ignoring Whisprs increasing disquiet she added boldly, Im a doctor.I could check you for problems, maybe prescribe some remedies.A doctor.Barnato did not try to hide his incredulity.Sure you are, pretty missy.As she bridled he added, Anyway, it doesnt matter.I dont have any problems.He stretched, extending all four arms before retracting the two that were tipped with digging tools.By Societys lights I shouldnt be alive.Yet the lifestyle Ive chosen has kept me healthier than any thousand men my age you might stop at random in Lela or the canals of London.Im happy here.Its peaceful, I pay no attention to the conflicts of an overpopulated, confused world, and if I wish I can dig for pretty rocks all night long.I dont think the company would respond real well if they were aware of that, Whispr remarked.Barnato shrugged.Doesnt matter what I do.Just living here puts me in defiance of every regulation thats governed travel in the Sperrgebeit for the last two hundred years.If they find me theyll shoot me for shitting sand as soon as they would for prospecting.Have you?Whispr could not keep himself from asking.Ever found anything, I mean.Rocks.Barnato smiled.Lots of rocks.I like rocks.Okay, okay.Whispr was disappointed despite himself.I shouldve guessed.You never go down to Orangemund or Alexander Bay?Ingrid prompted their host.Barnato shook his head dolefully.Too many people.Shouting and yelling, arguing over nothing.Trying to sell stupid electronic gadgets, qwikmelds, outdated food, religion.I prefer the desert.Snakes, scorpions, lizards, insects.We understand each other.Its not all about predation out here, the way it is in town.Though sometimes I see leopards or cheetahs.Sometimes I encounter a herd of gemsbok.He licked his lips.Good eating, gemsbok.So are a lot of the local grubs.Whispr licked his lips.Youll excuse us if we dont stay for dinner, but were on kind of a schedule.Barnato turned serious.Which way you twoscientistsgoing?North.Despite their strange hosts apparent affability Ingrid saw no need to be more specific.She wasnt as nave as Whispr often seemed to think.Barnatos expression grew dour.You keep on north and company security will catch you for sure.Youll end up food for crows and vultures.Better you should turn back now and return to Orangemund.With caution and luck youll make it without being spotted or picked up.Cant do that, Whispr told him.As dedicated scientists we have no choice but to keep on until we achieve our designated objectives.Ingrids jaw dropped as she stared at him.Flush with unexpected confidence, he paid no attention to her.Weve come too far to give up on our research objectives now.Um, yes, she added quickly, weve come too far to turn back.Its never too far to turn back, Barnato told her solemnly.Return to where you came from, red missy.I have lived here for so long and yet I can barely call this place my home.Itll never be yours.Not wishing to argue, Whispr sought to change the subject.I was wondering, Meld brother, why if you decided to dwell in a place like this you didnt just go full inside out and opt for a Martian meld?Without the respiratory rework, of course.Barnato cackled softly.Couldnt afford it, for one thing.And Ive never been one to do anything half assed, which is what youre describing.His shoulders flexed and the pick and shovel bone works rose until they dented the fabric ceiling.All I wanted was to be able to dig.To prospect in the old way.Dont need any electricity to run my gear, dont need to worry about motors failing or circuits frying.Just have to get enough protein and carbs.He peered amusedly at Ingrid.Grubs are chockful of protein and carbs.If he was looking to gross her out he was picking on the wrong woman.But then, she reflected, he didnt believe that she was a doctor.The only thing that could gross out a practicing physician of her experience and skills was insufficient repayment from the government for services rendered.Why dont you spend the night?he suggested.I guarantee youll be warmer and more comfortable than up top, and you can catch me up on this and that bit of real news.Im not a hermit, you know.I just prefer living by myself.Isnt that pretty much the same thing?she pointed out.Nope.Reflections of my feelings toward todays sociocultural trends.She looked toward Whispr, who shrugged.If this Barnato meant them ill he had already had ample opportunity to demonstrate it.Unless, she thought, his intention was to get them to sleep so he could notify Nerens security and turn them in.There was probably a company reward structure in place for ratting out intruders.She shunted the thought aside.As much time as she was spending in Whisprs company it was only natural that she should pick up some of his paranoia.Barnatos dislike of the Company seemed as genuine as his disinterest in worldly goods.As the sun disappeared somewhere over the South Atlantic their host brought forth a convective containment cooker.At last, she thought: a modern accoutrement.But not one that required potentially revealing electricity.Powered by solar energy acquired during the day, it would turn all of it into heat without releasing any as radiant waste for a wandering nocturnal searcher drone to detect.Using only local ingredients including spices obtained from native plants, Barnato put together the first nonconcentrate meal the two Namericans had enjoyed since leaving Orangemund.Hewing to a pact of mutual silence, neither Ingrid nor Whispr asked what was in the bowls Barnato handed them.When they had finished, Ingrid complimented him as she handed back her dish.Not bad.In fact, very tasty.Thank you.Ive had worse, the ever diplomatic Whispr conceded.What do you use to clean your utensils?Surely not water?Actually, theres a small spring not far from here.When I want to, I can even do washing.And not just my clothes and gear.Its big enough so that I can bathe.I was wondering about that, Ingrid commented with a smile.Barnato laughed appreciatively.She had already noted that his pickhand meld had been fashioned so that the flat side lay against his back when his work arms were folded back over his shoulders.Otherwise a hearty belly laugh could have resulted in a self inflicted injury.Checking to ensure that the camouflage fabric that formed the roof over their heads was secure at the edges so that no light would leak out, he brought out a small coldcandle and rubbed it to life.Settling himself in a low slung folding chair, his gaze roved from one guest to the other.
