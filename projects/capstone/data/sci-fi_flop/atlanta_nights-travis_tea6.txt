There were a  dozen    three jelly, four glazed, two strawb   erries frosted, three peanut butter, and  Yvonne's favorite, a coconut glazed."Would you like a cream filled?"Callie pounded the table."Damn!"she  cursed."Why does everything happen to  me!"she exclaimed.She dropped her robe on      the floor."I never get a break!"she  hissed.Yvonne felt really badly!She had know n Callie for years, since the summer of  '91 when a cloud the shape of a ball of dus  t opened the sky to the heavens and turned  their life into one big fun time.It was late in the evening and Callie was wearing a bright  green skirt and matching red top with pink lace  at the neck and sleeves.It had a slight  paisley pattern that caught the sun.It wa  s before Bruce's accident.Though he would  never say so, Rory Edwards thought she was   the most beautiful woman he'd seen.He  often wished that Callie wasn't married, or that Bruce was dead or something!The night was magical, and the band played disco into the night."Are you doing something with Rory?"she asked, deciding to take the bull by the  horns and get to the root of the situation and let the chips fall as they may."I refuse to answer that," Callie said pigheadedly."I don't have to answer that!"This was a fine how de do!"After a ll we've done together, you all won't tell me  what you're doing!"she cried loudly."O, for crying out loud, Yvonne!"Callie    shouted back like a bellowing mule,  "What do you think?What does it look like?""Is Rory here?"Yvonne sobbed."He left. "Callie informed her.She we nt to the refrigerator and opened a can of  Diet Pepsi."He ...he couldn't perform. ""Yes," agreed Yvonne."He often has that problem. ""What!You, too!"Callie blurted.This  was a big surprise!What in the world  was Callie thinking?!Rory was always afraid this could happe n.   Despite his macho exterior, he was a  bundle of fears inside, an writhing masse     s of phobias that made him tremble in  nervousness.If he knew what the two girl  s were saying about him right now, his ears  would probably burn red hot!Or hotter!Callie sat on the red leather couch that Rory  had picked up on sale in Sears at the  Peachtree Mall.She suddenly felt like a fool !How could she not have guessed?The  signs were all there, the skim milk instead of 2%, the sudden change in Rory's manor, the  time he spent "working" at the office."Pepsi?"offered Yvonne, sensing her pain  and offering her can.She had had her  share of bad love affairs, like that hands ome doctor with the office on Peachtree Street who dumped her when she had hinted that sh  e wanted more from the relationship than  donuts.Suddenly, the box of doughnuts depressed   her.She wanted to drown in their  rich, creamy taste, become for gotten in their sweet crunch that reminded her of the death  of Arky.It was even worse with the weightlifter.Callie took the peace offering gratefully."I'm not a bad person," she pointed out,  drawing her robe around her."I'm just cursed. "Suddenly, there was someone at the door!Callie could tell by the sound of the  corduroys that it was her husband, Bruce!What a predicament!If Bruce found out about  this, its being all over!"What should we do?"fretted Callie, her  eyes beseeching her longtime friend.It  was a scary situation!Callie didn't want Br uce to know, but after the accident, he had  become different."Yvonne, but I need your help!"she begged.Yvonne felt sorry for her friend Callie, who had such beautiful glossy black hair."Rory," called Bruce, lisping slightly."Have you seen my hard drive?I'm a  software developer, you know. ""We need to do something!"Callie whispered."Bruce doesn't know about Rory!"It was scary!If Bruce found out, there  was no telling what he might do!He was  insanely jealous, given to furious rages at the drop of a hat!"What should we do?"Callie asked?We need to do something!Yvonne thought about it.The needed to do something!But what could they do?Bruce hadn't been the same since the accident .It was all so hopeless!Yvonne should  have known better than to bring the donuts; Bruce was sure to blame her!Suddenly, she had an idea!"Go into the bedroom!"she urged Callie."I have an idea!""An idea?"asked Callie.She had ideas   of her own, dreams of beautiful winter  knights in Tallahassee, Georgia, watching the    ships come in from the sea.With a  handsome man by her side, his strong many arms mannishly comforting her with his  male strength.She dreamed that idea many nights, but when she woke up, the arms were  gone and she was in a stone cold bed with no   joy except for her tropical fish.Dead all  these many years."I should go into the bedroom," Callie opined.She picked the robe up off the  floor and did so."This had better work," Yvonne muttered as she opened the door that could mean  a matter of life or death!Atlanta was a hot city that day, and the  air conditioner was dribbling and leaving  a pool on the floor.Too bad it wasnt helping to keep the station house cool.I hate  summer in Atlanta, Andrew Venice thought.Hed give anything to be hanging around  up north some where  anywhere so long as it  wasnt 90 degrees in the shade and full of  concrete.He had half way convinced himself to go down to the cantina and get a cold tall  one when someone shouted at him.Hey Andy, you got a visitor!Andrew raised his bleary eyes from the mass of papers on his desk.It had been a  long day, and in spite of all his efforts to dig up everything he could on this case, he was  still no closer to figuring out who has killed  Henry Archer than he had been when they found Archer dead.The scattering of evidence wasnt producing any clues that he could  use.Suffice to say, he was not a happy camper just now and it was playing Old Harry  with his temper.The last thing he wanted  was a visitor.Probably some wino coming in  to report seeing pink elephants in the alleyways of Atlanta.The city was full of crazy  drunks, and most of them ended up at the police station at one time or another.Of course, being a detective, Andrew didnt usually have to put up with them.The desk officer at the door was usually   the one who was inundated with drunks and  floosies and every other whacko in the street.Im just the murder guy...Who is it, Sergeant?Andrew growled.He hated interruptions, especially when  he had not had enough sleep.Hed been up all night staring at the photos of Archers  body.It had been too hot to go to sleep last  night.Even sleeping in his underwear had  not been comfortable.He would have stripped naked, but old lady Carson in the flat  across the way was already on her last pace maker.No use in giving the old girl a kick   off before her time, though she would have gone with a smile on her prune face.The Sergeant merely stepped aside, pulling his police hat off his head and holding  it in both hands.His cheeks had a sort of a  pple glow.He turned his eyes to look just  down the hall, and he smiled.Well?Andrew barked.A woman with a head full of hair as re    d as a roaring fire stepped through the  doorway.She had green eyes like the rich emeralds in a princess crown and they settled  on Andrew the way a fox looks at a chicken  thats strayed from the hen house.Hungry  but hesitant, and wary in case there was  a dog nearby.He puffed his chest and stood up, enjoying the way her eyes rode up and       down his well built frame.Clearly, she  appreciated how well set up he was.In    turn, he stared unabashed at her voluptuous  figure clad in a short tight black leather sk  irt and pink frilly blouse open nearly to the  navel.He put her about thirty five, though she might have been able to pass for younger.Hi there, she said in her thick Southe rn drawl.Are you Andrew Venice?she  asked.I might be, Andrew said.Whos asking?She sauntered into the room, walked over  to the chair before his desk and seated  herself demurely without even being asked.The angle gave Andrew a better look at her  cleavage.He was starting to feel warm.My name is Yvonne Perrin, and Im a friend of Callie Archer, she said.Callie Archer?Henry Archers wife?Andrew dropped into his chair and  started pushing papers aside in search of the report of Callie Archer.Widow, actually.Yvonne smiled, and A ndrew knew then that she was too hot  of a woman to be handling in the summer.Those green eyes were starting to mesmerize  him.He cleared his throat roughly.So...what can I do for you?Venice said, trying to keep his mind on his work.Well, you see, I heard on the TV that the police were asking that if anyone knew  anything about the Archer case to please co me forward.She pushed a hand through her  thick red tresses, brushing them out of   her green eyes.So I thought I should come  forward and tell you what I know.And just what do you know?Andrew asked.For a moment, Yvonne glanced over her shoul der.Then she looked back at him  and leaned so she was braced on the far side of his desk.Im not the sort of girl who rats on her friends, mind you.Callie and I go back a  few years.Shes always been like a big sister to me, if you know what I mean.Yeah, I know, Archer said.And youll probably think Im terrible for  telling you this.She looked at her  hands.I make that decision after you tell me, Archer said.Yvonne pursed her luscious lips.Well, as I said, Callie and I go back a ways...to  when she was Callie Lucent.Before she married Henry.She tells me everything...well,  almost everything.Anyway, I knew her olde     r brother Bruce too.Hes over at the  hospital right now recovering from an automobile accident.I though I would drop in and  visit him...just to make him feel better.Callie  said he was sorta blue.But he was asleep  when I got there, and I didnt want to wake him up, but I didnt know what to do.I was going to leave when I decided to  use that little bathroom in his room, and  while I was in there, I heard people coming into the room.I was going to call out and let  them know I was in there, but I heard Callie...and I heard Dr.Nance.Dr.Nance?Andrew asked.Arthur Nance.Yvonne waived her  hand around in the air as though shoeing  flies.Hes some big time doctor over ther  e.   Anyway, I heard Callie say, Is he still  asleep, and Dr.Nance said, Oh, yeah, hes going to be out for a while...She paused.And?Andrew insisted.It got quiet, and I opened the door...and Callie was kissing Dr.Nance like he was  an old flame.Andrew frowned.So what did you do?Well, I didnt want them to know I was in there, and that I heard them and saw  them, so I sorta slipped out of the room and left.She cocked her head like a little girl  afraid of being scolded.Was that wrong of me?I just didnt want to embarrass them...Just like that?Andrew asked.They didnt see you leave?Yvonne shook her head so the cascades of   red hair shimmered like flames in a  fireplace.God, he wished it was winter...I was real quiet, she said.Anyway, thats what I know.Its what I saw.And just why are you telling me this now?Because...it was back before Henry di ed...and it made me wonder if he knew  Callie might actually be having an affair w ith the doctor who was looking after her older  brother.Andrew sighed.Well, I want to thank you for coming in and telling me this, he  said as he stood up.Yvonne pulled herself out of the chair and nodded.Thanks for letting me tell you, she said.Its a load off my mind, and can sure  tell you.If you think of anything else, Andrew said.Give me a call.I will, she said and smiled.Bye, now.She sauntered back out of the office just as Sergeant was returning.Sergeant  pulled off his hat again and nodded to her as she passed.Then he took his hat and started  to fan himself while smiling at Andrew.Now thats what I call one hot little lady, the Sergeant said.I wish I was a few  years younger, I do.Are you gonna ask her out?Dont be ridiculous, Andrew snarled a nd motioned the Sergeant to leave.Still  grinning like a hyena, the Sergeant wandered aw ay.Then Andrew sat down and started  staring at his papers.So Arthur Nance and Callie Archer have a past, Andrew muttered.That was something to ponder.Irene Stevens nibbled at her sauted crab cake (it was nestled in a mild golden  curry sauce and garnished with micro basil) , and gazed at Bruce Lucent, who was sitting  at the head of the 42 seat table with his  wife, that positively ancient Callie Archer with  her glossy raven hair (that had to be Miss   Clairol or Irene wasn't the reigning Georgia  Peach Princess for 2003!)and her gravity defying 38DD boobs.Bruce (who had the  studliest body ever, but a face like a turn ip, round and a little purple around the bottom  where his skin was still recovering from the laser peel to get rid of those nasty acne scars)  was in a midst of a long, boring presenta     tion about his newest software package,  LuceLips, an interactive speech recognition pr ogram that could do everything from read  you're morning newspaper to you to book you're lunch reservation.At this point in the long presentation (too too long, as far as Irene was concerned),  chef Joel himself clapped his hand to  his mouth in amazement."You mean a  computer  reserved my special Cellar Room for this   function?"the handsome and dashing chef  gasped, smiling broadly, and everyone set down their salad forks and applauded with  appropriate little oohs and ahhs and titters of  appreciation.It was enough to make a girl  gag."How's the crab cake?"Rory Edwards asked.Rory Edwards, sixty (but he didn't look  a day over forty, not with that absolute  hard body!), was Irene's bestand at the moment onlyfriend in the whole sunny state  of Georgia.She just didn't understand why other girls didn't like her.All the men she met  did.In answer, Irene popped a bite of the crab cake into her mouth and gave a little  shivering moan of ecstasy.That little shiv er made her ample bosom quiver on an even  larger scale, causing the computer geek across from her to nearly poke himself in the  cheek with his fork.Now there was a man  who could stand some buzzing with a laser!That unibrow simply had to go, and that tattoo,  UNIX Rulz!was just too icky for words.Especially on his neck.Imagine having to look at that every single day of you're life!"It's delish," Irene simpered."Thanks so much for bringing me, Roar. "Rory Edwards's tanned cheeks turned pink  in response to her use of her pet name  for him, "Roar," and he took off his spectacles and polished them feverishly, something  he always did, Irene noticed archly, whenever she paid him a compliment.He looked  pretty darn good for sixty, thought Irene.She' d always thought golf  was an even bigger  bore than computers, but Rory Edwards was living proof positive the sport had something going for it.Either that or Rory   was sinking his considerable fortune into  liposuction and face lifts.Bruce Lucent aimed the laser pointer he was holding at the giant screen and said,  "Next slide, please," in his slightly boyish   (but not in a bad   kind of way) voice, but  instead of the silver and black Lucent banner, an error screen popped up.At the same moment, a woman's sultry       voice issued from the speakers, "Oh,  Bruce, darling, I'm afraid something's gone terribly wrong. "The raven haired beauty sitting beside Bruce made a wide eyed moue of  astonishment and shook her magnificent mane of  raven hair."Why, Bruce, darling ...!"she cried, smiling widely, her teeth like snowy Chickens and her lips like glossy red satin  pillows, and pointed to the computer to make  sure even the dumbest of the dumb got the  joke."That's my voice!"Irene stifled the urge to roll her eyes and  stick her finger down her throat and pantomime  a person throwing up.Oh, as if ...!She thought.Could any of this be any more fake?Bruce cleared his throat and frowned in  mock displeasure.He tipped his head on  one side, stroking his rugged chin with his   long fingers, fingers that looked as if they  really knew how to pleasure a woman, Irene  thought dreamily.She squirmed a little in  her chair, entertaining racy fantasies about what she'd like to do with a studly body like  Bruce Lucent's.Bruce opened his voice to give a command, but before Bruce could speak  the computer voice that was exactly the same as Callie Lucent's voice asked in a husky  drawl that sounded like she'd been positively  gargling straight tequila, "What can I do to make it up to you?"It sounded, Irene thought with  uncharacteristic lack of charity, as if  Callie Lucent's computer voice was asking if Bruce wanted a blow job.Stabbing ferociously at her crab cake,    Irene pretended for a moment that the  golden sauced crustacean cake was Callie's face.Her oh so perfect Baptist face, clear of  wrinkles, clear of unsightly hairs, clear of   pimples.The arrogant woman.Irene's hand  crept to her chin to surreptitiously fondle the hard red zit that was swelling under her  creamy skin.It was the kind of zit that  hovered under the surface for days, not really  showing but feeling, if you touched it, which Irene did  about a zillion times a day, to see  whether it was forming a head or not.Sometimes Irene hated being a mere twenty two,  even if it did mean she could go braless without worrying she'd look like she was  carrying two droopy water balloons under her trendy Donna Karan tank top.She had  firm, upright breasts, the left just a teensy   tiny big bigger than the first, something her  doctor told her not to worry about.It just made them more kissable, he'd assured her as  he pleasured her atop the examining table,    her feet in the stirrups, his hand over her  mouth to stop her unstoppable little cries of ecstasy.Irene's nostrils flared with delicate disdain as she glared at Callie Archer's ample  bosom.There was more silicon floating in that woman's chest than there was in the  laptop computer Bruce Lucent was showing off  this very minute to the two men at the  table.Irene wondered momentarily who they   were, and if they were as well to do as  Bruce.One of them (Irene could tell she was a computer geek from the fact he was  wearing a Star Trek T shirt under his sports jacket, a jacket so old and tatty it had shiny  elbows, and blue jeans from Gap.There wa s even a plastic strip running down the leg  that said "38 38 38 38" all the way down to  his calf) was engrossed in whatever was on the screen.The other, a young redheaded man with ginger freckles and a studly body but  a really ugly face and the worst teeth Irene had ever seen on a man, was ogling the five or  six acres of cleavage Callie Lucent was displaying.Irene sniffed.That any woman over  forty would dare wear a Betsey Johnson, especially in a high end upper class place like  Joel's, positively reeking of good taste, was just unthinkable.All she needed to complete  the ensemble, Irene thought with uncharacteristic  sarcasm, was a pair of castanets and a  guitar player shouting "Ole!"That made her smile, and she dabbed her   glossy lips delicately with her napkin  (good thing she'd remembered to use her new Clinique "Stay the Day" lipstick!)before  once more putting her attention back on her   crab cake.Swirling a forkful in the mild  golden curry sauce, she took a bite.It really   was scrumptious, but if she ate the whole  thing, and the pt de chocolat served with crme fraiche sorbet and a rolled sugar wafer  cookie she'd been eyeing on the menu (or maybe the delicious sounding   crme caramel  with honey vanilla ice cream and a sweet almond wafer cookiethey both sounded    so  good!), and a couple more glasses of this positively yummy 1999 Marsannay   ros from  Domaine B.  Clair in Burgundy, France, she'd either have to skip dinner tonight or march  right into the washroom and throw it up.Suddenly, just like he was right there across the table from her, his laugh lines  deep as the Grand Canyon and his merry eyes  twinkling like stars, Irene could hear her  dearly departed and oh so deeply missed d ead lover Henry Archer's gruff down home  rumble: If'n ya'll are gonna just upchuck it the  second y'all finish eatin' it, Reeny bean,  what's the gol dang point of spendin' this kind of cash on lunch?Her china blue eyes welled with tears.Oh, Daddy Hank ...!she thought.(He  wasn't really like her real daddy, but since he'd been so much older than she was and took  care of her better than her real daddy ever did, never hitting herexcept when they  played "Spanky Pants"and never forcing her to do anything she didn't honestly truly  want toexcept when they played "Rape Me  Till I Squeal!"or maybe sometimes when  they played "Good Till the Last Drop," which r eally wasn't her favorite game, to tell the  honest truthand never, ever calling her horrible cruel names like "Daddy's Little Blow   Up Dolly. ")How could you leave me like that,    my sweet Daddy Hank, without even  saying goodbye to you're darling Reeny Bean?It had been six months, but not a day  went by that she didn't miss her darling "daddy. "It was, in fact, why she was sitting here  in swanky Joel's restaurant: today was their first anniversary.Well, it would have been their first anniversary, that is, if Henry Archer hadn't  been so tragically killed in that tragic car  accident out on the Parkway.Could it really be  six months since he'd been killed so tragi cally?It seemed like only yesterday they were  snuggling on his big round king size bed or ki  ssing in his kidney shaped pool or just  holding hands like a pair of giddy freshmen away at college.That was Daddy Hank had still been marri     ed to that positively vulpine Callie  Archer then"vulpine" was Irene's "New Word of the Day," one of the many self   improvement things Irene was doing to improve  herself so she could rise up above the  red dirt poor country style life she'd grown up inbut she obviously wasn't satisfying  him, not like a  real woman could.Not like I could , thought Irene, tossing her glorious  mane of flaxen hair in vexation.There wa  s no one in the world she hated more than Callie Archer, who used to be married to  Daddy Hank before he met Irene and found out  what true love really was.Daddy Hank had promised  to leave his wife for Irenehe'd  even started the divorce proceedingsbut then he 'd died so tragically in that tragic car  accident, before he could change his will, before he could divorce Callie, before he could  marry his beloved Reeny Bean and make an honest woman out of her.And then, to add insults to injury, to make matters worseas if they could ever  get any worse!the straw that broke the   camel's back was when Callie turned around  and married Bruce Lucent just a week, a  week!after poor Daddy Hank died.Callie  inherited everything, and Irene was left practically penniless.Callie even cancelled the  lease on that cute little Lexus coupe Daddy Hank had given Irene, the merciless,  heartless, cruel witch.It was enough to make  Daddy Hank turn over in his graveif he  had a grave, that was, but he didn't, being  cremated, after all, since Callie was too cheap  to buy a plot and casket and cement liner.She'd had him stuffed into the cheapest  cardboard box the funeral home had, and then  mailed the box to Irene.Postage due.The  arrogant woman.If only there was a way I could make     her pay, Irene thought, fiercely fighting  back the tears that welled to her lovely ch  ina blue eyes.If only there was something, I  could take away from her ...!Bruce Lucent was finished his part of the presentation, nodding and smiling at the  applause.As his technical assistant took   over explaining the technical parts of the  software, Bruce put his hand on Callie's s houlder and murmured, "Back in a sec, hon. "Then he headed out of the 42 seat private Chef's Room, which was just off the kitchen.It had beautiful art, high ceilings, and state of t he art technology available to rent, which is  probably why Bruce Lucent chose it for his software presentation.And suddenlylike she'd been struck  by lightninga light  bulb went off over  Irene's pretty head.Once more patting her glossy lips (and tucking her Clinique "Stay the  Day!"lipstick in the pocket of the chic  little Versace number she'd carefully picked out  that morning, knowing it accentuated her vol uptuous perfect size 6 body), Irene slid out  of her chair and leaned close to Rory to  confide, "Just going to powder my nose, Roar.Order me the  pt de chocolat served with  crme fraiche sorbet and a rolled sugar wafer  cookie, will you?"She had a feeling she'd be hungry when she got back.* * *         Steven Suffern eyed the voluptuous young bl onde as she left the room, her round  ass looking like a juicy Georgia peach in that sexy little number she was wearing.Steven,  a masseuse at Atlanta's Polo Club, had an eye  for the ladies, but he liked to bat for both  teams.In fact, he had his eye on the studly older guy she'd been sitting withSteven had  asked around and found out quite a bit about   Rory Edwards, who was sixty but didn't  look a day over forty.One was that the hard  body was just as good without the clothes  no corset for Mr.Edwards!and the other wa      s that Rory Edwards was loaded, rich,  rolling in the dough.And unattached.The "unattached" part was the one Steven was hoping to personally change, and  hopefully by this afternoon, suppertime maybe, or this evening at the latest.He'd scored a ticket to the $200 a plate luncheon presentation by giving an extra special massage to fat  old Mrs.Decatur.He'd never be able to watch the movie      Deliverance again without  thinking fondly on the moment.He'd known there would be dozens of fat, rich pigeons at  a do like this; no reason he couldn't pluck   one.And Mr.Rory Edwards was the perfect  pigeon.Steven had seen the way his eyes       , a lovely chocolate brown behind his  spectacles, had kept roving his way.He might have a chubby for the luscious blonde, but  put a bat in his hands, and he'd nail one out of the park.Steven rose, unconsciously checking his ha ndsome visage in the mirror for errant  flecks of micro basil (he'd had the crab cak es) and made his way over to Rory Edwards."Mind if I sit down and chat for a moment?"he asked, his pleasant baritone warm and  inviting.He put out his hand and offered a  manly squeeze, which Rory Edwards returned  withequal fervor."Uh, er, my companion will return shortly ...Edwards stammered.Steven slid his hand under the table, expe rtly flicking the snowy linen tablecloth  over Edwards's lap to cover the fact that hi s nimble fingers were even now sliding down  the zipper of Edwards's expensive Ralph Laur en stain repellant slacks."Don't sweat it,  handsome," he murmured with a throaty gr owl that made perspiration beads pop out on  Edwards's surprised face."This won't take long ...* * *         Irene smoothed the skirt of her natty little Versace number over her curvy hips,  smiling a secret smile to herself as she re e  ntered the 42 seat private dining room.She  was a little out of breath, and if truths are told, her "Stay the Day!"lipstick hadn't quite  held up to it's advertised promise of lasting through everything, but otherwise, no one would guess that she'd just moments before  been riding Bruce Lucent like a champion  bucking bronc rider at a Texas rodeo, his face buried between her firm, high breasts that  bounce unfettered and free.There was a young man sitting in Irene's seat, but he jumped to his feet the  moment he saw Irene, giving her a smile that  showed off his perfect white teeth.He had  the most startlingly green eyes, like a cat's, an  emerald color that showed off his golden  tan and sculpted features.Irene's own China blue eyes strayed down to his crotch, noting  withexpert quickness that he dressed le ft and was hung like a stallion.She licked her  lips, smiling as she lifted her hungry eyes off  his crotch.Surely she'd worked off enough  calories with Bruce that she could have her two desserts, after all."You'd never guess what I've been doing,  Roar," Irene confided, sure the young  man couldn't hear her (not realizing that   he could indeed, and was hanging on every  word)."I've just given Bruce Lucent the ride of his life!"Irene laughed merrily, her laugh like a do zen little tinkling bells, and tossed her  magnificent mane of flaxen hair."I followed him into the men's room," she said in a  purring voice."Caught he with his pants down, so to speak!"Rory Edwards just blinked at her, his mouth open a little.Irene laughed again,  gaily, enjoying the effect she was having.This  would certainly get him in the mood for  what she had planned later this afternoon!"I pretended I didn't know I was in the men's and got all flustered and excited,"  Irene said."So excited, my breasts just  popped out of the top of my Versace!These darn  criss cross tops just don't hold  anything in!And as soon as he saw my bobbiesthat's  what Daddy Hank liked to call themwell, Roar, he just about popped, too!"Irene's pretty face was flushed as she ex  citedly recounted the tale of what had  happened in the men's room: "I said to him,  'Ooo, Mr.President, I've always wanted to  try one of those big cigars ...!Can I have just a teensy little taste?'Roar, I thought his  eyes were going to fall right out of his head  he was staring so hard, and he couldn't say a  word, just kept making these funny little noise s like a puppy on his mama's teat, so I just  went to my knees and went to work. "Rory Edwards groped in his pocket for his handkerchief and mopped his sweating  face.It was a rather violent red, Irene no ticed, but she was having too much fun telling  her story to bother asking if he was feeling all right."He pulled me to my feet," Irene said,      her China blue eyes sparkling at the  memory of how manly Bruce had been, "and he picked me up and set me on the imported  Italian marble counter top, and pulled my panties down with his teeth!And oh, Roar, he  pleasured me with his probing tongue and nimble  fingers ...!Just when I thought I had  reached the utmost peak of bliss, he thrust his throbbing member deep inside my hot little  juicy love box, and pounded me like a snorting stallion on a broody marewell, except  that a stallion would have had her doggy style, or horsey style, I guess you'd have to say,  taking her roughly and manfully from behi nd, but Bruce mounted me from the front  until I shrieked so loudly and with such unsurpassed abandon that he had to put his hand  over my mouth to stifle my cries of ecstasy as he filled me with his steaming love juices!Oh, Roar ...!I've never felt such bliss, such ecstasy, such rapture, such elation, such"         Irene stopped, suddenly aware that Rory  Edwards' eyes had stopped blinking.His  hand clutching his handkerchief had fallen to  his lap, pushing aside the tablecloth that  had, until that fateful moment, been covering the fact that his fly was down and his rather large and still a tumescent member was fully exposed and his Ralph Laurens' stain free  slacks hadn't lived up to their reputation.Rory Edwards, in fact, had stopped together .His heart, at least.Strained to it's  very limit's from Steven Suffern's expert  ministrations, it had been pushed beyond the  very limit's of human endurance by listening to  Irene's spirited and passionate exposition  of her washroom conquest of software developer Bruce Lucent.Irene's lovely China blue eyes filled with  horror and flew to Steven Suffern, who  was standing stock still and frozen with u  tter shock behind them.Then she began to  scream, loud and long, even louder than she' d shrieked while being pleasured by Bruce  Lucent.But this time, no one moved to put   his hand over her glossy lips and stop her  anguished cries.Like an ululating sire n, klaxoning on and on and on and on and on, she  kept it up for a full twenty three piercing mi  nutes until the police arrived and a craggy  officer finally slapped her to shut her the hell up.The doorbell rang and Irene looked up from   the magazine article she had been  reading over and over again for the last half   an hour.She would not have been able to  tell anyone, not even her best friend Abbey O' Neil, what the article was about.Oh, she  could have guessed of course, and said the  article was about women's fashion, the latest  rage in New York, jodhpurs or henna hand        tattoos, but she would have just been  guessing.The article was just chicken scratch that her usually well tuned mind could not  comprehend.Her thoughts were of nothing at     all, nothing but the death of her lover  Henry Archer.Never again would their bodies glide together in union.Never again would she be  able to run her fingers along his ample      muscles.Never again would he kiss her  voluptuous breasts or caress her beautiful blonde hair.Death was the cruelest break up of  all.The doorbell rang again and Irene came back  from her thoughts of Henry.It was  all she had left of Henry.That and the apartment.The mink was also hers.He had been giving to her, and she to him where she c ould.Very giving.But then Henry had been so  handsome.Her best friend, green eyed, slender Abbey had laughed at the idea of twenty   year old, blue eyed, blonde haired Irene dati ng a sixty year old, until she had seen his  ripped pecs and bulging biceps on the trip to  the Cayman Island Henry had arrange for  the three of them and Henry's friend Rory   Edwards.Henry spent an hour in the gym  every day.His pecs, abs, and biceps were to die for.But no longer.Henry was in the ground, dead  from the car crash that took his life  and that of his Mercedes.Both were bl ackened hulks now, one buried in the ground of  exclusive Peach Barrow Cemetery, the other in a police impound lot.She would miss that  Mercedes.The doorbell rang a third time and Irene stood.She placed the magazine on the  end table in its place next to the previous month's issue.All things in their place in Irene's  living room.All things in their place.Her heels clicked on the marble of the f  oyer.She paused in front of the gold   edged mirror.Her level, blue eyed stare  answered her look.Her shoulder length blonde  hair was pulled back into a tight bun, the same  style she had worn to Henry's funeral.A  thigh length black skirt covered her volupt  uous chest and buttocks.Below the perfect  hem of the dress, her legs reached exactly  to the floor.The three inch heels accentuated  the bulge of her calf.The mirror had no   doubt she was a beautiful, strong woman.Nor  would any man have doubted it, nor many wome n, at least those women so inclined to  appreciate a perfect female body.Irene knew many who did.Abbey for one.Checking her eyes one last time for a ny redness, she pulled open the door, and  said in her contralto voice, "Yes, may I help you?"Andrew Venice had heard many contralto  voices before, but none attached to a  woman as beautiful as the one standing befo re him right then.Blue eyed, blonde haired,  and round in all the right places, Irene Stevens, the mistress of the burnt and blackened  millionaire industrialist and ex body builder Henr y Archer, was a sight that sent a shiver  down his rock solid, forty year old body.What  that now blackened old geezer had seen  in this twenty year old beauty was clear.What she had seen in him was his money.Andrew Venice knew her type well.He  saw them on Peach Bottom Avenue, the  ladies of the night who came out to offer   their nylon  and fishnet covered wares.Irene  Stevens was the same, but her price was hi  gher when she could get it.Looking at the  well filled skirt she wore, Andrew Venice expect ed that she would fetch that price for a  long time to come.Until the Botox stopped wo  rking and the force of gravity could no  longer be fought."Hello, I'm Andrew Venice, police detectiv e," he said in his deep voice."We met  briefly at your...friend Henry Archer's funeral. "Irene knew what Andrew Venice was thinking, that she was a high priced whore,  a woman of the night.She was, but it was a velvet night with champagne stars."I know who you are, and I know what you' re thinking," Irene said."But you're  wrong where it counts most. ""I bet I am.May I come in, Miss Stevens. ""Do I have a choice?"she asked, stepping aside."We all have choices, Miss Stevens. "Irene led the buff police detective into the living room."What do you want with me during my time of grief?""Answers, Miss Stevens.Answers to some questions. ""Ask your questions, Police Detective. "Sh e sat on the sofa and crossed her legs  slowly.The slide of nylon on nylon was the rasp of a thousand tiny saws."I'll come straight to the point.We know Henry Archer was murdered. "Irene stood, her hand over her left breast."Murdered?How do you know?"The act was good, Andrew thought.Very   good indeed.Andrew could almost  believe the shock was real."Forensics, Miss Stevens.Forensics. ""Oh, forensics. "The police detective was watching her closely.He'd meant to  startle her, to scare her.Perhaps he suspected her.The thought scared her and excited her  at the same time.Her, Irene Stevens, a suspect in the murder of Henry Archer."The brakes on his car had been tampered with, Miss Stevens. "The thought of Henry stamping uselessly  on the German made break pedal of his  Mercedes over and over again to no avail sent a shiver down Irene's spine.Her stomach  clenched at the thought of Henry's last frantic moments.She hoped that his last desperate  thoughts were of her.Surely he had not been thinking of his wife Callie."How horrid!""Indeed.But I face the horrid every day, Miss Stevens. ""How do you do it?""With a strong stomach and a thousand push ups every morning. "Irene could see the cut of Andrew Ve  nice's body even through the dark suit he  were.For a police detective, the suit's quality  seemed out of place, Italian, if she guessed  right.The bulge at his side was not just from the gun in its holster.Andrew continued, "Someone with access to the car, someone close to him,  someone who knew German cars, someone who perhaps spent a year in school in Munich  and took auto shop there, tampered with the breaks on his car causing it to carom out of  control on Peach Valley Road on that fateful night. ""I went to school in Germany!I took auto shop!""I know. ""But   but  "         "I know quite a bit about you, Miss Stev ens.I know you are    I mean, were,     Henry Archer's mistress.I know you were one of the last people to see him alive. ""But when my father was stationed in   Germany, we studied the C230 in auto  class.Henry drove an E series. ""Not hard for a dedicated murderer to figure out, Miss Stevens. ""I did not murder Henry!""Then who did, Miss Stevens?Tell me and I'll go easy on you. ""I know nothing about it. ""A day after Henry's death, you were seen  coming out of Rory Edward's house. "It was a lie.Andrew Venice didn't like saying it,  but Irene Stevens was a nut that he had  to crack one way or another, and he didn'  t mind using all his bastard police detective  techniques to do it."I   I   Rory's a friend.A friend of both Henry and I.  He was comforting me.Rory  even went with us to the   "         "Cayman Islands.Yes, I know that too,"   Andrew Venice said with satisfaction."Do you know what Archer and Edwards were doing in the Caymans, Miss Stevens. ""Yes, of course.We were spending tim  e on the beach.And in the evening we  went dancing. "It had been an absolutely w onderful time, three days of sun and fun with  her best friend and her best man.She had wo  rn a red bikini that was a size too small.Abbey had been jealous and Henry had been wild about it.The perfect vacation."And in the mornings he and Edwards visited their bankers to deposit large sums  of cash. ""I slept in.I wouldn't know. ""Don't lie to me!Tell me what you know      of Rory Edwards and his business  venture with Henry Archer!""I don't know anything, I tell you!
