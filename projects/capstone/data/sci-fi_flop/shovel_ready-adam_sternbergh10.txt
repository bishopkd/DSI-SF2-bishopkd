What do you want from me?I want you to come home.Why would I do that?Because its where you belong.They stroll a golden path together through the garden in the courtyard, enfolded in birdsong and blossoms.An impossible breeze, originating nowhere, ripples the emerald grass.Blades sway.But you hurt me.I punished you.Im your father.Thats what fathers do.They punish.Because they love you.No matter what youve done.I thought that was Gods job.Which part?The punishment.And the love.Father.God.At some point, Grace, were really saying the same thing.They only tapped Rachel out because someone had heard about her.Requested her.Her reactions were said to be extraordinarilywhats the word.Nuanced.She was suddenly in high demand.An out of state donor wanted a test drive.Called and talked to Harrow personally.Harrow explained he would arrange to tap in the donor and put Rachel at his disposal.But the donor wanted to meet her.Just for a moment.Out here.In the flesh.Call me old fashioned, hed said.Harrow outlined the risks of bringing someone back.Of bringing her back.If she spoke a word of what shed seen to anyone.The donor reminded Harrow that he had been habitually generous to Crystal Corral.Then he offered to up the donation.Treble it.He was one of Harrows closest associates.The Deacons Circle, Harrow called them.They had a special room, special black paycards, special beds.Special requests.So, against his better judgment, Harrow agreed.Arranged the meeting.Set a time.Had Rachel tapped out and sent to the infirmary.Under medication.Under restraints.Under watch.But the donors private jet was delayed an hour on the tarmac.Stranded by a sudden thunderstorm.Just long enough for Rachel to get word out to Grace.Plane grounded.Donor fuming.Storm pounding.The bright sky furious.A violent squall that just seemed to blow up out of nowhere.Act of God, all the weathermen said.The vault stands open.The door is three feet thick.Inside, a high end bed.In the bed, a body.Wears a suit, like hes been dressed for the occasion by an undertaker.Silky white hair in a halo around his pale skull.Gauges gauge.Monitors beep.Respirator hisses.Milgram dismisses the nurse with a nod.She leaves to linger just outside the vault doorway.We stand around the bed, me, Milgram, and the farmboy.Three wise men at the manger.Harrows body seems deflated.Each breath an awful rasp.So delicate looking I feel like he might crumble if you touched him.He is an old man, after all.Made older by all his dreaming.In Chinatown, needles wobble.A steady beep becomes a frantic SOS.Margo frowns.I dont like this.We should wake him up.Mina waves her off.If you do, shell be left in there alone.Shes in there alone now.And from what Ive heard about her, I get the feeling she can take care of herself.No.Not in there.Mark jerks.We have to wake him.We cant.Do it.I said I cant.Why not?I have to find him first.The three other farmboys slowly drift within spitting distance of the open vault.Just to remind me theyre there.The frisky farmboy stands guard inside the doorway.Looks impatient for the breaking things to start.He shoots a glance at Milgram.Milgram sends back a tight little smile, like a telegram that reads, Youll get your turn.Stop.I make small talk.So wheres your friend?The Magician?Simon?Hes in there too.Wheres his bed?Hes in a separate location.Security protocol.Pastor Harrow never goes off body unescorted.Thats not what we talked about.She wanted to meet with her father alone.This is just a formality.Dont worry.Theyll all be back soon.How close is she?Bodily, I mean?Shes close.And you have people with her?To bring her here?Yes.And dont forget the motorman.No, of course not.You see, Mr Spademan?There are other ways to resolve things that dont involve spilling blood.Sure.Or, at least not ours.Right?He squints.Nods.Tries to laugh like hes in on the joke.A reaction he must have seen somewhere and sporadically tries to re create.Grace, you remember Simon.Simon joins them on the golden path.Hadnt been there a moment before.Now you dont see him, now you do.Harrow turns to her and grips her shoulders, like hes sending her off on a dangerous but necessary journey.Im so glad to have you back, Grace.But actions have consequences, my love.Simon slips behind her.Grabs her arms from behind.Her father consoles her.Just remember, nothing that happens in here can hurt you.Not really.Not in heaven.No matter how real it may seem.Harrow seems to pause for a second, as though searching for a thought, the addled mind of an old man, not what it used to be, but thats not it at all, in fact hes only shifting his weight slightly, and curling his gnarled wounded bird of a hand into an even more gnarled fist, which he sends with all his heaven assisted fury into the soft center of Graces babyswollen belly.She cries out.A cry that carries across pastures, statues, fountains.A cry seeded, like a storm cloud, with sobs.Harrow leans in to whisper.Sweet intimacy in her ear.Dont worry.Hes fine.Then straightens himself.Laurel wreath askew.I have a strong feeling its a he.Uncurls his hand.Grace, why did you think you could hide him from me?For whatsoever you have, I gave unto you.And whatsoever I gave, I can take away.So sayeth the Lord.No Bible verse she ever learned.He nods to Simon.Now, Im going to leave you two alone for awhile.Her short sobs betray her.She struggles to swallow them.Dad, wait.Dont.Wait.Dad, dont you remember the story of the Prodigal Daughter?The story you taught me when I was a girl?How she returns home and all is forgiven?Oh Grace.Of course I do.But you know me.Ive always been more of an Old Testament man at heart.I ask Milgram, because Im genuinely curious.You ever go off body?Visit heaven?That you created?Me?No.Unlike many people, I still feel that theres value in the physical world.That it is a blessing to have a body.I believe thats as God intended it.Me too.To retreat to some dream, its wickedness.A temptation.To embrace the spectral world.And the people who flock to itwell, they seek easy escapes.Its a weakness.Pastor Harrow doesnt see it that way, of course.But to me, bodies are glorious.To be alive is glorious.That is the gift from God.To turn your back on that Yes, its true.Bodies are glorious.I check my watch.Milgram frowns.Do you have somewhere to be?No.Just something to do.He glances at the farmboy, who takes a half step toward me.I ignore him.Stare down Milgram.Ive always had one question about bodies though.A question for God, I guess.Really?What is that?Perhaps I can help you.Why exactly did He make them so fragile?Go easy on her, Simon.She is my daughter, after all.Simon steps around her, then turns sharply to Harrow, like a soldier about to salute.Reaches up with both hands and grabs Harrows face.Kisses him on the cheek.Then steps back and snaps his fingers.Presto.A silver coin.A trick.Simon shows it to Harrow.Then palms it.Snaps again.Another coin.He holds them both out, one in each palm.Then brings his hands together.Shakes them.Coins rattle.Reproduce.He opens his hands to show Harrow the bounty.Thirty silver pieces in all.So heres the thing about a box cutter blade.You can take it out of the box cutter.The blade itself is very thin, like a razor blade, only longer.And its flat enough to, say, tape to the inside of your forearm.Or on your chest, under your shirt, over your heart.Frisk proof.I work on the farmboy first.The frisky one.Nothing lethal.Just something quick.And distracting.While hes on his knees trying to keep whats left of his eyes from dribbling out onto the floor, I pull the vault door closed.Its a heavy fucker.Tug of war, and Im the anchor.Beat the other farmboys by a half step.They pound with their pistols.Gunshots muffled on the other side.I give the kneeling farmboy a last meaningful slice across the throat, and he slumps like a split bag of garbage, spilling its wet load onto the floor.Now its just me and Milgram.Minas white bandage throbs in the light of the laptop like a neon cross at night.She searches.She searches.She searches.She smiles.Fucking finally.Oaken doors creak and Mark rushes in and up the path like hes late for a party.A centurion head in each hand.Like luggage.Chucks the heads in the underbrush.Okay, first of all?Piggybacking is bullshit.Pardon my language.Brushes his hands off.Stands shirtless.Golden curls.White raiment swaddling his loins.Gladiator sandals with straps wrapped to the knees.Simon smiles.Harrows face ashen.Mark looks himself up and down.What?Too gay?Rolls his shoulders like hes prepping for a prize fight.Bounces.Flexes his back.Spreads the I RULE tattoo.Letters reassemble.URIEL.Thats better.Boxes the air.A one two jab.Now, if youll excuse me one moment.He bends double.Grunts.Stands erect.Grunts again.Fists clenched.Then roars.Wings unfurl.I know what you did.Milgram stands steady.Still smiling that unconvincing smile.I am blameless in Gods sight.None but He can judge me.That may well be so.I step toward him.He smiles.Sweats.So what are you going to do?I think you know.What?Kill me, and thenlive in this vault forever?There are three armed men out there, waiting for you, and what do you have?A razor blade?Its a box cutter.You know you cant get out of here alive, not without me.I pause.He eyes me.Spots weakness.Crack of daylight.Heads straight for it.Im telling you, you do this, and we both die.I stroke my chin, then take my chin stroking hand and grab the back of his head.Yank him toward me.For the first time, he squeals.I whisper.Fair enough.You first.I work on his throat, nothing fancy.But with gusto.Like ripping at a Christmas gift you cant wait to get open.Were alone in the vault so theres no rush.When I let him go he falls to his knees.Penitent.Having seen the light.And the dying of the light.His windpipe whistling.Exit music.He plays himself offstage.Harrow calls for someone to tap him out.No ones listening.Simon stands by, arms crossed, like a guy at a bus stop waiting for the crosstown express.Waiting for the inevitable to play out.Mark hovers.Persephone holds out a knife in a stained leather sheath.Asks her father.Do you remember this?Yes.I gave it to you.Thats right.For what purpose?To protect yourself.Right again.But from what?The evils of this world.Yes.And they are many, Grace Chastity.They are many.And I did my best to prepare you.Yes.They are many.And to protect you.I tried to.And to teach you to protect yourself.Yes.But I didnt do a very good job of that, did I?Not when it counted.I only wanted the best for you.When you cried, I comforted you.When you faltered, I picked you up.When you strayed, I corrected your path.Thats all.Yes.And you taught me to protect myself.I hope so.And my baby.I have a baby to protect now too.I can harbor you both.She slides the knife from the sheath.No, I think I can do this.Checks her watch.I think Ive learned all I need to learn.I stand alone in the vault.Me, and two bodies.Three, counting Harrow.His sandpaper breath.Still oblivious.The box cutter blade is too slow for my purposes.And, by now, too dull.I check under the bed.Find a gym bag, tucked out of sight.As I was told to expect.To be honest, Im kind of surprised.Unzip.Check the contents.A handgun.A hammer.A spike.A second spike, for the heart, as a failsafe.All accounted for.Six inch railroad spikes.Further sharpened.One thing left to do.Check my watch.Grace Chastity, I raised you from a little girl.I know.I remember.I was there.Look around you.I can offer you everything.All I see here is a frightened old man.Im not frightened, Grace Chastity.I am saddened.To see what you have become.Yes.Im a little saddened myself.These cheap theatrics dont suit you, Grace Chastity.And despite what you might think, all of this?Its just for show.You cant hurt me in here, dont you understand that?You cannot hurt me.You foolish, stupid little girl.Anything you do in here has no meaning in the actual world.And when I find you there, I will reap this pain on you a thousandfold.All right.You know I can do it, Grace Chastity.Yes.I do.Checks her watch.Its true I cant hurt you in here.Not really.Watch beeps.But I can give you something to remember me by.My watch beeps and I hammer the spike in.It takes fewer blows than I would have thought.Id etched a cross in his forehead with the box cutter beforehand.As a target.Then held the spike steady.Waiting for my cue.Just two blows.Straight through.Fragile.Like I said.In the dream, Harrow gasps, shocked, a sharp intake, less in pain than in simple surprise.Then he smiles.Even looks a little embarrassed.The emperor dethroned.Glances down at his chest, where shes still twisting.Blood spreading in a swallowing stain.This is the moment he will live in forever.Looped.Like a record skipping.His knife.Her hand.His heart.Its an old bank, but the vault was retrofitted more recently, the security precautions updated after an employee got locked in overnight.I search for the emergency release.Luckily I knew about all this beforehand.A little bird told me.After all, theres really no reason to try and stop people from breaking out of your vault.I find the lever and pull it, and shove the door open slowly, and since theyre expecting a guy frisked clean with nothing but a razor blade, I get off five clean shots before they even return fire.Guns.They do have their uses sometimes.Three shots hit, two with authority.And the last farmboy standing has lousy aim.Lucky.When he falls I distribute the last half of the magazine more or less equally between them.For closure.The nurse has, for some reason, stuck around.Shes paralyzed in a corner until I wave her toward the exit.Crepe soles soundless on the marble floor.Until she hits the puddle.Keeps running.Tracks blood right out onto Wall Street.I start searching the extra rooms for Simons bed.Mark lands lightly, looking slightly disappointed.You hardly needed me.Of course, theres still him.Simon, prepping his exit.Im sorry, but I really have to run.Mark steps up.You and I started a conversation earlier, back at that country church.We should finish it.Simon straightens.Happy to.Persephone grabs Marks arm.Dont.Simon smiles.Looks her over.Good to see you.You look well.She wipes her blade on her dress.Bloodies the flowers.Just tell us which way.Simon looks to Mark.Back to her.Then points.She says to Simon: Okay.Now go.Fast.I mean it.Then she gestures to Mark.Follow me.I find Simons bed in the old bank managers office, but no Simon.Now you see him, now you dont.Too bad, because I have that second spike.I do find another room though.Six beds.Six old men.All tapped in.All dreaming.Arranged in the round.Deacons Circle.She leads Mark to a different doorway, hidden behind creeping ivy.When they first walk through, they actually do hear harps.Harps, then the screaming.The far off hopeless cries of the long since damned.The room is pitch black, with only flickering flames to light it.They wait in the doorway, their eyes straining against the dark.Their pupils dilate, hungry to let the light in.Then regret it.For Mark, the only reference is paintings.Blake.Bosch.But alive.Persephone recalls something different.A young woman stabbing herself in a hospital bed.Persephone speaks first.Ill need something.Mark hands her the hurlbat.She hefts it, one handed.What about you?I keep something handy for special occasions.In his hands, suddenly, a sword aflame.Uriel.In the Bible, the flaming sword is mentioned only once.Held in the hands of the angel Uriel who banished Adam and Eve from Eden.Some scholars read the flaming sword as a metaphor for lightning.Mark is somewhat more literal minded.Persephone lit white by the heatless fire.Wait, how come you get the flaming sword?Dont forget, I taught Sunday school.And I have a good imagination.She heads right.He heads left.Cut their way back toward each other, like explorers clearing brush.I watch the deacons sleeping.Leave them undisturbed.Head outside to the bank steps.Greet Wall Street.Fresh air.Bright sun.Wolf whistle.Eight mangy stragglers assemble.Still way too many dreadlocks.Remind myself to institute a shaved heads only policy.For now, though, let them work off some of the anger that built up back in the park, over a week of siege and beatings.Resentment toward society and so on.Pass out six box cutters.One per deacon.Point the way inside.Outside the barn, crickets chatter.Inside, a nurse flips through a magazine.Someone in a bed murmurs.Awakes.Bolts upright.A scream.Then another.The nurse puts down her magazine.At Paved With Gold, in every bed, someones gasping.Awakened.Eyes blinking like a newborn.Born again.35.The citys quiet.I leave Persephone, Mark, and the Mangy Eight at my place and take my boat across the river.Its the first truly cold day of the season and theres a flake or two in the air, with winter creeping up the river to tap the city on the shoulder.I dock in Tribeca, walk east among the castles, rough cobblestones underfoot.These ones arent made of gold, just cobble.Brought over in the bellies of empty cargo ships as ballast, then unpacked here and used to pave a new world.In Chinatown the first of the last remaining shops roll up their iron shutters and open.Id helped the Mangy Eight ditch their bloody clothes and took care of the Deacons and the farmboys and Dave the doorman too.Remember, I used to work as a garbageman.I have access to incineration.Id say ashes to ashes but that never made sense to me.None of us start out as ash.In any case, those gents are all now traveling the city as weightless tourists, floating birds eye over the streets, burnt to soot flecks and swirling on the fresh gusts heralding winter.May well land by accident on somebodys outstretched tongue.Reverse snowflake.This city does leave a taste in your mouth.I head into a knock off emporium on Canal Street and pull out whats left of my nest egg.Thanks to recent developments, my slush fund is all slush, no fund.Still, I have just enough for a Chinatown shopping spree, to outfit my new naked brood back home.I hand over the last few bills.Prodo for everyone.As Im walking out, my phone rings.Unknown number.Though I know.Hello Simon.Id never told anyone about that place, the Social Club in Hoboken, not Mark, not Rick, not anyone, so imagine my surprise that morning when Simon the Magician pulled out the chair opposite mine.Made me an offer.Laid his cellphone on the table.Trust me.Shell pick up.Hello Simon.Well, Id say that went off without a hitch.Almost.Id really hoped to find you in that bank.Give you a proper good bye.I thought you might.But I had to jet.Some other time, perhaps.Spit crackle of a bad connection.I blink first.You got your money.So whats next?I wait.Manage the crisis.Then fill the void.No, I mean whats next for her.Ill make sure shes taken care of.And how are you planning to do that?Well, for starters, I have you.Whatever arrangement you have with her is between the two of you.But lets be clear.If I ever see you Dont worry.I dont intend to be involved.At least not right away.And I almost hung up then and there.I should have.But it gnawed.So I said it.One last thing, Simon.Yes?Congratulations.He laughs.That laugh.So she told you.Not until this morning.Secrets are so hard to keep.Its a wonder they even call them secrets.Though I guess this one would have come out eventually.So to speak.Listen, Spademan Good bye Simon.He starts to say something else but before I hear it I pull out the SIM card and drop the handset in the sewer.Hear his laughing voice echoing all the way down as he tumbles to the underworld.It wasnt Harrow.It wasnt her boyfriend.It was Simon.Simon the Magician.Head of Security.Harrow never knew.Harrow would have killed them both if he had, of course.Killed all three of themman, woman, and child.Probably killed some other people besides, just for being in the same vicinity.Harrow had appointed Simon to be personally responsible for his eldest daughters security.His job was to watch her.So he watched her.One day, she watched him back.It was a short affair with only one lasting consequence.A secret with an expiry date.Or, rather, a due date.Shed caught me on my way out this morning.Everyone else in the house still asleep.Led me by the hand to a bench by the waterfront.The baby wasnt the reason she ran.I was right about that, she said.She actually thought that maybe she could stay.In her home.With her family.With her father.That somehow hed understand.Before shed thought that.Before Rachel.But not after.She cried as she told me this.Shed gone to Simon first.Spilled everything.About her father, about the farm, about Rachel.About what theyd done to her.Hoped Simon would help her.Hoped together they could halt it.Turned out he knew all along.Winter wind in a rush up the Hudson.Hugged her knees to her belly on the bench.Watching the water.A posture of protection.Belly getting bigger every day.Im sorry I lied.I was scared Its okay first of you.Then of my father.And I knew Id need helpIts okay.He had plenty of sins to atone for.to stop him.Once I knew.I had to stop him.I didnt know how.Its okay.And then Simon Tugged her close.Its okay.And when I said it that last time, I think she finally started to believe me.It all made sense now, of course.Simons intercession.The Judas betrayal.But when I shook his hand in the Social Club, I didnt know any of this, and I cant change that, or deny it.It was a deal with the devil and I took it.Figured thats what passes for hope these days.But maybe Im wrong.I hope I am.She and I sat for a bit by the river.On the Jersey side.Witnessed the sun resurrect itself over the Hudson.Rising up from its nightly tomb.That daily miracle.The once mighty skyline cast in shadow as a consequence.36.All the cemeteries have long since filled up.No one gets to be buried anymore.Government mandate.Last thing we all have in common.Rich, poor, sleeper, servant, preacher, heretic.Everyone goes in the fire.Except Harrow.Id wanted to take Harrows body along with the others to the incinerator but Persephone wouldnt allow it.Turns out Harrow has a family plot in a churchyard in Vermont.Bought a generation ago, next to nine dead generations before that, long before the Harrow clan pulled up the stakes of their revival tents and headed south to build a crystal church.Burial plot.The last luxury item on Earth.The plot of ground hed bought by plundering peoples souls.Persephone insisted.Cant say I understood but it wasnt mine to understand.So we rented a U Haul van, backed it up to the bank steps, and packed Harrows long body in a cardboard box.The kind that cheap beds come in.Body length.Rick had a million of those lying around.Still, Harrow was tall.His shoes stuck out the end.We slid him in, closed the van doors, and drove all night to Vermont.Me, her, Mark.Her in the back with the box.Moonlit night.Vermont churchyard.Once you get out of the city, you can see so many stars.Nine generations of Harrows lay side by side, under stone markers.Number Ten in a cardboard box.Number Eleven stood by the graveside, weeping.Number Twelve asleep in her womb.We didnt bother with paperwork.Just showed up with a shovel and a body.Work in the light of the highbeams.I dig the hole.Spadework.Mark says a prayer.I wish I could recount it, but I dont remember it exactly.Something about our souls, in this world and the next.Then we lift the box together.Aim for the fresh scar wed just cut in the earth.Harrow always said that he hoped to build a heaven.We send him six feet in the opposite direction.
