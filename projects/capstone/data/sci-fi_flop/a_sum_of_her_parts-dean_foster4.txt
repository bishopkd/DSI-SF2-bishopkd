As she stared, another struck him in one fold of his ridged forehead.Reaching up, he plucked it free and gaped at it with a confusion of shock and wonderment.His eyes rose; searching, scanning.Another of the green needles penetrated the left one, just below the pupil.Screaming and clawing at his face, he stumbled backward and tripped over the body beneath him.She was grateful that he landed nearby and not on top of her.As he rolled in pain and dug desperately at his punctured cornea a hail of pale green needles peppered his body.Water began to seep from his back sac where they pierced the aqueous manip.Soon he stopped screaming and stopped digging.More moments passed before he stopped for the last time.As Ingrid lay on the ground breathing hard, a small scrabbling noise drew her attention away from the body of the guide.Squinting against the still rising sun she was able to make out shapes gathering along the upper edge of the ravine.More and more appeared until there were several dozen of the upright figures staring silently downward.Each carried a hollow reed that had been strengthened with treatment from vegetable resins and a quiver full of needles slung across its back.A few wore small pouches slung over one shoulder or the other.Their hair ranged from brown to gray and on to white, but their eyes were universally black.None stood much taller than the other.None stood much taller than a foot.She was dreaming, Ingrid told herself.That had to be it.There was no other reasonable explanation.On the other hand their tormentor was dead.The freewalker Quaffer lay nearby within arms length, motionless and studded with green needles.Moments ago he had been alive and delivering very real threats.Now he was unmoving and harmless.The indisputable cause of his condition stood lining the rim of the ravine and staring down at her.A glance showed that Whispr was equally mesmerized.But despite the belligerent guides evident demise her friend was not as sanguine about their prospects as was his companion.The creatures had killed Quaffer.They could with minimal effort kill him and his equally helpless companion.They began to chitter among themselves.Then one that was slightly bigger than his companions descended into the arroyo.Small clawed feet effortlessly found footholds where a human would simply have fallen back to the bottom.As it approached Ingrid she lay perfectly still, not wanting to do anything to alarm it.Not that she could do much with her hands bound behind her and her ankles locked together by plastic strips.The slender mammal performed a quick circumnavigation of the doctor, staring and sniffing, while its companions watched intently from above.Scrambling up onto her chest it rose up on its hind legs and stood as comfortably as any biped while it studied her face.The black nose at the tip of its long snout quivered.When it yawned she had a glimpse of small but very sharp teeth.Whispr could stand it no longer.What is it?His gaze swept the line of armed figures that dominated the rim of the little canyon, their eyes intent on the two bound shapes below.There were more than thirty of them now, each grasping a minature blowgun.What are these things?Her attention fixed on the face of the furry being standing on her chest, Ingrid swallowed before replying.Ive seen nature vits of them.I think theyre meerkats.A response was immediately forthcomingbut not from any source she would have anticipated.It arose in the form of an intelligible squeaking from the enchanting lightweight whose strong supportive tail was presently aligned with her cleavage.Each word was enunciated with the painstaking care reflective of the effort that had gone into forming it.At the same time sunlight glinted off the bits of crudely clipped nanocable that emerged from the back of the diminutive speakers skull.The trailing wires imparted a faintly Rastafarian look.Yesmeerkat.The Sum of Her Parts     6 They can talk!So flabbergasted was Whispr that for a moment he forgot he was bound and incapable of more than the slightest movement.Talking weaselshere!The subject of his amazement turned to look at him.Why nothere?The tiny paw not clutching the blowgun gestured upward.I, called Nyala, can talk.Other friendscannot.Hopping down off Ingrids chest the meerkat landed on all fours and scurried over to the mountainous body of the big freewalker.As she trotted across the sandy bottom of the ravine Ingrid could see that the quiver on her back was filled with more of the minute needles that feathered the corpse.Approaching with caution, the creature who called herself Nyala sniffed gingerly of the body.Jumping onto the chest she quickly explored the dead guides length from ribbed forehead to booted feet.Coming back around the torso she paused beside an open hand, opened her jaws, and sank needlelike teeth into the extended thumb.Whispr winced as blood leaked.The test was conclusive.Quaffer was not faking.Returning to Ingrids side the meerkat leader looked up and let loose a stream of chatter.Immediately the flanks of the gully filled with members of her mob who easily handled walls so sheer that they would have defeated any humans efforts to climb out.Swarming over Whispr and Ingrid they began chewing carefully and energetically.While a fascinated Ingrid observed the frenetic activity in silence, it moved her companion to be considerably more vocal.Thats itget the ones on my ankleshey, thats a finger, not a strap !Within moments they found themselves free to sit up.While the rest of the mob retreated to a safe distance the meerkat who called herself Nyala remained close to Ingrid, watching as the human rubbed her wrists to restore circulation.Blood flowing once again and their nemesis from Orangemund reduced to a harmless mass of dead flesh off to one side, she found herself in solemn conversation with the desert dwelling mammal.The meerkats habit of standing on two legs while propping itself up with its tail gave it the incongruous appearance of a small, sunken eyed, sharp snouted primate.Recollection of her elemental zoology reminded her that it was not a primate but a member of the mongoose family.She did not wonder at its ability to speak: only at its comparative fluency.Plainly, it had been expertly magified.Animal magification was a long established analog of human melding.Though it was only supposed to be applied to fully domesticated animals or those that had been specifically bred for the purpose, exotic animorph pets were widely available on the black market.Parrots that could sing as well as speak were all but ubiquitous.Cats that could respond to verbal commands with purring answers were a perennial holiday gift.Even some of the higher reptiles like the iguana responded well to advanced magification.And of course everyone knew of the famous and long established Ciudad Simiano Reserva in Central America that was home to the descendants of true primates who had been illegally magified so that they possessed actual intelligence.But the mongoose was no primate.Yet it displayed an intelligence level on a par with several of the old world monkeys.Ingrid continued to rub at her left wrist.Why did you come to our aid?Where have you come from?Howhow are you able to speak with intelligence?Many questions.Leaning back on her tail, Nyala checked the condition of her mob before replying.Must go slow.Thinking makeshead hurt.Whispr let out a grunt.Never thought Id have something in common with a weasel.Theyre not weasels, Whispr, an irritated Ingrid corrected him.Theyre mongooses.Ill tell you what they are.Sitting on the sand he turned to face the nearest line of dark eyed saviors.The movement caused a couple of blowguns to be raised part way in his direction.Theyre damn welcome, thats what they are.He eyed his left wrist.I didnt think anything had teeth sharp enough to bite through a restraint band.Swiveling on his skinny backside he directed his gaze at the meerkat standing beside Ingrid.Why did you help us out, furball?On the verge of responding, Nyala was momentarily distracted by the appearance of a small beetle that was attempting to make its way between her and the female human.Dropping to all fours she darted directly at it, snapped it up in her jaws, chewed briefly, and swallowed.Neither Ingrid nor Whispr was unsettled by the display.With the advent of worldwide food shortages, insects and their kin had become a major protein source for humankind.In a turnabout from thousands of years of history locust swarms were now looked forward to with eager anticipation by large segments of the planets population.Having finished her unexpected snack, the meerkat Nyala explained.Comefrom Bethlehem.Their pint sized rescuers were not through delivering shocks, Ingrid realized.I cant believe that.Bethlehem?All this way?You crossed the whole continent?And if you came from there why do you speak general English and not ?Having responded more judiciously to the claim, Whispr had crawled to his pack and extracted his communicator.To conserve its remaining power, in lieu of an energy hungry projection he opted to study the small screen directly.When he found what he was looking for, he interrupted.They may be smart, he explained, but theyre not super weasels.They cant defy distance.Turns out theres a Bethlehem in South Africa.Lifting his eyes from the device he gazed admiringly at the row of curious faces staring back at him.Still, it must have been a helluva hike from there to here.Nyala gestured at her companions.Some run, some steal ride on machines.Namib our home, ever.Taken as infant cubs were we.Raised and She struggled to form the words for which she was searching, finally surrendered and settled for a single one.It was more than adequately expressive.Experiment, she finished helplessly.Ingrid nodded understandingly.It was just such illegal intelligence enhancing gengineering that had produced the ancestors of the apes of Ciudad Simiano.Nyalas limited ability to speak and think proved that such prohibited research was still being carried out.She gestured diplomatically in the direction of the alert and watchful mob that was arraigned around their leader.Bored by the hard to understand human chatter, a couple of them were taking tentative nibbles of the dead Quaffers fingers.But the others cant talk?Proving that she had absorbed more than just minimal speech, Nyala responded with a negative shake of her head.All can think.Some experiments more effective than others.Some others Her little voice trailed away.Ingrid kept very quiet.Then the meerkat straightened.Others not have successful layrightlarynx manip.Only me.In a gesture Ingrid found inexpressibly touching, the meerkat tilted her head forward until she could place a small black paw between her ears.One other thing also make difference.Experiment people say Igenius.Whispr nodded understandingly.So because of that this, uh, tribe, they chose you to be their leader?Meerkat mob leader always a female, she snapped back at him.I chosen because I best to help others survive.Not because can think far and speak human.This is Namib home.More useful here is meerkat chatter than human growling.I could almost agree with you, Ingrid murmured fervently.You still havent said why you helped us.Remember me being many times tied.Remember fighting back.Remember beinghurt.Dropping to all fours Nyala padded over to Ingrid, stood up, and put a paw on the back of the doctors hand.It was tiny and soft.Small bright black eyes stared deep into Ingrids own.Tying against will is wrong.She glanced toward the lump of the freewalkers body.Hurt others is wrong.Andis important for species survival dominant females stick together.Ingrid found herself starting to choke up.Whispr was encumbered by no such emotional upwelling.Dominant fem ?He shrugged.Whatever.Raising a hand, he pointed toward Quaffers body.Im guessing you punctured the subgrub with about fifty or sixty of those little needles.Even though the biggest of them is only maybe a couple of centimeters long, the freewalker dropped like a friend of mine who once ohdeed on redruzz.Slipping her paw off Ingrids hand Nyala turned toward the male human.Needles are Codon spines dipped in scorpion venom.Meerkats eat scorpions.Poison isstrong, but we are immune.Whispr was nodding.Okay.Now I know why he went down.Maybe you could let us have a few of those spines?Theyd come in real useful in a close quarter fight and No!Nyala dropped to all fours and scurried away from him.Humans have enough things to hurt already.She looked back up at Ingrid.We make mistake in saving you?Nono, you didnt, and were more grateful than we can say.Ingrid glared across at her companion.Perceptive enough to realize that he had stepped on some very small toes, this time Whispr offered no comment.My friendits just that there are so many dangers out here in the Namib and he likes to be prepared for anything.Standing up, Nyala indicated the freewalkers carcass.That is worst kind danger anywhere everyplace, and Namib is mostly safe from it.You stay in Namib, you avoid that kind worst danger.Ingrid smiled appreciatively.If thats an invitation, thank you.But we cant stay.We have things to do.Places to go.Death to meet, Whispr muttered, breaking his brief silence.Ingrid glared at him again, but Nyala was not disturbed.We all have death to meet.Meerkat by cobra or leopard or jackal or bird.Human by gun or bomb or evil words.I prefer some day be taken by eagle.Is honest death and one creature feed another.When humans kill each other, no animal benefits from itnot even humans.You are wasters of the world.Ingrid felt compelled to demur.I recycle religiously.Other things.Not self.Only artificial doings, to make yourself feel better.Nyala turned and barked something to her mob.We will help you.We claim kill.As the two travelers looked on, the mob swarmed over Quaffers body and bent to work digging into a raised spot on one side of the soft ravine bed.Sand flew high and far enough to force Ingrid and Whispr to turn their heads away and shield their eyes with their hands.Occasional quick glimpses revealed what the meerkats were up to: they were preparing to bury the body.Thisthis isnt necessary, Ingrid told Nyala.The desert scavengers will take care of him.We desert scavengers, too, the meerkat leader informed her.Werecycle.Not for meat, but for bodys water.All fluid precious here.Ingrid had a vision of a dozen meerkats taking bites out of the sand covered corpses back and lapping up the outflow from the fleshy maniped water sac.The image rendered Nyala and her companions somewhat less cuddly.I give you gift of participating.You may share, the meerkat declared.Thanks.Ingrid smiled wanly.We have water with us, we know the location of the water holes ahead of us, and in an emergency we have devices that can pull water from the air.Nyala stared at her.The energy being displayed by her mob was truly prodigious.Already Quaffer was disappearing beneath a blizzard of expertly flung sand and soil.So much smart.So much stupid.Turning away from the human, the meerkat matron scampered over to the guides corpse to supervise the final bits of the ongoing burial.Normally, Nyala told Ingrid as evening descended, meerkats obtained all the moisture they need from the assortment of snakes, lizards, insects, arachnids, and the occasional small bird they consumed.But when other liquids became accessible they did not hesitate to avail themselves of the source.The stored water that flowed from the maniped back of the dead freewalker must have struck them as surprising as the flash flood did the two human visitors days earlier.Having sipped from the fleshy storage sac of the nearly buried guide until their bellies bulged, they sprawled themselves out on the sand like so many miniature intoxicated guards.As it grew darker the only sound in the sheltered ravine was the occasional lap lap of a tiny tongue, like a butterfly tap dancing, as another of the mob took one last drink of the precious fluid that was of no further use to the intruding desert Meld.Normally Whispr tried to sleep as close to his companion as she would allow.Not this night.Finding semi shelter beneath a partial overhang he rolled himself up in his blanket with his back pressed tightly against the rock wall.Though he was loathe to admit it, while the weasels or mongooses or rats or whatever they were had undeniably saved them from Quaffers single minded madness, he was more than a little mistrustful of the sharp toothed little vampires.Anything that could bite through a restraint band could bite through a neck.The meerkats partial demolition and rapid interment of the freewalker had done nothing to mitigate his wariness.So he lay awake watching for the unheralded approach of small eyes in the darkness.The only advantage their eerie bipedal presence conferred was that he was so busy keeping an eye on them that he forgot all about the possible presence of far more noxious natives such as scorpions and dancing white lady spiders.Perhaps navely, perhaps out of empathy, Ingrid felt no such concerns.In the lonely vastness of the Namib where the only human beings they had encountered since leaving Orangemund were a half mad hermit and an even madder diamond hunter, the magified meerkats seemed more human than any of their recent contacts.While only the leader of the mob could speak, all of them were imbued with a depth of compassion that arose from having been ripped from their homes and families and transported to a far off research facility where their brains and nervous systems could be experimented upon for the ultimate amusement of other mammals boasting bigger bodies and smaller souls.Where they made Whispr nervous, they fostered in Ingrid Seastrom only empathy and curiosity.The former was the doctor in her, the latter the scientist.What will you do now?she asked Nyala by the glow of a small portable light.Standing in its shadows, the leader of the mob was picking her teeth with an unpoisoned Codon spine.What we have done since returning here from Bethlehem.Raise our families, play, eat, survive.What our kind has always done.Youre not afraid those who were experimenting on you illegally will try to track you down and take you back?Nyala let out a rapid chittering sound.It might have been meerkat laughter.None of us embedded.No trackers planted in us.There wasno need.We could not escape.And if we escape, where we go?Certainly not all way back here.Not all way backto the Namib.Her tone grew darker.It be easier for them collect innocent lives of others to destroy.Lying wrapped in her blanket, her head resting on one hand, Ingrid studied the dominant female.Doesnt that bother you?Meerkats not like humans, Nyala told her.We fight all time.For territory, for hunting rights, for best burrow digging places.Sounds like humans to me, Whispr called out from his chosen sanctuary on the other side of the gully.Nyala ignored him.What happen to other meerkats not concern me.Only my mob concern me.My mob and my children.Pass on genes.Ingrid considered thoughtfully.I thought we were more alike than that, you and I.  Warm blood not everything.In the most humanlike pose she had displayed since first putting in an appearance in the ravine, Nyala put her right paw over her heart.What here is everything.She looked around.Not good be caught out at night outside burrow.Too many eaters of meerkat.Id think the presence of Whispr and myself would make anything smaller than a leopard hesitant to come close.Yes, is true.Nyala nodded agreement.Human stink frighten off most everything.No burrows here.I go find patch of warm sand.I wish no moon to you, woman.My name is Ingrid.In gred.Yes, Ingred.You sleep.Always good have nice sleep before sunrise.Maybe sun bring food, maybe sex, maybe fight.Maybe death.THE HEAT WOKE HER.Something was wrong.Constantly adjusting to both the ambient external temperature and that of her body, the biothermosensitive blanket was supposed to keep her comfortable even in extreme conditions.Blinking in the darkness, as her eyes adjusted to the starlight she quickly saw the problem.And smiled to herself.Lying back down she told herself firmly that there was nothing she could do.She would just have to deal with the increased temperature.Smothered beneath thirty snoring meerkats, she soon fell back into a deep, contented, and very warm sleep.FOR THE DOCTOR FROM Savannah the following morning dawned crisp, clear, andexcept for her mercurial Meld of a companionalone.Sitting up fast she first checked the opposite ends of the gulch before letting her gaze travel to the winding rim above.There was nothing.No piercing jet black eyes, no quivering nostrils, no inquisitive stares returned her gaze.The only movement came from a speckled lizard poking its head out of a crack in the rocks.In the absence of warming sunshine it swiftly withdrew.Something large and black winged soared past high overhead, checking to see if the two figures that had been slumbering on the sand were alive or dead.The reality of Ingrids movements sent it soaring away disappointed.Across the way Whispr was also starting to wake up.When he saw her sitting up and intently scanning their surroundings he struggled to shrug off the last vestiges of a sleep that clung to him like old cobwebs.What is it, doc?Something the matter?Theyre gone.Disappointment as well as resignation colored her reply.All of them.Slipping free of his blanket Whispr rose to his feet and stretched, a human scarecrow pushing slow fists skyward.The weaselssorry, mongooses.Theyre gone?Scratching himself, he performed his own morning inspection of the narrow gulch.All was quiet, still, and exactly as might be expected of such a tranquil sceneprovided one ignored the recently raised mound of freshly excavated sand and dirt off to one side.As he began fiddling with his gear he noted that a hopeful Ingrid continued to eye the ravines rim.You miss em, dont you?She nodded.They werecharming.And that Nyala: certainly the most interesting illegal experiment I ever met.He grunted as he pulled out a breakfast envelope and carefully added water from his pak.As the liquid reacted with the catalyst in the packaging material the dehydrated contents rapidly began to heat.Havent made the acquaintance of any illegal experiments myself.Though I have met one or two Melds who should have been.He gestured with his quickly warming, expanding breakfast.Arent you hungry?Better eat something even if youre not.More walking today.He shook the bulging envelope gently, the better to mix and evenly heat the contents.Youll need the energy.Never know in a place like this when a meal might be your last one.Ignoring his characteristic pessimism she continued to scrutinize the rocky overhangs even as she prepared her own food.Sipping a mix of hot cereal, milk, sugar, and reconstituted berries, he sat and watched, unable to understand her fascination.Look, he finally said, I know the little cat rats saved our butts.For emphasis he nodded in the direction of the unprepossessing mound beneath which lay the body of the freewalker Quaffer.But theyre gone, and I for one dont miss em.He made a rude noise.Sure they were heavily magified, but they were also too close to full wild and they had too many teeth.Not to mention their little nightymare poison darts.Ingrid was shaking her own breakfast to life.Well, I do miss them.Ive never heard of a nonprimate being raised to true sentience, not even illegally.It would have been enthralling to get Nyalas perspective on so many things.She spoke wistfully.Who knows?Maybe they could even have helped us get into Nerens.At this Whispr smiled and began shaking his head.Her brows drew together as she challenged him.What?Whatd I say?Setting his empty biodegradable food container aside he chuckled briefly before meeting her eyes.DocIngridyou have more knowledge of science in your pretty little pinkie than I do in my whole besotted brain, but I have more in common with street folk.He gestured upward, toward the sand and gravel plain that was cracked by the ravine.Those mere cats, they were kinda like little subgrubs.A gang permanently on the run from the authorities.His laughter faded.Dont get me wrong: Im thankful as hell their leader decided to get all noble on us and vape the freewalker.It was getting bad squeeze there for a few minutes and I dont like to think what wouldve happened if they hadnt showed up.But spine tickling one Meld is one thing.Exposing themselves to the authorities, even private security such as SICKs, for a cause that doesnt involve them, is more of a risk than your typical street snarks are willing to take.Even, he concluded, if the snarks in question happen to hold a patent on cute.Casual pondering of her companions heartfelt observations left a reluctant Ingrid no choice but to agree with his judicious assessment of meerkat motivation.Despite all he and she had been through together she was still not in a position to challenge the wisdom of someone who held an advanced degree in the acumen of the street.Downing the last of her liquid eggs Benedict, she set the empty package aside and shouldered her pack.After adjusting the straps she took a moment to ensure that the pressure sensitive inflatable pads were correctly positioned.Bending, she picked up her wide brimmed thermosensitive hat and nodded in his direction.All set.Lets go.She squinted skyward.Nerens wont come to us.A hand gestured up the gulch.We keep on straight?Whispr checked their remaining communicator, glanced up, checked it again.Its something like ten ks to the next permanent water hole.About half along this creek bed, the rest exposed up top.Then wed better get moving.Making a final adjustment to her packs position, she started past him.Hey, slow down, doc!Youll burn out before lunch.He hurried to catch up to her.Youre still having regrets about losing your pets, arent you?Dont think about it.He tried to lift her spirits.Maybe well run into the mob again.Yeah, thats likely, she mumbled.They hiked in silence for nearly an hour before he spoke up again.This affection for the little critters, doc: it wouldnt have anything to do with you not having kids, would it?Hemmed in on both sides by layers of ancient sandstone she looked at him sharply, then shook her head.Weve spent a lot of time in each others company, Whispr, but I swear there are times when I just cant figure you.Like right now I cant decide if youre being perceptive or just utterly ignorant of the meaning of the word tact.Her pointed retort did not faze him in the slightest.Words never did.You didnt answer my question.And because of your attitude, Im not going to.Lengthening her stride, she deliberately moved out ahead of him.He shrugged and maintained his pace, content to follow.Not that he really gave a damn one way or the other about how she might have answered.Then why had he asked the question?No wonder she baffled him.There were too many times when he baffled himself.UNLIKE THE BRIEF BUT intense deluge that had nearly drowned Ingrid in a previously negotiated ravine, the rising sandstorm announced itself visually but not audibly.More alert to the unexpected and blessed with better distance vision, it was Whispr who wondered aloud at the changing color of the horizon.If we were back in a big city in Namerica Id say that was smog.The longer he gazed at the darkening phenomenon the deeper became his frown.But there cant be any smog out here.There are no big cities.Hell, there arent any cities.According to all the maps and Ouspels instructions theres nothing out here but Nowhere.He looked over at his companion.Clad in loose fitting desert gear, Pollocked with dirt, and sweating profusely, she still roused sensations in him that burned through protein better invested elsewhere.So what is it?Shielding her eyes with one hand, Ingrid squinted into the distance.Whatever the cause, it seems to be intensifying.Let me have your monocular.Halting beside her, he stood patiently while she dug through his pack to find the single lens magnifier.Peering through it, it took only a moment for her to ascertain what was coming their way.Shit, she said concisely as she put the compact optical device back in his pack.Whispr was not shocked, but he was mildly surprised.Ever since their first meeting the doctors language had been decorous tending to the excessively polite.Rough travel and hard experience were wearing her down.To his level, he told himself.That realization ought to have pleased him.Perversely, it did not.Though the passage of time was rendering her more approachable, he found to his surprise that he preferred her on her pedestal.Sandstorm, she told him.At least, thats what I think it is.Ive only ever seen a sandstorm in nature vits.Same here.He stared at the burgeoning yellow wall that was approaching rapidly from the north.Not something you see in Savannah.He began searching their immediate surroundings.Guessing from the speed at which its moving it should hit here inside an hour.Its right in front of us, we cant outrun it, and we cant go around it.Were gonna have to hunker down somewhere and ride it out.He grunted.Your cat rats would probably just shrug and wait it out in burrows.Feel like digging?She held up her hands.Physicians hands.Normally soft and sensitive, long days of difficult travel had turned them hard and tough.They were not miners or road workers hands, not yet.On the other hand (so to speak), digital decor like fingernail polish was a distant memory.Staring at her upraised fingers she saw that she needed a manicure.Her whole body needed a manicure.The flat, sandy plain across which they had been walking offered little in the way of shelter.There were no trees; nothing taller than knee high succulents.Both of them picked up the pace until they were almost jogging.Can we make it to the next ravine?she asked anxiously.By this time the sky ahead had been subsumed in yellow grit.She could hear the approaching storm now; the faint howl of a meteorological golem.Abrasive grit driven by weeping winds was scouring the landscape.Sitting and waiting it out on flat ground would not be pleasant.Walking through it would be impossible.As she looked on it seemed to gain speed toward them; a smooth faced rolling wall of unforgiving geological obfuscation.We can try, Whispr told her.He picked up the pace until he was running across the flat surface.According to Ouspels map they were very close to safety.They had made good time across the flats.Furthermore, the next concealing gully that spilled out of the foothills ran northwest.Besides offering shelter from the oncoming storm it would have the added benefit of bringing them closer to their goal.He found himself visualizing its sheltering walls.All they had to do was reach it, scramble down inside, and wait for the tempest to blow over.They could rest and regain their strength from the long hike and final dash across the plain.They could They didnt make it.The outburst did not come upon them gradually, like a rainstorm.Scouting for the airborne sand that filled the body of the storm, zephyrs of increasing strength buffeted them as they frantically sought last minute cover.Over here, doc!A madly beckoning Whispr directed her toward a slight depression that was fronted by several smooth surfaced boulders.A few scraggly Euphorbia formed a loose hedge around the depression.They had chosen the site to put down roots and propagate because water occasionally collected in the low spot, or perhaps was found deeper below the surface.It was not much of a kraal, but it was better than nothing.The truth of that determination brutally announced itself moments later.The storm did not hit.It enveloped them, swallowed them, blinded Ingrid with such unexpected alacrity that she could barely make out Whisprs attenuated form even though he was only a few meters ahead of her.With fine particles of grit stinging her face and threatening to damage her eyes, she stumbled forward.The lethal potential of a sandstorm, a danger that humans had been forced to deal with since the dawn of civilization, made no allowance for her acquired social graces or advanced education.She was in as much danger now as if she had been a veiled member of a camel caravan crossing the Sahara thousands of years ago.She found herself stumbling in near darkness, unable to hear, unable to see.Where had Whispr gone?Where was the depression?Seconds earlier both had been right in front of her.Now she couldnt see a thing.If she opened her eyes all the way, the sand that was now screaming parallel to the ground threatened to blind her.If she turned her head away to protect them, she could not see where she was going.What she needed was something technologically regressive but highly appropriate for the conditions in which she now found herself: a scarf.Holding her right arm in front of her face she staggered on.Surely she should have stepped into the depression by now?If she wandered off in the wrong direction she would be lost in minutes.And what if Whispr was looking for her?Without any idea how long the storm might last, they could become permanently separated.Shouting his name, she heard nothing.The roar of the storm overwhelmed her best efforts to make herself heard more than a foot or so from where she was standing.Since her own communicator was gone, if they did become separated he would not be able to find her.How had people located one another in such desolate places before the advent of electronic tracking?Such ancient skills were not taught in todays urban environment.And most of their remaining equipment was with him.She had food and her waterpak, but how would she survive?Alone in the worlds oldest desert, beset by ignorance and the inability to find her way, she would die a lonely death, her body picked at by scavengers, her friends and patients back home wondering how and where Dr.Ingrid Seastrom had vanished.She would never be found because no one would know where to search.It might be hundreds of years before curious travelers discovered her bones.Assuming that the desert hyenas left anything to be found.To her immense surprise, she started to cry.Again.It was amazing how easily and copiously the tears spilled from her eyes.They flushed some of the grit that had accumulated there but otherwise didnt make her feel any better.Worst of all, she thought as she sobbed, her demise would all be for naught.She would not even have the comfort of learning the secret of the thread before she died.As for Whispr, despite his street survival skills he would probably perish as well.Of course with the thread gone, secreted on her person, there would be no reason for him to continue to Nerens.If he turned back immediately instead of trying to find her body he might have a slim chance of making it back to now distant Orangemund.Unable to see where she was going, blinded by yellow instead of black, she tripped over something and went down.Farko, doc!Watch where youre going!She threw herself against him, heedless of whether she might have suffered an injury in the fall.A bigger woman would have been able to wrap her arms around his willowy melded form twice over.After a moments hesitation he gently placed his own thinner but stronger arms around her and held her close.She continued to cry until she remembered where she was and what she was doing.Pulling away from him, she tried to hug the ground.The clump of boulders and the sturdy wind whipped Euphorbia provided just enough of a windbreak to send a good deal, though not all, of the blowing sand flying over her head.She was forced to wipe continuously at her sand struck eyes.Her tears turned the accumulating grit to a kind of clenched particulate muck.As she periodically dug out the dirt she decided she didnt need a Q tipshe needed a spoon.Eventually she remembered to apologize to her companion.IIm sorry I fell on you, Whispr.I couldnt see anything.I didnt even know if I was going in the right direction.I shouted, as loud as I could, but I guess you didnt hear me.He had to raise his own voice to pump out an audible reply.I can hardly hear you now, doc.Tilting his head to one side and raising up slightly on an elbow, he tried to see beyond the rocks.Ferociously whipping sand quickly drove him back under cover.Still cant see anything, either.Reaching down, he removed his waterpak and took a long drink, careful not to spill a drop.He wiped his lips with the back of one forearm before resealing the container.Might be here for a while.How long is awhile?She lay prone next to him.He sniffed and dug into his rapidly filling nose.How should I know, doc?I dont know anything about sandstorms.Minutes, hours.Days.He nodded at the peculiar nearby plants.Look at these guys.They might be hundreds of years old.Just sitting out here, nothing to see, nothing to do, hoping that in between storms like this their spines are deterrent enough to keep off the plant eaters.He shook his head.I farking hate this country!A day in Savannah or Charleston is better than an eternity out here.Maybe not if youre a plant, she countered.Well, I wish I was one right now.One with deep roots.As he slid lower he let his gaze drift upward, blinking against the wind and sand and blowing gravel.My motherdont look at me like that, I had oneused to say that some good comes out of everything.Even though were stuck here out on the flats we shouldnt have to worry about company searchers or patrols.Even machines will shy away from this kind of weather.Gritll choke their intakes.He closed his eyes.She peered at him in disbelief.Dont tell me youre going to try to sleep through this?His eyelids fluttered but did not open.I once slept through a free ten band spatially multiamped technopulse concert in Jackson Park.This is nothing.He went quiet.Having little else to say and no one to say it to, Ingrid tried to emulate her companions sangfroid.She had only limited success.The Sum of Her Parts     7 Goddamn storm!Volksmann wrestled with the controls as the floater lurched to port.Not an aircraft, it was unable to rise above the furious winds.He was in no position to object to the choice of transport since he was among those who had from the beginning vetoed the suggestion that an aircraft be used for the intrusion.You cant take a plane or a chopper into the Sperrgebeit, he had explained to his superiors in Guangzhou via closed satellite link.SICK security would pick it up immediately.And ground transport will show up on their searcher drone sensors.The only thing that has a hope of working is a fast floater.Keep low to the ground but above it, get in fast and get out fast.And its still going to be risky as hell.If a floater has a chance of getting in and getting out, Hsing Pa inquired reasonably from Triad headquarters, then why are such attempts not made more often?Because theres nothing to be gained from just getting in and getting out.Volksmann was patient with the older man.You have to have a worthwhile reason for going in beyond being able to boast that you did so.Every such incursion I know of involved prospectors.A ten minute visit isnt long enough to find and mine diamonds.It isnt even long enough to locate a site.Especially when eight minutes of it would have to be spent looking over your shoulder.But its plenty of time to land, kill two people, take what they have, and leave.Hsing considered.Will you need that much time on site?Volksmann had shrugged.Five minutes.Another five as buffer.The Triad operations chief nodded once.Since we are not entirely sure what we are looking for, you should bring everything out.Including the bodies in case there is something of significance secreted within their persons.Thats what I figured.I dont anticipate any problems.Volksmann had spoken with confidence.He had not, however, anticipated having to navigate at night in the depths of a sandstorm.They could have set the floater down and waited it out.But lingering in one place for any length of time might expose them to passing satellite coverage, or bring them to the attention of a drone.Now he had no choice.He and his team were committed.Though they had been strapped into their seats for less than an hour, the five associates in the passenger compartment behind him were already grumbling like new Melds who were convinced they had overpaid for bad work.Releasing himself from his restraints Volkmanns second in command came forward, staggering as the floater pitched from side to side in the sand shot slipstream.Dropping into the empty codrivers seat he gripped the armrests firmly and squinted through the cockpits curving polycrylic windshield.How long we have to keep arguing with this bitch, Karl?Grim faced, the squad leader kept his attention focused on the floater consoles instrumentation.He had no choice, because he couldnt see a damn thing outside.If the last position the Triads satellite buy in gave for them is accurate we should be just about on top of them.Rocking back and forth in his seat, Xiau grinned.Hell, man, you set down on top of them and we wont even have to shoot!Well just scrape em into a couple of body bags.Volksmann shook his head tersely.Personally I wouldnt have any problem squashing them, but we cant do that.We might bust whatever it is were supposed to bring back.Any idea what that is?Must be something big serious for the Yeoh to risk sending a full squad into the Sperrgebeit.I dont have a glueclue, and you know better than to ask.You know the instructions.Bring them out alive if possible, dead if not, along with everything in their immediate vicinity thats not native, down to and including any bodily excretions.He made a rude sound.But youre right about one thing: must be big serious.A powerful gust caught the floater and slewed it to port.Volksmann cursed under his breath as he fought with the controls.Commentary of an equally colorful nature rose from the men and women seated in back.One of the dash readouts spoke up, pleasant but insistent.The floaters driver growled.Whats wrong?Untrained to interpret the floaters sputtering commentary, Xiau had to rely on his boss for an explanation.Sands getting through the filters.We dont have any choice now.Were going to have to set down, wait for the storm to let up, and do a manual clean out.Forecasting cant predict for sure when this will stop.Volksmann glanced at another readout.Were closereal close.Even with the delay we should be right on our target and up and out of here before morning.Back in good ol Alex Bay before sunrise.Thats all that matters.That and picking up the two meats.He grunted.Well be fine as long as we dont hang around long enough to be visible in the Geit in the light.Xiau nodded understandingly.Me and the others, we didnt get a lot of jobbo detail.A twofold pickup and sitewipe is all we were told.Should we be looking for any trouble?Volksmann felt he had acquired sufficient control as the floater began to descend to spare a glance for his number two.Targets are a street Meld, male, and a physician, female.The Zaniwars of Spring 49 this aint.Leaning back in his seat Xiau rode the bucking floater as it hit the ground, bounced once, and finally came to rest between low scrub covered dunes.A smattering of sarcastic applause punctuated by a few choice expletives sounded from the passenger area.Suits me.Nothing I like better than a soft objective that doesnt fight back.Have to wonder what a lady doc is doing out here, though.Gazing through the windshield, Xiau saw nothing.As Volksmann shut the floater down the steady burr of the engine was replaced by a staccato rapping, as if the vehicle had come under simultaneous fire from a thousand pellet guns.Driven by the wind, sand spattered against the front and sides of the transport.While the flying grit was potent enough to flay skin, it did not penetrate the tough polycrylic windows or the composite body.Neither the storm nor the darkness intimidated Xiau.He had survived far more cogent and deadly attacks.Relieved to be at rest, the remainder of the squad gratefully unbuckled themselves from their travel harnesses.Men and women whose noxious profession was not sanctioned by any legal body joked and swapped playful insults as they stretched and availed themselves of the transports supply of refreshments.Once outside and on the ground this promised to be an easy job.
