A Drive to Europa  Some static played in between stations as he struggled to tune in to a jazz station from Europa.He was on his way to pick up a passenger there, and he wasnt quite in range to reach the intergalactic sounds of trumpets and saxophones.Come on you piece of garba  ...there we go.Thats all I wanted, the driver said, as his right hand pulled away from the knob of his radio, jazz starting to fade in.He finished off his cigarette and put it out in the ashtray that folded out from underneath the radio.A saxophone bounced from note to note in a swingin beat as the drivers yellow cab raced along Intergalactic Roadway 75 toward Europa.The driver reached up to scratch his shaggy brown hair and muttered something about needing to patch another hole in his brown pub hat.His right hand scraped along the blistered brown leather passenger seat feeling for his pack of cigarettes hed only bought before leaving Earth.Feeling the softness of the package, he knew immediately he was out.Dammit.Those smaller packs really do run out fast, he muttered, as he came upon his exit.The yellow beams of the intergalactic roadway beneath the space taxi started to look a little less blurry as the driver slowed to exit the roadway and head down to Europa.His taxi shook a little as he entered the atmosphere of Jupiters moon, but ultimately, the old cab held up fine; it always did.As he came down onto the white tundra, he found the village he was looking for.Astara, population of 10,045, was where his future passenger sat in waiting.The town below looked worn; several older metal buildings of various heights lined the main road.Every other part of the town slept...except for the area with the bars.When humans had terraformed a number of the planets in the galaxy, they brought a number of different materials to each celestial body they made habitable for mankind as intergalactic roadways were first established.The one resource that every planet had in common?Booze.As the driver brought down the taxi, he cranked up the heater.I hate the damn cold here...hope the girl Im waiting on is quick, the driver said.He stopped his vehicle, and he heard the ice crunch under him as the space cab came to rest.Europa was covered in ice, and underneath was a vast ocean.That meant there was money to make pulling water out of the moon, commencing the desalination process to purify the water, and shipping it to whomever could pay for it.The driver was a little antsy.He hated Europa.The moon was a little tougher than most inhabited worlds because most of the population consisted of roughnecks working drills to pull out water.Booze and roughnecks didnt make a good combination in the drivers mind.A knock at his back passenger door caused him to crank his neck toward the sound.He saw a rather petite woman with long straight purple hair blowing in the icy wind.She was wearing a thick brown coat and had no gloves on.All in all, he considered her a little punkish and out of sorts with the area.He rolled down his back window a little and asked, Karmen?Thats me.Can you open the door?My ass is freezing out here, and I need to go, Karmen said.Ill knock 30 units off your fare if you run back into the bar behind you and get me a pack of Redillo cigarettes, the driver said.Open the door, let me put my bag in, and you have a deal, she said.He unlocked the door, and she tossed in a small black duffel bag with some kind of jungle cat pattern on it.Shorts or longs?Longs, he said.She closed the door and went back inside.Five minutes later, she had returned.She got into the cab and tossed them up at him.They hit his pub hat and bounced into the passenger seat.Nice catch, she said.Nice throw, he muttered back at her.He looked back at his client.She had a simple nose piercing and some kind of small Japanese marking tattooed above her right eyebrow.Nice hat.I dont think Ive seen a single person wearing one like it, she said.It was my grandfathers, the driver said, taking it off and rubbing it a little before putting it back on his head and reaching for a cigarette.Nice piece of history you got there...kind of like this cab, she said, looking unimpressed with the interior.Dont you go insulting Starla like that, the driver said, turning the radio up a little.Starla?The cab youre sitting in is named Starla.Ive driven her for 25 years, and she hasnt ever let me down.Shes a one of a kind classy machine.The body of Starla is actually made from the leftover shell of a taxicab from over 200 years ago, before vehicles even really left the planet, the driver said, clearly proud of his vehicle.You named your taxi?Yeah, Starla.You know, like I work for Starlight Taxi?Is it really that hard to understand?Whatever...can we please just get to Mars?My sisters birthday party is coming up, Karmen said.Sure thing, the driver said, as the taxi slowly buzzed back to life, leading to a gradual, but altogether, successful takeoff.As the driver put Starla onto Intergalactic Roadway 32 to Mars, he heard his radio station go back to static.Well crap...that was the one good thing about that moon was KKTP 91.4 jazz hits, the driver sighed.About time.Care if I plug in my music pod?Starla only has a ZM radio.Sorry about that, the driver said.This thing really doesnt have  Karmen was cut off by a flat stare in the rearview mirror from the driver.I mean  Starla really doesnt have anything but a radio?No, but the heater works, the oxygen filtration system works, and at least two of the four power windows work.Not to mention, she flies from planet to planet.Id say that makes her a decent machine, the driver said, rubbing the steering wheel.Karmen sighed, and Starla was silent for another hour before the driver finally asked if she was cool with some small talk.Asking permission for small talk seems a little odd to me, she said, raising an eyebrow.Youd be surprised.I get two kinds of passengers, ones that want to chat and ones that dont.Which are you?Chatting is fine, Karmen said, leaning on the seat in front of her with her elbows.Youre a bartender?I am.Im considering a transfer to Mars to be closer to family, but the money on Europa is just too good since they have trouble getting workers, Karmen said.They talked about the particulars of her job for a while.The driver appeared to be generally interested in her career.He only stopped asking questions when she explained a particular part of her job or when he needed to grab another cigarette.As they approached Mars, Karmen was finishing up with yet another gripe about Europa.So were constantly running out of supplies because shipments are so far and few inbetween, she said.You run out of booze?No, just the things youd never think of.Like?Tiny straws and napkins.Right now were using these little bendy straws from the towns only store.Theyre pretty pathetic, she said.Starla handled Mars atmosphere about as well as Europas.The vehicle came down into the small city of New Denver, population of 120,000.A few skyscrapers stood out in front of a small mountain range, just outside of which, New Denver sat.The driver maneuvered Starla through traffic and finally came down in front of a smaller red townhouse on a busy street.He pulled off to the side, and Karmen paid him before going to get out.I have a question about being an intergalactic cab driver, she said.Shoot, the driver said.Dont you ever get lonely?Im an orphan with no family, not too many people to miss.I have a few friends here and there at the cab company, the driver said.Youre only friends are other cab drivers?And Starla, he said, rubbing the dashboard.Karmen laughed and tapped her black nails on the hood of the cab.Thanks for the ride, Starla, and you too..., she trailed off, not knowing his name.Do you really wanna know my name?Are you ever really going to see me again?I might invite you to my bar if youre ever lonely, she said.Ill keep that in mind.Have fun at your sisters birthday, the driver said, slowly lifting Starla off the ground.Karmen pouted for a moment and said, Fine.Be that way.You know where my bar is.I do...on that stupid ice ball with all the roughnecks...great destination, he said.She winked at him and then closed the door.The drivers eyes getting heavy reminded him that he was in need of a good nights sleep.He headed toward the nearest cheap motel, reaching for another cigarette, only to realize he was out again.Dammit....2: Fare is Fair  The drivers stomach growled as he rushed down Intergalactic Road 12 to Larissa, a small moon of Neptune.The cosmic body of Larissa really only served as a sort of ship stop for those on their way to the outer stretches of the galaxy.It was popular among commercial ship drivers because of a legendary pizza place inside.It was called Sizzeranos Pizzeria, and the pies there were hefty in price to say the least.Damn Italian pizza shop owner...making pies that I couldnt afford without saving money.No self respecting pizza lover should have to save money just to get a pizza.One of the staples of the food is that it is supposed to be affordable, the driver muttered angrily.He was in a foul mood as he always was when he was hungry.He was actually about to go on his lunch break when he got called out on this job.He had to take his lunch break at 12:30 p. m.  every day he worked, or he simply did not get a lunch.Trying to eat any later resulted in his boss jumping down his throat for timecard irregularities.The driver could hear his boss yelling at him the more he thought about it.Lunch is taken at lunch time.Thats why its called lunch!The problem with today wasnt simply that the driver was hungry; it was that he missed his lunch break on top of that, and he really wanted a hot meal.I guess this makes reason #12 why I shouldnt skip breakfast every day, the driver sighed.The driver liked to stay up late watching movies, so, he usually slept in as much as he could in the mornings.The problem with this was he was usually running out the door to get to work on time, meaning, no breakfast.He always counted on lunch being his first meal of the day.He put his thoughts on something more exciting to get his mind off of hunger and out of bittertown.Scenes from the previous nights movie began to play in the drivers mind.He had taken a chance on a thriller titled The Call, and he wasnt sure what to make of it.His immediate thought was he hated it, but the more he thought about the slow pace of the movie, the more he realized the writing was actually rather intellectual and artistic.He didnt normally enjoy movies like that, but this movie was getting difficult to forget about.As Starla jettisoned past Uranus, he began to think about food again, primarily...pizza.The person he was going to transport was actually being picked up from Sizzeranos Pizzeria.Talk about adding insult to injury.I cant afford the pizza, but I can pick up the people that make it, the driver said, his mood souring once more.He reached over and banged on top of Starlas glovebox a couple times, and it opened, a pack of cigarettes falling out.The driver grabbed one and pulled it out of the package.This ought to help kill my appetite, the driver said, lighting up.As the nicotine entered his system, his sour mood lifted ever so slightly.Well thats about as good as Ill get, the driver said.Half an hour later he set Starla down in front of Sizzeranos.The old cab groaned as it came to rest softly on the ground.The station was actually pretty busy.The driver noticed several large ships being parked, and their drivers were going inside to relieve themselves after choosing not to stop at the casino moons that orbited Uranus.Most of the people were men, but there were some women...and then there some women that might as well have been men.They may have been missing the y chromosome and necessary reproductive organ to be considered a male biologically, but as far as they could spit, and as much as they could eat, they may as well have been one of the boys.The driver saw his client coming straight for the taxi.That was one of the advantages of video calls as opposed to simple audio calls.He got to see his passenger before he met them.It was just fortunate that the driver happened to be near a video monitor when the call came in.A slow moaning could be heard as Starlas power locks opened to allow the passenger in.He was very young and seemed to be of Korean descent.The driver had taken people of all nationalities and races wherever they wanted to go for 25 years, so, he could identify someone by their looks or even the language they spoke nine times out of 10.As the older teen got into Starla, the driver turned and got a better look at him.He had a very thin goatee that the driver figured he had been working on for quite some time.The passenger caught him staring and said, Im old enough to ride in a cab.I didnt ask, the driver said, turning back around.I just turned 18.That means I can legally take a taxi anywhere I want, the teen said.He spoke great English and had no specific accent.This kids parents are probably legitimately Korean and raised him outside the region, the driver thought.Listen...The driver was cut off by the legal adult saying, You can call me Jin.Sighing, the driver said, Jin...I didnt ask for your age.If you say youre 18, youre 18.I cant afford to be picky about my clients.They sat in an awkward silence for a moment as Jin, who was clearly a firecracker of a repressed teen/legal adult, thought about how to unembarass himself.Of course, when that process was determined to be futile by Jin, he asked, Why havent we left yet?Do you need fuel?I need a destination, the driver said.Oh...Midwest City please, Jin said.You commute from Earth to Larissa to work at Sizzeranos?Damn that Italian must pay good, the driver said, bringing Starla back to life as he flew the taxi out of the atmosphere.Jin scoffed and said, If that man paid good, Id use the electron transporter and be at Earth instantly instead of riding in this beat up machine.As it stands, he gets away with paying lousy because the One Galaxy Republics tax enforcers generally dont care about anything beyond the casino moons of Uranus.After snapping at Jin about calling Starla by inappropriate adjectives and lighting up another cigarette, the driver thought, This kid just randomly surrenders any and all information about his life...who does that?And no, I dont commute.I rent a small room above the pizzeria...or at least I did...before I quit, Jin said, looking at Neptune as Starla started to put distance between herself and the blue planet.The driver stifled yet another sigh putting the pieces of Jins life together.The kid had a duffle bag with him and some other kind of large square black nylon bag.It looked like a pizza carrier hed swiped...probably to put some of his things in.He had run away from home to try to prove a point to his overly strict parents...and hed had enough after a year or two.He was admitting defeat and going home because he hated his boss more than his father.Jin stayed surprisingly quiet until they passed Jupiter, and he started to ask questions, which annoyed the driver.So...whats your name?You can just call me driver.Thats a strange hat...whered you get it?Gift from my grandfather.He would normally make conversation with his passengers if they wanted, and Jin clearly wanted to talk, but he was hungry again, and that knocked his already questionable levels of happiness down another few notches.You got any tips on what to say to parents you havent seen in two years?Nope.Im an orphan, never had any parents to say anything to, the driver said.That shut Jin up again and sent him into another awkward spiral.The driver didnt mind the awkward silence.Silence was silence, and it was what he needed since he didnt have the energy to make small talk.When they got to Mars, Jin stepped up to the plate one more time, attempting to draw some kind of personable reaction from the driver.Man, Im glad to be out of that place.You have no idea what its like to waste your life at a job that hardly pays anything, Jin said, only catching himself after he was finished speaking.I.  ..didnt mean that  None taken.I actually enjoy driving Starla for a living.It has paid my bills for the last 25 years, the driver said.Good grief...how old were you when you started driving?You dont look that old to have been driving for 25 years, Jin said.I was 16 when I first started.I ran away from the 10th orphanage Id been in, and my current hard ass of a boss took pity on me, giving me a job and something to do, the driver said.As they neared Earth, the driver decided to give Jin a little break and offer some advice.At least hes making an effort to return home...that took takes some guts.He was, at the very least, smart enough to realize maybe he didnt have it quite so bad at his former home.I can somewhat respect that, the driver thought.Listen, Jin.Id just tell your dad what he wants to hear.Say that you were wrong, and he was right.Your family will probably just be so happy to see you alive that they wont give you too much of a hard time, especially when you admit your wrongs, the driver said.What if I still dont think I was wrong?Then youd better be prepared to beg for your job back from that stingy Italian man, the driver said.Jin said nothing but looked outside at the traffic that was increasing as they got closer to Earth.The yellow light of the intergalactic road they were on showed deep thought on Jins face.Admitting youre wrong gets a whole lot easier when you realize that 90% of the time what youre fighting over is something stupid, the driver said, guessing that Jins parents doubted his ability to make it in the real world, and that set him off.Angry, he ran away from home, only to end up near the edge of the galaxy on Larissa, working for a pizzeria owned by an apparently stingy Italian man.Jin was silent the rest of the trip except to give the driver an address to land at.Midwest City was located in what used to be the United States of America, and it was the agricultural capital of the Earth.It was a city surrounded by thousands of miles of farmland and the giant spaceport city was where Earth exported its largest resource...food.The driver took Starla into the west part of the city that was mostly made up of blue collar workers...lower middle class.
