So Karmen dumped you.Guys get dumped every day.I must have been dumped by 20 women before I found Nancy, Chris said.Now I know youre full of crap.I doubt you could have ever gotten 20 women to date you, even out of pity, the driver said.He picked up his spilled glass, which amazingly wasnt broken, and reached for another drink.Solstice came over to examine what little drops of Scotch had populated across the wooden floor.Karmen didnt know about your mothers bad timing.You cant blame her for that, Chris said.Yeah...I guess youre right, the driver muttered.The two sat in stillness for a moment, listening to Solstice lick the wooden floor.I guess now that youve explained your mothers plans, it lines up with the memo we managers got today from David Lester.You know him?Yeah...weve met, the driver said, remembering his unpleasant conversation with the Starlight Taxi CEO to get Chris job back.Well, he received a surprise offer from Rider Corp.to purchase Starlight Taxi early this morning.By afternoon, hed sent out a note to managers that he was going to sell the company, apparently to your mother.When she gets her hands on Starlight Taxi, shell undoubtedly gut the company, Chris said.The driver exchanged a glance with Chris immediately, not believing his ears.She cant do that!Actually, if she owns the company, like she will by close of business tomorrow, she can do what she damn well pleases, Chris said.That bitch, the driver thought, scowling.Theres no way the finance regulators of the One Galaxy Republic would let such a quick deal go through.Stuff like this takes time, doesnt it?Chris shook his head sadly.Shes loaded.She probably paid off enough regulators to get the deal pushed through.Thats one of the advantages of extreme wealth.Nobody can stop you, Chris said.The driver stood up and clenched his fists.She wont get away with this, he said.Chris sighed and patted him on the back.Look, I get it.This is a bum wrap.Youve a right to be angry, but thats why were boozing it up tonight.Short of giving into your mothers demands, I dont think there is anything you can do about this one.Now, you impressed me when you got my job back last time, but this is something you wont be able to pull off, Chris said.Bullshit, the driver said, wobbling into his bathroom.Where are you going?Fishing through his cabinet, he found a small blue bottle of pills.He opened it and swallowed a blue pill with a drink of water.Then, he slowly walked back into the living room.What did you do?I always keep a box of sober pills for emergencies like this, the driver said.God bless those little pills full of nanomachines that go through the blood and clean it out, the driver thought.Okay...so youre going to be sober in a few minutes after spending the past couple hours working hard at getting drunk.What are you up to?Im going to fix this, he said.Chris stood up and said, Listen to me.There isnt anything you can do about this one.These people are big, and the amount of wealth and power they possess is staggering.I get that you hate not being able to put pieces back together after something bad happens, but this isnt something you can just go out and change.I cant accept his, Chris.You may be content with just giving up because the challenge looks impossible, but that isnt who I am.You know Im not just going to let this go, the driver said, locking eyes with his boss.Chris growled and slapped his face.My God, youre never going to change.No matter how hard Ive tried to raise you, youre always going to be this ridiculously stubborn guy, arent you?The driver smiled as he felt his mind resharpening and the effects of the alcohol leaving his system at a highly accelerated rate.Sorry, Chris.Apparently its in my blood.My grandfather was, according to Shirley, the most obstinate human in existence.The guy made mules look docile and submissive.Promise me you arent going to do something stupid, Chris said, a genuine concern filling his voice.Im not going to make a promise I cant keep, the driver said, turning to go.Solstice walked with him, eager to go wherever he planned to go.He opened the door and turned back, matching eyes with Chris.Hey...you know...you and Nancy are who I really consider my mother and father, right?This new bitch trying to come into my life to force my hand doesnt change that in the slightest.Those sober pills must not work all that great.That sounds like the booze talking, Chris said, laughing.Whatever, you geezer, the driver said, turning to leave.I know, kid.In spite of your inhuman stubborn streak, were proud to have raised you as best we could, Chris said.The driver didnt turn around but merely coughed and said, Love ya too.He left immediately after, running out to Starla with Solstice.Getting inside and starting up the taxi, he took off.At 11:30 p. m.  local time, there wasnt much traffic above the skies of Lefont as the driver hit the gas and hopped up through the atmosphere into space.He headed for Phobos, hoping two actors in particular would be on the world famous for its living movie sets.After about an hour, the driver arrived at Mars moon and put Starla down just outside of the same hotel hed once picked up Sammy and Don from.The two actors were famous for playing brothers that were detectives on a drama called Pieces.Theyd played the same characters for 19 years, and the driver had convinced them to try some new things last time they were all in the cab together.Walking into the hotel through two large sliding glass doors, the driver looked down at his reflection in the white marble floor.Damn this place reeks of elegance, the driver muttered, thinking of Shirley.Walking up to the front counter, he spoke to a man wearing a blue suit and a red tie with a shaved head.Can I help you?The mans glance seemed to place an underlying tone that said, Hurry up and do what you need to so you can leave, urchin.This guy should marry Shirley and take over Rider Corp., the driver thought.Um, Im a cab driver for Starlight Taxi.Could you please page two of your guests and have them come down to the lobby?What room are they in?I honestly wasnt told.Theyre Sammy and Don, the driver said, forgetting their last names at the worst possible time.The man typed a few keystrokes into his glass display and said nothing for a few seconds, reading through some sort of spreadsheet.Damn it, I knew they wouldnt be here, the driver thought.Ah yes, the detectives are in 407.Ill call them down immediately, the man said, picking up a phone and calling up to them.I knew they were here, the driver thought, smirking and forgetting about his previous speculation full of despair.A few minutes later, they came down, surprised to see the driver.He led them over to a different part of the lobby and asked them if he could talk with them for a little bit.Sammy nodded and said, Sure.You want to grab a seat at the bar?Don groaned and said, Oh come on!The Cubs are on!Please.Its dire, the driver said.He rolled his eyes, and the two of them led the driver over to the bar on the first floor.They sat on red bar stools in a place that the driver had to admit wasnt as upscale as he imagined it to be.This is where movie stars came to drink while on Phobos, and it looked like a regular bar back on Earth.He put his elbow on the glass bar in front of him and ordered beers for himself, Sammy and Don.Well listen as long as youre paying for the booze, Don said, smiling and taking his pint.Sammy, clearly the nicer of the two, asked, Whats up?The driver proceeded to explain his situation as quickly as he could.He told them about his mother, why she hated him, and how she was going to buy Starlight Taxi and have it shut down, costing hundreds of drivers their jobs, just to make a point to the driver.When he finished, Don said, Well, you have our agreement.Shes definitely a bitch.Sammy asked, Shed really spend millions to buy this company just to gut it and make you suffer?Yes.Youve no idea of her depravity, the driver said, ordering another round of beers for Don and Sammy.Don took another drink and belched.Then, he said, Well thats an interesting tale.Dont get me wrong, I appreciate the booze and story, but...what are you telling us this for?Sighing, the driver said, This is going to sound crazy and direct, but Im out of options.This was sprung on me fairly quick.Spit it out, Don said.Sammy elbowed him.Please outbuy Rider Corp.and purchase Starlight Taxi before all of the drivers, including myself, lose their jobs, the driver said.Sammy and Don exchanged glances.Don asked, You want us to...buy the cab company you drive for?I know it sounds crazy, and I suck at financial pitches, but I heard the company turns a profit.David Lester, the CEO, is actually pretty wealthy, the driver said, lying about the profit rumor.Sammy took a drink and looked at the driver saying, When do you need an answer?Its still about 11 p. m.  in San Francisco where the corporate office is.Id have an offer into David Lester by 8 a. m.  tomorrow if I were going to sneakily buy it, the driver said.Don finished another drink and smiled, saying, I dont know the first thing about taxis.You could learn, Im sure.It cant be that hard, the driver said.Even still...were actors, not investors, Don said.Before the driver could say anything more, Sammy put a hand on his shoulder and said, Just let us think it over.I cant make any promises, because frankly, youre probably asking us to shell out a good chunk of our fortunes, and this is such a random request and small time frame.I understand.All I ask is that you talk it over amongst yourselves.You dont even have to tell me your decision.Im sorry to spring this on you two, but I am desperate, the driver said.And were the only rich people youve met, Don said.And that, the driver said, coughing lightly.The driver got up and bumped his payment bracelet against the bartenders bracelet, clearing his tab for the drinks.Thanks for hearing me out, the driver said.Sure, anytime, Sammy said.Well...not anytime.Id prefer you not ambush us with random business ventures in the future, Don said, but Sammy elbowed him in the gut again.The driver smiled and then walked back outside to Starla.Getting in, Solstice whined.You probably have to go, dont you?Hurry up and go in those bushes before anyone sees us, the driver said, opening her door.Amazingly enough, she hopped right into the bushes and did her business.She got back into the car right as a large man with gardening tools started to run up.Hey!Uh oh.Exit stage right, the driver said, laughing as he took off with Starla.The gardeners shouts vanished as Starla headed into the blackness of space back toward Earth.Well, I played my hand.I guess its time to call and hope my mothers hand is worse than my own, the driver thought to himself as he hopped onto Intergalactic Road 34 and went back home.The next day the driver went to work as usual, and though he tried to think of what would happen if today was his last day, he failed.Don and Sammy were all he could think about.He kept wondering incessantly if they would come through for him.As the workday drew to a close, he found himself in San Francisco outside the Starlight Taxi headquarters.Going inside, he managed to snag an elevator and head straight up for David Lesters office.Getting out of the elevator and walking down the hall into David Lesters lobby, he saw a familiar secretary.The man that was Davids secretary was wearing a black button down shirt and a gray skirt showing off her shaved legs.This guy..., the driver thought.She frowned when she saw the driver.Hello...Tanya, the driver said.She did not return the greeting.Ill ask nicely this time.Will you please tell Mr.Lester Im here to see him?She slowly buzzed her boss.Mr.Lester?That stupid cab driver is here again.What do you want me to tell him?Send him in, David said.She looked shocked at Davids command but motioned for the driver to on ahead of her into the office.The driver slowly walked into his office, and when he got inside, he saw David, wearing that same purple suit he apparently loved so much.His red hair was cut a little shorter than the driver remembered from last time.Looking directly into Davids brown eyes behind his black framed glasses, the driver said, Mr.Lester, I believe you know why Im here.He sighed and walked over to the driver.I guess youre here to see what happens with your mother, David said.Shirley told you about our relationship?Yes.I have to admit, I was quite shocked to learn that the heir to Rider Corp., one of Starlight Taxis biggest competitors, was working for me.Im not the heir  Spare me your family drama.I dont care, David said, raising a hand.Tanyas voice came over a speaker and said, Mr.Lester?Shirley Rider is here to see you.Send her in, please, David said.The glass door opened, and in walked the drivers mother, wearing a blue sundress, pearl necklace, and matching pearl earrings.Clarence, I thought you might be here, she said, smiling.He said nothing but watched as David walked over and kissed her hand.Its a pleasure to have you here in San Francisco, he said.The pleasure is mine.I respect you as a business colleague and rival.Im glad we could work out a deal to bring our companies together, she said.Well, thats it then, the driver thought, looking outside the window.A thick fog had bellowed into town, and the driver could hardly see the other office building across the street.An awkward silence filled the room, and Shirley asked, Are the papers ready to sign?David let out an almost inaudible sigh and said, As much as it pains me to say, Ms.Rider...I sold company just minutes prior to your arrival.The driver gasped and looked at David with wide eyes.Surely you jest, Shirley said, a worried tone filling her voice.Im afraid not.You see, early this morning, two clients called me up and made me a better offer, so, I signed off on it a little bit ago, David said.Call it off!Ill double their offer, Shirley said, raising her voice.I cant do that.Any more money, and the offer would be taxed at a higher bracket by One Galaxy Republic tax enforcers.The two clients stayed just below that limit making the most profit possible, David said.The driver smiled, and Shirley looked at him with eyes full of hatred and disgust.What did you do?I dont know what youre talking about, the driver said.Dont play coy with me you insufferable idiot!I honestly have no idea what youre talking about Ms...was it...Rider?She growled, and the driver turned to leave.Nice chatting with you, Mr.Lester, he said.This isnt over, Clarence!He turned around one last time and locked eyes with her.Why dont you go take a long walk off a short pier, he said, before leaving through the glass door of Davids office.Walking out, he turned and looked at Tanya before saying, Im sorry I was rude to you before, Tanya.Please accept my apology.By the way, that skirt looks great on you.He left a flustered secretary behind and walked into the elevator.Once the doors closed, he jumped and began to laugh with joy at having outmaneuvered his mother.I cant believe Sammy and Don came through for me, he said, laughing so hard his eyes began to water.Exiting the office building, he walked over to Starla and hugged the taxi.Well girl, looks like were going to be just fine.A few people walking by murmured amongst themselves, but the driver didnt care.Hed just saved his job...and for the second time...Chris job; not to mention, the jobs of thousands of other drivers.In the end, he got to continue doing what he loved best...driving Starla through the galaxy, meeting new people, and all beside his faithful canine companion.Karmen was still on his mind, but he wasnt nearly as sad about the situation as he once was.That sorrow had been overshadowed by excitement at saving his job and pissing off Shirley.The driver was convinced hed find someone else if it was meant to be.He just hoped he wouldnt have to come close to death to meet his next girlfriend.Until then, he had Starla and Solstice.He really couldnt have asked for anything more.Epilogue:  Itd been a few days since the driver had last seen his mother and saved Starlight Taxi.Things were pretty much back to normal.He was driving around the galaxy from planet to planet, picking people up and dropping them off.It was Friday, and the driver had just dropped off a customer on the moon in Senora City.The customer, a strange woman traveling with two parrots, had just paid him and left when another customer got into the back seat.Im almost done for the day, so, if youre wanting a ride to the edge of the galaxy, Im afraid youll have to call another cab, the driver said without looking back.A familiar voice said, Im actually heading to Earth.Is that close enough?The driver turned around to see Octavia sitting in his back seat with a cello case.I have to admit...I didnt expect to see you again, he said.Youll be pleased to know Im taking your advice.I just left my parents a note explaining that Im going to travel for a year to find myself, she said.And the family money you are so used to?I suppose I need to get a job to earn my own money, she said.He smirked and asked, Where to on Earth?Any place you think is hiring, she said.Thinking for a moment, the driver said, I think our communications lady at the Starlight Taxi hub in Lefont is about to retire.I happen to know the boss fairly well and could probably put in a good word for you.Id like that, she said.Lefont it is, then, he said, putting Starla up into the air.Octavia was silent for a few minutes while petting Solstice, who was laying in the front seat, but she eventually asked, So your name really isnt Clarence, is it?God no.Octavia pulled out a bag of small crackers from a pocket and opened it, asking, What is it, then?My name is Arthur Thompson, but if youre nice, I might just let you call me Art.
