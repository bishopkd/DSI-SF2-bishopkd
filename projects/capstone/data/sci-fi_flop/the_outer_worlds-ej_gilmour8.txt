She took off the combat visor and slumped back in her seat.TWELVE      Ajax looked sternly down through the glass cover of the sleeping pod.Cynthia was resting peacefully.He took a sip of his hip flask.The warm taste of Halogen Hurricane warmed the back of his throat.Michael entered the cargo bay.This young woman nearly got us all killed with her rescue antics, grumbled Ajax.I think we should leave her at the next stop.Michael looked down at Cynthias pale face and then glanced across at Ajax.She saved your life on Herman Beta.Ajaxs eyes narrowed; he stared at Michael in disbelief.You have to be joking, Cap.Ivan said you saved me.You werent going to make it out.You only had a minute or two left.It was an impossible situation.There was no way we could carry you; you would have been dead before we reached the outskirts of the settlement.Cynthia refused to leave without you.She risked her life to save you.She wouldnt leave without me, repeated Ajax in a whisper.He stared at her without blinking and dropped the hip flask; the liquor leaked out onto the floor.Shes a good young woman, Ajax, said Michael as he turned away and walked toward the engine room.Ajax stood in that same spot for a long time and pondered Michaels words.**  The crew were seated around the table in the living room.Acaciuss stern dark eyes were staring across the table at Michael.I want everyone to meet my teacher, Acacius Trifon.He will be joining our crew, said Michael.They each introduced themselves and before long the conversation reverted to the events on Zeno Par.Somehow the aliens learned of our location, said Acacius.They may have already reported our presence to the End Machine.The aliens would have scanned the entire surface of the planet before the attack, said Sara.They would surely have Michaels face on file after the events on Herman Beta 3.They transfer continuous visual data streams from their scanners to the closest battleship.Thats how they found you.Then we will have to be careful, said Acacius.We must discuss how we are going to reach Epheria Prime.Epheria Prime!Impossible, grunted Ajax.No one can cross the borders of the Epherian Empire.There must be a way, said Acacius.There is no way, said Ajax.You know that better than anyone, Cap, and why are we even thinking about going to Epheria Prime?We have to rescue someone, said Michael.What?Another rescue!Cap, we are a salvage crew.Whats this all about?I dont want to be a rescuer.Why are we suddenly becoming a charity outfit?No one said a word for a few moments.We need to save the galaxy, said Michael.Save the galaxy from what?asked Ajax.A darkness so deep and terrible that no one can stand against its power, said Acacius.We must seek out the Magnifier.She is on Epheria Prime, and without her we will not be able to save humanity from the everlasting night which is descending on us all.A shadow is reaching out across the galaxy.The End Machine has found humanity and is seeking to enslave us.There could be a way to stop the machine, but we dont stand a chance without the Magnifier.Ajax lowered his eyes, crossed his arms, and leaned back in his seat.He looked up at Michael from beneath his deeply furrowed brow.Sweet ablation!Thats just perfect, grumbled Ajax.No profits and no way to cross the Epherian border.Do you know what happens to ships when they approach the Epherian frontier?Theyre incinerated!The Epherians border cannons dont ask questions; they just shoot.Even battleships are turned into space dust.We will find a way, said Michael, but they could sense the uncertainty in his voice.Theres no way, Cap, said Ajax.This idea of saving the galaxy is madness.Ethan tapped the table, and they turned their attention to him.I know a way, but its not going to be easy.Im listening, said Michael.Theres a planet called Arist 12; some of you may have heard of it.Thats where the Epherians mine Aristonium, said Sara.Thats right, said Ethan with a nod.The planet is situated in the Outer Worlds.Whats Aristonium?asked Ajax.Aristonium is a precious stone that only exists in the Arist system, said Ethan.Its used by the Trade Guild to build GCTDs and other extra dimensional technologies.Scientists believe that part of the stone exists across other spacial dimension.The ore lacks the extradimensional qualities when synthesized in a lab; thats why natural Aristonium is so important to the Epherians and the Trade Guild.Whats Aristonium got to do with us?asked Ajax.The Epherians transport the raw Aristonium ore across the borders of the Epherian Empire in large freighters.They process the ore inside the empire.Before I joined the Out Drifter I worked for the Tunnel Makers, a faction of smugglers.At the time the Tunnel Makers had a deal with the navigators who operate the Aristonium freighters.They smuggled people and ships into the Epherian Empire for a price.How much?asked Michael.Probably a lot more than we can afford, said Ethan.But we may be able to make a deal with them, and remember, I was once a Tunnel Maker.They know me, and maybe I can negotiate a good deal.Where are the Tunnel Makers based?asked Michael.On Bodach Delta, its an ice world.Nasty place, said Ajax.This is a really bad idea.Thats where we have to go if you want to make a deal, said Ethan.Then we will go, said Acacius.Ajax shook his head.Cap, this is crazy.Its got danger painted all over it.Ajax, you know I respect your opinion, and you are a valued crew member, but if you dont want to come on this mission I can drop you off at the next stop.Ajax lowered his eyes.His dry lips turned up at the corners and his weathered face broke into a smile, which looked out of place.Im just saying that its dangerous, Cap.I dont plan on leaving the crew.Good.Its decided.We will go to Bodach Delta and seek out the Tunnel Makers.**  Sara set a course for Bodach Delta.Michael had been silent for some time.His mind was focused on the future and all the possibilities.He stared out through the viewing panel at the vast expanse of space.He had no idea how they would negotiate a deal with the Tunnel Makers.Bodach Delta is a fifteen day trip at full speed.We will come close the alien battle zone, but I think we should be able to avoid any unwanted interruptions, said Sara as she finished programing the navigational computer.We have to stop somewhere along the way to replenish the reactor.Have you searched for suitable locations?She smiled, knowing that Michael knew the answer before he asked the question.Of course.Where are we stopping?There is a moon called Nod 33.Its a former Epherian outpost which was bought by a rich investor and turned into a holiday location.Unfortunately its a little too close to the alien battle zone to attract many tourists.The owner is developing a plan to convert it into a service centre for ships, but with the current expansion of war I dont think the service centre will last more than a few years.Michael smiled across at Sara.We have been through a lot in the last few weeks.Sara, your skills saved our lives.I dont know what I would do without you.You always say that.I mean it, he added.I know you do, Captain.THIRTEEN      A lone figure was standing inside the central dome of the alien fleet command.After their initial incursion into human held systems the aliens had built a main base on a prime world which they seized from the human race.The world was one of six in the Outer Worlds that acted as a base for the alien fleet.The ceiling of the dome was over two hundred metres in height and was made entirely of steel.A single door led into the dome which was perfectly circular.The dark stone floor was polished, and the whole area was lit dimly by florescent particles which floated in the air.Gartax was the only one who had the right to enter the dome and converse with the Master Shadow.He was a tall alien with an oversized cranium and sinewy muscles.His skin was paler than the average alien which had caused him to be a victim of relentless abuse in his early years.He grew up among the ranks of soldiers and gradually hardened, becoming a force to be reckoned with.He had fought his way to the position of Fleet Master over the course of twenty years, and many other ambitious aliens had died or been brutally subdued by his relentless climb to the highest position in the alien hierarchy.I am here, Master Shadow.How can I serve you?he asked, speaking the harsh alien language.A swirling shadow appeared near the height of the dome, and the entire area became so dark that he could hardly see, even with his large orb like eyes which were well adapted to the dark.He was in awe of the power, and raw fear pulsed through his body.The exiles have awoken, howled the voice out of the darkness, and the sound of the voice resonated throughout the dome.Terror tore through his body.He trembled and fell to his knees.Wewe are aware of their presence, he said, covering his eyes with his elongated fingers.They have escaped your grasp twice already.You will find them or you will die!Gartax bowed his head to the ground.Our scouts are searching for their ship.We will locate them soon and when we do we will bring them to you.I have given your race almost half this galaxy; nevertheless, I will take everything away from you in an instant if you fail me.This is far more important than your pitiful war.Find the exiles or I will destroy your race and replace your people with a more agreeable alternative.Gartax lifted his dark orb like eyes and trembled as he gazed up at the swirling shadows directly above.We will not fail you.My commanders will find the exiles.I will bring them to you.**  We are approaching Nod 33, Captain, said Sara.Michael looked out through the viewing panel.He could see the planet Nod, which was a giant red planet made entirely of gas which was in orbit around eclipsing binary stars known as the Merton Brothers.The two stars were in very close orbit around each other; from a distance they had the appearance of a single star.Nod 33 was one of fifty four moons in the orbit of the planet.The moon had been successfully terraformed by the Epherian Empire more than a thousand years earlier.Nod 33 hosted the only major settlement in the system.There were also a few small mining colonies on some inhospitable planets further away from the Merton Brothers.Nod 33 Watchtower; this is the Out Drifter; Interworld code AMB712; mandated by the Outer World Salvage Guild.We request a landing dock and reactor refuelling, said Sara over the external com.There was no reply.Sara glanced at Michael and raised an eyebrow.She waited a few moments and then repeated the request.I have you on our scanners, Out Drifter answered the clear voice of a woman.It is not clear why you would want to land here.Nod 33 has been abandoned.The alien fleet is nearing the system.Alien scout ships flew through the system four days ago.We are expecting an invasion  Abandoned?But youre still down there, said Sara.I am a synthetic android.I work for Nod 33 Customs.I am the last remaining employee in the tower.Almost everything was abandoned in the haste to leave the system.I am not aware of any human beings currently abiding on the moon  Sounds like a salvaging dream, said Ajax, who was standing at the door to the control room.We dont have time to scavenge, said Michael.Are we able to replenish our reactor?asked Sara.The reactor refuelling system is still online replied the android.The payment GCTDs have been removed from the landing docks  We can hack the system with the quantum code breaker, said Sara.Nod 33 watchtower; can you direct us to a landing dock with a reactor replenishment system for an Armorstonian class ship?Dock A, position eighty seven.I will set the navigational signal to guide you to the landing platform  Thank you.**  The Out Drifter descended through the thick upper atmosphere and followed the towers navigational signal to the main landing dock.They could see a small city through the viewing panel which was set between a craggy mountain range and a large lake.The landscape surrounding the city was sparsely filled with tall conifers.This world looks cold.Why was it a tourist destination?asked Michael.It was a rock climbing and mountaineering hub, said Sara.Apparently some of the natural structures are beautiful enough to draw tourists from nearby systems.The 0.75 gravity makes mountaineering activities safer.The owner of the moon had high hopes for his resort and his ship service centre, but it look like the aliens ended those dreams.They flew directly over the empty city.There were no more than a dozen large resort towers, and the vast majority of buildings were smaller residences which followed the shore of the lake.Most of the automated systems were still online, including street lights and robotic street cleaners.The two Merton Brother stars were setting across the lake, which created a bright pink and violet lightshow.The main docking port was situated where the city met the craggy mountains.Sara guided the Out Drifter over the city and descended toward the dock, which consisted of about one hundred open concrete platforms of varying sizes.Each platform had large numbers painted in red.Sara gently landed on their designated platform.Michael slipped out of the co pilot seat and headed for the cargo bay.Acacius was standing near the exit door and speaking with Ajax and Ethan.Cynthia was sitting beside Dog Two.She had recovered enough to come out of deep sleep, but she was still exhausted from the ordeal on Zeno Par.Were going to stop here to replenish the reactor, said Michael.Itll take about an hour.Ethan, I need you to hack the refuelling system.This city has been abandoned.Why was it abandoned?asked Ethan.They were expecting an alien invasion which hasnt yet eventuated.We wont be around long enough to see it arrive.Yeah, thats what we thought on Zeno Par, said Ajax doubtfully.It is a statistical improbability that the alien fleet would arrive in the one hour it would take us to replenish the reactor, said Ivan.Statistical improbabilities dont reflect well in my life experience, said Ajax.Then your life must be exception to the law of probability, said Ivan in dry monotone.It always has been, said Ajax with a hoarse laugh as he opened the exit door and stepped out onto the concrete platform.The air was cold, and the last rays of light were streaming across the docks.About twenty metres away was a refuelling station, which was a large rectangular metal box with a control console and a robotic arm with an attached adjustable fuel pipe.The robotic arm could extend out in many directions and take the refuelling pipe to the ship.Michael and Ethan followed Ajax over to the console.The GCTD had been removed from the controls.Ethan stepped forward with the quantum code breaker.He connected wirelessly to the console and within five seconds had broken the security code.Meanwhile Ajax walked over to the edge of the platform and stared out at the empty city and the large lake beyond.Michael and Acacius walked across to stand beside him.Cap, this whole city is a dream for a salvage crew.There must be thousands of valuable components out there.We should take some time and see what we can find.We do not have time, said Acacius.The End Machine is searching for us as we speak.The shadow is moving throughout the Outer Worlds.We cannot delay our mission.Hmmm, well, its a pity, said Ajax.I hope money doesnt become a problem for us in the future; because youre looking at our one big chance to cash in.The robotic arm of the refuelling system extended out toward the Out Drifter and connected to the reactors fuel outlet, which was situated toward the back of the ship.Michael viewed the ship as the light of day faded away.The scorch marks and dents in the outer hull were much more numerous after the battle on Zeno Par.The ship was beginning to look like a flying wreck.Michael knew that other members of the Outer World Salvage Guild would laugh if they saw the Out Drifter, but he had never cared much about how things looked on the outside.Beautiful, isnt she?asked Ethan with a knowing grin.Its a miracle the outer hull wasnt breached in the last battle.Armorstonian ships are as tough as they get, said Michael with a dash of pride in his voice.Yes, they are tough, but not indestructible, said Ethan.One day the Out Drifter is going to reach its maximum point of endurance.There are multiple ways the ship could meet its final end, and it wont be pretty when that day comes, especially if we are in outer space.I prefer to maintain an optimistic attitude regarding the ship, said Michael under his breath.Ethan shrugged his shoulders and lowered his eyes.Captain, an optimistic attitude has nothing to do with it.It doesnt matter what attitude you have; only repair work will keep the ship flying.These are mechanical issues, not psychological.Michael turned back toward Ajax and Acacius.Cynthia and Dog Two had come out of the ship and were approaching the edge of the platform.Night was falling over the city and a mist was descending on the town from the mountains.It should be morning soon, said Cynthia.I read on the computer that the nights only last three hours on Nod 33.Well be gone before sunrise, said Ajax in a gentler tone than he had previously taken with Cynthia.Im guessing we have about an hour before the reactor is replenished, which gives me some time to look for essentials.Im going to check out some of the abandoned bars in the town.They may have left some bottles behind.You never know what you can find in a ghost city, he said, pointing toward a street that cut away from the docks in the direction of the city centre.He turned toward the dock elevator, which was across at the far side the platform.Dont be longer than an hour, said Michael.Dont worry, Cap.I wont keep you waiting, he replied, stepping into the elevator.Michael turned back to Acacius.He seemed to be in a trance as his eyes scanned the buildings and structures below.There are other human beings here, he said in a low voice.We should rescue them, said Cynthia.No, they wouldnt be stranded, said Michael.This was a wealthy tourist location; they would only be here because they have chosen to stay.Acacius glanced momentarily at Michael.There is much we need to talk about before you face the End Machine.Im ready to talk when you are.The skills you possess have never been fully tested.I can lead you along the path, but only to a point.There are many things in life that must be learned through experience.We do not know if the Lore of the Ancients can defeat the End Machine.The End Machine can easily move between the four spacial dimensions as you and I can.To defeat the machine you must go further.Further?questioned Michael.He had never heard of any dimensions beyond the primary spacial dimensions.Indeed, much further, replied Acacius grimly.**  Ajax returned an hour later with a leather bag full of rare alcoholic beverages.He emptied his bag in the cargo bay and proceeded to examine each bottle.Half of these I havent yet tasted.Look at this one, Ferocious Fire; this is worth at least two thousand credits!And look at this one, Gracious Garnet; this one makes your teeth glow, he remarked with a chuckle.Within the hour the reactor was fully replenished.Ethan also managed to do some repair work on the outer hull.He had welded some metal sheets over areas where the armour and heat shields had almost been breached.The additional metal sheets didnt match the darker underlying colour, and they made the ship look even more like a flying piece of scrap metal.Sara powered up the reactor and lifted the ship off the platform.She scanned the console and checked all the indicators.Everything appeared to be running well.The Out Drifter ascended above the city and flew smoothly toward the upper atmosphere.With the reactor replenishment they could now travel vast distances without having to worry about where to refuel.Michael entered the control room and took the co pilots seat.I have set the course for Bodach Delta.We are fourteen days from arrival at full speed.Michael nodded as he looked down at the control console.I did some research into the Tunnel Makers.Theyre known for their brutality.Well have to be careful.Ethan is not someone who would lead us into a hornets nest.He must have some confidence in the plan, she said.The Tunnel Makers have changed in the last few years.Theyre developed into the most brutal and powerful smuggling outfit in the Outer Worlds.The smuggling trade is a tough business.The industry has been squeezed by the alien expansion; the factions are fighting over an ever shrinking market.Im sure we will be fine, Captain.You have a tough crew, and I think we can handle smugglers.Michael nodded.Youre probably right, Sara.I just prefer to know exactly what we are up against.He looked at the life support console.Thats odd, he said, glancing at Sara.What?she asked casually as she adjusted the reactor stability levels.Why would the life support monitor be reading seven lifeforms?Her eyes darted across to the small digital readout.She stared intensely at the screen and looked puzzled.That cant be right.Let me complete a diagnostic before we jump to any conclusions, she said.Computer, scan the life support software for any bugs or errors.SCANNING: ZERO ERRORS  Computer, how many lifeforms are on board the ship?SEVEN LIFEFORMS AND TWO SYNTHETIC ANDROIDS  Computer, do a scan of the entire ship for all registered and unregistered crew.MICHAEL (CAPTAIN); AJAX (SECURITY); CYNTHIA (UNASSIGNED CREW); ETHAN (MECHANICAL ENGINEER); SARA (PILOT); IVAN (SYNTHETIC ORGANISM); DOG TWO (WEAPONISED SYNTHETIC ORGANISM); ACACIUS TRIFON (UNASSIGNED CREW); UNREGISTERED LIFEFORM.Computer, what is the unregistered lifeform?HUMAN, MALE  Locate the unregistered lifeform.CARGO BAY AREA, SPECIFIC LOCATION UNKNOWN  Someone is hiding on our ship, she said in a low voice.Michael stood up and drew his plasma pistol.He stepped out of the control room.Sara drew her pistol and followed Michael to the living room where Ajax, who had clearly had too much to drink, was arguing with Ivan about whether androids could ever be considered equal to human beings.Dog Two was sitting beside the table and watching the argument, and Acacius was sitting cross legged in the corner of the room and appeared to be in a deep trance.He opened his eyes as Michael walked into the room.Michael interrupted.I think we have a problem.Damn right we have a problem, yelled Ajax, his face crimson red.Ivan thinks machines should be given human rights throughout the galaxy.Not on my watch!I wont ever think of a robot as my equal, not now, never!Dog Two snarled.Ajaxs lips curled into a vicious sneer.Dont yap at me you sad excuse for a dog!There is nothing more special about you than a food synthesizer or a washing machine!Dog Two bared his razor sharp teeth and growled.Silence!yelled Michael.We have a real problem.The computer has identified an infiltrator.Theres someone on the ship.Ajax froze.How could someone come aboard without us knowing?he asked.I dont know how, but they are hiding in the cargo bay.The life support monitor is reading an extra person.Wheres Cynthia?asked Ajax.Shes with Ethan in the engine room, said Sara.Then what are we waiting for, said Ajax.He quickly put down his bottle and reached for his rifle, which was propped up beside him.Ivan drew his pistol, and Dog Two began to growl.Michael led the way through the central corridor.The others followed closely behind.They reached the cargo bay and stopped to scan the area before stepping in, but they couldnt see anyone.Ajax brushed by and walked over to where the sleeping pods were lined up against the wall.He turned around and shook his head.Nothing, Cap.Theres no one here.Cynthia and Ethan entered the cargo bay from the engine room door at the back.Whats going on?asked Ethan.Acacius stepped into the cargo bay from the corridor.He stood still for a moment, closed his eyes, and concentrated.I perceive there is a stranger here.He is listening to us.Acacius turned to face the opposite wall.There was an area where the wall cladding looked stained and a little corroded.Show yourself.The wall seemed to shimmer, and a second later the optical illusion dissipated.A short, bedraggled and skinny man with unkempt grey hair appeared out of nowhere.His face was deeply lined and unshaven.He was wearing a long synthetic cloak.Nano cloak!yelled Ajax as he pointed his rifle at the infiltrator.The man fell to his knees and cowered against the wall.Please dont kill me.I. ..I mean you no harm.Please!His frightened blue eyes stared up at the crew.Michael had seen nano cloaks before, but he had never seen one of such high quality.Nano cloaks were made of a material consisting of millions of small luminous nano bots which could produce light to mimic the surroundings and hide the wearer from sight.Who are you and what do you want?asked Michael as put his pistol away.The stranger was unarmed and didnt appear to be carrying any weapons.My name is Gopher.You sure weaselled your way in here!said Ajax, who was still pointing his rifle at the stranger.I didnt expect you to discover my hiding place.I was planning to leave at the next stop.Im a citizen of Nod 33.I was stranded on the planet after everyone left.I was left alone.Do you understand what its like to be completely alone and waiting for an alien invasion?There was no chance of survival.When I saw you land I decided to take the opportunity to escape.That makes no sense, said Sara.Nod 33 was a billionaires retreat.They wouldnt be short of any transport ships, and they wouldnt leave a citizen unless they wanted you to be left behind.You could have asked for our help before sneaking aboard.I was stranded, and I was certain you would turn me away if I requested your help.I had to take a chance.Please understand; Im a desperate man.We should help him, said Cynthia.We can at least take him to the next stop.Hes lying, said Acacius.Ajaxs eyes narrowed.He stepped forward and snarled down at Gopher.Do you take us for fools?he asked, pointing his rifle directly at the infiltrator.No, replied Gopher in a trembling voice as he shrank back even further.Gopher, you should tell us the truth if you want our help, said Michael calmly.Why give him a chance to explain himself, Cap?Hes already lied to us.Lets put him in an escape pod and launch him at an alien occupied world.Please, no!whined Gopher, the blood draining from his face.Why not?asked Ajax, his face as hard as concrete.Okay!Okay, stammered Gopher.Ill tell you the truth.Ill tell you everything.Ajax reached down and grabbed Gopher by the scruff of the neck and lifted him off the ground.I am a professional thief.My speciality is precious gemstones, he whispered, gasping for air.I was working on a major job on Nod 33, but everything fell apart and I found myself behind bars.I spent a month in prison; thats why I was left behind on the moon.They dont make extra space for thieves on billionaire ships.The prison guards were kind enough to open my cell and give me back my belongings before the last ship took off.I was stranded.We should definitely eject him, said Ajax, nodding resolutely.Im sorry, Gopher.We dont have extra space for thieves on our ship either.Ajax started to drag Gopher across the cargo bay to the escape pods, which were situated behind a removable panel on the opposite side of the room.Gopher struggled, but he was no match for Ajaxs brute strength.Please, no, I told you the truth, please!pleaded Gopher.Ajax, wait, said Michael.He just admitted hes a thief, Cap, said Ajax, raising an eyebrow.That doesnt mean he should die, said Cynthia.Ajax lowered his eyes and nodded.All right, I agree with you, but what are we going to do with him.We cant keep him on board the Out Drifter.You cant trust thieves; I know from experience.You have nothing to worry about; I only steal valuable gemstones, and I doubt you have any on your ship, said Gopher.If you could be so kind to let me off at the next stop I will never bother you again.Please dont send me to the aliens.You have no reason to send me to my death.I havent stolen anything from you.You tried to steal a ride, growled Ajax.Its not stealing, argued Gopher.Yes it is, snapped Ajax.Gopher lowered his eyes.Michael pondered the best course of action.He didnt want to eject the man, even though he knew it was the regular way most crews dealt with uninvited guests, but at the same time he knew Ajax was right; thieves could not be trusted.In Michaels opinion there was only one solution.All right, we wont eject you, but you have to stay in deep sleep for the whole trip.Well drop you off at our next destination.The whole trip?questioned Gopher.You can choose either deep sleep or Ajaxs idea of launching you at an alien occupied world, said Michael.Okay, fine.Ill sleep for the entire trip.Do you mind if I ask where we are going?Bodach Delta, said Sara.Gophers face became deathly pale and his eyes glazed over for a moment.Bodach Delta!Why would you go there?he asked in a low and trembling voice.Important business, said Michael.Ajax, set up a sleeping pod for our guest, and lock his pod on the outside.Consider it done.FOURTEEN      Michael awoke from deep sleep as the glass cover slid off his sleeping pod.Ivan was standing beside him.He felt the blood returning to his hands.We are five hours from Bodach Delta, said Ivan.How is the Out Drifter performing?he asked in a sleepy voice.The ship is fully operational.Ethan has identified a minor leak in one of the oxygen tanks which he will be able to repair after we land.Every other system is functioning normally.Michael sat up and stepped out of his sleeping pod.How are you, Ivan?Im functioning normally, Captain.Have you fixed the broken jetpack yet?I cannot correctly identify the underlying cause of the malfunction.The jetpack should be operational.But it doesnt work.Correct.Well.You gave it a good try, said Michael.It is a puzzle.I believe it is just a matter of identifying the cause.Michael nodded in agreement.Keep up the good work, Ivan.Yes, Captain.Michael walked down to the control room.Sara glanced over her shoulder.How did you sleep?You know what those sleeping pods are like.Thats why I try to avoid them as much as possible.You know there are advanced sleeping pods that dont leave you feeling like a zombie when you wake up.Oh, you mean the upmarket sleeping pods that millionaires can afford, said Michael with a cheeky grin.Thats right.I guess we can only dream of such luxuries, she said with a laugh.Ivan said we are nearly at Bodach Delta.We are still a few hours out.Have you identified where the Tunnel Makers base is?he asked.Ethan will help with our first contact.The Tunnel Makers own a small town, which was once a gold mining colony when the Epherian Empire governed the planet.Their base is situated inside the old mine beneath the mountain which is adjacent to the town.They live underground in tunnels, hence the name, Tunnel Makers.If we didnt have Ethan on crew I would suggest staying away from Bodach Delta.The place is a criminal hotbed, a cesspool of depravity and violence.Ethan seems to think we will be safe; he believes he carries a certain level of respect among the Tunnel Makers, but I dont think we should let our guard down.Let me show you a picture of the planet.A shimmering image of Bodach Delta appeared above the holographic panel.The planet was entirely covered in ice.It looked like a white globe floating in space.
