The skin was the color of beige, a protruding nose portion, as a tapirs, but the whole event was dominated by the alien eyes: Eyes that were large and very black.As dark crystals in the dusk light, open to the cosmic drama.Mandal fired and hit the enemy.In a cosmic quiver, very lax, the plasma charge was released and sent a shock wave of light on Mandals retina.The dawn had come.One hand of the enemy was torn away and fell down on the floor.The organic machine retreated and disappeared through the window.Mandal was beside himself with terror.The legs shook from mental exhaustion.Now, the day was felt.Light entered through the open loop hole that sent cold winds against the caretaker.He went to the aluminum ladder that led up to the control station.He groped his way up, sat down in the black leather seat and took control of the working machine.Nimrod 3 started with a roar.The murmuring nuclear engine got the oiled caterpillar bands to spin.Mandal looked up to heaven where he saw Aqua 6 in all its glory: The blue planet passed by and soon the day became dusk.Other shards from Aquatica spun around the horizon.Nimrod 3 moved toward a landing site: A gate between Aquatica and Aqua 6.There was a spacecraft there.Mandal operated Nimrod 3 in a state of great confusion.He didnt know what he was dealing with.The mini planet was lost.What was the real purpose of the life form?Why had it planted plants for an unknown reason, only to discard the result?The machine stayed in the vicinity of the landing site.Mandal went down the aluminum ladder, trembled in his legs, and decided to do something drastic: He would lose the link gear at its adjustable mounting points, bring it, then bring up the exploder and venture out into the open.Hed run the short distance between Nimrod 3 and the landing site.There he would fire some plasma charges and go into the spaceship.The link equipment would be used in case the enemy was waiting on the way.He would go into the spaceship.Then he would activate the space drive and fly to Aqua 6.Mandal opened the door to the lawn outside.Darkness prevailed.He crept across the lawn, looked about, but saw no enemy.He started to run.Suddenly a green beam cut through the air and Mandal was hit.Mandal tried to get up but he couldnt.He leaned forward and saw that his right leg was gone.He felt no pain.The shock was complete and he began to lose consciousness.So he activated the link gear.The second robot came to life out of dormancy.It was a horrible state of great pain but simultaneously the only thing that made life possible.The robot rose from the grave, broke down the ladder and ran to Mandals body.The robot looked around.The day dawned and he could see the outskirts of Aqua 6.The enemy came floating through the air.The robot bent over Mandals body, grabbed hold of it and started to run.The enemy fired beams of light through the air and hit the robot.The shock was powerful and the metal skeleton fell to the ground.The robot felt his way across the grass.The landing site loomed twenty five meters away.But now the enemy stayed close to the robot and his controller.He picked up the exploder and threw it away, with a controlled movement of the arm.He was not furious.He resembled a futuristic creation of sublime nature: No criminal, no gardener, but a cursed spirit moving away from the structure of the universe.Mandal was lost but held on to the only thing he had: His life as a gardener, an immortalized spirit, now on the road to perdition.The robot searched further in the grass.The enemy stood still, watched the spectacle: The gardener who found his temporary salvation in his metallic helper.But he was not only carried by him.He was the controller who controlled his helper and also himself.Mandal was losing consciousness.The pain in the remains of the right leg burned deep into the wounds of his soul.He was the gardener.He was the successor to the human failure.He was the remains of the past and no longer human.The Veil of the Pentagram      The journey      It hovered in empty space, suspended by space time, in a hub of invisible forces.It was no ordinary asteroid.It had been floating in space for eons, undiscovered by science.Trent and Amy climbed on the slippery rock.Now they were one with the celestial body, and the ice that was upon it.The marvelous thing was that they ended up in this sector, far removed from earth, far away from the established colony.Gravity existed, but it was very weak.They had to use fixtures anchored in the rock.When they found the pieces, they crawled over the rough surface to an icy area where they dug a cave in the ice.They would spend the night in the cave.They lit a fire of glowing green energy fragments, which they acquired on the colony.These energy fragments got the white ice to shine, and revealed dirt particles.What they found was what they expected: Different fragments of porous rock.Ice cubes with dirt particles.Scientists had long searched for the origins of life.They had explored worlds with organic life.This life was very similar to earth life: The same basic cellular structure.The same form of DNA, RNA, cell membranes...They no longer believed in the old theories about human specificity.It was believed in panspermia   that life on Earth and other colonies came from outside: From genetic material, although this would be simple in nature.The new theory was that this material came from celestial bodies that floated through space, plunged into the planets and made evolution possible      * * *      Trent and Amy were freethinkers.They came from the same place, in terms of ideas.
