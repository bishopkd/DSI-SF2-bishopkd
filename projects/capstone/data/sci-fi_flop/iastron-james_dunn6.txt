He couldn't.Then he heard it.A chilling rattle.A shadow loomed.And with it came a cold, gut wrenching hiss.* * *  Stopped dead in his tracks, Araman Alwars mouth dropped and he fell to his knees.Through the tall hangar casement he could see the dark body of the Nyx drifting slowly away from the station.The only way off his nightmare was going, disappearing right in front of him.And there was nothing he could do to stop it.In his reflection Araman watched a tear run down the flushing contours of his face.Stunned and expressionless, he followed the ship as it raced away.Very quickly, however, the Nyx began to move strangely, thrusters pouring from every point, tilting its face from one direction to another, until it began to descend.The wrong way.Down towards the lightning planet below.Heaven help him, Araman uttered, standing slowly.Sir ...Sir!A voice from nearby tore him from his bewildered state.Private Riess stumbled over, blood trickling down his temple.Carlos, he said, happy to see another person alive.What happened to the ship?Lesper was here.Knocked me out with my own w ...weapon.The pain was visible across his face.Lesper took the ship?Yes ...Yes, sir.Araman looked back out at the distant craft.He was numb, unable to think straight.Theres a creature in here with us, Carlos.Theres something you need to know.Well, whatever it is, Im p ...pretty sure it got on the Nyx with him.And if so, he got what he deserved!The Nyx was now so far away.There was no doubt where Lesper was going to finish up.Wheres everyone else?Araman asked.All I could hear were screams down that way, Riess said, pointing to Section Four.In that case theres more than one, because one of them got Pine and Azal, and it almost had me.We need to contact Captain Justus on the Chaos.It's the only other ship able to help us now.Communications, then.Riess ignited his coil and moved away.But Araman stopped to take one last look back at the Nyx as it disappeared into the violent haze of Tempest Beta, a tiny dot in a milieu of miraculous spectacle.* * *  The Battle of Aurora was over.Antal Justus gazed out of the anterior casement of the Fated Chaos bridge as one hundred seemingly silent explosions tore outpost Aurora, along with all of the connected vessels, into one million pieces of slowly drifting metal.The fire engulfed any trace of the incident and the attackers identities.Were free to make the leap, Captain, his pilot informed him.Justus couldnt reply.He sighed and looked away.Do we go?Captain?Captain Justus?No, Justus said.It had hit him from nowhere.What have I done?Are we not returning to Erebus Station?Justus breathed in, then out, his heart thumping in his temples.Of course we are, he said.But at once the lights went out.Panicked voices filled the bridge and the Fated Chaos emergency lighting, blood red, kicked in.Captain!the pilot cried.Whats going on?Weve taken damage from the explosion.Its not good!Captain, what do we do?But Justus did not care.An overwhelming part of him was horrified, irate at what he had just done.Perhaps being trapped at the edge of space was what he deserved.Perhaps he could put it right.But as the alarm sounded, his men in panic, and his captives locked away onboard he realised it was far, far too late for remorse.Fifty      Four days after the liberation of Rotavar, the crew of the Crimson Flux had, unsurprisingly, already found itself in a similarly precarious position.The Martian Colony upon Mars, fourth world of the system Sol, was known for its violence, gangs, and criminal lords.The Martian Act of 4000 had removed Alignment regulation of the red planet, meaning its reputation, which hadnt been solid at the outset, had fast gone down from that point on.In the region of Tharsis, on the borders of the Black Markets of Mars, stood a sturdy little inn.Upon a table inside that sturdy little inn, Adra Dimal snatched a sip of her brim full flagon and looked intently upon her small crew.The three before her each, in turn, stared back, attentive and tacitfor the most part.Everyone have their weapons?she asked.Check.Weapons, Noah?Yes, yes.Check.Comms?Double check.Ahem ...comms?What?Noah, youre not even listening!I am too!Dimal slammed her pint down on the table between them, causing froth to shoot up and scatter between the several surrounding tables.No, youre not.Youre sat staring into your brew like a bleedin toddler!Noah scoffed and went to say something, but took so long thinking of a retort that he gave up altogether, and returned to sulking in the corner of the four.Right, Dimal said.Rolling her eyes at her childlike medic she stared across the small table at Raj and Shree.The former leaned forward energetically while his larger sister bowed down so as to avoid burning the top of her purple feathered hat on the light hanging above; her legs were positioned uncomfortably close to her stomach and she looked genuinely unhappy.Remind us again, Capn, Raj said.What did the message say?She cleared her throat and leaned in.He was of course talking about the communication theyd received on the journey from Rotavar to Earth.After the rather uneventful retreat of all Crilshan forces from the desert planet, the crew and their guest, Aron Veryan, had set off without waiting, and headed for the safety of Earth.It was only as they had passed the asteroid belt between Jupiter and Mars that the communication came through.In a word, it said the Captains in danger.Justus?I guess so.Crikey!What else?It said were the only ones what can help, and if we want to see him again weve to meet the messenger here on the Martian Colony.It didnt say exactly where  And did it occur to either of you three that it could just be another trap?Noah said.Hell knows weve fallen for enough of them!The three glared at him and he retreated back to his corner, mumbling to himself about how much he hated it there.He took a huge mouthful of his own drink and spilled most of it down his shirt.Of course everybody now grouped around the table had considered the possibility that the message was a decoy aimed at leading the crew down there with intent to ambush them.The Flux had made plenty of enemies in its time, after all.But each one, and even Noah to the slightest extent, was willing to take that risk if it meant getting their captain back.He was, and had always been, their leader and friend.Im going to the puddle, Noah said, standing, but Raj set a strong hand on his shoulder and forced him back down.What do you think youre  A loud and timely thud.They all turned toward the open door of the hostelry.Noah swore under his breath and almost fell beneath the table.Shree, who had taken quite a shine to the balding medic, reached across and propped him up.Raj tilted closer to Dimal and she watched his hand extend to his pistol; shed already clutched hers.The taverns dense door slammed closed behind three enormous Crilshan soldiers, each with deadly blades in hand and grimaces to match.Their dark eyes were exposed and blood stained garments, body length, dragged along the floor.Obviously drunk, the foremost trudged up to the bar where several old and battered men sat, silent and petrified.The Crilshan picked up one of the mens jugs and glugged the brew in one.He then slammed the jug down and stared at the drinks owner.Your flagon?the Crilshan asked.Uh ...y ...yeah.Tut tut.Didnt feel like fighting me for it?N ...uh ...no.Well that wont do!The dark eyed brute raised his blade and with immense might severed the old mans arm.He shrieked in agony as the thug twisted the knife edge and in one motion took off his head.It landed on the bar, before rolling off and across the floor towards the Fluxs table.Screams filled the bar and Dimal brought her shaking hand to her mouth.The Crilshan gazed at them all with a smile as his subordinates overturned nearby tables.Youre knifed if you do, youre knifed if you dont!he cried.Dimal turned her head and locked eyes with Raj.Do you have any of your grenades with you?she whispered.Raj breathed steady and nodded twice.One of the Crilshans slammed his fist into the face of a haggard looking old woman.Shree made a brash clatter as she clutched Noah close, and the Crilshans head shot in their direction.On my count, she mouthed, one ...two  Whoa!Dimal, watch out!She ducked as the bright red light of a blaster rifle connected with the wall, inches above her head.Raj pulled out his pistol and aimed it at the creature responsible.No!Dimal shouted to the Crilshans.We dont want trouble!Another burst of red light missed Shree by centimetres, smashing the light above her head and shattering glass over the four.On second thoughts She pulled out her own blaster and shot the Crilshan square in the chest.One blue flash and he dropped to the ground, smoking.Raj Timbur pulled a grenade from his belt.Over ere you gotch gutted slime sack!And he threw it at the nearest Crilshan, who replied by raising his blade and parrying the palm sized fragment of metal.It shattered in a cloud of nauseating gas.* * *  This place is rough!Raj said as the four hurried from the back exit of the bar, coughing and laughing and moving quickly through bustling gangs of unusual people.Scuffles broke out all around them, but it appeared, from the reactions of everybody else, that it wasnt uncommon.Shame, Noah muttered from the middle of the group.What are the chances of visiting the Valles Marineris while were here, Adra?Is it a bar?No, its  Then no.Fine, he said with a grunt.I dont see whats wrong with a little culture, but fine ...fine!Dimal ignored Noahs grumbling.Raj leaned over her shoulder with a smirk.Close escape there, he said.I didnt know that lot ventured into this System.They dont, she said, keeping her head down and moving through a crowd of blaster trading clergy women.Or at least they havent until now.This is dangerous.They shouldnt be here ...and neither should we.The sooner they heard what the mysterious fellow had to say, the quicker they could get away and head to Earth.Theyd left Aron Veryan inside the securely bayed Flux, and even though she trusted her, Dimal nevertheless wished to return to the ship as soon as possible.She looked up, glimpsing the motionless stars through the reinforced caging which at that very moment held air and warmth inside and kept cold and death out.Shaking her head Dimal focused herself; she knew she had to keep her wits about her, had to have a clear head.It could just as easily be a trap as much as an urgent proposal.Mars largest volcano, Olympus Mons, was something of a tourist destination and so acted as a magnet to entrepreneurs and dirty dealers.According to Noah, who hadnt shut up about it since the strangers message had arrived, Olympus Mons was surrounded by a region known as Tharsis; the locality was less cratered, but suffered from geological activity.They had, therefore, not left the Flux too far back.Noah did have his uses, even if they were pointless most of the time.The crowded pathways they now passed through were made up of small, semicircular tunnels which fast became teeming with impatient bodies.Entering the next section of the base they found themselves surrounded by great tents and multicoloured stalls of men and women screaming at them wildly.It would have been quite a shock for anyone that hadnt encountered a Black Market before.Stomach turning lights flashed and flickered in a dizzying dance of movement.Noah, tottering in the middle of the four, might have collapsed to the ground in a whimpering grand mal had his huge crewmate behind not seized him by the collar and, lifting him off his feet, carted him through the terrifying crowd of criminals and thieves.The curious assembly of crooks wore dark robes and costumes, and displayed scowls and grimaces which would have frightened a child to death.What kind of man would choose to meet in a place like this?Someone like Justus, she quickly reminded herself.She smiled at the thought, recalling the man she longed to see again, and tripping over a small form trapped between her and the horde ahead.She lifted the young, red haired girl and realised who it was.Aron?!I said to stay on the ship!I know, I know!Aron Veryan cried back, staring at the many black booths surrounding them.I just wanted to see!Raj, noticing her too, took her arm and hid her behind Dimal.Aron!he said sternly.Akhhh I know, I know!she said again.What is it?Noah called out, still hanging from Shrees meaty hands.Aron!Akhhh!She folded her arms.I want to stay with you!Dimal started moving again.You cant, she said.Its too danger A small lapse of awareness was all it took to stride headlong into a large vessel of a man, who immediately veered around and gazed down upon her.And there was no mistaking those unnatural, eerie dark eyes.Red on black.Ex ...Excuse me, she said, recognising the intoxicated Crilshan from the bar and the danger they were all now in.She smiled widely, revealing white teeth behind rose red lipstick.No, he said, his deep voice lost in the tumult of the room, I dont think I will.He gripped her neck, raising her off the ground.Oh, no?she choked, loosing from her belt an electric prod and ramming it into his exposed rib cage.He didnt drop her, though he grimaced in pain and gripped her neck tighter.Behind her the others had realised what was happening.Raj pushed Aron behind him as he, Noah, and Shree took out their weapons, aiming them at the Crilshan.But the crew of the Flux had learnt way back that the words easy and confrontation never went hand in hand when it came to themthis occasion was no exception.From behind the giant now holding their captain by the throat there emerged several more bladed Crilshans, coil tips gleaming in the fluorescent light.Dimal fought his throttlehold, her legs kicking wildly.Do something!Do something quick!Think!What would Justus do?She gritted her teeth as his stranglehold became unbearable.Thats it!She swung her leg out, knocking him between the legs.He cringed.She bit down, sinking her teeth into his arm as hard as she could; she heard him cry out in pain, and felt herself launched far across the room.Down into darkness.* * *  Dimal jerked herself awake and shot to her feet, no idea how long shed been out cold.She could see the darkness above, filled with glowing lights.As she came around she saw that she was stood in the middle of a small pavilion somewhere near the edge of the large market roomjudging from the height of the ceiling above through the hole in the canvas.She shook her legs alive and pulled out her comm, attempting to call the others.Moments passed before Rajs panting voice answered.Dimal, youre alive!Where ...are you?In the middle of some grubby little tent, she said.Im not hurt, strangely.Thatll be the deficient gravity, Noah added over the comm.Its only  Oh shurrup!Raj said.You lost our red eyed friends?Yup, we lost em ...I think.Everyone okay?Yup!Shree took out half of em on her own.Arons got a fair fist on her!But the huge guy, he got away.Looking for us right now.Oh, and Noahs gone and got himself shot.What?Got shot!Got shot!Noahs infuriated voice appeared on the other end again.I didnt do this to myself for pity sake!You okay?she asked.Ill live.I need to get back to the Flux though.Right away.Of course.Where are you?In the middle of it all, Raj answered.Near the almuit enclosure.Man those things look nasty!Its a good job Justus aint here with ushe hates em.Stay where you are, she said.Ill make my way to you as soon as I find my bearings.Right you are, Capn.And he was gone.The noise of the market was overwhelming, though a little calmer in the tent.She waited and gathered her thoughts.Without Justus she felt so alone.Hed taught her everything she knew, rescued her from a trivial life in which she was worth nothing.And now youre gone, she said.But Id do anything to get you back.Would you really?She twisted round in the dark of the tent.A figure stood in the shadows.What?I said would you really do anything to get him back?The voice spoke softly.It was a man.Whore you?A frail old figure dawdled forwards, clad in intricately woven garments of dark red, blue, and gold; he didnt look dangerous, and yet Dimal sensed he was capable of more than it would seem.He was tall and bent over in the small marquee, a slight silver beard covering his thin neck.The old man teetered closer.He looked at her kindly and smiled, then said, I know you miss him, Adra, but to get Antal Justus back it will take all of your strength, courage, and resolve.How  Now stay calm.Take a seat, Adra.He offered her over to the small metal stool nearby.She sat down warily and watched the old man move across the pavilion to light a small bright beam.As the tent filled in its glow, he dragged another stool over and perched himself upon it.How do you know my name?she asked, examining his elderly features and diminishing silver hair.Who are you?Right now its safer if I dont tell you my name, he said.Know only that I wish to help.Many lives are at stake, not only your own or Antals.How do you know so much?You cant possibly be  Reading your mind?Dont be silly.Then how?He smiled.You wouldnt believe me if I told you.Dont joke!He raised his large eyebrows.Look, I called you here because we both know you want the man you love back.And he wants to return to you, trust me he does.But hes about to face a greater danger than any of you could imagine.It was you that called us here?How do you know all this?she asked, leaning towards the old man.Because, he said, all of this is bigger than you know.There are many more players and the stakes are a lot higher than anybody realises, especially Antal.Hes in deep.He paused, thoughtfully.But I think that is where he is meant to be.Who are you?He cant do it alone.He needs you, Adra.More than you or he could ever know.Who are you?she repeated.Why do you want to help us?He sighed, and said, War is coming, Adra.War which engulf all the Systems, and all of humankind.It is beginning right now, below Crilshar.And everything will soon fall apart.How do you know?I need Antal.We all do.For what?Im not sure.Well thats really helpful!Now listen, he said, reaching for her hand, we are very short on time, and Antal is so very far away.But there is a way you can help him.Fifty One      Ruben Berenguer knew much of the galaxy.He had studied at the greatest institute in the entire Four Systems and been tutored by the last known living Istron.By anyones estimation, if there were a person well resourced to deal with the threat facing humanity, it was he.But, no.There had always been somebody else ...Ruben knew virtually nothing of the legendary Master, Peter Marx, save what Callista had told himand even that was little.It had been some seven hundred years since Peter Marx founded the Istron Society.Seven hundred years of relative stability in the emerging Systemal Alignment.Seven hundred years of miracles and marvels.But humanitys greatest weakness had destroyed that too.Peter Marx had a gift.How and from where, Callista said he would never reveal.But he had chosen to share that gift; an echoing miracle which had brought about a new age.Once more, humanitys fear destroyed it.Men, women, and children on every world and moon treated the Istrons as second class citizens, not even human; they persecuted and hunted them.It was for that reason that Peter took his people and built for them a haven.Europa.Below the moon the Istrons lived, for two hundred yearssafe, misunderstood, but still powerful.Very powerful.So powerful they ripped themselves apart.Callista had survived.And so had Peter.So where was he now?Callista needed him.They all did.Perhaps he had abandoned them, like he had abandoned Callista all those years ago.Peter Marx, the man who never aged and could not die ......where are you now?* * *  Hows she doing?The same as yesterday, Rubens physician told him as they walked along the pure white hospital corridor.The same as the day before.And the same as the one before that.Its like her bodys frozen.Ive seen nothing like it in all my years.The two passed through a guarded entrance to the ward, walked past rows of empty beds, and stopped.Ruben looked down at Callista.The chances of her waking?Today, tomorrow, next week, or never.He closed his eyes.Thank you.Id like some time alone with her.Of course, General.The physician left the two in silence.For two weeks she had lay in her bed, sometimes silent and others calling out as though she were trapped in a desperate nightmare, unable to be woken by voice or by drug.Her nurses had been with her as long as they could spare, but it was Ruben Berenguer that had been at her bedside for what seemed like her whole stay, holding her hand and tripling the Guard at her door.His own encounter with death had not gone the way hed expected; he had survived for a start.All had been verging on the abyss when he found Callista unconscious in her dorm following the Istrons own brush with the dark reaper, but his helpless words had ignited a fire within her mind and she was able to stop the blast left behind for her.And as for the targeted Surrogate Sun, no Crilshan army or group of accomplished assassins had ever before been able to breach the security surrounding its defences.It seemed much like a gift of fortune that their attack was nothing more than a distraction; they had never intended to destroy the Twelve Cities.But that is what perturbed Ruben the most, for Crilshar wished to destroy Titan, and yet at their greatest chance turned it down.Why not simply plant a real bomb there and have done with it?Though it had only been days since he had learned of his nieces safety onboard the Stellarstream, and the woeful loss of Jon Deloueste, worse news was yet to come.He had agreed to allow the resupplying of another Titanese vessel by Captain Ferrantis ship at the far outpost Aurora because there was no choice.Not if he wanted to maintain the Titanese presence in the farthest planetary systems.But when word reached him of the attack and the subsequent loss of communication with both Aurora and his two vessels, nothing could curb the anger or the sorrow which gripped him.Holding his head in one hand while the other clutched Callistas, he finally broke down.I dont know what to do, he said, leaning into his lap like it would contain his grief.It did not.Ive lost everybody.If you all passed on and I could see your bodies before me, then that would be loss I could eventually recognise.But ...But losing my little brother ...out there ...who knows what those monsters did to him?And you, you old crow!Trust you to leave me on my own, while of all the things to do, you sleep!From his pocket he pulled the silver necklace hed left for Anna, found on the table in his apartment, and he rubbed the dark stone at its head between his thumb and forefinger as though it would grant him magnificent strength or power over life and death.Again it did not.But my girls, he said.My Glana, my Anna ...hell only knows where they are.In my heart I know that Crilshar is responsible.And I know what I would have to do to get them back.Only, Im afraid this time I wont be able to do it.Under your guidance Ive done things I never thought possible.But time and time again Ive lost and not been able to say goodbye.I dont want to let you go, Callista ...I cant let you go ...I wont.Why the old Istron hadnt died, nobody knew.The same injection forced upon her had killed Lady Maxim Pinzn.The committed doctors and medical professionals put it down to her superior biology, as no other solid reason could be found.So as Maxim lay cold in her dark crypt, Callistas soul verged on the precipice of life itself.I have to ask you something, he said, knowing what little chance there was that she could hear him.Slowly he unfolded and placed a sheet of singed paper onto the bed.Upon it was drawn the image of a black sphere, burning like evil fire.What truly terrified him, however, was the addition of a young girl stood before the sphere, enveloped in white flame.I found this in the corner of your dorm, he said.Did you dream this?You told me Anna was in danger.I didnt listen.Please ...answer me.This is Anna.What does it mean?Turning the paper over he looked upon the other side.Written, again and again, was a word hed heard before from his nieces: Gilaxiad ...Gilaxiad ...Gilaxiad.Nevertheless, what truly horrified the General was the word Gilaxiad surrounded.Written in the middle of the page, circled in black charcoal, was the word Erebus.What were you trying to tell me, Callista?Callista didnt reply.She couldnt.He had to solve it alone.General?He looked up.General Berenguer?Footsteps sounded behind him.He wiped his eyes on his sleeve, took the cursed paper from her bed, cleared his throat, and turned to stand.He recognised the face of the intruder at once.You!he cried.Yes, sir, replied the visitor, saluting.Weve met.My name is Aleksey Vasily.Fifty Two      Not a word was spoken as the general and the chief made their way from the hospital, through the central citys streets, and eventually to Rubens home.It was empty and quiet and cold.In there!Go!Ruben hurried the young chief through.He turned to a bookcase between the entrance corridor and the living space, and pushed it on its hinges until a small corridor, clean and intact, was revealed.At the edge of the corridor lay a dead end.Ruben watched Chief Vasily, unable to recognise an ally or an enemy.He led him down.General Ruben Berenguer Azar de la Pea, the General spoke, and the metal wall moved inward.They both entered in silence.Vasily stared in awe at the vault, while Ruben walked to the other end of the room and spun.What do you have to show me, Chief?he asked, patience a luxury of the past.Vasily, slightly taken aback, reached into his emerald overcoat and pulled out an envelope.He hesitated, looking down at it, before holding it out.Ruben took the envelope and read his own name on one side, the R circled insignia of the prime ministerial office of Rotavar sealing the opening on the other.You havent opened it?he asked.No, General.To do so would violate the laws of my people and disrespect the memory of my lord.So Edgar is dead then?Im ...Im afraid so, s ...sir.Tears welled up in his eyes as he looked away.The General sat down at the table, cracked the seal, and took out the letter inside.Vasily stood nearby, watching as Ruben discovered the message, written in Rovaa, left for him by his old friend:    My good friend and most venerable ally, General Ruben Berenguer,      If I told you I had been writing this letter for the past six days it would be yet another lie among thousands.The truth is I have been writing this for many years.And even now I cannot for the life of me decide on words that are fitting for what I wish to say.I complete this now, only because word has reached me of the Crilshan fleet descending towards my home.If you are reading this letter it will be within one of two contexts.Either it follows my sudden death or my unexpected absence from Rotavar; for those are the only two fates I may now endure.Once more I write this with much remorse and regret.I have done both my world and yours a disservice and my only hope is that this letter arrives with you in time for something to be done.I shall start from the beginning, but hope that the information I give you leaves you with a much fuller and more hopeful picture than I myself have been left with.My heart tells me that I was never meant to be the thirty fifth Prime Minister of Rotavar, nor a man with any such power.Command is a curse I would gladly surrender, but there is one that will not let it be so.My great master, the powerful Cronat, returned to me some time ago after many years apart.It is because of him that I am where I am.Though, my allegiance to him has withered, my friendship with Titan become more than I hoped it would be.I am afraid to say that I told my Cronat of the Baren Igoth and he now plans not only on destroying the Council and Titan, but you yourself along with the entire Systemal Alignment.My master calls himself the Cronat only to hide his true identity.Cronat, in an old tongue long forgotten, means the Self Crowned, for he believes himself to be appointed by something greater than us.His true name is Lord Malizar.Ruben breathed in deep, releasing the lungful slowly.So hed been correct about Edgar Mokrikovs dealings.He had never heard of the Cronat, however, nor any man named Malizar.It sounded as though such a man was linked to Crilshar.But how did it fit?He continued reading ...I know there have been renewed rumours of the Weapon to Destroy Worlds.My investigations into this matter are extensive, and I have gathered a forceful case.After much examination I myself suffer no doubt that the weapon exists, and I implore you to discover its whereabouts, before my Cronat does so.Because if he already has then I pray you have the strength to stand firm in the face of the perpetual darkness that will inevitably follow.In these dark times I am doubtful this letter will reach you safely, and therefore I am loath to reveal within it the greatest horrors of my life and the history I share with my Cronat.My journal, which I have kept with me all my life, will be delivered alongside this confession, and it shall divulge the truth: the greatest threat to face mankind in a thousand years.Alas, this must be our final goodbye.My thoughts and hopes remain with you, in life and death.Your ever loyal friend,      Edgar P.  Mokrikov      The General dropped the letter on the table.He looked at the chief and said, Where is it?Where is what?Edgars journal.Tell me you have it!He looked panicked.I ...I  You dont?He shook his head.Then where is it?Stolen, Vasily said.A criminal named Antal Justus took it from his office.I think he was retrieving it for someone else.From the way he spoke it seemed so.He took only the journal.I was unable to recover it or locate his whereabouts.He gulped.Does the letter speak of it?It only mentions it, but reveals that everything he wishes to tell me is in there.The letter itself divulges practically nothing.Does the name Malizar mean anything to you?Again Vasily shook his head.Did Mokrikov ever mention someone called the Cronat?No, General.Ruben exhaled in irritation.Meanwhile Vasily fell down into the seat opposite, wallowing in regret.I have failed you, General.And I have failed my lord.What hope is there now?Nothing stands in the way of the Dishan.Wed be best to sit right here and wait for the Crilshan armada to reach us.No doubt it will, sooner rather than later.Ruben watched the young man as he let out a low whimper of anguish.Something about his grief then woke the General from his turmoil; it was a reminder that he could not afford to despair.Gilaxiad and Erebuswhatever in the deepest bowels of hell they werewere undoubtedly tied together.Callista had made the connection.Mokrikov had provided what he could.He was the only one with the combined knowledge.And he was needed.His girls called for him, and he was going to get them back.No matter what the cost; no matter what needed to be done; they were now all that mattered.The chief looked up as Ruben stood and said, There is hope, my friend.There is something we can do.What can we do?Invade the hellhole Crilshar itself?Perhaps it will come to that, he said.But first we will call the Baren Igoth.The Baren Igoth?How?Even as an old man I have my ways.How far would you go, General?What would you do?Whatever it takes, he said, with eyes closed and a trembling jaw.Fifty Three      This is a bad idea!We shouldnt have come here.Bad idea.Terrible idea!Noah Nuveen mumbled and groaned as he moved quickly through a long corridorpristine white and completely silent in the darkness of night.He checked behind him, to both sides, and even above, more often than any normal person would.The aging runaway reassured himself that it didnt make him, as Raj Timbur so often put it, a slug in a lab coat.How he had allowed himself to be chosen for the principal role in such a perilous undertaking yet again hed never know.He was a doctor, not some bone headed galactic adventurer.Hed made his feelings very clear, and spent the majority of his time aboard the Flux the past year moaning about his level of involvement in their crackpot schemes and rescues.The last one hadnt exactly gone to plan.Hed warned his captain not to stay on Manera, and it had taken all of his strength not to say I told you so after the disastrous mission.Bad idea ...terrible idea.Will you be quiet!a female voice screeched through his ear comm.Hold it in and be a man!Noah swore under his breath and confirmed his wake was clear, before carefully turning a corner and glancing into the open doorway.He pulled back immediately.This is impossible!he whispered in a panic to his captain.The rooms full of patients and therere guards outside.Youre sure shes in this ward?This is a hospital, he heard back.Youre a doctor, and yes Im sure!Oh now Im chock full of confidence.Listen, just fake it.You know the plan.Yes I know it.Its making it work thats the problem!Well its the only one weve got.I know you can do it.Noah sighed.He looked at his reflection in a long mirror mounted on the wall behind him.He licked his hand and smoothed down a tiny tendril of tufting hair from the receding, dirty brown row.Baring perfectly straight teeth in a somewhat uncomfortable smile he adjusted his stolen name badge, puffed out his portly chest, and turned the corner.Donning a staid, humourless expression he nodded to the two guards standing at the rooms entrance, avoiding making eye contact, and shuffled past.Wait there, said one of the soldiers, however, a firm grip resting upon Noahs tense shoulder and dragging him backwards.Your pass?No ones to enter without one.Noah froze on the spot.My pass?Your pass.Generals orders.Of course.I ...err oh, yes ...my pass ...its  Doctor!called a voice from down the corridor.Doctor, there you are!He turned, relieved and shocked, to see a familiar looking woman quick march towards them.He almost choked when Adra Dimal stopped, lowered her hood, and brought her hand to her breast in salute to the guards.Credulous to her deception they returned the greeting, removing their hands from their holstered weapons.Noah coughed several times before straightening his back and bracing himself.Apologies for the misunderstanding, Dimal said, hiding behind a phony Titanese accent, but I bring confirmation from the Generals office.Callista Berenguer is to be moved tonight.Doctor Gigia is here to oversee her relocation.The General left the Cities on board the Quasar this afternoon, the closest soldier said.Yes ...well ...word has been received from his vessel.The old woman is to be taken for further tests.The two soldiers looked to each other.Right now?Yes, right away ...sir.The closest frowned and glared at Noah, who nodded in concurrence.What tests are those then, Doctor ...Gigia?Now shes done it, he thought, adjusting his stolen name badge.What do I say?Fortunately Dimal concealed his hesitation for him.More of the usual, she said, breaking the almost dangerous silence.You know how it is with these old ...chicatas!She grimaced at her own tease.The guards laughed.Dimal assumed an obviously forced cackle.She had quite clearly done this before.Noah attempted to laugh but found that, coupled with his almost noticeable quivering, all that came out was air.Dimal widened her eyes and nodded, and the duplicitous Doctor Gigia moved for the door.Hell be in and out as quick as antimatt, she said cheerily, taking a step herself.Noah knew something was wrong, however, when both guards placed their hands on the hilts of their electric weapons.The only problem is, grunted one, the old woman was moved two hours ago.Oh, furka!The guards tried for their weapons, but Adra Dimal already had hers in her grip.She snapped her arm up and, crashing the back of her blaster into the closest guards chin, sent a bolt of blue light at the armed hand of the other.The limb was taken clean off.Noah yelped and stuck out his foot.The first soldier backed over it and tumbled backward into the wall.Grinning proudly at the part hed played in the scuffle, he watched his captain take hold of the barely conscious one armed man and hold her weapon to his cranium.You say shes been moved?Dimal shouted.Where to?He struggled, but she held firmfire in her eyes.Where to?!You wont do it!he cried.Trust me, Noah warned him, she will.Where to?She prodded him with the blaster.Okay, okay!he said.Two floors up.Thirty second floor.But you wont get farthey already know youre here!She slammed the weapon into his skull and sent him out cold.Come on!she cried, and they took off running.Fifty Four      Aleksey Vasily waited for his signal.The viewing station of the Quasar emptied.A mistake could not be afforded, he reminded himself; the slightest error would make it all come crashing down.The Cronats orders were too important.So many lives were at stake.The last crewmember stepped out of the room, leaving Captain Mendoza, a solid, sturdy looking woman, to dead bolt the access gate.She stepped into position beside Vasily, out of sight, leaving only one stood at the main deck, alone and leaning with both hands on the engraved metal railing.Vasily took a deep breath, releasing it slowly.General Berenguer took his hands from the rail and placed them behind his back, closing his eyes as the lights dimmed.In the place where space was visible in all its grace suddenly appeared several screens; upon each was the image of a man or woman: representatives of the great worlds and leaders of the Systemal Alignment.Vasily had done his research; he recognised each of their glowering scowls, all of which were aimed identically towards the general before them.Ruben went to open his mouth, but was cut off.Who do you think you are threatening, you fool?cried one man.I agree!uttered a second, and then a third.What gives you the right to coerce us into cooperation?With blackmail of all ploys!Enough of your warmongering!Hear hear!Dog!The rabble took some minutes to die down.It was only then that Ruben spoke, calmly and decidedly unflustered.I take it you each received your summons?If by summons you mean the message threatening to release confidential Alignment documents, then yes, I did, answered a skinny, middle aged man.Vasily recognised the beard infested man as Representative Lord Di sak of Bravoralcapital world of the Third System, Accentauria.I regret that it had to come to that, my lord, Ruben said.Ill make sure you do regret it, Di sak grunted in return.The High Court beckons, General!I for one think it was despicably cunning, said another man, but nonetheless a genius, and without doubt necessary, move.Thank you, Von Viticus, the General said.Vasily surveyed the elderly gentleman, whose spectacles hung from the end of his generously proportioned nose.The Von, leaders of the many provinces of Earth, he recalled, had always been friendly to Titan.Well you would think that, Di sak addressed Von Viticus.Youre not in the Alignment!True, true.But the affiliation protects the interests of Earth as much as Bravoral or Mar Andra.Why else, in your all consuming wisdom, do you imagine I am here?Lord Di sak grunted.In all the meetings of the Baren Igothof which there had been fewnot a single one had been gathered like theirs.The meeting had traditionally been held upon a host world and all representatives would attend in person.But now they were onboard the Quasar, transmitting on vulnerable and easily exposed wavelengths.He recalled an old aphorism: all desperate times demand dangerous deeds.The General began by introducing the members of the Baren Igoth to Chief Vasily, who stepped forward and spoke of his ordeal and struggle with the armies of the Dishan upon Rotavar.He performed his part well enough; they were impressed by his courage but it seemed they still wavered at the thought of uniting against Crilshar.Lord Di sak continued to dispute any and all arguments Ruben put forth.The hopelessly out dated vision of a Humanity united has long since passed, he told the other members, whilst keeping his eyes fixed on the General.The Human Race has split through the core.He who stretches out his arms, desperately grasping for the others, will find too late he has no arms left with which to break his own fall.Ruben sighed.You believe we do not need each other?I did not say that.You may require assistance, but the moons of Bravoral are strong on their own.As is the Samosian Queendom, said Kind Lady Musarat, representative of the Queen of Samos.My mistake, Ruben said.I hadnt realised the days when the strong helped the weak were over.I was not aware I would be meeting with egocentric invertebrate.Another bout of jeers and catcalls broke out.Empires and superpowers emerge, shrivel, and supersede each other in the annals of history, Di sak said.The Systemal Alignment is over.Crilshar is now no more a threat than any other world, including yours.Bravoral and its moons have remained untouched.Are you suggesting I make war on a world which has done nothing to injure mine?Nothing yet, said Vasily.What was that?You heard the first time, my lord, Ruben answered.To make war on one of us it to make war on all.I disagree, said Musarat.It would appear to me, Di sak said, strong as my discernment is, that your goals are driven by your need for revenge.What are you saying?Your family was present upon Aurora, was it not?Yes, but that  Then you admit yourself that you are tainted with hatred for Crilshar at their loss?If indeed Crilshar is responsible.No, I  Who would not want retribution in your place?Vasily watched Rubens hand tighten into a fist behind his back.Are you even certain, asked Kind Lady Musarat, that the Dishan are responsible for the attack on Aurora?Who else would attempt such a horror?Exercise caution in your judgement, General, spoke Von Viticus.Yes, it is entirely likely the New Dishan Alliance is behind the attack, but what evidence do we have that this is true?None.Di sak laughed.Absolutely none at all!That is not true, Ruben said.Loss of communication with Outpost Aurora was noticed first by the moons of Ammisaduqa, which sent a retrieval vessel, but found no survivors.Upon discovering portions of a fragmented Titanese vessel they immediately sent me their reports.In short, the recovery team from Aurora found very few artefacts which can be used as evidence.But they have confirmed that the explosives used to destroy the outpost were of those developed and used by a faction within the New Dishan Alliance.Pavar XD 10s to be exact.Vasily watched the General step down to the middle of the viewing centre and take a small disk from his pocket, placing it onto the control panel and projecting an account detailing the attack on Aurora to each member of the Baren Igoth.Von Viticus frowned and sat back into his chair.Interesting, he said.But not condemning.Musarat agreed.The Pavars developed the technology, she accepted, and our intelligence would suggest many dealings with Crilshar, but the explosives in question have been sold in black markets for some years, have they not?This isnt evidence, Di sak grunted.You disappoint me, General.Vasily eyed Di sak warily.The Lord placed red shaded glasses on his thin, pompous nose, before peering upon Ruben with remarkable disdain.The Chief found something in his approach very familiar.What it was, he couldnt quite grasp.Ruben took a deep breath.We are not dealing with a substandard collection of underworld criminals here.This is the Dishan Alliance were talking about.A shortfall of evidence is an obstacle we will have to overcome.But to do that each and every one of us has to accept that Crilshar is a threat, whose aim is total control of the Alignment.What must we assume?Viticus asked.That the Dishan have a strategy, he said.And that that strategy involves something we have all heard of.What?said Di sak.Ruben placed both hands onto the balustrade, and lifted his head so that all of the gathering could see his face.Erebus, he said.The Weapon to Destroy Worlds.Fifty Five      Dimals uncontrollable blonde curls bounced and lashed at Noahs face as he raced behind her up the stairs to the thirty second floor of the infirmary.Youre sure this is what the crazy old man on Mars told you to do?he asked.Find an old woman, who, in all probability, will be just as crazy as him?!First off, the old man wasnt crazy, she said, leaping three steps in one.And what makes you think shell be?Ahem, its us!He said she can help find Justus.If theres even a chance thats true, Im taking it!How can she help?That ...he didnt say.This is a terrible idea, Adra, and you know it is.She reached for her comm and raised it to her jaw line.Raj, you there?Seconds passed, then:  Yup, Im here, Capn!Please tell me Aron Veryans safely in Titanese custody.Thats a yup, Capn!For sure?We can leave knowing shes safe?If it hadnt been for Aron Veryan the Flux wouldnt have even made it within Titans domes.Any official of the Titanese Guard, Noah knew, would be disinclined to refuse asylum to royalty and their escort.Thank heavens for Aron Veryan of Manera.Without a doubt, Raj replied.Shes gone.Not our problem anymore.Good, cos were moving to plan B.  As in be ready!Right o.  Good luck!She turned the link off and shot Noah a look he knew all too well.It was the same look Justus gave when things were falling apart around them; when he was inventing it all as he went along; a look somewhere between anxiety and excitement; a look he gave just before something bad happened.Here, Dimal said, tossing him the electric weapon shed stolen from wherever shed managed to acquire her uniform.What?I ...I dont know how to use this!Well nows the time to learn!They reached the thirty second floor, turned the corner, and, sure enough, found themselves faced with not two, but six coil bearing guards.A terrible idea!he shrieked.Shut up!She pulled him back round the corner.Hey, whos there?they heard.Ready?she said.No.She bowed round and fired wildly.The subsequent yelps told him that they now faced at least one guard less.Noah played with the coiled weapons controls as Dimal sent blast after blast, the wall nearby burning black with persistent replies.The deafening boom and crack of their weapons impaired his ability to hear Dimals screeched orders.Well this is good, Dimal said, dropping her weapon and breathing hair from in front of her face.My blasters overheated.This cant get any worse.Got it!Noah said, pushing down the silver key of the coil  A shooting pain surged the length of his arm.He bit his tongue in shock, slamming his head against the wall.NOAH!He shook his spinning head, knocked for six.Noah, you ass!Youve stunned yourself!Iwhat?Youve shocked your own arm!I told you!Terrible idea!Dimal took the coil from him and leaned around the corner.Dont come any closer!she told the guards.I cant feel my arm, he said in a panic, attempting to move the ten tonne limb and failing miserably.No surprise, she said.And now the coil wont work for me.Its assigned itself to your hand signature!Well I cant work it!Tough.Youre gonna have to!She took hold of his one good arm, placed the coil into his palm.The coil crackled into ignition and she pushed him around the corner.Shoot!He closed his eyes, and pressed the button.BAROOM!Dimal dragged him back as the corridor filled with smoke, joined by bits of rubble and the flailing arm of one of the guards.Oh, no, he said.I didnt mean to kill anyone!I know you didnt, Dimal said softly, snatching his face and kissing him on the forehead.Geroff!She grinned.Come on.Through the smoke and into the frenzied ward he found that his shot had missed the guards completely, instead striking the oxygen pipe leading into the ward and taking out the entire entrance to the unit, along with the rest of the soldiers.More would no doubt be coming.They rushed in and discovered the old woman lay unconscious in the middle of the row of beds.His ears were ringing from the explosion, but Noah could still make out the screaming from the other beds nearby.One elderly woman jumped up, screamed Intruder!and slapped him across the face.Ouch!He pulled the dividing screen across, muffling her squeals.Stop fooling about and come help me!Dimal was trying to wake one of them.Noah fumbled about with the old womans chart, resting the board on the edge of the bed, and using his only working arm to examine it.It says here that she woke up this evening for the first time in days, he said.Thats when they moved her.Anything interesting in there?she asked, untying the monitoring machinery.He flicked the page whilst checking his own arm, which still hung lifeless by his side.It also says shes allergic to ...err ...tmates.Whatre those?Dunno.Tomatoes, I guess.Really?Yes.Dimal seized a nearby lamp in frustration and launched it at him.Anything interesting and useful?Ouch!Noah massaged his shoulder; the very same shoulder from which hed removed a bullet not two days ago.He flicked the page again.It says here she survived an injection of Sizrthene.Wow, thats fatal in the smallest measures.Maybe the old man was right, she said.Maybe she is a Istron.Quick, help me wake her.Shes been sedated, he said.So she cant walk?Noah leant back with a hand on his hip.Not unless she sleepwalks!He looked about.A number of the women had risen from their beds and disappeared out through the smoking hallway.This was never part of the plan.How do we get her out then?Quick, grab that!she said, pointing to a wheelchair by the next bed.Well wheel her out!This gets better and better!Noah raced to the next bed, smiling awkwardly at the old woman who sat petrified beneath her sheets as he stole her chair.They unclipped Callista Berenguer from the remaining monitors and lifted her into it, before rushing back out.Rajs voice came through the loud speaker of Dimals comm as they ran:  Theyre all headed for you now.Theres no way youre getting outta that building, Capn.How else?Noah cried.Head up to the roof!Raj said.Theres no other way out for you.Ill force my way through and get you myself.No, dont!Oops, he said.Too late.Im on my way.Theyre right behind!Oh, great!Youd better have a plan once youre here then.Hurry!Dimal took off toward the lifts; there was no way they could get up the stairs wheeling the old woman.Noah ran behind pushing the chair with one hand, panting and calling for her to slow down.They made it into the lifts and, expecting to find it full of enraged guards, were able to go straight up unhindered.The abductors, however, were to suddenly find themselves faced with three problems simultaneously.Theyre storming the infirmary, guys, came Rajs voice through the link.Im almost there!Great, Noah thought, hearing those words and at that very moment realising the haggard old dear in front of him was beginning to stir.She raised her hand, clawing at his lab coat.Then Dimal turned.Her face was white and her jaw slumped.What?Theres no accessible roof on this building, she said, pointing to the control panel, and the platforms still damaged from the attack.What?She closed her eyes.Now were in trouble.Fifty Six      Ernesta Mendoza suffered every ounce of her generals frustration.She doubted there was anything he could say which would persuade the Baren Igoth of Crilshars guilt.They were too fearful of what they would have to do were the Dark Races guilt proven.She surveyed the line of Alignment representatives upon the great screen.Kind Lady Musarat was more interested in her riches and high status than she was the wellbeing of the people of Samos.Lord Di sak of Mar Andra was a coward, a chauvinist xenophobe.Shed heard what he did to those who opposed him: pretty much the same as those who didnt.Von Viticus wasnt much better.As delegate of the Von of Earth he was required to remain cordial at all times, not wishing to upset the existing state of affairs.Despite the fact that the Von had always been supportive of Titan and its aspirations, she doubted that was how Viticus really felt.If there was one among them that showed a glint of humanity, it was the Imperial representative of Enustinenone other than the Emperor himself.He had simply watched, silent, until now.But as the mind boggling concept of the old rumour of Erebus was brought up, Enusti Emperor Abacco finally spoke.You speak of an infiltrator, General.A Titanese mole within Crilshar itself.But you do not know who it is, nor whether they can be trusted.This is what you are telling us?I know it sounds absurd  Oh, we passed absurd a long while back, Di sak grunted.Now youre in the radius of a maniac.Belief or not, Abacco said, show some respect, my lord.Di sak grunted his response again.Even if we were able to prove Crilshars guilt, what could we do to stop them?Abacco asked.Their blockades are present in every System of man!The Enusti armies are strong and plenty, but even now we struggle to repel passing encounters with innumerable barrages.What would you consider the best course of action to take?Ruben took a deep breath.At this moment I would settle for nothing less than a single strike on Crilshar itself.Mendoza felt herself filling with hope; maybe the General could actually do it.The several representatives before him, however, cried out in abhorrence.Never!Not in a million decades!Titan may no longer consider Bravoral a friend!cried Di sak.Kind Lady Musarat did not answer, and her image disappeared from the viewing screen.Others followed suit.Few remained.Lord Di sak, Ruben said.You have intelligence on the weapon Erebus, have you not?Not this idiocy again!Erebus is a story.Erebus exists!he cried.Crilshar has found it, I assure you!Di sak slammed his fist into his monitor, cracking the glass in fury.It does not exist!And the very fact you believe it does proves just how far gone you are, General!His image vanished from the screen.Ruben brought his hand to his mouth.Mendoza stepped down to his side.The Baren Igoth was falling apart.Without proper support, Crilshar would go on with Titan powerless to counter assault.Silent moments passed.There may have been hope, said Emperor Abacco, were we having this meeting years ago.Back when the Alignment was strong, back when the Istrons lived among us.Would that those days had stayed but a little longer.They were brighter times, but they have fallen.And so will these.Ruben sighed.It doesnt have to be that way.Im afraid none of us have that choice, he replied.My thoughts are with you.And he was gone.Only one image remained before them.Only one would stand beside Titan.Von Viticus sighed deeply.You are certain that Crilshar is responsible for the attack at Aurora, and has attained the Weapon Erebus?Viticus asked calmly.Yes, Ruben said.Then the Von and Earth will aid you, General.We are the oldest of allies and I for one would rather assist you and fail than not act and still come to nothing.Ruben nodded weakly.Thank you.Be aware that to invade such a strong and well defended world we must have more support than we do now, said the Von.Yux Dishan is merciless; his sister Avaj eloquent and powerful; and they have Wivartha Dishan, one of the greatest tacticians to emerge in our time.The three will no doubt have anticipated battle.And Titan, Rotavar, and Earth combined cannot break through the many levels of Crilshar.The General nodded again.I will do all that I can to rally more assistance.We deploy in twenty four hours.Then our hope goes with you.The Von removed his glasses and bowed.Hope will ever remain so long as there stands one good man among the dark.Ruben Berenguer, you are that man.Fifty Seven      Complete and utter horror flashed across Noahs face as he glared at Dimal.Spasms prickled the length of his arm, its feeling returningthe only positive in their current circumstance.But that was about it.What do we do?he said.Dimal gazed back, unable to gather a sentence.I ...uh.What?What do we do?We ...I wish Justus was here.Hed have us out!The elevator shot towards the non existent infirmary roof.Noah bit his fingernails and watched Dimal, who suddenly noticed Callista Berenguer clawing weakly at his lab coat.Shes awake!Dimal cried.You think?Well, why didnt you say?Oh, he said, frantically, Im sorry if Ive got a few things to think about right now!Dimal ignored him and stooped down; she put her hand on their abductees arm and the woman gazed at her, half conscious.They stared for some moments, intensely searching.Then Dimal leaned forward and whispered carefully into her ear, before standing back up, still holding her hand and her gaze.Head ...to ...platform ...anyway.Huh?They both looked to the dark skinned woman in shock.What?Noah said.Did she just  Yes I did, you fool!said the old woman.Do as ...I say and head for the ...platform.Though hesitant, Dimal did as she was told and pushed the button, sending them back down to the fifty ninth floor.Noah gulped.Did the old woman realise she had just given them instructions which, if all went to plan, would result in her abduction?Or was it a trap, luring them into the open and out onto a platform that no longer existed?He edged beside his captain.Is she really a Istron?Thats what the old man on Mars said.Noah gulped again.Theyre ...heading up to ...the platform too, the old woman said, groggy but resilient.Dimal rested a hand on her shoulder.What do we do when we get there?She took Dimals hand and used her strength to help lift herself from the chair.Just ...wait.Ive ...seen it.Noah squirmed.Seen it?Seen what?The elevator door opened.The three poured out and rushed along the corridor.At the end of immaculate, shrubbery laden arches lay the rubble of the open terrace.The attack on Titan had taken out buildings and landmarks, as well as the extended platform of the central infirmary.It was a dead end.The Crimson Flux hadnt a chance in hell of landing.Just in time, from below their ship rose; the only way out.Raj waved from the cockpit and cried through the comm:  I cant land!Shree, go for the winch!The rear port of the ship opened slowly and Jayashri Timbur looked down at them from its opening.But the dreadful roar tearing through the air sent Noah sick to his stomach.In the distance he could make out several hovercraft thundering towards them.The Titanese Guard were coming, and something told Noah Nuveen they would receive no clemency.This is impossible!he yelled above the roar and the storm of the engine.We dont have time!Theres room for two on that hoist.One of us will have to stay behind!You two go!Dimal said.Its okay.Oh, do be quiet you fools!Callista shrieked.Do as I say and wait!Stop whimpering, Noah.And take out your blaster, Adra.The Flux hovered close, its rear port facing the building head on with nothing less than a fatal plunge dividing.The craft rose steadily higher, passing above them.A cable and harness dropped down.But not close enough.Noah leaned out, Titans streets visible far below.But he could not grasp the cable.Its no use!Take my hand, the old woman told him, and she clutched Noahs arm in a talon like grip.And then, before he knew it, she had pushed him over the edge.The shock of it almost killed him there and then, but in the sudden grip of fear he stretched out both arms and found the cable.The stunned limb lost its grip, but the other found the harness and by god it was not about to let go.Shree hauled him up as quickly as she could, and once inside Noah grasped her as tight as he could, having never been so happy to be on board the Flux.She grinned and picked him up.Massaging his hip and the wound in his shoulder, he stood and gasped as a missile penetrated the rear port.Wait, no.Not a missile.Noah and Shree watched as Dimal and Callista, now airborne, soared through the dark space of night and landed on top of them in a groaning heap.At once Dimal was on her feet and, raising her blaster, retracted the cord back inside it.Forget Justus, he said.Youre brilliant!Shree slammed the ramp closed and they all ran through the interior of the craft and into the cockpit, where Raj twisted and turned the Fluxs controls to avoid the Titanese hovercraft, now right behind.A salvo of bullets or shrapnel or whatever they used to bring down their enemies brushed past the craft and Noah, Shree, and Callista took refuge in the corner.Move over!Dimal shouted to Raj and she forced him from the pilots seat.She pushed them into a vertical drop, driving the Flux down past the infirmary and through the narrow city streets.The Guard followed hesitantly, careful not to affect more damage to their home than had already been caused.They left the streets, still ensnared in the central city like a great eagle in an aviary.How do we get out?Noah said, clutching the wall and wishing somebody would for once tell him the whole plan.We cant go back the way we came, Dimal said, avoiding a vicious assault and yelping as she chipped the top off another tall structure.Well never get back to the dock!I have an idea, Raj said.Well I suppose thats reason to be hopeful!Noah snivelled.Quiet, slug!Letting go of the secondary controls Raj turned to the screen beside him.Whatre those?Dimal asked.Central city plans.He looked to Dimal.Head up.She obeyed.They fled higher and higher.Noah swallowed painfully, his sinuses straining with three deep pops.This is recklessabsurd!But Dimal kept her cool, having left the enemy craft in her wake.Darling, she said through gritted teeth, where am I heading?Wait for it, Raj said.Waaait for it.Oh, come on!There!he said, pointing to the uppermost bend in the dome.An auxiliary tunnel.Head for it!The Flux shot upward, gaining speed, and as they reached the auxiliary escape tunnel Raj accessed the gate through the Fluxs CPU and the tunnel opened.Dimal forced the ship through.Another tunnel lay beyond, and eventually the last thing preventing their freedom.Thisll be reinforced, Raj said.Get firing then!The craft shook and vaulted through the breach.Noah collapsed to the ground as they pummelled through, unscathed, disappearing into the thick, red haze of Titans atmosphere.Shree lifted him up and held him tight as Dimal laughed and Raj hooted at their impossible getaway.Noah found himself so relieved he actually joined in, jumped up and down, wolf whistling and cheering.It was only when he looked down and Raj pointed to his crotch in a tactless fit of laughter he realised that, in all the excitement, he had in fact wet himself.Perfect.Once he had dried himself off and changed into a tight old pair of Justus pants, he sauntered up to the cockpit, passing the Istron, Raj, and Shree as they sat apart, silent, and approached Dimal, who navigated them through the complexities of the Saturnian System.The asteroid belt reached out beneath them: shards and chunks of ice and rock numbering billions.Well be ready to make the leap shortly, she told him as he approached.Wonderful, he replied.Now tell me something.We did as the old man told us.Now what?Dimal flicked a number of switches and leaned back.Now we save Justus.And just how do we do that?he said, almost at breaking point.I know, I know.We follow the old mans coordinates across the Systems in this piece of junk, avoiding Crilshan armadas and the innumerable amount of other vessels no doubt after us now, with the giant and brains and an old crackpot who just threw me from that towers fifty ninth floor, all in the hope that we can trust some stranger only you have ever seen, who wont even tell us who he is?!Dimal nodded without turning.Yes.He breathed in deep.Okay then.You done?Pretty much.I do have one more issue.What?We just abducted that old woman.Yeah ...and?Well dont you think it strange she just agreed to come along, and even helped us kidnap her?She turned and looked straight at him.The old man on Mars told me to tell Callista something.He told me shed help no matter what I asked.The old man told you to tell her what?Dimal leaned closer.Im not sure what it means, but whatever it is, it worked.What did you whisper to her in the elevator, Adra?The weary womans eyes met with Noahs.I told her that her master sends his call.Fifty Eight      Springing awake, Anna felt a hand touch hers.It was cold.A mask or heavy helmet was lifted from her face, forcing her eyelids to fasten shut as they collided with the light.Slowly opening them again she looked into the intense, piteous eyes of the man from her nightmares.He looked back at her and removed the ear caps.Here, he said, removing the wrap from over her mouth and holding out a small cup of water.You must be thirsty.He was right.She was so thirsty she could hardly open her mouth, but she refused the water and whimpered, Who ...Who are you?Where are we?He did not answer.Drink, he told her.She refused again, too weak to move her head as she leaned back, just enough to discern her whereabouts: a long room, some sort of cargo bay or holding cell.The distorted walls were lined with people just like her, sitting in rows, bound and masked in heavy metal.None were moving or even making a sound; blind, deaf, and mute.Drink, he said a third time, and again Anna refused.Whats your name?Anna.Beautiful name, Anna, he said with a slight, gentle smile, very different from the angry, violent man she had seen upon Aurora.Im Antal.My ...My sister, she said.Where is she?Is ...Is she all right?The young girl?Blonde?Anna nodded.Over there.Shes okay.And he put down the cup, raised the mask, and placed it back over Annas sweating face.A nauseating reek filled her lungs and at once her head spun; she swooned and fell back into a forced sleep.Back in her nightmare, she was surrounded by darkness, the black, overwhelming orb, and the same man.GILAXIAD!she heard, deep and booming.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!And before she knew it, she was awake once more.All was dark.A constant drone on all sides only encouraged the feeling of both hunger and nausea.How long she had been out was impossible to tell; she knew only that she was being taken somewhere.Could it be the Dishan?Was she on her way to Crilshar that very moment?Searching her mind she attempted to recall past events.Her brain felt like a brittle, dry sponge, memories seeping through, but she could remember the long journey from Titan, the chaos on Rotavar, the loss of Jon.How could she have forgotten him?She recalled the voyage onboard the Stellarstream, her guilt for allowing Glana to join her, and the desperate longing to see uncle Ruben once more.Then it all returned: the destruction on the old outpost; the fire and the death and the man from her nightmares.The pale man.GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!GILAXIAD!For the second time Anna felt the cold touch of skin on her bound hands, and again her mask was removed.Hello, Anna.Anna did not reply.She did, however, accept the drink of water from Antal that time.Looking down at her arm it appeared she was being fed something through a tube.But she still felt weak, and did not speak to Antal Justus; and for the second time he left her, placing the mask back on.* * *  Antal Justus crept into the eerily quiet cockpit of the Fated Chaos, the lighting low as two pilots basked in the pensive silence.The steady hum of the ships ultimatt engine soothed him.This is where he was meant to be: onboard a ship.His ship.How he missed the Flux, his crew, the danger; but most of all that sense of freedom he found whenever he lifted his beauty up and into the endless starry skies.Hed not stopped thinking of Anna since theyd set off.There was something about her, something he couldnt place a finger on.Breathing deeply, he lingered a short time, bringing a hand to his chin and stroking the small amount of dark stubble that had built up in the past two weeks.The assignment Lesper had given him hadnt gone exactly to plan.He hadnt anticipated for a second that they would encounter as much resistance as they did.The setback meant his craft had only just made it away from Aurora, but not before receiving some damage of its own; and so he had made the decision to head for Enustine controlled Chiro, a small, unterraformed world.Theyd kept their captives alive and hidden there for five days.But five days at a complete standstill was five days too many.So many thoughts and worries filled his sorely strung out mind.Gravest of all, and constantly at the forefront of his cares, was the distressing message theyd received whilst on Chiro.Theyd left as soon as the message had arrived, repairs unfinished.The pilots realised that Justus had been stood behind them and so jumped up, dragging their feet from the dash, and at once they began checking dials and various protocols, pressing buttons superfluously.Relax, fellas, Justus said, and the two slowed with relief.Any more word from Erebus station?No, Captain.Nothing.Communication?None, sir.Justus sighed.Play the message again.Yes, sir.Most of the transmission was missing, which was to be expected given Erebus proximity to the communication outposts, but the panicked voice of Araman Alwar broke through the incoming garble of hisses, clicks, and a whole load of static.Captain Just ...disaster has ...they escaped ...our help ...ast as you ...pass ...we hope you ...it looks ...dead.The unnerving tone of the signal made Justus heartbeat accelerate; as though an alarm were racing through his entire body and no one else could hear it.Two words stuck with him:  They escaped.A shiver flew down his spine.None of those now with him knew what he knew about the creatures Lesper and Kramer had been experimenting with.If one of those things had gotten loose then he didnt much fancy returning with a ship anything less than one hundred percent.Without another option and despite his qualms, he maintained the Chaos course for return to Erebus and mentioned to no one what was, or may no longer be, contained in Section Six.* * *  Anna looked deep into Antal Justus eyes.Your sister is doing well, he told her on his fourth visit since Aurora.Her condition is steady.Shes coping fine.Can I see her?she asked.His eyebrows rose a little, his strong jaw slumped somewhat; as though he understood, as though he wanted nothing more than to say yes.Im afraid I cant allow it.Anna swallowed.Her eyes welled with tears.The third time he had come to see the young girl, they spoke a little, though she noticed he was very good at avoiding parting with any real information.Justus was an unusual man.How could somebody do what he had done so cruelly and yet appear to care for her?Time passed and very soon she felt no fear of him at all.After almost an hour in silence he said, unexpectedly, I feel as though I know you, Anna.Wh ...What do you mean?He edged closer and breathed deeply.Do you believe in premonitions, Anna?You mean like visions?Dreams?Yeah.Well, actually  Its a stupid question, he said.Forget it.And he knelt nearby for some time with a sad, silent struggle in his eyes.His teeth gritted; his expression foreboding.Are we going to Crilshar?Anna dared to ask.He looked up, concerned.Crilshar?Why would you think that?Do I look Crilshan to you?No you dont.I just ...I  Whats your full name?Anna what?Driad, she said, instinctively, remembering her uncles words: if ever they were captured or found themselves in danger, they were not to use their true names.Anna Driad was her assumed title.These people were not Crilshan, and she had no idea who they could be.Driad, Justus repeated.From Titan?No, she said, without thinking.We stowed away ...me and my sister ...when the soldiers from Titan landed on Rotavar.The Crilshans attacked us.I know.Justus stood, frowning.I was there.You said youre not working for Crilshar!Im not.Or, at least I dont think I am.That was it for their fourth encounter.Antal Justus said nothing more; and he simply placed the mask carefully back over her face, imposing upon her the world of nightmares once more.The eternal dwelling of darkness, terror, and Gilaxiad.Fifty Nine      General Ruben Berenguer looked out at the gusting image of space blazing around him.Here we are, he thought.Word had reached him.They had arrived within Proxima.This is where it begins.The scarlet sun of Proxima loomed.The closest planet to the Systems star was Crilshar itself.Save for the capital world, very few bodies orbited Proxima.Some were inhabited.Others were not.One of those inhabited bodies was known as Gobisla.And Gobisla is where the Quasar now arrived.The ultimatt engines had been cut two hours earlier, allowing time for the reverse engines to begin deceleration.For all intents and purposes, Ruben was steady, clear headed, and retained his resilient authority.But in actual fact he was dying.Every long, agonizing moment he spent leaping through space was a moment wasted.Anna and Glana were out there, and he would tear Crilshar to ruins to find them.General?A hand gripped his shoulder.General?He snapped himself out of his contemplation.Chief Aleksey Vasily stood beside him, motioned to the image on the viewing centre screen: a foreign planetary system.Directly ahead rose Gobisla.I saw what you were reading in the analysis room, Vasily said.I know where youre taking us.You do?Were going to see the Retanis, arent we?Ruben blinked.We are.Are you mad?Evidently.Vasily frowned.I dont know much about the Retanis, he said, and call me misinformed, but I was under the impression that relations between the Retani Dynasty and Titan were less than cordial.You are not misinformed, Chief, he said, sighing and folding his arms.Contact between our worlds was cut before the last conflict with Crilshar and the Alignment, over fifty years past.You may be aware the Retani Dynasty possesses a consortium of three moons in the centre of this System.Proxima.Yes, two of which are used solely as prison moons.Hellfire and Tartarus?Ruben bowed his head.Theyre powerful, very powerful.But they keep to themselves when it comes to Systemal politics.I read that the Crilshans leave them alone, which is why they arent in the Dishan Alliance and why there was never a Retani representative at the Baren Igoth.Again true.The Dishan have long tried to buy the support of the Retanis.But theyve kept themselves out of important matters.For too long if you ask me.If what we believe is true and this weapon the Crilshans are cultivating can take Titan out of the equation so easily, then I see no reason why they wont then turn it on every other power that can threaten them.I think the time has come to reopen negotiations with Gobisla.Vasily lingered at Rubens side, staring at the large, barren planet ahead.I did some reading of my own, he said.They run their prison moons as a business, turning over more profit than any world out there.The galaxy will never run out of criminals.But we do have one slight issue.That being?They will likely only help us if they believe it to be in their interest.Then how do we persuade them helping us is in their interest?Simple, Ruben said with a nervous grin.
