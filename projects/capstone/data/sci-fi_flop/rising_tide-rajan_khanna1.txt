The lights come and wake me from dying.At least I must be dying because Im wet and cold and bleeding and everything seems broken inside of me.All around me I can smell smoke and burning gas and the sea.Inside of me, a voice insists that theres something next to me.Something good.Something to save me.But when I try to turn, everything goes black again.Death hovers, close by.The lights bring me back, dancing over me with a roaring hum.I remember stories I read when I was a kid, stories of angelsbright, blinding, flying angels.Have they finally come for me?Some moments pass, my head spinning, and then theyre lifting me up, out of the raft, and into the sky.Where are you taking me?I want to ask.But I cant.And something about leaving the ocean, going up into the sky, feels right.More time passeshands touching me that I cant shrug off.I slip away once or twice.When I awake again, I hear someone saying to take me to the infirmary.Its apt because Im very fucking infirm.Anyone would be after the last few days Ive had.Beaten, shot, strung out on painkillers, beaten again, stabbed, then dropped from an exploding airship into cold ocean waters.Well, when I say dropped, I mean more like I jumped.But it seemed like a good idea at the time.Thinking about that makes me think of the Cherub, my airship, which was named after angels, and the last time I saw her, ripping apart into a bright fireball as I fell.It brings on pain of a different flavor.She was more than just my homeshe was my safety, my security, my freedom.Miranda, I manage to gasp.Shes the other woman in my life.Or rather, the one whos left.She fell with me, into the ocean.We somehow both managed to survive, huddled in the bottom of a life raft, clinging to one another, wet and cold, our ears still ringing from the explosion, flames still dotting the water where the fiery wreckage fell.We lay there, together, and I couldnt even think.All I did was hold Miranda and take comfort in the fact that we were alive and together and she was solid in my arms.Later, I thought that if we managed to make it through the night into the morning, that we might have a shot.She was what was next to me, I remember.Shes what I was trying to find.Miranda, I repeat.Who?a voice asks.Thats her name, another voice replies.The woman.Where is she?I ask.Is she okay?Shell be back soon, one of the voices says.I reach up for the arms nearest me, grip them as hard as I can.No, I say.I need to know.Then my grip wavers and my arms go watery and the person pulls away from my grasp.Give him another one, a voice says.Then I feel a sharp pinch.And the world draws away around me.Im below the ocean, only this time its warm and thick, not the shocking, freezing thing it was after I fell.Its comfortable.Almost welcoming.I find this amusing since I have always preferred the sky.But slowly I feel myself start to rise and the air gets thinner and brighter, and then Im opening my eyes to ...light.I smell metal and the sea and antiseptic.As my vision clears, I realize Im lying on a tablecold metal, but with some kind of tarp draped over it.Im not wearing a shirt, and my wounds have been bandaged.I ache, but the pain is dulled, lost in the wake of the painkillers Ive apparently been given.A woman wearing a surgical mask sees me stir, then leaves the room.As I sit up, feeling the skin pulling on my wounds, and grunting because of it, the door opens again and a man enters what I now realize is the infirmary.The metal tables and the counters and instruments all paint the picture.But my attention is drawn to the man.Malik.Hes looking better than he was the last time I saw him.His skin is tanned by the sun to a light brown color.Hes wearing his black hair long and he has an extremely neatly trimmed beard, which is a nice trick, seeing as how most of the tools for that kind of thing have long since turned to shit.He stands at the edge of my table and eyes me up and down.Mal, I say, suddenly on edge.Youre alive.Benjamin, he says, like he just picked a bullet out of his teeth.As sharp as ever.My God, I say.I had no idea.I feel something hard lodge in my chest.Thank you for patching me up.He shakes his head.Like everything he does, its a precise movement, no wasted energy.That wasnt me.That was courtesy of your companion.Miranda?He nods.How is she?Where is she?I need to see her.I start to get up off the table, but he pushes me back, firmly and precisely, and my chest erupts into a constellation of pain despite the drugs Im on.You dont get to make demands, he says, and I see his carefully cultivated mask slip for a moment.Whats behind is rage.And I know exactly why.Mal and I go way back, and our last meeting didnt end so well.He straightens and examines his gloves.Miranda is safe and unharmed, Benjamin.That will have to suffice for now.My mind races, then falls back into an old, familiar pattern of movement.Even through the painkillers its a place Im used toassess, look for opportunities, survive.Its clear that Mal isnt happy with me, and Im not sure I blame him.But he still pulled me out of the ocean.Still let Miranda patch me up.So Im on unsteady ground.I dont know what he wants.And so I cant use that.What happened to you?He knows what Im asking.How did he survive?What happened after I saw him last?He looks away for a moment.Pardon me if I dont feel like digging up ancient history, he says.I have no wish to reminisce about old times.I get that youre mad at me Mal slams his fist down on the edge of the table and I jump, again feeling the pain ripple through me.Mad?Mad?He shakes his head, his face twisted with disgust.You continue to underestimate me, Benjamin.I take a deep breath.So why am I here?You didnt need to fish me out of the water.Mal takes a deep breath, too, smoothing his long hair back from his face where it had fallen.He straightens his jacket.His face returns to its impassive state.My people saw the wreckage in the water.Fresh wreckage.He shrugs.Old habits.They were checking for salvage ...and information.What kind of information?What do you think, Benjamin?Youre telling me that if you saw that kind of fallout, it wouldnt attract your attention?Were operating in these waters.Knowing whats happening around us is only prudent.I try to process all of this, and its hard with the painkillers dragging on my thoughts.Cmon, Ben.Get it together.I return to the phrase were operating in these waters.Could Mal be working with Gastown?I look back up at him to see him examining my face.Are you working with Gastown?I ask.It isnt subtle, and its not what I had planned to say (as far as I planned anything) but it just spills out.He squints, then shakes his head.No.Neither in its former nor current incarnations.Thats how Mal likes to speak.Never a simple word when a more ornate one will do.In that way hes a little like Miranda.I nod.Those were Gastown ships in the water.Them and the Cherub.I feel a pain when I mention my airship.Ive heard tell of people having phantom pains in lost limbs.Could you have that for an airship?I know this already, Mal says.Your companion told me.I frown.You still havent told me why Im here, then.If Miranda told you what happened, you could have dropped me back in the ocean.I thought of it, he says with a smile.Believe me, I thought of it.But?I wanted you to see me.I wanted you to know that I survived.He waves a hand in the air, nonchalantly.I have no illusions that it will provoke a response, but I needed you to know.I nod.Its classic Mal.His ego has always been one of his most developed attributes.So now that I know, now you toss me in the ocean?His face goes serious.No.No?No.Your companion and I Miranda....Miranda and I came to an agreement.My head is still swimming, and none of this is making sense.Mal is alive.And wants to kill me.Yet Im still alive.And he made a deal with Miranda?We always have need for people with medical training, he says.He shrugs.She made her skills known to me.But...He pauses for a moment.Shes quite shrewd.She insisted that she demonstrate her skills.On you.Its such a nice piece of negotiation that I cant help smiling.Its the kind of thing I usually try to doidentify a need, make myself useful, benefit.She not only secured a safe space for herself, but she saved me in the process.All I can say is that youre very lucky, Mal says.None of my people would have worked on you.Not in your state.Not without quarantine.And you probably would have died, otherwise.I locked her in here with you, with some medical supplies, and she worked on you through the quarantine period.That youre alive, and awake, is a testament to her abilities.Shes one of the best.He nods.That, we can agree on.How she chose to associate with you...People change, Mal.The look he gives me sends chills through me.Its like being in a room with a wild animala wolf or a cougar.Mal clearly hates me.He has lots of reason to, Ill admit, but he also has all the power here.I keep trying to kick my brain out of the painkiller fuzz, but its slow going, all uphill, and gravitys pulling at me.Miranda had been thinking quickly, making herself useful, saving me.Now I have to do my part.Mal, I He quiets me by holding up his hand.Please dont, Benjamin.I can see the achingly slow grinding of your minds gears.Youre going to try to give me reasons not to kill you.Damn.The thing is, Benjamin, I had a plan; one I thought poetic.I would leave you in the ocean, all alone, with no wings to carry you.With no friends to aid you.Leave you in the great vastness and just ...sail away.I could take odds on what would get you firsta shark?some other ship?drowning?The thought scares me more than I ever imagined it could.But Im not.Why?Mal rubs at a spot on his left glove.That was the other part of my agreement with Miranda.Her terms were that she get to demonstrate her skills on you, and ...that I keep you alive until we reach our destination.Thank God, I think.He must see the relief on my face because he says, What I promised her, exactly, was that I would keep you on the ship.And that I wouldnt take any action to harm you.And so I wont.Because it doesnt matter.He smiles at me.Once we arrive, however, I will have my moment.Believe me when I say that Ive been imagining all the many things I might do with you at that point.Another scary feeling, this time one that sticks like a rock in my gut.Just then, my mind clears a bit more and I realize what he just said and that the rocking sensation Im feeling isnt completely from the drugs.Did you say ship?Its not an airshipI would know if it was.Are we on the water?Your speed is as remarkable as always, Mal says.Cut me a little slack, I say.Ive had a lot of painkillers.I am aware, he says, glaring at me.He sighs.Yes, you are on board a ship right now.A warship.Shes called the Phoenix.You stole her?He looks at me, sharp, assessing.Like a bird.I recovered her.Of course you did, I think.She was secured in a naval facility.My people and I liberated her.Its a score, of course.Military targets have long been a flame the foraging moths have flown to over the years, but as a result the pickings are slim.Even if you do find something intact worth taking, the effort of getting it operational, being able to run it, is often too much.There are plenty of rotting old hulks in naval yards and off the coast.That he found one and managed to get it to work....It took years to get it running, he says.Time during which my people were vulnerable.He smiles.But in the end we were triumphant.Jesus, I think.A warship.In Mals hands.The weapons?I ask.His smile grows wider.Almost completely operational.That was one of the most difficult parts.She was partly stocked, but making sure everything worked and was loaded properly took some time.I dont believe it, I say.His smile is predatory and triumphant.That is because you have no imagination.We achieved a great victory, here, my people and I.  And it will be our salvation.The word makes me uneasy.Especially in the Sick.So you live here.He nods.In some ways, the ocean is safer than the sky.I find the words distasteful, but they make me think of Tamoanchan, an island settlement I recently visited.I think of Diego and Rosie, Sergei, even Clay.All the people Miranda and I left behind.I thought that sacrificing the Cherub might have saved them from attack, but that didnt mean more wouldnt be coming.I needed off this ship.Where are you sailing it?I ask.Hawaii.A legend of sorts.Ive met people who determined to go there, lured by the promise of old magazines and books.You know its overrun with Ferals, right?He shrugs.Thats the rumor.But its a series of islands.And by now the Ferals should have dwindled, equalized to a stable number.We can take our time to clean them out.And if the idea of it keeps others away, then all the better.If their maps already say, Here there be monsters, then why disabuse them of that notion?I shake my head.Thats the life youre going to lead?Doesnt seem suited to someone like you.Things change, is all he says.I chew on it for a bit.Mal was on his way to a leadership position the first time I met him, but he seems to have taken it quite seriously.Seriously enough to risk his life on a dream.Miranda bought me some time.But then what?Even if he doesnt kill me right away, well be stuck there.With no way of getting off.Things do change, I say.Let me prove it to you.Mal laughs.You?I cant help frowning at him.Oh, Benjamin.I see what you mean.Youve developed a sense of humor.Mal No.The word is as hard and cold as stone.I dont care if youve changed.If you can grow wings or if you shit out my hearts desire on command.I have you.And Im taking you with us until I can deal with you in the appropriate way.He leans forward.Do you get that?You are mine.He turns to leave.Meditate on that on our journey.Then he leaves me to my solitude.They move me to something more resembling a cell shortly later, something that was probably a bunk back in the Clean.Theres a simple bed, a sink, and a toilet.I suppose it could be worse.I could have to shit on the floor.They feed me, too.Scraps and slop, but its something.I guess Mals sticking to his promise to Miranda.I can imagine him rationalizing it, too.Telling himself hell punish me at a time and place of his choosing.He has an overdeveloped sense of honor.Something tells me that Miranda picked up on that and used it against him.Thinking of Miranda sends a pang through menot knowing where she is, or how she is.What shes doing.How Mals treating her.Theres no way that hes going to let her see me.That will be off limits, even if she wants to, but....But theres this strange, nagging voice inside my head that says maybe she doesnt want to see me.I dont think it makes sense, but it still pipes up from time to time.I keep trying to stamp it down.And this is the problem with being stuck with no one but yourself.With no books or music or people to talk to.You start having crazy thoughts.In one of these, Mal charms Miranda and, well, lets just say she responds.Im definitely going to go crazy in here.Of course I search my cell for means of escape but, well, there doesnt seem to be any.The door to the room is locked from the outside, and there are no windows or other openings inside.There is the toilet, but judging by its dimensions, the hole beneath it would be too small for me to squeeze through.Just one book, I think.One book.It wouldnt even matter which one.Once, when I was holed up in an old house that just happened to sit next to a Feral nest, I read the same book four times.In a row.And it was about rabbits.Another time, when Dad had dropped me off on a rooftop, circling around to pick me up later (and got delayed), I read the same romance novel twice, the second time acting out all the parts.I sometimes go to great lengths to pass the time.A short time later, my food arrives.Those scraps and slop.Its skins and rinds and cores, cartilage and bone.The vegetables are just shy of rotting, the fish is too soft and has a smell that almost makes me gag.Something that was once leafy and green is now a muddy smear.Yet I open my mouth and shovel as much as I can in.Because I need to eat, and Im hungry.I need to heal.That I dont enjoy it doesnt really come into it.Much.It helps that Ive been on my own and hungry for much of my adult life.Ive eaten all kinds of things out of desperation.This is tolerable at its worst.Or at least thats what I tell myself.Especially every time I start to gag.I start marking the days on my mattress, scoring lines into the fabric covering.One.Two.Three.I start talking to myself.Except that quickly that loses all appeal.Im a terrible conversationalist.So I start thinking about the old days.About the last time I saw Mal.It wasnt a good time.TWO It happened back a short while after my father Faded, when I was still flying around with Claudia.This was back before she got the Valkyrie, when the two of us were living on the Cherub.I had been telling Claudia that we could get by with foraging, but she wanted to do other things, take on jobs, try for the big score.I eventually agreed.I think we were both reeling from what happened to Dad and were trying to strike out into new territory.And, I cant speak for her, but I was definitely feeling a little self destructive at the time.So we spent more time around people.There was no Gastown back then, but there were other settlements, either fixed or roaming.Its hard to keep track of people in the Sick, but there are ways.When you move on, leave a message behind about where youre headed, and a radio frequency.If someone is looking, all they have to do is go to that location and scan for signals.Of course you have to do it in code so not just anyone can find you.So we kicked around zep dives until we found what we were looking for.The ultimate score.A police storage facility, Cheyenne said.She wore a cowboy hat and always seemed peppy.The smile on her sun freckled face was as wide as the sky.We sat on a rooftop in San Francisco, our airships anchored around us, five folding chairs arranged in a rough circle.Forget it, I said.Everyone looked at me.Too much trouble.Ive hit police installations before.Getting past security is tricky enough, and its almost certainly crawling with Ferals.Not to mention that its probably been looted before.Or maybe someones living there.A lot of police facilities had shelters in them.That made them attractive to anyone looking to hole up.Not to mention the weapons and ammunition they usually held.Dont worry about security, Cheyenne said and winked at me.She actually winked.I looked at Claudia, who shrugged.We knew Cheyenne the least out of everyone involved with this job.But of course shes the one who came with the details.No, seriously, Cheyenne continued.Thats what Malik is for.All eyes turned toward Malik standing quietly behind his chair.His hair was shorter then, and he favored a mustache over a full beard, but he otherwise looked much the same.He seemed preternaturally calm, unruffled.Out of everyone involved in the job, I had known Mal the longest, excluding Claudia.We were about the same age, ran in similar circles.Mal was a forager, too, though he often trod the fine line between foraging and pirating.Oddly enough, he had a good reputationhe didnt kill or attack the vulnerable.And he seemed more interested in forming a group, getting like minded people to work together.He had asked me to join several times, but I couldnt really see myself doing that.We had worked on opposite sides in the past, but also together.I shouldnt have liked him, but the thing is, I really did.We had a kind of friendly rivalry.Benjamin is quite familiar with my ability to crack locks, he said.He directed a smug smile at me.Surely you remember Portland.Or Reno.Both places where hed scooped me.To the others he said, his smile never wavering, I am quite practiced in cracking old locks.Often the cargo I liberate is locked or secured, and its worth far more in pristine condition.And Ive been in military installations before.Already that had become part of Mals reputation.It kept him and his entourage well armed and well stocked.It also meant he was a good addition to this job.Do we know this place hasnt been hit before?I asked.Thats just it, Cheyenne said.Its not on a base or a station.Its not an obvious target.Where, then?Claudia asked.Cheyenne tipped her cowboy hat back from her head.A warehouse.A big storage facility.She leaned in.Its military grade equipment.Sold to the police.The way I hear it, the police were like small armies back in the Clean.They had too much to keep in their station.Theres plenty of stories about that kind of thing, Tess said, leaning back in her chair.A lot of that kind of equipment saw use when the Bug hit.Tess had been making a name for herself, at the time already an expert in the Clean.She was older than all of us, short and square and smart.She looked at us from behind large, thick glasses.Its quality equipment, Cheyenne said.But the scuttle is that they never got a chance to use it.Because of where it was.And how exactly did you find out about this cache?I asked.I looked at Tess, who shook her head, indicating it wasnt her.Whats it matter how I found it?Cheyenne asked.Because if some cracked out drunk told you about it, I want to know, I said.If some plod sold it for a ride in your ship, I want to know.It matters.Cheyenne held up her hands.Okay, okay.I did a favor for a guy I know, a fixer, and he was gonna patch up my ship.Only the favor was a fuck lot more dangerous than either of us expected.The ship didnt need no more work, and so he offered something else.This location.Howd he get it?Claudia asked.His father, read?Hed been trying to get people together to go after it, but he doesnt fly in the right circles.So he gave it to me.Just like that, I said.Well, he wants me to bring him back something.A taste of sweet barter.But thats it.And you swallow this?I asked Tess.She nodded.I did some preliminary checking, and it seems to be legit.As far as these things go.It wouldnt exactly have been common knowledge back then.Everyone was silent as we mulled the whole thing over.So whats the plan?Claudia asked at last.Cheyenne smiled.We use only one ship.That way we dont attract too much attention.Ben, yours should do.Shes fast, Claudia says, and you have the cargo space we need to get anything we want off of the ground.Okay, I said.Malik and Lord Tess help get us in, dealing with any physical or electronic security.The rest of us are musclewe clear out any Ferals in the way.Then all of us grab what we can carry, bring it back to the ship, and get the fuck out of there.Even split?I asked.Cheyenne nodded.Fairest way possible.I looked at Claudia.It sounded fine, especially with five of us, but what it ultimately came down to was a matter of trust.I trusted Claudia, of course.And probably Mal.Or maybe not trust, but respect.I knew that I could depend on him and his abilities.Id heard of Lord Tessshe had a reputation even back thenand she seemed on the straight, but I didnt know Cheyenne from a patch of cloud.What do you think?I asked Claudia.She narrowed her eyes.I think that if this bears out, it could keep us flush for some time.And I think that with this kind of score, I might just be able to get my own ship.I gritted my teeth at that.She had been talking about getting her own ship for weeks now.I wanted her to stay on the Cherub with me.Sure, we sometimes came close to killing one another, and I often found myself wanting to be by myself.But back then I never had been.I had always been with my father.I think the thought of being truly alone scared me to death.What do you say?Cheyenne asked.With a sinking sensation in my stomach, I stared her in the eyes and said, Were in.When youre an independent airship operator, your ship is your home.Its often your livelihood.Its usually one of the most (if not the most) important objects in your life.So, leaving one behind always makes you apprehensive.For the job at the police warehouse, I was going to be flying the Cherub, but that meant that everyone else had to leave their ships behind.Tess didnt have one, but Mal and Cheyenne were trusting that their ships would be okay in their absence.Back then, Mal was flying a cargo ship, very similar to the Cherub, though made by a different firm.He had cronies, even back then, so he gave it over to them.I never knew what Cheyenne had arranged.Using a single ship had been a good plan, of course.People in the Sick are opportunists.See a few ships together, especially down on the ground, and you have an indication that something is up.Something potentially lucrative.A lone ship, though.That could be someone looking for food.Or making hasty repairs.Or anything.Lone ships are often not worth the trouble.Unless, that is, youre desperate.And of course one ship means less resistance than three.But on this trip the plan was to not be noticed.I stood by the Cherub as the others approached.Mal eyed the ship appraisingly.Still no weapons?he asked.Mal had outfitted his ship, called A Star without a Name, with several weapons he had liberated from military installations.I shook my head.Not my style.People change, Benjamin, he said with a smile.Theres no need for weapons on this job, is there?I asked.Shes fast and she can carry.Thats all that matters.He tilted his head.Whats her name?Tess asked.The Cherub.Cheyenne laughed.What the fuck kind of name is that?she asked.Its named after a type of angel, I said.A smiling, plump, baby angel if Im not wrong, Lord Tess said.I sighed.The cherubim were guardians and divine messengers, winged and terrible.Cherubs guarded the Garden of Eden in the Holy Scripture.They were said to have four wings, like the fins of the ship.Stupid name, Cheyenne muttered.I came very close to throwing them all off of the ship.I had been used to having Claudia and my father aboard the Cherub (toward the end, my father let me fly her) but having four other people made the gondola feel cramped.Even though I was at her controls, I could feel the other people around, behind me, in my air, my space.The Cherubs gondola wasnt small, but it felt like it had been invaded.Somethings been bothering me, I said.Youre saying that this wasnt the first place the police came when the Bug hit?Youd think theyd load for bear.Cheyenne came around to face me.They didnt have a chance, so Im told.They were overrun pretty quickly.And thats all we have to go on?I did the due diligence, Tess said, dropping her weird phrases like she always did.Records seem to indicate that this area was overrun pretty quickly.Other places around the country made good use of their military grade weapons, but at this location, they didnt get a chance to.All those weapons, I thought, and in the end they did no good.I dont like Ferals at the best of times, but at least we know what they are and to some degree how they operate.Back in the Clean, when everything was just starting to go down, they must have been scared out of their minds.Friends, loved ones, comrades in arms, all of a sudden turning into creatures monstrous and violent and, most of all, hungry.At least when Dad Faded I knew what I was dealing with.I had been trained in how to handle myself, in how to handle Ferals.They had no idea.But they soon found out.All right, people, Cheyenne said.Ante up.I groaned.Really?She gave me a chastising look.Its tradition.Which was true.Zep crews would often select personal items or something from their last haul and put it in a communal pool.The person who performed best during the run (determined by communal vote) would get to take it.Dad and I never did that, even with Claudia.We felt that something earned was yours to keep.Didnt make much sense to add gambling to the mix.But on other crews, I suppose it made a kind of sense.It was incentive to go above and beyond.But I often wondered if it didnt also foster resentment.I wouldnt be surprised if more than a few antes led to murder in the dark.Whats the win condition?Claudia asked.Kills and fills, Cheyenne said, meaning the person with the most kills (assuming there were any) and the most haul.Fine, I said.I grabbed an old plastic box and shook out the dust, three plastic pens and an old razor blade.Then I slapped the box down in front of them.Cheyenne dropped in a knifenothing you would want to fight with, but good for utility work, stripping wires, things like that.Tess dropped in a book, of course, but I didnt look at the title.I was too busy trying to figure out what to put in.You couldnt half ass itput in something like the pens I had just discarded.But I wasnt putting in something valuable.The idea of this trip was to come away with extra, not less.Mal, who hadnt really said much or reacted in any way when it was announced, simply reached for a ring on one of his fingers (of which there were severalrings, I mean) and pulled one loose.It was silver, and wide, with a large, green stone in the center.It was, strictly speaking, ornamental, but metal could always be melted down.I decided not to give him shit for it.Claudia went next, dropping in a flareuseful and rare enough to be of value.I wouldnt have done it, but I knew for a fact that she had several more.Which left me.I was on the Cherub, which meant I had access to all of my things.The question was, which thing?It came to me a moment latera bottle of wine.I had found a few with Claudia a few weeks earlier.I could put one in and save the rest.The winner could either drink it or sell it.Either way, it was a good score.I grabbed onea Merlotand put it in the bin.Good, Cheyenne said.Were all set.Lets get moving.Ben, if you would be so good as to take your fat baby up into the air?I gritted my teeth and moved to the controls.As I passed Claudia, I said, I am rethinking this whole thing.She patted my shoulder.Its a little late for that, honey.Yeah.The police facility was in what used to be Arizona.Id only been through that area a few times, but it was striking how the land changed.The mountains here were knobby and red, a far cry from the steep, knife edged, snow covered mountains I was used to, in the Rockies.The colors of everything seemed to change.There was more desert here, too.That was a good thing when it came to Feralsthey werent really equipped to be out in the desert.Dehydration would still kill a Feral dead like it would anyone.But we were headed to the city, and there were bound to be pockets there.It took us a little while to find the police department and a little longer to find the storage facility where they stored their extra equipment.I didnt mind any of thatwe were in the air.But what came next made me nervous.One of the great things about the Cherub, what distinguished her from a lot of other ships (apart from her name, which was excellent), was that she was equipped with VTOL engines.That meant that, unlike a lot of other airships, which had to either stay in the air or needed complicated launch procedures, she could descend right to the ground for easy loading and then rise back up again, easy peasy.Well, not so easyit was hell to maintain those engines, and thankfully my father had taught me how to do a decent job, but for a long time the Cherub was all I had and I took good care of her.The VTOL was what made the Cherub a great choice for this job.If youre loading lots of guns and heavy gear, you want to be able to walk (or roll, even better) the stuff right up the ramp.There were three problems with this, though.The first was that the Cherub was a large ship.She needed a lot of space to set down.Most of the time, there arent airship sized landing areas just waiting around.And anything that might have been open like that back in the Clean would probably be covered in vegetation and crumbling stone and debris and what have you.Problem number two was that bringing down a ship her size was going to alert anything living in the immediate area.Including Ferals.And while animals would likely run away from us, Ferals, being slightly more savvy, would probably come toward, aware that there was a delivery of food coming their way.And that brings me to three.Lets say you have the space to put down and you do, and you avoid or fight your way through any Ferals that come to chew on your face.Then, assuming you leave the ship, shes a nice, big target for anyone who might want to steal her.Back then, I used to have a key to lock her up.That key was later lost, and I dont remember the exact details, but as Tess had mentioned, people like Mal werent going to be stopped by a simple lock.I once installed a passcode lock on the controls.You needed to put in the precise numerical sequence to even turn them on.But I ditched that after a narrow escape where those few seconds almost cost me my life.So I had settled for traps.Sometimes the old ways were the best ways, especially in the Sick.They were nothing too elaborate.You had to watch where you put your hands, how you opened things.And I could enable them or disable them as I wanted.I stopped using them later, after I started working with MirandaI was afraid that theyd get her or one of the other boffins.And of course that was when my ship got stolen.But they were enabled for this job.Where do I put down?I asked.Cheyenne walked over to me and pointed out the gondolas window.Thats the beauty.Just across the street?Theres a field.I looked where she pointed, and she was right.A football field.I had no idea how the sport had been played, but Id seen pictures (once, some video this collector had) and something about the way they suited up had intrigued me.The field was mostly clear and large enough to set the Cherub down.Of course there was still a lot of ground between the field and the police facility.Cheyenne looked at all of us, as if reading our minds.Itll be fine.We land on the field, cover each other to the facility.Its mostly open, good lines of sight.After we get the gear, we look for something with wheels to help.If that crashes, we take as much as we can carry.That should be worth enough.But...But?I asked.She looked at Tess.The manifest I have says that they have armored vehicles inside.If theyre vintage, and nothing is broken ...well, well have our way out, wont we?They have armored vehicles?I asked Tess.She nodded.According to the information I pulled.I shook my head.I guess the Clean wasnt exactly what I thought.I brought the Cherub directly over the football field.Okay.Everybody load up and get ready.There was the sound of weapons being checked.I pulled out my fathers revolver, popped out the chamber, and made sure it was fully loaded.I also had a backup automatic on my hip.Claudia tested her bow and inspected her arrows.Someone will have to cover Lord Tess, Cheyenne said.What?I asked.I dont carry, Lord Tess said.What the fuck?I asked.And you think now was the best time to tell us?Its alright, Claudia said.She gave me a look as if to say, just go with it.Ill cover her.Just move when I tell you to, okay?Okay, Tess said.Okay, Claudia said to me.Okay, I repeated.I set the Cherub down.The howls of Ferals were already echoing across the open space as we descended the Cherubs ramp.I held the revolver in my hand, scanning for any signs of movement.Beside me, Claudia fitted an arrow to her bow.It made me want to grab her and kiss her, but now was definitely not the time.Luckily for us, the field was made out of synthetic grass.Id seen it beforeunnerving that they had such things, but it meant the field wasnt overgrown.Easy place to land, no chance of getting caught up or tripped.I let myself settle into a loose stance, the revolver out, and then they were there, barreling across the open space.I tracked my target, a tall, rangy Feral, male, its long, thin limbs propelling it toward me with worrying speed.I sighted down the barrel.Squeezed the trigger.The Feral still came.I inhaled, sighted, and shot again.The bullet took it in the shoulder as it was coming up from its crouch, spun it around, and threw it backward.I swiveled to another target.Part of me was calmed by the presence of the others.It wasnt that I trusted them (except for Claudia) but they were experienced (except for Tess), and they were covering the places I couldnt coverand for the moment that was enough.I didnt have to look behind me.I suppressed the urge to look behind me.I shot, then shot again, then again and again.The others covered me as I reloaded.The gunshots echoed across the expanse of the football field.Any Ferals in the area would know we were here.That moment of alarm turned to delight as I watched Feral after Feral fall.They should know we were here.Should know that we carried thunder.Should know they were coming to their deaths.The moment of triumph swelled, and then collapsed.Cheyenne, pulling back to reload, slipped on the wet turf and went down on one knee.Mal was also reloading, and suddenly a hole opened up.Ferals are stupid, but not so stupid that they cant sense weakness, and a few of them curved around to come in on that side.And just like that, our order fell to chaos.I had just enough time to swerve the revolver around at a dark skinned, female Feral that was springing toward me.The shot clipped it and stopped it for a moment, but it wasnt down.Then there was another, then another.Fuck!I heard behind me, but it wasnt Claudias voice.I shot down a young Feral male, dancing away from where it crawled at me.Then another two shots to take the female down for good.Then I was dry.I turned my head for a split second to see what was happening beside me.Scared, anxious faces.Lots of bullets (and arrows) in the air.Then it was on me.For a moment, my brain couldnt make sense of things.This person had clothes ona leather jacket.The tatters of a scarf.But survival instincts kicked in shortly afterward.I slammed the empty revolver into the side of its head and threw it to one side.Recently Faded.And no time to reload.I did something that I dont normally do.I moved toward it, kicking out with my boot, trying to get some space.I was closer than I ever liked to be, and not armed, and I wanted this thing away.I kicked again, but it dodged my foot, and then I was tipping backward.I hit the ground with my side, and I saw the thing pressing back on its legs, about to jump, and A bullet took it in the head.On an angle so that the spray went wide of where I lay.I looked back quickly to see Mal pointing his gun in my direction.I got back to my feet, took the moment to slap a few bullets into the revolver, then turned and fired at whatever Ferals I could find.It was loud and messy and then ...it was over.Bodies littered the ground.My breath was loud behind my scarf.I counted five of us.All standing.Of course the bulk of my concern was for Claudia.She was breathing hard but seemed uninjured.For a moment, we just stood there, catching our breath, then it was back to reality.Our rational brains quickly took over.I nodded to Claudia, then began checking her for any wounds or blood spray.She did the same to me.She gave me the all clear a moment before I did the same for her.Then I turned and saw Cheyenne.Or, rather, Tess and Mal looking at Cheyenne.What?I asked.She has blood on her gloves, Tess said.One got too close, Cheyenne said.I had to hit it to get it to back off.Are the gloves intact?I asked.Cheyenne held her gloves out, and I could see the dark stain on them.Get them off!I said.She peeled one back with one glove, then gingerly pulled off the other one with a handkerchief she pulled from her pocket, letting it drop on the ground as if it burned her.I moved closer, examining her hands.She held them out, flipped them over.I didnt see any blood.But I didnt touch her.That was always the hardest partI might have checked her hands, checked for broken skin, cracked nailbeds, anywhere the Bug might have snuck its way in.Just because I didnt see blood didnt mean a microscopic drop didnt get through.But, getting close, running my hands, gloved as they were, over her, might just bring me one step closer to Fading myself.It was safer to just keep an eye on her.Prep to put a bullet in her at the first sign of strange behavior.But right then there might have been a bomb in our midst, just waiting to go off.Im clean, Cheyenne said, almost as if convincing herself.Im clean.I looked at Claudia, who just raised her eyebrows.I knew what she was thinking.This was getting better all the time.Lets move, she said at last.She led us around the corpses of the Ferals, then on to the building ahead of us.Claudia noticed the look on my face and touched my shoulder.Itll be fine, she said.Well be in and out before anyone has a chance to Fade.I nodded.Thats what I was trying to focus onget into the facility, grab the gear, get back to the Cherub, and put down Cheyenne (on the ground, I mean) as soon as possible.Otherwise, wed be putting her down in another way.Of course thinking about Fading reminded me about the last person who Faded in front of memy father.It also reminded me of my cowardice.How it took me by surprise, and all I could do was grab for him, my fingers tangled in his Star of David necklace.Then, as reality hit me, what had been drilled into me my whole life kicked in and I turned and ran.Left him, or what was left of him, swirling into an abyss of mindlessness.But thats not the sin at hand.Mal had the heaviest load.We mostly carried empty bags for the loot, but he had his lock picking tools in his large bag, and so we stayed close to him.What are you really doing here?I asked him.Whatever do you mean, Benjamin?You dont need this score, I said.You hit installations like this all the time.I know youre well stocked on weapons and ammunition.He stopped for a moment and looked at me.Theres no such thing, Benjamin.One day its going to be up to us to form a new civilization.Not this scattered series of jobs and searches.Not the day to day survival that we all do.Were going to need to build something, and that something is going to need defending.So, yes, I do need this score.He started moving again, then said back over his shoulder.We all do.I was still digesting this when I heard howls off in the distance, a sharp cry of ...something?Hunger?Rage?Lust?I dont understand Ferals that much.Ahead of us, the building that Cheyenne had indicated got closer.But not close enough.I still had the revolver down at my side, and I was scanning around me along with everyone else.But we kept moving.We covered the distance without any more Ferals attacking us, and then we were at the door to the facility.Mal set down his bag and unzipped it, pulling out his tools, and the rest of us set up a perimeter around him, guns still out, as protection.I started counting in my head, then stopped almost immediately.It was just setting my nerves on edge.I didnt like waiting, out in the open.It was something I avoided as much as I could.I kept flicking my gaze back to Claudia.She stood, straight, poised, ready.It made me feel better.Having her watch my back always made me feel better.I covered my section of the perimeter, but it was trickier here than it had been at the football field.There were cars outside the police station, and they had been overgrown with vines and vegetation.I had to make sure to keep my eyes not only between them, but underneath as well.A Feral could emerge from anywhere.Sweat started trickling.I had a wool cap on my head and safety goggles and my scarf up, but somehow it still fell between the gaps.There was nothing to do about it, though.I wanted to turn and look to see how far Mal had gotten, but I kept my eyes straight.It was maddening.Thats the thing about the ground, the fight with yourself is often more important than fighting off Ferals.Brave the ground without discipline, and you were asking to be infected.Then I caught it.Movement, off behind a rusted heap that used to be a car.I raised my revolver and watched, hoping to catch it again.Nothing.Nothing.Then ...something.I signaled to Claudia, silently, then moved toward it.She would have my back, and hopefully the others would change their style of cover to make sure that they picked up the slack.I moved, slowly but without hesitation.If it was a Feral, it didnt seem to be hunting.Hunting Ferals screamed and attacked almost fearlessly.For a moment I wondered if it could be some kind of smart Feral, and that was almost too much to consider so I let it go.I inched forward, gun out, used the car for cover, and carefully pivoted so I could see (and shoot if necessary) what was beyond it.It was a Feral, and my finger moved to the trigger but ...then I paused.Something was different here.The Feral was on all fours, moving back and forth in the space between the cars.I couldnt tell what sex it was.Long hair hung around its face, it had no real breasts to speak of, and whatever genitals it had were hidden between its legs.But it moved in an odd, jerky fashion, and sometimes it would stop and its head would arc, almost painfully, in one direction.Injured?I didnt see any open wounds on the creature.As my heartbeat slowed a bit, I thought I heard it snuffling.Then a kind of whining wheeze, soft, but as it looked around.What the fuck was this thing?I wanted to shoot it.I wanted to do it so badly that I had to actively restrain myself from raising my arm and pulling the trigger.But that was the stupid move.A shot would alert any others around that there was food nearby.Instead, making sure I wasnt within reach of the thing, I signaled to Claudia to use her bow.It was quiet enough and would take out the creature quite easily.She moved around to where she could hit the thing.Then, whether it was Claudia accidentally stepping on something, or me, or nothing in particular at all, the Feral looked up.It saw Claudia there, bow outstretched.And it just gave that whine again, jerking its head to the side again.No snarl, no growl, no threatening gestures at all.I think that startled Claudia because she paused for a moment.In that moment, the thing could have leapt forward.Claudias shot might have gone wide, and it could have been on her, or me, before either of us could react.Only it didnt.It stayed in that same position, head jerked to one side, that kind of whining sound coming out of it.Then Claudia put an arrow through its eye and the Feral jerked back, striking the ground, and was still.Exhaling, I gave her a thumbs up as we returned to the group, but the thought of that Feral stayed with me.I assumed it had been injured at some point.Ferals were susceptible to the same kinds of things that humans were, and some of them were born with problems, but it was pretty well known that if an individual in the pack wasnt healthy enough to hunt or survive on its own, it was usually killed.And eaten.By its own pack.That this one had survived, and how, was a mystery.I thought about that as Mal worked to open the door.Then, after a while of watching and waiting, Claudia signaled to me that it was done.The door was open.Our prize awaited.Getting to the goods was surprisingly simple.Inside the outer door was a small entryway with what looked like a guard post or reception area surrounded by glass.Then, beyond, guarded by a few more locks, was a large warehouse.Mal got us through the locks, and then we searched the warehouse, alert, most of all, for any signs of Ferals.We found none.What we did find, well, it was a haul for the ages.There were weapons, both small and large, and plenty of ammunition.Armored clothing and protective gear, including helmets and large shields.And, most impressive of all, large armored vehicles, the type that seemed should belong in a military base or stalled somewhere after the Bug hit, pitted with rust and overgrown with vegetation.Their hard, black shells were covered in dust, but I could see the beauty beneath.Like massive, black insectsand everyone knew that insects were some of the hardiest creatures around.Lord Tess whistled when she saw everything.I didnt say anything, but my eyes were wider than I can ever remember them being.Claudia found my hand with hers and gave it a squeeze.Lets get this all loaded and ready to go, Mal said.It snapped everybody to attention, and we began loading duffle bags and backpacks and everything we brought with us.I focused on the smaller arms and rifles since I was most familiar with them.Also grabbed for some grenades and other explosives.Then I decided to shift focus to the vehicles.They werent just impressive, they were valuable.Something like that, fully operational, would be a godsend on the ground, impervious to Feral attacks, and with enough firepower to cover any entrances or exits.I ran to one and pulled open the door.For all its age, it looked virtually unused.They definitely hadnt been able to use this when the shit went down.I climbed into the drivers seat and was immediately bewildered.It was a good deal more complicated than your usual car or truck, which I had learned how to use early onsometimes they need to be cleared from the roads, and sometimes theyre useful for transporting hauls to a ship.I called over to Tess, asking her to come in.Can you figure this out?I asked.She smiled.Piece of cake.I helped her into the seat and then went back to what I was doing.That was Tesss valueshe knew stuff from the Clean.Knew technology, history, how things worked.She made it her business to be an expert on that world, and it made her useful to the people trying to pick amongst its scraps.I filled another bag, and then another.I recognized one of the items as a launcher, used to fire explosives.That went in the bag, too.Benjamin!Tess called.I ran over to where she sat, her coat bunched up around her.What happened?Her smile made lines on the sides of her eyes and mouth.Turn it.She pointed.I reached for the key set firmly in the ignition and I turned it.For a moment, nothing happened, and then the engine coughed to life and emitted a loud, aggressive rumble.I smiled.Good work.She made a mock bow from her seat.I told you I had it.We can load this up and ride it out, I said to the others.If we can drive it around those cars out there, I can get it up the Cherubs ramp.Cheyenne nodded.Its a good idea.Mal frowned.If we can get it out.Ill check, I said.The warehouse had two bay doors for the vehicles to be driven out of, but there was no real way of knowing what lay on the other side.I would have to go out the front and circle around to the doors to see what was there or else figure out another way to get the vehicles out.I moved to Claudia.Can you continue this without me?Im going to check out whats on the other side of those doors.By yourself?Ill be quieter by myself, I said.Besides, I need you to keep pulling loot.I want to win that fucking ante.You know two of those things are ours, right?Its the principle of the thing.So I do all the work while you go for a stroll.I smiled at her.If I get the vehicle, were a lock for the win.Just be careful, she said.I will, I said.And then I grabbed her ass.It was brash, but I was feeling, I dont know, something wild and buoyant inside of me.Since my father died, things had been a struggle.I had Claudia, of course, and she was great, but something had been missing.For me, at least.This was, well, the biggest score I had ever seen.Just the barter from this one score would keep the Cherub in repairs for as long as I would need.It would keep Claudia and me fed for a while.And the loot itself could be used if necessary.You never turned your back on weapons and ammunition.So I was feeling good.Accomplished.Successful.As I turned to go, Claudia grabbed my ass, and I smiled.And yet, while that excitement propelled me to that front set of doors, the moment I stepped out into fresh air, that feeling, the weight of the world and what it was, fell down on me.Hard.And most of that fire guttered out.Not all of it.But most of it.And I suddenly regretted going out alone.I couldnt bring myself to go back in.Not with that group.Maybe if it had been just Claudia and me, but I wasnt going to show weakness in front of the others, so I moved around the building.As quickly, as quietly, and as questingly as I could.I stuck close to the storage facility, hugging the wall so that I had something solid against my back, the revolver down at my side, held firmly and ready for use.One side of the building, then another, passed by without any other movement.I lowered my scarf a bit so my ears were less covered.So I could hear anything coming toward me.Howls, snuffling, the slap of feet against the asphalt.Anything.Those moments are always the worst.You feel dangled like bait, out in the world, daring a hungry Feral to take a bite.Crossing those two walls, all I heard was the hiss of my breath, the thumping of my heartbeat, and the calls of distant birds.That was one of the difficulties listening for any signs of dangerthere were always animals about, it seemed.Birds, wolves, packs of wild dogs.Except for the birds, Id want to avoid any of them.Finally I reached the far side where the large doors were set.There were a few old cars in the way, and the rusted, old hulk of a truck arrowing in from one side.But it wasnt completely blocked.If we could roll a few of the cars a few meters in one direction or the other, we should be able to get through.All the way to the Cherub.A smile curled my lips for a moment.Then faded when I realized I now had to go all the way back.So I retraced my steps, the revolver still at my side, my eyes and ears still alert.Straining, tense, every step of the way.Each moment that passed was a relief.Ground gained.A minor victory.And as I neared the front of the building, I felt, I dont know, triumphant.But as I approached the entrance to the building, something seemed off.I couldnt actually tell what it was at the timejust something itched at my brain.As I neared the door, I heard raised voices.The door was slightly open, too, not completely closed like it had been when Id left.I opened it to a male voice, deep, gruff.Not Mal.Someone I didnt recognize.THREE Days pass in my cell on the Phoenix, and Im not even sure how many.There are more than a handful of scratches on my mattress, but Ive been a little inconsistent with that.The only good from all of this is that Ive been healing.Slowly but surely.It no longer hurts to breathe or move or sleep, and one of the few things I can do to pass the time is exercise.Its as Im doing some wobbly push ups on some indeterminable day that the knock comes on my cell door.I stand up and move away from it.It opens to admit Mal, flanked by two of his peoplerough looking men with rifles slung over their shoulders.Mal nods, and the men grab me, each one on my arm, dragging me to the door.Mal?Dont struggle, Benjamin, he says.
