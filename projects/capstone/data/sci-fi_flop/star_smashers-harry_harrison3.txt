three ...two ...one...HACK!"And a firm thumb was thrust home on the activator button.Once again that strange sensation plucked at the very fiber of their beings as the kappa radiation hurled them headlong into the lambda dimension to emerge once again in normal space.And the engines stopped."I think we're a leetle high," Jerry laughed, looked at the green globe of the planet far below them."But gravity will bring us down quick enough. "Chuck was squinting out of the window, a quizzical expression pulling at his features."Funny," he muttered,  "but I don't see the Moon. ""Not only that," John answered, a look of concentration marked on his face, "but the constellations just aren't right. "They nodded silent agreement, and when Jerry spoke, he spoke for them all."I hate to say it, guys, but I'm afraid that isn't Earth down there.Not only that, but I'm afraid it isn't even any planet in our solar system.Perhaps something has gone wrong with the cheddite projector.I'll check it out. ""No," John said huskily.He was staring at the sensitive radar altimeter like a bird petrified by a snake, sweat suddenly bursting out on his brow."I'm afraid I goofed.All those years behind the iron curtain didn't really do me any good.Jerry, you told me to sound off when the altlmeter hit thirty thousand feet, right?""Bang on. ""Well, and I hate to say this gang, all the planes I have ever flown have always had altlmeters that read in meters, so I converted feet to meters and let you know when we hit that spot. ""Approximately one third of our needed altitude," Jerry intoned in a hollow voice."Still inside the deep atmosphere which interferes with the kappa radiation. "John was no longer smiling as he uneasily eyed the great, cocked fist of Chuck that was slowly being drawn back into firing position.Jerry came between them and calmed them down."Easy does it.Anyone can make a mistake  and we've gotten out of worse pinches before.Remember that old king of the Titanians and what happened to him!"They all laughed at that memory, and the tension was eased.John lowered his head, chagrined."Gee, I'm sorry.Something must have snapped inside my head for me to goof up like that.We'll get out of this.Land on that planet, align the cheddite projector, then take off, and home we go!""And we can put some more ice in the head with Sally.She'll keep OK. "After that it was just waiting as they fell.The cabin heaters were on, and fresh Titanian oxygen was being pumped into the air, and soon they could peel off the extra layers of clothing.Chuck found some cans of cola, and they thawed and drank them, pretending not to notice when John poured seven miniatures of bourbon into his.They knew he felt bad about the mistake, and they were good enough sports not to rub it in.More frozen oxygen was packed in with Sally, still exhibiting a look of frozen horror, and they took turns grabbing a little shut eye, not knowing what would befall them on the planet ever growing larger below.When the first wisps of atmosphere began to whistle against the skin of the ship, Chuck took the controls and waggled them."Almost there.Better strap in because this might be a bit rough.I think we picked up some velocity in the fall. "They certainly had.Air tore at the wings until the edges began to glow and the deicer boots burned away.Chuck stayed rock firm at the wheel and sent them bouncing in a great arc out into space again only to fall back once more into the atmosphere.Again and again he did this until their great speed was slowed to under a thousand miles per hour, and only then did he let the ship sink deeper into the atmosphere."Oceans, continents," Jerry said."Almost like Earth.Makes you kind of homesick. ""That big continent, the one there," John said, pointing."I think that one looks the most like North America. ""Sure enough," Chuck agreed."And that's the way we are going to head. "Heavy cloud layers covered the continent in question as they swooped in low over what could have been one on Earth  how far away now!A great storm center seemed to be active here and Jerry pulled up to go over the top of it.Apparently thunderstorms were worse on this planet than on Earth, for lightning glared and exploded continually within the clouds and the rumble of thunder could be heard even through the insulated cabin walls.They went on seeking clear weather on the far side of the immense storm."Good news, guys," Jerry chortled."I've turned off the oxygen flow since this atmosphere seems to have more than enough to run the engines on. ""You know," Chuck mused, "there is something kind of funny about that thunder and lightning.If the idea wasn't so downright dim and stupid I would almost say that " The great 747 bucked suddenly, and there was a solid thud felt through the metal fabric and a hole more than a yard in diameter appeared in the port wing.   "those were explosions out there, shells and bombs and stuff, as though a war were going on. "While he mused over this, Jerry had pulled back on the wheel and fed full power to the engines and the leviathan of the skies roared up and away from the tumult below."I don't think we should mix in a war," John opined.Jerry nodded agreement."Particularly since that hole in the wing ruptured our main fuel tank and we only have about fifteen minutes' fuel left. ""That is annoying," Chuck agreed."Better buckle your seat belts, guys," and he turned on the 'seat belts' and 'no smoking' signs as he said this.The Pleasantville Eagle clawed its way back into the sky reaching for altitude to stretch its meager fuel supply to the upmost, fighting to clear the immense area of the strange battlefield below.They were above the clouds, droning away merrily, while the fuel needles loudly clicked, one by one, against their bottom pins.Then came the moment they had awaited and feared as, one by one, the greedy engines sucked in the last drops of fuel, then gurgled and gasped into silence.The instant the powerful thrust stopped the ship fell off into a dive, plunged toward the woolly clouds below it, diving into their misty embrace.None of the three comrades said anything, but if pulses hammered faster and jaws were clenched more firmly, who was to blame them?Anything could be waiting below the clouds.What was waiting, they saw when they plunged through the bottom of the fleecy layer, was not very much of anything at all.From horizon to horizon, shadowed by the thick clouds above, lay a sandy waste barren of life of any kind."I don't think we should land down there," John said, speaking for all of them.Jerry stretched the glide with all his considerable talent, but though he could fight, he could not win against the inexorable grip of gravity that clutched at the 747 with greedy fingers.The featureless desert flashed by below them, ever closer, and dimly far ahead a range of mountains appeared."Quick, the glasses!"Chuck exclaimed, leaning forward and peering intently into the distance.John slapped them into his hand, and in an instant he had them trained on the ground."There's a fort there of some kind, I can see a flag waving over it, and explosions all around it, more fighting I guess.Yes, there are vehicles of some kind circling it, firing, and guns on the wall firing back.I can see the defenders now!Why, they're almost human except maybe they have an extra couple of arms, but what does that matter!""Who are they fighting?"Jerry asked, concentrating firmly on the controls."Hard to tell  wait  one of their cars just got blown over, the driver is crawling out and ...ugggh!""Ugggh?""That's the word for it.A thing with a sort of repulsive purplish yellow body like a tree trunk with sort of openings all over it, four legs like smaller tree trunks and black tentacles sprouting on top where a real person would have a head. ""Well that's enough for me!"Jerry shouted for them all."We just have to come in on the side of the humanoids  "and show those uggghs what real humans can do. ""Right!"Chuck agreed."But what can we do?""You've got a point there.Any ideas, guys?"It was John, trained spy and saboteur, who quickly came up with the answer."All the seats dismount easily.Make a turn and come back over the enemy and we'll show them what men can do against those purple scum. "And show them they did.As the Pleasantville Eagle swooped down like its avenging namesake, from the opened emergency doors on each side dropped a stream of metal seats.Dropped straight and true as though aimed by computing bombsights, each seat plunging headlong onto one of the fleeing vehicles.And the ruse worked.It was not obvious how much damage the chairborne attack had done, but it had apparently broken the spirit of the enemy, for they now fled with their tentacles tucked between their legs, across the desert to vanish in the range of hills.Cheers broke out in the cabin, and through the whistling slipstream, echoing cheers could be heard from the defenders below.Jerry whipped the plane about in a tight turn and with their last bit of speed brought the Eagle safely home to roost on the smooth desert floor, braking to a stop in the shadow of the fort's high walls."Here," Jerry said, passing on the electric razor to the others after he had used it."Let's neaten up, give these guys the right impression. "They all agreed on this, and by the time they had used deodorant too and brushed the last green stain of Titanian ichor from their clothing, combed their hair and renewed Sally's frozen oxygen a reception committee was waiting for them at the foot of the folding stairway that automatically slipped out of the plane's side when the entrance was opened.Step by step they descended to the historical moment when humanoid met humanoid for the first time across the trackless oceans of space.Each group examined the other with unabashed curiosity.What the aliens saw was, of course, the three Americans.What the Americans saw were three aliens.They had very smooth, white, shining skin, and when the first one raised his steel helmet in greeting, they saw that the humanoids were hairless as well.The pupils of their eyes were shaped like the number 8 and were bright pink.They wore no clothes but instead were draped about with a leather harness from which were suspended a number of weapons as well as other items not easily identifiable.Then, upon a shouted signal from their leader  the one in front whose helmet was gold instead of black like the others  they pulled out their swords and raised them in salute.The three Americans jumped to attention and returned the salute snappily, although John raised his clenched fist first before remembering and quickly touching his forefinger to his brow, hand and forearm straight, longest way up and shortest way down, like the others.Then the steel of the swords rasped back into the scabbards, and the leader stepped forward:  "Sdrah stvoo ee tyeh," he gurgled in a deep voice."Though we are strangers from across the deeps of space and do not speak your fine though incomprehensible language, nevertheless we come in peace and bring you greetings from the men of planet Earth, and particularly the United States," Jerry answered."Daw braw yeh oo traw," John said."He was just saying hello in Russian, and I told him good morning back. ""Jumping Jehoshaphat," Chuck whispered."You don't think they're Commies, do you?"They all stepped backward cautiously."No Commies," the leader said, smiling a toothless grin, since he had a bony ridge instead of teeth, and raising his helmet again in greeting."We are the Ormoloo who battle against the repulsive Garnishee from whom you saved us and for which we will be internally grateful. ""You speak English pretty well for an Ormoloo," Jerry said."For many years our powerful radio receivers have been picking up radio transmissions from your planet, and we have studied them and have learned your language.Men of Earth and of the great country the United States of America, I return your greetings and welcome you in peace to our planet Domite.Everything we have is at your disposal on this most momentous occasion.A banquet has been prepared in your honor, and we beg you to grace our table with your noble democratic presences. ""Lead the way," Chuck said, and they did.The three Earthmen looked around with wonder at the inside of the fort.In some way it was very much like a desert fort on Earth with plastered walls and a crenellated top above the firing step.But here the resemblance ended, for the Ormoloo had a fantastic assortment of strange weapons, some of which defied description.They then and there determined to examine these later to see how they worked.The leader, who had introduced himself as Steigen Sterben, turned and smiled his toothless grin back at them."Later you must examine our weapons and see how they work," he said.They nodded agreement and entered the banquet hall, where each was conducted to a place of honor at the long table.The table was bare except for a clay bowl before each place filled with cool water.After they were all seated, Steigen Sterben raised his hand and all of the heads were lowered as he spoke."Oh, Great Spirit who lives in the Other World above, we thank you for what you have provided. "The prayer over, they raised their heads, and Chuck nudged Jerry in the ribs and whispered."They must be great guys, with religion and everything," and Jerry agreed.Now the waiters appeared carrying great baskets, and with three pronged tines, they scooped out mounds of what looked like green grass and deposited them on the bare table before each diner.As soon as they had all been served, Steigen Sterben signaled, and they all fell to with a will, bending over and munching up mouthfuls of the grass.All except the three Earthmen, who were not sure what to do until Jerry broke the ice and picked up some of it and put it in his mouth and chewed and swallowed quickly, then drained his water bowl."Jumping horseflies," he whispered, "That grass is grass. ""I see you are not eating," Steigen Sterben said."I must apologize for our simple fare, but we Ormoloo are strict vegetarians, for religious principles of course, and never vary our diet. ""Well, some of my best friends are vegetarians," Jerry rushed to explain so no insult would be felt."But we guys here we're, well, omnivores for the most part.But go ahead and eat, don't let us stop you. ""No insult felt," Steigen Sterben mumbled through a luscious mouthful."We'll be through pretty soon. "The three companions looked around at the blank walls and sipped their water, and sure enough, inside of a minute the Ormoloo had finished their banquet, the last blade lapped up and the table licked clean."Let me tell you about this war," Steigen Sterben lowed, licking a last green fragment from his lips."For over ten thousand of your Earth years we have been locked in this struggle, for the Garnishee are ruthless demons and would kill us all, horribly, if they had their way.So back and forth the war rages, for we are evenly matched, and it appears it will go on for ten thousand years more. ""Would you mind my asking why you are fighting?"Chuck asked."No, I wouldn't. ""Why are you fighting?""We fight to maintain our free way of life, to worship the Great Spirit in our own manner and to wipe out to the last evil individual of the hideous Garnishee. ""Would you mind my asking why you dislike them?"Jerry said."I mean other than the fact they are pretty nasty looking and all that. ""I hesitate to tell you, to profane your ears with the horrors of their way of life. ""We can take it, "John said, speaking for them all."Rather than tell you, for it is hard to speak the unspeakable, let me show you. "At a signal the lights dimmed, and a hidden movie projector sprang to life, using one white wall as a screen.Strange music sobbed and wailed, and credits and titles in an unknown script appeared.The film was in color and seemed to be well made, except that the voice over was in a totally incomprehensible language.When the credits ended, the three friends gasped because the speaker was a disgusting Ormoloo, with all his repulsive details in living color.His black tentacles waved, and it could be seen that one of the openings in the central trunk was a mouth that opened and closed.A ring of eyes ran around what would have been the creature's waist, had it had a waist."Ugly beggar," Jerry said, and the others nodded agreement."Not only that," Steigen Sterben said, "but they smell very badly as well. "Now the creature on the screen rose, and picking up a stick, it stumped over on its four postlike legs to a diagram, which it began to point at with the stick.The diagram was a simple drawing of an Ormoloo with dotted lines across many different parts of his body."What does it mean?"John asked."Unhappily"  Steigen Sterben sighed  "you will find out quickly enough. "They did, indeed, find out quickly enough.The scene changed, and a dead Ormoloo was stretched out on a wooden block while the speaker sawed him apart with a powerful bandsaw."Enough!"Jerry shouted, springing to his feet and knocking over his chair.The film vanished, and the lights came back on.Steigen Sterben sat with head lowered and, finally, explained in a hushed voice."This was what I dared not speak of.The Garnishee seek only to capture us and eat us, for they are monsters. ""Monsters indeed!"Chuck roared, jumping up and knocking over his chair."I know I speak for us all when I say that we will give you every aid within our power to wipe these fiends from the face of your fair planet!"All the Earthmen nodded solemn agreement, and as one, the Ormoloo jumped to their feet and saluted and cheered themselves hoarse, shouting, "Hip, hip, HOORAY!"over and over again."And I think I know a way to do that," Jerry said thoughtfully."I am considering a weapon far stronger than anything you have here, a weapon I could build that would wipe out your enemies to the last fiend. ""You wouldn't," Steigen Sterben said, smiling broadly and putting a friendly arm or two around Jerry's shoulders, "care to tell me about it, would you, old man?""Not just yet.I have to work some bugs out of it before I do that.But first we have something more pressing to worry about.Before the frozen oxygen runs out, we have to do something about Sally. ""Could I examine your hospital?"John asked."Of course," Steigen Sterben said, "but you must not expect it to be up to the fine standards of a hospital like your Pleasantville General Hospital and Rest Home.... ""You've heard about that here?"Chuck gasped."Of course.I listened to the radio program myself about its unique modern wonders and remember it clearly.That is why I say ours are crude by comparison.You see we Ormoloo have no pain nerves or bloodstream as you do. "To prove the point he drew his sword and plunged it through the body of the Ormoloo next to him who never batted an eyelid but went on licking a grass blade from his hand.When the sword came out, only a tiny hole could be seen that instantly sealed up."Our blood goes from cell to cell by osmosis so we need neither heart nor blood vessels.Also, our bodies are very resistant to infections.Our hospitals are, well, just a sort of wooden table, a couple of knives and saws and a lot of needles and thread.If parts are too damaged to save, we hack them off, that's about all. ""Yes, I understand," John mused."But I had something a little more complex in mind for Sally.Look  you must have machine shops and tools, things like that?""Of course.There is a complete machine shop here for servicing our weapons and machines. ""Then that's the answer.I can make the instruments I will need; it won't take long.I'll fix things up while you guys get Sally in here. "He was as good as his word, for no sooner had the two others put on their insulated gloves and carried Sally in from the refrigerated john than they found him in the middle of a well equipped hospital room."I'll need some help.Are either of you up to assisting?""I have a graduate degree in open heart surgery," Chuck said."Will that help?""Good.You can pass me the instruments.What about you, Jerry?""My only graduate medical degree is in proctology, so maybe I better just watch. "The newly built revasculator pumped, throbbed and gurgled, the hysterisis anniliilator hissed, the corpuscular reconstitutor clicked passionately  and all these machines under the deft control of John, who indeed was a master surgeon.Beneath his tender ministrations Sally's tender body, still clad in the remnants of her gay summer frock, relaxed and lost the glassy frozen look.Within minutes she had softened a good deal, though, of course, her heart was not beating, nor was she breathing."The intravascular oxygenator is supplying oxygen directly to her brain cells," John said calmly, while his hands flashed busily about their tasks."As you know if the blood supply to the brain is cut off for more than two minutes, the brain begins to deteriorate, and even if the patient lives, it will be only as a mindless husk.We can only hope that Sally froze quickly back there on Titan, or she will be a beautiful but mindless husk.Now, stand back if you please, for I shall apply two hundred and thirty volts of direct current with these paddles directly to her heart which will surprise it into beating again, and she will, I hope, be restored to young and vital life. "The paddles were applied, the switch thrown, Sally's body contracted with the shock, and she leaped a yard into the air.When she came down, her eyes were wide open, and she put her knuckles to her mouth and screamed loudly over and over again."Husk.... "Both the young men who loved her sighed."Perhaps not," said John, injecting a note of hope into what appeared to be an inevitable and tragic occasion."Perhaps she was frozen so fast her memory was frozen as well, and she thinks she is still a prisoner of the loathsome Titanians. ""It's us, Sally," Jerry said hopefully."You're safe, do you hear that, safe!"She looked around her, dazedly, her eyes still empty of anything resembling intelligence.7  A GREAT VICTORY BUT TRAGEDY STRIKES  "Well, thanks for trying, John," Jerry said wearily."Yeah," Chuck added in the same gloom ridden tone of voice."You did your best.But it was just too late.She is a hapless vegetable forever. ""Vegetable, my foot," Sally said angrily."What on earth are you talking about?And what happened to those loathsome Titanians that were here just a moment ago?""It worked!"they shouted in unison, and there was a great deal of hugging, backslapping and furtive knuckling of tears from eye corners.Once the hysterical moment was over they explained to Sally, in detail, what had happened.They had but one question, and Jerry phrased it for all of them."We have only one question.Why did you open the plane door and let the Titanians in?""They knocked three times, and you told me to open the door at three knocks.That's a foolish question," she sniffed, and they dared not disagree with her."In any case it's nice that it all ended the way it did and all.And I'm really not sorry I missed most of.it.Frankly I'm rather glad I was frozen by the time the Titanian king was caressing my limbs with his tentacles because I should not have liked that at all.So  when do we go back to Earth?""As soon as we have destroyed all of the disgusting carnivorous Garnishee," Jerry said stalwartly."We can do at least that for these fine people here.And I must align the cheddite projector, and to do that I must find out where we are. ""This is the planet Domite which circles the star Proxima Centauri," Steigen Sterben said, entering the operating room."After dark you will be able to see the nearby double star of Alpha Centauri, the smaller companion of which is almost identical with the primary of your own solar system. ""He speaks pretty good English for a bald guy with four arms," Sally said, impressed."Steigen Sterben at your service, dear Miss Sally.It is a pleasure to have you among us in revived form.Now, Mr.Jerry, if I could be so bold as to ask you about the weapon you had proposed constructing that would destroy once and for all our disgusting enemies.Is it ready?""It will be as soon as we have built a vacuum chamber.Sooner or later we will have to use the cheddite projector in an atmosphere, so it might as well be sooner.If we build it into a portable vacuum chamber, I will show you how this miracle of transportation can also be used as a humane weapon to end your millennia old war once and for all. ""All our facilities, needless to say, are completely at your disposal. "While Sally went to make herself some new clothes to replace the torn summer frock she had been frozen in, the three companions brought the cheddite projector from the Pleasantville Eagle and labored to build it into a portable vacuum chamber.Or rather two of them did.Chuck stopped once to think and stood, deep in thought, for almost twenty minutes.He was in the way, so they stood him in the corner while they worked.Twenty minutes later, to the second, his eyes refocused, and he turned to them with grave tones."I hate to say it, but I think there is something slightly fishy about our four armed friend Steigen Sterben. ""Other than some strange eating habits," Jerry said, "I don't think there is anything wrong with old S S. ""Then listen.If we are on a planet of the star Proxima Centauri  how far are we from Earth?""Four point three light years," Jerry snapped back instantly."Give or take a few miles. ""Check.Now when was the Pleasantville General Hospital and Rest Home built?""Two years ago ...but...of course!We've been tricked!""I don't dig you, man," John said sourly."It's obvious.Steigen Sterben said he heard about the hospital from a radio broadcast.Yet since radio waves disperse at the speed of light, the broadcast about the hospital will not arrive here for over two years more!""I admit to a slight deception, ha ha, but it was only done in the name of friendship," Steigen Sterben said, slipping into the room and smiling his toothless grin at them.The grin faded when the three men closed in on him, fists clenched."You lied to us," Jerry snapped out."You are a mind reader, aren't you?""Just a little," he admitted, raising his four hands palms outward, while shrinking back at the same time."Please let me explain.I meant no harm.We have simple mental powers of perception, being able to read surface thoughts, but not deeply.I saw that a creature on the moon you just left knew your language from radio broadcasts, so foolishly, I said that, feeling you would not like to have your minds read.Yes, I read in your minds now that you do not like having your minds read.So I will stop.I lied only for the greater cause of freedom. ""We can't beat up on him for that, I guess," Jerry said, lowering his fist, as did the others."So I guess we'll have to go along with him. "He turned and shook his finger at Steigen Sterben."But no mind reading without permission, do you hear?We like a bit of privacy. "Steigen Sterben looked at him in puzzlement."Why do you shake your finger at me?"he asked."I do not know what you say since I am not reading your mind. ""You're an honest old coot," Jerry said shaking his hand, and Chuck and John shook his hand too at the same time, which they could do and even have one left over.Jerry tapped his head and pointed at the puzzled Ormoloo, who finally understood and read his mind."Very happy that peace is restored," he smiled toothlessly."From now on I shall only read your minds when you tap on the side of your head like that.In such manner will communication be established and privacy maintained.Now tell me  is this device you are constructing completed yet?""Just about to try it out. "Chuck waved."The tank is evacuated and the cheddite projector aligned.Now I set the controls on the outside of the tank. "He did so, squinting through the open window at the mountain range nearby."They're all ready.A push of the button will activate it and I leave that up to you, S S, you four armed, bald, toothless, friendly old coot. ""I will be grateful for eternity.But what will happen?""Just look at the mountains and press. "He did, and blinked quickly."Am I having eye trouble or did I just see a forty five thousand foot snowcapped mountain peak vanish completely?""You're not just snapping your mouth bones!"Jerry chortled."The explanation is extremely simple.That mountain peak was enveloped by the kappa radiation and slipped into the lambda dimension and dropped out of the lambda dimension right over the middle of that big ocean back there.I'll bet the fish were surprised!""I'll bet the Garnishee will be surprised when they drop into that ocean. "He grinned, and they all laughed together, but suddenly Steigen Sterben stopped laughing and rushed toward the door."What's up?"Chuck called after him."A surprise attack by the Garnishee!They approach in force. "And then he was gone."Well, there's something we can do about this, guys," Jerry said."Let's load the cheddite projector onto this wagon and take it up to the walls. "They jumped to it, and just in time too.When they reached the courtyard of the fort, Sally had just run through the gate, which was slammed behind her almost in the teeth of the attacking Garnishee."I saw them just in time," she said breathlessly."I ran every foot of the way back from the plane.What do you think of my outfit?"She was tastefully dressed in neat shorts and blouse of colorful fabric cut from the Pleasantville football uniforms.But she had to stamp her foot in annoyance  how like men!as they did not even answer her but ran quickly away staggering under the weight of a big tank thing.Men!Always thinking of themselves and not even answering a civil question!While the Earthmen set up their projector, the Ormoloo were fighting for their very lives, for this was an attack in force with hundreds of armored vehicles streaking down from the hills.On the parapet nearby a linear magnetic projector was hard at work.The slaving Ormoloo loaded tar ball after tar ball into the breech of the weapon, inserting a fuse just before firing.Iron filings were mixed with the tar, and these particles of iron were clutched inexorably by the powerful magnetic field and flashed through the rings of the barrel, faster and faster, before being hurled out of the muzzle.When these tar balls struck they stuck, then ignited and burned with a fierce flame visible even in the full daylight.Nor was this the only weapon the Ormoloo used.They had a catapult with two large arms in the shape of a Y to which were fastened a rubberlike material that was stretched back by the laboring soldiers.When it was stretched to the utmost, a bomb with sputtering fuse was loaded into the leather seat, and the whole was released with devastating effect.In addition, they had cannon and rifles, not unlike their earthly counterparts, which they used with deadly effect upon the enemy.Who still charged closer, relying on their numbers to crush and capture the fort."Ready," Jerry shouted."Hurry," a nearby gunner called out."For they are at our very gates and we are lost if their reserves arrive. ""Well, that for the reserves," Jerry muttered and pressed the activating switch.Instantly, with a motion too fast for the eye to see, an entire attacking battalion of armored vehicles winked out of existence.Their tracks were still on the ground  ending abruptly  and the cloud of dust raised by their passage still hung in the air.But they were gone!A cheer broke out from the defenders."If you listen closely, you can hear the splashes," Jerry shouted, and they laughed in unison.The rest of the attackers went the way of the first and the battle was won.While victory still enthused them, they loaded the cheddite projector into the Pleasantville Eagle, repaired the hole in the wing, and filled the tanks with fuel from the Ormoloo vehicles which proved to have very much the chemical composition of aviation jet fuel.Soon they were climbing into the sky, following the pointing finger of Steigen Sterben, who went along as their guide."That direction," he said."It will not be necessary for you to go below the clouds, in which case your magnificent air vessel would risk being shot down.I am in touch by mental telepathy with our observers in the front lines, and they inform me of our exact position.I will tell you when you are over the enemy lines  get ready  an immense fort below us that has stopped our advance for two thousand years  now!"The button was pressed."Ahh, no more fort.If you will be ready, forty thousand troops massed for the attack...now!"And so it went.Before the day was out Jerry's thumb was tired from pressing the button on the cheddite projector and Chuck had to relieve him at the controls.By late afternoon they were low on fuel and had to turn back but, meanwhile, they had destroyed most of the opposing army of the enemy, and the war, after ten thousand years, was won for the Ormoloo.There was indeed jubilation and a banquet waiting for them when they landed."I don't think I could take another of those banquets," John whispered to the others when Steigen Sterben was out of earshot inspecting the toilet facilities of the 747."Me too," Jerry agreed."And I'll put in my vote," Chuck added."Particularly, when you get down to it, since we haven't eaten for something like four days now, nor have we had much sleep. ""That's true," Jerry told him."But we've been busy.When we get back, we'll ask Sally, who is waiting in our quarters in the fort, to rustle up something for us. ""What?"John muttered hungrily."There's no food in the plane and only grass for the Ormoloo. ""Don't worry," Jerry said cheerily."She'll think of something.She's a darn clever cook. "
