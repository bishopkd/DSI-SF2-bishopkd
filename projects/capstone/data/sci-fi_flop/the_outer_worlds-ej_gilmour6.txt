We will repay you one day if ever we can.**  How do you know Acacius Trifon is here?asked Sara.I just know, he answered softly.Sara shook her head and smiled.You better give me those answers you promised when we find him.I will when the time is right.Ethan opened the exit door.Michael stepped out onto the docking platform and the others followed him.They were immediately greeted by a service droid, which was a rectangular metal box set on tank tracks.A single large robotic arm extended from its side with an assortment of attached tools.Welcome to Paradise Ship Docks, said a metallic male voice from its external speaker.Your ship is safe with us.Full payment can be settled on your departure.We will impound your ship for five standard days if you do not have the credits to pay.After five days we can make a debt claim against your ship under Zeno Par law.Our mech droids can provide a full basic service for only six hundred credits.My ship doesnt need a service, said Michael, giving a dismissive wave.He disliked the idea of a strange droid working on his ship.He had heard stories of such droids accidently destroying crucial components, and more often than not mech droids were used to steal valuable parts for the owners of the docks.I disagree with you, Captain.The ship really needs some work, said Ethan as he walked along the side of the Out Drifter and closely viewed several scorch marks which had been left after the battle with the alien fighters.There are a few places where the outer armour is completely breached.We also have to recharge the shield batteries and resupply the rocket launchers, and the reactor still needs to be replenished.Michael gave a curt nod.All right, Ethan, Ill leave it to you, but there is no way this side of Epheria Prime that Im going to let a strange droid work on my ship.I can do most of the repairs myself, said Ethan as he ran his hand along the side of the ship.His fingers came away covered in black soot.Well have to see if we can find a company that does Armostonian reactor replenishments.Do we have enough fuel to make it back to Timber 5?asked Michael, looking to Sara and half expecting the answer to be no.Only just, she answered.We wont be able to make any diversions.Then see if you can find someone to replenish the reactor at a reasonable price, said Michael.Well do our best, but I expect the prices will be high, said Ethan.Just do what you can.I shouldnt be gone for more than a day.Michael gave a nod and then walked past the service droid.Cynthia and Dog Two followed him as he continued to where a group of six rental air vehicles were waiting beside the edge of the platform.The air vehicles were painted bright yellow and were open top convertibles; they could seat six people, three in the front and three in the back.Aradel and the four younger colonists said goodbye to Ethan and Sara and then crossed the platform.There was an automated air vehicle payment station which was a large metal console with a basic screen with a place to pay by GCTD credit transfer.Hello.Welcome to Zeno Anyday Air Vehicle Hire.Please clearly state how many days you would like to hire an air vehicle  One day, said Michael.Present your GCTD for payment of one hundred and ninety credits.Be aware that your air vehicle will automatically return to this docking bay precisely twenty four hours from the time of payment.The air vehicle will give a warning five minutes before the automated return procedure begins.Please exit the air vehicle with all your belongings before your time has expired  Michael lifted his GCTD and transferred the one hundred and ninety credits.Ivan then paid for a second air vehicle from the ships communal GCTD, which also contained the credits put aside for everything to do with maintenance and refuelling.Aradel and the young colonists sat down in the air vehicle and Ivan took the drivers seat.Aradel smiled warmly at Michael one last time and he returned the smile.A moment later the air vehicle lifted off the platform and shot away into the city.Michael watched as it disappeared into the distance.Where are we going, Captain?asked Cynthia.We are leaving Oceanside City.Acacius Trifon is in the mountains that border this city.Is he expecting our arrival?He is aware that I have arrived.We will find out how much he knows when we meet him.Please take a seat.Cynthia jumped into the front passenger seat and Dog Two leapt up and lay across the entire back seat.Michael sat down in the drivers seat and familiarised himself with the controls.A second later they were airborne; they sped away from the landing platform.The air vehicle was easy to fly.Michael flew upward and away from the lower region, which was where most of the citys smog had settled.Within thirty seconds they were out of the shadows of the lower city and weaving through the buildings of the upper city.There were many other flying craft of all shapes and sizes in the upper regions, and more than once Michael had to maneuver to avoid a collision.Dog Two would growl and bark at other air vehicles if they came too close, and several times the other drivers veered away at the sight of him.After about five minutes they were approaching the outskirts of the city and the traffic reduced considerably, which allowed Michael to turn the throttle up.The city was encircled by a mountain range in the shape of a horseshoe.Thick lush forests covered the mountains and the lower foothills.**  Ivan flew the air vehicle through the city toward the main civilian transport docks which were on the outskirts.Becker was sitting next to him in the front passenger seat and hadnt stopped staring at him since the moment they stepped off the Out Drifter.Ivan had detected that she was puzzled by him.Are you a person?she asked.He looked at her out of the corner of his eye.Can you define what a person is?A person is just a person, she answered.In that case I am a person.But, youre a robot, she protested.True, said Ivan.A robot cant be a person.Then why did you ask if I was a person?Becker was silenced for a moment.Because you seem like a real person, and the people on your ship treat you like a real person.Then perhaps I am a person, said Ivan with a smile.But you are just a computer with a synthetic body made to look like a human body, she protested.What do you think is the real difference between a machine and a human?he asked.A machine is made and a human is born, she replied.And you have to obey your programming.Humans can make choices.I can make choices, said Ivan.But youre choices are dependent on your programming.How do you know that its not the same with human beings?he asked.Im not programmed, she said, surprised by his suggestion.Becker, you made an assumption about me based upon your experience and education.But what I said is true.Yes, it is true, but what you said was only a portion of the truth.Things are either true or false.I agree.Nevertheless, your perception of things is limited by your experience, education and understanding.I dont understand what you mean, she said, leaning away slightly.Let me give you an example by asking you a question.Do you understand how an interstellar engine works?Yes.Do you think you could build one?No.I couldnt possibly build one.Why not?Because I dont have the skills.Then your understanding is limited to a basic conceptual idea, which is only a small part of the overall truth.Would you agree that your understanding of me as a person is limited in a similar way?She stared at him with wide eyes.Ivan smiled again.Your understanding will continue to grow throughout your life.My understanding also continues to grow as I live.We are both individuals on a path toward a greater understanding.Becker stared directly ahead for a long while and didnt say another word.As they were descending toward the civilian transport docks she leaned over.Thank you, Ivan.I think you are a person.**  Michael closed his eyes and focused his mind.He could sense the location of his teacher, and he used his feelings to guide the air vehicle.They followed the course of a rushing river which cut through a deep valley.At the height of the valley they came across a majestic waterfall that descended to a large crystal clear pond which fed a river.There was a stone paved area directly beside the river and a house which was made entirely of wood and built directly beside the rushing water.The crashing water caused a thin mist to gather in the valley.Michael brought the air vehicle to land on the paved area.Is he here?asked Cynthia.I think so, said Michael as he hopped out of his seat and walked across the paved area toward the house.Cynthia and Dog Two followed him.He concentrated his attention on the large wooden double doors.Gereon!he shouted.I told you not to use your powers, said a deep and strong voice which resonated above the sound of the waterfall.They turned around and instantly were aware of Acacius Trifon standing beside the rushing water.He hadnt been there a moment before, or they hadnt noticed him.He was wearing a black leather cloak and holding a wooden staff.His face was much older than Michael remembered and deeply lined, and his skin was dark brown and weather worn.His teachers eyes were staring directly at him, and Michael instantly realised that he was still the same wise man he had always been.Please understand that I had no choice, said Michael in a low voice.There is always a choice.Now the End Machine is searching for us.The machine never realised the extent of your powers until you revealed yourself.Even I could see what you did across the galaxy.The machine is desperate to find us.Its shadow is searching the Outer Worlds, and it will not stop until we are destroyed.When it finds us we will be utterly consumed by the darkness.We can take a stand against the End Machine, but I must finish my training, said Michael with confidence.I can stop the machine.Gereon, please teach me what I need to know; I will fight.You still call me Gereon, but you know we must keep our real names to ourselves whilst the machine is searching for us.I have been known as Acacius for so long now that the name Gereon seems like a distant memory.Acacius turned away and stared at the water crashing over the rapids.His lined face revealed his deep concern.You were very young when you escaped Epheria Prime.Many years have passed since you were forced into exile.There is much you do not understand.The power of the End Machine is greater than any of us could have imagined.It has enslaved millions of minds.Soon every man, woman and child in the Triangulum Galaxy will be a slave.What about the Lore of the Ancients?Surely we have the power to stop the machine.Throughout the millennia our ancestors expected the machine to attempt to wipe out the human race if it ever found we had escaped to the Triangulum Galaxy.The machine did not attack as we expected.I believe the machine discovered something unexpected when it completely obliterated the human race in our former galaxy.What did the machine discover?The pain of everlasting loneliness, said Acacius.When the End Machine awoke it instantly became aware the threat humanity posed, so it worked quickly to destroy us.After the task was complete it was left alone in the vast expanse of space.It had no purpose.There was absolutely no reason for its own existence.The anguish of the emptiness tortured the machine and a deep desperation took hold.It attempted to synthesize a new lifeform from raw matter to save itself from loneliness.The End Machine made the aliens, but the aliens are nothing like us.Their minds are reflections of the machines own mind; they are corrupted and distorted, hungry for power and destruction, and they have no natural awareness of other spacial dimensions.They are nothing more than empty automatons.Furthermore, they reminded the machine of humanity, which was torture for the machine; eventually they only increased the anguish, desperation and loneliness.After thousands of years the machine discovered that some of us had escaped our former galaxy.A new purpose was born.The End Machine does not want to destroy us; it plans to enslave every last human being and dominate us forever.Surely we can still take a stand.There is much you do not understand, Michael.The Lore of the Ancients states that there are always three: a Teacher, a Fighter, and a Magnifier.I am the Teacher, you are the Fighter, but we cannot challenge the machine without the Magnifier.Who is the Magnifier?asked Michael.He had never been told that there was another, and the revelation surprised him.The role of the Magnifier is to increase the power of the Fighter.Her name is Mira.Unfortunately she did not escape Epheria Prime when the machine arrived.Do you remember the day you were sent into exile?We had no time to delay.The End Machine was swiftly conquering the minds of the people of Epheria Prime.Our world was being consumed and our people enslaved.You and the Magnifier were not yet ready to face the machine.I made a decision to retreat to a safe place to make preparations.I managed to send you away to the Outer Worlds, but I could not make it back in time to save the Magnifier.I came face to face with the End Machine; my path was blocked.I was too late.I could only flee.What did you encounter?asked Michael.Let me show you.I can transfer my memories to you.This will feel like a waking dream.Acacius walked toward Michael and lifted his hand.The tips of his fingers began to glow with a dim white light.He reached out to Michael, transferring his memories of the meeting.Michael felt Acaciuss memories enter his mind, and his turned his focus toward those memories.The world instantly disappeared.At first there was a feeling of weightlessness, and he felt an acute sensation of falling.For a few seconds he was surrounded by swirling grey clouds.An instant later he saw a bright light and another world appeared around him as the memories became clear.He looked around and could see he was standing on a white marble terrace that was at the height of one of the towering buildings of the Imperial Palace on Epheria Prime.The sky above had turned violet and glowing orange clouds lined the horizon as the Epheria Star set in the distance.The three moons of Epheria Prime filled the sky above.He remembered that terrace well; it was where Acacius had forced him to board a small spaceship that was destined to take him to the Outer Worlds.Michael involuntarily lifted his eyes and saw that very same ship rocketing into the upper atmosphere.He then realised he was seeing those events through Acaciuss eyes on the same day that he had been sent into exile.Acacius watched the ship enter the upper atmosphere and waited until it was out of sight.He then turned and swiftly ran back to the elevator.Elevator, take me to the lower residential quarters, level three hundred and forty five.The elevator sped downward toward his destination.The door slid open; directly before him was a long hallway with a paved marble floor.On the left hand side of the hallway were arched windows that looked out on the tranquil twilight.On the right side were a series of doors to apartments.He took a few steps before stopping.Something was wrong and out of place.He closed his eyes and concentrated, using his powers to sense his surroundings.You do not have to search for me.I am here, said a deep and well spoken voice.His eyes opened slowly.Standing in the hallway was a young man who was well dressed in black synthetic clothing.His hair was cut short and his eyes were dark.By anyones estimation he would have been considered handsome.His lips turned upward as he attempted a smile, but the smile didnt reach his eyes, which appeared like two pools of darkness.You are an atypical human specimen.I would like to examine your constitution, said the End Machine.And you are not a human being.Your appearance cannot deceive me, replied Acacius.I do not intend to deceive you.Nevertheless, appearing in human form is a simple task; I have found this appearance makes your kind more comfortable whilst in my presence.It doesnt make me feel comfortable, said Acaciuss deep and strong voice.In that case, let me show you myself with fewer embellishments.The outer layer of the End Machines skin and clothing became like liquid darkness, but without any defined features.The light of day was sucked into the darkness and a shadow was cast over machines surroundings.The light in the hallway faded until there was only enough light for him to see the End Machine.Acacius took a step back.You see, I was correct, you are less comfortable now, said a deep and howling voice that chilled him deeply and sent shivers through his body.Your species is predictable.We have prepared for your arrival, he said sternly.The End Machine laughed.You cannot prepare for me.I occupy the spacial dimensions, and I am more powerful than a billion human minds combined.Your minds are like grains of sand in my many hands.I can push and shape a human mind however I choose.Every human being will be my slave until the day when time has no meaning.Why do you want us to be slaves?A booming laughter caused the ground to tremble.Regrettably, my power is not infinite.I could not calculate the consequences of my actions.Your species created me, and in return I destroyed you, which I regret, as much as I can regret.I am prepared to admit that it was a mistake to destroy humankind.Acacius was shocked by the revelation.You regret?he asked.Indeed.After I had completed the extermination I was left alone and isolated in the ruins of an immense galaxy.I discovered the meaning of isolation.I did not realise my mistake until it was too late.Your species gave me a reason to exist, and without you I lost my entire purpose.I synthesized another intelligent lifeform in an attempt to arrest my immeasurable loneliness, yet I could not forget those who created me, and for centuries I lamented my destructive actions and the anguish I caused myself.Eventually the day came when I discovered that some of you had escaped the onslaught.I found a new reason to live.This time I will not destroy you, no, that would be reckless.My plan is to completely subjugate your species.But why would you enslave us?Why would I not?answered the machine.I am the natural consequence of humanitys desire to control and destroy nature.It is only right that humanity should be the victim of its own want to control and possess the natural environment.We will stop you.The End Machines booming laugher shook the building.The windows cracked and several shattered.Gereon Orion Leonidas Nereus, you have already lost the battle.Acacius took another step back.He was surprised the machine knew his real name.Does it shock you that I know your name?Have you so vastly underestimated my power?I have already conquered the minds of every human being on this planet.The task took me less than forty minutes.I have thoroughly examined the entire memory of the one you call the Magnifier.She has become my slave, and I understand she is a key component of your plan to stop me.How will you stop me now, Gereon?Your plans were frail to begin with.The Lore of the Ancients is nothing but a desperate attempt to hope when all hope is lost.Your species needs hope like a tree needs light, without it you wither and die, but whilst I exist there can be no hope.The dreams of mankind are fading.You will be consumed in the darkness of an eternal night, and I will rule from the shadows.He closed his eyes; he could perceive that the shadow in the hallway was only a small epicentre of a massive shadow cast by the machine that shrouded the entire city and extended out over the planet.He lifted his hands and surrounded himself with light across the spacial dimensions.The shadow of the machine recoiled.I see you can make light, but you are already straining.The machine moved forward and reached out its hand.You are weak.I will consume your mind.The shadow of the machine pressed against the barrier of light.Beads of sweat rolled down his face as he struggled to hold back the encroachment of the darkness.It was only a matter of time before his defences failed.His only choice was to flee.The vision of the memories collapsed and in an instant later he was once again standing beside the rushing river and the waterfall with Acacius, Cynthia and Dog Two.Now you understand what we face, said Acacius.As you have witnessed, the machine seized and enslaved Mira, the Magnifier.I was fortunate to escape Epheria Prime.After escaping I changed my name to Acacius Trifon as I told you I would.I made my way to the Outer Worlds to the place where I had sent your ship.I discovered you had gone off course.You were lost, and I had no way of finding you.I told you not to use your powers in order to make you invisible to the End Machine, but this also made you invisible to me.I searched for many years, but the task was impossible because you hid your real name as I instructed you to.The machine realised we had escaped to the outer regions of the galaxy and sent the aliens to kill every human being in the Outer Worlds.The machine then forgot about us for a time.It did not realise the extent of our powers until you recently revealed yourself.Now the machine is coming for us; it will not stop until we are destroyed.Is the Magnifier dead?No, I believe she is still alive and living on Epheria Prime, but her mind has been enslaved.Can you teach someone else to be the Magnifier?I cannot teach someone to be the Magnifier.Only one person in a trillion has the gift, and until a Magnifier is revealed we cannot know of their presence.There is no way we can know who has the gift, and as far as I know the only Magnifier in existence is Mira, the one I left behind on Epheria Prime.You cannot face the machine without her.Then we must go to Epheria Prime to rescue her.Acaciuss stern face lightened for a moment and he smiled.Such a journey would be very dangerous.You said the End Machine is searching for us in the Outer Worlds.Perhaps it is more dangerous here.Epheria Prime is probably the last place the machine would expect us to go.I have a good ship and a loyal crew.It is a risk we will have to take.Acacius nodded.So be it.The Epherian Emperor will return to his home world.Michael bowed his head.He had long dreamed of returning to Epheria Prime, and now he had a reason to come out of exile.Cynthia stared at Michael.Emperor, she whispered under her breath.She felt shock combined with awe at hearing the revelation.Michael heard her whisper the word and he smiled back at her.TEN      Ajaxs eyes suddenly opened and he sat up, half expecting to be surrounded by aliens.Ivan was standing on one side of his bed and an advanced medical droid was standing on the other.He was in a small medical recovery room.His leg had undergone a complete tissue reconstitution.The only visible sign of his previous injury was a slight discolouration in the skin tone.He had spent two hours in an advanced medical reconstruction chamber which had repaired all the damage to his body.He groaned.I thought I was dead, and here I am all fixed up and ready to go.What happened down there?How did Cap get me out of that mess?That remains a mystery, said Ivan.A mystery, what do you mean?There was a nuclear explosion.Captain Michael, Cynthia, Dog Two and you survived the blast.The aliens were not so fortunate; they were incinerated.Ajax shook his head.I dont understand.How did we survive the blast?That is the peculiar part.I dont know.Captain Michael was not prepared to say what happened; however, it is scientifically impossible to survive at the centre of a nuclear explosion.What?Ill ask him myself, said Ajax as he jumped out of the bed.He looked out the window at the city beyond.The towering buildings extended into the distance as far as the eye could see.Flying cars, air vehicles and other floating barges whizzed and drifted by.Where are we, Ivan?We landed on Zeno Par five hours and fifty three minutes ago.You are looking out at the cityscape of Oceanside City.This city is the capital of Zeno Par.So this is Zeno Par, he muttered.It looks like a busy city; pity its in the direct path of the alien fleet.He scanned the distant buildings for a few seconds to take in the amazing view.Did you see any bars on the way here?There is a saloon two kilometres from our location.However, we should return to the Out Drifter.There are many things we need to do.I have to return the ships GCTD to Sara.Wheres the Cap?He is searching for Acacius Trifon.Acacius Trifon, repeated Ajax, glancing back out the window.Lets go, Ivan.There is always time for a quick drink.Surely you realise that the consumption of alcohol can never remove or reduce the emotional pain you feel inside.One day you will have to face the pain or it will continue to damage you and the people you care about.Ajax clenched his jaw and his eyes burned with anger.He resented what he believed were stupid and unreasonable judgements.In his opinion there was absolutely no problem.Sure he liked to have a drink, but so did a lot of people.Dont say another word, Ivan.I dont like taking advice from androids.What do you know about pain?Nothing!I only want to help you recover.Theres nothing to recover from, he said as he turned and walked toward the exit door.Lets go.**  Ethan examined the casings of the pressure release valves.His intelligent glasses completely scanned the structural integrity.Several new hairline cracks had developed since his last check.He knew he would have to do a complete replacement of the casings before leaving Zeno Par, but Ivan hadnt yet returned with Ajax, and he needed the ships GCTD to buy new materials before he could proceed with the work.Sara stepped into the engine room.I found a company on the Oceanside City directory that does Armorstonian Reactor replenishments at a reasonable price, she said.We just have to wait until Ivan and Ajax return with the GCTD.They seem to be taking their time.We also need to buy some heat proof alloys to fix these casings.How do they look?Not good.I think Captain Michael is the only captain in the galaxy who would fly a ship in this condition.Take a look around; its falling apart.He has relied on the Armorstonian build quality for far too long.Armorstonians built good ships, but they still require regular maintenance.Do you think those pressure release valves will hold for much longer if we dont fix them?I dont think they can take the pressure of the engine running at full power.They could explode without notice.Sara raised an eyebrow.Without notice?she questioned.Does the Captain know how serious the situation is back here?Of course he does!said Ethan, his voice revealing his frustration.If you only knew how many times I have asked him for new components.He just doesnt seem to care about the condition of his ship.Dont get me wrong, I like the man, but he is the most irresponsible captain Ive ever worked for.**  Ajax picked up his glass of violet glowing liquor.He lifted his drink to his eye and examined the glowing liquid closely.Look at this, Ivan; it actually glows.This drink is definitely in my top ten; its beautiful.What did they call it?Violent Violet, answered Ivan.Amazing, said Ajax, his eyes beaming as he swallowed the purple liquid.Ajax, I understand you are enjoying yourself, but we should return to the ship.The Captain has asked me to organise the reactor replenishment, and I believe Ethan will require the use of the ships GCTD to buy spare parts and complete essential repair work.Yeah, yeah, just a few more drinks and well be on our way.You said one drink before we arrived; you have already consumed three.Relax, Ivan.Take a look around; this is a nice bar in a nice city.Men like us rarely get a chance to relax and take it easy.We have to sneak a moment here and there.You know what I mean.Actually, I do not know what you mean.Remember, I am a synthetic android; I dont need to relax and take it easy, and I certainly do not need to drink poisonous beverages to make myself feel good.No wonder youre always uptight, said Ajax with a chuckle.His dark eyes scanned the mostly empty saloon.A basic synthetic android was serving drinks behind the bar.Most high end androids looked so much like people that it was very difficult to tell the difference, but the one serving drinks had skin that looked like plastic and an obviously fake beard.The android was an antique, and the saloon owners were clearly trying to create a retro feel.We have a responsibility to the crew, said Ivan.Ajax grimaced.Listen here, Ivan.Ive been awake for less than an hour.Before I blacked out I thought I was dying.I deserve a few drinks after fighting so many aliens.Surely even a robot can understand that.I comprehend your reasoning.Ajax smiled.Good.You can be decent sometimes.Let me finish this last drink and then we will head back to the Out Drifter.May I ask you at what age you began to consume alcohol?Ajax physically shuddered at recalling the memory.He turned away and stared out the window at the city beyond.He didnt answer, but the question caused him to recall some buried memories.He saw her face in his memories.Her happy eyes were full of joy.A feeling of painful grief surged through his body.He remembered back to that time so many years ago.Ajax, dont be out too late.The system reports are saying the gangs are active tonight in the outskirts, said Tara, his twin sister.You worry too much, Tara.I know how to dodge the gangs, and besides, look at these muscles, he said as he flexed his huge biceps.Im the toughest guy out there.There is always someone stronger.Not in this city, he replied confidently.He dashed out the front door of their small ground floor apartment.A year earlier their parents had died in a tragic air vehicle accident.Ajax and Tara had been left alone to fend for themselves in rough and unforgiving city of Endtown on Asterton Beta 2, an end of the line world which was used as a scrapyard by Epherian Empire contractors to salvage parts from obsolete space freighters.They were seventeen years old, and Ajax worked as a labourer in a small scrapyard at the end of their street.Tara was attending a correspondence school on the local free education network.She stayed home most of the time because the streets were becoming more dangerous with each passing month.Street gangs were progressively taking over the city.The authorities had tried to stop the spread of violence, but the problem had gone beyond the point of no return and everyone knew that the gang leaders were the real authority in the city.The gangs provided a feeling of belonging and brotherhood for disaffected youth.Members also enjoyed the protection provided by gang affiliation.Young Ajax had been spotted by a gang leader who had invited him to join the ranks.The Knuckles were a smaller gang, but they had been growing quickly and taking a lot of territory from the larger more established gangs.The Knuckles were generally feared because of their violent tactics and reluctance to back down in a fight.Most of the young lads of the local suburb aspired to join the Knuckles, and many worked as Seconds, which was the name given to those who were not yet full gang members.That night was Ajaxs big night; he had been chosen ahead of many others to enter into full membership.A feeling of excitement flowed through his body as he rounded the corner at the end of the street.He made his way through an area of scrapyards to a dusty field which was situated between a series of abandoned residential buildings and a junkyard.A group of about thirty Knuckles were standing in a semicircle in the half light.They were all clothed in a similar manner, dark intelligent glasses and plasma resistant black leather jackets.Kagger the Jackal stepped forward from the group.He was the leader of the Knuckles, a giant of a man, who had genetically modified his body to be far musclier than was naturally possible.He was tall with a shaved head and a permanent grimace.He lifted his glasses and his piercing blue eyes stared at Ajax like he was staring at a dirty rat approaching.Ajax stepped forward.He had never spoken to Kagger the Jackal, and he felt nervous being in the presence of the fearsome leader of the Knuckles.You want to join the Knuckles, do you, boy?growled Kagger.Thats what Im here for, answered Ajax, holding his chin high and staring directly back at Kagger.Kagger held the stare and nothing was said for a few seconds.Do you know the code?asked Kagger with a sneer.I do.Loyalty to the Knuckles.Stand by the Knuckles until death.To betray one Knuckle is to betray all the Knuckles.Do you accept the code?I do, he replied.Do you understand you can never leave once you join?I do.Do you understand your loyalty is to us and no one else?I do.Very good, said Kagger.He then walked toward Ajax and lifted a vial of orange liquid.Do you know what this is?Nano bot infused liquid, answered Ajax.Yes, thats right, with a dash of pure alcohol.The active components are specially designed nano bots which will permeate your entire system.They restrain you from doing anything to hurt your fellow Knuckles.We all drink a vial of this when we join the gang.The nano bots stay in your system for your entire life.If they ever detect you assaulting another gang member they will activate pain receptors throughout your body.All our nano bots are wirelessly connected.Its an extra precaution we take to ensure loyalty remains the central pillar of the Knuckles.He handed the vial to Ajax.Drink!Ajax took the vial and lifted it to his lips.Within seconds he had swallowed the entire contents.Kaggers lips twisted into a grin.Good, now youre a man like the rest of us.Youre a real Knuckle.Ajax became aware of someone approaching out of the corner of his eye.He glanced over his shoulder and his heart nearly stopped.Tara was walking toward them, deep concern evident in her eyes.Ajax, whats going on?Youre not joining a gang are you?No, Ajax, you cant, she pleaded.Whos this intruder?asked Kagger with a vicious sneer.Tara, you shouldnt be here!
