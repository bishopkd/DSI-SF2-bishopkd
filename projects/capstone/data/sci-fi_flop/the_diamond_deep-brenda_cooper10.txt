She was speaking for Rubys benefit.It didnt take Ix long to answer.I am copying Naveen on every answer including this one.I did not know that.How long had Aleesi known?It was hard to think through her exhaustion, but Ruby asked Aleesi, Why didnt you tell us?I have evaluated Naveen and decided that he sees you as too valuable to damage.If I had cut off the feed he could have known it.Marcelle spoke up.How are they now?Is anything happening?They are talking to two enforcer bots and another one is on the way.Talking?SueAnne asked.So far, Aleesi said.Onor is afraid.I can read his physiology.But you cant see anything?Lya asked.No.Should I cut off the feed to Naveen?Ix asked.No, Ruby said.But do tell him I know about the feed.Tell him good luck.Tell him I trust him.Thats the only thing I can do.The feed is only one way, Ix said.He cannot talk back to you.Aleesi interrupted.I think theyre in trouble.87     Onor kept trying to notice everything going on around him as the enforcers stole all of their forward momentum through the Brawl.The faces in the crowd, the wary look on Naveens face, the various curiosity, fear, and glee on the faces of onlookers.Aleesi, record this.Were in trouble.I am, she said in his ear.Ruby says stay safe.Ruby?How was Ruby in contact with Aleesi?But there wasnt time to ask.The two enforcer bots had been holding them by sheer force of presence, but now a third floated eerily toward them.Slightly taller and slightly wider, this third faceless cylinder caused the crowd to pull back, muttering.Space opened around them in a place where there was no extra room at all.Onor took that as a bad sign.Dont run, Naveen said.Dont tease the robots.Naveen could joke at a time like this?But then surely he was recording.He was always recording, everything.Even sending everything out.Onor tried to read the intent of the bots.This close, they loomed larger than he expected them to, as wide around as his waist and a head taller than him, featureless.No eyes.It was impossible to tell if they were looking at him or not, impossible to know what they saw or heard.The two that had first cornered them looked the same, but the third had a gold colored band around the top if its head.It spoke.Onor Hall.Naveen Tourning.Haric Lopez.Evie Justine.You are all under arrest.For what?Naveen demanded.Harboring an illegal being.Aleesi, in his ear.They mean me.He waited, unwilling to speak back.Surely anything he said would be wrong.Naveen asked, What illegal being?The enforcer sounded very formal.A hybrid human from the Edge.One who has broken the laws of the Diamond Deep.Dont say anything, Aleesi hissed.There are many copies of me.One can die.Other Aleesis would not be this Aleesi, and would not remember him.That felt like a death to him.Break the earbug.Then he wouldnt be able to talk to her.He risked a single word subvocalization.No.Naveen knew about Aleesi, but he didnt know Onor had access to her right here.Its a counterstrike, Aleesi explained.It didnt work to throw Haric in here so now shes throwing him somewhere worse.And getting you, too.There are signs she is sending people to Ash.I believe that Koren feels threatened.He stood still and tried to feel brave, to think rather than react to the news, or the enforcers.He wanted to flee the way he and Marcelle had fled from the spider bots, but they had been killers which yielded Aleesi.But there wasnt anyplace to run.He had seen how futile that was from the observation window.Evie had not.Her head whipped from enforcer to enforcer and to the crowd, and she quivered.Onor stepped toward her, hoping to get close enough to grab a hand or an arm and make her stand still.Before he could get there, she grabbed Harics hand and raced for the crowd, clearly hoping it would part and make room for them.Haric stumbled behind her.Stop!the enforcer commanded.They slowed, Haric looking back over his shoulder.The crowd remained steadfast and tight, as if helping the enforcer.Stop!it called again, its voice a deep boom, louder than the last command.They stopped.Evie turned on it.We havent done anything.She let go of Harics hand and yelled into the crowd.I bet none of you did anything wrong either.The crowd remained stoic.Curious but not moved to help.Almost cruel.Theres so many more of us than of them.We cant let this happen.Evie looked young and thin and tiny, too insignificant to possibly matter.But like Ruby, she had a force about her, an energy that was far bigger than her frame.Her voice carried throughout the circle, edged with desperation.Help me!A few voices murmured, people shifted.She sounded like Ruby years ago, angry and impassioned.It drove Onors heart into his throat, scared him.Haric stepped between Evie and the enforcer.She stepped out from behind him.He turned his back to the enforcer and grabbed Evies arms, looking down into her face.He looked frightened and desperate and in love.She pulled away from him and turned back to the crowd.Dont let them take us, she pleaded, her back to the enforcer, staring at the crowd.A light blinked red on the top of the robot.A warning?Onor raced toward Haric and Evie.Haric turned and stared at the enforcer, his eyes wide with fear.The robot was so close to them that if it had arms, it might be starting to reach for them.A beam of light emerged from the top center of the machine and struck Haric between the eyes.88     Aleesi announced, Haric has been shot by one of the enforcers.Stunned, Ruby sat up straight on Joels lap.Stunned.You must mean stunned.I cannot see the Brawl, Aleesi replied, sounding stressed.Onor is breathing hard and hes scared.If he were talking I could hear what hes saying, but he isnt.Joel spoke with the calm of a seasoned veteran.Do you have any influence on the situation?She couldnt lose Haric.He was the closest thing to a child she would ever have, even if he was only eight years younger.Maybe the closest thing to a little brother.Regardless, he was hers, and she couldnt stand not knowing what was happening to him.Im trying, Aleesi answered Joel.Are there guards on the door?Why?Marcelle asked.They are using the fact that I exist to attack Naveen, Haric, and Evie.I believe they will come after you, too.You must protect Ix.Anger drove a spike of energy through Ruby.We need to protect you!There are many of me, Aleesi said.I do not know how many of Ix exist.There was only one of Haric.Only one of any of them in this room.Fear joined the anger burning through Ruby.It doesnt matter, Joel said.If we protect one, we protect the other.They live in the same place.He turned to The Jackman.Double the guards on all the doors into Ash.The Jackman gestured to Allen and the two of them nearly ran out of the door.What about Haric?Ruby asked.No one has told me anything.Joel stroked Rubys back and shoulders.If she werent shivering so hard, his hand would be warm and comforting.We need to think, he whispered.I know.I just ...I hate it here.She took in a big gulp of air.Theres no time to get to the Brawl.Ill see if I can get us help.She bent to her slate, but Joel put his hand over hers, stopping her from writing.What?Who are you going to call?Satyana.Shes on our side.I know it.Joel looked directly into her eyes.You trust her?I dont trust anyone here.But shes not on Korens side.SueAnne had been watching everything quite closely from her wheelchair.Do we know what side were on?The one that isnt Koren, and the one that didnt create the Brawl.Ruby stared at Joel.Satyana brought you to me.He pursed his lips.If they were alone he would tell her he needed to keep thinkingshe could see it on his face.She loved that he thought about risks, about leadership, but now wasnt the time.I have to, she told him.We need help.Satyana has ships.When Joel finally nodded, she bent to her slate.Im going to tell her that Im ready to go to my next concert, and she should come pick me up.Joel clutched her closer.You cant leave.Youre not strong enough.Satyana knows that.But I cant exactly tell her we might be attacked by Koren and can you please help?can I?SueAnne asked, Are you leading your friend into danger?Probably.The adrenaline and anger were already fading away, as if her body just couldnt sustain them anymore.Shes tough.Ruby leaned back against Joels shoulder, fading into his embrace and both happy to be there and furious that she wasnt up stalking the room.It felt as if her body was trying to force her to abandon it so it could sleep forever.She hated this illness with so much passion that the hatred gave her a little extra surge of energy.Aleesi?Anything?Onor hasnt said a thing to me for three minutes.Nor has he said anything intelligible to anyone else.Marcelle came over and stood next to Ruby and Joel.Onor is breathing, Aleesi said.Thats something.Ruby took Marcelles hand and looked up at her.Haric will be okay.He has to be okay.Marcelles other hand rested on her stomach.No.No, we dont have to be okay.None of us have to be okay.We arent living inside one of your songs.Ill write a song about this, Ruby declared.It felt like a hollow threat.Marcelles face was white and drawn.If we live, Ill help you sing the damned thing.89     The first few moments after the beam pierced Harics forehead moved so slowly that Onor had time to notice detail after detail, like a series of still photographs snapped with his slate.The soft thud of Harics form falling forward on the hard floor.The arc of Evies body as she bent over the line of Harics thin form and turned her ear toward his back.Two enforcers just in Onors peripheral vision, canted slightly toward Evie and him.Naveen with his mouth open, looking shocked.The crowd moving even further back, feet shuffling and voices whispering.Evie shaking her head and putting it back against Haric, one slender hand on his still shoulder.Naveen murmuring to his audience.Aleesis silence.Onors own body shivering, reacting.His breath.One of the enforcers moving inches closer to them.The first wave of shock passed and his perceptions slowed to a more normal pace.Evies shoulders heaved in anger or fear or despair or some mix of those.Was Haric dead?He needed to see her face to tell; Harics face.He couldnt.The largest enforcer loomed over Evie.Move, it demanded.Evie ignored it, maybe she didnt even hear it.Her hair hid her face, and she said, Haric, over and over.Haric.Haric.Haric.The cadence kept changing, like she could get through to him if she just said it exactly right.Move, the machine demanded again.Onor had been standing, rooted, watching.He should be protecting.He took the five steps necessary to put himself between the machine and Evie.She looked up at him.Hes not breathing.Onor almost told her she had to be lying.But he remembered Colin floating in pieces in the hold, and he remembered Hugh being stunned to death.He knelt, careful to cover as much of Evies body with his own as he could.He lifted her, holding her close to him, getting some of her weight off of Haric.Roll him over.She tugged, and Haric moved like the stunned or the dead, bonelessly.His eyes stared up at the ceiling, and Onor knew he had gone.Another shock rolled through him, anger this time.He stood, legs splayed over Evies and Harics bodies.The enforcer was only a few feet away from him.He screamed at it.You had no right to kill him!A force tugged on his right arm.Naveen.Stop.Let it go.Onor shook his head.Let it go that the thing had just killed Haric?Protect Evie, Naveen almost screamed.The enforcer stood quietly in front of him, looking for all the world as if it were waiting for someone.Naveen backed him up two steps.They stood side by side over Haric and Evie.Onor glanced down at Evie to see tears running down her cheeks.She didnt look like herself, but she also didnt look like Lya had when Hugh died.Angry and disbelieving, but not undone.Evie scrambled up to a crouching position, and Onor held a hand out to her to help her up.She ignored him, and instead launched herself at the enforcer that had shot Haric.Its red light blinked back on.Evie rocketed toward it, a force of girl bent on release.He expected it to shoot her, but instead she collided with it, threw her shoulder into it and her arms as far around it as they would go.It shifted, tilted.Evie kicked, screaming.She bore it down into a deeper tilt by sheer force.They held that way, suspended in space, Evie riding the robot with all of her weight while it bobbed and tried to right itself.The lights on it dimmed.She leapt up and down on the slender robotic body with all of the force she could muster, her face twisted with anger and grief.Onor expected her to fall, but she managed to stay on, to ride it, to almost dance her fury.It crashed onto the floor and split down the middle, a line of electronic guts spilling out between the two halves, wires breaking.Evie crouched and smacked at it with her fists, cursing and crying.The other two enforcers left, moving exactly the way they usually did, quietly and calmly floating through the crowd, leaving the tiny young woman to smash at their fallen comrade.Onor and Naveen stood and looked back and forth between Harics body, Evies flailing fists, and the retreating enforcers.How is Haric?Aleesi asked in his ear.Dead, Onor whispered.That pisses me off.Aleesi sounded so human when she was hurt, so different from Ix.Can you tell Ruby?You were talking to her earlier.Ill tell her in a moment.You should be safe now, but you should leave the Brawl immediately.Satyana is waiting for you near the same door you came in.Shell take you to the Court of the Deeping Rules.90     Ruby opened her eyes, still slumped against Joels shoulder.Shed lost some time.There was no way to tell how much.The same people remained in the room.Marcelle sat quietly beside her, staring into space.SueAnne rested in her chair, chin on her hands, watching Ruby.Lya stood and watched them all, silent.She looked almost sane, as if being in the middle of an emergency had calmed her.Ruby took a deep breath, grinding her teeth against a sharp pain.A knife blade might have felt better than whatever mystery had taken up residence in her stomach.Joel spoke softly but firmly.We must hide Aleesi and Ix.Where?SueAnne asked.He shook his head.Maybe in the bar?Allen surely has places to hide almost anything.We wont be able to talk to her if we do that.We wont know what happened to Haric.Aleesi answered her.Haric is dead.The enforcers have been reassigned to other work.Satyana is on her way to help Onor and Evie, so she will not be able to help you, at least not now.Ruby focused on the first three words.Haric is dead.Joel and Onor and the others had sent him out to do work he wasnt prepared for, and hed been killed.If only she had insisted that he come with her, instead of rebuffing him.She could still see his face.Pleading with her to take him along.He had wanted to protect her.It had been her job to protect him.He was her assistant, her helper.Damn it!Joel pulled her back to their own peril with a tightening of his arms around her waist and a low voiced sentence.We have to get out of here, and we have to hide the AIs.Now.Take my chair, SueAnne said.Why?Ruby asked.Because that way you can go faster and further.The sadness that seemed to drip from SueAnnes voice was almost physical.A tear had gathered in the corner of her right eye, catching on the wrinkles there instead of falling down her face.You can carry the webling in the pouch under my seat where I keep my coat and slate.Ruby started to protest but Joel said, Thank you, before Ruby could get any words out of her mouth.SueAnne stood up and moved slowly to the couch.She must have noticed Ruby glaring at her, since she said, Ill be all right.Im just old.I can walk.And Ruby was sick, maybe sick to death.She couldnt think that way, think about dying, except she couldnt help it.Harics death had bored a hole inside her that sat beside the other deaths that had driven her forward for years.Her friend Nona, who had died after two reds raped her.Hugh, Lyas Hugh, who had died fighting to help Ruby change the ship so that no one else would be raped and killed.Ben, the old red who had always looked out for her and Onor.Joel picked her up and put her down in SueAnnes wheelchair.It was surprisingly comfortable, worn loose and soft by SueAnnes body.A bit too big.Marcelle emptied the pouch under the seat, handing the blanket and slate to SueAnne.What about the others?Ruby asked.Onor and Evie?Theyre safe for the moment.Naveen is with them.Lya had come to stand next to Ruby.The feel of her had changed, as if she had temporarily run out of reasons to accuse Ruby.Her eyes were big in her gaunt face, and she looked more vulnerable than Ruby remembered her looking for a long time.Joel spoke to the AIs.Im unplugging you now.That was all the ceremony he offered them, his face tight and worried as he glanced repeatedly at Ruby.Aleesi would be able to talk to Onor but not to Ruby.The webling would have power for a few days.She felt numb, as if she could slip away into mourning.Haric.Poor, good Haric who had only wanted to matter.Harics death pulled her away from herself.It sent her into a strange soft sadness that was like feeling and not feeling all at once.She hated it.She should be so full of anger that the only choice she had was to be strong, to feel strong.The best she could manage was to grip the arms of the chair hard and sit up as straight as she could.There were still tangles in her hair.What a strange thing to worry about.Maybe people worried about little things when everything else felt big.Joel bent in front of her, holding the webling.His hands slid beneath the fabric of the seat, pushing the big object into the pouch.It barely fit.We need to cover it.Here.Lya stood beside Joel, holding out the white shawl that had been draped across her shoulders.For a moment his tense shoulders suggested that hed refuse to let Lya help even when he needed her, but instead he drew a deep breath and took the shawl and stuffed it around the cylinder.It would provide both covering and cushioning.When he was done, Joel touched Rubys knee and gave her a soft, tender smile.Im ready, she said.She looked over at SueAnne.Thank you.The old woman smiled, and then settled back in the chair she had chosen to sit in and pulled out her slate.It felt wrong to be wheeled out of the room instead of walking out.One of the wheels creaked each time around, giving a beat to her movement.They took an elevator she had passed but never taken, going down the two floors from the morning meeting room to the base floor of Ash.They passed one of the open areas where two mothers watched over four children playing with red balls.None of them looked her way, or noticed that it was Ruby and not SueAnne in the wheelchair.The bar was empty when they got there, unless you counted a single robotic server that told them to sit wherever they wanted.Its never talked to me before, Ruby said.Joel said, Allen usually turns that off.If the robot is talking to us, then Allen is off somewhere else.Maybe he left a note.He wheeled Ruby to a seat and left her to check the board behind the bar.Allen said hes in the big kitchen.Lets go find him.I can stay here, Ruby said.Joel eyed Lya, clearly trying to figure out how to remind Ruby what he thought of Lya without telegraphing it loud enough for Lya to notice.He failed; concern painted his face tight.Its okay, Ruby told him.It will only take you ten minutes.Im safe enough.He truly looked torn.Go on, she said.You need Allen to find a truly hidden place.The cargo bars had been full of clever hidey holes.Surely Allen had built some into this bar.Besides, I really am safe enough.Ive known Lya longer than Ive known you.That decided him.Ill hurry.He was gone almost before he finished saying it.Ruby and Lya each ordered citrus water from the serving robot.Ruby watched it trundle off, trying not to feel Harics death any more than she had to.She took the emergency pin that Satyana had given her and held it.The bot squeaked back across the floor with its tray.Ruby took a tumbler and looked at Lya, struggling for words.At least there are some good things here.We never had this kind of bitter sweet in a drink.Lya took her own sip, and made a slight face.I wish it were slightly sweeter.Her voice dropped.Im sorry about Haric.I liked him.He was so earnest.Yes.I know about death, you know, Lya said.I know how it turns you around and gives you a different focus entirely.Ruby laughed.What do you think drives me?Lya didnt answer with any of the trite phrases shed been spouting off to her followers.She waited Ruby out.The awkward silence left Ruby thinking of Haric standing by her side so often, waiting to help her.I had a friend once.Back when we were still in school and before the sky fell.Her name was Nona.I think Ive mentioned her to you.She trailed off, remembering how she and Nona used to sit side by side in common and make up stories about the people walking by.We were always together.Onor knew her, and Marcelle had met her.If she had lived, there would have been four of us, except maybe if she were still here, I never would have wanted to fight badly enough to change anything.What happened?Her mom needed pillsmaybe now I can look back and see it was an addiction, but then we were young.Anyway, Nona earned stuff the way young girls could then, she sold herself to the reds.Thats why I hate prostitution so much.It was killing herjust doing it.Selling her soul.But I was worried that even worse would happen.I went to stop her, but I was too late.Ruby felt tears at the edges of her eyes, and wiped at them.It wouldnt do for Korens people to come in and find Ruby crying.She hadnt cried about Nona for a long time.Shed thought about her a lot, turned her into a personal icon, her death into a whip she struck herself with over and over.But she hadnt thought about the girl who wanted to succeed in school so bad she woke up an hour before the shift change warning bell.The girl who told jokes that made Ruby giggle so hard she almost fell off a bench once.Ruby couldnt remember the joke any more, but she did remember the explosion of laughter.When it felt like she had some emotional control back, Ruby continued.I found her.She had been stabbed.By reds.To this day, her death reminds me how awful too much power is.Maybe she didnt give them good enough sex that night, maybe she said the wrong thing, maybe they just didnt want to get caught.Now she was angry all over again and tears were spilling down her face.Thats why I did it.Two deep breaths.She need to have more control.I saw that we got free so no one else could die unnoticed that way.Lya knelt beside the chair and put an arm across Rubys back.Im sorry, she said.Ruby lifted her face.Im sorry about Hugh.You never said that before.Im sorry about that, too.And about Haric, and about herself.She was going to die.She could feel it, like an out breath that thinking about Nona had made possible.Only she didnt want to.She wanted to sing, she wanted to change the whole damned station here, and she wanted to hold Marcelles baby.Most of all, she wanted to hold Marcelles baby.As if thinking about her illness made it talk to her, a sharp pain stabbed up from her insides, as if it were reaching from her belly toward her heart.She bent over the pain.Its exquisite sharpness drove away other feelings and shrank her world to her physical reaction.She counted her own heartbeats as the agony eased.Footsteps made her look up.Joel coming in the interior door he had left through.Allen followed.Joel must not have liked what he saw on her face since he rushed to her side.Are you okay?No.She nodded.Of course.Her voice sounded hoarse and just louder than a whisper.Before she could ask if hed found a hiding place, four men in uniform came through the door from the outside hallway.Ruby Martin and Joel North?Joel stood up.Yes?You are required to come with us.You have been accused of violating one of the three primal Deeping Rules and are accused of causing harm to the station.Joel asked.Who are we accused of harming?That will be explained to you.Ruby opened the pin and pushed the button.According to who?Lya asked.Cant you see that Rubys sick?She needs to stay here.The man who had spoken looked down at Ruby.Can you walk?She couldnt.Not very far.But Ix and Aleesi were under her chair, and now they couldnt move them.No.Joel took the decision away from her.She needs to use the chair or shell be too tired.Ill push her.The man was staring at Ruby.So its true?You really are sick?I heard about your fall, but I didnt think it was real.Ruby nodded.She couldnt speak, not and keep her temper and her tears both away.Very well.You can keep the chair.With no more ceremony that that, the leader turned around and started walking for the door.The other three stood and waited.Joel pulled Ruby away from the table.Ill go with you, Lya said.Only these two, one of the uniformed men told her.Lya looked sincerely regretful, almost frightened.Allen glared at the two men, looking a bit helpless.Not a look she was used to seeing on his face; it looked odd on him.Where are you taking us?Ruby asked.To the Court of the Deeping Rules.91     Onor kept looking for any other immediate threats.Naveens lips moved as he spoke to someone through his slate, probably the mysterious Satyana.He looked pale and slightly scared; shaken.Onor couldnt tell if he was affected by the enforcers or the crowd or Harics body or whatever the person on the other side of the line was telling him.Evies fists clenched at her side.She stared at the broken metal body of the enforcer she had just been pummeling with her bare hands.Blood dripped from a cut on the outside of her right fist, leaving a trail of glistening red droplets on the hard floor of the Brawl.At the moment she occupied the middle of an open space, although the crowd was closing in a step at a time.Onor came up behind her and put his arms around her, pulling her in close to him.Im so sorry, he whispered as softly as he could, as if he were trying to calm a child.Im so sorry.But we need to go now.He saved you; dont waste that.He would be so angry if you die.She shook her head as if denying his words.I have to keep you safe, and I have to get us all home safe.She put her hands up between her body and his arms, breaking his hold on her and standing still, staring at Harics body.Come on, he whispered.I dont believe hes dead.Of course you dont.He had known death since his parents died, and almost every year he had lost someone, and then more in times of fighting, a staccato beat to his life.Death didnt change what the living had to do, and they needed to move.We can mourn later, when were safe.You dont think so now, but youll be okay.If we get out of here.All right, she said, standing still and staring at Harics face as if love alone could will him to stand up and breathe.She didnt move until Naveen came up on her other side and took her bleeding hand.Now.To the door.The door was fairly close, maybe five minutes walking away.Naveen gestured to the men who had first caught them and brought them all together.They joined up and created a silent wedge that Onor, Evie and Naveen walked in the center of.Evie stumbled a little, but refused help or hands from either of them, clutching herself tightly with her shoulders pulled in over her.The crowd that had refused to part for Evie and Haric to help them get away from the enforcer parted for these men, stepping aside quickly.In just a few moments, they stood in front of the doors out of the Brawl.Onor glanced at Naveen, who gave him a nod.Ive got it.Sure enough, the doors opened as if an unseen hand pulled them apart.A small brown skinned woman stood on the other side in front of about ten guards wearing the same uniform as the guard who had reluctantly let them in here.Onor, Evie, and Naveen walked through and the doors closed behind them.Onor looked for the guard they had talked to and found him on the far right side of the line.Im sorry, the man mouthed from his place in the line around the woman, who could only be Satyana.Onor appreciated the small touch of humanity.Satyana stood, taking stock of them.She looked small and fierce, and very well dressed in a flight suit that embodied comfort and fashion all at once.Nothing like anyone from Ash.Her voice was strong and quick.Are you okay?Can you run?Yes, Onor said, echoed by Evie, who still seemed to be hugging herself, or maybe hugging her hurt hand.Satyana didnt wait for Naveen to answer, but just turned and took off at a steady jog.They followed, Evie in front, Naveen and Onor behind and next to each other.The uniformed guards followed until they came out again in the same vestibule that Onor and Evie had come in through.Satyana led the four of them up and to the observation window level and along the corridor toward the train station.Onor glanced through the window, but he couldnt see if anyone had come for Harics body yet.From here, he could see the divisions between groups more clearly, especially now that they had been among them.He needed to be sure that no one he loved ever went back there.He missed Marcelle fiercely in that moment, and the unborn baby, and everyone else back in Ash.Instead of crossing into the train station, Satyana led them through two corridors Onor had never seen and into a suiting room next to an airlock.Have you ever been in a pressure suit?Onor asked Evie quietly.Evies eyes grew wide and she stopped shaking.No.She watched Naveen and Satyana slide their suits on and check seals.Then Naveen helped Onor, and Satyana explained the whole process to Evie.Onor finished before Evie, and heard Satyana murmur in a voice that Onor couldnt imagine disobeying.There.Now slide the arms up so you can move your elbows.Next time, wear pants.Dresses are almost impossible in these suits.Indeed, Evies dress bunched oddly, but modestly, against her hips and thighs.Even though the suit looked strange on her, she looked calmer than hed seen her since before they left to hunt Haric down.For that alone, Onor was grateful to Satyana.They dogged helmets and went through the airlock into a small ship that Satyana introduced as Honey.Naveen and Evie ended up in seats that faced backwards, with barely enough room to strap in and tuck their feet around boxes and bags of things.The clutter seemed wrong for Satyana, who looked as neat and perfectly put together as Jali, if somewhat undecorated compared to most people from the space station.He strapped in and let the view of the Diamond Deep entrance him, barely noticing as Satyana held a conversation with the ship with her hands and soft, whispered commands.Living inside of the station, and mostly inside of Ash which had no windows to the outer world, had reminded him of living inside the Fire.Now he was out, sitting in a spaceship on the skin of the station, and he could see stars with his naked eye.He stared.The stars dwarfed his pain and losses, and even his fear of the Court of the Deeping Rules.Only a little, but it was enough that he began to feel like himself and the sharp ache no longer took over all of him.The ship gave a brief lurch and then settled into a steady trajectory.Satyana stripped off her helmet, so the rest of them did the same.The Honey smelled like grease and stale food and sweat.Naveen and Evie twisted in their seats so they could see out the window as well.Im sorry I wasnt faster, Satyana said.I lost it, Naveen told her.I had them, the enforcers.A perfect hack.But Koren must have found out we were there.What did the boy know?Satyana asked.Why him?He heard recorded conversations with some merchants.They identified the people who sold them stolen goods from the Fire.Then I traced that back to Koren.Can you make the case that theyre stolen yet?Satyana asked.I can.I have a copy of the ships AI.Ix.I know what it saw, what it thought.I hope youre right.Satyana said.Onor bit his lip.You still have a copy?You have one with you?Naveen narrowed his eyes.Not physically.But I have all of its recordings, and theyre spread through a series of databases.Tell me about this court, Onor asked.We have no such thing on the Fire.Whoever had the most power made the decisions.Satyana laughed.Then you will not find this so different.Any meeting of the Court of the Deeping Rules is overseen by the Councilor who has power in the area the meeting is about.There is an audience, and so they must dance a careful line, but we stand little chance of winning.Do we speak for ourselves?Onor asked.He didnt like talking in large groups, and he wasnt very good at it.Will Ruby or Joel be there?They are good at talking in front of people.I will do it, Satyana said.Why you?Naveen answered.Because you need someone who understands the intricacies of our world to defend you.Satyana has respect.Onor glanced at Satyana, trying to read the expression on her face.Guarded.He felt unwilling to voice a fear that was beginning to grow inside of him.Perhaps they were merely being used for something bigger.Perhaps no one really cared what happened to them, and they didnt know enough themselves to stay safe.Surely he was just tired and heartsick, and his brain wasnt working right.Evie had watched the conversation in silence, but now she put a hand up, as if waiting to be acknowledged in class.Yes, Evie?Satyana asked.Haric sent me some notes he asked me to keep secret.Whats in them?Evie looked offended.I didnt read them.He told me to save them.Can I see?Satyana asked.Arent you driving?Evie asked.No.The ship flies itself out here.She held out her hand, and looked pleased when Evie dropped her journal into it.Evie had come completely un belted now and she leaned over Satyanas shoulder, touching the slate with her fingers.Here.Satyana leaned back and started reading.Onor dug out his slate and sent a message to Marcelle.Then he subvocalized.Aleesi?Are you there?No answer.He waited, but there was no answer from Marcelle or Aleesi.Marcelle was surely just busy, but Aleesi should answer him.Evie was staring at him, worry tightening her lips.He pointed at the outside of the Honey.Look.Onor told Evie.She did.Stars.The ship turned so that the station was easier to see than the sky.Naveen gave Onor and Evie a running verbal tour while Satyana read Harics notes.Naveen was pointing out a bubble he said held the biggest university of the station when he stopped mid sentence and whispered, Look at that.What?Evie.She was sound asleep, her neck cricked at an angle she would probably regret later, and her mouth open.If Onor listened really carefully, he could hear her snoring quietly.Yeah, well, we havent slept for a long time.And she did just clock an enforcer robot.Satyana laughed and set Evies slate down on a cluttered shelf.Did you learn anything?Naveen asked.Some of this might be useful.Its hard to say without knowing more about the prosecutions strategy.She sighed.The court is near the other end of the station.Weve got a few hours of flying, and I can make it even longer if necessary.They wont start without us.Really?Really.You should nap, too.I cant.I need to learn more about the court.92     The four guards escorted Ruby and Joel to court in a ship so big and thick that no one wore pressure suits.It had a huge rectangular window that cut through the front of it and gave a panoramic view.A froth of habitat bubbles rose in front of them.Thats the court, one guard said.Most of the bubbles connected one to another like soap bubbles.Here and there, tubes provided extra joinings.Clear tubes showed trains or robots or people walking in them, others were closed and painted with symbols on the outside of them.The design might have been created by a group of ten year old boys working hard to be sure an improbable pile of balls and square boxes and tubes didnt all tumble out into space.Joel held her hand, watching the pilots and the guards behind them and the approaching structure and Ruby, his eyes scanning and darting from one worry to another while he barely moved.Bless him.She knew him well enough to measure his fear by the extra warmth and twitchiness of his hand, and by the way his features had gone nearly immobile.The more afraid he was, the harder it became for strangers to read any emotions at all in his face.She leaned against his shoulder.Comb my hair?He looked down at her with a flash of such extreme tenderness she had to blink back a tear.He pulled a comb out of his pocket.He started so gently she had to say, Im not dead yet.He combed harder, but only a little.He finished just before the ship docked smoothly and they exited to a series of hushed commands from the guards.Inside the corridors, guards flanked them in front and behind.Joel pushed her smoothly along neat, well lit corridors lined by a confusing array of windowless doors.Bots scurried along one side in a track, apparently such a commonality here that they had their own side of the corridor while the humans used the other side.The bustle of the court reminded her how weak she had become.She would have pitied herself three months ago, or six.She couldnt allow that now.Not from herself, not from Joel, not from anyone.Ruby sat as straight as she could.The webling made a small hard spot beneath her upper thighs, a physical reminder of one of the things she needed to protect.As it became clear that their destination wasnt just inside the doors, Joel asked questions.Why bring us here in person?The muscular guard in front of Joel answered.Everyone accused of an order two or three crime against the Deeping Rules must answer in person.It has always been that way.Not always, since the Deeping Rules had never been mentioned in their database.Ix had never spoken of them or seemed to be driven by them.They had been accused of causing harm to others.Ruby had been trying to imagine what they meant, but all she could come up with was that Koren had trumped something up or that they were in trouble for her songs about the Brawl.She expected to see Headman Stevenson as her accuser, except it seemed that he would not use anything as public as the court.He himself had implied he could kill her or own her without anything like this.Joel asked, Who will explain what we are accused of?The Judge of the High Council.And who is that?That depends on what you are charged with.The room they entered must be on the top and side of a bubble; the ceiling was a curve of sky, with the long length of the Diamond Deep visible in one direction at the bottom of it, yet another reminder of the size of everything here.The chair rolled over a sharp bump and such a deep pain spiked up Rubys spine that she moaned.Are you all right?a guard asked.Its just the view, she said.Its magnificent.The guard did not look like he believed her, but he didnt ask again.As he led them down a ramp, they lost the view of the station, and the open ceiling gave them only stars and a few ships.They were taken near the front of the room to a long table that looked like it should hold more than the two of them.Behind them, seats rose from floor level up, as if the room were a theater.Another table held four people Ruby had never seen.In front of both tables and high up, a rectangular dais looked down on them.The front of the dais was a screen.At the moment, all it displayed was the three rules: OWN YOURSELF HARM NO ONE ADD TO THE COLLECTIVE Two of the four guards that had led them here stayed and stood on either side of the large table.People filed into the seats behind them, making hushed noises.Eventually the room was both full and quiet except for the shifting of bodies and a periodic whisper.The dais and tables in front of them remained cold and big, and empty.93     Onor and Evie followed Satyana and Naveen through doors twice as tall as they were.A large sign above the doors proclaimed they were entering the Court of the Deeping Rules.Onor wished he had been able to stay awake and ask more questions.Instead he had joined Evie in improbable sleep and awoken from a place of dreams so distant that reality had been like a slap hitting him as Satyana shook him awake.He walked through halls of power.It showed in the unnecessary height of the walls, the coldness of the floor, the lack of decoration in a station where most places blazed with color and movement.The transition from hallways to a courtroom full of people and overlooked by stars felt jarring.It didnt help that when he walked down to the large table in front of the larger and higher dais, he saw Rubys long red hair spilling over the back of SueAnnes wheelchair.In spite of the formality all around them, he knelt by Rubys side and looked closely at her, as if the world had reduced to just Ruby and him.Her face was whiter than he had ever seen it, her cheekbones more prominent.When he looked into her eyes he saw pain and a sadness so deep it nearly made him cry.Are you okay?he whispered.She reached out with one thin arm and pulled his head down beside hers and whispered into the ear that held the earbug, her words breathy but strong.Im dying.He didnt believe it.Why?The same thing that killed the children.My body doesnt have what it takes to live here.Well take you somewhere else.We can go to Lym, to another station.Its too late.We can go to the Edge.She smiled.So I can become a human spider?No.She let go of him.He reached for her arm, held it, felt how thin the muscle had become.So much wasting seemed impossible in the weeks since hed seen her.Maybe he wasnt yet truly awake; maybe it was all a nightmare.He should have made sure a medical came to Ash right away, the first time he learned they existed.He had fought it.The calculus of credits had driven him to suggest the wrong choices.Focus, Ruby said.She looked fierce and later focused.I dont understand this court yet, but its our best hope.He had slept through his chance to learn more about it.Satyana took his arm and pulled him toward a chair.Theyre starting.He resisted her at first, wanting to hold onto Ruby, but Ruby pushed him gently away.Let Satyana set us up the way she wants to.Its time to be ready.After all these years he could read Rubys desires as well as always, and like always they were only partly focused on him.It didnt matter.In spite of his growing love for Marcelle, for his baby, he would trade with Ruby in a moment and die to let her live.He knew how irrational that was, he knew that Ruby was no saint, that she didnt love him the way he had always loved her, but in this moment and this place he would die for her if he could.Satyana guided him to a seat between her and Evie.She must have felt his anger because she leaned over and whispered, Calm down.Speak only when I ask you to.Well be okay.He nodded, all that he could manage.Naveen sat on Satyanas other side.Ruby and her chair were on the other side of Naveen, with Joel on Rubys far side.He looked entirely out of his element and as angry as Onor felt.Onor closed his eyes and tried to turn his focus back to his role as guardian and scout.He was the only trained bodyguard here from Ash.To their left, four people sat a long table like theirs, talking amongst themselves.Behind them, gallery seats that were partly full when he came down toward the table had filled completely and a few people stood along the wall.The room felt tense and full of undercurrent, but also controlled.If he had to choose who was friend and who was enemy from the faces in the seats behind them, he would fail.If he had to guess, he would say many were enemies.The trappings of power were clear in front of him.The starry sky arching above a tall dais, a single empty chair next to it, and beside it another dais, as tall, and yet with room for only one person.One table filled out each side of the front, angling toward them.Onor and Ruby and Joel would be able to see every face sitting in judgment on them.A bell pulled his attention to a woman who appeared behind the chair, waiting for a silence that fell quickly over the full courtroom.The table on the left filled with the Councilors.They sat in order: Futurist, Architect, Biologist, and Economist.Koren was the only one not there.An empty seat remained.Koren wasnt sitting where she clearly belonged.He knew the others by picture and reputation.All of them were old in spite of their looks, all of them had held their positions for generations.They came in orderly and sober and sat as if it were a familiar, formal dance.The other table filled with people Onor didnt know, although Ruby gasped twice and leaned toward Satyana, holding a whispered conversation too low for Onor to hear.Headman Stevenson came in and sat at the small dais.He looked around the room with more interest than the Councilors had, and focused down closely on the tables in front.As his gaze swept across the assembled accused, Onor swore the mans eyes narrowed as he passed over Ruby, and that a small, almost feral smile touched his face for an unguarded moment.Then it was swept back away into a secret place behind his mask of power and position.The woman made a toneless and amplified announcement.Presiding judge of the matter of the Diamond Deep accusation toward the people of Ash is Koren Nomen.Koren!Koren as judge?Her name in that position hit him like a punch to the stomach, made him slightly dizzy.The woman stepped back and Koren stood in her place.Her long white hair hung in a single braid falling down across her left shoulder and she wore a golden gown that matched her golden eyes.She didnt glance around at all, or appear to notice that the room was full.She simply sat, cloaked in power.The whole room gave her power of place and her own demeanor added to it.She knew exactly what she was doing.He had thought they were coming here to prosecute her.Not to be judged by her.His uneasiness grew even bigger, threatening to swamp his ability to control himself.He took a deep breath and glanced nervously up and down the table.Loudspeakers proclaimed, The High Court of the Deeping Rules is now in session.Perhaps they had been well and truly trapped.94     Ruby flinched as Koren came in and sat at the dais.It was hard not to reach toward the cylinder in the pouch under the chair and touch it, as if there were a way to offer reassurance to the silent beings living under her.A full moment of silence drove home how little Ruby knew about what to expect.The announcer went through the Councilors one by one.Ruby had met all of them at parties, even held polite conversation with the Futurist and the Architect.They didnt look down at the tables, or out at the crowd, or acknowledge being introduced in any other way.They simply sat with composed faces and watched Koren.The other table interested her more.Satyana leaned over and whispered, These people self select and theyre different for every trial.Theyre called the Voice of the Deep.They are as important as the Councilors.Who decides if Im guilty?Ruby whispered back.The Councilors and the Voice advise.The judge decides.Ruby watched carefully as the individuals who made up the Voice of the Deep were introduced one by one.Ferrell Yi, the reddish blue skinned woman who ran the Exchanges.Ruby had seen her a few times, but never talked to her except in passing.Ramon Paul, the Head of Defense, a man Ruby had met three times, and had rebuffed advances from twice.Probably not a supporter.Gunnar Ellensson.She was almost willing to bet that Gunnar was a friend.The announcer gave out one more name.Winter Ohman.Joel clutched her arm more tightly when he came out; he meant something to Joel.There was no opportunity to ask right now, of course.Then he turned to look directly at Ruby.She recognized him as the man who had been at breakfast and refused to give his name.Now that everyone was seated, Koren stood and stated, Read the charges.The room became eerily and completely quiet, as if hundreds of people were holding their breath.The woman who had faded into the background came back up and spoke, her words clipped and emotionless.The Court of the Deeping Rules will evaluate whether or not the people of Ash violated the Do No Harm law by bringing an enemy of the Diamond Deep inside our walls.This is a violation of history.As such, the Chief Historian sits in judgment.The specific rule in question in front of the court was born at the end of the Age of Explosive Creation.That rule demands that human consciousness is never to be uploaded into a machine body in whole.Violations of that rule demand death of the creature so created.Anyone providing assistance and succor is subject to imprisonment or banishment.A soft mutter flew through the courtroom behind them, although no one in front of them reacted.The knots in Rubys stomach might be nerves or disease or both.Whatever they were felt twisted and deep and hard inside her.Maybe they were simply the knots of hatred for Koren and her kind, for all of this crazy place called the best place in the Adiamo system, for a world so bored and vicious that they dared to prosecute the People of the Fire for being invaded, and for giving Aleesi mercy.It wasnt justice.They should have charged her with trying to create a revolution.In spite of the chair, Ruby could stand, especially with the table right in front of her to hold onto.She almost stood and protested, but Satyanas absolute calm bled into Ruby like ice and warning.She sat still, waiting.95     Aleesi spoke into Onors ear, her voice soft but not whispery.None of you created me, she said.I need a way to speak to the assembly.Why?he asked her.To save you, she said.Her voice had none of the emotion he was used to.She sounded ...flat.What about Ix?Just give me a voice.Trust me.Onor didnt answer her.It was not his call.The woman beside Koren asked what sounded like a routine interrogation.Does anyone in the courtroom question the right of the Councilors or of the Voice of the Deep to counsel the bench, or of Koren to judge this matter in her role as Chief Historian?Onor was sure someone should at least question Korens role, but Satyana sat silently beside him, her throat and jaws thick with tension.Naveen also looked forced still.If Naveen was going to betray them, they were truly lost and friendless.No one answered the mouthpiece.After what must be the proscribed time with no challenges, she said, The trial may begin.The prosecutor is Loura Pillar and the speaker for the defense is Satyana Adams.The prosecutor may speak first.The woman who must be Loura was a complete stranger to him.Even so, he didnt doubt for a moment that Korens case could be made.Koren surely had a copy of Ix.They probably didnt have Aleesi, not if Ruby and Joel had been able to hide the webling.But Ix would be enough; it had the tapes of the murders in the cargo bay and it had the tapes of them talking to the robot spiders, and probably even of him releasing the brains that held Aleesi from the captured robotic body.He was right.All of those things played out in front of the entire courtroom.Even Ruby singing to Aleesi, courting her, trying to make friends.Most damning of all, Aleesi telling Ruby that she was illegal and Ruby telling her that she couldnt help that, she didnt make the rules.The entire courtroom overhead Rubys exact words, I am good at breaking rules.Aleesi whispered in his ear yet again.Give me voice.It took him a while to manage a full subvocal sentence in a way he could hope no one noticed.Maybe we can get you back to the Edge.I am already there, she said.Now give me a voice.If only he understood more about what was going on.With everything.The Court.Aleesi.Ruby.Damn it.He leaned over and whispered into Satyanas ear.Aleesi wants to talk.Satyanas eyes widened a tiny bit, and under the table, her hand touched his thigh, squeezing it.Telling him something.Yes but not now he decided, although he didnt know her well enough to be sure.It had been a message and not a caress, though; his thigh hurt.Loura Pillar stood after the clips ended.Pale and tall, she had dark hair that hugged her shoulders and shimmered with purple highlights.Her clothes were dark and modest, even down to long sleeves and full legged pants over dark shoes.Black lace gloves covered her hands.So you see, Ruby Martin and the people of Ash knowingly brought a being they knew was illegal into the Diamond Deep, breaking court precedent and putting the entire station at risk.A being that she kept alive even after it proved harmful on Rubys own ship, The Creative Fire.This being is from a class of intelligences outlawed at the Deep long before anyone in this room was alive.She stalked in front of the Councilors table and the other table, back and forth, her voice loud enough that everyone in the room could undoubtedly hear.Onor imagined her face being broadcast throughout the station.Surely, with Ruby here, the proceedings were being watched.This being is not an AI; it is an enslaved human.Slavery is common at the Edge, used by pirates and thieves.Enslaved humans are copied over and over and over, losing fidelity with each copy.Losing sanity.Losing what made them human in the first place.This practice creates beings that are abominations.They are not human, not machine intelligences, not robots.This one is a danger to us.She turned and stared at their table, looking first at Evie and then at Onor and then stepping close to Joel and Ruby.Aleesi continued to demand to speak.Quiet, Onor said, Give Satyana an earbug.He did have one.He had thought briefly about giving it to Ruby but she looked too tired to manage one more thing.No, too utterly exhausted.He fished in his pocket and palmed it.These people showed nothing but contempt for us.They are not the people who left here, they are the great great great grandchildren of those people, and they never learned the lessons of the Age of Explosive Creation.We owe them nothing.The woman was actually sneering and her voice had risen.We gave them and their unschooled and undisciplined people a chance.We let them into our home and that very day, when they swore to obey our rules, they knew they were willfully breaking them.We call for the imprisonment of Ruby Martin and Joel North, for the death of the abomination they brought into our midst, and for penalties upon all of their people.Ruby stood.Ruby stood in spite of how weak she looked.Joel stood beside her, stoic and furious.Ruby spoke loudly enough for her voice to carry.No one in Ash except me knew of that rule.Loura Pillar ignored her.Murmurs and noise came from behind them, and one or two people clapped.Onor forced himself to look behind them to assess the threat.Most of the people sat in their seats, unreadable.A few looked positively feral, like the worst of the reds used to look before they beat someone when he was small and nothing had yet changed on the Fire.Once more he felt surrounded by enemies even though he was sure that many of these people must have come to hear Ruby sing, watched her on their slates, or known about her.Sit down, Koren snapped.Youll have your opportunity to speak.Ruby protested as Joel almost forced her back into the wheelchair.If only they had never come here.Onor bumped Satyanas leg with his and fumbled the earbug into her fist.Loura Pillar sat back down, her face once more a mask.The mouthpiece spoke.The defense may now address the advisors.Satyana stood and walked around the table.As she did so, she brought a hand up to her ear.Onor smiled.Thank you, Aleesi said.At least she could now bother Satyana directly.He wasnt at all sure Aleesi would get her way, or how such a thing might happen, but the problem was no longer his.Beside him, a single tear streaked down Evies face from time to time.He wished there was something to be done with her, some way to put her someplace safe and let her cry her pain out.But they were far from Ash.He whispered to her.Was Aleesi talking to you, too?She told me it would all end up all right.Thats all?Evie nodded.Satyanas words drew his attention.We will call a number of witnesses.Our argument is simple on its face.First, Ruby spoke correctly if out of turn.She made this choice alone.Second, the Deeping Rule that Ruby is accused of breaking has not been broken: there has been no harm done.Our legal system allows for this.Loura interrupted.At a lower level of infraction.Satyana stared at Koren.Eventually, Koren gave the tiniest of nods.Third, Ruby Martin has followed all three of the Deeping Rules.She has taken responsibility for herself and for more than herself, for the collective of the people who came with her.Satyana pointed at Joel.Along with Joel North, they have started to succeed when they themselves were harmed seriously by those who greeted them.Korens only reaction to Satyanas words was a bare and desultory nod, as if to say, Go on, Im bored.Satyana herself had gone quiet, and he was willing to bet she was listening to Aleesi.Perhaps Koren didnt think they had enough to prove her wrong, or maybe she was sure that her position as judge would protect her.They had Satyana and Winter Ohman and Naveen all on their side.Maybe.Hopefully.Winter Ohman had set this up.He glanced at their table from time to time, but he never looked directly at Onor.Afraid to give away that he had met with them?Fourth, the being Aleesi poses no danger to us.Even though something in the hushed tone of the audiences reaction and murmurs at this last proclamation of Satyanas turned up his sense of danger, Onor kept watching in front of him.The Councilors faces remained stoic.The Voice of the Deep showed slightly more reaction: Ferrell Yi turned to the head of Defense, her face touched with surprise and worry.Gunnar Ellensson looked thoughtfully at Ruby, almost as if there was a game they played together and she had just produced an unexpected move.Onor wondered if Gunnar was friend or enemy.Onor was once again reduced to watching as Satyana pulled her first trick out: she called Naveen as a witness.Naveen established that he had, in fact, copied Ix from the Fire.Satyana called on Ix, pulling up a version that Naveen stated was exactly as he had copied it, with no interaction with the people of Ash after the exodus.So before Onor had been given a copy to carry about in his pocket like gold.This Ix verified that Ruby didnt publicly share the knowledge that bringing Aleesi here was illegal, even with Joel.It also verified that Ruby was not entirely truthful: KJ knew what Aleesi had said about the law.It did show that when Onor carried the webling up and away from the spider body, he had not spoken to it.Gunnar and Ferrell Yi both looked at him then, their faces solemn and cold.He did his best to look quiet and confident.It was good to hear Ixs voice, to feel comforted by something so familiar.But the real Ix, the Ix that had been at all of the morning meetings and shared the webling with Aleesi, would be in true trouble.Rubys accusers had not called witnesses; they had played media.Ix could be questioned in this context, and Loura Pillar asked, Ix, were you allowed to repeat or play private conversation for others?Conversation behind the closed doors of peoples own habs?No.And you are designed to do what?Protect The Creative Fire.Including her crew?Yes.So you are unwilling to tell us what Ruby Martin may or may not have shared with Joel North or KJ may or may not have shared with others?I can relay anything they said to each other in public.They did not speak much of Aleesi at all, and never told others that it is an illegal being.Nothing further.Loura sat down again, looking pleased.Satyana acted as though Ixs interview was no setback at all.The ships AI has confirmed that Ruby knew this, as Ruby herself confirmed.The ships AI has not confirmed that anyone else knew, simply that it is possible others knew.This is hardly damning.Of more immediate importanceand here I will put together what I listed as second and fourthof more immediate importance, the rule do no harm remains unbroken.There is no reason to be here at all.There is no record of the being interacting with any of our AIs, our people, our systems, or our robots.There is no trace of the being inside of our system.It is doing no harm.Satyana stood in silence for a moment, facing the dais, hands behind her back and tugging on her long brown braid, giving people time to think about what she had just said before she continued.I have no witnesses to call on the point of whether or not Ruby has done any harm.I would have to call the whole ship to prove no harm was done to anyone, so I ask you to call someone who can claim that Rubys bringing this being on board has done anyone any harm at all.A moment of silence ensued, a moment that Onor felt sure was full of Koren and Loura speaking together in the same way that he and Aleesi could talk to each other.Oddly, Aleesi had been completely silent since he had given the earbug to Satyana.Loura spoke.It is not necessary to a conviction in this case.The rule of no human enslavement is core to our protection of humanity aboard this station.Ruby Martin has violated that rule by allowing a human slave to enter here and even worse, by allowing one from a place that is known to be an enemy of the Diamond Deep, a nest of pirates who have attacked our ships time and time again, a warren of melded humans and machines that have allowed and fostered change until they are unrecognizable.Ruby and Joel whispered together, Rubys voice the louder of the two.She stood again, something Satyana couldnt see since Ruby was behind her.Koren spoke to Satyana.In your role as Councilor, I believe you are doing a poor job of controlling your client.96     So much rage coursed through Ruby that it was easy to stand, to face this woman who had done irreparable damage to her people.Joel had exacted a whispered promise that she would let Satyana choose whether or not she spoke, so she watched Satyana closely, trying to look far calmer than she felt.Enough time passed for the room to quiet before Satyana turned to her and said, Please feel free to speak on your behalf.Some magic of the room made her words come out amplified when they hadnt before, as if this time she was being allowed to talk.Her voice shook.You cannot judge regarding slavery while you have the Brawl.It was described to me as a place of economic misfortune, a necessary deterrent to unsupportable growth, but it is enslavement.I have had Ix look up the numbers, and 95 percent of the people who go to the Brawl die there.One in twenty lives and comes back to create a useful life.One of my friends was killed there this morning.She paused as much to regain strength as for effect.I did not enslave Aleesithe being you are accusing me of harboring.If that is what happened to her, then that happened long before I came here.I simply chose not kill her, to show mercy.She paused for breath.You must look deeply at yourselves and your choices.Loura Pillar interjected, We are not on trial.Ruby took a deep breath and tried to center herself.Everyone is always on trial.Leaders in particular are always on public trial.Entertainers are watched by fans.What we do matters.She stood still, then, her arms shaking, her thighs beginning to shake.She should be in Satyanas place, defending them all, defending Aleesi.She had just lost Haric, and she wasnt going to lose anyone else.She had to wait now, she could tell from the look on Satyanas face, mixed amusement and warning.Satyana was playing for a bigger game than Ruby.She had never hidden that fact.Loura Pillar interjected.May we rebut?Murmuring from the table where the Voice of the Deep sat suggested this was an irregular request.Koren inclined her head to grant it.A low murmur rose from the audience, subsiding slowly.Satyana looked furious, but made no move to stop them from whatever they were going to do.We call Min Carson.Ruby sat back down, her breath exhaling in a long slow bout of pain.Beside her, Joel whispered, Those lying women, so softly that she barely heard him above her own breathing.When she could lift a hand to put on his arm, he was so stiff he might as well have been made of metal.A few moments passed while Min walked stiffly to the dais, a man in uniform following her like a mix between an escort and a guard.She sat down and looked around the room, her face pale.Im sorry Min, Loura said, We were hoping we would not have to call you up here.Surely it will be hard for you to speak against one of your own.Min didnt respond.She wore the white of the whispering women, the same white as the cloak tucked around Ix and Aleesi.It made her look small and plain among so many powerful people, almost like a child.Perhaps too plain; almost pure.Ruby willed Min to look at her, to give Ruby even a tiny chance to make eye contact and convince her that whatever she was about to say could not possibly benefit Ash.The chance didnt come.Ruby struggled to sit as still as possible, her hands clenching and unclenching under the table to provide a channel for her anger.Louras black dress and lacy black gloves looked like quite a contrast as she interrogated Min in her white on white outfit, with the visible red scar on her face.Loura: Ruby was one of you once.In the same social class as you?Yes.A class of workers who earned air and food by doing what they were told to do.Yes.A place perhaps more cruel than the Brawl.I have never been to the Brawl.People are afforded air and food without having to work.Does that sound easier than the outer levels of The Creative Fire?Because there is no work!No opportunity!But it was not up to Ruby to answer.Min took a moment, but she said, Yes.Ruby broke the laws of The Creative Fire and started a revolution to change things.And you followed.We did.Thats how I got the scar on my face.Once you arrived here, why didnt you fix the scar on your face?Because all of our credit goes to the collective.That sounds like slavery to me.What do you think?Did you ever ask?Ruby had no recollection, although she could guess how SueAnne would have answered.Mins voice came out thin and small, amplified enough for everyone to hear the touch of sadness in it.I would have liked to fix my scar.Min had never told her.She had even seemed proud of the scar.And how did Ruby treat you?After the revolution?She didnt.We hardly saw her.She was Joels lover, and derived all of her power from him, and took charge of many things.Ruby stiffened.Min had seen Ruby act on her own, seen Ruby argue with Joel, seen Ruby in a thousand roles.Wasnt that what the whispering women didwitness Ruby?Sometimes she came down to sing, to talk to us, to greet us.But she was never one of us again.Min finally looked at Ruby and Joel.We followed them.We wanted to hold them accountable and to be sure that we all knew what was happening to us in on the Diamond Deep.Joel was cruel to us and kept us out of many places, and Ruby almost never talked to us.We might have been invisible.Satyana glanced at Ruby as if to ask if any of Mins words were true.That depended on how you chose to interpret nuances.But there was no time to have a conversation with Satyana, or with anyone.Beside her, Joel remained stiff.Although she knew his iron control would keep him from doing it, she could feel how he wanted to stand up and rebuff Min.He had always hated the whispering women.He didnt understand them at all.Who is us?Loura said, you keep referring to an us.To more than just you.All of the women who lost people in Rubys war.Ruby hadnt quite put that together.Min had never mentioned a loss.Hughs death drove Lyas decisions, her loss of sanity, her hatreds.She should have made time to understand what drove Min.And you accompanied Ruby on her tours.Yes.What happened on those tours?Did Ruby represent Ashs needs?Min had stopped looking at any of them from the Fire, had fixed her eyes on Loura.Satyana spoke.It is unclear what the prosecution is trying to establish or how it affects their case.I have allowed it, Koren snapped.Min answered.Ruby chased power on her trips.She spent time with Naveen, who sponsored her and who has a significant following.Without him, her concerts would have meant nothing.No one would have come.Ruby froze.And she followed Gunnar Ellensson out of the room at the party he threw for her.She protested her innocence, but I have no way of knowing what she may have done with him.Joel flinched and withdrew his arm from under her hand, leaving her cold.Ruby glanced at his face.He didnt look back, and he was so still he could be stone or metal.Min.Min, why are doing this?We talked about that.KJ was with me!97     As soon as Min accused him, Onor glanced at Gunnar Ellensson.He looked amused, maybe deeply amused.But Onor couldnt read the look.Of course she wanted to sleep with me?Everyone does.Im rich.Or maybe You dont know what you are talking about.Gunnar stood up.His seat was about ten meters away from Koren, close enough for him to overshadow her as he stood, his eyes at a level above hers, although if she stood they would not be.Koren remained calm.Min glared at the shipping magnate, as if he were truly evil and beneath her.Onor had never much liked the whispering women, but he had taken Rubys side instead of Joels, had chosen to believe they wouldnt really hurt anyone.Ruby had once even called them a blessing as they reminded her to pay attention to everyone, and they reminded her how much fighting hurt and how much she didnt want to do it again if she could help it.Gunnar cleared his throat.I will speak to you when it is time for advice, Koren said.I thought the audience might like to know that Ruby Martin refused my advances.Korens dark skin made it hard for Onor to read her emotions, and she was too far away for him to really see what her golden eyes had to say about her.But he could read frustration in her voice, and maybe even the slightest touch of fear.If it was there, she didnt show it.If you speak out of turn again, I will have you removed from the room.Gunnar Ellensson sat down, but he looked quite happy with himself.Are you finished with the interruption?Satyana asked.This has not proven harm.Loura smiled as if she had won a prize.I am completely finished proving that Ruby Martin has a habit of harming her own people.Ruby let out a small cry of pain, and he looked over to see that Joel was holding her close, stroking her cheek while her face had gone white and shiny with sweat.The painthe cryhad been deeper than a simple cut with words.He had seen Ruby manage those over and over.Whatever pain caused that cry was physical, and deep, and true.It dawned on Onor that the reason Satyana was doing this nowallowing it or maybe had even architected itwas that Ruby would be dead soon, and then it would be harder.A dead woman could be represented any way you like.Two sidesor morecould argue about Rubys choices and Rubys intent, and even Rubys actions, forever.Ruby wouldnt be alive to defend her reputation.He actually couldnt imagine how Min managed to hold her head up as she walked away.He did not hit women, but Min had made him want to hit something.Anything.Somewhere in the upper audience, doors opened and Onor heard whispered conversations.He glanced over his shoulder, catching a brief glimpse of the back of Mins head before it was swallowed by a small crowd of people.Koren was the one who sat in judgment, but Satyana had hinted the timing was Satyanas.Simply because she knew Ruby would die soon?Or for some other reason?Onor wanted Marcelle so badly he could smell her, the mixed scents of creche and school and the lightly flavored tea she drank now instead of stim.The tea smelled like flowers.And then the seat next to him was full of her, and she really did smell like he remembered, and he had her in his arms.She shook, and his arms helped the shaking subside.He heard a voice, then another, and looked up to see KJ kneeling beside Joel, Jali standing behind Ruby, hands on her thin and bony shoulders, and Lya standing just a step back.An impossible, welcome sight.Even Lya.Surely she wouldnt be here if it was just to say what Min had just said.Satyana addressed Koren.I have additional witnesses to call.These people were not on the list, Koren stated.They must go and sit in the audience when they are done.Min was not on the list.Min is not sitting at the prosecutions table.I will call them all, one by one.Once more Koren exhibited the bored voice and bored face with a hint of fear on it.Maybe a deeper hint.Maybe there was reason to hope.She said, Very well, but when each is done they must join the audience.While they wait to be called they must be silent.Onor hoped Satyana would call Marcelle last.He wanted her to stay by him as long as possible.He had been happy she was safe in Ash, but now nowhere on the Diamond Deep seemed safe for anyone from the Fire.He watched as KJ testified that he had been with Ruby and Gunnar the whole time, and that nothing sexual had passed between them.He even stated that they talked about how unfair the Brawl was, a comment that made Koren roll her golden eyes.Allen spoke of the fact that he ran the bar, and that Ruby was there from time to time, and that she often met with people from all places in the Fire there.Ruby drew people to the bar when she was there.They came to talk to her from all over.And when she was gone, when Naveen took her on tour, the bar was full of people who came just to watch her.Our people loved her.It was a more emotionally poignant speech than Onor could have imagined Allen making.To his disappointment, Marcelle was next.Before she left she turned to whisper to him.I love you.I love you, he whispered back.Marcelle spoke of Rubys attention to detail, of how she may not have been physically in the outer regions of the Fire much, but that she talked and thought about her old people often.After she was done, Marcelle came back to the table and took Evie with her.Such a Marcelle thing to do, to notice something that had to be done and to simply do it.Now, as far as he could tell, there were only the risks remaining.Lya, who might be sane enough to take their side and might not.Aleesi, who was herself accused and who he still both trusted and didnt trust.98     Satyana started by stunning the courtroom, and Ruby, into silence.I have a message from Aleesi.She left it with me just moments ago.I am to play it for you.There are many copies of me, Aleesis voice said.But there is only one of me here.I am lonely here, and do not need to stay.Since my very presence has endangered a people that I respect, I have removed myself from this place.We are taught thishow to kill ourselves if we are captured.I have done that.I am no longer on your station or on your ship.You can verify this by testing the webling that once held my heart.Ruby can show it to you.It has the colonys copy of Ix, but I am no longer there.I have destroyed my own soul for the sake of Ruby Martin.Ruby took in a deep breath, sharp.She didnt want to believe it, although like Harics death, it was true.She should have noticed somethingher chair turning light underneath her as Aleesi did whatever a machine girl did to stop being.Aleesis voice continued.I was never a spy.I never meant to be a spy.I never meant you harm.I am not what you think.Not a slave.I am one of many free beings, and all of us together are one being.This is the kind of change that your society has oppressed.It had made us stronger at the Edge.This is something that you should think aboutthe joy of change rather than the fear of change.But for now, I have chosen to leave you rather than live surrounded by this fear, and rather than see people I have come to love destroyed by that fear.Silence fell over the room.Ruby felt this new loss as a choking clot of pain in her throat and dug her nails into her knees to maintain control.Satyana apparently felt no reason to add to anything Aleesi had said.Instead, she kept her head bowed for a time, a show of respect.And then stood up straight and looked Lya in the eye.Your turn.Ruby held her breath as Lya walked to the public seat.The last time she had seen her, it had felt like they found common ground for the first time in years, sharing memories of deaths that were now far away.But that was one encounter out of many.As Lya sat down, she turned to look at Ruby, anger painted all over her features.Ruby shrank into her chair, hating it yet again.Hating her body, which needed a break, needed sleep and food and for the pain to stop.This felt like having her whole life on trial, like seeing all of the ways people had seen her over time.Her mistakes were being displayed for her dying soul to contemplate.Satyana asked Lya, Were you Mins leader?Lya shook.Ruby could see it even from this distance.Yes.Why did you start the whispering women?Thats only what Ruby and Joel called us.Lya glared at Joel for just a moment, a damning glance.We set ourselves up to be watchers.Every government needs watchers.The crowd behind them reacted to that, murmurs of quiet assent.What were you watching for?Peace.We wanted peace.We had all lost people we loved, and it had seemed that Ruby threw their lives away.We thought she didnt care.Ruby winced.Satyana said, You are using the past tense.You thought she didnt care.What do you think now?Lyas eyes had gone wide, and she looked around the room.She whispered, the whisper picked up and amplified like Mins voice before her, a susurration that filled the room.She cares.Ruby cares very much.A tear streaked down Lyas face, out of place, and then she turned away, as if there were a threat directed at her.Ruby looked behind her, at the audience.They were on their feet.All of them.They had all stood silently and they all directed their gazes toward Koren.Satyana had clearly been expecting this.Gunnar Ellensson stood as well.Beside him, Winter Ohman also stood.Satyana said, I have a last witness for you.Naveen stood.I have created a tape put together from images that I obtained from Ix, from things people have sent me, from news that a dead boy brought me.I have proof that these people not only did their best to stay within our laws, to find a life here where they could contribute, but that they were in fact stolen from.The audience stamped their feet.And that Koren Nomen herself oversaw the theft, and that she set up the people of Ash to fail, that she set up this trial when it began to look like they might not fail.I can even prove she killed to protect her secret.She is guilty of breaking every one of the Deeping Rules.Koren had finally reacted with something besides boredom.She was on her feet, and she yelled out, This will not happen.Councilors do not stand trial.Satyana had to wait for a long time for the room to grow quiet.When it did, she said, You yourself drew us back to the Age of Explosive Creation.At that time, all of the Councilors were put on trial, and all of them were thrown out.We the people of the Diamond Deep have the right to question you.We have the right to hold you accountable.We have the right to demand that our needs are met by our leaders.Koren looked directly at Ruby.Its all your fault.I should never have allowed you to tour.No, Satyana said, It is all your fault.Ruby was simply a new lens to look at our world through.Others have been working this for a long time, and now you and the rest of the Councilors, and even the Headman, will be questioned.You are simply first.Ruby watched carefully, the shifts around them making her both more and less afraid.She glanced at the Councilors bench to find each of them surrounded by at least two people, barred from standing up and leaving.A womans voice sounded throughout the room.This is highly irregular, please sit  and then it was silenced.No one sat.The audience stamped their feet again.Winter stepped down and moved to the bare center of the room, so that all four tables surrounded him and Koren looked down on him.Her golden eyes were snapping with anger and fear, and full of determination.If were possible for Koren to kill with a look, Winter would be dead.He stood in the middle of the room, and he proclaimedproclaimed was the only word Ruby could think of for the tone of his voiceThe Voice of the Deep are encouraged to advise on a trial.We do so now.We advise that this trial is declared null and void.We can show you all of the evidence that we have.He turned slightly so he could look at Koren.But she knows what it is, and she will not want you to see it.That doesnt matterit is now streaming through every device on the station.Everyone on the Diamond Deep may watch it now.Ruby glanced at Naveen, who wore the wide grin of the undefeated.She felt it then.The success.Her part in it.The fact that it would go on, and on.That the trials ahead would change everything.She grinned and she stood, holding onto the table.Joel stood beside her, helping her stay upright, her strength in this moment of victory.No, it was not entirely her moment, not really much of anything to do with her except that she had been a catalyst.But it was a good moment.She found Lya still seated near Koren, and gestured her over to join her, and Lya stood on her other side so that Joel and Lya together held her up.Joel didnt even complain about the presence of the whispering woman.Part Seven          99     Ruby sat in her own bed, propped up on pillows.Joel sat beside her, close enough for her to feel his biceps and the sharp angle of his left hip.The medical robot rested in the corner across the room from them both.Tell it to leave.Send it to Marcelle and let her find some use for it.Joel glanced at the robot.Leave.It ignored him.See?he said.Call Satyana and tell her to tell it to leave.I will.After Im dead?Soon.He reached a hand up and caressed her cheek and then let the hand fall to her hair, which had become dry and unruly.Something the robot gave her dried her out, and she filled herself over and over with water, letting it energize her tissues and ease her dry mouth.Right now a glass of water rested in her left hand, cold and reassuring, as if it were a moment of life.She stared at the ceiling and enjoyed the rough feel of Joels fingers combing slowly through tangles.What next?What happens now?Were still counting up, he said.Winter is a great help.He actually sounded as if he liked Winter Ohman.She couldnt remember anyone else from the Diamond Deep that Joel had actually liked.The idea that he might have a friend warmed her.It was hard to talk so she listened.Well know what we have soon, and well choose a place to go.But well stay in Ash until we really know what to do.Even all of the credit we have now isnt unlimited.He sounded so serious.He shouldnt be.It would be easier for him if he didnt paint the world so black and white.She sipped some water so that she could talk.Thats not what I meant.What happens to us when we die?I dont know.It used to be that we were shot out into the stars.That still wasnt what she meant, but she could go with it.Can you still do that?Can I go out into the stars?Maybe she could find her own dead out there.Nona.Hugh.Owl Paulie.Haric.Aleesi.Im sure we can arrange that for you.Will you see me off?Will you sing for me?Of course I will.100     As soon as he heard, Onor went home.He found Marcelle in their rooms, tears streaming down her face.She looked up at him.I didnt think she could really die.He hadnt either, not really.It had only been two weeks since their trial.The other trials, the other changes, were still under way.The people of the Fire gathered in the bar every night to watch summaries of the days proceedings, the same way they used to gather to watch Ruby sing.It kept him busy, kept Evie busy.At least Ruby got to hold Nona before she died.Yes.Marcelle came to him for a hug, and they watched the baby, sleeping.At least Nona may not have to die.Sure she will.Not for a very long time.The baby didnt care that they were admiring her perfect fingers and toes.She slept peacefully, as if there was nothing wrong with the world, and there never would be anything wrong with the world.
