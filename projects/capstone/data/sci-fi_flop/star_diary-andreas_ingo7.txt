A feeling of weightlessness occurred while passengers passed through a unit made of folded plastic.This unit was used to compensate for any room anomalies that could occur between the space elevator and the space station.Passengers had to use a ladder.The steps would transport them last leg into the space station where they would have access to artificial gravity, and thus be able to walk as usual.Simones breath was strained.She was carrying a burden.Her time as a psychoanalyst felt like a time in a sleeping chamber.She pushed bravely into the human psyche, but she never saw the phenomena as they appeared in real life.The lowest area of the space station was not unusual: It was ominous corridors through a landscape of cabinets and doors.First aid.There were shiny metallic doors, roaring fans in the ceiling.A floor that was marked by elongated bars.Simone came to a restaurant in the vicinity of the lock.She looked towards the checkpoint, where the other passengers came and showed their identities.She sensed the man there: Christopher, the man shed been in contact with and fantasized about.But now she suffered light tremors and ordered a sandwich.The feeling of the restaurant was somewhat muffled: There were small windows, as openings in floating ships.It was somewhat dimmed.Amber light shone from the light fixtures along the pillars of the hall.Simone watched the staff behind the counter: Hardened men and women who were used to living in space: Individuals whod removed themselves from nature.They were happy but still not entirely comfortable.Theyd compromised between the comfort of earth and the challenge of working in space.One of the men glanced towards Simone and walked up to her.He was dark, long and narrow.His posture was slightly stooped, even though he tried to keep himself upright.His face was troubled.A glimpse of a smile formed on his lips when he saw Simone.He had his hands in his pockets and a special apparatus at his side.There was an aura of a man whod seen something others never seen, perhaps a well read man whod seen the mystery but didnt dare to talk about it.This was Christopher.* * *      They walked along the corridors of the space station.It was half rotten banana peel on the barred floor: Parts of an orange, and an apple.Silence prevailed over the surroundings, a silence that pressed on and created nasty connotations.Youre well aware of confidentiality?Christopher said, as if to point out what hed already said.Its not an official mission; no one is even involved from above.Its very private in every way.Are you ready?Im ready.Simone glanced at the lanky man next to her side.She wasnt quick to judge but in this case it was difficult: Christopher was lanky but not narrow in an unattractive way.It was like hed chosen to refrain from food, in his continual focus on his mission, perhaps to do a better job than what was expected.Its a question of an informant working for the government.Christopher said.An informant?Yes.He has a frightening story to tell and I want you to listen to this story.Find out if hes lying or telling the truth.The details will soon be clear.Simone was shown into a room where cigarette smoke was thick in the air.It was like the ventilation system wasnt enough to suck the smoke out: And in a corner, on top of an air bag, sat the informant.Simone sat down beside the informant and looked him seriously in the eye.It was not a pleasant sight: The eyes were hollow, watery, torn.The informant had probably spent more time in the room than a few days.An unkempt beard was seen, remnants of a shaving that failed.He introduced himself as Harold and wondered how long he would have to be kept in the room.Simone said she didnt know.She would go to the root of the problem and only wanted to hear his story.Its not my story.The man said, I would just submit a list of names to contacts within the U. N.   What list?Havent you heard?Harold said horrified, Who are you?What do you want?I work in psychoanalysis.Simone said, Im here to help you.The man took out a cigarette and lit it.The smoke spread through the air, curled up at the ceiling and was united with the rest of the smoke in the room.Just tell me what you know.Simone said.The man looked at Simone with horror.Then he leaned back in the bag and began to tell.Okay...Harold said, Somethings going on in the solar system!Ive seen them: Plants!They manufacture a new type of spacecraft equipped with laser cannons.I have been on different missions and seen the prototypes!The man stumbled and continued.I wasnt supposed to see this!I normally work with smaller assignments.Keeping track of the various colonies.To check that terrorism are kept down in difficult times.But this...Its bigger than anything Ive seen before.Describe the spaceships.Theyre not like the spaceship were used to!Theyre larger.
