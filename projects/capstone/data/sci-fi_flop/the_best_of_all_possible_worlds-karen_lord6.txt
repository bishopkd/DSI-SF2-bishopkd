Id had enough.I raised my chin and walked up to him, pausing at thirty centimeters, which, for a Sadiri, is well within the personal space boundary.Everyone fell silent; smiles faltered and faded.You tell me, I challenged him through gritted teeth.He bowed his head as if in apology, but that wasnt all.Unfastening the front of his tunic, he shrugged it off his shoulders and draped it carefully around me.Thank you, I told him, teeth ungritted.Lian heaved a huge sigh.Im not fat and I cant sing, but, ladies and gentlemen, can we please go now?La commedia  finita.Zero hour plus one year five months four days He fell asleep that night smiling at the memory of Delarua, adorably horrified at discovering her capacity for seductiveness but refusing to retreat nonetheless.Such thoughts should have led to better dreams, but the recent drama had awakened other, darker memories that would not be denied.The nightmares were lying in wait for him.He was sitting on a ridge looking down at a familiar place, a place where he had once lived: smooth, cool residential domes in pale clusters like bunched fruit on a vine; branching, twining roadways connecting all together; a gray green land under blue sky.It was not where he had lived last, but it was where he had lived longest, and the events that led to his leaving had been his first experience of how suddenly and utterly an ordinary life can shatter.How does it feel now?A small savanna dog sat by his knee, sending the query mind to mind with a clarity that only a dream could provide.It focused sad eyes on him with gentle concern, waiting for an answer.Its empty, he said with reluctance.Theres no one alive there, only ghosts knocking on my soul.Already a sense of dread was growing, warning him that the dream was about to go badly wrong.A corner of sky obliged by turning blacknot the black of storm cloud but a true malignancy boiling out like ink to tint and taint the atmosphere.They are already dead, he declared defiantly.There is no need for this.The dog scrambled up.Id get out of here if I were you, it whined, looking on in terror as the sky was eaten.It skittered back, hesitated, and finally dashed away into the tall grass behind Dllenahkh.Wait!Dllenahkh shouted, standing up in haste.The ridge was crumbling under his feet, but that was ordinary fear.The real nightmare came from the cold starlight shining through the encroaching darkness, the type of starlight that shines only on lifeless moons.Its done, its over, he insisted, telling the dream, telling himself.The untenanted houses and silent roads vanished in permanent dusk.He could not stop looking as the last of them went, even as his feet slipped and his hands grasped uselessly at loose soil and dry grass, trying to stop himself from falling, falling into nothing, falling forever.Wake up, Councillor.Tariks hand on his shoulder was a welcome anchoring.He sat up slowly, fighting the trailing remnants of the dream.What is it, Tarik?Whats wrong?Tarik gestured to Dllenahkhs handheld on the table by his bed.A message from New Sadira just came in.Nasiha thought you should know as soon as possible.He woke up at last on a rush of adrenaline and grabbed his handheld.Do you know what its about?The commander observes official protocol on secrecy to the letter, Tarik said with far too much sincerity in his voice.Dllenahkh said no more, knowing all too well that those rules said nothing about what might be communicated wordlessly by a superior officer to her lower ranking husband.He looked at his handheld instead.When he finished reading and rereading, he looked up, but Tarik had left already.He turned off the handheld and lay down again, but the roil of emotions within him was so strong that he had to speak.So, he said triumphantly to the darkness.Naraldi has come back to Cygnus Beta.THE MASTERS HOUSE Do you think Nasiha will continue with us?I asked the Commissioner.We were standing on the quayside watching supplies being winched aboard our new shuttle, a vessel capable of air and sea travel.Publicity surrounding the mission had been very positive, with more settlements asking to be tested for genetic or cultural Sadiri traits.As a result, our budget had been increased.Id be very surprised if she left now, Qeturah said with a smile.She seems to have some idea that to take time off for pregnancy would set a bad example.Something about not creating the impression that females are fragile and childbearing is unusual.She checks out as perfectly healthy, so she can do as she pleases.Maria was fine for Rafi.Gracie gave her a little more trouble, I began, then shut my mouth.Even Marias ailments might have been due to influence and were therefore not the best of examples.Satisfied with the verdict?Qeturah asked after a short pause.I shrugged.About what was expected.Ioans highly specific abilities and his apparently genuine contrition had landed him a fairly mild sentence of a years rehabilitation to be followed by lifelong monitoring via subcortical implant.And he couldnt see Maria and the children again.Ever.The prosecutor hadnt been able to prove ill intent, but there had been reasonable doubt (hah!), and as a result the courts ruling showed both mercy and caution.Homesteads rented out now, and theyre spending time at my mothers place.Rafis attending a special school.Hes not that impressed with it, but hell adjust.I knew I sounded like I was reeling off a report, but I figured I wasnt saying anything she didnt already know, and it catered to the illusion that I was once more willing to talk to her about my private life.It seemed to work, because Qeturah simply nodded, waited a few seconds, then changed the subject.Nasiha asked me about medical techniques to prolong a womans years of fertility.I raised my eyebrows, absently multitasking as I ticked items off the inventory on my handheld and yelled an order to the longshoremen.Sorry, you were saying?Prolonging fertility?Shes quite young by Sadiri standards; why should she be worrying about that now?Oh, it wasnt for her.It was for you.I nearly dropped my handheld.What?Why in the name of allwhat businessme?What did I ever do to her?Qeturah almost laughed out loud.Relax, Delarua.Its a complimentI think.She was saying that you should be registered on the special list for potential Sadiri brides, and when I pointed out that there was an upper age limit for that, she suggested that extending your fertile years would take care of any objections.I was already dazedly shaking my head at the wrongness of it all.Dont worry.I told her that with the amount of Ntshune heritage you have, youll probably be able to have children for quite a bit longer than the average Cygnian.I estimate you have another twenty five years, maybe even thirty.Qeturah!I hissed, glancing furtively at the nearest longshoreman.Must we discuss my private business out in the open where anyone could hear?What kind of doctor are you?I expected it to be a more than routine assignment.The Kirtahsg Islands were famed for their remoteness and inaccessibility and as such were the genetic and cultural equivalent of a vacuum sealed flask.We always looked forward with interest to Ferguss safety briefings about the flora and fauna and the emergency exit strategy, but this time it was the Commissioners talk that got our attention.Protocol must be strictly observed, she said.Is this one of the highly formal places?Even more formal than the Seelie Court?I asked.She folded her arms in a way I recognized as an attempt at self support before saying something difficult.More than that.I want you all dressed in your most ceremonial garb.Titles must be used at all times.Its a society that relies on external cues to determine a persons rank and how they should be treated.She looked at us individually to make her point.Councillor.First Officer.Commander.Lieutenant.Sergeant.Corporal Lian, Im giving you a rather sudden and substantial temporary promotion to full aide de camp, which inflates both your importance and mine.Councillor, I recommend that you refer to Joral as your first secretary.She scanned us again, as if seeing us with an objective eye.Interplanetary Science Council formal blues.Civil Service formal blacks with white robe.Military Service dress whites.Whatever is appropriate for Sadiri culture, and dont be modest.Wear all medals and special decorations.The gulf between servant and master is wide and deep in this place.I dont want any of you stranded on the wrong side.Our first sight of the main, eponymous island was as forbidding as the Commissioners briefing.There was nothing resembling a beach or a landing strip.High rocks surged straight up out of violent surf, and the entire landscape seemed to consist of inclines of forty five degrees or greater.There was evidence of civilization, however.Inland, terraced gardens girdled the hills like green ribbons bordered by hewn gray rock.The same gray rock rose up as walled cities, which then blended into bare gray mountain, making it difficult to see where man made wall ended and natural cliff began.They say kirtahsg means invincible in some long dead Cygnian language, and it was easy to see how the island had earned its name.We had to land in open ocean, submerge, and then resurface in a huge, hangarlike cave.The welcome, however, was far warmer than the first impression.Our group was taken by hovercar to the Hall of the Master of Kirtahsg, an impressive palace in the central citadel surrounded by extensive gardens with tidily trimmed trees and manicured lawns.I was expecting the minimalist decor naturally preferred by the Sadiri mind, a mind that can be sucked into pondering fractal formulas at the mere sight of a Paisley patterned rug.Not so, neither outdoors nor in.The servants and officials of the Masters household were richly dressed.It was not ostentatiousness; it was a more subtle show of plain though rich fabrics, simple but skillfully made embroideries.Precious metals and gems in a classic, understated design were displayed in the furnishings and ornaments and on the wrists and necks and ears of the nobles and higher ranked servants.The nobles also wore their hair long, tied back with jeweled velvet bands or enameled clasps.Oh, yes, the hair.Let me tell you about the hair.It was too obvious and a little discomfiting.The Master, the officers of his guard, the Masters Heir, and all other persons of rank or standing at the Hall were Sadiri as Sadiri could be.Their hair shone brightly, and their skin had a very slight Zhinuvian like glow.The servants, on the other hand, all had dull, close cut hair and low luminance skin.I understood Qeturahs desire to have us Terran types look as official as possible.The Master was as impressive as the Faerie Queen, but his was an aged and venerable appearance.He did not rise from his seat even though he appeared to be lean and physically fit.He had us seated according to our rank and post and listened courteously as Dllenahkh and Qeturah made their requests.At first I thought everything would go easily, because when his eyes rested on the Sadiri, it was with an air of great gladness and contentment, as if he were seeing something finally come to pass after a long wait.I was wrong.Regretfully, we must decline to participate in this genetic testing, the Master stated baldly.Qeturah was taken aback at this stark refusal, given without excuse.We find genetic testing useful to determine compatibility.We also use it as a guide to assessing the average psionic potential of members of a community.The Master smiled.With respect to psionic abilities, I can immediately inform you that we have none.Practice of the mental disciplines has, alas, died out, and with them all the telepathic skills of our ancestors.As for compatibility with the Sadiriwell, look at us.He waved languidly as if to indicate their entirely Sadiri appearance, but I couldnt help glancing at the short haired Terran servants.Still bemused, Qeturah reached for a glass from a tray offered by a small boy, but her fingers failed to grip it safely and it smashed on the floor.Im so sorry she began.The butler of the Hall interrupted her with a terse command to the boy that sounded to me like see you do not fail again or we will ensure that you do not fail again.It might have been the latter, because the boy went wide eyed with fear and fell to his knees, trying to gather up the pieces of glass.While I was watching this closely, I heard the Master say, Take the boy out and bring another glass of refreshment for the Commissioner.The boy, naturally, looked even more terrified and cut his hand on an edged fragment.Nasiha erupted from her seat, stepping heedlessly over the broken bits and debris with an intimidating crunching noise.She picked up the boy and held his fist firmly to staunch the trickle of blood that was threatening to stain the marble tiles.I will take him out, she informed the Master bluntly.Have this cleaned up, she told the startled butler.Delarua, she continued, our medkit.Hurry.The Master only smiled faintly.I think he was accustomed to something that I was only just learningpregnant Sadiri are not to be trifled with.I raced to Qeturahs rooms for the medkit and returned to the corridor outside the reception room, where Nasiha was speaking soothingly to the boy.We got him cleaned and sealed up in a matter of minutes.He stood gazing in awe at his hand as I packed away the medkit.Run along, now, said Nasiha kindly.He did so, giving us an uncertain smile.Nasiha, I dont mean to be rude, but have you found yourself to be a bitwell I couldnt use the word emotional.A bit more vehement than usual, perhaps.Of course, she snapped.It is a natural consequence of the pregnancy.The maternal, protective urge must increase.Oh, well, as long as its natural, I mumbled dubiously.She looked at me impassively and handed me a small sample vial filled with red fluid.Whats this?I said, thoroughly confused but taking it nonetheless.The boys blood.Likely some skin as well.I think you should test it.I frowned.Im not sure I should.Theres no real medical reason for it, and the Master did bar us from genetic testing.Nasiha nodded.I understand.But answer me this, Delarua.When I held the boys hand, I detected that the concentration of telepathic receptors in his palm was far above the average amount for Terrans.How does he come to be a servant in a household that seems to have taSadiri nobility and a Terran servant class?I blinked at this new information.That does make me curious, I admitted.But dont tell the Commissioner, okay?This is off the record.I went to her quarters early the next day.Terran, yes, but also a bit of Sadiri and quite a lot of Zhinuvian.How did you guess?Nasiha shrugged.When the Master speaks, there is much that he keeps back.The nobles of the Hall and the higher ranking servants have taken similar lessons in evasion.It has been my experience that a rich and well run household is like an iceberg.You see the tip, but you must ask about the invisible ninety percent that holds it up.Tarik, who had been quietly listening for some time, said something disconcerting.I have further information on that ninety percent.I rose before sunrise as usual for my meditation and looked out through our window down at the Citadel.I saw street sweepers and garbage collectors.I was unsure at the time, due to the distance from which I was observing, but given this new information, I believe I can say with certainty that they were Zhinuvian.I think it is time we spoke to the Commissioner, Nasiha decided.Please find a way to leave out my part in this, I begged her.She gave me a look.Fine.I sighed.Why dont I go get Dllenahkh and Joral for you?Joral was nearby in the quarters he shared with Dllenahkh, so I simply directed him to report to Nasiha.I had to go outside to find Dllenahkh.Nasiha had made some concessions to her delicate condition and as a result had declined an invitation from the Heir to go horse riding.Tarik had opted to stay with her and be the good and supportive husband, which left Dllenahkh to bond with the Heir.They were galloping around a small racetrack girdling a paddock.It looked like a lot of fun.The Heir was winning, but not by much, in deference to his guest.Youre a natural, Councillor!I heard him cry merrily.Dllenahkh carefully reined in his mount, which was still excitable after the brief run.We have similar beasts on the Sadiri homesteadings.I have ridden a time or two before.Then he looked around and saw me.Delarua!I made a bow.By your leave, Your Grace.Councillor, your presence is requested up at the Hall.It was partly my fault, I know.As I bowed, I peeked up to look at the Heir.His hair was tied back with a scarlet cord except for two long locks falling almost into his eyes.When I straightened, I even took a glance at Dllenahkh, assessing his hair in comparison.It was windswept from the gallop, pushed to one side of his forehead in an untidy dark brown wave, but even with hair cut more like a servant than a noble, he still managed to look more regal than the Heir.The Heir, however, saw only the glance directed to him and took my caution for flirtation and my curiosity for interest.Youre new, he said, swinging himself down from the saddle with a grin.He walked up to me and set the tip of his small whip under my chin.I barely had time to go wide eyed with shock and outrage before a shadow fell over us.He looked at Dllenahkh with a sly smile.Sorry, Councillor.One of yours?There was a moment of complete silence as Dllenahkh pointedly ignored the question.May I present First Officer Grace Delarua, member of this mission and second in civil rank to the Commissioner, Dllenahkh finally said, his bland tone a warning all unto itself.The Heir raised his eyebrows, blinked, and dismissed me, turning his attention back to Dllenahkh.We should race again before you go.Tomorrow, perhaps?See you at dinner.He strode off, striking his leg idly with his whip.What was that?I said, stunned at such discourtesy.I suspect you are not noble enough to marry nor yet common enough to bed, Dllenahkh mused clinically, following the Heirs departure with narrowed eyes.I gathered from his conversation that in his world women rarely serve any other purpose.Creep, I said succinctly.Look, Im here because Nasiha and the Commissioner want to have a chat with you.Think you can tear yourself away from your new friend?With pleasure, Dllenahkh said, matching my flat tone.It strikes me, Delarua, that this society is far more about appearance than substance where being Sadiri is concerned.Oh, you wise, wise man, I replied, sighing.I escorted Dllenahkh to Qeturahs rooms, where Nasiha and Tarik were waiting.Fergus, who was stationed at the door, seemed to be glowering a touch more than usual, but he gave me a sideways glance and something in his eyes lightened briefly.Like to get your hands on some genetic samples?he said in much the same tone that a Tlaxce City hustler would use to describe rare and reasonably priced merchandise that might or might not have fallen off the back of a freight car.You know I would, I breathed just as quietly.Good, he said, and turned to his colleague.Lian, if the Commissioner needs anything, cover for me.Ill be back soon.Lian looked disapproving but merely went into position beside the door in reproachful silence.Fergus looked me up and down, assessing my appearance.Take off the white robe.The blacks will pass for ordinary wear.What about Joral?I asked, removing the garment and pressing it into Lians hands.Shouldnt he come too?I might need help.He cant come.He looks too much like them, Fergus muttered as he started off.Okay, I said, following his long stride with some difficulty.Whats going on exactly?Lian and I discovered a few things yesterday that we thought should be brought to your attention.He ducked down a small staircase.I was just about to ask him why he hadnt simply spoken to Qeturah when he came to a closed door, knocked, and said something unrecognizable.What language is that?I dont know it, I said.He gave me a somber look.Id be very surprised if you did.The door opened, a few centimeters at first and then wider.Inside was a small group of people seated around a table, a very mixed company indeed.Fergus drew me in while I stared, reading the social language of their attire.There were higher ranked servants and lower order domestics.There were also menials I had not seen before, with rough plain garments, shaven heads, and skin that gleamed in the dimly sunlit room.Fergus broke the oppressive silence.Tell her, and speak quickly.We dont have much time.A tall man with pale eyes and shining skin stood up.I am Elion.These are some of the people who have been told to disappear for the duration of your visit.Let me show you why.He indicated himself.Zhinuvian, youd think, by the look of me, but my father was a noble.But with these eyes theres neither status nor work for me within the Masters household.He moved on to a beautiful woman with dull olive skin, brown eyes, and long, shining locs that fell over her face.Surprisingly, she was wearing the clothes of a higher ranked servant.My half sister.My mother had such hopes!She was the first of our family to rise above the servant class.But none of her children have lived longer than a week.The first had no eyes, the rest had deformed hands and feet, all of them had weak hearts.Now they fear to allow her to bear more children, hence the demotionand the warning.He drew aside her hair so I could see the brand that marred her face from temple to jaw, a broad featureless scar that had neither letter nor symbol and served no other purpose but to make her ugly.She kept her head lowered, blushing ruddy with shame.The next woman at the table was a little darker of skin than Qeturah, but with hair so brightly black that it glowed with an iridescent green, clearly unlike the glossy browns and blue black common to the Sadiri.Zhinuvian and Terran.Youve met her son.You helped him when he cut himself.No matter.Hes been punished since in a place where they dont mind if the blood flows.What I began, then faltered at my rudeness in interrupting.I mean, I think I understand what youre telling me, but what do you expect me to do about it?Our Sadiri colleagues are already aware that they are not being shown all of Kirtahsg.Theyre not easily fooled.And if youre worried about how the boy is being treated, why not simply go to the local authorities?A Zhinuvian looking woman who had not yet been introduced spoke up, worriedly addressing Fergus in that strange tongue.He replied in a reassuring tone.This is Karya, said Elion.She is a new arrival to the household.A Zhinuvian slavebought, not Citadel born.Slavery doesnt exist on Cygnus Beta, I said sharply, not keen on being played for a softhearted fool.Arent you paid wages?Every one of you must be registered on the Revenue and Pensions system.Theres no way the Master could get around that.Elions mouth curved up in a cynical smile.All you have to do is claim the credits appropriately.The cost of our food, our shelter, our clothingsomehow it all balances out perfectly.Impossible.The government looks for that kind of dodge.Oh, there is an excess of credits.But it doesnt come to us.Its paid in installments to our former owners.The Master has ties to a cartel on Zhinu, Fergus said quietly.Theyve been buying from them for generations, and when theres infertility, or birth defects, or rebellion, some selling happens too.You dont have to believe us, said Karya proudly, but take our genetic data.Someone might still be registered as missing.Youll get the genetic profile you want, and well get the chance to be found.People always think genetic analysis can do miracles.There was no global database yet.We were not connected to any galactic database.There was no guarantee that we could find a missing person file with matching DNA.I shook my head at the folly even as I heard myself saying, Yes.The data that came to me was disturbingly thorough.They did not only provide samples of their own DNA.The nobility of the Citadel was well represented as their maidservants, valets, and cleaning staff ransacked their rooms and personal effects for genetic traces.Lian gave me a slightly anxious frown as I accepted the first of the stolen samples, but I replied with silence and Lian acknowledged with a slow, still worried nod.I could not leave Kirtahsg without answers, ethics or no.I left Fergus and Lian to see to the collection of the rest of the samples so I could get started in the lab, but I was still forced to press Joral into service to get the analysis completed within three days.The results were all too clear.Joral was puzzled.I do not understand.Have we not encountered three genetically distinct groups on Kirtahsg: taSadiri, Terran, and Zhinuvian?Looks are deceiving, Joral, Lian muttered dourly.Exactly, I snapped.You could choose a mirror skinned, pale eyed, dull haired servant and youd have the same chance of getting Sadiri characteristics out of the brew as with any of those shiny haired elitists.But we have seen this before.What has made you so angry?Joral queried.Besides the borderline slavery, you mean?said Fergus, his tone caustic.Easy, man.He didnt see what we saw, Lian said, trying to pacify him.We only have Elions word for the wages setup, I cautioned.Lets not fling accusations without a proper inquiry.Fergus gave me a stare.Not you too, he snarled.What do you mean?I asked, frowning.The Commissioner.She told me that were not to interfere, that its not our job.Well, like it or not, shes right!I exclaimed.You planning to be a one man army?You think you can bring down the local government?His face set in a determined mask.The armys already there.All they need is a little leadership and some key bits of intelligence.Oh, no.I laughed hollowly.Thats not going to happen, Sergeant.Not feasible, murmured Lian, though a touch regretfully.He grinned fiercely at Lian, part gallows humor, part warning.That field promotion you got is just for decoration.I still outrank you, so if I say we go Youll say nothing of the sort, I shouted.If it comes to that, I outrank you, and were not doing anything so stupid just because your heads all tied up by a pretty Zhinuvian!Fergus turned on me, and for a moment I honestly thought he was going to hit me.I was enslaved by the Zhinuvians, he said.What?I said, my fury erased in an instant by utter shock.Theyve got the best merchant fleet in the galaxy.Do you really think all their cargoes are legal?This kind of setup?Too familiar.I know Elion spoke the truth.Thats how they work.Ironic, isnt it?Terra gets more protection from the Zhinuvian cartels than the rest of us.Makes you wonder if theres any point to the Caretakers dragging us here.His voice vibrated deep and low with pure hatred.I suppose up to that point I had wanted to disbelieve.The idea that trafficking could take place right under the nose of the Cygnian government, that we were no more immune from oppression than any other planetit shook me.I had been holding on to the possibility that Elion had exaggerated, misunderstood, hallucinated, lied, but now I had to consider it as truth.I saw Lians calmly sympathetic face and realized that this was not newsat least not the bit about Ferguss past.I looked at Joral, and he was visibly appalled, considering not only who was selling the slaves but who was buying.Continue to follow your orders, I mumbled.I have to speak to the Commissioner.Ferguss anger radiated from his glare and from the tension of his stance, scalding me even at a distance.I stumbled, set my shields stronger, and left the shuttle in a daze.Wait!Joral called.I slowed my pace so he could catch up, but I did not stop and I did not look at him.What do I say to the Councillor?he panted.You tell him everything.Everything.I stopped for a moment, hung my head, and admitted, Im sorry we didnt do our research more thoroughly before coming here.Weve been wasting your time.Delarua!It was the first time without chemical influence that he had ever addressed me by name and without title, so I paid attention and looked into his eyes.You cannot blame yourself for this.We want to search out any and every aspect of our culture that has survived.We have learned much, both optimal strategies and pitfalls, concerning the future preservation and development of our society.We are grateful.Truly.Joral was so endearingly earnest that, not for the first time, I had the urge to hug him.I restrained myself and settled for a half smile and a pat on the arm.Then we hastened on our way to brief our superiors.I suspect his conversation might have been a lot more straightforward than mine, though difficult in its own way.Qeturah listened to what I had to say, and then she got that expression on her face, the same one I had given Fergus: the one that was weighing the pros and cons of action and trying to work out not simply what was right but what was possible.She went to the window, looked out for a moment, and then began to pace the room slowly.You know, she said sternly, throwing me a frown over her shoulder, unauthorized acquisition and testing of genetic material is a chargeable offense.I knew it.I had known it when I did it.I said nothing.And besides one mans word, you have no actual proof.The results of the analysis I began, my hands open and pleading.only prove that they have an ugly class system based on phenotype, she cut in, stopping for a moment to face me before resuming her slow, troubled pacing.Some Cygnian societies do.It may not make them desirable, but it doesnt make them criminal.Qeturah, I tried, coaxing slightly, I think this one crosses the line.Unless we can prove human trafficking, the most we can do is submit a report and let Central Government determine in due course whether an inquiry is needed, she said sensibly, correctly, and disappointingly.Qeturah Grace!Look at this place.They dont call it invincible for nothing.She sank back into a chair as if exhausted in both mind and body, all considered paths leading to a dead end.My heart sank.I had been holding back one last card, something that could destroy the ruling class of Kirtahsg.Now I had no choice but to play it.I have proof of something that is criminal, I said softly.She stiffened.Why didnt you say?Oh.Its based on the material you obtained illegally.Well, thatll be a lot of help.Such proof is admissible once the crime is sufficiently severe and the officer who obtained the proof is suitably reprimanded.After all, you werent planning on letting my lapse in procedure slide, were you?Qeturah sat up.I think the look on my face was beginning to worry her.It certainly worried me, because my facial muscles had no memory of that particular expression.It was anger, contempt, and grim resignation of the kind that proclaims Those who are about to die salute thee.Analysis proves that the Master of Kirtahsg is the genitor of over ten percent of the domestics of his household, I said coldly.The Heir, who is yet young, has only managed to contribute two offspring to the general roll of servants.I cannot give you precise numbers.Some of the kinship lines werecomplicated.Qeturah blinked and turned her face away.You would have had to run analyses on individual identified data to get that information, she said quietly.As civil servants and scientists we are only allowed to give aggregated results on genetic data unless there is a specific medical cause.This is a direct violation not only of our mission protocols but of the General Code and the Science Code.Again I chose to say nothing.I was too angry and miserable to speak.Of course, any genitor who refuses to acknowledge and provide for offspring at the appropriate social and economic level is guilty of an indictable offense.And if sexual coercion is also a factor She trailed off, rubbing her temples.I have noticed that the Child Protection Division tends to move with greater speed and efficiency than the Department of Internal Affairs, I said derisively.Since we cant make the accusation of slavery stick, do you think this charge might do?She regarded me sadly, overlooking my misdirected bitterness.It must.Youre ending your career for it.Well, I said.I can live with that.I almost hiccuped over the lie.She continued to gaze at me steadily.I looked back without wavering.After a few seconds of this, she gave up and tossed me a handheld.Ill be needing a full report and confession.I caught it, sat down, pulled out a stylus, and began.Our courteous but cold farewells on the morrow gave no indication of what was to come.In fact, it wasnt until our mission debriefing in a quayside inn back at the mainland port that some members of the team realized the full scope of what had occurred and what was going to be done about it.Even Fergus looked a bit startled when Qeturah said that I was relieved of my appointed post forthwith.Lian, who knew everything, looked angry.Joral seemed confused and started to whisper something to Dllenahkh, who merely nodded and spoke a few words that appeared to satisfy him.The two Science Council officers looked grave, but Nasiha caught my eye and gave me a small nod.I kept my shields up and my expression blank.I must have looked more Sadiri than the Sadiri.Of course, the moment Qeturah dismissed us, I immediately left the inns meeting room and walked out into a dim twilight of sea mist.I was too angry to cry, so I started to run, my boots pounding the flagstones of the quayside.I ran past the end of the harbor, reaching a small bay with moored pleasure craft dimly visible offshore.Flinging stones from the pebbled beach into the water helped relieve my feelings, but then I accidentally struck a boat in the growing darkness and a startled shout made me realize that this was no time to act like a delinquent adolescent.I slunk back to our lodgings at the inn, feeling more surly than ever and hoping to slip in quietly, but that was impossible.Dllenahkh was seated outside in the inclement, unwelcoming murk, a cup and a steaming pot of tea on the table beside him, a similarly steaming cup in his hand, and the light from a lantern above making the scene all golden and dreamy, like a Turner painting.I stared.He glanced at me, then set down his cup to pour tea into the other cup.I sat down before it, picked it up, and sipped in silence for a while.He offered no conversation, merely sat peacefully in the lantern light and let the steam from his tea wreathe around his face as he drank leisurely.Ever wonder if youve done the right thing?I asked him finally.Frequently, he replied.Legalities notwithstanding, to not wonder indicates a dangerous lack of awareness of the nearly infinite array of choices presented by life.More tea?I held out my cup in mute assent.His fingertips brushed mine as he took it from me, and I felt a wave ofsomething.Approval?Affection, perhaps?I looked at him, startled, and he held my gaze for a second before focusing on pouring.I spoke simply to have something to say.Ive just torpedoed my career, and all you can do is offer me more tea?Yes, he replied, handing me back my cup.It appears to be having a calming effect.I smiled in spite of myself.Thank you, Dllenahkh, but yknow, I think thats you, not the tea.A faint smile curved his lips as he looked at me.For a moment, I sawI dont know how to explain it, but I saw just a mannot an offworlder, not a foreigner, nor even a colleague and a friend but just a man, relaxed, smiling, glad to be in my company.I felt an odd, fragmenting sensation of suddenly perceiving something differently and having the whole world change as a result.My smile faltered, my breath caught, and I lowered my eyes briefly before glancing back up again, unsure of what I had seen.He was still gazing at me, his face now inscrutable, but his eyes were not distant.They were curious, as if he too were questioning something he had just glimpsed.Drink, he said softly.Do not let your tea get cold.UNFINISHED BUSINESS Enter, I said dully.Nasiha came into my room.You are late for your meditation practice.I was sitting on my bed in my underwear, surrounded by clothesCivil Service formal blacks, Forestry greens, various bits and pieces that were no longer relevant to my life.I cant find anything to wear, I said.She looked at the heap, then met my eyes.I may have something that will fit you.I too am having difficulties with my wardrobe.Today we will go shopping.I came down to breakfast dressed in my own trousers and undershirt and a Sadiri tunic borrowed from Nasiha.I assembled a plate of food and poured a mug of hot chocolate, but before I had to brace myself to face the table where Qeturah, Fergus, and Lian were seated, Dllenahkh murmured at my shoulder, It is a warm, bright morning.We should sit outside.I followed him, ducking my face into my mug for a sip as we passed my former colleagues.Outside was glorious, already starting to be scorching hot but with a fresh wind off the sea that eased the humidity.We took a table next to Nasiha and Tarik and were soon joined by Joral.I ate and drank, absently aware of the conversation in Sadiri but not really paying attention to what was being said.Are you Sadiri?Really Sadiri?The slightly hushed query came from a little boy about seven years old standing on the pavement in front of us.He had straight dark brown hair that spiked up messily, and the tips gleamed in the morning sun.Ive seen you on the holos.They all stopped talking and focused on the boy, their faces softening to near smiles.Yes, said Dllenahkh, leaning toward him slightly.We are really Sadiri.Are you Sadiri too?The boy grinned and shook his head vigorously, clearly pleased to have been asked.He looked ready to say more, but a girl walking about ten meters farther ahead shouted back at him, her expression that of an exasperated older sister.Hurry up or well be late!The boy dipped a quick bow, more of a nod, which the Sadiri gravely returned, then ran off to join the girl.Dllenahkhs gaze was reminiscent, perhaps even wistful, as he watched him go.Do you have any children, Dllenahkh?I asked curiously.The moment the words were out, I froze in openmouthed horror, too appalled at myself to even begin an apology.Although it was true that he might have grown children off planet, it was still an impossible question to ask any of the Sadiri, with so many families in the past tense.His expression was mild.There is no need to be distressed, Delarua.I never had any children.The opportunity did not arise.There was definitely a slight ruefulness in his voice.Nasiha must have caught it too, for she said firmly, You are still in your prime, Councillor.You should make it a priority after the end of the mission.Dllenahkh gave her a look that reminded me partly of Lanuris bemused irritation at being handled and partly of my own response to Jorals comment that I was too old.I smirked, recalling Qeturahs revelation that Nasiha had been taking an interest in my reproductive capabilities.Sadiri pregnancy hormones must be fierce.Thank you for your advice, Commander, but you must remember that I have recently been involved in helping to mitigate the consequences of overhasty attempts to pair bond by the young Sadiri of the settlement.To do something similar would set a very poor example.I would rather see many children in one stable Sadiri household than several ill chosen unions producing one child apiece.To that end I congratulate you for your start Here he graciously inclined his head.and wish you many more offspring in the future.It was smoothly done and all the more so for being sincere.Nasiha lookedtheres no other way to describe itmisty.Tariks face held the admiring expression of a man who is taking detailed mental notes for future reference.I hid a smile, wondering to myself how Dllenahkh had learned to stroke the female ego so well.Of course, Nasiha in a good mood meant she was in fine form when it came to shopping.She immediately discovered the ports best bazaar, uploaded a map of the layout to her handheld, and began to list aloud her goals for the expedition.I rubbed my head and tried to find the right words.Ah, Nasiha, I cant exactly splurge.I have only one months severance pay, and I shouldnt touch my savings until I get another joband an apartment too, seeing as how mines sublet for a few more months.Do not concern yourself.I have in mind only a few simple garments such as would be suitable for both professional and everyday wear.I surrendered and let Nasiha go into mother mode.She draped me in a long off white wrap that trailed over the shoulder and picked out a weeks worth of undershirts in basic colors.She matched two split skirts, one long skirt, and two pairs of trousers with Sadiri style tunics and selected two long dresses, either of which could pass at formal affairs with the right accessories.After all, she said without a blink, the dress you were given at the opera house event may not be appropriate for all venues.I was changing in and out of several outfits, all the while frantically calculating credits in my head, but by the time I approached the vendor, he shrugged and said, The ladys already put it on her bill.I went over to where Nasiha was frowning disdainfully at a large, shapeless dress with a lace up front.Nasiha!You cant pay for all this!Her expression became artfully puzzled.It is more efficient to charge all the items to one account, especially since I have been granted a maternity allowance specifically for the purpose of obtaining new clothing.No doubt we can settle the matter between ourselves at a later date.I understand it is a Cygnian tradition to buy educational gifts for ones godchildren?I was stymied, and it showed in my face, because her eyes got that very Sadiri look of smug satisfaction as she said, Now.Accessories.By this time I was starting to feel as if she were in truth using me as practice for any daughter she might have.She found a clasp for my wrap, which was sensible; selected two belts, which was practical; and then she was musing over decorative hair combs, which was frankly unnecessary.Look at me, Nasiha!My hair is this short!I expostulated, showing her my finger and thumb one centimeter apart.She looked me over.Yes.I think you should let it grow longer.She bought the combs.I realized she couldnt be stopped, so I tried diversion instead, pointing out wraps and tunics and dresses for her own wardrobe.While she was in a changing room, I slipped away and bought something quickly, putting it aside till the right moment.Still, I tried reason.You say we can settle this at a later date, but I dont know when next I will see you.Wont you be returning to New Sadira after this mission?She looked into the distance, her gaze reflective.I do not know.I didnt know what to say to that.She glanced at me, then returned to looking over the fabric of the dress she was considering.The Councillor has invited us to stay on Cygnus Beta.He believes that Tarik and I would help to promote the right image of Sadiri family life.Well, you would, I said sincerely.They really do need more women there, and I dont just mean prospective brides.Women who can be sisters, aunts, grandmothers.Theyre half a people as they are.You and the Councillor are much of the same mind.He has asked for female elders to come to the Cygnus Beta homesteadings.Good for him.Very good.I smiled with deep satisfaction.It was nice to know that Dllenahkh hadnt pinned all his hopes on the bride search mission.She chose a dress, put it into my arms with the others I was holding for her, and started to examine another garment.You have a particular regard for the Councillor.I laughed at her casual manner.Oh, no you dont.Whatever you may have thought, whatever speculations you and Tarik may have indulged in, we dont have that kind of relationship.Again that quick glance.But you could.You are already quite attached to each other, in more ways than one.I felt a twitch of warning and moved my tongue away from my teeth just in case she came too close to matters I couldnt discuss.You heard what he told you, I hedged.He has to set a good example to the younger Sadiri.He cant marry just anybodyand certainly not a disgraced ex civil servant.I only mention it becausewho knows when next you will see each other?I stood still, half hidden by the clothing piled up in my arms and glad for it.That hurt.That actually hurt.Id accepted that my career was over and Id have to leave the mission to find other work, but I hadnt paid attention to the fact that Id never work with Dllenahkh again.Delarua?Ill miss him, I admitted, my words somewhat muffled.But thats no reason for a shotgun wedding.Nasiha, Im surprised at you.Are you I couldnt say hormonal.Is this because youre I couldnt say pregnant either.Why exactly are you bringing this up?She took the pile of clothes from me and looked at me as if I were stupid.It is obvious that he regards you highly as well.I was under the impression that Cygnians are accustomed to arranged marriages.I followed her to the vendor.Within reason, Nasiha, within reason.Is he not physically pleasing to you, perhaps?I pictured myself clapping my hands to my ears and humming loudly, then banished the image and tried to act like an adult.I dont find the Councillor objectionable in any form or fashion, Nasiha, but really.Now, if you were to find some other waylike maybe I could work for him on the homesteadings as an independent consultant or something.That would be fantastic.It was the perfect red herring.She dumped the clothes down for scanning and turned to me with sudden, swift energy.You would like that, wouldnt you?Of course!I exclaimed.That way everyone benefits, no hasty decisions are made, and we pretty much continue on as before.Her eyes narrowed slightly as she considered me.I believe you, not least because you have managed to discuss the subject of marriage without once resorting to a fight or flight defense.Well, I can thank you for that, I said heartily.Oh, and by the way I fumbled in my pocket and brought out what I had purchased for her on the sly: a beautifully wrought cat clasp for her wrap.I thought this might be an appropriate I shook my head and tried again.Its practical, but its also a reminderOh, screw it.Im not SadiriI dont have to deliver a formal speech just to say I like you.Here.With those eloquent words, I pinned it to her wrap.She touched it gently with her fingertips.Thank you, she said quietly.I will treasure it.Getting new clothes was cathartic.I gathered up all the gear I had been assigned, put it into my field backpack, and brought it to my meeting with Qeturah the next day.When she saw it, she looked startled, then hurt.I really didnt see why.She rallied, however, and soon we were deep in discussion about how and when to transfer my mission files and reports to Lian, poor Lian, who was going to have a time and a half fitting in all the work I had been doing.
