  The sound of an explosion rang out.Michael was thrown against the wall and crashed heavily to the floor.The ship shook violently as he staggered to his feet.The lights were flickering in the corridor.He made his way toward the front of the ship, trying to keep his balance as he progressed.What in the galaxy is going on?he asked, entering the control room.There is an automatic plasma cannon, shouted Sara.Why didnt the scanners pick it up?he asked.Your scanners are twenty five years old!she growled as the ship lurched to the left to avoid another blast.Michael stumbled from the sudden adjustment in the artificial gravity.He looked out through the viewing panel.An enormous space station occupied most of the visual field and dwarfed his small cruiser.A heavy duty plasma cannon had been mounted to the outer hull of the station and was unleashing in their direction.Several more bright flashes sped by.Sara brought the ship into an evasive maneuver.She focused her full attention on avoiding the incoming attacks.Michael took the co pilot seat as she angled the ship toward the opposite side of the station and out of range of the plasma cannon.We are clear, she said, releasing a sigh.Whats our status?Did we sustain any damage?he asked.She checked the control console and the system indicators.The ship is fine, Captain.The electronic shield absorbed the majority of the blast, but the outer armour may be a little scorched.Michael nodded and lifted his eyes.He stared through the viewing panel at the huge space station.The station was abandoned in a distant corner of the Triangulum Galaxy.It was floating in the loneliness of space near a giant star called Elgar Domus.A few solar powered lights on the outer hull were still operational, but scans were showing minimal electrical activity inside.Whats the name of this station?asked Michael.The identity signal is dead, but the outer panels are reading: EP712674.Its Epherian; just as I suspected.His eyes lit up and a smile crossed his face.Check for alien activity.Saras eyes narrowed.I already checked, Captain.The scans have detected some minor droid activity inside, but no humans, bracers or aliens.They could be service droids, but I think its very likely that the previous occupants left some security droids behind.Life support and artificial gravity systems are still operational throughout the space station.Sara was a capable pilot.She was physically fit with shoulder length blonde hair and sharp blue eyes.She had once been a fighter pilot in the fleet owned by the House of Gazarian.Gazar Prime, which was Saras home world, had been in the direct path of the alien expansion.The Gazarians fought a tough battle, but like many other worlds they had fallen beneath the mammoth power of the alien fleet.Sara had witnessed the destruction of her planet and the end of her ancient civilisation.She had been working on the Out Drifter for nearly eighteen months, and Michael knew he was lucky to have such a talented pilot on his crew.Droids, he muttered.He lifted his wrist com.Ajax, there could be some unfriendly droids waiting for us.Yo, Cap, dont you worry.We wont let a few robots spoil our day replied Ajaxs deep voice over the wrist com.Remember what happened to Clives team when we came up against those security droids on Marshall 86.Yeah, I know; lets not forget we have the right gear this time  Make sure you pack the electromagnetic pulse gun.I dont want to lose anyone on this mission.Michael lowered his wrist com and returned his attention to the space station.This must be one of the last Epherian stations in the Outer Worlds.I wonder why they didnt tow it back to the Epherian Empire.Epherians can afford to leave one or two stations behind, said Sara.I dont think so; they wouldnt abandon a station without a good reason.I know how the Epherians think; when I was young I was a citizen of the Epherian Empire.His voice revealed a hint of nostalgia.I heard you were kicked out, she said flatly.Youre still dreaming about the Epherian Empire.You know the Epherians dont let anyone cross their borders.Their frontier sentry cannons fire at every approaching ship.They dont care about the Outer Worlds, and they certainly dont care about stopping the aliens.Theyre a cruel empire ruled by a ruthless emperor.You should forget about ever wanting to go back.Michael cast his eyes downward.I have good memories of living in the Epherian Empire.I cant say the same for the Outer Worlds.I dont want to offend you, Captain, but the Epherians betrayed us.Her face hardened.When the alien invasion began they were the first to leave.They left us for dead.Many people in the Outer Worlds felt the same way as Sara about the Epherians.The Epherian Empire evacuated their citizens and armed forces directly after the aliens appeared, so he understood why the people of the outer galactic regions felt the way they did.She glanced at him out of the corner of her eye and gave a wry smile.The ship made a sharp turn for the space station and descended belly first toward an external security door on the outer hull.Within ten seconds they had landed.She reached out and pulled back a lever on the control console.Several large magnetic clamps secured the ship.Well done, Sara, he said as he stood up and entered the corridor that led to the back of his ship.Captain Michael was a tall and robust man with dark hair, fair skin and deep green eyes.His face was strong with angular features.For most of his adult life he had worked with salvage crews in the Outer Worlds, and he had learned everything he needed to know about salvaging whilst working on a variety of ships.Eventually he had progressed to captain his own ship, which was the end goal of almost every aspiring salvor.Michaels ship, the Out Drifter, was a Battle Class Armorstonian Cruiser.It was built in the arrival year 12371, which made it twenty five years old.The Armorstonians were known for building solid ships, and their cruisers were as rare as they were valuable.The battle class cruisers were originally constructed to contest the first incursion of the aliens into the Outer Worlds.Most of the Armorstonian ships had been destroyed when Armorston Prime fell to the relentless spread of the aliens across the galaxy.Michael had been lucky enough to salvage the Out Drifter as a wreck beyond human colonised space.How the ship found its way out beyond the colonies was anyones guess, but he suspected it had been abandoned and left to drift through space until eventually crash landing on a low gravity desert moon.The Out Drifter had been in his possession for nearly six years.He had made various alterations for salvaging operations.The ship was 70 metres in length, averaged about 25 metres in width, and shaped like an elongated triangular wedge.It boasted a modest cargo bay with nine deep sleep pods (two were damaged and beyond repair), a cramped engine room at the back, a small living room, an airlock chamber with a space door, four escape pods and a small armoury.He had increased the flat line acceleration by forty percent whilst travelling at sub interstellar speed.Other alterations included: a single 80mm charged particle cannon which was the main armament affixed to the top of the hull, two 35mm heavy pulse laser guns were attached to the underside, a gravitational harpoon, a high quality Epherian electronic shield system, two advanced rocket launchers, an external robotic arm and ten micro bots which patrolled the outer hull to prevent cloaked robots and other unsavoury parasites latching onto the ship.Michael entered the cargo bay.He eyed his crew who were waiting beside the exit door.Their names were Ajax, Ethan and Ivan.They were wearing mismatched armour and carrying an assortment of weapons and gear for the salvage mission.Ajax strained a smile and lifted up the oversized electromagnetic pulse gun.This thing is way too heavy.You know I hate carrying it.Dont complain, said Michael sharply.You wont regret it if we come across security droids inside the station.Ajax was a huge man with dishevelled black hair, dark eyes and a big moustache that dominated his weathered face.His bare arms were covered in an assortment of tattoos.Ajax liked to think of himself as the muscle of the team.He had been working on the Out Drifter for three years, and Michael knew he was someone who could be relied on in a difficult situation as he had proven his worth many times in the past.Ethan was standing beside Ajax.He was the resident mechanical engineer and an unassuming man who was slim, rather short, with a completely bald head.He wore intelligent glasses which covered the upper half of his face.The glasses allowed him to see in the dark, and they also had an inbuilt scanner that constantly analysed the visual field for any dangers or mechanical irregularities.Michael couldnt remember ever seeing Ethans eyes in the year he had been working on the Out Drifter.Ethan had joined the crew after working in a junkyard on Timber 5, and he was previously employed as a smuggler.He was always reluctant to talk about his days working in the smuggling industry, and Michael felt there was much in his past he wanted to forget about.Ivan was a tall and handsome synthetic android.He was a highly advanced machine and had been designed to appear completely human.He had fair skin, blue eyes, short brown hair which never changed in length, and he was exactly six feet in height.He had drifted away from a space station that had been destroyed by the aliens, and quite some time later the Out Drifters scanners had located him floating in the depths of space.Michael didnt have much time for androids.Robots that appeared human made him feel uneasy at the best of times.To make matters worse Ivan had accidentally been exposed to a radiation field that had scrambled some of his internal programming.He was still functional after the incident, but occasionally he would do something crazy like walk in circles whilst questioning why the world was spinning.Michael knew he would have to take Ivan to a robotics technician for repairs, but parts for high quality androids were expensive, and money was always short on the Out Drifter.Consequently, Ivans repairs were low on the priority list.Are we ready for action?asked Michael.Ready, Captain, replied Ethan as he loaded a fresh magazine into his plasma rifle.Michael slung his charged particle rifle over his shoulder as Ethan stepped toward the exit door and lifted up a handheld code breaker.The exit door of the Out Drifter slid open which revealed a locked external security door of the space station.The external security door of the Out Drifter had lined up with one of the many external security doors of the gigantic space station.Most external security doors throughout much of the galaxy were able to interlock with each other.This made it easier for people to move between ships and stations without the use of an airlock.Security doors were often protected by quantum encrypted codes, which led to quantum code breakers being an essential tool for a salvage crew.The space stations security codes are quantum encrypted with a dual layer, said Ethan.Hurry up and open the damn thing!said Ajax impatiently.Ethan placed the code breaker to the stations external door and configured the device.A few moments passed as they watched and waited.Why is it taking so long?grumbled Ajax.Ethan shrugged his shoulders.The code is very complex and has been configured with an observer defence mechanism which is preventing the coded layers of electron waves forming into electron particles.Every time I break the first code there is a second code lying dormant which instantly springs to life, and by the time I break the second code the first has reconfigured.Ajax rolled his eyes.We paid a fortune for that device.Its supposed to break double layered codes!Not when the codes reconfigure at this speed, said Ethan.Why doesnt anything ever work on this ship!yelled Ajax, clenching his fists.Captain Michael glanced sideways at Ajax and shook his head.Ajax, you still dont get it, he said coolly.The question is: why did the previous occupants use such a complex code?The answer is because there is something worth protecting.Be patient.I cant break the code, mumbled Ethan.We have to cut our way in.Those were the words Michael did not want to hear.Cutting into a space station was a sure way to draw the attention of security droids, and fighting security droids was the last thing he felt like doing; nonetheless, an abandoned space station was a goldmine for a salvage crew, and he knew the potential rewards made it worth the risk.Bring out the cutter, he said in a low voice.Keep your weapons ready.There could be a security droid waiting to greet us.Ajax walked down the corridor that led to the front of the ship.The armoury, which doubled as a tool room, was situated about half way between the control room at the front and the cargo bay at the back.A few moments later he returned with the laser cutter.He shuffled past Ethan and aligned it with the outer edge of the stations security door; a moment later a bright red laser beam caused sparks to blast out.Ajax traced the outline of the door within a minute and then drew back the cutter.The team lifted their weapons in readiness.Ajax looked back over his shoulder and gave a curt nod.He then kicked the door and the entire panel fell away and revealed a dark and empty corridor beyond.Michael lifted his wrist com.Sara, were going in.This shouldnt take too long.Keep the ship powered and ready just in case we need to leave in a hurry.you got it, Captain replied Sara over the wrist com.Ethan, light this place up, said Michael.Ethan drew a pistol and shot three small smoke flares into the corridor.The flares released a thin mist with charged luminescent particles which lit up the entire length of the way.The corridor was about fifty metres long with numbered doors along each side.At the far end was a second main door.Lets go to the storage hold and see what the Epherians left behind, said Michael as he stepped forward and advanced along the corridor.The others followed closely.Within a minute they had reached the second door.Ethan, do a scan.Theres absolutely nothing, Captain.Michael hit the green button beside the door and it slowly slid open.They had come to a T intersection.A wide service corridor ran through the centre of the space station.Dim emergency lighting was still operational along the length of the service corridor.Several lights were flickering which gave the station an eerie feeling.This place is bothering me, Captain, said Ajax.Why?There are no signs of a struggle, no radiation leak, and there are no aliens.Why would the population pack up and leave?It could have been a biological factor, suggested Ethan.You mean a plague?asked Ajax, frowning at the suggestion.No, it wasnt a plague, said Michael.There are no reported plagues in this sector of space, and the station management would simply remove the infected occupants and send in droids to sterilise everything.I can only see three possibilities: pirates, aliens or mutiny.This corridor leads to the storage hold, said Ethan.They continued down the service corridor.Before long they arrived at a large security door situated at the far side of the service corridor.Ethan was monitoring his handheld scanner which had a small screen that showed the basic floor plan of the space station.The door was locked to protect the contents of the storage hold.Ethan flipped the casing off the control panel beside the door and prepared to decode the lock.The door began opening.That was quick, said Michael.I didnt decode the lock.Its opening by itself, said Ethan.Michaels eyes narrowed and he lifted his rifle, but a moment later it was apparent that no one was on the other side.The door must be malfunctioning, said Ethan.Its probably set to a repeat time release.Directly in front of them was a large and dimly lit storage hold which was at least one hundred metres in length and about the same in height.A huge space door was situated at one side.The space door was big enough to allow a delivery ship to enter the hold.There were dozens of large shipping containers and several small cranes.Yay hey!said Ajax.They entered the hold.Ethan led the way and approached the first shipping container.Spare sleeping pods, he said after reading the digital manifest, which was connected to the side of the container.Theyre not worth the hassle, said Michael.But these are heavy duty self contained sleeping pods with their own life support systems, said Ethan.They are made for long haul space flight and they have independent power supplies.We could replace some of the Out Drifters aging pods with these.We could only fit about four or five into the cargo bay on the Out Drifter, and we dont have the time to replace the pods.Lets try the next container.They moved on and within a minute they had checked each shipping container manifest, but the containers were mostly filled with spare parts and mundane maintenance supplies.More than half the containers were loaded with carbon blocks, which were the raw ingredient used in food synthesizers.Looks like theres not much to salvage, grumbled Ajax.Its not over yet, said Michael.Well have to go after the reactor power accelerators.There should be about thirty of them.That only adds up to one hundred and fifty thousand credits, said Ajax.Its not much to split between us after costs.I know, said Michael.This is the nature of the business; sometimes you strike gold and sometimes its only dirt.We should make a move.You three go to the reactor and collect the power accelerators.Im going to the command room.Are you looking for the population manifest again?asked Ajax with a slight grin.Maybe, replied Michael in a low voice.Why do you always have to see the population manifests?Ethan gave a dry laugh.We have a bet between us about who youre looking for.Perhaps Im not looking for anyone, said Michael defensively.Your statement is not logical, said Ivan in his monotone voice.There is no other rational explanation.Maybe I just like population manifests, said Michael.I doubt it, said Ethan.The reactor is three levels above us.We can take the elevator on the far side of the storage hold.The service tunnel we came from leads all the way to the command room on the other side of the station.Be back at the Out Drifter in thirty minutes, said Michael as he turned toward the service corridor.He entered the corridor and continued for about two minutes until he arrived at the far end.He pressed the green button beside the door, which immediately slid open.Directly ahead was a set of five steps that led up to another door.The door automatically opened as he approached.The command room was dimly lit by emergency lighting.There were three main consoles and a holographic display table, which had a smooth top with several micro light projectors on the surface.The instruments and computers were off or running in dormant mode.Michael briskly walked towards the main computer and touched the control console.The smooth metal holographic panel began to glow.An image appeared in the air directly in front of him, and the word WELCOME formed.Computer, I request access to the population manifest.ACCESS DENIED  Emergency override.Code 799.The emergency override code 799 was the standard code used by rescue crews to access population manifests and other critical data required for a rescue mission.The code would only work if an emergency had been declared by the previous commanding officer.PARTIAL ACCESS GRANTED  Open the population manifest.POPULATION EPHERIAN OUTSTATION EP712674  TOTAL POPULATION: 4123  CURRENT POPULATION: 0  Computer, locate individual: Acacius Trifon.Captain Michael couldnt remember how many times he had made the same request without a positive result.ACACIUS TRIFON: PASSENGER 3712: AGE 59.EVACUATED  Michael felt a rush of adrenaline surge through his body.He had searched for so long and had almost given up hope.Computer.Where was Acacius Trifon evacuated to?ACCESS DENIED  No!Emergency override code 799.ACCESS DENIED  He lifted his wrist com.Ajax.I need the quantum code breaker here in the command room.Cap, were busy removing these power accelerators from the reactor housing replied Ajax.Forget the power accelerators.This is much more important.Cap, no power accelerators equals no money  Ajax, Ill pay everyone from my own savings.Just get over here as quickly as you can.No problem.We are coming  Michael waited in the command room for several minutes for his crew to arrive.The door slid open and they entered.Did you find your mystery person?asked Ethan.I found something, but the computer is blocking access to further information.Ethan placed the quantum code breaker on top of the main console.This might be a problem, Captain.Just remember the external security doors were double encrypted.They may have used a more powerful encryption on the main computer, he said as he powered up the device.Just do your best, said Michael.Ethan started to operate the code breaker as Michael watched on.Its just as I thought, Captain.The main computer is using a double quantum encryption with a complex, observer protected pathway.Keep trying.Ethan nodded and focused his full attention on the device.Wait, Captain, the main computer is returning to full power.What?Its like the computer just woke up, he said as he kept working to break the codes.Ethan put the quantum code breaker down; his brow furrowed and he shook his head.The main computer just removed all the access codes in the entire station.Were into the system, but I dont know why its allowing us in.Michael turned to face the holographic console.Computer.Where was passenger Acacius Trifon evacuated to?ESCAPE CRAFT TRAJECTORY: ZENO PAR  All the lights in the command room automatically switched on, and the instruments and consoles lit up.The team instinctively lifted their weapons.Computer.What happened on this space station?Why did the population evacuate?asked Michael.SECURITY SYSTEM IMMOBILISATION WAS ATTEMPTED BY THE PREVIOUS COMMANDING OFFICER   QUARANTINE OVERRIDE SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED  What?Computer, provide more detail.THE HUMAN POPULATION POSED A RISK TO THE STABILITY OF EP712674.SECURITY MEASURES WERE REQUIRED AND IMPLEMENTED.SECURITY PROGRAM SUCCESSFULLY REMOVED THE POTENTIAL HUMAN HAZARD.I think the computer has a virus, said Ethan.Computer, how did the security program remove the potential human hazard?asked Michael.48 RESIDENT EPHERIAN BATTLE DROIDS WERE MOBILISED FOR THE OPERATION  Epherian Battle Droids were considered by all space farers to be the most dangerous battle droids in the entire galaxy.They were constructed in a humanoid shape; however, they were seven feet in height with high grade armour.The baseline model always had a mini rocket launcher connected to one shoulder and a laser system connected to the other.They also carried standard issue Epherian charged particle rifles, which was an advanced weapon by any estimation.They were given the nickname Blueys because the scanner attached to their chests was marked by a bright, blue light.The blood drained from Michaels face.Battle droids, said Ethan in a low and nervous voice.Captain, we have to get out of here.Agreed, said Ajax sternly.Michaels wrist com beeped.Sara.Whats going on?Captain, the entire station has powered up.My scanners have detected droids approaching your position.They are moving like battle droids; theyre in the service corridor.You have about twenty seconds!Get out of there!...Were trapped!yelled Ajax.Weld the door!shouted Michael.Ethan dashed forward and grabbed a handheld welder from his pack.This wont hold for long, Captain!The Blueys will break through in a few seconds, he said, rushing his words.He used his welder to melt the steel door to the frame.A huge dent appeared from a heavy impact on the other side.Lets go.This way!yelled Michael.They followed Michael through a side door.A narrow corridor cut away from the command room.About thirty seconds later they came to a sharp right hand turn; they faced another door.Michael pressed the green operation button, but the door didnt open.The main computer is attempting to seal us in, said Ivan.Captain, theyve broken through the door!shouted Ethan, who was watching the corridor that led back to the command room.Hold them off!yelled Michael as he lifted his rifle and fired on the locked door.Ethan opened fire as the battle droids appeared in the corridor.The droids fired back; a torrent of bright orange charged particle beams shot by.Ajax moved up beside Ethan, and he pointed the electromagnetic pulse gun at the approaching Blueys.He pulled the trigger; three battle droids instantly powered down and fell to the ground.A second group of battle droids, which were further down the corridor, stopped in their tracks and quickly retreated to the command room.Captain, the electromagnetic pulse gun stopped them, said Ajax with a smile.Theyre retreating!Theyll be back!Theyre programmed not to give up until were dead, and they have ways of dealing with electromagnetic weapons.Michael fired on the locked door again and then kicked it open.Directly ahead was a small medical room.His wrist com beeped.Whats happening, Sara?Captain, I have to detach.A group of battle droids have discovered the Out Drifters position.Four of them are approaching the attachment point.They will board the ship if I dont leave now.Ill attempt to reattach at a different location  If you detach well be trapped on the space station, said Ethan.The battle droids will intercept any attempt you make to reattach.Captain!I need to go, now!...Okay, Sara, detach, he said, his face becoming stony.Detaching, Captain  The team turned to Michael.No one said a word for a few moments.Ethan glanced down at his scanner and his jaw dropped.Captain, the computer is opening the exterior ventilation ducts.Its purposely causing a complete decompression.Well be exposed to the vacuum of space.Were going to die in here.How long do we have?asked Michael.Ethan examined the scanner for a moment.Three or four minutes; we dont have time to make it out, even if Sara finds a suitable reattachment point.Ethan, where is the escape pod launching bay?asked Michael.Captain, if the entire population evacuated there wont be any escape pods left, said Ethan.Just tell me where they are, said Michael firmly.The handheld scanner showed the entire station level by level.Ethan quickly completed a scan for the escape pod launching bay.We have to return to the storage hold.The escape pod launching bay is on the opposite side.Follow me!said Michael as he ran back toward the command room.This is a bad idea, Cap, said Ajax as they followed.Have that electromagnetic pulse gun ready.The battle droids think we are on the run; they wont expect us to attack.A moment later they dashed into the command room.Michael opened fire; charged particle beams blasted over the consoles.Five battle droids whirled around to face them.Two of them fell as the beams cut directly through them.Ajax fired the electromagnetic pulse gun, and two more droids powered down instantly, but the remaining battle droid managed to dodge the onslaught.The Blueys rocket launcher began unleashing, and its charged particle rifle fired rapidly.Take cover!yelled Michael.Michael dived behind a console and Ajax was thrown to the ground by the backlash of a rocket exploding beside him.Ethan returned fire, but the beams from his plasma rifle were hitting an invisible magnetic shield.Ivan ran forward with his plasma rifle blazing, but the shield was too strong and the plasma beams dissipated.The battle droid turned to face Ivan and opened fire.Ivan, realising the danger, leapt for cover behind a console.His left arm tore away from his body at the shoulder leaving exposed grey synthetic muscle and loose wiring.Captain, I am hit; my arm is missing, he said in monotone.Ill order you a new one when we get out of this place, yelled Michael.Ajax and Michael were taking cover behind the main control console.Ethan was hiding behind the holographic table.The battle droid was waiting beside the door that led to the service corridor.The room was clouded with smoke from the exploding rockets.The Bluey is protected by a magnetic shield, whispered Michael.That shield only works against particle, plasma and electromagnetic weapons, said Ajax.Did you bring any projectile weapons?Just this, he replied, drawing a large combat knife.Youve got to be joking, said Michael, shaking his head.Ajax smiled dryly.Dont worry, Cap.This one was sharpened by nano bots.Make a distraction now!Michael leapt up, yelled at the top of his lungs, and sprinted across the room as he simultaneously fired his rifle.The charged particle beams struck the magnetic shield as the battle droid turned to face him.In the same moment Ajax jumped up and threw the knife with all his might.The blade passed directly through the magnetic shield, striking the droids blue glowing sensor.Sparks blasted out in every direction.The Bluey instantly lurched forward and collapsed as it powered down.Come on.Lets go!The air is starting to thin, shouted Michael.The team ran into the service corridor and made their way as quickly as possible to the storage hold.They arrived at the security door at the far end within a minute, but the door was locked.Its the computer trying to stop us escaping!shouted Ajax.Do you have those magno explosives?asked Michael.Right here, Captain, replied Ethan.Blast the lock off!Just give me a second.Ethan placed two small metal boxes on the side where the lock was mounted.The explosives were the size of matchboxes; they magnetically attached to the door.Step back.They moved back.Ethan then switched the remote.The charges detonated and blasted the lock off.Michael and Ajax ran forward, and together they heaved the door open.They entered the storage hold and proceeded as quickly as they could.The air was becoming so thin that it was difficult to breathe.Only Ivan was unaffected.Ethan opened the door at the far side of the storage hold; they entered the escape pod launching room.Michaels eyes quickly scanned the pod bays; there were no remaining escape pods.Ethan hung his head.This is it, Captain.We are going to suffocate.I will survive this incident, said Ivan.I can continue functioning in a vacuum.Ajax rolled his eyes.Lucky you, he said.Its been nice working with you, said Ethan in a cheerless voice.Michael shook his head.He had come so far and couldnt give up now.Follow me, he said, his voice faltering from lack of breath.Its over, Captain, said Ethan grimly.Not until I say it is, replied Michael as he walked back into the storage hold.Ethan.Are the seals on those spare sleeping pods space worthy?Yes, they are, but even if we get in them we wont be able to get away from the space station, and by the time anyone can rescue us we will be found and killed by the battle droids.What about the shipping container?Is it vacuum proof?It should be.Ivan wont run out of air, said Michael.Follow me.They quickly crossed the storage hold; Michael opened the shipping container with the sleeping pods.Get into the sleeping pods.I would rather die fighting the battle droids, said Ajax, his face hardening.Youre not going to die, said Michael.Ethan is right; this is another bad idea, added Ajax.Just get into the shipping container, commanded Michael as he grabbed the quantum code breaker from Ethan.Ethan and Ajax followed his order.Not you, Ivan.I need you to seal the container from the outside and then break the quantum code on the storage hold space door.We are going to float away from this space station.But, Captain, I will be sucked out into space, said Ivan.Dont worry; you will be fine; remember I originally found you floating in space.I know you can do this, Ivan.Dont let me down.His wrist com beeped again.Captain  Yes, Sara?There are four battle droids approaching your positionyou have about thirty seconds  Ivan, go!he shouted as he stepped into the shipping container.Ivan sealed the shipping container door from the outside and then sprinted across to the manual control console of the storage hold space door.With his one remaining hand he powered up the quantum code breaker.The outer space door had a double quantum encryption and also needed an approval code from the central computer.Ivan lifted his wrist com.Captain, the door cannot be opened.The four battle droids entered the storage hold from the service corridor.Ivan dropped the quantum code breaker and reached for his plasma rifle which was slung over his shoulder, but the battle droids opened fire before he could point the rifle.A blast of charged particles tore through his chest.He was thrown back and his rifle slid away across the floor.He immediately sat up and drew his pistol.Sparking wires were hanging out of a gaping hole in his chest.He fired several shots at the droids, but their laser systems burst into operation.Several bright red beams cut directly through his synthetic body; an instant later he fell back and powered down.The battle droids finished Ivan said Sara.No!yelled Michael.Now this is a tight situation, said Ajax with a grimace.Not only are we nearly out of air, but we are locked and sealed in this shipping container and surrounded by Epherian battle droids.Do you have any more bright ideas?One or two, said Michael under his breath as he lifted his wrist com.Sara.I want you to fire the Out Drifters rocket launchers at the storage holds space door.You want me to what?...Fire rockets at the storage holds outer space door, he repeated.but, Captain, I  Sara, fire the rockets.Thats an order.Ajax shook his head and wiped his brow.If we survive this Im going to buy you a trophy, he said, a grim smile crossing his lips.Get into a sleeping pod!Were going to make it.Ive always admired your overconfidence, Cap, said Ajax as he reluctantly hopped into one of the sleeping pods; Ethan had already slid into another.Seal your pods, shouted Michael.What about you, Cap?
