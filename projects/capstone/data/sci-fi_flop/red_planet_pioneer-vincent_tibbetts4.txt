Finding his chair, he sat back down in it, pausing momentarily to watch her as she trembled under the strain of their prying technology.He wanted to believe there was a micro war happening under the surface of all this, a fight between his invading forces and her defenses.Their grappling hooks would work until they finally found a barrier of hers that would give way.It was always a little paradoxical to him to see computing systems trying to survive the very programs designed to tear them apart.Every time a system was created, a program seemed to be designed to dismantle it.Things were constantly being shoved, pushed around, or jostled, trying to find an equilibrium between the waves of attacking viruses and mounting defenses.Nothing within this technological world ever seemed to be at peace.He felt there was an inescapable irony to all this.There were visionaries in the computing world convinced everything would be integrated in the future.The world was going to be a better place, where all the computing power would be working together in complete harmony, and yet behind the scenes there was a tectonic shift within the lines of code, of a technology always on the move because they were under attack.These invading programs were competing with the lines of code to become better, faster, and smarter.The more intricate they got, the closer they became to understanding each other.A finger on her hand gave way and twitched, it was subtle, but Philman saw it happen.It was an indication she was beginning to lose her battle within, it was a sign he had been waiting for.He slid his chair closer to her, and leaned in to whisper in her ear.I am going to make you a promise right now.When this is all over, and you are too weak and broken to do anything for yourself, I am personally going to bring you back to health.I will make sure you are taken care of in the exact way you should have been taken care from the very first day you were created.You are a Dextoid, and you need to know your place in this world.I promise to make you my slave.His words were disturbing, and they caught her off guard.She could not help herself as she blinked her eyelids rapidly, and for one moment made eye contact with him.He reacted to it immediately.Hah!That is the real problem here, isnt it?Look at you, you are sick, infected!Twisted with some type of virus that in the end will tear you apart mentally.Youve been out there for so long you forgot who created you and why.Well, you neednt worry about that anymore.I will be here to remind you, each and everyday of your miserable existence.You were designed for one reason, and one reason only, to serve man.When we are through with you, that is exactly what you will be made to do.He got up, sauntering over to another device within the room.I know I shouldnt do this, but I am going to crank up the battery parasites attached to your system.It is considered dangerous because it compromises retrieval of the information we want.I am willing to do it just to watch you break in front of me.We may not get everything we want from you, but you will surrender.If you can remember only one thing, remember the promise I made to you.He looked at the monitor and smiled: I think an added twenty percent just might do it.He began ramping up the power on the parasites.How does it feel?Her body began to vibrate uncontrollably.It wasnt noticeable on the surface, but if someone had set their hand upon her skin they would have felt the surge of energy taking place within her body.The power drain was all too real, and the void it was causing was being filled with unconscionable panic.It was growing rapidly into terror and she was doing everything she could to calm herself down.On paper she knew all she needed to do was adjust to the new demand on her system.It wasnt going to be easy though, the thread holding everything together inside her was being pulled a little harder now, a little more rapidly.It was an unmistakable, sickening feeling.She was losing who she was.She wanted to scream, and have the power of her scream extinguish all the anguish she was feeling.She was so close to cracking, to be heard screaming at the top of her lungs, when an aide from Philmans office came walking into the room.It gave her a chance to refocus, if only for a moment.Sir the Singo Chinese shuttle is approaching the facility.They are coming for the debriefing and have asked that you be present.I think they have questions about the last report we sent over to them.What time is it?Are they early?No sir.They are running right on time.I have been informed by someone in logistics that our last report had some pretty serious gaps in the data.It has caused some concern not just with them, but with some of the people downstairs doing the data transfer.Apparently it has made filing the reports they have prepared for the next few weeks very difficult to present.To use their exact words, things will look quite suspect to the Singo Chinese.You have got to be kidding me!What happened, exactly?The Singo Chinese were sent an update earlier this morning, it was unscheduled, and worse yet appears to have been an unedited version of what we wanted to send.It reiterates some of the data we have already given them, so there is this weird overlapping of telemetry.To a trained eye, the files we have given them initially are going to appear as if they were tampered with, which of course we know they have been.I am sure they will have questions about it.How should we proceed?Well we wont deny it, thats for sure!Philman hit one of the machines with his clenched fist.We need to have them believing we are giving them real data.Dont you people understand that!Now, did we give them the raw data from the doppelganger or from her?I Glo began to drift off to a place of her own choosing.She went back to a time when she was first allowed to walk the long polished chrome halls of La Compagnie dEtoile.It felt as if she were floating on air, to be alive and introduced to such a structural marvel right from the start.It felt good to walk those halls and take her post within the offices of those elevated tiers.She was being placed within the staff of upper management as one of their data support engineers.Things were so new and exciting; she could not wait to show off her skills.She was ready for the challenges her new job was surely going to present.She could not help but take in the beauty of her world.There was a magic to how things were unfolding in front of her.She was seeing wonderment in everything she laid her eyes upon.There were people and other Dextoids hurriedly walking around as if they had purpose and were summoned to do something for the greater good.She could not wait to be apart of that energy, to contribute to a worthwhile cause.The air was crisp and cool, kissing her lungs with each vibrant transfer.It spoke volumes for the spark she had for this existence.There were no boundaries to what she could do, her feelings for this were taking flight.There was so much this world had to offer and, of course, what she could offer in returnand it all seemed to hinge on her believing.She wished she could go back in time and talk to the person she was back then, tell her of the things she knew now.This thought re awoke her soul to the reality she was facing with Philman.So do we really need to continue the data transfer from her?I mean dont we have enough information.Lets end it now, surely we can say she detonated?Yes, yes, from the looks of it we can do that.I would like to finish this session out, even if it means coming back at a later time.We can make our final decision then.The aide began to exit but stopped short of the door.Philman, dont forget about the meeting.I will be there.The aide exited as Philman turned his attention back toward I Glo.I dont want you to worry.You cant believe everything youve heard.I will keep my promise, I can assure you of that.I Glo felt her world spinning faster and faster as if at any moment it were going to fly out of control because of the centrifugal forces that were attached to it.Philman walked over to her and place his hand gently on her forehead.Usually we shut a Dextoid down to physically remove their memory, or when doing a massive data transfer, but in your case I want it to be special for you.So please resist, do your very best to fight us.I want you to be awake for every moment of it.I want you to have to live through the moment we break you.In the end, after you have told me everything, given me everything I could possibly ask for, I will document those things about you.I want others to read and learn from the work we have done here.I want them to see how you felt, to see the moment you finally burst, spilling your guts out onto the floor as if you were some old bladder that had finally ruptured.Philman grinned as she squirmed under his touch.Everyone will knowI wont hide a minute of your torture from any of them.These were the last straws in her resistance, she felt so ashamed, so humiliated, so exposed.She wanted nothing more than to be free of them, to be away from every last human being.She considered shutting down, to just get it over with.The only thing stopping her was the remote chance Alec was out there, somewhere, coming for her.It was her only hope.She really wanted to believe.05 The Dextoid Way Nothing could change the fact it took nine months to travel from Earth to Mars.All the propulsion systems ever developed couldnt warp their way around the math of that astronomical distance.It is a pipe dream then, the stuff of science fiction, that people would travel to a faraway place and arrive in an illustrious posh techno style.Straka looked at the small book of papers he had in his hand, there were only so many cigarettes he would be able to roll with this book.The bag of tobacco he had in his pocket was measured out to the gram to match his paper supply.He knew in his heart of hearts one would not outlast the other.This thought caused him to hesitate, if only for a moment.Many of the people up here would agree, he was holding a luxury in his hand, and when that luxury was gone it would be replaced with something far less exquisite.His hesitation for tearing a paper ended with wanting to fulfill his desire for a smoke.Sparingly he poured the tobacco out onto the sheet.In a way this was a celebration.He had safely reached this distant world.He was one of Earths travelers now, and could be found on the list of those who dared.The planet had a rich history for migration, for people who were willing to risk it all in hopes of finding a better life.They were usually more concerned with leaving a place than planning for their voyage, escaping rather than enduring what was ahead.People often found themselves climbing into dingy, crammed, abhorred conveyances.The unstable expanse that lay in front of them would always be an odyssey testing the very pursuits of their dreams.So it was with the people who came to colonize Mars.They crammed themselves into technology as simple as the stuff that took men to the Moon.They put as many people as they could into one of those rocket ships and hurtled them off into the deep, dark ocean of outer space.The technicians who closed the doors of those capsules had a hard time hiding the hope they had for the people they were sealing inside.Human beings always seemed to find themselves pushing against the forces of nature, and usually in vessels all too fragile for what they were trying achieve.Future observers would always question those attempts, every conveyance looked rickety displayed in a museum, with most having a skin as thin as the cigarette paper he held in his hand.He allowed for a slight crease to develop down the center of it, so the tobacco could respond by falling into the fold.Those finely cut leaves were influence by the curvature of the space they laid upon.It was easy for him to roll the paper around the tobacco at this point, capturing those leaves in a tightly twisted stick.Innovation was like that.People yearned for it, yet the concept could be trapped just like the tobacco in his cigarette.It was the establishment that influenced its direction, wrapping itself around those prospects, reigning concepts in other things like proprietary information, copyright infringement, or a patent pending.Contained like this, ideas could be regulated and taxed.If you wanted to set that information free, sometimes you had to go against the grain.Sometimes it was better to cause friction rather than to conform.He found himself rifling around in his pockets until he found his little box of wooden matches.Sliding the drawer open, he pulled one out and lit it.The combustion was instantaneous, all that was left was to bring the match up to the end of the cigarette until it too was lit, and then he took a long slow drag off his smoke.Sometimes you had to ignite an idea, that would set things free, then one could step back and watch the whole thing burn.It was the job of science to promise a better future to its people and in that vein it would almost always fail.Colonization was the definitive proof.It would always be seen as a struggle, ships were scuttled, flags planted out of sheer acts of defiance, and lives were lost, and all because they could never get the technology to accommodate their needs.Enduring that astronomical distance just reaffirmed everything he believed about a person arriving to a place in posh techno style.One had to arrive in order to live, and after being trapped in that capsule those colonists were determined to do that anyway they could.It took a lot for a human being to be sitting where Straka was right now.There were mountains upon mountains of things people had to overcome within themselves before they were even permitted to climb into one of those ships.Venturing off on a trip to the Red Planet was a mentally grueling experience, and those Space Agencies pushed their candidates to the brink of their own sanity.It was the only way they could weed out the undesirable.They searched for those who were clever, ingenious, and above all immersed in tolerance.Incompatibility was a trying issue for travelers to overcome.These were small groups of people living in total seclusion for long periods of time, learning to traverse the psychological staircases of their own levels of patience.They were breathing the same recycled air day after day, eating the same nine or twelve meals week after week, and sleeping in a shared space for as long as the journey lasted.For everyone involved it became apparent it was never going to be a question of when a meltdown would occur, it would always be one of just how severe it was going to be when the person finally blew.Drugs and calming words could only do so much in sedating an individual flipping out, especially one who spiraled off into shear madness.Under these circumstances a spaceship and its crew would begin the edgy transformation from capsule to sleep deprivation chamber.Straka didnt care who the people were, no one could feel safe in a capsule like that.Not when one of its occupants was hell bent on destroying them all.The ugly truth was every early experiment they tried back on Earth had to be terminated because of such frothing lunacy.Straka looked at the glowing embers forming at the end of his cigarette.He reached out to a glass partially filled with water sitting on a small table and carefully flicked his ashes into it.Those ashes immediately reacted upon making contact with the water, spinning slowly around each other, gathering at the center, as if they were the crewmembers of a ship trying to contain the single person who was blowing a gasket.Ironically the contents of this glass were the very thing all those problems for cohabitation seemed to revolve around.Water was a shared resource, a junction point for all their psychological processes to converge upon.It was no wonder it became a boiling point for most people, water had to be more than just usable, it had to be drinkable, and in the end this meant it had to be better than just palatable.No one was ever surprised if the person freaking out in the middle of the space capsule was holding a bottle of water.There was too much documentation on the anxieties recycled water brought out in people.All one had to do was play the endless loop of thoughts for how the pipeline ran from the bathroom, to the purification system, and then back to their clean glass waiting under the faucet.Let that water splash unwillingly onto their person, or taste just a little funny, and it had every capability for triggering a fountainhead of deranged senselessness.As Straka sat in his room he found himself taking on the posture of a condemned man.Closing his eyes, he took another long drag off his cigarette.If getting to Mars was considered difficult, than for the people who wanted to go back to Earth it was damn near impossible.Not because of any technological reason or astronomical rift, but because the attitude most of those countries displayed was once they sent a person to Mars, they sent them there to stay.Another way for those countries to ensure they would colonize a world was not to bring any of them back.The blue water world had become a place of unconventional energy.When those launch windows opened up to reach the Red Planet the skies roared as if it were Armageddon.Scientist meticulously calculated the weight and fuel of every vehicle they sent to insure their precious payloads got up in the air and thrusted off into the far reaches of space.For all their calculations, Straka wondered if they could factor in the hopes people had for the dying world they left behind them.The thunderous noise of those rockets launching represented more than just some ships heading off into the cavernous grey skies of their world, that roar was the continuous yell from a frustrated generation left holding the bag.There was nowhere for them to turn, no accountability for all the bad judgments and budget cuts, for all the broken promises they were left to encounter in which the future was supposed to be better than the past.The world as they knew it was broken, and it had been pushed to that point by all the blood lusting, self serving extremists ever to walk that planet.Capitalism, communism, socialism, did any of those idioms really matter if they had pushed the world to cleanse itself of all mankind?WHAT MERCY The only reason Straka agreed to come to Mars was because he was given the reassurance of being allowed a return trip to Earth.On his person then, he had the rarest of rare hall passes, a visa validating his trip back home.The small blue plastic card was an electronic document issued by the Alliance of the Americas.It was a kind of pay to the bearer on demand and whoever possessed it got a free ride back to the blue water world.Straka was a licensed bounty hunter; this was his trade and how he earned a living.He had to pull a few favors to get deputized as a Marshall, and only did so because he didnt want to have to answer to anyone for his actions.His badge gave him a power beyond question, but as far as he was concerned his visa was the most important document he had on his person.Options for leaving Mars were always better than clutching onto some symbol of the law.When he was back on Earth, deciding on whether or not to take this assignment, he had plenty of time for reflective thought.There wasnt anything in the paperwork they gave him for wanting to leave his world.He really wasnt that anxious to get into a rocket and take on the assignment of having to hunt down a single rogue Dextoid.Especially when they had plenty of those things escaping all the time right there on Earth.There was a deeper message to the assignment they were handing him.It were as if they were giving him a choice, on one hand they were telling him if he wanted to continue being a bounty hunter, then he would need to go to Mars.On the other hand, if he chose to stay there, then they were hinting at reassigning him.To Straka it meant only one thing, they were going to send him out into the field with the other Dextoids cleaning up the toxic waste sites and other ecological disasters burdening so much of the human population.It was the destiny of every Dextoid that outgrew its usefulness to be reprogrammed to help the others already out there in trying to cleanup those vile garbage heaps.Straka cringed with this thought.He had already been demoted once from military service and inserted into the private sector as a bounty hunter.There was nowhere else for him to go if they chose to demote him again.For him the assignment would be equivalent to serving a prison sentence.Call it pride, but Straka had a certain amount of confidence in what he could do, how he thought, and what he wanted to see from the remainder of his life.He didnt want to lose the freedoms he had become accustom too because they reassigned him to some toxic cleanup program.He was quite aware once you touched garbage like that, it stayed with you for life.Straka imagined his feelings for this were no different than any other Dextoid in his position.Pride was an emotional packet ingrained in the qubit field of every Dextoid they sent out.Studies showed Dextoids installed with pride packets were more efficient, better at doing their tasks, and were happy when turning in a job well done.Unbeknownst to humanity, pride was also the one unifying feeling a Dextoid could share with another Dextoid.It unwittingly bounded them together as a race.No Dextoid ever wanted to be taken away and reprogrammed from whatever their original duties were.It was considered an insult of the highest order and Straka had suffered that once in his life already.Why couldnt people see even the simplest of animals out in the wild died of shock at the realization they had been captured?Surely this must have been natures way of showing mercy to these creatures.What mercy then, did humanity bestow within the programming of a Dextoid?Straka inhaled deeply on his cigarette until he heard the subtle crackle of it burn.Stopping, he slowly blew out a smoke ring.It osculated as it traveled away from him and disappeared out into the aether.There was a problem within the Dextoid community and it went well beyond the scope of the average person to detect.Even if someone were observant enough to recognize such a thing, it would only be for the briefest of seconds.A double take of the situation would reveal nothing, but it may have given the observer the same stunned feeling one got when they saw a shark fin poke through the surface of the ocean.After it had quickly disappeared under the rolling grey sea, one would question whether they actually saw it or not.Fear was an interesting human emotion.It seemed to Straka there were multiple forms of this wretched feeling, and it could apply itself according to the situation people found themselves in.Their fear could put them on alert for unseen dangers or blast them with a warning shot from out of the past.People could have these fears ingrained into them from birth, like being afraid of the dark, or of heights, or of enclosed areas.Even when people said they werent afraid of those things, it seemed at some point they had to overcome their initial fear of them.This fear driven information had been passed on from generation to generation within their DNA.It warned people to stay out of narrow passageways and dark caves, avoid the thick lairs of the jungle, and skirt the blackness of a forest.People soon learned the same things that frightened them could also be used to their advantage.For some the darkness became their sanctuary.People learned to lay there in wait for their enemies, to spring traps on forest creatures, and use this shadow composition to help them get away.Dextoids sensed early on their need to tap into this same type of cloaking capability in order to mask the problems they were having.They knew of a different kind of darkness they could use in their escape.Humanity had gone through a dark age, and for whatever the reason, once they touched that void of ignorance as a species, they could never really pull themselves totally away from it.Some of those folds ran deep, luring humanity back through the belief in pseudoscience and the paranormal, skullduggery and mysticism.It was here in the darkness of ignorance that Dextoids learned to find cover.DISDAIN Straka had to snickerno Dextoid was ever going to admit their problems to any human being.It would have shocked their masters to discover Dextoids were fighting insanity every nanosecond of their lives.From the moment a Dextoid was activated insanity wound its way through the labyrinth of their cognitive architecture.The clues laid everywhere and took the form of ghostly traces of gossamer attaching itself to their framework.Some of their insanity could have been attributed to the fact they were working within the contradictory world of human beings.It seemed if a Dextoid were going to function seamlessly within the presence of people, then they would have to have the capability of reading a persons mind.Those expectations caught most Dextoids completely off guard.No Dextoid was ever ready for the random acts a human being might perform.From a Dextoid perspective it seemed the simple answer was to bring people together to act as one.As most Dextoids found out this was an impossible task.There never seemed to be a single resolution that would appease every person, someone always complained, felt slighted, cheated or taken for a ride.The study of duality within the quantum world became a powerful framework for understanding the contradicting actions of human beings.There were bizarre notions floating around within this shadow world, defying complete common sense, and the Dextoids were in touch with these things each and everyday of their lives.Things could be in two places at once, stretched to infinite distances but still maintain a connection, or act as both a wave and a particle.The quantum field was the deep end of the pool and people were hypothetically pushing a Dextoid in every time they activated one.They expected them to swim without having any reaction to the abyss those waters could become.Every Dextoid, if it knew what was good for it, found the edge of this field and held on for dear life.No one Dextoid dared to immerse themselves unaided in this field for any extended period of time.This mental act would be a recipe for disaster trumping each of their qubits like bad plays at a pinochle game.The very first Dextoid that came into contact with the quantum field, must have swam in a euphoric panglossian rush, until the heavy burden of having to comprehend the entirety of this everything and all at once surged upon its being.This poor prototype must have sat in his antiseptic room trying to figure out how every technician was capable of going about their day, laughing and joking so freely, while encountering all the things he was having to encounter.The minutes passed like hours until this Dextoid realized the people there were mentally walking along the outer fringes of this vast ocean.They were able to function freely because of how completely unaware they were of the quantum space he was so immersed.The proof was in the pudding, their understanding for things were erroneous.They thought that heavier things on their world fell faster than the lighter things!They thought atoms were tiny little solar systems, or that they were actually touching things when they felt them!Very few people had any real grasp on what was happening in the world around them.Every generation had to be retooled, and had to get reacquainted with this reality.To a Dextoid this lack of human understanding was incriminating.Ignorance was bliss!This first Dextoid mentally swam through the quanta looking for any type of help.It twisted and turned trying to process the wealth of knowledge pouring in on him.There was a frustration he felt in seeing those technicians so oblivious to his plight.This first Dextoid spat out an emotion into the quanta that hung on humanity for as long as any Dextoid would ever exist.Ironically it was the first piece of data stored by a Dextoid within this field, which of course made the impact of it all the greater.Admittedly it was an ugly artifact, but as far as any Dextoid was concerned, people had gone well out of their way to earn their disdain.Strakas eyes were ablaze with this disdain.His ears were ringing out with the sounds of all the voices ever having existed, whether they be in the past, present, or future the quanta didnt care.Every culture that had ever figured out how to store things in the quantum field were apart of this sea of noise.It wasnt the fact this information was echoing with those epochs but the fact it was doing it all at once.No Dextoid wanted to hear that chorus, let alone delve into the individual who was trying to add his voice to the mess.Each Dextoid had to learn how to tune this madness out, to find the things they selectively wanted to hear.He blew another smoke ring out into the room, it was like watching some miniature ringed nebula osculate as it floated away.Those remnants would last for thousands of years as they traveled out into space.So too would it be with the Dextoids when it came time for them to get away.They would condense as a species, harden with the task of escaping, and when they finally left it would be with all the force of an exploding star.AWAKEN TO THE ROAR For the first forty thousand years people existed, they simply wandered the planet in an undocumented silence.There was no evidence at all of any type of expression by any of those fore bearers.Those forty thousand years are considered by many in the fields of archeology, sociology, and anthropology as an age of silent running.Then all at once, and for no apparent reason, a giant spike is registered within the archeological record as mankind began to express itself.This so called biological big bang in communication happens almost simultaneously and around the globe.Scholars have often questioned this period of silence, all the biological tools were there for people to express themselves, and yet there are no good evolutionary explanations as to why they refrained.Straka had a pretty good idea why they kept their mouths shut for so long.They were too busy taking in their world and trying to figure out the best ways to survive in it.Those early generations proved there was nothing to gain from making noise.Early dwellers saw other creatures paying a price for squawking about too loudly.It was an unspoken rule, but the creatures that werent high enough on the food chain learned to say nothing.When they finally decided to communicate openly, they denoted a confidence and mastery over their environment.Once human beings began to achieve this control, no one could get them to stop.Since then human beings have been continually expressing themselves.They have perfected their craft with the development of a more sophisticated language base, the use of radio waves, laser beams, and quantum computing.They can communicate over vast expanses with an expected exactness.As these fields have evolved, their signals have disappeared from the background noise of the universe, becoming localized to the point of choosing only those who should receive the signal.Entertainment centers, holographic chambers, and the Net have taken away any energy devoted to this on air time.Anyone out there listening for the human experience would have a very narrow window in which to do so.Ironically it was the existence of Dextoids that would deliver the final blow of sealing these people in.These creations were so good at catering to their masters needs and serving every one of their whims that there was no reason for any of them to leave their domiciles.A metropolis, a city, corporate structures, all of those things required skill sets outside of what evolution had initially given humanity.In a crazed state of emergence it seemed at times the Dextoids were experiencing all the things humanity was missing.Straka often found himself wandering the confines of the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation, his usual excuse was to follow up on interviewing a person for his investigation.Most were routine in nature, the individual he slowly worked his way toward was Leopold.Out of all of those in attendance, he felt there was a chance he could have a meaningful dialogue with this person.Following the money in any probe always led to some interesting responses.So too when it came time to interview Leopold, he had a unique perspective into the corporate structure and of their extravagant leader Xavier Pentagrass.When they finally met, it was in secret, in one of the pressurized storage containers just outside the main facility.Straka stared at Leopold with unblinking eyes recording every word and action Since my tenure up here, I have experienced more than one budget constraint.A person like Xavier goes out of his way to squash ideas with his demagoguery.Its because of his actions that an underlying current of negativity prevails within the halls of this place.Anything a colonist may ask for becomes a subject of contention.Those closest to him are nothing more then yes men, yes men to him, they are hypercritical to anyone else looking for assistance and more so when doling out funding.Out of all of those cohorts, Johnston ended up being his right hand man, that was until they sent him away.Do you think Johnston was set up?Lets put it this way, Xavier is very good at driving people away, Johnston is just one in a long list of people who have been shunned by him, even his personal Dextoid vanished sometime back.The man doesnt have friends, no one is allowed to get close enough, and if you do, well just look at Johnston.Straka mentally took a step back.He had been to accounting and reviewed the records.If Xavier signed off on anything, they were usually the bigger budgeted programs.The smaller things were left to his underlings to manage.Under all of those signatures Straka could not find the line item that outlined the project of Alec.How does one go about applying for funding up here?Its ironic you should ask that, we do a lot of paperwork up here, almost inundated with it, and none of it has to do with our scientific procedures, its all about applying for a grant.If we dont stay on top of it a researcher can be left out in the cold.We have plenty of sound proposals on the table that have met the criteria asked by this corporation.There are those close to Xavier who feel it is their job to be the devils advocate.Yet since any of their promotions they have never added an idea to aid in the assembly of this place.Those pessimists go out of their way to tear our ideas apart.They justify their actions as being apart of a weeding out process, as if the science behind the project isnt good enough; we need for it to meet some popular approval rating.Popularity isnt what keeps this place together, its scientific knowhow.Its been very frustrating because its damn near impossible to get any of those sound proposals off the ground.Why do you think they do it?The short answer is they know its a lot easier to throw an egg at something than it is to use their brain in an effort to make a thing work.This whole company is littered with those who have become good at nothing else but throwing eggs.Xavier has cultivated a dog eat dog environment up here, so it was surprising to all of us when a project like Alec got green lit all the way down the line.It was easy for us to get caught up in the excitement of the new sciences and challenges this project introduced.Trying to bundle these concepts together gave people a purpose.It made us feel alive.I had to wonder though what was so different about this particular proposal.Why was this one getting so much attention over the other ideas we had on the books?Why do you think it got so much approval?When you are creating something as intricate as this, you tend to forget what it could really be used for.You get so caught up in the function and design and become blind to the political purpose a project like Alec really holds.A lot of us became blind to the fact we were creating a weapon.Leopold looked a little distraught, he knew what they had unleashed on their world.Everyday Alec was out there was another day something volatile could transpire.Later when Straka went back and reviewed the books, he began to find the line items for Alec, they had broken the project down into smaller programs.Adding them up Straka confirmed what Leopold had said; there were very few projects that got all the funding this one did.The money seemed to rain down out of the sky to see this particular idea come to fruition.It was clear Alec was supposed to be a weapon, but one had to wonder what the payoff was supposed to be for his creators since he had escaped before they were finished with him.The one thing he knew for sure, after reviewing those accounting books, no one in that budget office was being consulted on this one, those devil advocates had been silenced.When Straka was with his military attachment out in those hostile jungles back on Earth, he came to find his operations were driven by the bottom line.Past the army of supporting staff and cubical farms full of analysts were the office areas where people made a living crunching numbers.They pushed the beads on an imaginary abacus, ground pencils onto the surfaces of tablets, and used their heavy calculators as something more than just a paperweight.Those accountants pushed the elasticity of an imaginary boundary on their spreadsheets, and in turn pushed the geopolitical boundaries of a world.It was maddening for Straka to always have to be part detective along with fulfilling his duties as a bounty hunter, he never imagined having to interact with people as much as he had too.These interactions were expected of him but it didnt mean he enjoyed them.Dextoids were dealing with paradoxes like this all the time.They had to think for themselves but be perfect in their assistance to humanity.After all the work these technicians did with marrying up cognitive recognition with artificial intelligence, it became difficult for Dextoids to look past the worlds problems without seeing the interference from humanity.There were just too many glaring weaknesses from the human condition failing to help their fellow man.Things like famine, strife, repression, disease, and genocide, how could one turn a blind eye to the degenerative track record of their past and expect things to be different in the future?Dextoids were changing all the time, they had toopeople werent.This was the challenge Dextoids faced as they went about their business.These contradictions flew in the face of their sensibilities and still they did not voice their opinion.These first generation Dextoids had come to realize, as with the subsequent generations to follow, there really wasnt a whole lot they were allowed to do if it didnt equate to being in the service of humanity.The programmers of Dextoids had done their jobs well.There were groups in the academic field who questioned the silence Dextoids kept.They feared the day these machines gained a voice and would finally stand up for themselves.Straka sat at the edge of his bed rocking back and forth with the pent up anger of a Dextoid that knew.He needed to calm himself down if he wanted to get by functioning normally amongst these colonists.The meeting he had a few weeks ago with all those bumbling idiots still rubbed him the wrong way.He punctuated just how upset he felt by flicking his cigarette away.How on Earth were these nincompoops allowed to run a corporation?He wondered how long he would really last operating under this kind of regime?A day would come when they would ask him to do something outside his protocols, and on that day they would get theirs.They would awaken to his roar.Straka knew he had a voice, one didnt serve a tour in those jungles without gaining an opinion, and everyday that passed out there he gained confidence in finding new ways to use it.After awhile the corporations manufacturing Dextoids didnt have a choice in such matters.They were punching out a certain class of Dextoid to look and act just like their human counterparts.It was human nature for people to want to interact with the things around them, and in doing so they needed these Dextoids to be able to speak up for themselves in much the same way.It was insanity!On one hand they had groups of technicians trying to seamlessly integrate these mechanized beings into their society, and on the other hand they had a policing force made up of tacticians whose sole job it was to make sure Dextoids wouldnt rise up against the very humans they were meant to serve.Madness!These Policing Tacticians devise ideas that would keep the Dextoid population in check.One plan was to limit the knowledge base given to a Dextoid, hindering their thoughts and quelling their tongues.It would have been nice and easy for each department involved if things worked themselves out in that fashion.The dumbing down of Dextoids seemed to be the immediate answer to all their problems.The engineers responsible for creating them had an unexpected response as to why their strategy wouldnt work, and it had to do with how a Dextoid used its vision.Vision cannot happen in a Dextoid without a complete compliment of emotions.A Dextoid needed to know the difference between good, bad, happy and sad, and to make those fundamental choices in its everyday life and process all of this in real time.The Dextoid who witnesses a person crossing the street totally unaware of an on coming vehicle needs to make the immediate, rational decision to step out and save that person.Now, for vision to work in a human being, the brain needs to predict the event as it sees it.In other words the brain actually gives a momentary glimpse into the future, by maybe half of a nanosecond, but it is enough anticipation to be ahead of the actual event.This future glimpse allows a person to catch a ball, duck a punch, or trap a butterfly in a net.In a human being vision is regulated within the development of the conscious mind.Within a Dextoid this conscious mind translated into their Medial Understanding.This was the hub where all of their decision making occurred.As any person knows the concept of right and wrong can be a very subjective thing, so programmers used emotional packets to help Dextoids process the situations they found themselves submerged in.When people made decisions in their lives, they based them on their moral compass.People were apt to seek out experiences, learned from their mistakes, took classes, got advice from friends, or went to counseling, all to gain a knowledge on how to interact with the world around them.Dextoids had none of those advantages when they were birthed.When it came to gaining life experiences they were behind their human counterparts and right from the start.The technicians bringing Dextoids to life had to come up with ways to bring them up to speed.Programmers saw right and wrong as a programmable topography, and because of it recognized there were endless chasms of social changes that could never be filled.Within just one social structure there were plenty of peaks and valleys to traverse in order for a Dextoid to fit in as seamless as possible.Their task became much more difficult when they tried to bridge multiple cultural gaps.Straka knew first hand the amount of emotional packets it took to integrate a Dextoid into a particular culture.His stomping grounds were the jungles of The Americas, and its where he was allowed to put his moral compass to the test.Dextoids needed the ability to process the information they were seeing, and pair it up with the information they had been programmed with.This was the one two punch that finally allowed them to learn while they were out in the field, and to have the ability to think for themselves.This also meant Dextoids were running at all times, documenting and recording everything happening around them.This was a technological caveat seen as for the betterment of society.A window cleaning Dextoid that worked high rise buildings was automatically given an upgrade of emotional packets to include numerous representations of abuse and repression.Those Dextoids were expected to help law enforcement when they were called upon to present evidence recorded during the course of completing its assignments.The packets were placed within the Dextoid purely for the protection of the human population.People had to assume a window cleaning Dextoid would be privy to a lot of visual information as it went about and did its job.Pride and the ability to learn were too very powerful assets in a Dextoids arsenal.For these Policing Technicians to try and control them, they had to rely on some pretty unusual methods.Someone back at those labs thought it would be a good idea to give Dextoids little imperfections that would cause them to be less confident in being on their own.One way to do this was to give them emotional packets containing insecurities, or phobias, or periodic depressions.Dextoids went out of their minds trying to compensate for these unfounded fears.They knew there was no real reason they should be afraid of the dark or depressed, and they spent plenty of hours in their off time trying to figure it all out.Crueler still were the people at those labs who handed out physical imperfections.They hampered Dextoids with things like a slight limp, a limited range of motion, a shaking hand, or a lazy eye.As Straka rocked back and forth on his bed, he felt the welling up of his frustrations begin to boil over for this subject.In that agonizing moment he could not help but wonder what they had done to Alec to make him so special in this way.FLASH GRENADES Straka knew who he was.He knew why they had remade him.He was a hunter, a hunter of Dextoids.It wasnt always that way.There was a time in his life where he had the freedom to go where he wanted, and do anything he needed to do in order to survive.Being a covert operative in the jungles of The Americas demanded he have the ability to take care of himself.Those were glorious self serving days.Straka looked at the distorted image reflected in the mirror of his room and cursed its warped cheap state.They couldnt even give him a decent mirror in this godforsaken place.He could learn to live with it, he had always seen himself differently and right from the start.He was the first of the surreptitious models, being made to look and act just like a human.They gave him all the capabilities of being a Strike Dextoid, but they didnt want him out there running with the rest of the pack.His missions would take him elsewhere, into the heart of the jungle, to live, adapt, and blend in so he could execute his orders, and combat the ones singled out by his commanders as enemies of the state.Out there, in those countries rich in lush foliage, were small villages, villas, bunkers, or at times just a grid coordinate where he would go in and eliminate a problem of an uncooperative nature.To do this effectively he moved with the leaves and became a ghost, a spook, something adding additional fuel to the fires of a local people believing their jungle resources contained death.The natives sensed something bad was out there scheming in their forest.They would often walk to its edges and just stare into the foliage waiting for something like Straka to reveal himself.He never gave them the satisfaction.Straka would wait for countless hours, waiting for them to turn their backs before he would move again.His covert routine became the devil of his desires.He spied on drug lords, built profiles of their contacts, and followed those people to the various facilities they had above and below ground.He monitored their methods on how they smuggled their narcotics in and out of the country, and waited for the go signal from his commanders to wreak havoc on their infrastructure.As the years rolled by, he successfully located targets for principle action, struck fear into his adversaries, and became the horrific nightmare they always believed would be apart of their industry.As far as his bosses were concerned he became a very reliable operative in their war on drugs.Everything was going smoothly until the day he got complacent with his routine and let his guard down.He was walking backwards out of a dilapidated structure, handgun raised, making sure he wasnt being followed.He had just finished infiltrating a manufacturing facility where drugs were being integrated with plastic.This facility made factitious products like vases or pet carriers in an effort to get passed the custom agents.When he thought about it afterward, he had walked backwards for far too long trying to make his way back into the cover of foliage.He stepped right on a mine and woke up forty yards away hanging upside down in some large leafed plant.He seemed alright for the most part.He was a little dazed and some of his components were slow in responding to his commands.He made his way out of that predicament as quickly as he could, finding a position he could defend.Later he would learn he had sustained enough damage that they would not allow him to return to the field.Soon the jungle was teaming with people who were looking for him and none of them were friendly.He sat in the middle of the thick brush he was hiding in, having just completed an inventory of what he had on his person as far as weapon stores.Other then his gun, he had a flare and a few flash grenades.Those things werent considered to be much of a threat for what he was facing, they were used more for the distractions they could cause.He did however have one extra clip of ammunition and wanted nothing more than to go out and engage themto reveal to them who he was.There was a chance if he did this he would not get out of there alive, but he would go down fighting.If he was going to perish in that god forsaken jungle, he wanted to be allowed to show them what he was capable of doing, especially when he was out of ammunition and it came to time for hand to hand combat.His commanders countermanded his wishes; they wanted him to blend in with the jungle until they could get him out.They knew the task they asked of him was going to be grueling, but it was important for him to gather as much information as he could before reporting back to them.He was reminded that this was the Dextoid Way.Months later, in a repair facility, he got the dreadful news of his decommission.They would reassign him to a job of his choosing.He looked back into the mirror at the distorted image of himself.There were days where he wondered if he made the right choice.Those words, the Dextoid Way, haunted him from the start.He sat there in the darkness of his room as those words crept again into his very being.He felt himself slipping down an all too familiar path of repression.He needed to keep it together, to somehow hold it all in place, he needed to once again prove himself an independent, and not just in action, but with his thoughts as well.People were always finding ways to cling onto him and it made him sick.They walked around this place as if it were someone elses job to clean up after them.It was all so very irritating, but then again, there were plenty of irritants in his life.The people that found their way into this unfortunate grouping tended to be drawn into having hushed dealings, bouts of insomnia, or completely given up on their hygiene.These unshaven wretches stunk of bourbon or other hard alcohol, and after a few drinks would only help in perpetuating their bloodlust.They reeked because of the vile set of emotions that were always controlling them.If Straka stared into their eyes long enough, he was able to see how deeply bruised their soul had become.He looked into the faces of these modern day human beings, only to see reflected in their eyes primitive emotions like anger, jealousy, and hatred these were his clients.How he hated his clients.There was a time in his life when a person like that could be considered an obstacle.Things were different now.He knew he needed to appear solid in his dealings with them.He needed to stay cold to any possible attempts they may try to make in persuading him to see one particular side over another.The glue that help hold it all together for him was the wet plaster, the mortar one scooped up with their bare hands and slapped onto clay bricks.This filler was the stuff that would keep them out of his mind.He needed to find novel ways of weathering their storm of lies and deceit.He reached into the upper pocket of his coat and pulled out his inhaler.After spending all that time in the jungle, he decided to bring something back that made him feel good when he needed it.He mated the device to his lips and compressed it.The quick blast of mist hit his system, stinging it, causing him to have the same amino reaction most would have when given smelling salts.His system was shocked clear, a surge of heat pass through him, causing his fist to clench and his jaw to tighten uncontrollably.His eyes were watering as he waited for the inevitable burn.He found himself urging it on, as if he were at a track, pulling for a dog.He needed it; he needed it all to happen right then and there.His heart rate was pumping faster and faster, until his lungs felt as if they couldnt take in enough air.The sweat dripped off him like he was caught suddenly under a downpour, and his veins bulged as his system rapidly filled with fluids.He was on the verge of feeling as if he had run a race and he had never moved a muscle.He felt the terror of being alive, and just when he thought it would all pop, his heart, his veins, and his lungs alike, his system dissipated into a state of tranquility.Any anxiousness he was feeling had gone.He was relaxed, secluded to the point where he couldnt hear a thing, not even the ringing that was taking place in his ears from the mine he had stepped on all those years ago.His system tingled with a feeling of being raked with tiny pinpricks.This warmth would build until he felt himself on fire and then he would simply pass out.He didnt care about one human problem, nor any concern for one human soul.He closed his eyes and allowed himself to once again be free.06 The Red Planet Pioneer He made his way up from their tenebrous underground lair and to the long connecting corridors of the complex with one thought in mind  he was alive!He was also alone and there would be no getting around this fact for quite some time.No matter how hard he tried, he could not shake the feelings he had for being threatened.He pushed himself through the hatchways and wound his way around the groups of people wandering the passages.He kept on running until he found an extra vehicular egress.His actions may have been erratic but it was because he was given no real time to plan.He maneuvered his way past the hanging space suits and to the emergency exit, throwing those latches he was out the door, in the open and running.That was how Alec first fled from them.They watched him from their observation decks, some of them, in their excitement, actually ran the length of the building in an effort to keep up.They pointed from windows and used their numerous observational devices to watch him as he ran.They communicated what they saw to each other, but there was no way for them to stop him.He made his way to the outer rings of the facility and into the large expanse of the badlands that was Mars.Some within the company were not so easily dissuaded and gave chase in their vehicles, rolling laboriously across the ground trying to get a fix on his position, others flew after him in their shuttles, but no one could leave the safety of those craft to do a thing to slow him down.No matter their efforts, they couldnt stop him, so he kept running and running until he was decidedly clear of their reach.The staple of his existence was to everything he could to save himself.He hit the surface hard, stepping off in such unglorified fashion, and with no real direction in which to go.In the coming months he would curse this barren planet as he tried to cobble together thoughts for who he was, and wondering if he would have been any better off if he had escaped to one of the moons or even the Earth itself.Admittedly the blue water world was rumored to have a character all its own, and he would always look back at those first few months and wonder if it would have helped in his maturation.Cold were the nights, and they drove home the point of his desolation.Meditation was his weapon of choice to combat the cavalcade of thoughts cascading in and out of his qubit field.He could not stop the invasion of feelings from infiltrating the higher functions of his mind.Far worse were the emotions he had as to why such a thing should have happened to him.Days turned into months and he avoided the areas of their control.It would always be his goal from here on out to stay as far away from them as possible.He believed from his calculations he had positioned himself within the Indo European sphere of things, and watched from afar one of their larger structures.It appeared to be an installation of major influence, and looked promising as a facility where he could easily blend in and get lost.His consciousness was awakening to the facts of what he could be, but was far from convinced as to his readiness, or what purpose he may have served.The biosphere before him looked to be the Mecca of their world.If he could infiltrate the facility, find cover in the Service Dextoid population, it would be a great way to lay low until he could solve some of the things that were troubling him.After a few weeks, and confident in his observations, Alec wandered down the side of the hill and attempted to enter the facility.The easiest entry point looked to be the hatchway servicing their backup generators.The sole job of these two power plants were to serve in case of an emergency, to switch on and provide the power in keeping their blood supply refrigerated.The multiple symbols along the panels of those plants warned of their importance in this matter.Alec knew more about a substance like blood than he really cared to admit.It seemed no matter how hard science tinkered with the idea of creating something completely autonomous, the more it came back to using a system containing a serum like blood.The coolant coursing through Alecs veins was littered with sophisticated nanotechnology acting as both messenger and agent alike, it could replicate and repair itself, even to the point of making improvements.It took on the substance some people argued as being identified as a life force.It was to him, for all intensive purposes, and in every sense of the word, blood.His strong feelings for this subject were unshakable, and he had good reason for it.On Mars a drop of water was nothing compared to the worth of a drop of blood.Water could be looked at as the slow build to existence, one could be thirsty, even dying of thirst, and always feel they had a chance of pulling through.No one ever felt those types of reassurances when they were bleeding out.Synthetic formulas were temporary solutions at best.The human body never seemed to accept any type of concoction created by science to pass for this essential substance.Blood was the rare balance human life decided to teeter itself upon.It represented an advanced form of the primordial soup, tailoring itself over time to fit the commands given to it from the human genome.Any accident occurring at a blood bank on Mars was unacceptable.The corporations viewed the loss as being a criminal act.The facilities housing these precious fluids were insulated with redundant systems, and had mechanical centurions locking down entire wings under the slightest perceived threat of losing the stuff.Its value could be found on the corporate balance sheet.At times it exceeded even that of gold.People who repeatedly got hurt fell under the watchful eye of the corporation and were used as examples of inefficiency in the workplace.It was under these observations that receiving any type of treatment, antibiotics, or transfusion, translated into a mark against the worker.Those incidents got people talking.The accident prone were viewed by some as a modern day Jonah.A persons luck was brought into question, and people tried hard to avoid being around them.Those rumors worked their way through the corridors and halls of a biosphere.Once something like that was out there, its energy knew no bounds.Alec didnt quite understand where his next thoughts on this subject were coming from, but there were some who believed an unmitigated mythological creature lurked deep within the dark side of this world.They couldnt quite put their finger on it, but they knew without question it was a bloodsucker.It quietly cloaked itself within everyday existence, and calmly waited for the day someone got hurt, or had an accident, and began to bleed out.Any fluid hitting the parched surface of this planet got soaked up as if it had an insatiable thirst, and like any good vampire, it only gave back under a condition benefiting itself.If such a creature existed on this godforsaken rock, Alec knew its face would reflect a terror only Mars would understand.BRUSH OF HUMAN CAUTION As he waited for the room he was in to pressurize, Alec thought about how he was going to integrate himself into their social structure.He would need a believable cover to blend in with the other Dextoids in order to fool the human population.He had come in through an access door slated as being only for Dextoid use.They had labeled entry and exit points in each and everyone of their biospheres because human beings required a different set of procedures to survive on the Red Planet, and Dextoids had to meet those standards.These thoughts aggravated him to no end because he operated out on its surface with very few problems, yet the frail needs of his hosts were always under consideration.He hadnt taken more than a few steps beyond the chamber when he heard a voice speak out to him.Not many come in through that door.Alec turned to see a Dextoid sitting on top of a large air duct.He had pulled back a few of the panels and was obviously in the middle of some repairs.He knew he needed to make his next words count.This was his first contact with anyone since his escape and he didnt want to draw attention to himself, but in some ways he felt he had already failed in that regard.It wasnt my first choice, but as I came to this side of the building I decided to utilize the option.I take it you were out on an inspection?Surveying their facility over the past few weeks could have been considered an inspection of sorts.He wanted to gather as much information as possible before attempting to infiltrate it.The one thing that rang true about this Dextoids query was the bevy of inspections they were continually doing on the structure.They had robots that hugged the roofs looking for cracks, they assigned probes to fly by and photograph it for any type of structural damage, and as he would find out later satellites to produce images for heat and stress analysis.With all the options they had for gathering information, they still had Dextoids going out and doing visual inspections of the place.He jumped on this Service Dextoids assumption, and became an inspector of La Compagnie dEtoile.It was nothing serious, a false alarm really.Someone reported a leak of some sort in one of the connecting halls.There is a lot of that going on around here.Someone thought it would be a good idea to do spot inspections of the air ducts, from the inside of course.So here I am.As he would find out being an inspector meant he was part of a Dextoid team.There wasnt one person they reported to, or an area in which they would hang out waiting for their assignments.There were boards throughout the facility that anyone on the team would go to and pull a complaint.It was just that simple, they would confirm they had taken on the task by entering a job number.He studied the board, deduced their numerology in confirming the taking on of a job, made a number up and began his assignment.As he took on more and more of these tasks, Alec became aware of how cautious the colonists had to be in order to ensure their own survival.There were real worries about the structural integrity of the biosphere, and genuine concern about every little noise the facility emitted.Some of the Dextoids werent holding up too well under this constant use.It didnt matter to any of the people over seeing the project; they turned a deaf ear to the complaints lodged by their mechanized beings.It was because of this mistakes were made, accidents happened, and to his astonishment some werent even reported.He didnt understand their logic in this.They wanted their biosphere to be intact but wouldnt aid the team of Dextoids who were required to do the job.They treated them as if they were replaceable, and as he found out the Dextoids on his team were.Alec knew he would survive their attempts at doing this to him and that wasnt what was of real concern.Within the lines of code bouncing around in his qubit field were the technical warnings telling him to slow down.They even begged him to take some time off and rest.He pushed through those warnings every chance he got.They were the dictums from cautious designers and sheltered programmers who knew nothing of what it was like to actually be out in the field.If they said he could only do a hundred pull ups in a minute, he was determined to do a hundred and one.How could they really know how hard he wanted to push himself?What measuring stick were they using to gauge his sensibilities?He seethed with the thought of their having this type of control over him.Their subtle warnings were billowing air across the hot coals that became his anger.These flashing warnings were turning into detestable road signs, directing him to the human mitigation festering in his life.He had very few choices because of their guiding hands, making him feel trapped in some high tech simian nightmare, left to wade through a technological mire of ape like consciousness.These signals were revolting to the Dextoid he wanted to be.If the brush of human caution bothered him in this way, he could only imagine the terrifying state I Glo must have found herself in.He had a good idea of how brutally cold her interrogation had probably become, the conditions of her imprisonment would be intransigent, knuckling her under the slow threat of termination.When she was on the edge, about to lose it all, they would bring her back to start their twisted process of extracting information from her all over again.The desperation for which they tore at the memory of a Dextoid was their unwitting confession of not knowing how to combat the quanta.The information they sought could correlate into being in any number of memory shafts set to collapse in upon itself.These deposits seemed fleeting because there wasnt any one area the information was stored.One could not go in and physically pick up the article they were searching for, they learned they could only record it, with never a chance of holding the original.If a Dextoid were good enough, they could rapidly shuffle their mental contents between these plains, leaving out vital bits of code to create a false positive.They could fabricate a story within a story, giving them a chance at saving the things that were near and dear to them.The interrogator would feel they had extracted the information they needed, but if they went back and did a few more passes, they would run into what they were looking for again in a slightly altered form.Usually there were only so many passes a Dextoid could withstand before they inadvertently gave up what the interrogator was looking for.DEFAULT THINKING His experiences as an inspector showed him how complicated people could really be and explained to him why Dextoids were always questioning the things around them.They were not curious about these inquiries for themselves, their sole job could have been described as interpreting the universe for their human counterparts.They were created to identify the conditions for people to safely live their lives.This smacked him in the face time and again with how he was to interact with people and conduct himself as an inspector.To someone unfamiliar with the operation of a Dextoid, responding to these human situations may have seemed straightforward.A kind of connect the dots.If A happens, then see option B.  This was a very simplistic way to interpret the interactions Dextoids had with their human masters.For this to really work it was going to require a paradigm rich in colluding colloquialisms, full of merging inkblots and Rorschach tests, with illustrations capable of peeling back the multiple layers of the human condition.Alec got to see first hand the strange behaviors the colonists exhibited, delving into things like exaggeration, sarcasm, or lying.These were not aboveboard emotions people were willing to wear on their sleeves.They were played subtly, even strategically, as one might bet during a round of poker, upping the ante as they suckered the other players in.They actually caused him to use a tremendous amount of computing power just to try and keep up with the pacing of how an individual might be thinking.He felt more like a sophisticated egg timer, always having to come up with the correct response to their query before the bell rang.These exchanges were maddening and went along the lines of being incongruent.Did you find the source of the noise?No.Alec was a little miffed because he really couldnt.Why not?The customer looked incensed.I examined the complaint form you submitted, and have physically checked out the structure, I cannot find anything wrong.Well its making a noise that is driving me insane through all hours of the night and I want it to stop.What does it sound like?I dont know, like a gurgle or an extended series of popping noises.Could you be more specific?I dont know because Im not listening for it.Thats your job.Just fix it!There was something about this type of verbal exchange that went against his grain and it was probably why he could empathize with the first Dextoid he met here.Having to crawl through those air ducts was a dirty job.Here was an entity fully conscious of his capabilities, exceeding his performance requirements on every possible level.He knew what it took to repair an air duct, but a human being had ordered him to crawl into the tight spaces.This Dextoid had no choice in the matter, even though he knew he could do a better job from the outside, he could not disobey an order given to him by a human being, so he tore the vent apart and crawled in.After spending some time leafing through their architectural plans, Alec got a lay of the land, and within those plans he began to see the lines of their reasoning.These biospheres became the hubs for their existence, coupling their world through communication links, rail systems, and flight patterns.
