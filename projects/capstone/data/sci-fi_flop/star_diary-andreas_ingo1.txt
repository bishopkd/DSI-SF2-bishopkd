  Nimrod 3, the light gray working machine, with outstretched arms, twelve feet long and five feet wide, moved majestically over the chlorophyll rich grass.It was a futuristic model, built in pieces.There was a drivers seat, where you could see the driver Mandal Ascension, imprisoned under an arched pane of glass.He gazed dreamily out on the workplace, where the machine's rotary tool equipped with knife edges, got the grass to rave under high pressure.That was on the mini planet Aquatica, some highly paid colony reformers wet dream.A sphere shaped structure that measured five hundred meters in diameter: Composed of eight smaller parts, which divided the globe in a section in the middle, and two cuts in each of the two halves that built the body of the globe.It hovered in a geostationary orbit around the sea dominated planet Aqua 6: A celestial body that was half as big as Earth, and located in a solar system fifty light years away.The day had come and the variable sun, which almost always shone with a hint of blue, was able to give life to the paradise like surroundings on Aquatica.It was a park like swagger build, where colonial reformers invited guests and seduced many women.When Mandal Ascension traveled across the lawns, it was like he lost perspective on time and space.He was completely up in the role as the cosmic caretaker.Alone, with no time to spend on entertainment and other diversions, he was only faced with the task: to nurture and develop the beauty of the amazing plants that thrived on the mini planet.The working machine Nimrod 3 was not only meant for bigger jobs.It had internal space in an upper level where there was a connection device.Here Mandal used two remote controlled robots.These were mounted on the front of the machine, in cavities.These resembled graves of the dead, designs in lightweight metal.The robots would rise from the cavities when they were revitalized by Mandals consciousness.In the lower level there were Mandals office, his sleeping area, shower and toilet.The day turned to afternoon when Mandal was finished with the overall workload.He stopped the working machine, looked out at the blue silhouette of Aqua 6, which rose above the oval horizon like a giant dome.There were islands in the blue sea.These had the color of golden brown, structures in light gray also marked futuristic cities.Mandal went down from the cockpit.He used the precision cut aluminum ladder, a work of automated factories.The upper floor of Nimrod 3 was a room for a traveler on a journey between two worlds: The inner world of Nimrod 3, with the sparse furnished interior, polished and fresh smelling, and the external world in the well kept park.He sat down in the inclined link chair, molded as a futuristic statue with a seat of polished leather, lowered the connection link and activated.The robot awoke from its unconscious slumber.Mandal tested the coordination of the gleaming arms.These had the color of aluminum, not mounted in a piece, but consisting of three tubes with joints.The hands could be replaced with different tools.There was a cutting tool for processing plants, a marvel of metal with sharp edges.Additionally, there was a spreader from an earlier century, a spreader that could be connected to a water supply, laced with nutrition.The robot stood up, used a ladder and stepped down on the grass.It went out over the precision cut grass, descended on the artificial ground and inspected the day's work.The grass was still alive, just as green and full of chlorophyll as usual.The length of the grass measured three centimeters.None of this surprised Mandal.He proceeded towards the perimeter of the lawn.Here bright green plants were seen, high as ferns, arranged in an artistic way.There were red trees also, at times, like palm trees with elongated leaves.The green plants reminded of Aloe Plants.Light yellow portions, like folded wings of dragons, appeared on the curled leaves.The red palm trees were even more beautiful.They leaned, as a doomed lover at gate of his future wife.Darker grains appeared on the leaves and in some areas red tinted to violet.The robot went over the artificial surface of the planet.Gravitation was generated from a special apparatus in the planet's center, it was working satisfactory and the walk was normal.The robot came to a small pond that was near a domed hill.A boardwalk was leading out to the center of the pond; this was a small island, dug in precision for maximum affect value.The surface of the water didnt ripple but reflected the silhouette of Aqua 6.There was a small gazebo on the island.This was built with futuristic dimensions: Windows similar to square triangles, outer expansions that formed patterns completely impractical but sensuous to the eye.It was an upper ring at the gazebo, which formed a semi circle overlooking the lake.Mandal opened a door and walked into the gazebo.He went up to a vase that stood on a table and inspected the plant in the vase.It was a yellow plant, similar to a rose, with pink outgrowths.The outgrowths formed tentacle like waveforms in the afternoon light and seemed almost to move when touched.Mandal noticed that the plant needed water.He lifted the plant out of the vase, took the vase to the pond and filled it with water, and then put the plant in the vase again.The rest of the day passed in a haze of work and full absorption.Mandal inspected everything he could in the park.Sometimes he changed one plant to another: Watered a little with the spreader, pruning overgrown trees with the cutting tool, then he dug into the earth with the hand.Finally, he got tired and was ready for bed.The sleeping alcove was like made for a little man.Mandal was born with a rich genetic inheritance, but was still very pale in the face.The face was different.It was narrower, more pointed.The eyes were larger and darker.The wrinkles that formed faint insinuations around the eyes, nose and mouth, made the man feel alive.His face was like something forgotten and old yet new.A hint of the animal kingdom, but mechanized, a mix between the androids from the twenty first century and the cats from the past.When he lay down on his side, and looked into the study, he was really happy.The workroom was full of seedlings in all manner of colors, and the walls were decorated with shining posters.The sheet was colored in silver; it was soft as silk, cool and caressed his body.Soon, he fell asleep.* * *      The following day faded into the variable light from the star.Mandals aide wandered over the mini planets surface and inspected the plants at the South Pole.Going over the equator, continuing three hundred meters over the sphere and end up in a new angle, was an experience beyond time and space: The blue light from the sea, which reflected the light of the variable, was like fading reality on a new frequency.Mandal was at the South Pole and continued forward, the blue light faded away and was replaced by a silent emptiness, not inky darkness, rather dusk.He noticed that the lights had been lit.It was red and blue lights that threw showers of photons against a jungle of plants, fenced.A walking path of stone slabs was prepared by architectural masters, Mandal made small adjustments.Suddenly he stopped.At a particular location, on the edge of the decorative jungle, a section of cobblestones was knocked aside.In sheer terror Mandal watched his greatest fear: Someone had torn up trees and bushes of the ground, raked and left nothing on the spot.The section was not ugly in any sense: The whole spot was a perpendicular surface, not a blade of grass was left.The soil was raked almost mechanically, with precision by an intruder who must have had the same profession.Mandal wondered if this was an ordered job.Someone must have arrived during the night and made a planned intervention.Perhaps the colonial reformers had a new wish and hired someone who did the job?
