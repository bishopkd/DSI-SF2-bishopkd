We are a split and splintered species.Every pivot point of need and creed proves the ease with which we fracture; every heartfelt reunion warns against its own necessity.The lines of our division are as many and varied as the sins of our ancestors and the accidents of history; as varied as the lines on the palm of Mikal Varsis hand, double thumbed and huge at the end of a three foot long arm, as he raises it and takes the oath.His eyes, split lidded like a lizards, blink slowly as he listens to the solemn proclamation of the clerk, stumbling over her words a little as she gazes up and up to his face, wondering as she does so if her tiny part in this moment will be remembered; and wondering also, fleetingly and with guilt, whether posterity will smile upon the memory or revile her for it.Then he opens his mouth, an ordinary mouth, a mouth she has already learned is no less quick with smiles than with wit, and in a gentle, nasal voice repeats after her just as he should, and she thinks, Well that wasnt so bad.She turns to set aside the edicts he has sworn to uphold, and he turns aside to the woman who stands behind him, a woman whose height and hands and eyes are steadfastly normal and who would, moreover, tell you that her heart is too; though there are still many who think this unlikely, for she has given both it and her name to a gem, a man designed for service and built for labor.He bends now and the long arm wraps around her body, and the thumbs on either side of that well lined palm squeeze her shoulder as she tips her head back to smile up at him and receive his kiss.There is applause from his fellow councillors and hearty laughter all around the chamber, but the clerk thinks she sees a hint of her own secret worry flit across more than a few faces.And then he steps off the platform, eight towering feet of genetically modified humanity moving to take its place for the first time among the elect of the city; and they part for him like a sea, and like the sea close behind him once again.Aryel Morningstar watched until Mikal had settled into his seat at the horseshoe shaped council table from which London had been governed since the dawn of what had then been called the twenty first century.The era had since been relegated, with distaste and a considerable suggestion of blame, to the third decade BSBefore Syndrome, the last generation to precede catastrophe.She often mused on how little had changed since then, and how much.When the formal welcomes concluded without incident and they moved on to the tedium of minutes and motions she flicked her tablet to standby and stepped out of the columns shadow, enjoying the midmorning warmth that radiated off the ancient stone of the cathedral.She was high up, standing on the circular balcony that ringed the dome, a place normally inaccessible to all but the few ecclesiastical staff members who remained.Had any other gem, or norm for that matter, reached it unchallenged, the consternation and embarrassment of the custodians would have been intense.That the rules did not apply to heranywhere really, but especially not herewas a fact acknowledged at so base and basic a level that formal confirmation was neither necessary nor expected.Her gaze slipped idly past the discreetly placed and probably derelict security vidcam, grateful for this stolen moment of sunlit quiet.The low hum of the streets drifted up to her, but her view was fixed on the river, old Father Thames rolling slow, slate gray and imperturbable.Her eyes, eagle sharp and attuned to movement, caught the ripple and a flash of green as a pair of gillungs broke the surface, got their bearings, and submerged again.Visitors probably, in town for the Festival.She had much to do herself, and could expect it all to take far longer than was strictly speaking necessary, given the added responsibilities of profile.But Mikals ascension to the city council was a milestone that deserved to be marked, a victory that would have been unthinkable not that many years before and a validation that still bathed the residents of the Squats in a slightly stunned satisfaction.She had worked as hard for it as any of them, and with the added complication of fending off suggestions that the candidate should instead have been her.She knew better, as did Mikal himself.Its not that I want to be in the spotlight, hed said.But it cant only be you, all of the time.We need to really test how things are for the rest of us, and we need someone who can be a bellwether.Now I tick all their boxes for outsize, ugly, scary looking gem, and they know I came up under the gemtechs.But the point is, they do know me.My abilities arent mysterious, they know I was a factory model.They know my cognition and mannerisms fall within the standard range, they know Ive got experience running a community, they know Im married.To a norm cop.I know they know.And they havent been kind about it so far.Do you and Sharon really want to put yourselves through that again?Because youd be perfect, Mik, but what it would do to you.What it would do to us its already done.And were still standing.So it had been decided, and the campaign proved as bruising as she had predicted.Scrupulously proper public discourse had been leavened with whispered, withering, back alley nastiness.The vitriol leveled at Sharon Varsi was muted and reduced this time, but no less vicious.She had rolled her eyes, set her jaw, and stood up to it with a fortitude that made Aryels eyes prickle.It was Eli Walker, carefully monitoring the tides of opinion on the streams, who first observed that he thought the naysayers had overreached, tipped the balance of acceptability and triggered instead a groundswell of opprobrium.It was a phenomenon theyd seen before.He looked keenly at her as he said it, as though expecting her to declare herself unsurprised.She was indeed less so than the others, but they were still all astonished when he won.Now she considered the impact of those few minutes in the council chamber on the people they represented, and thought about what it must mean to Mikal himself, only a few years emancipated; and to Sharon.It was nearby, no more than a couple of minutes flight across the river and downstream, and she could have been there to share the moment with them.But then she would have been unable to prevent the inevitable shift of focus from Mikal to herself.So she had stayed away, allowing Mik to shine without the competition of her own strange and omnipresent spotlight.If there had been any subtleties of reaction in the chamber shed missed them; but her presence would have skewed the responses anyway.So much that happened now had become so difficult for her to see.Eli had been there.She would ask him later what he thought.She slipped the tablet into its squeeze pocket on her thigh and grabbed hold of the stone balustrade, stepping into a chink in its richly carved surface and levering herself up.Her other foot found the top of the rail, and she balanced easily there for a moment.Sunlight glinted off bright bronze colored feathers as the first shouts came up from below.She spread her wings and leaned forward, falling into the wind, and angled to follow the gillungs up the river.Further downstream, another woman also watched and pondered the significance of the mornings events.She too had been less surprised than many, although she had both amused and startled herself with the surge of reflexive envy shed felt that the first gem to attain such status had been the product of a competitor.Such distinctions hardly mattered anymore.More important was the impact on her own intentions, and she considered the matter carefully.On the face of it Mikal Varsi, n Recombin, should have little bearing on her plans, but shed been wrong about such things before.She rose from her desk, an elegantly sculptural piece made of wood engineered to grow in precisely the flowing, convoluted shapes that would render it both beautiful and functional, and walked over to the gently curving window that formed the back wall of her office.Her view was vast, towers of steel and turrets of stone and glass pinnacles stretching away in every direction.She caught a glimpse of the river between them, and a glint off the dome of the cathedral.Like everyone else in the city, she scanned the skies.She had seen many changes in her life, a life longer than most would guess.But there was something in this latest shift, in the election of Mikal Varsi and the insouciance of the gillungs and above all the flight of Aryel Morningstar, that felt indelible; less like a period to be weathered than one which heralded the beginning of an age.Her compatriots in the once monolithic gemtech world generally still decried it as a disgrace, or prophesied its derailment, or continued merely to wallow in a bewildered depression.She had worked hard to curb her own resentment and rethink the situation in terms of opportunity.She knew that a large part of what drove her on, what kept her focused and sharp, was the anger and excitement and bitterness she felt every time the winged woman soared over the city.Aryel Morningstar could notshould notexist.All the manipulations of the human genome, even the most radical, had resulted only in variations on the basic mammalian body typefour limbs not six, except in those few dreadful cases where mistake or accident had replicated an existing pair to painful and useless effect.All the careful, clever splicing of the DNA of other species had been subtle, incorporating new attributes into extant body parts: hyperspectral eyesight, oxygen exchange in an aquatic environment, organ regeneration.Crafting wings greater than any bird had ever borne to spring from human shoulders, in a delicate, complicated double ball joint that existed nowhere in nature, was simply not possible.Yet it had been done, and in the doing, proved so many other certainties false.A soft chime sounded, directionless, and roused her from her brooding.Yes?The voice that responded was diffident, the undertone of apology for the interruption plain to hear.The latest status reports just come in, maam.From the new project?You said you wanted to know right away.Post it to my private stream.Immediately.Yes, Ms.Klist.Its been done.She was already back at the desk, activating the holoscreen.After a beat that was just a second too long to signify close attention, as an afterthought, she said, Thank you.The unseen assistant knew better than to reply.Binary        Awakening It is a noise that comes back to her even now, in moments of fear or confusion, or sometimes in the instant of waking.She is never certain, then, if it is the lingering echo of a dream, or the grip of unguarded memory, or the memory perhaps of a dream dreamed long ago and never entirely shaken.It is a sound like the sea, a regular, implacable surge before the hissing retreat through shingle, incessant and foreboding.With that rushing, metronomic threat comes a waft of cold, the chill of bare skin dusted by a light draft that smells of nothing; an empty, antiseptic cleanness.At some distance she cannot measure, over the steady bellows sound of the surf, a baby begins to wail.There is light, finally, and the surprise of not having noticed its absence; but it is no more than a dull fog of blurred shapes that refuse definition.It adds little to her understanding.She wishes for somethingwarmth perhaps, or comfortand another shadow flails feebly in the dimness before her.She thinks later that it might be her own hand.It slides out of her vision and she feels it subside onto the thinly cushioned surface upon which she lies.She cannot tell whether the failure of illumination is due to a weakness in the light itself, or that it falls upon eyes that cannot yet see.Binary       2 Eli was stopped twice on his way out of the venerable, bulbous city council building; once by a blushing sociology student with color streaked hair stammering out her admiration, and again by a newstream vidcam crew looking for a learned sound bite on the latest entry to the citys political pantheon.When they realized he was accompanied by Sharon Varsi, trailing a little behind as she finished listening to messages on her earset, they abandoned him practically in midsentence.He shrugged, cocked an eyebrow and a grin at her over their shoulders, and escaped outside.The riverwalk was buzzing with activity.He leaned against the guardrail, watching a group of gillungs and norms on a nearby pier as they signaled to a small tender that was helping to position an airwalk circuit.The inflated corridor began as a platform at the end of the pier, before it sloped gently away to become the entrance to a tunnel that projected out into the channel.He could see the buoys that marked its progress as it curved away upriver.Some crucial decision made, the tender stood off as the water breathing gems slipped into the river, submerging to swim out to an anchor point while their norm compatriots paralleled their progress from inside the airwalk.He quickly lost sight of the gillungs shimmering lime green hair in the bright sunshine glinting off the waters surface, and turned around to look for Sharon.She emerged from behind the curved glass of the building and hurried over to him.Sorry about that.Fine by me.Were they all right?Oh yeah.Sweet as one of Bals plum pies.Everyones being just wonderful, now.She sighed and shook her head, leaning on the rail beside him.Thats not fair of me, really.UrbanNews is always pretty okay.Unlike some of the others.Mmm.She was distracted, staring out at the airwalk.I thought this wouldve been ready by now.Its bigger than I expected.Mik told me they want to showcase more than just the technologytheyve expanded the original design so as you move further beneath the surface theres room for them to demonstrate all the different kinds of things theyre starting to do, beyond just farming and fishing and foraging.He says the gillungs want it to be an immersive experience.Pun very much intended, of course.Eli laughed.Mikals fondness for wordplay, already well known to his friends, had proved a surprising hit in the campaign.How is he today?Really?Really?Hes fine.You know Mik.Taking it in stride.Theres nothing they can throw at him in terms of council business that he wont be able to handle, not after five years running the Squats.As for the rest of it She shrugged.He only really gets pissed off when they come after me.Everything else washes right off him.Hes had to put up with worse than a few Reversionists being nasty to us on the streams.Eli nodded, although privately he thought that they remained more than a few; and suspected that Sharon thought so too.Outright opposition to the desegregation of gems had largely faded away, drowned out by horror and remorse in the wake of the fundamentalist violence that first brought both her and Mikal to public notice.Archive vids of the no nonsense police sergeant and the giant gem, desperately trying to help survivors and impose order in the chaotic aftermath of the worst such attack, were reposted with new rounds of heated commentary every time their union was criticized, or doubts raised about the wisdom of the new world order.The memory of those events kept even the more extreme Reversionists permanently in defensive mode.And yet their numbers appeared to shrink only slowly, if at all.It seemed to Eli that in an era of such turbulence, their call for a return to traditional values and ways of life had found a resonance unrelated to logic.He and Sharon strolled along the riverwalk, sidestepping other last minute preparations as they headed toward the station.She glanced back as they passed workers making adjustments to a holo display, a shape shifting cluster of light sculptures that swirled out Festival factoids, the images and text married to sound that insinuated itself softly into the earsets of those walking by.They caught a fragment of the list of events that formed part of the evenings launch as the field radius was widened.Im still not sure what I think about this.The holo?No, the whole thing.A Festival of the Future.It sounds sort of...presumptuous.Eli chuckled.Tempting fate, maybe?Maybe.Its just, you know.We may have come a long way in the last three or four years but its not like were in some state of perfect harmony and can go skipping off into the sunset.Things are tough still.I should know.She shook her head.I dont know what it is were supposed to be celebrating, exactly.Possibility, I think.And the idea that events are being driven by a sense of vision, that it isnt all just random.They clattered down the stairs into the ancient Underground station.There was a fashion for a while in something similar, a couple or three centuries back.They called them worlds fairs, sort of international trade bazaars, where all the countries got together to show off how sophisticated and forward thinking they were.Sharon snorted.Yeah, well.They didnt know then where it was all heading.But the point is they were consciously trying to focus on the future.To anticipate what was to come, instead of just reflecting on what had already happened.They may have gotten it wrong but I can understand the motivation.The government feels like they need to do something to push us into a next phase.Think itll work?Who knows?They paused at a junction, where a pair of corridors diverged toward their differing destinations.What does Mikal think about it?That its an exercise in anticipatory self congratulation.They fell over laughing, but there was an edgy sense of truth to the remark that followed Eli onto the train and all the way home.Home was a small apartment in the Squats, the gem enclave on the east London riverbank that had been first a refuge for escapees, and then for those who had gained their freedom on a rising tide of public opinion.After the international edicts outlawing retrieval and indenture, the derelict buildings had become a haven for thousands of gems suddenly released into communities unprepared, ill equipped, and often unwilling to handle the influx.They had banded together under the leadership of the still unrevealed Aryel Morningstar, been marshaled and managed by a phalanx of lieutenants with Mikal at their head, and built themselves a sanctuary.A few norms had joined them since, including the eminent anthropologist Dr.Eli Walker.He remembered the early mutterings that attended the genesis of the colony, about the creation of ghettoes and concentration of need, and his own surprise and unspoken glee when the gems turned their talents and training toward the repair of long abandoned housing and the care of those of their number modified out of any hope of self sufficiency.The gemtech claims of social inadequacy and limited potential had been effectively silenced.With legal normalization had come economic opportunity, and something of a vogue in gem culture and enterprise.The spectacle of Aryel, sweeping in and out on the wing to the gasps of visitors and the casual indifference of residents, added to the growing sense of an appealing exoticism.The shabby, insular neighborhood Eli had moved into was rapidly becoming chic.But integration brought its own challenges, he thought, not all of which could have been anticipated.He glanced into the ground floor lounge as he went past, noting the increasing concentration of the disabled and malformed.There was a time when their able bodied and attractive neighbors would have been in there too, keeping them company.Now they were all out working, or simply elsewhere.An alert chimed softly in his earset as he pushed back the door to his tiny balcony, letting out a wave of stale, sticky air.Aryels tone.She must have picked up his message.He felt a quick little rush of pleasure, followed instantly by a spike of annoyance at himself.Over the years of their friendship he had never been able to pin down quite why it was that doing her even the smallest of favors made him feel so elevated.He had concluded only that it was a phenomenon widely shared, though rarely remarked upon.Her response was typically succinct, grateful, and gently suggestive.I watched on tablet, but no comparison to the view from the room.Your impressions much appreciated.Similarly with this: and shed inserted a link to an item on the Festivals opening program.Worth checking out I should think.Eli already knew he was going to go to whatever it was, even as he tapped up the link.The new information washed onto the screen, and he felt his eyebrows shoot up.It would have been worth checking out even if Aryel had not requested it.Aryel herself was on the south bank of the river, close to where the airwalk Eli had observed outside City Hall terminated, this time at a staircase that dropped from the top of the embankment down to the foreshore.The tide was still coming in and the entry platform rose and extended smoothly, tread by tread, as gillungs swirled gracefully around it and made adjustments.She leaned against the rail, gazing down at them and politely ignoring the stares and whispers from her own level, the pointing fingers and surreptitious tablet flashes that accompanied her whenever she left the Squats.One of the gillungs pulled herself onto an unsubmerged stair, glanced up, and saw Aryel.She grinned and raised a hand.Sunlight glinted off the translucent webbing between her fingers.Hey!You going to stay up there and watch, or come down and get wet?Aryel laughed, both amused by the suggestion and grateful for the womans easy informality.You know thats not my territory.Id be about as useful as a cork.Other gillung heads popped up, and there were more calls and splashed greetings.Aryel waved back as the woman who had spoken to her ran up the remaining steps to the top.Water dripped from the tight cuffs of her bodysuit, trickling onto broad, webbed feet.Aryel leaned over the safety barrier and into a damp embrace.Graca, its so good to see you.Dyou know where the rest of my lot have gotten to?Im going straight into messages.Theres a concert hall here?Gwen wanted to see it.Hear it too, no doubt.You know what shes like, probably made them switch their sets off.Hows Rhys?A shadow crossed the other womans face.Hes okay.Says hes okay, anyway.Youre not convinced.Not completely, no.I better go find them.Aryel left the quayside and headed into the cavernous interior, built long ago for another Festival and after a tumultuous history, returned to its original use.The attention went with her, murmurs rippling ahead and trailing behind like some strange existential wake.She had long since decided that the best course was generally to act as though it wasnt there; to treat people as if they behaved better than they did, and hope that with time and familiarity the pretense would become truth.It was a careful and often, she thought, a hypocritical balance.She knew very well that the norm fascination with heradulation evenwas beyond the control, and usually even the awareness, of most of them.She also knew that she used it, gently and subtly, to keep herself and her people safe, to maintain their steady progress away from serfdom, and to counteract the very difficulties that celebrity created.It was a potent tool, and one that she should not, for purely practical reasons, wish to lose.Now, for instance, it took no more than a smile and a quiet few words to detail a security guard to help her swiftly negotiate the maze of corridors and locked doorways that led to the hall.Far from resenting the task, the mans dazed look said he could not believe he would be able to boast to his friends that evening that he had acted as escort to Aryel Morningstar.Still, he seemed honor bound to protest that their errand was likely to be fruitless.Its, umm, its locked, you can see, as he pressed fingers to an identipad.Theres no access to the hall for the general public just now, and no rehearsals or anything...Im afraid your party must have gone somewhere else...She nodded and smiled and said, Lets just check.And sure enough, as he swung the heavy old door back, voices washed up at them from the direction of the stage.The mans jaw dropped.Aryel sighed and walked past him.Lights had been switched on, illuminating only the front few rows.The elevated rear of the room, where they had entered, remained in dense shadow, as did much of the stage down below.Three figures could dimly be seen against the black of the backdrop; two heads glowed a deep wine red, like embers in the darkness.Someone was singing, a clear, pure tone that rolled up the banks of seats and sent a shiver of pleasure up the guards spine.It stopped abruptly, and an excited female voice said, Just listen to it!The way the sound changes, its so...so round, and full...You do sound great, Gwen, said another voice: older, benevolent, amused.It came from the figure without any gemsign glow, and changed abruptly as he became aware of movement in the shadows above.Whos there?Its Aryel, said the other two in unison.The third voice belonged to a younger male, who added, Were busted.You are indeed, she said.She was already halfway down the sloping chamber when the guard found the controls, and lights came up in the entire room.They picked out the two glow haired gems, who both looked to be in their early twenties: a willowy, weary looking youth, and a girl whose slender, athletic form and expressive face positively radiated well being.It was the contrast between lassitude and fizzing energy, the guard realized as he hurried after Aryel, that was their least similar feature; otherwise the resemblance was remarkable.They were lean and long limbed, and shared the same fine boned, full lipped features, along with flawless nut brown skin and eyes so dark a blue they could almost be black.Their companion was a white haired man, norm to all appearances, who looked to be enjoying a hearty old age.He paced to the front of the stage, hands clasped behind his back, and twinkled at Aryel as he boomed, And why is that?This is the peoples hall, after all.We are here only to appreciate our inheritance.Appreciation is confined to specific times or with appropriate escorts, as you know very well, Aryel shot back, but there was no hiding the answering smile in her voice.The girl jumped down from the stage, a distance and depth few norms could have managed safely, and skipped up to meet her.She threw her arms around the winged woman.Dont be mad, Ari.I just wanted to hear how it sounded.Aryel hugged her back, up on tiptoe in a vain attempt to match her height, wings billowing for balance.Im not.I cant speak for this gentleman, though.The guard was standing behind them, mouth still hanging open in astonishment.I. ..but...how did you get in?The other two had descended the stage by the more sedate route of the steps, and now came up to meet them.The younger man raised his hand sheepishly.That was me.Sorry.Wasnt my idea, shooting a glance at his fellow trespassers.I did lock everything behind us though.And we havent touched anything.Except the lights, said Gwen helpfully.Except the lights.The guard looked from the beautiful girl to her brotherwas he a brother?He thought gems didnt have siblings, not reallyto the old man, now enveloping Aryel in another embrace.But the locks, he said helplessly.And...and theres alarms and stuff.Alarms?said the young man, with an air of polite disbelief.Did we set off alarms?Sorry about that.Really.Didnt look like they were on.Yes they were.I mean, no you didnt.I mean I dont think so.Id have gotten a call.He tapped his earset, wondering how to handle the situation.They had obviously bypassed the security systems somehow, but no harm appeared to have been done and Aryel Morningstar clearly knew all about them.She shook her head ruefully.Rhys has a way with comms systems, Gwen has a way with Rhys, and Reginald here, she cast a fond look over her shoulder at the old man, has a way of indulging them.First trip to London, you see.Really?said the guard.His head was reeling.The names of Gwen and Rhys rang only the most distant of bells, but he recognized the reference to Reginald right away.It was a name he could connect with the trios appearance, and begin to make some sense of it all.The old man was dressed in the highly unfashionable, slightly shabby clothing characteristic of a Remnant.The two young peoples attire was not quite so outmoded, but neither was it of recent vintage.The full dimensions of the tale he could tell at the pub that night dawned on him.It would not be improved if he had to add that he had concluded the encounter by rousting Aryel Morningstars foster family.Later that afternoon, Aryel left Reginald, Rhys, and Gwen resting in her own cavernous apartment and tapped on another door in a quiet first floor corridor.It slid back to reveal a man with glowing flame colored hair and an air of subdued tension that receded when he saw her.Hey, Callan.Glad I caught you.He smiled a little and stood back so she could step inside.Everything all right?Fine.Just hanging out with him a bit, making sure he eats something.He gestured toward the small open kitchen, where the debris of a meal was in the midst of being tidied away.Ive got to go in a minute, though.Got some extra work this evening.Festival?Yeah.Translating for some of the newstreams.Will you be free to come to the show after?The flame haired man shrugged.Should be.If I feel like it.Aryel looked at him keenly.Although he was young, well shy of thirty, he gave an impression of greater age.It was perhaps that subtle quality in his demeanor, a slightly hunted watchfulness; or maybe just the faint traces of scarring on his handsome face, the shadow of some old injury that had been expertly repaired, but not quite completely erased.Please come, she said quietly.Lyriams only just gotten back, he hasnt even made it home yet, but he messaged me to say how much he misses us.Hes hoping as many as can make it will be there.I think hes got some new music up his sleeve.Really?He brightened a little.Ill try.Ill be looking for you.She turned, finally, to the other occupant of the room.Hello, Herran.Are you well?The diminutive gem to whom she spoke had not looked around, or otherwise appeared to register her arrival or the conversation with Callan.He sat with his back to the door, before a bank of auxiliary screens that showed a dizzying array of stream feeds and code; most of it incomprehensible to Aryel.He rocked for a moment, as if processing the greeting, and then turned to look at her.His curly hair glowed the same orange red as Callans.It was their only similarity.Herran had wide gray eyes and a face largely devoid of expression.Its most marked feature was a scar that ran between his nose and upper lip, old and pale but clearly mended with little care for the result.Aryel.He nodded, lisping softly.She approached, holding out her hands.Herran touched them briefly, and she settled onto a stool.Good today, he said.He had already turned back to the screens, and the input tablet on its stand before him, but she knew him well enough to sense that his attention was more broadly focused.This, along with the brief, ritualized response to her question, told her he was still listening to her as well.You keeping an eye on the Festival?Yes.He rocked a little.Fun.Lots to see.Im glad.Therell be lots going on this whole month.Funny thing happened there today though.Herran did not respond.The opening was too abstract, too lacking in specificity for him to engage with.Aryel knew this, but Callan had said they should keep lobbing innuendo at him occasionally, just in case.The thing that happened, Aryel went on, was that Rhys opened some doors that had locks and alarms on them, only he said the alarm circuits werent active when he went through.But they were supposed to be active, and when I went the same way a little later all of them were active.Like someone turned them off just for him, and then turned them back on again.Herrans rocking nod had become a little more emphatic.Though his expression did not change Aryel thought she detected a spark of something in the pale eyes.Easier for Rhys.No alarms.Quick quick.She sighed.Yes, it was easier and quicker.Did you turn them off for him, Herran?Yes.Quick quick.Easy.She dropped her head into her hands and shook it wearily, a gesture of affectionate exasperation that she knew would have no effect on Herran whatsoever.Behind her there was a snort of suppressed laughter from Callan.She took a moment to tamp down her own amusement and told herself sternly that it wasnt funny.Herran could cause untold trouble.When she looked up he was looking back at her, blankly innocent.She could suddenly have wept just as easily as laughed.How did you know he was there?Did he message you?Yes.Festival first, Squats later, concert tonight.Meet tomorrow.He kept his eyes on her, unblinking, as his fingers flew across the tablet.Found on cams.The image on one of the auxiliaries shifted, becoming a chequerboard of vidcam feeds from the Festival Hall and riverfront.Aryel recognized the route she had walked earlier that day.Keeping an eye on the Festival.Lots to see.Saw Rhys, and Gwen, and Reginald.Ah.Going to singing place.Gwen likes to sing.He was positively beaming now, or at least as close to it as he could get.I helped.Yes.Yes you did help Rhys, Herran.But you know youre really not supposed to do things like that.Wouldnt do for anyone else.He did not sound affronted, just matter of fact.Only Rhys and Callan and Mikal and Sharon and Bal and Gaela and Franko and Aster and Eli and you.Oh.Well, thats all right then.Only you had man.With hands.Aryel raised an eyebrow.Did himself.In the kitchen Callan had mostly been managing to turn his chortles into a reasonably convincing cough.Now he failed utterly.Aryel fought back a giggle of her own and focused on parsing what Herran actually meant.I had man with hands?I. ..oh, I see.The security guard with the fingerprint ident who opened the doors.Yes, I did have him to help me.Didnt need me.Well, not today.But I do need you a lot of the time, Herran.We all do.And its okay if you keep an eye on the Festival...as long as nobody can tell youre doing it He did look injured now.She hurried on, but dont turn off anymore alarms or change anything else there, okay?Not even for us.Breaking rules.Yes, thats breaking the rules.And we shouldnt break the rules very much.And when we do we need to have a very, very, very good reason.Binary       3 Eli waited until the room was almost full, with crowds still massed in the aisles, before slipping in as inconspicuously as possible.He was recognizable enough, especially in this crowd, for a few heads to turn, but no one spoke to him as he found a seat near the back, and he did not think he had been spotted by any of the organizing staff.He had no wish to be hailed from the stage by whatever functionary was conducting the Festivals formal launch, as could very easily happen if they knew he was there.There was no risk of such notice from the evenings keynote speaker, but he nevertheless felt an almost juvenile aversion to her discovering that he was in attendance.The terms on which they had last met had not been friendly.Mikal was down in front, among the other city officials, and it amused him to imagine the reaction that facing the giant gem would likely evoke; though doubtless she had been steeling herself since the election to keep her feelings well hidden.Still, this last minute trailing of a major announcement was a curious development, one which had attracted a flurry of comment from the business newstreams.He could understand Aryels desire for a first person report.He had glimpsed her as he made his way inside the massive building, fluttering to earth near the stage that had been erected on the riverwalks great park.Greeting Lyriam no doubt, and satisfying herself that all was in readiness for those attending the festivities at his invitation.Disability, either physical or psychological, was virtually unknown among norms but still distressingly common among gems.The older ones in particular had been designed, reared, and trained at a time when such matters barely rated consideration.Even though they had all since been raised to legal equality with norms, ensuring that crippled, disfigured, or dysfunctional gems got the assistance they needed still took a fair amount of coordination and cajoling.The people here, he thought as he looked around him, were probably about equally divided between those who had fought early and with diligence for those freedoms and support, and others who had clambered aboard the bandwagon but in truth would have slept no less well had the bad old days of gemtech domination never ended.They would not wish for a return to it, not now that their consciences had been pricked, but there was a malleability about them that the woman he had come to hear would understand well how to manipulate.Not unlike Aryel.The thought felt immediately both unworthyvile, evenand intriguing.Eli picked at it as the program got under way.Aryel too knew how to play people, how to express a perspective and inspire a response.He wondered if the only real difference between the two women was that he happened to share the winged gems sense of values.He quickly decidedsome deeply skeptical part of his mind whispered it might be too quicklythat it was more than that.Aryels approach was subtle.She used neither brutality nor blackmail; her weapon was an almost preternatural ability to persuade, a manner that was somehow both emotive and calmly rational.What she thought you should do became, after a few moments conversation, the only logical thing to do.That intellectual clarity and ability to communicate had put him in her corner.It was how she had hauled her people out of their post emancipation limbo and into the light.That and her beauty, and the magic of her wings.He emerged from his reverie in time to applaud the last of a parade of dignitaries.There were a few seconds of bustle before the lights tightened down again to illuminate only the stage.The Festival director reappeared on it, staring owl like into the gloom of the audience, and gathered up his full pomp to announce that as they were no doubt aware, the chief executive of the BelNatur conglomerate would be the final speaker.What was less well known, he told them, was that BelNatur had been early and generous supporters of the Festival, helping to fund much of the launch and the monthlong program of events.He was sure they would all give a very warm welcome to a woman many had heard of but fewunlike himself of coursehad been privileged to meet: Zavcka Klist.As he took to the stage to make his introduction, in the instant after the lights went down, the door through which Eli had entered was pushed open once again.There was a rustle as some latecomer slipped quickly in.When they did not immediately walk past him on the way to one of the few empty seats, he glanced around.He was astonished to recognize the distinctive profile of Aryel Morningstar against the soft blue glow of exit lights, stepping back against the wall, wings tucked in tight.A murmur started as those on either side of the aisle realized who stood there and he saw her raise a finger sharply to her lips.The murmur died away and she folded her arms, standing still as a stone.Zavcka Klist stood in the spotlight, gazing out into the darkened auditorium while perfunctory applause died away.She carried no tablet, and ignored the lectern onto which a prepared speech might have been projected.She seemed, Eli thought, to be letting them all take a good long look, the better to emphasize whatever point she had come here to make.She had changed little in the years since they had last met face to face.Slightly taller than the norm average, blond and dark eyed, she was possessed of a harsh aristocratic beauty.She had the gift of elegance, of wearing expensive clothes well and looking glamorous with little embellishment.She had favored scarlet lipstick then, he remembered, but no longer; her mouth was now a softer shade, and the lines of her stylish summer suit less stridently autocratic.But she was still Zavcka Klist.She still wasted little time on pleasantries.Our involvement with the Festival of the Future has struck many as anachronistic, she began.You may well wonder how a company that was on the brink of collapse not so very long ago, part of an industry whose day many consider done, can imagine itself to have much of a future.You all know Im not exaggerating when I tell you that the last few years have been, to say the least, challenging.There were a few titters of nervous laughter that degenerated hastily into scattered coughs.The financial challenges have been obvious and serious, but I am happy to report that they have largely been overcome.BelNatur remains a leader in agricultural gemtech and as a result we are once again approaching the levels of turnover and profitability that we enjoyed before the abolition of commercialized human gemtech.The silence rippled out.It was as though a stone had been dropped into the massed memories of a centurys shame; a deep, still pool of guilt and recrimination around which, by mutual and unspoken agreement, most norms preferred to tiptoe as silently as possible.Zavcka stared straight into the audience as she spoke, eyes traveling slowly along the seated ranks of gems and norms, a mingling made possible only by the abolition of which she spoke.Eli, who already knew what a bravura performance she was capable of, nevertheless found himself holding his breath.That was, of course, a watershed for the company, as indeed it has been for all of society.You will not be surprised to learn, ladies and gentlemen, gems and norms, that the cultural challenges it presented to us at BelNatur were beyond anything wed ever dealt with.Im not going to insult your intelligence by pretending that we had no difficulty facing up to the facts of our history, learning the lessons from it, and instituting the changes, both in our business practices and in our attitudes, to ensure that such a cavalier and unthinking application of technology could never occur within our company again.I am certainly not going to insult your sense of justice by suggesting that no wrongs were done.A loud murmur, with more than a hint, Eli thought, of the kind of self righteousness beloved of those who preferred not to consider their own complicity.People shifted and muttered to each other.He kept his eyes on the back of Mikals head, shoulders and half a torso higher than anyone elses, and noted that he had not moved a muscle.Zavcka stepped back a couple of paces, hands up in capitulation.Let me say this, loud and clear, so no one can be in any doubt where BelNatur stands on this today: Wrongs were done, and we did them, along with the rest of the industry.And while we could justifiably add that a medical crisis and lax regulation and social apathy were contributing factors, that doesnt actually let us off the hook.It has been a difficult thing to come to terms with, collectively and individually.I might not have been the chief executive during that time, but as you know Ive been in this business for many years and I, like all of us, should have known better.Eli felt an almost overwhelming disorientation.He remembered his first conversation with Zavcka Klist, just days before she took over the top job at what had once been the worlds most prestigious gemtech.There had been no humility then, and precious little contrition.He could not square that recollection with the apparent sincerity on display before him.He shook himself and glanced back at Aryel.Her arms were still folded across her chest, a counterpoint to the high bulge of her wings, and he could almost see the frown she bent toward Zavcka.He shifted his own attention back to the woman in the spotlight.So we deal with the past, Zavcka said, and she seemed to be looking directly at Mikal before turning away to pace the stage.We admit our mistakes, we try to help the people we hurt, and we move on.And moving on is what I mainly want to talk about this evening, ladies and gentlemen.Moving on is why were all here.In our case that involved a lesson from the past, and what we think it means for the future.As we examined the series of events that led us to where we are now, we noted the parallels between the way breakthroughs in genetic engineering were applied without due consideration for the consequences and the way advances in information technology had been adopted with reckless speed a century and a half ago.Now we know where the latter led usto the Syndrome, and a crisis that demanded we develop modification techniques just to survive.But what became apparent is that although society used gemtech to solve the problems created by infotech, we nevertheless abandoned infotech.Progress came to a crashing halt once the Syndrome was identified.Our technical capacity is almost exactly the same as it was at year zero.That is neither necessary nor desirable.She raised her hands again, this time a gesture of inclusion and uplift.The room murmured again, this time an expectant little ripple.They were hanging on her every word.Eli could not entirely conquer a reluctant sense of admiration.We believe that the next great advances in science and technology, the next wave of improvement in the way we live our lives, will come from picking up where we left off with infotech.So what I came here to tell you today is that, far from being consigned to the dustbin of history, the BelNatur Corporation is changing course.We are launching a major, long term research and development program into computing and information technologies.We now know how to do it safely, and as we travel down this new road we will be integrating what weve learned from human gemtechboth the scientific breakthroughs and the ethical imperatives.Over the next ten years we are going to be investing over a billion credits, creating thousands of new jobs, and bringing to market dozens of new products.We are going to be combining our unparalleled expertise in neural architecture with new concepts in software and hardware.We are going to launch the next phase of infotech.The midsummer sun was still high enough above the horizon to cast a golden glow over the gathering crowds on the riverwalk an hour later.Eli let himself be carried along in the flow of people heading toward the park, until he could step aside into a little nook where two ancient chestnut trees sheltered an empty bench.He sank down onto it and tried to think.Zavcka had wrapped her speech up quickly.The grandee who had introduced her bounced back onstage, grinning widely, and invited questions.Eli wondered if Aryel would stay and challenge or slip away as unobtrusively as she had arrived, but she did neither.Instead she had waited until the lights came up, waited until they touched the wall where she stood and Zavcka Klists eyes had focused on her and widened, before she sidestepped quickly to the door and out.By then people were on their feet all over the room and salvos were being fired at the stage.They ranged predictably from anxious inquiries about safety, to what sorts of products she thought might emerge, to quantifying the economic impact.She had gone straight to Mikals raised hand, though, despite knowing that he must be about to ask her to explain precisely what she meant by integrating human gemtech.Work had already begun, she said, in the pre Syndrome era, on direct interfaces.But they did not understand enough then about how the brain was structured and how it worked; progress was slow, patchy, and ultimately abandoned.We have the answers to those questions now, she said.And while we can regret the manner in which much of that knowledge was gained, I dont think it honors anybody to simply not use it.On the contrary, it seems to me that we have an obligation to turn it into something worthwhile.Much of the original research focused on disability, for example, and working in difficult environments like space.Or underwater.If we can use what we already know to link this, she pointed to her own head, directly to this, and she took a tablet out of the Festival directors hand and held it up with the same restrained theatricality, then there are so many problems we can solve.She handed the tablet back, her attention still on Mikal.Were not talking about new gemtech.But I understand the concerns behind your question, Councillor, and I respect them.Its a question that should be asked.A few seconds of silence then, the audience bemusedly contemplating the unexpected courtesy she was showing to Mikal.Eli could imagine the split lidded blink with which he filled it, something he thought his friend sometimes did on purpose when he wished to be disconcerting.There are many questions that should be asked, Mikal had replied evenly.And answered.I look forward to it.Eli knew her well enough to recognize the flash of anger in Zavcka Klists eyes as she registered the rebuke.A few people seemed to realize that they had missed something, but it sailed too far over the heads of most.Mikal sat back, giving up the floor and watching her weather the torrent.Now Eli kept an eye on the passing crowd until the giant loomed into view.He raised a hand.Mikal waved back and changed course, navigating to the edge of the flow of people so that Eli could fall into step beside him.Well, he said, channeling well worn irony, that was interesting.Mikal laughed, a gusty tone with an edge of bitterness to it.Which part?The rebirth of infotech, the recycling of gemtech, or Zavcka Klist being my new best friend?That last one is the killer.Did she speak to you again?I slipped out when it looked like there was going to be mingling.No love lost between us, as you know.I think she would have been nice even to you.She came straight up to me, handshake, congratulations, the whole thing.Said she didnt think it would have been helpful to get into a technical discussion about neurochemistry from the stage but she didnt want me to think she was being evasive, they intend to be completely open, blah, blah, blah.Subject to commercial constraints, of course.Of course.Though she did make a point of saying they want to set up a protocol with the regulators to ensure that the protection of intellectual property doesnt undermine transparency.Quite how you manage that I dont know, but shed be very happy for me to help work it out.Blimey.Do you believe her?Do I believe that she wants me on her private stream, or popping by the office?That she mortifies herself nightly over what BelNatur did?Over what she allowed to happen to Gabriel, and Callan, and goodness knows how many others?No, no and no.She doesnt look nearly shredded enough.The big man sighed and ran a hand through his hair.It was medium length and a nondescript lightish brown.The modifications he bore were more than sufficient gemsign; his designers had correctly judged that topping them off with a jewel colored, phosphorescent mane would have been redundant.His double thumbs left twin furrows on either side of his head.But is she now genuinely trying to chart a new course?She might be, Eli.She knows they cant go back to the old days.Innovate or die, as they used to say at Recombin.Infotech has been stagnant for a long time.We are all Syndrome safe now, gems and norms, even the Remnants.BelNatur might be up to exactly what she says theyre up to.You sound like a politician, Mik.Go wash your mouth out.With soap.Binary        Upbringing She grows up in a city.They live high above the sweat and dirt and horror that haunts most of it, in the heart of the old, proud seat of empire.She is accustomed to looking out of tall windows at soaring spires and swirling domes, their fairground gaiety at odds with the blocky, bland pragmatism of the modern buildings below.She gazes at the bright temples and palaces for hours sometimes, intensely, as if she could couple her concentration to their sleeping grandeur and bring a lost world to life; and in her minds eye she does see the pennants and pageants that they once hosted, the great romances and golden ages and armies marching home in triumph.All her life she will love architecture that curves and sweeps and does more than merely contain.Her father rarely looks out of the windows.His enchantment is reserved only for her, and she sometimes wishes she could interest him elsewhere, become less the laser sharp focus of all his days.But she is his light and his life, he tells her, his greatest achievement and the only one which will matter in the end.Outside is only grief and despair and the slow degradation of all else he has treasured.He seems not to share her ability to unhear the moans of the afflicted and wails of the bereaved, to unsee the smoke that rises from a thousand thousand cremations.He worries endlessly about the emptiness of the world in which she will one day have to make her way, about how she will cope and whether she can be happy.To be the only precious child of a rich and powerful man guarantees little in this latter, desolate age.She knows that he is among those battling against the plague, and that though they may have the answer now to the diseases vicious question, victory is still far from certain.They have lost so much ground.So few remain to fight.He is one of the rare ones able to protect his own, and he has bequeathed the armor of immunity to her.It is not his only gift.Binary       4 The park was already very full.Eli and Mikal headed for the bandstand.Heads turned as they went past, but the looks and half overheard comments all seemed friendly enough as they skirted the families and couples spreading bioweave blankets and unpacking picnics.Children chased each other between the little encampments, shrieking with delight.As usual the majority of the kids appeared to be norms, although this could be deceptive.It was not uncommon for naturally conceived gem childrenat any rate those healthy enough to run and playto bear no obvious gemsign.And it had only been a few years since gems were free to have their contraceptive implants removed and to find out, with trepidation and much heartache, whether their engineered genomes would allow conception, whether the resulting fetuses would be viable, and at what cost.Eli stole a sideways glance at Mikal, caught him watching a gaggle of noisy five  and six year olds clambering over a jungle gym.His expression was hard to read; there was curiosity there, and longing, and loss.Eli looked away, not quickly enough.The giant spotted the motion and sighed.Since youre politely not asking, yes, were still trying, and no, no luck yet.Eli let it sit for a moment, then said quietly, You could always go in vitro.I know.Still no guarantee just mixing things up in a Petri dish would work, though.Unless we had them engineer us a solution.Thats what I meant.Mikal was silent for a while.The shouts and laughter of the children were well behind them when he said, Sharon is up for that, but Im not sure I am.I really want kids, but itd mean authorizing human gemtech.On myself, my own offspring.Im struggling with that.And if we did go ahead, what instructions would I give?Wed have to decide whether to opt for minimum interference, just enough for a healthy baby, or have them carve out all the weirdness in my genetype so our kids could have regular hands and eyes and inside leg measurements.He turned his hands palm up, the four thumbs mirroring each other across their broad, creased surfaces, and looked at them for a moment as though they were found things whose provenance was uncertain.He dropped them back to swing at the level of Elis midriff.Whats the right thing to do there, Eli?What should I wish for my children?The question hung between them.Eli had known it must be part of what Mikal and Sharon were trying to reconcile, along with many thousands of gems worldwide.Relatively few of them, though, were in mixed couples, and he hesitated before asking the obvious question.What does Sharon think about that part?As close to a normal random recombination as possible would be her choice.She says she doesnt want our kids to only look like her.There was a note in his voice that brought a sudden lump to Elis throat.He waited until he was sure he could trust himself.For whatever its worth, I agree with her, Mik.Theres nothing wrong with the way you look...Thanks, but seriously.I am being serious.The norm population was so homogenized by Syndrome safety gemtech that even small variations in appearance look big to us.I know, I know, holding up his hands, ...small is not a word that applies to you, but my point is, those reactions will fade over time.They really will.And in the meantime, if you undo all the things in your genetype that make you you, what does that say to your kids?There is also that.So.Im struggling.They reached a gate set into the fence that separated the backstage area and were waved through, to the envious looks of clusters of fans gathered outside.All norms, Eli noticed.Lyriams music was hugely popular among his own people as well, but the concept of celebrity was one to which gems appeared mostly immune.Inside, they made their way to a clump of marquees that had sprung up like angular, oversize white mushrooms, and wandered among them until Mikal, peering over a biocanvas slope, said, There she is, and led them around the corner.Aryel stood in a little courtyard formed by four of the white tents, talking to a young man with jet black hair and long, elegant, seven fingered hands.Reginald was with her, along with two ruby haired youths whom Eli recognized from their stream profiles as Rhys and Gwen.Even from a distance the girl radiated a sort of effervescent enthusiasm; he could see it in the way she leaned into the conversation and the expressive gestures of her hands as she described something.Rhys hung back, diffident and, Eli thought, a little tired looking.It is our conquering hero, returned from the East, trumpeted Mikal, and they all turned around.The black haired man came forward laughing, and his seven fingers and Mikals double thumbs met in what must have been one of the worlds most complicated handclasps, before the giant pulled him into a hug.Eli busied himself shaking hands with Reginald and being introduced to the others.At last!laughed Gwen.I was beginning to think you werent really real.Rhys shot her an unreadable look and said quietly, Its good to finally meet you, Dr.Walker.Up close his initial impressions were confirmed: The young woman had a vivacity that was infectious.It was hard not to smile in her presence, not to become interested in turn in the myriad little details of preparation going on around them that had caught her attention.Her brother was clearly the introvert of the pair, less talkative and easy, but, Eli discovered as they chatted, just as keenly observant.He was struck too by Reginalds paternal affection for them; a sense of proud guardianship that might once have also been there for Aryel.But she had flown so far now that theirs had become a friendship between equals.And though much of her early life among the Remnants remained mysterious, Eli knew she had been older when she came to them.The three visitors appeared to have already become fast friends with Lyriam, who emerged, staggering a little for comic effect, from Mikals embrace.Weary though he must have been after almost a year on tour, he was as energetic and focused as ever.Too busy to be tired, he said when Eli commented on this.And you cant let yourself be distracted before a performance anyway.Ive learned that.I might fall over for a few days after tonight, but then there are things to sort out.And I want to work on some new stuff...I heard the most amazing musicians in Australia...Dyou mean the aborigems?asked Gwen.I listened to those links you posted, its wonderful, sort of...and she tipped her head back and let out a long, trilling series of notes, sweet and haunting.Lyriam said, Yes, exactly, and then they do these chords, and he sang a low, spine tingling ululation, his fingers keeping time along an imaginary instrument, while the hairs on the back of Elis neck stood up and he stared from one to the other.Reginald laughed at his expression.Theyve been doing that all evening.Whole new conversational form.Your friend Callan, nodding to Aryel, should write a paper.They stood around chatting for a few more minutes, until Eli felt Aryels eyes on him, and caught the tiny sideways inclination of her head.They stepped away from the others.He glanced over his shoulder as they moved out of earshot.Youd think theyve known each other all their lives.But wheres Lyriams other half?We saw Bethany earlier, shes somewhere around.Seems there might be a little bit of tension there at the moment.Really?He was so astounded that Aryel laughed.I dont suppose theyre immune.Its been a hard trip and, you know, she shrugged, things are changing.Theyre growing up.I guess.Still.Have to hope the socialstreams dont get hold of that.She did not respond, which for Aryel, Eli later thought, was significant.They wandered away from the preperformance buzz of the tents to a quiet corner where she could perch gratefully on a tree stump, the gnarled tombstone of some ancient coppice.Eli was reminded of how much energy it took for her to fly, and how little time she would have had today to rest and eat.She must be exhausted.She looked up at him, a sharp sky blue gaze full of the lively intelligence that had first attracted him.There was no weariness in it.So.Our old friend Zavcka.What did you think?Straight to the point.He picked through his impressions, organizing them.I dont think it can be a bluff, not announcing it in that way.She must really be making a play for infotech.From what I know of that industrywhich isnt muchits dominated by just a few big legacy players whove been churning out pretty much the same stuff for almost a hundred and fifty years.Its ripe for innovation.That part makes sense.She was looking at him oddly, and he realized too late that he had simply delivered his opinion without first describing the event.Oh well.So much for waiting to see if shed tell me herself.He was never able to dissemble with her anyway.I saw you there, Aryel, I know you heard for yourself what she had to say.What did you think?Did you?Ah.Well as far as infotech is concerned, I agree with you.Im less convinced by her assurances around gemtech.Im still trying to wrap my head around that.Its not like she could say anything different, not these days...I know....But she went out of her way to say quite a lot.More than it seems she needed to.He told her about Zavcka Klists exchanges with Mikal after she had left.If shes acting shes gotten a lot better at it.So you think shes a reformed character?I wouldnt go that far.He thought.What do we know about her from last time?That shes pragmatic and intelligent.And devious.This is a strategy.Again, I agree.Shes sharp enough to know theres no way back to the days of indenture, but its clear she hasnt lost interest in us either.She wouldnt be courting Mik like that without a reason.And theres something else as well.She fell silent, as if thinking the something else over, until Eli said, She doesnt seem quite as unshakeable as she used to.Your being there rattled her, I think, though only for a moment.Aryel nodded, still musing.It was meant to.Im not going to sit politely back and wait to see what shes up to this time.She shook herself, wings rustling, and flicked a glance at Eli.They changed the schedule at the last minute this morning, some flunky from the BelNatur press office replaced by Zavcka herself, so I knew it had to be important.But Mik was going to be there representing the city, and I thought youd be interested given your history with her, and I knew I could rely on you both to tell me all about it.So there was really no need for me to go.And then, barely a couple of hours ago, she sent a message.To you?She asked you to come?It hadnt looked like it.Goodness no, and I probably wouldnt have gone if she had.It wasnt about her announcement, not on the face of it anyway.She sent it to Herran.Herran?Herran.She paused, frowning into the distance again.It was from her personally, very polite and respectful.Said BelNatur was working on a new project that they thought would suit someone of his particular skills.Hastened to add that it wasnt gemtech and they particularly wanted to speak to him about working with them in a senior capacity, that they were sure he would find it a good fit and very rewarding.All of her contact details attached.What theHave they met Herran?Not recently.But dont forget, they made him.There were cues buried in the message, command phrases she must have hoped he would still respond to.The Herran they knew was far more biddable than he is now.Again that bitter shake of the head.You should have seen him when he first came to us, Eli.His autism may make him seem a bit like an automaton, but he really was one then.Hed been trained to it, theyd worked out the most efficient way to get him to understand and obey orders, and it was the only way he knew how to be.Inputs and outputs.But hed gotten out before the Declarationat the time he couldnt even tell us howand found his way to the Squats.So we knew there had to be more to him than they knew.Theyll since have come to the same conclusion, but she probably didnt realize hed immediately forward her message to me.With an addendum.Which was?Aryel fix.Eli shook with laughter.He could imagine the carefully crafted rhetoric Zavcka would have employed, and how annoyed she would be to have it both covered and dismissed by one of Herrans unvarnished utterances.Good for him.So you decided to start the fixing by letting her know that whatever shes up to, shes going to have to deal with you.Exactly.And do you know what she is up to, Aryel?What does she want with Herran?Im not sure, but it must be connected.She was being fairly disingenuous when she said that infotech was a new direction for BelNatur.She gazed thoughtfully back in the direction of the tents, where the ruby heads of her foster siblings twinkled next to the white mane of Reginald and the tower that was Mikal.That expertise she was talking about wasnt just bluster.They did lead the industry in neural engineering.What she didnt mention was why they focused on it so much.They were trying to design gems who could be plugged in.Literally.A bioprocessor.They didnt succeed, not in the way they intended, and the collateral damage was horrendous.But they were making progress.Theyd gotten further than they realized.And Im wondering if they do know, now.You mean Herran...?Herran came out of the bioprocessor program.The cleft palate he was born with was the result of them trying to engineer a physical neuroconnection point, but he doesnt need one.He can readand writeraw code.He still has to do it through a tablet, but he can interface at the binary level.With showtime fast approaching, Lyriam had excused himself.Aryel was still deep in conversation with Eli over in a far corner as Mikal led the way to the hospitality tent, talking to Reginald about the gillung coastal technology and how it had been adapted for the Thames.Rhys, listening idly as he and Gwen strolled behind them, and enjoying the relative quiet of several conversations reduced finally to one, was struck suddenly by the unlikelihood of this.He glanced over at his sister.Her eyes flicked across everything around them as sharply as ever, but her expression had turned thoughtful, almost brooding.She felt his gaze and returned it.He grunted a wordless question.She shrugged it away with a raised eyebrow and quirked lip, shifted her gaze to the ground in front of them.He waited a moment, then tried again.Guh.Gwennie.Ah?Clipped off, preoccupied.What?Ah.Tell me.Nuh.Dno.Nothing.Dont know.Suh.Dla?Something.Dont like?She looked up and around at that, at the evening deepening over the tents and the murmur of the crowd on the far side of the fence.Luloh.Like lots.Ah?Then?He touched her arm, lightly but with a touch of anxiety.Ki?Are you feeling okay?Of course Im okay.At the suggestion of this particular worry, she fell fast out of the truncated emotiveness of twin speak.Im not the one who has a problem, remember?Oh, please rub it in.Sorry, I didnt mean to.I just wish people would stop thinking that if I go quiet there must be something wrong with me.Gwennie, as a rule thats the only time you ever do go quiet.She scowled at him, but did not argue the point.I was just taking it all in, imagining what it must be like to be part of something like this.To make music on this scale.They stepped inside the bustling cavern of the tent.Rhys shot her an appraising look and shuffled sideways into an empty spot near the entrance, letting Mikal and Reginald plow on ahead.Gwen gazed after their receding backs, and turned to him with another twitch of lips and brow.I know this isnt the main reason were here, but isnt it okay for me to get excited about it anyway?Its what I love, Rhys, its what I want to do.And the reality of it is so much more...Her hands shaped something enormous.And hes great, isnt he?Who?Lyriam, you idiot.Rhys blinked at her.Hes all right.I thought he seemed really...generous.For what?Rhyss voice was dry.Babysitting us when Ari had to fly off, or complimenting your singing?Oh, you ass.She stared at him in dismay.It took no more than a mortified second for him to realize that he had actually hurt her feelings, confirmed when she punched him hard on the arm.Ow!Gwennie, stop.Since when cant you take a joke?He rubbed his arm.I think hes really nice, I just didnt expect him not to be.Neither did I.  Thats not whatOh.Her eyes had picked out something in the crowd over his shoulder and Rhys turned around.An eddy in the swirl of people revealed a young woman, talking with who could only be more of Lyriams guests.She broke off as she saw them.Her lips tightened for a moment, before she said something to the gems she was with and headed over.She had shiny blond hair with no gem glow.Hi there.Her voice as she arrived was so bright and brittle that Rhys felt his own face twitch in surprise.He stilled it.You two all right?Need anything?It was Rhys, wasnt it, andand Gwyn?Gwen, said Gwen.Were fine, thank you, Bethany.Everythings wonderful.There was a guarded, almost formal politeness in his sisters response that sank into Rhyss consciousness and briskly started to link up with all the other minor peculiarities of the past few hours.Wheres that guy of mine?
