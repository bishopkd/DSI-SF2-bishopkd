The fear felt like falling falling through darknessfalling forever because there was nothing to fall to.Deep space had no pull, no solidity.There was only hopeless spinning in the void and tumbling fear within.What life begins, death must end but so much death had its own gravity well, impossible to escape, an open grave that had drawn millions from existencefriends, strangers, enemies, loversturning everyday loss to utter loss.He was falling, so I caught him, grasping his wrist as the arc of his orbit passed me.I tugged him down to the ground and turned him right side up so he could see the huge silver moon rising over the horizon.I touched the tip of my forefinger to his, kindling a golden glow, and placed my hand gently over his heart as I whispered the timeless clich for all those who no longer had voices to tell him.The light from the opening shuttle door woke me.They came tiptoeing in.Shhhh, I signed one handed, and pointed down at the cot.His hand loosely gripping mine, chest rising and falling slightly, Dllenahkh was asleep.REMEMBRANCE DAY Something changed.It was bizarre.We had been side by side in the dark, hands touching, minds touching, and some of that intimacy lingered in speech and shared silence, but I still could not find a way to ask him directly about his nightmare.True, much of our time together was in a purely professional setting, but even so, I wasnt sure I had earned that right.I read voraciously instead, my desire to impress giving way to an insatiable curiosity about old Sadira, New Sadira, and the disaster in between.The hidden motive behind my new obsession was not professional but personal.During our close communication, I had seen myself through Dllenahkhs eyes.It had been disconcerting, even alien.I found myself wondering how the average Sadiri would view me, something Id hardly cared about when I was visiting the settlement.The standards for courtesy and professionalism could not be the same as the standards forfriendship.Kissing was a minor detail.Im no Gilda; I didnt want to experiment.I wanted to get things right, and I had no idea how to go about it.I stood before the mirror, paused and pondering, a stick of kohl held loosely in my fingers.Everything else was as usual.I was wearing a long black skirt and a belted white short sleeved tunic.My wrap remained on the bed in my hotel room.I would go bareheaded tonight and see if I could get accustomed to the unruly, thumb length fuzz that my hair had become after nearly four months without a trim.A band pulled it back smoothly from my forehead in an attempt at elegance.I looked fine.The concert hall wouldnt throw me out.A knock at the door startled me.Lian came into our shared bathroom and in two seconds took in my slightly guilty look and the stick of kohl, which I was sheepishly trying to make disappear behind my back.Dont worry, Lian said with a gentle, understanding smile.Some things are too important for teasing.You look sharp tonight, I said quickly, opting for diversion.Lian went to the mirror and ran a professional eye over each crease and fastening, each braid and ribbon, ensuring that everything was in place.Itll do.My colleagues from the Cygnian Military Service and the Interplanetary Science Council had been invited to a Remembrance Ceremony commemorating those who had died in the crisis events that had brought various peoples to Cygnus Beta.The entire team had attended a general service of remembrance earlier in the day, but this was something exclusive for the military and quasi military bodies, perhaps a special reminder of their mandate to protect humanity.We were in town for only a couple of days en route to another visit, so I hadnt been surprised when Qeturah declared she was happy to stay in and rest and Joral said he had to catch up on some work.Dllenahkh, on the other hand, was interested in going to a local performance of Pakals Requiem and asked me if Id like to come along.I said yes.It wasnt an unusual invitation by any means, yet there I was, standing in the bathroom with a stick of kohl held indecisively in my fingers.Lian gave the shoulders of the dress uniform one final brush, looked at me, and nodded.Ill give you some privacy.When the door closed, I laughed a short, quiet laugh at myself and applied the kohl.Ganymede is a small town, but it prides itself on its history and culture.As a result, the concert hall was impressive and the orchestra magnificent, rivaling even the finest in Tlaxce City.I did not regret my efforts to look my best, and I was foolishly proud of Dllenahkh too.He could take the simplicity of a formal suit and make it as crisp and stylish as any military dress uniform.The small teak elephant I had given him rode discreetly on the collar of his shirt, adding to my satisfaction.Pakals Requiem is very moving but not particularly long, and that suited my mood perfectly that night.We spent a mere thirty minutes with the orchestra and the audience, then went out with the rest of the crowd to mill about in the brightly lit town park.We were both rather silent.It was that kind of evening.Everyone, couples and families alike, seemed a bit hushed and reflective as they walked, as if it were a planetwide holy day.Does Sadira have a Day of Remembrance?I asked Dllenahkh.I meant to say New Sadira, but he overlooked the slip and answered directly.Different tribes have had different ways and times for honoring their ancestors and fallen heroes.There is nothing as specific as this, although in time there may be.I stopped walking and looked up at him with a small frown.There hasnt yet been a ceremony for the loss of Sadira?Its been well over a year.He bowed his head slightly, matching my frown, as if genuinely puzzled that such a thing had not yet taken place.The day was remembered, but not as a formal event.I supposeI believe we have been too busy to think of such a thing.We walked on in silence for a while.Although, he continued in a low voice, to do so would have meant accepting that there could be no returning to Sadira in our lifetime, nor for many generations to come.I suspect we were not ready to admit that.My hand brushed his tentatively.His fingers curled around mine, briefly answering the touch, then withdrew.With a look and a nod, he indicated a bench a little off the path, half screened by high shrubbery.I followed him, and we sat down to watch the people walk by.I promised some time ago to tell you the story behind my meeting with the Consul when we were in Karaganda, he said.I stared at him, my attention caught.You did.That was a few months back.Are you ready to tell me now?He nodded.There is much you have learned from reading our government reports.It may be easier for me to explain now.I racked my brain, trying to think what could have been in the several extremely dry reports I had read that would have a bearing on our conversation now.I drew a blank, so I simply smiled invitingly and waited for him to begin.His opening sentence was unexpected.How did it feel when you were recovering from your injuries and I linked to your mind to speed your bodys healing?Dllenahkh would never ask an idle question.I paused and pondered over the memory of it.It felt like your blood was in my veins.It felt like your neural electricity was in my nerves and brain and spine.I wish I could be clearer.Your awareness was tangled up in mine.Am I making any sense?He was looking at me and smiling very gently, somewhere between the proud smile of a master whose student has answered correctly and the fond smile of a friend who finds himself perfectly understood.Go on.You are doing very well.I continued courageously with my wild guessing.I suppose, from what Nasiha tries to teach me and from what Ive read of the mindships, thats how the Sadiri mind works.You extend your awareness of yourself beyond the boundaries of your physical body.Its generally a benign psionic influencecase in point, when you took over the parts of my body that were not under my conscious control and helped me heal faster.Thats also how a mindship pilot operates.He or she becomes the shipno, waitnot quite.The ship becomes part of the pilot.The smile was my barometer, and it did not falter, though he gave one clarification.Simplified but not inaccurate.The Sadiri mind, as you say, works in this way.Remember, however, this is due to early training and constant practice.The Sadiri brain is still a human brain, only with more of its potential realized.He raised his hands and regarded the palms meditatively, tilting them to catch the warm light of the parks solar lanterns.Zhinuvians have a higher concentration of semiconducting material in their skin, which permits them to talk to machines with greater ease than to other sentient minds.Their way of navigating their interstellar craft reflects this difference in approach.We too possess some of this ability to interface with man made intelligence, but our skill mainly lies with the organic, independent mind.I am aware, I said carefully, because I could not say that I understood, that your ships, unlike the Zhinuvian ships, are alive, not crafted.He lowered his hands and nodded.I enjoyed our brief time at the mahouts village.Their attachment to their elephants is very like how our pilots bond with their ships.It is a lifelong commitment.I have heard of only one instance of a pilot who gave up his ship willingly.That is the story I am about to share with you now.He relaxed and leaned back, gently putting aside a few untrimmed leafy twigs from the nearby bushes that tried to dangle about his head like a sparse laurel crown.I turned toward him, drawing my feet onto the seat and under my skirt.A talkative Dllenahkh was rare and most welcome.I would let him speak uninterrupted and ask my questions later.During my years of training and study in the mental disciplines, I encountered many people who became pilots.Most of them were off planet when the disaster struck, and yet a significant number died in futile attempts to transport people from the surface of Sadira.One of the survivors came to Cygnus Beta to speak at a special meeting held by an emissary from New Sadira.The entire local Council of our settlement was in attendance to discuss and decide on a matter that would affect us alla plan to save Sadira.What I am about to tell you may sound as far fetched as the tales of the Caretakers sound to some non Cygnians, but I ask you to proceed for the moment as if both were equally true.A mindship can travel in space and time.For most interstellar journeys, a pilot plots a shortcut through the unseen dimensions of space time in order to travel swiftly between distant points in the visible dimensions.It is also possible to plot a course that makes use of a second dimension of time, but it is a rare and still experimental practice which is only done far from the usual shipping routes as our scientists continue to assess and document the effects.In short, we had the technology to send a pilot back to a time before the disaster.What could be achieved there was a matter of debate.Some felt that averting the disaster would only create a parallel time line in which Sadira remained alive but we would continue in this time line, unaware and unaffected.Others were convinced that the method by which Sadira was destroyed was so advanced that it must have come from the future, thus creating a parallel time line in which we are now living.They further believed that parallel time lines are not sustainable, and if we were to stop the disaster from happening, this present existence would evaporate, leaving only the original reality where Sadira never died.Then there were the pessimists, who believed that nothing could be changed.They were, however, willing to believe that the pilot could uncover evidence of how the Ainya had triggered the disaster and bring the information back to us so we could ensure that no other planet would face devastation of this magnitude.Naraldi, an experienced and well traveled pilot, was selected for the mission.I know him well.He has always been highly pragmatic in approach.Cutting short the debate, he accepted the three different mission briefs, to be acted on according to his own analysis of the situation.He then gave up his mindship to link with a specially modified vessel.Traveling far from the populated sectors of the galaxy, he set out on the new, untried courseand disappeared.And we waited.Months later, the emissary returned to confirm in person the news we had already received.The mission had been a success, and yet not so, for our fate had not changed and no evidence had been discovered.We were to continue as if we had never attempted such a thing, and no further discussion would be entertained.In time, reports from the scientists analyzing the mission would be made available to higher ranking government officials.He paused, coming out of storyteller mode to meet my spellbound gaze.You have read one of these reports, from my own handheld.Do you remember it?I tried.I think I remember the occasion, but as for the report, I mainly recall that I didnt understand very much at all.It was highly technical.The corner of his mouth quirked briefly upward in wry agreement.The amount of complex multivariate calculus in that report was somewhat off putting.However, the gist of it was that there are already stable parallel time lines in existence.Naraldi was not able to change our fate, because he had no way of navigating to our past.He was able to reach many other pasts of different time lines and see other presents and futures as well.But his own line he could not touch.His expression became shadowed, regretful.Now you can understand why no ceremonies were held.We were still hoping to make the nightmare simply vanish away.What happened to Naraldi?I asked.He blinked away the sadness, his look growing sharp and assessing.He returned safely after about five months.You met him.He is now the Sadiri Consul on Cygnus Beta, an honorable and restful assignment from a grateful government.That aged face, those sorrowful eyes.Creeping horror stilled me as I absorbed this.How long was he out there?Dllenahkh shrugged.No one can tell.What chronometer could have made sense of his journeys?He was seventy years old when he left, barely middle aged by our reckoning.Now he appears to be at least fifty years older than that.Fifty years in only a few months!I was appalled.Dllenahkh took pity on me.Do not be distressed on his behalf.When I spoke to him, he told me he had had some pleasant experiences and some less so, but he had never once been bored.For a mindship pilot, that is more than enough.Suddenly he leaned forward, looking sideways at me in a manner that was half secretive, half triumphant.His voice became very quiet.There was one very interesting thing that he learned which is extremely relevant to our time line.He discovered, well before the fact, how Ain was quarantined.I shifted closer to catch every word, every nuance of his tone and expression.Go on, I urged, both amused and excited that he had indulged in a little theatrical pause.Anyone trying to enter the Ain system will simply find themselves on the opposite side, having passed only empty space between.The planet has been placed in an elegant pocket of folded space time, a feat which is well beyond the abilities of anyone from this timeanyone that we know, that is.What happened to those off planet Ainya who tried to return after the quarantine?I wondered.Dllenahkhs face became completely expressionless, which spoke to me of hidden anger.No Sadiri pilot would have taken them, and as for the ZhinuviansI think that we have seen for ourselves how they would treat a passenger who did not have the funds for a return trip.I nudged his knee with the back of my hand and was rewarded when his bleak look lifted.He spoke lightly, changing the subject.It may be of interest to you that in one of the time lines Naraldi visited, it was the Ntshune and not the Sadiri who became influential in galactic government.I laughed out loud.Come on!He shook his head in amusement at my cynicism.I know that at times we Sadiri give the impression that we consider our minds to be the finest in the galaxy.I assure you, I know this is not the case.A more ambitious Ntshune government could easily have surpassed us as diplomats and judges.Even the Zhinuvians, who already have the fleet to challenge us, only lack unified government to guide them into a position of power.Well, thank you for telling me that.Itll be our little secret, I joked.Humility was not a common Sadiri traitbut then again, Dllenahkh had always been unique.He smiled.You can do something for me in turn.Tell me about the Caretakers.My eyes widened.What can I tell you?Its not likeI meanwe dont have reports on them; theres no branch of study dedicated to them.Its all folktales and oral history.Not a religion, not even a superstition, but justthere, part of our identity as Cygnians.Then tell me what you can, he insisted, facing me fully and pointedly giving me his complete attention.I paused.Id never discussed anything remotely metaphysical with the Sadiri.It made me realize that for all I pretended otherwise, I did care what they thought about me.It did matter to me that even if they saw me as talkative, emotional, and half out of control most of the time, at least they could not fault my scientific mind.My tongue felt strangely heavy as I tried to talk of things I had secretly forbidden myself to discuss.To Cygnians, the Caretakers are the guardians of humanity.Theyre supposed to save the best of us from the worst of us, even if its only a remnant.Were not perfect here on Cygnus Beta, but at least for those who claim to have been brought by the Caretakers, theres an additional claim that they were saved for a reason, chosen for a purpose.Not because theyre better than any other group but because theres something unique they possess, some characteristic that contributes to the fullness of humanity.Its a responsibility, not a point of pride.Its something to live up to, and it helps keep us going.Admirable, said Dllenahkh, and his tone was neither cautiously neutral nor subtly judging, as I had feared it might be.It was mildly but distinctly approving.I felt encouraged enough to continue.If all the tales are true, no ones seen the Caretakers face to face.No flaming chariots, no wheels within wheels, no wings.Its a very boring legend when you think about itjust some people following the music of an invisible Pied Piper, disappearing into one cave near Hamelin, Terra, and emerging from another cave near Hamelin, Cygnus Beta.Do Cygnians have any theories about what exactly the Caretakers are?Dllenahkh inquired, apparently rapt by the little I was telling him.I shrugged.No one thinks they are gods.Thats religion, and weve got plenty of that already.Some say they are humans from the past and pour out a libation for them.Others say they are people from the future and light fragrant incense to them.Another group says they are souls tasked after death to do all the work that wasnt done in life.They dont venerate the Caretakers in any way.They just work very hard to be sure they wont have to make up for lost time after theyre dead.What do you think?he asked.Perhaps a little of all three, I said.Remember your ancestors, dream of your descendants, and work hard while youre living.Itsnice to think the universe has a purposewell, more than one, probably, but at least one of them is about helping humans fulfill their potential as a species.Strong anthropic principle?Dllenahkh murmured.At least medium, I conceded with a smile.And I know that sounds very strange and unscientific, so thank you.Thanks for listening to me.Why wouldnt I listen?You listened to all I had to say about parallel time lines, and that sounded very strange, though scientific.Not strange at all, I disagreed.The Caretakers did some fairly interesting things when they went about collecting their endangered humans.I understand theres a community of Cygnians that say theyre descended from the last survivors of a nuclear winter on Terra.From a parallel time line?Dllenahkh queried, his eyebrows rising with surprise and interest.Must be, and its not only them.All I can say is if any Cygnian tells you theyre a direct descendant of Will Shakespeare, dont be too quick to call them a liar.I stretched out my legs, which had grown almost numb from being tucked under me while I was absorbed in conversation.Dllenahkh also moved into a more relaxed posture, leaning his elbows on his knees.I looked at the slight smile on his face and decided to take advantage.What about you?Are there any similar, unscientific beliefs in your culture?He answered easily, not in the least offended.With respect to ancestors, descendants, and working hard, most certainly.However, there are no Caretakers in our lore.Sadira was always where we started and where we ended, no matter how many years and light years lay between.In a way, the elders of the family are our Caretakers.There is an old saying that no elder can truly die who has a hundred descendants living.Many elders do act as if the larger the pyramid of offspring below them, the better their chances of ascending to some afterlife.They have a hand in arranging every adoption and marriage, divorce and shunning.Family is blood and more than blood.I said nothing.Female Sadiri elders had already answered the call and begun to settle on Cygnus Beta.Some of those elders had a few descendants; most had none.It was particularly satisfying to think of those who had never had children suddenly heading their own clans of adoptees and foreign brides and perhaps, just perhaps, secretly and unscientifically thinking of the ladder they were building to a previously unattainable heaven.Gennea, Falve, Collan, Lauri.Startled, I struggled for a moment to understand the language Dllenahkh was speaking, and then I realized they were names.I held my breath and waited.He continued.My older sister, my younger sister, my younger brother, and my mother.My father, Nahkhen, died many years ago.Also two nieces, a nephew, and one brother in law.Among the living, I can count a sister in law, now remarried, and three cousins, two of my generation and one of my mothers generation, all resident on New Sadira.One second cousin of my generation is here on Cygnus Beta.He bit his lip, looking rueful, then confessed, I know my kin far better now than I ever did.I didnt know what to say, but I had to think of something because the silence was making my throat close up.Theres a small lake in the middle of the park.People go there to light floating candles in memory of their dead.At midnight, they turn off all the park lights so theres nothing but stars and candlelight.I waited fearfully as a few more seconds ticked by, and then he said hoarsely, I think I would like to see that.The long silence that followed was more tolerable, breathable, and peaceful.A thought struck me.Dllenahkh, you told me how Ain was quarantined, but you didnt tell me who did it.Does anyone know?He gave me a slightly surprised look.I was under the impression that most Cygnians give that honor to the Caretakers.You believe it was the Caretakers too?I asked.I was skeptical, not about the Caretakers but that any Sadiri would seriously consider this to be a possibility.As a hypothesis, it has some merit.Ability to manipulate time and space, telepathic influence strong enough to erase memory or inhibit discussion of witnessed eventswe have seen the fledgling versions of those skills both here on Cygnus Beta and among mindship pilots of Naraldis caliber.Why not speculate that humans in the future could do as much and more?Has merit, I repeated mockingly.Just admit itweve turned you into a Cygnian.He got to his feet and extended a hand to help me up from the bench.I accepted the hand, careful to touch only the fingertips and only for a second.He surprised me by taking my other hand and drawing it under his arm to rest near the crook of his elbow so that we looked very much like the other promenading couples.And would that be such a terrible thing to admit?he said in a tone of cheerful surrender.This is my universe, my time, my world.There is no going back to what was.There is only the future.We had more than two hours till midnight, plenty of time to walk the length and breadth of the park before a pause to visit the lakes small boardwalk and crouch there to light several candles.Dllenahkh looked at them as they floated away to twinkle amid a growing constellation of tiny lights in the lakes center, then gazed up at the stars.I thought I knew what he was seeking.The newer arrivals always did itlooked for the light, actual or imagined, of their home star.I wonder how long it will be before starlight shines on Sadira once more, he said quietly.I stopped breathing for a moment, a surge of pity seizing my heart.On Cygnus Beta, mentioning a recent disaster in detail is taboo.It is referred to obliquely, delicately, in general terms like the great war or the big wave.The Sadiri had fallen into that habit with swift gratitude, and not once had I heard them specify how Sadira had been laid waste.Not until that moment, when Dllenahkh looked to the sky and acknowledged the world girdling poisonous cloud that covered Sadira in perpetual night.We walked, rested, and walked again, but just before midnight we came back to the lake and waited for the lights off.When it came, it was as remarkable as the holos Id seen and more.The moonless night pressed on the eyes like thick, heavy felt, making the small flames sear the vision as they danced on the dark water.The stars added their cold fire overhead, and yet the night remained dim enough to hide my attempts to dash away tears.Of course I spoiled it by blowing my nose, but there were other sighs and rustles and coping noises in the respectful but imperfect silence, so I did not feel completely alone.Dllenahkh was perfectly silent and absolutely still, though he did clear his throat at one point.When the lights came back on, we left the park and found transportation to the hotel.He bade me good night at my door, and with neither prior thought nor self consciousness, I stretched up to kiss his cheek quickly.He gave me a searching look, then gently brushed his forefinger along my cheekbones to the corner of each eye, wiping away the slight moisture my furtive swipes had missed earlier.The tender gesture almost made me tear up again.Sleep well, Grace, he said in farewell before he turned away to his own door.I went into my room feeling a bit dreamy.It lasted all of three minutes, up until the moment the bathroom door opened to reveal Lian, yawning and dressed for bed.Its all yours, Lian started to say, then got a good look at me.Hmm.What?Lian shrugged.Im a fan of the kohl myself, but I forgot to warn youdont wear it on Remembrance Day or at any event where you might be crying.Youre a bitsmudged.Good night.Zero hour plus one year ten months six days Dllenahkh walked the short distance to his own room.He felt at peace, at peace with his sorrow and fear and loneliness, and it was such a new sensation that he held it carefully, observing it curiously, wondering how long it would last and whether he could call it back the next time he had to face the things he did not wish to remember.The moment of introspection was too brief.He found his door ajar and the light on.He entered his room with caution to see Joral, worried, and Sergeant Fergus, drunk.Resigned, he braced himself for unpleasantness.Sergeant Fergus insisted on waiting to speak to you, Joral said nervously.It wont take long, sir, Fergus said, his speech still clear but with an edge of belligerence that warned Dllenahkh to be careful.Very well, Sergeant.I am listening.Dllenahkh did not close the door.Fergus looked at it and hesitated, but Dllenahkh merely walked farther in, removed his jacket, and tossed it onto the rooms only chair.He then sat on the bed and began to take off his boots.The sergeant took the hint and began to talk quickly.Its about Kirtahsg.Ive been following the case, and its not going well.Dllenahkh straightened up and paid attention.To his chagrin, he had not given any recent thought to the Kirtahsg situation.Fergus continued.The governments been dealing with the children, but they havent gone after the cartels.They say thats a galactic matter.He paused uncertainly.Theyve filed a complaint with the Galactic Judiciary, but Dllenahkh felt unexpectedly embarrassed.These things take time, Sergeant, even more now than previously.I thoughtif you knew someone Fergus muttered.I have sent my own report to the Galactic Judiciary via our Council, Dllenahkh said quietly.I am afraid I have no further influence at that level.The explosion was anticipated, but it still made both Sadiri jump when Fergus began to shout.You set yourselves up as the incorruptible guardians of the galaxy.You created a system where everyone had to go to you.Now youre holding on to that power with aa hollow government and a skeleton fleet.It isnt right!Someone has to stop pretending!Instinctively, Dllenahkh mentally reached out to brace Joral, an unnecessary act given the sergeants low psi levels and Jorals improved steadiness.He bent his mind to Fergus instead.Sergeant, it is late, he suggested.We must not disturb the other guests.We must not disturb the Commissioner.Fergus looked around in sudden fear as if expecting to see Dr.Daniyel standing in the doorway, but he immediately caught himself and turned back.Youre influencing me, he accused.Hardly, said Dllenahkh with complete honesty.I am only appealing to your common sense.You know we can discuss this in the morning.Still suspicious, Fergus glanced at the open door again.Another time, then, he said unwillingly.When he left, a few tense, silent seconds passed, and Joral let go a held breath.Nicely done, Councillor, he said with admiration.A light and skillful touch.Close the door as you go, Joral, Dllenahkh replied, too ashamed to accept the compliment.Joral bid him a subdued good night and went to his own room.Dllenahkh prepared for bed, his movements automatic.They had been given so much sympathy for so long that the sergeants rage was disorienting.Were there others who had stopped feeling sorry for the stricken Sadiri and were instead beginning to question their place and purpose?What did Fergus expect him to do for Kirtahsg when it took all his efforts to keep the young men of his own settlement from despair and self destruction?And yetwho could help Kirtahsg now if the Sadiri were too busy surviving to arbitrate the lives of others?He lay in darkness for several minutes, asking himself unanswerable questions.He knew only one thing: his brief equilibrium was a ruin, and his dreams would only mirror that brokenness.Soon he was once more outside Delaruas room, this time leaning tiredly against the door frame as he knocked.She came to the door, looking rumpled and sleepy, and he quickly straightened, unsure what to say but relieved that she was there.It charmed him to see that they were dressed similarly for bed, in trousers and tunic.He wondered what she would say if she could read his mind.Would it amuse or vex her to learn that although he thought she had looked very pretty all dressed up for the concert, he preferred her like this, in her usual unstudied simplicity of body and mind?She took him in with one glance.Oh.Bad night?It could be, he confessed.She stepped back.Come in.THE LAST ASSIGNMENT It should be obvious by now that Im not good at dealing with change.Id settled into my new role on the mission team.I probably knew more about the Sadiri both on  and off planet than any other Cygnian.My friendship with Dllenahkh was as strong, comfortable, and close as it was kiss free (which is to say completely, but like I said, kissing isnt everything).Id finally restored a level of routine to my life, and I simply could not bend my mind to consider that the mission would be over in a couple of weeks.Everyone else had a job and a life to return to.I should have been making plans for my future.I wasnt.I was hiding from uncertainty by immersing myself in the excitement of our final visit.Wed saved the strangest for last.The taSadiri had settled mainly in the equatorial and tropical belts, keeping to a warm climate whenever possible.It was what they were best adapted to, and the Sadiri are nothing if not traditional and practical.The last settlement on the schedule was the most distant, sited on a peninsula barely clear of the polar regions.We traveled by air and set down near a fjord under the shadow of a large, low volcano.When I stepped out, braced for the worst in my insulated jacket and hood, I slowed in shock.Stinks, said Lian, exiting close behind me.Hot, I said in utter surprise, lowering my hood and unsealing my jacket.And it was.The waters of the fjord steamed, and the atmosphere was a curious mix of warm, heavy air and puffs of sharp, icy wind.The landscape was treeless, sloping down the narrow inlet with a cradling effect and alternating between green lichen and black basalt.Nasiha, Tarik, and Joral exited from the jump jet looking ambivalent, unimpressed by the fluctuating heat and humidity but curious at the idea that Sadiri would have chosen to live in such a place.Fergus, who had been piloting, stuck his head out and sniffed the air suspiciously.You sure you know where youre going?Quite sure, Sergeant, said Nasiha calmly, making slow, sweeping movements with her geosensor.All we need to do is find the entrance.She deserved to feel a bit complacent.It had been her hard work and brilliance, and Tariks too of course, that had uncovered this place from the various legends and folktales theyd diligently collected in every settlement and town wed visited.A little cross checking with the records of the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Resources and the Polar Exploration Institute had borne fruit that would be worth at least one paper, maybe two.The taSadiri settlement had been underground, sheltered from the extreme weather, running on geothermal energy, and thus still the right temperature to remind them of home.Of course, this was a scientific expedition, not a diplomatic one.The settlement had been unpopulated for centuries.The Commissioner and the Councillor were back in Tlaxce, already bogged down in interviews with Cygnian and Sadiri media and meetings with representatives of global, interplanetary, and galactic bodies.That left us to have the funand it was fun.Of all the places Id been to, this was the one that I took care to record with my comm.Id probably never be this far north again in my life.Over there.Tarik pointed.It looked like rock at first, but it was a regular, man made structure, built low and strong against the wind into the hillside.We found a door at the side, half sunk into the ground with steps going down, like the entrance to a bunker.When we entered, the lights came on.I felt first disorientation, then vertigo.Do we all go down?asked Joral doubtfully, hitching a large, bulky bag higher up on one shoulder.Tarik examined the small elevator like structure hanging suspended in the center over an unfathomably deep mine shaft.The carrying capacity is more than adequate.However, there are also emergency chutes at the circumference if you prefer.Joral turned to examine them as Tarik pointed them out.He blinked.They were narrow tubes of some transparent material, even more claustrophobia inducing than the main lift.No, he said quickly.No, that will not be necessary.Tarik turned to Nasiha.There is no need for you to come with us.So you have already told me, she said.You have my response on that matter.Further discussion at this stage is Then at least grant me this.You will return to the surface immediately if I consider it to be too dangerous.I was impressed.I had never heard Tarik interrupt Nasiha before.That sounds reasonable, she admitted reluctantly.I looked away from them to hide my smile.The ride down was long, dark, and filled with ominous creaking sounds, but I wasnt too worried as I knew this technology was a relatively recent addition by the Mineral Resources people.Nasiha led us out of the lift to the rim of the single pool of light around the shaft.Pale lights came up and slowly strengthened as she tapped access codes into her comm.Joral opened his bag and handed out hard hats with miners lightsold, solid technology but with a few modern additions like built in nav and emergency oxygen generators.I put mine on gladly and vidded myself with my wrist comm looking all adventurer like while Lian laughed at me.Where do we go?asked Joral, and it was a good question, because the mines lights illuminated at least six different paths leading away to God knows where in the vastness.Nasihas reply was reassuringly prompt and confident.This way.She led us for half an hour along a path with damp, dripping rock above and around.The water was warm, and I couldnt help but feel that there must be some pools nearby worth soaking in, fed by hot springs and rich with minerals.Decadent taSadiri of this austere outpost kicking back in their hot tubs while the weather above them went to subzeroI could picture it.We turned away from the lights onto a less even path, scrambled through a few narrow places, and then we were there.It was worth it!Id missed seeing Piedra in real life, so I had no comparison, but as far as cities carved out of sheer rock go, this was damned impressive.I hurt my neck swiveling around trying to get my headlight to capture the full scope of an arch that was two stories high and bracketed by windows that hinted at rooms within the rock.The arch itself led into a cathedral of a passageway, with more windows high in the walls and arched doorways a little above path level, their steps crumbling as if eroded by running water.I could imagine the subterranean street lit by cool, pale lamps during the night and warm, bright lamps in the day.Greenhouses near the surface were a possibility, Nasiha had said, close enough to take advantage of skylights but deep enough to tap into the earths heat.Rivers and inlets were filled with fish adapted to living underground, feeding on algae swept in by the tides of the fjord.A glitter caught my eye, and I went closer to see the muted sheen of crystal in the rock, not excavated but incorporated into the carvings of the door lintel.It was a rich place, an unexpected Eden.Why was it deserted?Tarik approached one set of steps more closely and beckoned us over.Look, he said.The path has risen.We are walking on the remnants of a lava flow.That put my vivid imagination to work in a less pleasant area.I imagined the street illuminated with a hellish red, oozing past doors and trapping people inwait a minute.Tarik, was this place abandoned before the lava came through?Did they find any remains?I asked.He nodded approvingly at the question.None.They must have had warning of the eruption and evacuated to some other place.Then, when they returned, they found it uninhabitable.I understood what he meant when the path went sharply upward, allowing us to walk along the level of the first story windows and then past them until the ceiling of the tunnel stopped us.Who knows how much more lies under that rock, Lian said wonderingly.Lian had also missed seeing Piedra.How do you know for certain that taSadiri lived here?This is similar to the stone carving of Piedra, and some of the symbols here can also be found in ancient Sadiri texts, Joral explained.However, there may have been other We froze.There was a sudden scuttling patter that made me think uncomfortably of giant spidersmy own fault for having watched preholo monster movies with Joral and Lian two nights previously.Rockfall, said Nasiha crisply after the echoes had died away.Small earthquakes are common in this area.It is nothing to be concerned about.I would have believed her in an instant, but Tarik was frowning and checking his geosensor.Seismic data from the mines sensors do indicate that caution may be advisable.How much longer do you need to record The path beneath us fell away ten centimeters or so, then surged higher, leaving us first stumbling and then gasping on our knees.We go now, Tarik ordered, clipping his geosensor to his belt and seizing hold of his wifes arm.Nasiha tried to collect herself.Wait, the Good idea, Lian interrupted briskly.We staggered out, disoriented by the occasional vibration of the ground and the wavering shadows as our headlights bobbed.Thats how I ran into Tariks back.What is it?Joral asked sharply.There was no answer, and for a moment I wondered hysterically if the way was blocked and he was afraid to tell us, but then, one by one, we turned and squinted up through the dust, half unsure about what we were seeing.Everyone, turn off your lights, Tarik commanded.Far from the mines lamps and with our own lights out, it was obvious.There was a slender beam of illuminated dust, as if someone had cracked open a window several stories up.But were so far down, Lian murmured in awe.A light well, Nasiha said.Another part of the city must have been opened by the earth tremor.Lian switched a light back on and swept it along the ground leading to the beam.The terrain was steep but passable.You guys stay here.Well scout ahead, see if theres anything worth investigating.I dithered, trying to decide whether I wanted to be classified as a you guys or a we, but as Joral followed Lian, curiosity got the better of me.With an apologetic glance back at Nasiha, I scrambled to catch up with them.When I arrived, out of breath, at the source of the light, they were crouched beside the gap, staring transfixed.I huddled in to take a peek and saw a huge cavern lit by massive tubes of mirror and glass.Some were dim and darkperhaps covered over by earth where they were meant to emerge into sunlightbut there were enough tubes still functioning for us to see that the street we had just walked was a mere back alley.This was the heart of the city, its forum magnum.I vidded what I could see and stuck my arm out to vid what I couldnt.Lian began to pull at the rocks around the edge of the gap, trying to clear more space.Lets see if we can get down there.Stair connected balconies ridged the walls of the cavern.Lian went through the gap and carefully climbed down a few meters of rock face to stand on one of them.Im sure thats dangerous, I said nervously.Joral, dont you have some rope in that kit bag?A very good idea, he said, also looking apprehensive.He took out a length of slender cord.Securing one end to a projection of rock, he lowered the other end to Lian, who caught it and hooked it onto a belt loop without comment.Tarik should see this at least, I said.Ill go back and stay with Nasiha so he can come up.I made the switch, consoling Nasiha with some images from my comm vid while Tarik went to examine the find.Then the earth shook again, a long, powerful tremor.I gasped.Lets get out of here, I said to Nasiha.We stumbled a short distance, and then she cried out, Tarik!Delarua!Take Nasiha to the surface now!he shouted back.You promised, I told her, unfairly perhaps, but it had an effect.She let me pull her into a near run as we headed for the main path, and once the way was lit, she outpaced me to the shaft lift.Get in, she snapped.They can use the emergency tubes.I got in.The earth had calmed again, but I felt as if Id had my fill of adventures of this kind.Several different phobias assailed me as we ascended.We were so high upwhat if the lift failed and we fell?What if it got to the top and didnt open, trapping us in a box?What if it failed, fell, and left us to be buried alive in the dark?I breathed deeply, marshaling everything I had learned in meditation practice to keep myself sane.Nasiha had only one fear, and I could read it in her eyes.Tarik will be right behind us, I promised.The lift opened.I grasped Nasihas hand and ran out and up the stairs into the open, not giving her a chance to think about waiting for the others inside that windowless chamber.We collapsed on the hillside, sitting facing the door.Nasiha frowned at her geosensor, then tried her comm, tapping and calling Tariks name, then Jorals, then Lians.There was no response.I am a fool, she whispered, her face bleak.Come on, come on, I muttered at the empty doorway.Youre all okay; youve got to be.A long, agony filled minute later, Tarik came out, coughing and covered in dust.Nasiha went to meet him, took his hands, and seemed to sigh.I ran past them.Lian!Lian?Joral?I whipped back around.Where are they?Tarik looked at me, somber and ashamed.We must call for help.There has been a significant collapse of the exit tunnel.I slapped on my comm.Fergus!Call Emergency Services.We have two missing.By the time we got down to the jump jet, we found that Fergus had called Emergency Services and also managed to contact Lian by using the jets comm.They were both uninjured, but there was no way out.Nasiha scanned the data provided by the Ministry, but to no avail.The newly discovered cavern was unmapped.I tried to be cheerful as I chatted to Lian and Joral.Look on the bright side.Youre in the warm, theres sunlight all around, and youre in the middle of the discovery of the century.Walk around; take some pics and vids for us.Find something Nasiha can write a paper about.As we talked to them, the first team from Emergency Services turned up.They were a small group from a nearby science outpost and they lacked excavation equipment, but they did have all manner of scanning technology to determine the extent of the collapse and figure out where to start digging when the heavy equipment arrived.They also checked us over, giving Nasiha particular attention, then declared us fine and tried to ignore us as we told them everything we knew and a few things we didnt and, frankly, breathed down their necks in a very unhelpful way.The fact that communication is still possible suggests that transponder technology could be used to locate them, Tarik said.I have no doubt that we will locate them in time, the Emergency Services chief explained patiently.The challenge is factoring in the interference from magnetic fluctuations caused by the volcanic activity.He was a pale skinned man, regrettably spare of fat for such a cold climate, and his short frame was made even smaller by the bulkiness of his parka.His eyebrows had a perpetually worried slant that did not reassure.His voice made up for it, though, deliberately slow and slightly soft so that you felt you had to dial down your own hysteria to be able to hear him clearly.But the fact that we can still communicate with them is good, isnt it?I asked.His expression turned wary.It is good in that we may be able to find out roughly where they are so we can plan how to excavate, but theres too much interference for certainty.Lets not get carried away.Well, what about those light tubes?I insisted.Shouldnt we try to find where they come out, maybe use Maam, he said, firmly cutting me off.We appreciate that youre concerned about your friends, but we do know our job.Our networks have been informed, and there are people working to solve the problem.Of course, I said, defeated.Butyou understand why we cant lose them?Especially not Joral.Not now.Not like this.He blew out a breath, looking as if he were trying to choose his next words very carefully.Id like to recommend that you return home as scheduled.To be honest, we cant afford to have nonessential personnel using up our resources.You might be able to do more for your friends by being in Tlaxce than being here.It was a kind but definite brush off, and it meant we had to have a final conversation with Lian and Joral.Theyre kicking us out, I said casually.We have to go back, stop getting in their way and stuff.Lian played along.Well, you know what that means.Cant put your name in the acknowledgments when we make our big discoveries.I laughed, then sobered.About what I said earlier, walking around and so on?Be careful.Conserve your resources.I know Jorals got a thing or two in the bag, but Delarua, I am a corporal, you know, said Lian, gently teasing.I didnt forget all my survival training when they made me a pencil pusher.To replace you, I might add.My laugh was a little too close to a sob, so I cut it short.Yeah, man, sorry about that one.So Ill be seeing you later, okay?I waited for Tarik and Nasiha to finish speaking with Joral, and then I started a conversation in rapid Sadiri so that Lian would not understand.Joral, I know that if you remember all that Councillor Dllenahkh has taught you, your chances of survival are excellent.Delarua, I have considered this.I know it will be more difficult for someone who has not been trained in psychosomatic control.I am not sufficiently advanced in the disciplines to exert this control beyond my own body, but I will at least ensure that our colleague consumes more food and water than I do.I smiled at his careful efforts not to attract attention by using Lians name.Joral, I hope that it will not be necessary for you to deny yourself what little food and drink you have, but I know that whatever you choose to do, you will choose well.Time to treat the boy like a man.Heaven knows he deserved it by now.When the jump jet took off, we all gazed down at the land we were leaving.I couldnt guess what everyone was feeling at that point, but I bet Fergus was thinking that if he had been underground with us, he could have done something.As for myself, I was damping down my emotions, that thing Im so very good at, and scrutinizing the slopes for any flash of glass or metal that might suggest a protruding light tube.I saw none.A few minutes into the flight, we called Qeturah and Dllenahkh and updated them.An hour later, we arrived at our stop over point, changed, ate, and switched from the jump jet to a slower but more comfortable shuttle.At first it seemed natural to talk a bit about the old underground city and what new discoveries might be made there, but as we monitored the bulletins from Emergency Services, the journey grew quieter and quieter.The revised time to reach Lian and Joral was no longer being given in hours but in days.When we arrived in Tlaxce City that evening, there was still no good news.The small welcoming ceremony at Central Government Headquarters had been quietly called off, and all that remained of the end of mission reception were a few napkin covered plates of assorted finger foods.In case we were hungry, Qeturah said in an offhand fashion as we filed into her office, but I saw eight plates on her meeting room table and a dying hope in her eyes.I couldnt blame her.Id half expected to step off the shuttle and find that Lian and Joral were fine and at home, flown ahead at supersonic speed just to surprise us.Dllenahkh seemed depressed, but in a healthy way, if that makes any sense.From the questions he asked us, I knew he was trying to convince himself that nothing would have happened any differently if he had been there.It was nobodys fault, Dllenahkh, I said wearily.Nobodys or everybodys, take your pick.This isnt a postmission debriefing, Qeturah said hastily.Were not in the frame of mind for that.She glared at Dllenahkh and added pointedly, None of us.This iswell, even if we couldnt have a proper homecoming, I wanted us to meet one last time.I was miserable but strangely glad to be there, because I didnt want to be miserable alone and there wasnt anyone else I wanted to be miserable with.We werent grieving for Lian and Joral.We were worried about them, but we still had hopes of seeing them very soon.We were dealing with the fact that the mission was over, that the life we had made ours for a year was not the life we would be facing on the morrow.Not having Lian and Joral there only emphasized how much we were going to miss one another.I blinked back tears so many times that I had to excuse myself to go to the ladies room to have a proper nose blow and wash my face.When I returned, Fergus was standing outside Qeturahs office door.He was speaking into his comm as I approached, but by the time I reached him he had finished the call and was staring oddly at the device in his hand.Curiosity overrode my initial intent to nod and pass by.What is it, Sergeant?At first he didnt look at me.That was Lian.Just wanted to make sure wed made it back to the city okay.Then he met my eyes, and we exchanged a brief sympathetic look of shared pain before he remembered he didnt like me and looked away again.I cant believe the range those comms I started, then froze in midsentence, struck by something.He gave me his usual lowering frown.
