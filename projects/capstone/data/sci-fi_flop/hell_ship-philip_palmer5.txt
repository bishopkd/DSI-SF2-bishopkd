I turned to her.Her eyes were open; shed          emerged from trance.I am smashed, I said, extravagantly, sozzled, delirious, and delighted!It was a stupid thing to say; and I said it in an extremely stupid fashion.And after Id said it, Albinia stared at me for          a long while, clearly baffled at my idiocy.Then she giggled.I offered to leave of course, after the giggle moment, but Albinia insisted that I stay.And so I stayed, and we talked, surrounded by stars, as she plucked absent mindedly at the cable that led out of her skull.We talked about aliens wed encountered, and about missions, successful and unsuccessful, and about other members of the crew.Albinia knew the biographies of every crew member.I knew most of them by their first names from card games and drinking bouts,          but she knew their full names including the matronymic and their professional and personal histories and she told me it all.I listened, an expression of rapt interest pinned to my face.Are you bored?she asked abruptly.Not in the least, I protested.You say something.I would be delighted so to do.Go on then.Shall I tell you, I said, expansively, of the time when I was trapped in a cloud on the planet of Unplug me, she whispered, urgently, cutting off my words.Im sorry?Please.Id like to get up and stretch my legs.I was startled at her request; but I reached over and gently eased the plug out of her skull; a curiously intimate act.Thank you, she said softly.You cant bear to do it yourself, can you?I said, with dawning comprehension.Disconnect yourself?Albinia blinked, clearly disorientated at being fully in a human body.I do find itan effort of will, she admitted.Galamea          makes me spend an hour in the gym, twice a day.But there are brain plugs there too.Its only at meal times that I amnaked.She touched her skull holes self consciously.Here, take a walk with me, I said.I changed the settings on the panoramic wall screen; we were in a park now, the sun was shining, and there was a lake.Albinia got up from her chair, carefully stretching her limbs.Her bald head gleamed in the muted evening lighting.We promenaded around the Control Hub for several minutes; I held her arm in mine.She was, I noted, a little wobbly on her          feet.Look, she whispered, confidingly.She showed me what was in her hand; it was her skull plate, that she used to cover the holes in her head on social occasions.It holds a wirefree, she admitted.You wear this when youre not connected to Explorer?When I wear this, I am connected to Explorer.She smiled, like a child confessing a wicked secret; and she slipped the skull plate back into place, covering the holes.It was a silver oval, almost the same shape in miniature as her shapely head.Her eyes sparkled as the contact was made; Explorer was back in her brain.I found myself kissing her; I have no idea how that happened.We went back to my room, and fornicated for several hours.Albinia was a passionate lover, and it was a pleasure to bring her to climax.I felt curiously detached however; for I hardly          knew this woman I was so skilfully orgasming.Because this wasnt the Albinia I loved; it was the in trance Albinia who          captivated me.This Albinia, the real one, was just a shy awkward creature, oddly young in her ways, and emotionally needy          to a degree that terrified me.But I copulated her competently enough, then she fell asleep in my arms.And when she woke up she was crying and I had to          ask her why; and then she told me what was wrong with her.I fear that Ive lost my olarinity, said Albinia.I stroked her naked breast, and she shuddered.Her skin was warm, I could still taste the aroma of her soft flesh on my lips.You dont believe me, she said.I dont believe you.I can see, she said, and held a hand out in front of her, the galaxies unfolding.I can hear the beat of pulsing stars,          I can touch the pull of gravity well stars, I can count supernovae in a single glance and I can smell the carbon and the iron          and the uranium in the clouds of matter circling each and every star in my sightline.I touched her cheek with my fingers, and kissed her temples.Feel that too?I feel that too.Youre Olaran.Some of the time.I touched her skull plate, with its wirefree link to Explorers brain.I was somewhat shocked by it, in truth, for Id never          heard of such a thing.Then cut the link.Turn off Explorer, exist in the here and now.I cant.Youre supposed to.Its not customary to be permanently connected.Its surely in breach of safety protocols.I dont care.I love it too much.I am the ship, the ship is me.I just fucked a ship?Well, yes.That makes me feel, I said, odd.And, to my delight, she giggled again.Heres a truth I learned at an early age: females are not like males.When I was twelve years old my six year old sister explained to me the fundamental principles of Olaran science.I had no          idea what she was talking about, despite my several years of school.But she had accessed a single memory file and had learned          it all, instinctively.She could do mathematics the way I could throw a ball.But she could also throw a ball further and          more accurately than I ever could.When I was sixteen years old I was given a degree in astrophysics with a distinction, and was considered to be one of the brightest students in my all male class.But my sister, by this point,          was building suns, with the help of a mind machine link with the Olaran computer.Her intellect so far surpassed mine that          I marvelled at our memories of being kids together, playing in a pool in the garden, creating imaginary friends.But Albinia was the first female who ever explained to me the negative side of having such effortless intellectual proficiency.Since she was ten years old she had been cyber linked with a computer or robot for large parts of her waking day.And so shed          grown up awkward, clumsy, and not at ease in her own body.Males terrified her, and the fact that all the males she met treated          her as a superior being terrified her even more.All my life Ive known I could have any male I wanted, with a click of my fingers, said Albinia, trying but failing to click          her fingers.And a lot of my girlfriends did just that.They fucked their way through college and carried on screwing around          in their twenties.What was there to lose?Pregnancy is volitional these days, males are getting more and more beautiful,          and the sexual congress is officially an artform.But I hated it.Poor little powerful girl, I said withor so I realised in the retrospect of a moment latera hint of bitterness.Every male Ive been with behaves like a servant.I never feel relaxed.I always feel in charge.I remembered Galameas words on the dark world and, for the first time, I began to doubt my understanding of my own species.Females are natural leaders, I said tactfully.Have you ever been treated as an equal?By a female?No, I lied.We fucked again that night, and when I reached the moment of her orgasm she stopped and she looked into my eyes.And she cupped          my head in her hands.And she transferred her consciousness into me, from her skull plate into my brain dot.And then we carried on fucking.And this time, I wasnt me, servicing my goddess.I was her; I felt the heat of Jaks skin, the hardness of his body, I felt his cocks inside me, and I saw it too, with my Explorer part;          saw the two naked coupling bodies from the cameras in the wall, and then I was in the Command Hub watching the stars on the          screen and I was also outside the ship, I was looking at Explorer/myself thorough space cameras, and I was travelling through          space, and my telescopic and spectrographic and electromagnetic vision allowed me to zoom close to any sun I desired and feel          the soft caress of its interstellar matter on my body.I was no longer myself; I was Albinia; I was Explorer; I was everywhere; and data swirled around me and I knew it without          thinking.And when Albinia achieved her orgasm, I felt it too, and the ship shuddered, and the engines roared.Afterwards we lay silently and nakedly entwined.How was that?asked Albinia.Lets, I said, do it again.Commence to rift, please, I said, and unreality descended upon us all in the Hub; on Morval, Galamea, Albinia, Phylas and          myself.As the rifting process began, I kept my eyes carefully focused on the star screen, and on my work.I did not, thanks to my          exceptional self control, digress in my purpose by looking at Albinia: the cable trailing from her skull like a leash, her          absorbed and haunted features, her distantly staring eyes, her twitching lips.Though in truth I wanted to look at her so          much; so extraordinarily much.And indeed, I did, just for a moment, sneak a peek!For I loved, I realised, both Albinias now.The real one that I had fornicated with so beautifully that night; and the other          one, the trance Albinia who I knew on the Hub; a beautiful child lost in dreams.Improbability is Phylas started to say.But suddenly Albinia screamed.It was a scream of pure hysteria and it shocked us all.And the ship rocked and shook, as she          broke her link with Explorer.We were flying through un space without a Star Seeker!Operating manual controls, said Morval swiftly, as he took control of the vessel from Albinia/Explorer.He eased us back          into reality.The Command Hub flipped and flipped again, until the walls and ceiling were whirling around us in our fixed          points, held by the stay still.Then finally we were back in real space.I broke the stay still with a murmur link command, and hurried across the room to          Albinia.Her face was twisted with pain.I reached for her cable.That could be traumatic, Morval warned.I touched Albinias face; she opened her eyes; she saw me and smiled.I wrenched the cable out.She sighed with huge relief; and was herself again.What is wrong Star Seeker?I asked, appalled at the look of emptiness in her eyes.I saw, she said, another world come to a terrible end.The genocided aliens in this case were the Maibos; a species of artificers, and we had done a great deal of business with          them.The Maibos had built for us some of our most magnificent furnishings and tapestries.They were an entirely non violent species;          it was a miracle they had survived so long.The Maibos had constantly refused all offers from Olara to equip them with a space          defence system.And they refused to heed our argument that this is, and always has been, a viciously violent universe.But the Maibos held to their faith, that violence begets violence; whereas a spirit of peace and love will spread and possess all those who encounter it.They called it the contagion          of joy.And in this delightful faith they were proved entirely wrong.For these peace loving creatures were invaded and exterminated          like bugs.All of them died; all.Not one Maibos remained, except for the handful who dwelled at the embassy of the Olaran Home Court.And even their planet was destroyed; shattered and exploded into many parts, just as had happened to the planet of the FanTangs.And to salt and sting the wound, un matter bombs were flown into their sun, sending it into a flaring frenzy; it was now poised          to turn nova.We knew all this because, in the dying moments of their civilisation, the Maibos had found a way to transmit space camera          images of their demise through rift space, on what they knew were Olaran frequencies.This is what Albinia had seen through her Explorer link.The end of a world; the planet of the Maibos sundering; billions          of gracious, honourable creatures perishing even faster than their own ideals.It was an image of horror that had seared her          mind.It was a shocking holocaust and all Olarans mourned for the lost Maibos.But the good news was that this time there had been a sighting.An Olaran scout vessel had viewed the foul slayer of the Maibos          as it had fled the planetary system.And according to this reliable report, there was no fleet, no alien armada; just a single vessel, with black sails.Its the Magrhediera, Morval speculated.They escaped from their planet and they are taking revenge on us.The ship doesnt conform to any of the Magrhediera designs, I pointed out.And its not their style; they burn biospheres,          then colonise; these creatures are killing actual planets.The Stuxi?asked Galamea.It could be a rogue Stuxi ship, I conceded.Their planet is Quarantined; but it just takes one vessel to keep a war going.The Stuxi are ruthless bastards, Galamea said.We all knew her past history with these creatures; we preserved a tactful          silence.The Navy will find them, said Phylas.And that will be that.He was clearly comforted at this vision of the remorseless          power of the Olaran military.There may be other vessels, I worried.One ship, said Morval.Its just one ship.Against the entire Olaran Fleet.Its just a matter of time before one of our          vessels finds it, and crushes it.We were nowhere near the Maibos system, and there was nothing we could do to help.And so we continued with our exploration          of the farthest stretches of the furthest galaxies.And every night Albinia came to my bed and we had sex.And afterwards we talked; and sometimes, she would let me be Explorer          again.And we became close.We even became, dare I say it, friends.In the days however I continued to worship her, as my goddess and inspiration, as she, in her dreamy trance state, steered          and flew and lived through our ship.And, as it happens, I was at this time also spending a good deal more time with Phylas.He was determined to be a Trader,          so I tried to teach him some tricks.He was however, I concluded regretfully, after several role play exercises, too easygoing and nice to haggle; and he had no          flair for deception and manipulative body language.However, I persevered; he was a dumb and sweet kid and the universe needed more of those, in my view.And also, around about this timeI remember it well!Morval and I discovered and explored a fascinating planet, which we christened          Gem, that was populated by microbes and rich in jewels.The diamonds were clearly visible in the rocks, there were rubies,          there were mountains made of gold.We spent a month running sentience tests on the bacteria and viruses who comprised this          planets only biosphere, before concluding that they were just stupid bugs and we had the right to claim this planet for Olara.Galamea toasted our success with champagne; all the ships officers would get a small percentage of the profits from this          planet in perpetuity.It was our pension plan.But then, just a week after the champagne toasting, we saw it; the ship with black sails.Or rather, Explorer did.I have a located a telling trace, said Explorer.Tell us more, said Commander Galamea.We were all in the Command Hub; Albinias eyes were wide open, and clearly she too was shocked at Explorers decision to speak          to us all directly, rather than via her.A vessel is travelling this sector via rift space; there are visuals.An image appeared on our panoramic wall screen, of a black sailed vessel with a cylindrical hull.Is this I began to say.This is the vessel that destroyed the FanTangs, said Explorer.There was a sober silence.Send the coordinates to the Navy, said Galamea.They may rift at any moment, I pointed out.We should tag them.If we get too close theyll fire on us, Galamea pointed out.Do we care?Galamea smiled.We do not.Explorer, pursue, and prepare for battle.Were in for a father fucker of a fight.Albinia was living in the rift; she could smell the tang of the shifting sands as Explorer soared through the cracks of reality          that connect one part of the universe with another.And Albinia/Explorer could feel and smell and hear and touch the enemy ship as it tried to escape.She sensed too that there was something strange about the ship, yet she could not at first find words to describe it.Then, as Explorer later explained it to me, the words came to Albinia: She could smell Death upon this ship.These were creatures who to our certain knowledge had destroyed two entire planets and all who dwelled on them.These were          creatures who could blow up suns.These were creatures who had massacred the citizens of an entire Olaran Trading Post and          left them as corpses for the birds to pick at, except that all the birds had died and no creature was left to scavenge.The enemy ship was Death, it wrought Death, it savoured Death; but, Albinia resolved, soon it too would die.Explorer/Albinia flew through the final rift and there it was, the Death Ship, waiting for her, and for us.Do we know anything about these creatures?I asked.We have no records of a ship of this kind, said Phylas.The materials of the hull are unfamiliar.The elements of which the materials are made areunfamiliar.How strange is that?I asked.Fairly strange, Phylas conceded.Axial theory accepts three different classes of elements, the Real, the Unlikely, and          the Never to be Dreamed Of.This ship is made of other stuff entirely.It may be from a different universe, said Morval.I scoffed.Not that old myth again.I dont believe in other universes.Thats because you know no transdimensional science, sneered Morval.I dont need to; thats your job, to remember the dull stuff, I mocked.Morval bridled at the insult.The enemy ship had a cylindrical hull that was scratched, and covered in chaol, a space dwelling parasitical life form.High          black sails loomed above the hull; their purpose, Phylas explained, was probably to gather dark matter and use it as an energy          source.Explorer drifted closer, invisible in all wavelengths and heavily shielded.The enemy ship was still.It seemed to drift through the darkness of space like an idle thought in a blank mind.How many crew?I asked.Our sensors cant penetrate the hull, said Phylas.On the count of three, fire missiles, flit anti matter bombs, release energy beams.Then when weve done that, switch on          the Quarantine cage; well trap the parent fuckers inside a box full of detonating explosives.I said.Agreed, said Galamea.One I began.Explorer rocked and shook.Theyve hit our shields, said Phylas.No weapon was fired, said Morval.Then we saw on the screen the tell tale shadows of missiles in flight.The missiles struck before they were fired, theorised Phylas.Theyre using some kind of time reversal mechanism.I froze at the implications of that.Morval didnt wait for the rest of the count; he pulled the sliders on his phantom control display to flit the anti matter          bombs.Our flitting technology can cut through any force shield; one moment the bombs were on our weapons deck, the next they were          inside the enemy vessel.And so the black sailed ship spun madly in space, as if beset by fierce winds, as the bombs exploded inside its hull.The          hull itself cracked, spewing air and bodies into space.And the sails collapsed, as their energy supply was compromised, and          they dangled helplessly in vacuum.Meanwhile, real space missiles surged forth from Explorer and, ten minutes later, cut through the enemys force shields with          ease and detonated on its hull, shattering it further.It cant be that easy, I said.Watch, said Albinia.She could see the ship as Explorer saw it, on our panoramic wall screen.And she knew, with a chilling          certainty, that something strange was happening.And then it happened.The shards of the enemy ship began to reform.The two parts of the hull rejoined; the sails refurled.Nice trick, conceded Phylas.Quarantine cage?I said.Activated, said Morval.Another missile exploded on our force shields.And another.The stay still fields kept us safe, but the Hub was rocking wildly          with each impact.Quarantine the bastards!!I screamed.And so the battle raged: the Death Ship continued to hurl missiles at us, and the missiles continued to splash hopelessly          against our invincible shields.And meanwhile we cast a quarantine lattice through space to envelop the black sailed monstrosity.Within moments the battle would be over.Then our fields failed, and a missile crashed through our hull.The impact on our ship was devastating: the hull cracked; air billowed out into space; our wireboards exploded, and the lights          flickered wildly.But in the Hub we saw none of that.The stay stills kept us in place.The armoured doors protected us from all blast impacts.Our wireboards were shielded and discrete.And we could if necessary survive for centuries in this Hub even if the rest of          the vessel were destroyed.Evacuate lower deck crew into pods, ordered Galamea.No one has ever done that much damage to an Olaran vessel before, marvelled Morval.I began to worry we had got ourselves into a fight we couldnt win.Albinia, report, I said.Explorer is hurt; the sheer drive is damaged; we are using spare rift support engines, she replied.The black sailed ship vanished from our screen.Its rifting, said Phylas.We have it tagged.We rifted too and found ourselves almost on top of the Death Ship; and we rained more missiles on it.And then it vanished, once again.And again we tagged it.And so the battle was waged: our two damaged ships flickered in and out of space, landing occasional blows upon each other          in the form of powerful beams of energy that smashed against energy absorbing shields.Albinia relied on her powerful intuition          to guide her in her rift leaps and most of the time she made Explorer reappear within missile range of the enemy, and we struck.Phylas and Morval were marshalling the barrage of energy beams, which collided with invisible barriers but, with each repulsion, stole data about what was within.They also used the disuptor ray in short bursts; but the Death Ships shields          bore up against it.Then I flickerflew a black hole from Explorers inner cage and it rematerialised within the enemy ship.The ships image wavered,          as the gravity well began to rip at its very fabric.Then the enemy ship vanished, rifting away with incredible skill, and the black hole was left behind, bending space around          it, a pinprick with the gravitational pull of a red giant.And the enemy ship was below us now and Explorer began to shake.Every atom of our vessel was in motion.The enemy were trying          to shake us to death with a weapon unlike any we had ever encountered.I opened the bomb hatch and Albinia rifted Explorer away, and when Explorer reappeared in real space we were able to see a          flock of missiles explode as one in the space where we had been.And then the black sailed ship vanished again and we rifted          after it.After another hour of battle, we scored another hit: the enemy ship was smitten by a mighty energy blow, and its hull was          dented, but this time it didnt tear.But within instants our own hull was smashed with a mighty fist, and air began venting          out again.How are they managing to penetrate our shields?asked Galamea calmly.I thought that was impossible.Theyregood, I said.Wait, whispered Morval.But even so, were beating the fornicators!I roared, as I saw their hull began to rip apart once more.Its rifting again, screamed Phylas.Continue pursuit, I said.The black sailed ship slipped through a rift in space; but once again we flew with it.We emerged in a different part of space;          and the battle continued.They rifted again; we went with them.And again.And again.What are they doing?asked Morval baffled.Theyre not fighting; theyre travelling.This continued forhow long?Hours?Or days?We received regular reports from the crew on the fatalities and casualties that          had accrued.But our ship had self healed, the wireboards had regenerated, and our guns were now recharged.We had lost six          brave Olarans but we were battle worthy once again.And finally we found ourselves in a solar system dominated by a large gas giant.The black sailed ship stopped shooting at          us.It seemed to be waiting for something.Our gen guns fired, and fired again.The enemy ships shields were holding up; but it was making no effort whatsoever to avoid          our blasts.Look.Behind.On the wall screen, said Morval.The panoramic wall screen in front of me showed the enemy ship, its hull a blaze of energy as bomb after bomb exploded on          its invisible walls.No, look behind you.Look at the stars, Morval said.I turned around, and looked at the screen behind me, which offered a view of the far distant universe.And I realised that some of the stars were gone.Many remained, but I knew the patterns of the distant galaxies and I could          see the absences as vividly as if they had been coloured flashes of flight.Which stars are gone?I asked.The most distant.More stars vanished.And now many nearer stars too, Morval said.All the stars vanished.And now, said Morval, unnecessarily, all of them.What does this mean?I asked, trying to keep the panic from my voice.The battle is a feint, said Morval.We are not winning, we are losing.In fact, we have already lost.Utterly.The enemy ship accelerated towards us in real space, scattering our space cameras like a farki running through a mob.Energy beams bounced off its hull, and the metal glowed white, but still          the black sailed ship flew, closer and closer to Explorer.Theyre breached our improb wall a second time; theres a bomb inside Explorer, said Albinia, her eyes wide open, terror          in her voice.I think its        Our ship exploded around us.The instruments were shattered into shards, and Albinias body exploded and blood gushed out          of her torso, and I heard her scream, but only once.Morval and Phylas too were ripped into bloody shreds of meat and bone.I was knocked off my feet, and one of my arms was ripped off, and my skin burned, and my legs melted.I dragged myself by          the strength of one arm and hand until I reached Albinias seat.And I tugged myself up.And I touched her cheek, which was          cold.And I took her pulse, and there was none.She was dead.All systems failing, said Galamea.Help me, I said.I pushed the dead body of Albinia aside with one hand, and sat in her seat.I ripped the cable out of her          skull, and clumsily tried to attach it to myself, but of course I had no skull socket.I cant, said Galamea.I looked.Her lower body had been ripped off, and blood was gushing out of the half torso.You led us well, beloved Mistress, I said formally.Jak, you slippery devilah!And Galamea died.I cut the end off the cable until I bared two spikes; then I thrust them into my skull, so they penetrated my frontal lobe.Blood trickled down my forehead; and suddenly I could see through Explorers eyes.What is happening?I asked.The enemy are possessed of a device that undermines the fabric of reality.It creates a zero probability function; in other             words, it restores this universe to the random chaos that existed before The Moment of The Universes Birth.Theyve destroyed this entire universe?I said, incredulous.This is not their universe.They do not care if it dies.Behold, said Explorer.And as I looked at the single image screen, I saw the enemy ship flickering.Then it vanished.Theyre in rift space?I asked Explorer, with my thoughts.No.There are no rifts left in our entire universe; for there is no universe.They must have passed through a strange kind             of rift that leads elsewhere; which must mean into another universe.How is that possible?I asked.I have no data on that.Can we follow them?The Hub was awash with blood; Albinia was dead at my feet.I had been intending to tell her that I loved her; but I had not          done so.We can emulate their path and rift signature; there may be an entrance to another universe at this location.That is the most             logical conclusion.I had never before felt such a connection with a female.Not with Shonia, not with Averil, no one.There was a vulnerability          to Albinia; I needed that.I needed to know that sometimes, she might need me as I        Another universe?I said, helplessly.That or death are your only options.You should be advised that in fifty three seconds, the un probability wave at the furthest             stretches of this universe will reach us and we will cease to exist.We are, very nearly, the last particle of reality left.Explorer, how do we clear the blood?And the bodies?I cant endure this.The crew are dead.There are no cleaning robots in this part of the ship.The Hub is the only functional area left.You must             wait until these bodies decay; and then I will cleanse them with jets of water from the ceiling and sluice the residue down             runnels in the floor.But this is not relevant.We are the last particle of reality left; what do you want me to do?What are you asking me?Can you bear to live, or would you rather die?Live.I felt my body becoming wrapped in a healing cocoon; I knew that Explorer could keep me alive indefinitely like this, feeding          me and disposing of my wastes without any need for me to leave my pilots seat.The cocoon covered my face; so that I could no longer see with my own eyes, only with Explorers eyes; I could no longer feel          my bodys pain, I could only feel the icy touch of space on Explorers hull.I entered a trance like state; and I ceased to          become me, and I became a part of Explorer.Are you ready?I am ready.A moment later, Explorer and I embraced improbability, and left the universe of the Olara For ever.Sharrock After my encounter with Zala of the Kindred, the slayer of my entire species, I walked away from Sai ias with hate in my heart.And I wondered at what I had become.What indeed had happened to Sharrock the great warrior?I had fought battles in this Hell Ship and lost, and eventually wonbut they were all the wrong battles.For what merit was there in being King of the Kindred?Who was I helping or saving through such an act of braggartry?And yet what other options were there?I could not fight an enemy I could not see.And escape from this ship was, I knew,          impossible.Everyone told me that, and I had of course verified it carefully for myself, by interrogating everyone I met,          and through personal investigations.Thus, I knew we had no access to the engine roomfor though there was one place in the interior world where the throb of motors          could be heard, there was no way to break through the walls.I had tried to cut through the metal, but it was impregnable          to my blade.There were no ventilation shafts; and no hidden corridors or secret passageways of the kind I had been so used          to finding when raiding the palaces of rich aliens or the Southern Tribesfolk.There were no space pods or lifeships we could          steal, and hence no way to survive departure from the ship.I had spent many days in the glass belly of the vessel looking          out at space, and I knew that through the hull hatch I could get access to the world outside; but how long would even Sharrock survive in empty space?So instead of trying to escape I had endeavoured to make a life for myself here.I had smelled the flowers, enjoyed the breeze,          savoured the sun on my cheeks.I had made friends: Sai ias, Cuzco, even Mangan.Mangan was an angry creature but a smart one;          his blind rage was his way of coping with a terrible situation.Mangans kind, I had been told, were life loving forest dwellers          who on their native world had lived in peace and harmony with others.That was then; now Mangan was truly a vicious devil.But that is what this ship did to people; it marred their souls.As it had done to Sai ias.I had, in all truth, become fond indeed of Sai ias.She was a gentle beast, and a thoughtful one.It touched me to see how          she became involved in the lives of others; she knew each sentient on the ship by name and knew the names of their planets          too, and could remember all the names of their lost loved ones.She remembered I had lost a wife called Malisha and a daughter          called Sharil; I had only told her once but she never forgot.But her soul was still tainted; for Sai iass way of surviving was a form of complicity.She made the ship run smoothly; and          hence the Kaun had an easier time.She taught the ways of acceptance; and thus the Kauns slaves were docile, and easier          to handle.She was the prisoner who helps her own gaolers; I had always despised that type.And so, after learning the scale of Sai iass treachery in collaborating with the despotic Kindred, I refused to talk to her,          or deal with her in any way.Instead I spent my time alone, climbing the mountain paths, swimming the lake, and exploring          the ship.I refused to participate in their godsforsaken Rhythm of Days; I wanted to keep my mind pure, and my body honed.And then one day, I swam to the Tower as I always did, at least once a day.And once I was in sight of the islands shore          the winds whipped up, as they always did.One time I had swum onwards and touched the force shield walls for myself.But the          walls of force could not be penetrated of course; and my presence in such proximity had caused a great storm that had vexed the others hugely; so it seemed futile to keep attempting it.So today, I merely trod water, and I stared at the Tower where dwelled my enemies; then I heard the sound of wings above me          and I looked up.And Cuzco swept downwards and caught me in his claws.I did not struggle, I let him carry me.He loosened his grip and I scrambled          free and clambered up on to his back.Turd for brains, said Cuzco amiably.Vile and ugly orange freak, I informed him.I enjoyed these flights; Cuzco soared up to the sky, almost touching it, then soared down, and made me dizzy with his speed.Then he hovered as low as he could above the Tower.I saw the shape of the gardens around it; the shrubs on the craggy rock.The Tower was huge; larger than many cities.It was so near, and yet so untouchable.Watch, said Cuzco, and he released the boulders in his rear claws and they dropped down out of the sky and they Bounced.Rattling like pebbles on a roofyet there was no roof, just airbefore sliding off in a downwards arc and splashing into the          sea.Force shield goes all around, I said.No way in, agreed Cuzco.No way to escape, I agreed.I believe, nevertheless, said Cuzco sombrely, that I may have found a way to leave this place.And my heart raced.Tell me, I said.Hell Ship           Sai ias It was Day the Third of my nine hundred and eighty four thousand four hundred and twenty second cycle of the Rhythm of Days,          and Sharrock approached me by the lake side.And for the first time in many cycles, he spoke to me.Are you well?he asked.I am.It seems then you thrive, said Sharrock, upon the misfortunes of others.I made no comment; yet I could not comprehend how he could say such a thing to me.I have been planning, said Sharrock, how we might escape this wretched vessel.And he smiled; but it was not a pleasant          smile.There is no way, I said.So I have concluded, Sharrock said, grimly.Best to accept the way things are.Acceptance is all.Yes, I know your lies, Sai ias.I have also been considering ways to attack          the Kaun.Many have tried and failed.How?Tell me all.I sighed.There is little point.Trust me on this: I have been here for many years.The problem is that we do not know who          the Kaun are, nor how to get at them in the Tower where they dwell.Have you yourself tried?Sharrocks tone was taunting; I wondered at his game.Yes, I admitted.I swam across many years ago.The way was blocked.Cuzco attempted to storm it with a flock of aerials,          that did not succeed.It cannot be done.Indeed, that tallies with all I know and have been advised, said Sharrock, his mood strangely buoyant.So what is it?I asked.Why are you speaking to me now?Oh, there is news, Sharrock said.And there was a smug look in his eyes; I feared the worst.What is it?Cuzco, he told me, has issued a challenge to Djamrock.The news shocked me.What cause?No cause.They fight at dawn.And Sharrocks features were lit with elation; for he knew already that my calm and ordered equilibrium was about to be destroyed.Two giant sentients were at war with each other, with no valid cause.Thus, bloody and pointless anarchy had returned to our world.We were in our cabin, the night before the combat.Fray was sombre; Lirilla was distressed; Doro was a pool of turbulent water;          Quipu was appalled at what was occurring, just as I was.And Cuzco himself was in arrogant and bombastic mood.On my planet, before we became gods to the other sentient species, we were hunted, said Cuzco, with a pride that repelled          me.The biped Mahonosi feared us and slew us.The four legged Karal feared us, and slew us.We were born in blood, we fought          each living day.And we survived.And we evolved.And we grew mightier and mightier.Evolved?From idiot, into total fucking idiot?snapped Quipu One.Good point, said Quipu Two.Where is it decreed, said Cuzco, that we should not fight?This creature is so arrogant!said Quipu Three.Such duels are foolish, and dangerous, I told Cuzco, They serve no purpose, and damage us all!Those words are true, said Quipu Four, and his fifth and first heads nodded in agreement.Cuzco snorted his contempt at me, and at the bobbing headed agreeing with himselves Quipus.I need, roared Cuzco, to taste blood and feel fear.Without that, I do not YOU CANNOT DO THIS!I screamed at Cuzco, and they all stared at me, for I do not usually scream.I wouldnt expect you to understand, Cuzco said, in tones of utter scorn.Why?Because Im not a blood crazed warrior?War is in my soul.It defines me.War is a form of madness, I told him.Do not give in to it.Oh let him do what he likes, said Quipu One, and his other heads hissed.Itshisfuneral, Doro taunted.Lirilla howled; not a song, a howl.I had never heard such a noise from her before; it sent a shudder down my central spine.Fray brooded, silent, conflicted; she knew the joy of war too, but this was all too much for her.Please, I implored Cuzco.It will be a glorious combat, Cuzco said, and steam emerged from his neck and skull; and I knew we had lost him.It was Day the Fourth.But no poems were to be recited this day.We gathered at the foot of the White Mountains.Cuzcos scales were orange and scarlet and shone in the bright sunlight.Djamrock          descended out of the clouds, his four wings flapping loudly.Djamrock had three heads, each of them fearsomely fanged and armoured.He was twice the size of Cuzco, and Cuzco was          a giant even amongst the giant sentients.No one had ever before dared to challenge Djamrock.But, from time to time, he had savaged unwary predators and herbivores          and ripped them limb from limb.Eventually they healed; but the shock of Djamrocks violence always left a lasting damage          in the souls of those he attacked.We accept the evil of the Kaun; but when our own kind turn on us, it more profoundly hurts.We formed a circle around the fighters.Sharrock caught my eye; and the ghastly smile on his face repelled me.His naked torso          was glistening with sweat; his red skin was darker in hue, a sure sign that he was agitated and surging with adrenalin.And I could feel terror descend upon me.Violence is a character aberration that perturbs and disgusts my soul, and so I truly          did not want to be here.For I am the child of a pacific species.We never fought, we never went to war, and, until the Kaun,          no other creatures had ever warred against usnot since we became sentient, many aeons ago.And yet, even so, I could not resist the mood of the day.The energy!The sheer exhilaration of being in the presence of the blood lust of all my fellow sentients!The combat began.The two beasts leaped and flapped wings savagely, and hovered in the air above us.I cannot bear to describe the scene, and yet I must; for the images are seared upon my mind and the pain of that day lives          as a reproach in my soul.At first, for the first twenty or more minutes, I did not directly observe the two beasts in their bloody combat; I merely          watched the watchers.It shocked me deeply.The screaming, the drooling, the roaring of rage, the obscenities uttered, the          lust for the dealing of death that consumed all those who beheld!A thousand and more different species all united in hate and loathing!Polypods and bipeds on the land, gathered in a vast crowd around the combatants; and sea dwellers peering up from          the lake, and swamp dwellers staring up from their boggy homes at the aerial part of the battle.Only the sessiles were unable          to witness the duel, for understandable reasons.Even the sentient plants were savouring what they saw of the spectaclejeering          and shedding leaves and spitting spores as they savoured the carnage.As she watched, Fray snorted and scratched the ground with her powerful hooves; clearly a large part of her wished she could          be part of this legendary fight.As for Quipu, he was in a frenzy; his heads whipping from side to side, a crazed look to him that I had never seen before.He was the dearest friend of Cuzco and, despite the cruel words that often passed between them, they felt a huge affection          for each other.And yet, as Cuzco bled, he roared, all five of his heads roared, in brutal exultation.And when I dragged my eleven eyes from the spectators, I saw blood raining from the sky as the two beasts gripped teeth into          flesh and rocked back and forth in the air.Whenever he could, Cuzco breathed fire from his skull holes and neck holes upon          his adversary, but the flames did not even sear the ebon hide of Djamrock.And Djamrocks three heads relentlessly pecked          and tore at Cuzcos flesh.One of Djamrocks wings was severed by a bite from Cuzco and went tumbling to the ground.The black beast flapped free and          spikes from its belly impaled Cuzco and Cuzco blazed fire again and the sky rocked with the horror of two monsters locked          in an aerial death embrace.Then Cuzco lost a wing too and tumbled to the ground and crashed and Djamrock moved downwards with talons extended to sever          his adversarys remaining limbs, and thus secure victory.Cuzco was dazed, and did not move.Djamrock was descending in a fast plunge.We all waited for the inevitable.But Djamrock halted his dive.He hovered in mid air above his near unconscious foe, his great wings beating.And slowly Cuzco stirred.Then looked up.And saw his enemy poised above          him, waiting.A long and powerful funnel of flame from Cuzcos skull enveloped Djamrocks body, but Djamrock did not flee.He remained hovering,          his wings beating out billows of flame, and after a time his black hide grew darker and the flesh below began to burn.Djamrock screamed and screamed.For his body was aflame beneath the near impregnable coating of his night dark armour.His          heads writhed from side to side.And Cuzco pulled himself on to his two legs and pounced, and his teeth caught Djamrocks          belly and ripped it.Then Cuzco took to the air again and flew above his opponent, stopped in a frozen hover, then plunged.And with a single powerful movement he landed on his prey and ripped Djamrocks head off his body.And then he ate it.A silence descended, as we watched, stunned.Cuzco fed the head into his mouth and ate the skull, and ate the brains too.The slow steady crunching appalled us.Even the rejuvenating powers of the water of the well of life could not heal that; so now, one of Djamrocks heads was completely dead.Cuzco blew flame from his skull again, and we could smell and taste the aroma; it was the reek of the remnants of the burnt          brain of Djamrock being expelled from Cuzcos body.Djamrocks other two heads stared at the sight.He was in dire agony, but his dark hide was recovering its normal lustre.The fire in his body was being extinguished, his flesh was healing again.He was recovering.And even though hed lost a head,          he still had enough power to rip the crippled Cuzco into pieces.But Djamrock did nothing.Cuzco pounced again and ripped off a second head.And he ate that too.And he billowed steam from his neck to sluice his system          of the last traces of alien skull and brain.No!screamed a voice.No!screamed another voice.But these were lone voices in the mob.I heard a drumming sound, as the crowd clapped and stamped their feet and chanted: Kill him, kill him, kill him!Cuzco pounced one final time and ripped off Djamrocks third head.And ate it.And shat out the remnants through his neck holes.And then Cuzco looked at me, with triumph and sorrow in his old eyes.And I knew then: this had been planned.This was a death          pact between Cuzco and Djamrock.And Djamrock had won.His victory in battle had entitled him to the ultimate reward: his irrevocable death.Except that Djamrock was not truly dead.His sentience and his soul lingered on in his headless corpse.It endured in the          particles of brain ash that still floated in the air.Djamrock was thus doomed to an eternity of torment.But he had died fighting; and that was enough for him.The thought of what he had done, and what Cuzco had aided him in doing, appalled me.I slithered away.I was ashamed, so deeply ashamed, of Cuzco, of Djamrock, and of the rest of my fellow sentients.Could they not see that defeat          was preferable by far to this kind of terrible victory?That night, I crept out of my cabin and made my way through the pitch blackness of the interior planets artificial light,          using memory to guide me, until I reached the lake.And I there I sat, and listened to the waters lapping.In the morning, as the sun rose.I watched the first fish leap from the water.I watched the aerials flock in the sky above,          dancing patterns in air.Do you not see, I argued, that Cuzco must be banished?An example must be made.I was addressing the Guiding Council of the Sentients; twelve of us in all.Quipu, Biark, Sahashs, Loramas, Thugor, Amur,          Kairi, Wapax, Fiymean, Krakkka, Raoild.And Sharrock, too, was there; for he had, unknown to me, been elected as a thirteenth          Council Member and hence now had a responsibility for the government of this world.The meeting was going badly.Quipus five heads were all laughing at me for my attempt to actually punish Cuzco for achieving a glorious victory.Sharrocks scorn too was evident in his every cold glare.And the otherssentients I had known and regarded as friends for so many years!treated me with a contempt that they barely          bothered to disguise.Thugor made a pacifying gesture.His words were silken, we felt them as much as we heard them.You, my Sai ias, he said,          you, kind and gentle being, have always been a kisser of the arse of your enemy.Cuzco however is a hero.He showed us a          way out.Through war and glory.You should celebrate him, not censure.What he did was wrong, I insisted.He enabled Djamrock to escape.He cursed Djamrock!He will lead others to the way of death.That is not what we need, I said, trying to keep calm, and          to rein in my fury.Cuzco is a hero, agreed Fiymean.Sai ias you are a dismal coward.You know nothing of war.I know much about Its pathetic, said Kairi, in a shrill scornful voice, her feathers vibrating to make the sounds that the air translated.All the things we do, and that you encourage us to do.The Days.The Temple.We demolish, we rebuild.We tell stories.The          same stories.We talk about science, but we barely understand each others ideas, and have virtually no technology, and no way of acquiring fresh data.We talk about history, for all we have is history.There will be, for us, no more history.It is all futile.What Cuzco has done has shone a light on our world, and all we can          see is shit and lies.It is not futile, I argued, in my gentlest of tones.Sai ias, fuck yourself with a barbed weapon, and die in the process.You turd eating coward.You pathetic fucker.Youre not welcome here, you slimy sea fucking monster.Cuzco is our god.And so they continued; the taunting, sneering voices.I hated it so much, yet I endured the mockery patiently.My task was all the harder because none of these creatures remembered the early years; the days of Carulha, and my two battles          against him.For all the great beasts of that time had died, of Despair, or in some Kaun battle or other.Only the Kindred          remembered; and even they were starting to forget what I had truly done for this world.To this new generation, I was just          a complacent fool; preaching peace and harmony to an angry lynch mob.Cuzco must be banished, I insisted, for the good of all.And then I paused for effect, and said: I so order it.But my words were like a light breeze in the midst of a hurricane; no one heeded them.Sai ias, said Quipu One, my favourite of the Quipus, and one of my oldest friends on the ship, this is none of your affair.It is my affair, I said angrily.You idiot Quipu, you know nothing Ah, fuck away, said Quipu One contemptuously.I have no more time for you.Well said.Fuck away, Sai ias, said Quipu Two.Fuck away Sai ias!said Quipu Three.Cuzco is our hero now, said Quipu Four, and his eyes gazed into the far distance, remembering the glory and the triumph of Djamrocks demise.Fuck away, you black hided beast!said Quipu Five.No one cares what you say, or what you think.Not any more.I looked at Sharrock.Sai ias, he said to me gently.You are wrong.Words do not hurt me, usually.Those words did.Lirillas wings fanned my face.This is a cruel world, I told her, the sweetest creature on this entire world.But I know I am right.Lirilla flew away without speaking.I found Cuzco, surrounded by acolytes in the field of green, telling his tale of victory to a mob that included Sharrock and          Quipu.I used my tentacles to hurl myself towards the crowd.I heard muttering and hissings and muttered insults.Cuzco, I called          out.Cuzco raised himself up, and his great wings beat and he hovered above me, baring his face whose soft features were distorted          with contempt.You saw me fight?he roared.It is Day the Fifth, I said to him and the assembled crowd.It is our day of music and celebration.A waste, roared Cuzco, of fucking time.Laughter rocked the crowd.Sharrock stared at me sadly, his contempt merging with his pity in a toxic brew.We need it.It fills our days, I said.Cuzco pushed out his chest.And his faceor rather an illusion of a face, patterns of expression on the soft skin of the breast of his left bodybore an intrigued expression.It          was you, wasnt it?he asked.You created the idea of the Temple?I did, I said.And the Days, you created those too.I did, I admitted.And the whole structure of our lives.The gatherings.The cabins.The Guiding Council.That was you.When I first came to the ship, I said, all was anarchy and Cuzco laughed at me.And the crowd laughed.Even Sharrock laughed.And in that terrible moment, I felt humiliated.For I was, I realised, considered by all present to be a gullible fool who believed that make believe work was better than real work.I was the one, the only one, who did not understand that glory is to be found in heroic defeat, not in meek surrender!I understood          at that moment the depth and sincerity of their scorn, and of their contempt.And I found myself consumed by self hate.Was          I really this wretched creature they despised so much?Sharrock, ignore them.Do not laugh at me.You and I know better about what is right, I said wretchedly.But he grinned          at me too, tauntingly.However, I stood my ground.Cuzco, you are banished, I said, as firmly as I was able.That is my irrevocable decision.The mob began to howl and shout, drowning out my words.I continued desperately: You must dwell on the mountain crags, but          you cannot speak to anyone or be spoken to by anyone.When you are gone, all will return to normal.Our Rhythm of Days will          return.Few could hear me for all the baying and roaring, but still I continued: Fighting will once more be forbidden.I do not ask          this, I do not beg for it, I demand it !You fucking turd sucking bog fucking slack cunted bitch, said Cuzco.Why dont you fuck My tentacle lashed out, and unfolded in an instant to double its usual length; and I swung it in a huge loop to create momentum; then I smote Cuzco with it.The blow was powerful and as fast as thought itself, and he was knocked across the ground like a ball struck with a bat in          one of the bipeds wretched games.There was a startled silence.Cuzco got back on his feet.He puffed up his chest again, and showed me his face; there was glee in his expression.Ive          been waiting, said Cuzco, for this for a long        I struck again but this time Cuzco was expecting it and he rolled out of the way.And when he came out of the roll his wings          unfurled and he beat them and he was in the air and he pounced down at        I wasnt there.I used my tentacles to grip the ground and fling myself upwards.And as I flew my quills emerged and I skimmed          Cuzcos body and my quills crashed against his body armour, and we both fell to the ground.I flipped over again and narrowly avoided a funnel of flame from Cuzcos head.Then I fired a fusillade of quills at him from          my stomach hole and he was shocked as these brutal arrows smashed against his hide.He buckled up his breast armour, burying          his soft face away, so his bodies were now just two vast horned carapaces covered in impregnable scales.He paced towards me.I slithered towards him.A quill stuck out from his hide, close to one of his heavily shielded eyes.His tread was light.He was sizing me up.We faced each other in the field of green, and all around us a myriad alien species watched; furred, feathered, scaled, covered          in hide, small, large, brightly coloured, drably coloured; a whole menagerie of strangeness, rapt in joy at the sight of this,          the second great fight in two days.I felt the ground shudder and I knew that Fray had arrived, to watch his two friends fight.But then I realised, with a terrible and sudden clarity, that she and I werent truly friends at all.We were merely companions,          and fellow captives.But she cared nothing for me, not really; not did she have any concept of who I truly am, of the real Sai ias.Fray and Cuzco also were bound together by sheer force of circumstance; their friendship here was a matter of convenience,          no more.They were large; and savage; and heavily armoured; that was all they had in common!And whats more, it now seemed obvious that despite our seeming friendship, Cuzco and I had always harboured a deep loathing          of each other.He, a savage flesh eating monster, I a cultured vegetarian; what could connect two such different beasts?The          answer was clear: nothing.Oh, now I could see it all so plainly.All was lies and cruelty and hate!Nothing on this world had any value!These truths          came crashing down upon me.But even so, I felt obliged to fight.A funnel of flame billowed out of Cuzcos skull and I did not move.My skin ignited and I was enveloped in a fireball and          still I did not move.My flesh melted, and the burning smell of my body filled the air and still I did not move.When the flames died down, my soft outer skin had been burned away and what remained was the jet black diamond hard carapace          of my inner body.My tentacles were sheathed; my eyes were protected; my skin would grow back in a matter of days, and would          have done so even if I had still been on my home planet.And all could now see the remarkable truth: that the inner Sai ias is a warrior born.I pounced.My tentacles unfurled, I gripped the ground, I flung myself up and at Cuzco, and I caught his scaly hide with my tentacle          tips and swung him round and crashed him to the ground.As he lay dazed I flipped into the air and flew downwards, my central          quill extended, and I stabbed him in the fleshy skin of his stomach.He recovered and swept at me with his powerful paws and knocked me aside, but I rolled and threw myself upright and launched again.Cuzco took to the air but I was just as fast and I threw myself upwards and as I did my tentacle tips retracted and my inner          claws were exposed and I used these claws to grip and rip his flesh in mid air.His wings beat, he struggled to keep his flight,          as I ripped away his hide and blood gouted from his body on to the field of grass below.Cuzco came crashing to the ground, and I beat him again and again with my tentacles.He fired his flames again but they could          do no harm to my chitinous body and armoured tentacles; and my eyes, too, were made of hard scales not soft flesh and could          not be burned or stabbed or gouged.I played with him for a while, smashing him with my tentacles, and mockingly absorbing his flames as if they were sunshine          on a warm day.Then finally I spat, and an unfolding matrix of web embraced his body and trapped him.Victory was mine.He is banished, I told the crowd.Take the body to the mountain top and leave it there.Fill a container with water of          life and leave it beside his body.Cuzco will not be of our family until ten years have elapsed, and he has earned my forgiveness.No one demurred.Sharrock was staring at me, astonished; and he smiled with open joy.I recoiled at his approval; I was revolted by the love of the crowd.For before, I had been right, and yet I had been mocked.And nownow I had proved I was nothing but a violent thug, with more          flair for war than even the powerful Cuzconow, the mob would follow me anywhere.This was the quintessential predator prey mindset; the belief that only power endorsed by violence should command respect.And I despised them all for it.And, in all candour, I despised myself too, for playing their pathetic game.For I believe in love and not war; yet to save my world, I have to be a monster.And so a monster I have become.I went to the storm zones and let a hurricane bombard my hard carapace.A few times I thought I would be swept away and smashed          against the icy clouds.I roared with rage into the hurricanes open mouth, and felt anguish and guilt that hurt me more than the winds sharp knives.My outer skin grew back.The Rhythm of our Days returned.The Temple was demolished; and then we began to rebuild it.Stories          were told.Science was discussed.And Cuzco was now a memory; he lived in solitude on a mountain top eyrie, the very emblem of the way we should not be.And          my world was safe; and, to such degree as it was possible to be content in such a place, my people were indeed content.And I was revered now, and not despised.My smallest request was treated as a command; no one ever interrupted me.I felt          like a god.And I loathed it.The fields had to be tilled every month.Armies of polypods thundered across the artificial soil, kicking with hooves and          ripping with claws, and aerials swooped down and sifted soil.And at the end of this long process, the soil was no more fertile          than it had been before.The trees and bushes needed to be pruned every week.Some of the vegetation ran riot and grew at a terrifying rate, and the arboreals used saws and swords to hack pieces off the runaway          shrubs and trees to reduce them to a manageable height.But what would it have mattered if the trees had grown to the heavens?There would still have been space enough to move in.And though the browsing animals ate the grass, and chewed the tree bark, there was no nourishment to be gained from that.It was a squandering of time to tend this garden, for our bodies were fed by other means.The ice clouds soaked up moisture from the air and grew daily, and so they had to be regularly milked.To achieve this, the          aerials flew inside the jagged cloudsclouds which had once floated in the skies of the icy world where Quipu had livedand          pissed their hot urine downwards, melting the ice.And the urine tainted rain fell upon the land and the lake; and the ice clouds          shrank.And all of us felt the mixed blessing of being rained upon by water filthily stained with piss.Thus, every time it rained, bleak irony drenched me as much as did the raindrops.And so there was always work to be done.And it was always futile, desperate, purposeless work.Such was the rhythm of our          days.It was Day the First and I was climbing a mountain, and I could not resist the urge; I went to see Cuzco.My claws gripped the cliff face tightly, and I was able to clamber up the steepest slopes, despite my bulk.I enjoyed this          kind of physical effort; it invigorated me.I had no idea where Cuzco was dwelling but I followed my instincts; it would be the highest crag, the most remote spot.I          reached the top of the mountain summit and looked for him in vain.Then I hurled myself off and glided to the next summit;          and when I found him not, I leaped again, and reached the next summit.And then the next.Then I landed on an icy crag and found myself sliding across a glacier.Strange ice creatures peered          at me, and I marvelled that I had never seen them before.I called out to Cuzco, again and again, with a shrill whistling noise that I knew he would recognise as my ocean call.The day passed, and I found no trace of Cuzco.It was Day the Second and I was due to be at the Temple to help raise the stones.But instead I returned to the mountain peaks          and searched again for Cuzco.It was Day the Third; my search continued.At the end of Day the Fourth I was frustrated and weary and I made a wild decision; I would not return to my cabin when the          black night fell.And so I waited, buffeted by cold winds, as the sun set and cast its rosy glow upon our fake and evil world.Then the daylight          in the air was switched off; sheer blackness descended.There were no stars, there was no residual light.
