The lights come and wake me from dying. At least I must be dying because Im wet and cold and bleeding and everything seems broken inside of me. All around me I can smell smoke and burning gas and the sea. Inside of me, a voice insists that theres something next to me. Something good. Something to save me. But when I try to turn, everything goes black again. Death hovers, close by. The lights bring me back, dancing over me with a roaring hum. I remember stories I read when I was a kid, stories of angelsbright, blinding, flying angels. Have they finally come for me? Some moments pass, my head spinning, and then theyre lifting me up, out of the raft, and into the sky. Where are you taking me? I want to ask. But I cant. And something about leaving the ocean, going up into the sky, feels right. More time passeshands touching me that I cant shrug off. I slip away once or twice. When I awake again, I hear someone saying to take me to the infirmary. Its apt because Im very fucking infirm. Anyone would be after the last few days Ive had. Beaten, shot, strung out on painkillers, beaten again, stabbed, then dropped from an exploding airship into cold ocean waters. Well, when I say dropped, I mean more like I jumped. But it seemed like a good idea at the time. Thinking about that makes me think of the Cherub, my airship, which was named after angels, and the last time I saw her, ripping apart into a bright fireball as I fell. It brings on pain of a different flavor. She was more than just my homeshe was my safety, my security, my freedom. Miranda, I manage to gasp. Shes the other woman in my life. Or rather, the one whos left. She fell with me, into the ocean. We somehow both managed to survive, huddled in the bottom of a life raft, clinging to one another, wet and cold, our ears still ringing from the explosion, flames still dotting the water where the fiery wreckage fell. We lay there, together, and I couldnt even think. All I did was hold Miranda and take comfort in the fact that we were alive and together and she was solid in my arms. Later, I thought that if we managed to make it through the night into the morning, that we might have a shot. She was what was next to me, I remember. Shes what I was trying to find. Miranda, I repeat. Who? a voice asks. Thats her name, another voice replies. The woman. Where is she? I ask. Is she okay? Shell be back soon, one of the voices says. I reach up for the arms nearest me, grip them as hard as I can. No, I say. I need to know. Then my grip wavers and my arms go watery and the person pulls away from my grasp. Give him another one, a voice says. Then I feel a sharp pinch. And the world draws away around me.  Im below the ocean, only this time its warm and thick, not the shocking, freezing thing it was after I fell. Its comfortable. Almost welcoming. I find this amusing since I have always preferred the sky. But slowly I feel myself start to rise and the air gets thinner and brighter, and then Im opening my eyes to ... light. I smell metal and the sea and antiseptic. As my vision clears, I realize Im lying on a tablecold metal, but with some kind of tarp draped over it. Im not wearing a shirt, and my wounds have been bandaged. I ache, but the pain is dulled, lost in the wake of the painkillers Ive apparently been given. A woman wearing a surgical mask sees me stir, then leaves the room. As I sit up, feeling the skin pulling on my wounds, and grunting because of it, the door opens again and a man enters what I now realize is the infirmary. The metal tables and the counters and instruments all paint the picture. But my attention is drawn to the man. Malik. Hes looking better than he was the last time I saw him. His skin is tanned by the sun to a light-brown color. Hes wearing his black hair long and he has an extremely neatly trimmed beard, which is a nice trick, seeing as how most of the tools for that kind of thing have long since turned to shit. He stands at the edge of my table and eyes me up and down. Mal, I say, suddenly on edge. Youre alive. Benjamin, he says, like he just picked a bullet out of his teeth. As sharp as ever. My God, I say. I had no idea. I feel something hard lodge in my chest. Thank you for patching me up. He shakes his head. Like everything he does, its a precise movement, no wasted energy. That wasnt me. That was courtesy of your companion. Miranda? He nods. How is she? Where is she? I need to see her. I start to get up off the table, but he pushes me back, firmly and precisely, and my chest erupts into a constellation of pain despite the drugs Im on. You dont get to make demands, he says, and I see his carefully cultivated mask slip for a moment. Whats behind is rage. And I know exactly why. Mal and I go way back, and our last meeting didnt end so well. He straightens and examines his gloves. Miranda is safe and unharmed, Benjamin. That will have to suffice for now. My mind races, then falls back into an old, familiar pattern of movement. Even through the painkillers its a place Im used toassess, look for opportunities, survive. Its clear that Mal isnt happy with me, and Im not sure I blame him. But he still pulled me out of the ocean. Still let Miranda patch me up. So Im on unsteady ground. I dont know what he wants. And so I cant use that. What happened to you? He knows what Im asking. How did he survive? What happened after I saw him last? He looks away for a moment. Pardon me if I dont feel like digging up ancient history, he says. I have no wish to reminisce about old times. I get that youre mad at me Mal slams his fist down on the edge of the table and I jump, again feeling the pain ripple through me. Mad? Mad? He shakes his head, his face twisted with disgust. You continue to underestimate me, Benjamin. I take a deep breath. So why am I here? You didnt need to fish me out of the water. Mal takes a deep breath, too, smoothing his long hair back from his face where it had fallen. He straightens his jacket. His face returns to its impassive state. My people saw the wreckage in the water. Fresh wreckage. He shrugs. Old habits. They were checking for salvage ... and information. What kind of information? What do you think, Benjamin? Youre telling me that if you saw that kind of fallout, it wouldnt attract your attention? Were operating in these waters. Knowing whats happening around us is only prudent. I try to process all of this, and its hard with the painkillers dragging on my thoughts. Cmon, Ben. Get it together. I return to the phrase were operating in these waters. Could Mal be working with Gastown? I look back up at him to see him examining my face. Are you working with Gastown? I ask. It isnt subtle, and its not what I had planned to say (as far as I planned anything) but it just spills out. He squints, then shakes his head. No. Neither in its former nor current incarnations. Thats how Mal likes to speak. Never a simple word when a more ornate one will do. In that way hes a little like Miranda. I nod. Those were Gastown ships in the water. Them and the Cherub. I feel a pain when I mention my airship. Ive heard tell of people having phantom pains in lost limbs. Could you have that for an airship? I know this already, Mal says. Your companion told me. I frown. You still havent told me why Im here, then. If Miranda told you what happened, you could have dropped me back in the ocean. I thought of it, he says with a smile. Believe me, I thought of it. But? I wanted you to see me. I wanted you to know that I survived. He waves a hand in the air, nonchalantly. I have no illusions that it will provoke a response, but I needed you to know. I nod. Its classic Mal. His ego has always been one of his most developed attributes. So now that I know, now you toss me in the ocean? His face goes serious. No. No? No. Your companion and I Miranda. ...Miranda and I came to an agreement. My head is still swimming, and none of this is making sense. Mal is alive. And wants to kill me. Yet Im still alive. And he made a deal with Miranda? We always have need for people with medical training, he says. He shrugs. She made her skills known to me. But... He pauses for a moment. Shes quite shrewd. She insisted that she demonstrate her skills. On you. Its such a nice piece of negotiation that I cant help smiling. Its the kind of thing I usually try to doidentify a need, make myself useful, benefit. She not only secured a safe space for herself, but she saved me in the process. All I can say is that youre very lucky, Mal says. None of my people would have worked on you. Not in your state. Not without quarantine. And you probably would have died, otherwise. I locked her in here with you, with some medical supplies, and she worked on you through the quarantine period. That youre alive, and awake, is a testament to her abilities. Shes one of the best. He nods. That, we can agree on. How she chose to associate with you... People change, Mal. The look he gives me sends chills through me. Its like being in a room with a wild animala wolf or a cougar. Mal clearly hates me. He has lots of reason to, Ill admit, but he also has all the power here. I keep trying to kick my brain out of the painkiller fuzz, but its slow going, all uphill, and gravitys pulling at me. Miranda had been thinking quickly, making herself useful, saving me. Now I have to do my part. Mal, I He quiets me by holding up his hand. Please dont, Benjamin. I can see the achingly slow grinding of your minds gears. Youre going to try to give me reasons not to kill you. Damn. The thing is, Benjamin, I had a plan; one I thought poetic. I would leave you in the ocean, all alone, with no wings to carry you. With no friends to aid you. Leave you in the great vastness and just ... sail away. I could take odds on what would get you firsta shark? some other ship? drowning? The thought scares me more than I ever imagined it could. But Im not. Why? Mal rubs at a spot on his left glove. That was the other part of my agreement with Miranda. Her terms were that she get to demonstrate her skills on you, and ... that I keep you alive until we reach our destination. Thank God, I think. He must see the relief on my face because he says, What I promised her, exactly, was that I would keep you on the ship. And that I wouldnt take any action to harm you. And so I wont. Because it doesnt matter. He smiles at me. Once we arrive, however, I will have my moment. Believe me when I say that Ive been imagining all the many things I might do with you at that point. Another scary feeling, this time one that sticks like a rock in my gut. Just then, my mind clears a bit more and I realize what he just said and that the rocking sensation Im feeling isnt completely from the drugs. Did you say ship? Its not an airshipI would know if it was. Are we on the water? Your speed is as remarkable as always, Mal says. Cut me a little slack, I say. Ive had a lot of painkillers. I am aware, he says, glaring at me. He sighs. Yes, you are on board a ship right now. A warship. Shes called the Phoenix. You stole her? He looks at me, sharp, assessing. Like a bird. I recovered her. Of course you did, I think. She was secured in a naval facility. My people and I liberated her. Its a score, of course. Military targets have long been a flame the foraging moths have flown to over the years, but as a result the pickings are slim. Even if you do find something intact worth taking, the effort of getting it operational, being able to run it, is often too much. There are plenty of rotting old hulks in naval yards and off the coast. That he found one and managed to get it to work.... It took years to get it running, he says. Time during which my people were vulnerable. He smiles. But in the end we were triumphant. Jesus, I think. A warship. In Mals hands. The weapons? I ask. His smile grows wider. Almost completely operational. That was one of the most difficult parts. She was partly stocked, but making sure everything worked and was loaded properly took some time. I dont believe it, I say. His smile is predatory and triumphant. That is because you have no imagination. We achieved a great victory, here, my people and I. And it will be our salvation. The word makes me uneasy. Especially in the Sick. So you live here. He nods. In some ways, the ocean is safer than the sky. I find the words distasteful, but they make me think of Tamoanchan, an island settlement I recently visited. I think of Diego and Rosie, Sergei, even Clay. All the people Miranda and I left behind. I thought that sacrificing the Cherub might have saved them from attack, but that didnt mean more wouldnt be coming. I needed off this ship. Where are you sailing it? I ask. Hawaii. A legend of sorts. Ive met people who determined to go there, lured by the promise of old magazines and books. You know its overrun with Ferals, right? He shrugs. Thats the rumor. But its a series of islands. And by now the Ferals should have dwindled, equalized to a stable number. We can take our time to clean them out. And if the idea of it keeps others away, then all the better. If their maps already say, Here there be monsters, then why disabuse them of that notion? I shake my head. Thats the life youre going to lead? Doesnt seem suited to someone like you. Things change, is all he says. I chew on it for a bit. Mal was on his way to a leadership position the first time I met him, but he seems to have taken it quite seriously. Seriously enough to risk his life on a dream. Miranda bought me some time. But then what? Even if he doesnt kill me right away, well be stuck there. With no way of getting off. Things do change, I say. Let me prove it to you. Mal laughs. You? I cant help frowning at him. Oh, Benjamin. I see what you mean. Youve developed a sense of humor. Mal No. The word is as hard and cold as stone. I dont care if youve changed. If you can grow wings or if you shit out my hearts desire on command. I have you. And Im taking you with us until I can deal with you in the appropriate way. He leans forward. Do you get that? You are mine. He turns to leave. Meditate on that on our journey. Then he leaves me to my solitude.  They move me to something more resembling a cell shortly later, something that was probably a bunk back in the Clean. Theres a simple bed, a sink, and a toilet. I suppose it could be worse. I could have to shit on the floor. They feed me, too. Scraps and slop, but its something. I guess Mals sticking to his promise to Miranda. I can imagine him rationalizing it, too. Telling himself hell punish me at a time and place of his choosing. He has an overdeveloped sense of honor. Something tells me that Miranda picked up on that and used it against him. Thinking of Miranda sends a pang through menot knowing where she is, or how she is. What shes doing. How Mals treating her. Theres no way that hes going to let her see me. That will be off-limits, even if she wants to, but. ... But theres this strange, nagging voice inside my head that says maybe she doesnt want to see me. I dont think it makes sense, but it still pipes up from time to time. I keep trying to stamp it down. And this is the problem with being stuck with no one but yourself. With no books or music or people to talk to. You start having crazy thoughts. In one of these, Mal charms Miranda and, well, lets just say she responds. Im definitely going to go crazy in here. Of course I search my cell for means of escape but, well, there doesnt seem to be any. The door to the room is locked from the outside, and there are no windows or other openings inside. There is the toilet, but judging by its dimensions, the hole beneath it would be too small for me to squeeze through. Just one book, I think. One book. It wouldnt even matter which one. Once, when I was holed up in an old house that just happened to sit next to a Feral nest, I read the same book four times. In a row. And it was about rabbits. Another time, when Dad had dropped me off on a rooftop, circling around to pick me up later (and got delayed), I read the same romance novel twice, the second time acting out all the parts. I sometimes go to great lengths to pass the time. A short time later, my food arrives. Those scraps and slop. Its skins and rinds and cores, cartilage and bone. The vegetables are just shy of rotting, the fish is too soft and has a smell that almost makes me gag. Something that was once leafy and green is now a muddy smear. Yet I open my mouth and shovel as much as I can in. Because I need to eat, and Im hungry. I need to heal. That I dont enjoy it doesnt really come into it. Much. It helps that Ive been on my own and hungry for much of my adult life. Ive eaten all kinds of things out of desperation. This is tolerable at its worst. Or at least thats what I tell myself. Especially every time I start to gag. I start marking the days on my mattress, scoring lines into the fabric covering. One. Two. Three. I start talking to myself. Except that quickly that loses all appeal. Im a terrible conversationalist. So I start thinking about the old days. About the last time I saw Mal. It wasnt a good time.         TWO It happened back a short while after my father Faded, when I was still flying around with Claudia. This was back before she got the Valkyrie, when the two of us were living on the Cherub. I had been telling Claudia that we could get by with foraging, but she wanted to do other things, take on jobs, try for the big score. I eventually agreed. I think we were both reeling from what happened to Dad and were trying to strike out into new territory. And, I cant speak for her, but I was definitely feeling a little self-destructive at the time. So we spent more time around people. There was no Gastown back then, but there were other settlements, either fixed or roaming. Its hard to keep track of people in the Sick, but there are ways. When you move on, leave a message behind about where youre headed, and a radio frequency. If someone is looking, all they have to do is go to that location and scan for signals. Of course you have to do it in code so not just anyone can find you. So we kicked around zep dives until we found what we were looking for. The ultimate score. A police storage facility, Cheyenne said. She wore a cowboy hat and always seemed peppy. The smile on her sun-freckled face was as wide as the sky. We sat on a rooftop in San Francisco, our airships anchored around us, five folding chairs arranged in a rough circle. Forget it, I said. Everyone looked at me. Too much trouble. Ive hit police installations before. Getting past security is tricky enough, and its almost certainly crawling with Ferals. Not to mention that its probably been looted before. Or maybe someones living there. A lot of police facilities had shelters in them. That made them attractive to anyone looking to hole up. Not to mention the weapons and ammunition they usually held. Dont worry about security, Cheyenne said and winked at me. She actually winked. I looked at Claudia, who shrugged. We knew Cheyenne the least out of everyone involved with this job. But of course shes the one who came with the details. No, seriously, Cheyenne continued. Thats what Malik is for. All eyes turned toward Malik standing quietly behind his chair. His hair was shorter then, and he favored a mustache over a full beard, but he otherwise looked much the same. He seemed preternaturally calm, unruffled. Out of everyone involved in the job, I had known Mal the longest, excluding Claudia. We were about the same age, ran in similar circles. Mal was a forager, too, though he often trod the fine line between foraging and pirating. Oddly enough, he had a good reputationhe didnt kill or attack the vulnerable. And he seemed more interested in forming a group, getting like-minded people to work together. He had asked me to join several times, but I couldnt really see myself doing that. We had worked on opposite sides in the past, but also together. I shouldnt have liked him, but the thing is, I really did. We had a kind of friendly rivalry. Benjamin is quite familiar with my ability to crack locks, he said. He directed a smug smile at me. Surely you remember Portland. Or Reno. Both places where hed scooped me. To the others he said, his smile never wavering, I am quite practiced in cracking old locks. Often the cargo I liberate is locked or secured, and its worth far more in pristine condition. And Ive been in military installations before. Already that had become part of Mals reputation. It kept him and his entourage well-armed and well-stocked. It also meant he was a good addition to this job. Do we know this place hasnt been hit before? I asked. Thats just it, Cheyenne said. Its not on a base or a station. Its not an obvious target. Where, then? Claudia asked. Cheyenne tipped her cowboy hat back from her head. A warehouse. A big storage facility. She leaned in. Its military-grade equipment. Sold to the police. The way I hear it, the police were like small armies back in the Clean. They had too much to keep in their station. Theres plenty of stories about that kind of thing, Tess said, leaning back in her chair. A lot of that kind of equipment saw use when the Bug hit. Tess had been making a name for herself, at the time already an expert in the Clean. She was older than all of us, short and square and smart. She looked at us from behind large, thick glasses. Its quality equipment, Cheyenne said. But the scuttle is that they never got a chance to use it. Because of where it was. And how exactly did you find out about this cache? I asked. I looked at Tess, who shook her head, indicating it wasnt her. Whats it matter how I found it? Cheyenne asked. Because if some cracked-out drunk told you about it, I want to know, I said. If some plod sold it for a ride in your ship, I want to know. It matters. Cheyenne held up her hands. Okay, okay. I did a favor for a guy I know, a fixer, and he was gonna patch up my ship. Only the favor was a fuck-lot more dangerous than either of us expected. The ship didnt need no more work, and so he offered something else. This location. Howd he get it? Claudia asked. His father, read? Hed been trying to get people together to go after it, but he doesnt fly in the right circles. So he gave it to me. Just like that, I said. Well, he wants me to bring him back something. A taste of sweet barter. But thats it. And you swallow this? I asked Tess. She nodded. I did some preliminary checking, and it seems to be legit. As far as these things go. It wouldnt exactly have been common knowledge back then. Everyone was silent as we mulled the whole thing over. So whats the plan? Claudia asked at last. Cheyenne smiled. We use only one ship. That way we dont attract too much attention. Ben, yours should do. Shes fast, Claudia says, and you have the cargo space we need to get anything we want off of the ground. Okay, I said. Malik and Lord Tess help get us in, dealing with any physical or electronic security. The rest of us are musclewe clear out any Ferals in the way. Then all of us grab what we can carry, bring it back to the ship, and get the fuck out of there. Even split? I asked. Cheyenne nodded. Fairest way possible. I looked at Claudia. It sounded fine, especially with five of us, but what it ultimately came down to was a matter of trust. I trusted Claudia, of course. And probably Mal. Or maybe not trust, but respect. I knew that I could depend on him and his abilities. Id heard of Lord Tessshe had a reputation even back thenand she seemed on the straight, but I didnt know Cheyenne from a patch of cloud. What do you think? I asked Claudia. She narrowed her eyes. I think that if this bears out, it could keep us flush for some time. And I think that with this kind of score, I might just be able to get my own ship. I gritted my teeth at that. She had been talking about getting her own ship for weeks now. I wanted her to stay on the Cherub with me. Sure, we sometimes came close to killing one another, and I often found myself wanting to be by myself. But back then I never had been. I had always been with my father. I think the thought of being truly alone scared me to death. What do you say? Cheyenne asked. With a sinking sensation in my stomach, I stared her in the eyes and said, Were in.  When youre an independent airship operator, your ship is your home. Its often your livelihood. Its usually one of the most (if not the most) important objects in your life. So, leaving one behind always makes you apprehensive. For the job at the police warehouse, I was going to be flying the Cherub, but that meant that everyone else had to leave their ships behind. Tess didnt have one, but Mal and Cheyenne were trusting that their ships would be okay in their absence. Back then, Mal was flying a cargo ship, very similar to the Cherub, though made by a different firm. He had cronies, even back then, so he gave it over to them. I never knew what Cheyenne had arranged. Using a single ship had been a good plan, of course. People in the Sick are opportunists. See a few ships together, especially down on the ground, and you have an indication that something is up. Something potentially lucrative. A lone ship, though. That could be someone looking for food. Or making hasty repairs. Or anything. Lone ships are often not worth the trouble. Unless, that is, youre desperate. And of course one ship means less resistance than three. But on this trip the plan was to not be noticed. I stood by the Cherub as the others approached. Mal eyed the ship appraisingly. Still no weapons? he asked. Mal had outfitted his ship, called A Star without a Name, with several weapons he had liberated from military installations. I shook my head. Not my style. People change, Benjamin, he said with a smile. Theres no need for weapons on this job, is there? I asked. Shes fast and she can carry. Thats all that matters. He tilted his head. Whats her name? Tess asked. The Cherub. Cheyenne laughed. What the fuck kind of name is that? she asked. Its named after a type of angel, I said. A smiling, plump, baby-angel if Im not wrong, Lord Tess said. I sighed. The cherubim were guardians and divine messengers, winged and terrible. Cherubs guarded the Garden of Eden in the Holy Scripture. They were said to have four wings, like the fins of the ship. Stupid name, Cheyenne muttered. I came very close to throwing them all off of the ship. I had been used to having Claudia and my father aboard the Cherub (toward the end, my father let me fly her) but having four other people made the gondola feel cramped. Even though I was at her controls, I could feel the other people around, behind me, in my air, my space. The Cherubs gondola wasnt small, but it felt like it had been invaded. Somethings been bothering me, I said. Youre saying that this wasnt the first place the police came when the Bug hit? Youd think theyd load for bear. Cheyenne came around to face me. They didnt have a chance, so Im told. They were overrun pretty quickly. And thats all we have to go on? I did the due diligence, Tess said, dropping her weird phrases like she always did. Records seem to indicate that this area was overrun pretty quickly. Other places around the country made good use of their military-grade weapons, but at this location, they didnt get a chance to. All those weapons, I thought, and in the end they did no good. I dont like Ferals at the best of times, but at least we know what they are and to some degree how they operate. Back in the Clean, when everything was just starting to go down, they must have been scared out of their minds. Friends, loved ones, comrades-in-arms, all of a sudden turning into creatures monstrous and violent and, most of all, hungry. At least when Dad Faded I knew what I was dealing with. I had been trained in how to handle myself, in how to handle Ferals. They had no idea. But they soon found out.  All right, people, Cheyenne said. Ante up. I groaned. Really? She gave me a chastising look. Its tradition. Which was true. Zep crews would often select personal items or something from their last haul and put it in a communal pool. The person who performed best during the run (determined by communal vote) would get to take it. Dad and I never did that, even with Claudia. We felt that something earned was yours to keep. Didnt make much sense to add gambling to the mix. But on other crews, I suppose it made a kind of sense. It was incentive to go above and beyond. But I often wondered if it didnt also foster resentment. I wouldnt be surprised if more than a few antes led to murder in the dark. Whats the win condition? Claudia asked. Kills and fills, Cheyenne said, meaning the person with the most kills (assuming there were any) and the most haul. Fine, I said. I grabbed an old plastic box and shook out the dust, three plastic pens and an old razor blade. Then I slapped the box down in front of them. Cheyenne dropped in a knifenothing you would want to fight with, but good for utility work, stripping wires, things like that. Tess dropped in a book, of course, but I didnt look at the title. I was too busy trying to figure out what to put in. You couldnt half-ass itput in something like the pens I had just discarded. But I wasnt putting in something valuable. The idea of this trip was to come away with extra, not less. Mal, who hadnt really said much or reacted in any way when it was announced, simply reached for a ring on one of his fingers (of which there were severalrings, I mean) and pulled one loose. It was silver, and wide, with a large, green stone in the center. It was, strictly speaking, ornamental, but metal could always be melted down. I decided not to give him shit for it. Claudia went next, dropping in a flareuseful and rare enough to be of value. I wouldnt have done it, but I knew for a fact that she had several more. Which left me. I was on the Cherub, which meant I had access to all of my things. The question was, which thing? It came to me a moment latera bottle of wine. I had found a few with Claudia a few weeks earlier. I could put one in and save the rest. The winner could either drink it or sell it. Either way, it was a good score. I grabbed onea Merlotand put it in the bin. Good, Cheyenne said. Were all set. Lets get moving. Ben, if you would be so good as to take your fat baby up into the air? I gritted my teeth and moved to the controls. As I passed Claudia, I said, I am rethinking this whole thing. She patted my shoulder. Its a little late for that, honey. Yeah. The police facility was in what used to be Arizona. Id only been through that area a few times, but it was striking how the land changed. The mountains here were knobby and red, a far cry from the steep, knife-edged, snow-covered mountains I was used to, in the Rockies. The colors of everything seemed to change. There was more desert here, too. That was a good thing when it came to Feralsthey werent really equipped to be out in the desert. Dehydration would still kill a Feral dead like it would anyone. But we were headed to the city, and there were bound to be pockets there. It took us a little while to find the police department and a little longer to find the storage facility where they stored their extra equipment. I didnt mind any of thatwe were in the air. But what came next made me nervous. One of the great things about the Cherub, what distinguished her from a lot of other ships (apart from her name, which was excellent), was that she was equipped with VTOL engines. That meant that, unlike a lot of other airships, which had to either stay in the air or needed complicated launch procedures, she could descend right to the ground for easy loading and then rise back up again, easy peasy. Well, not so easyit was hell to maintain those engines, and thankfully my father had taught me how to do a decent job, but for a long time the Cherub was all I had and I took good care of her. The VTOL was what made the Cherub a great choice for this job. If youre loading lots of guns and heavy gear, you want to be able to walk (or roll, even better) the stuff right up the ramp. There were three problems with this, though. The first was that the Cherub was a large ship. She needed a lot of space to set down. Most of the time, there arent airship-sized landing areas just waiting around. And anything that might have been open like that back in the Clean would probably be covered in vegetation and crumbling stone and debris and what have you. Problem number two was that bringing down a ship her size was going to alert anything living in the immediate area. Including Ferals. And while animals would likely run away from us, Ferals, being slightly more savvy, would probably come toward, aware that there was a delivery of food coming their way. And that brings me to three. Lets say you have the space to put down and you do, and you avoid or fight your way through any Ferals that come to chew on your face. Then, assuming you leave the ship, shes a nice, big target for anyone who might want to steal her. Back then, I used to have a key to lock her up. That key was later lost, and I dont remember the exact details, but as Tess had mentioned, people like Mal werent going to be stopped by a simple lock. I once installed a passcode lock on the controls. You needed to put in the precise numerical sequence to even turn them on. But I ditched that after a narrow escape where those few seconds almost cost me my life. So I had settled for traps. Sometimes the old ways were the best ways, especially in the Sick. They were nothing too elaborate. You had to watch where you put your hands, how you opened things. And I could enable them or disable them as I wanted. I stopped using them later, after I started working with MirandaI was afraid that theyd get her or one of the other boffins. And of course that was when my ship got stolen. But they were enabled for this job. Where do I put down? I asked. Cheyenne walked over to me and pointed out the gondolas window. Thats the beauty. Just across the street? Theres a field. I looked where she pointed, and she was right. A football field. I had no idea how the sport had been played, but Id seen pictures (once, some video this collector had) and something about the way they suited up had intrigued me. The field was mostly clear and large enough to set the Cherub down. Of course there was still a lot of ground between the field and the police facility. Cheyenne looked at all of us, as if reading our minds. Itll be fine. We land on the field, cover each other to the facility. Its mostly open, good lines of sight. After we get the gear, we look for something with wheels to help. If that crashes, we take as much as we can carry. That should be worth enough. But... But? I asked. She looked at Tess. The manifest I have says that they have armored vehicles inside. If theyre vintage, and nothing is broken ... well, well have our way out, wont we? They have armored vehicles? I asked Tess. She nodded. According to the information I pulled. I shook my head. I guess the Clean wasnt exactly what I thought. I brought the Cherub directly over the football field. Okay. Everybody load up and get ready. There was the sound of weapons being checked. I pulled out my fathers revolver, popped out the chamber, and made sure it was fully loaded. I also had a backup automatic on my hip. Claudia tested her bow and inspected her arrows. Someone will have to cover Lord Tess, Cheyenne said. What? I asked. I dont carry, Lord Tess said. What the fuck? I asked. And you think now was the best time to tell us? Its alright, Claudia said. She gave me a look as if to say, just go with it. Ill cover her. Just move when I tell you to, okay? Okay, Tess said. Okay, Claudia said to me. Okay, I repeated. I set the Cherub down.  The howls of Ferals were already echoing across the open space as we descended the Cherubs ramp. I held the revolver in my hand, scanning for any signs of movement. Beside me, Claudia fitted an arrow to her bow. It made me want to grab her and kiss her, but now was definitely not the time. Luckily for us, the field was made out of synthetic grass. Id seen it beforeunnerving that they had such things, but it meant the field wasnt overgrown. Easy place to land, no chance of getting caught up or tripped. I let myself settle into a loose stance, the revolver out, and then they were there, barreling across the open space. I tracked my target, a tall, rangy Feral, male, its long, thin limbs propelling it toward me with worrying speed. I sighted down the barrel. Squeezed the trigger. The Feral still came. I inhaled, sighted, and shot again. The bullet took it in the shoulder as it was coming up from its crouch, spun it around, and threw it backward. I swiveled to another target. Part of me was calmed by the presence of the others. It wasnt that I trusted them (except for Claudia) but they were experienced (except for Tess), and they were covering the places I couldnt coverand for the moment that was enough. I didnt have to look behind me. I suppressed the urge to look behind me. I shot, then shot again, then again and again. The others covered me as I reloaded. The gunshots echoed across the expanse of the football field. Any Ferals in the area would know we were here. That moment of alarm turned to delight as I watched Feral after Feral fall. They should know we were here. Should know that we carried thunder. Should know they were coming to their deaths. The moment of triumph swelled, and then collapsed. Cheyenne, pulling back to reload, slipped on the wet turf and went down on one knee. Mal was also reloading, and suddenly a hole opened up. Ferals are stupid, but not so stupid that they cant sense weakness, and a few of them curved around to come in on that side. And just like that, our order fell to chaos. I had just enough time to swerve the revolver around at a dark-skinned, female Feral that was springing toward me. The shot clipped it and stopped it for a moment, but it wasnt down. Then there was another, then another. Fuck! I heard behind me, but it wasnt Claudias voice. I shot down a young Feral male, dancing away from where it crawled at me. Then another two shots to take the female down for good. Then I was dry. I turned my head for a split-second to see what was happening beside me. Scared, anxious faces. Lots of bullets (and arrows) in the air. Then it was on me. For a moment, my brain couldnt make sense of things. This person had clothes ona leather jacket. The tatters of a scarf. But survival instincts kicked in shortly afterward. I slammed the empty revolver into the side of its head and threw it to one side. Recently Faded. And no time to reload. I did something that I dont normally do. I moved toward it, kicking out with my boot, trying to get some space. I was closer than I ever liked to be, and not armed, and I wanted this thing away. I kicked again, but it dodged my foot, and then I was tipping backward. I hit the ground with my side, and I saw the thing pressing back on its legs, about to jump, and A bullet took it in the head. On an angle so that the spray went wide of where I lay. I looked back quickly to see Mal pointing his gun in my direction. I got back to my feet, took the moment to slap a few bullets into the revolver, then turned and fired at whatever Ferals I could find. It was loud and messy and then ... it was over. Bodies littered the ground. My breath was loud behind my scarf. I counted five of us. All standing. Of course the bulk of my concern was for Claudia. She was breathing hard but seemed uninjured. For a moment, we just stood there, catching our breath, then it was back to reality. Our rational brains quickly took over. I nodded to Claudia, then began checking her for any wounds or blood spray. She did the same to me. She gave me the all clear a moment before I did the same for her. Then I turned and saw Cheyenne. Or, rather, Tess and Mal looking at Cheyenne. What? I asked. She has blood on her gloves, Tess said. One got too close, Cheyenne said. I had to hit it to get it to back off. Are the gloves intact? I asked. Cheyenne held her gloves out, and I could see the dark stain on them. Get them off! I said. She peeled one back with one glove, then gingerly pulled off the other one with a handkerchief she pulled from her pocket, letting it drop on the ground as if it burned her. I moved closer, examining her hands. She held them out, flipped them over. I didnt see any blood. But I didnt touch her. That was always the hardest partI might have checked her hands, checked for broken skin, cracked nailbeds, anywhere the Bug might have snuck its way in. Just because I didnt see blood didnt mean a microscopic drop didnt get through. But, getting close, running my hands, gloved as they were, over her, might just bring me one step closer to Fading myself. It was safer to just keep an eye on her. Prep to put a bullet in her at the first sign of strange behavior. But right then there might have been a bomb in our midst, just waiting to go off. Im clean, Cheyenne said, almost as if convincing herself. Im clean. I looked at Claudia, who just raised her eyebrows. I knew what she was thinking. This was getting better all the time. Lets move, she said at last. She led us around the corpses of the Ferals, then on to the building ahead of us. Claudia noticed the look on my face and touched my shoulder. Itll be fine, she said. Well be in and out before anyone has a chance to Fade. I nodded. Thats what I was trying to focus onget into the facility, grab the gear, get back to the Cherub, and put down Cheyenne (on the ground, I mean) as soon as possible. Otherwise, wed be putting her down in another way. Of course thinking about Fading reminded me about the last person who Faded in front of memy father. It also reminded me of my cowardice. How it took me by surprise, and all I could do was grab for him, my fingers tangled in his Star of David necklace. Then, as reality hit me, what had been drilled into me my whole life kicked in and I turned and ran. Left him, or what was left of him, swirling into an abyss of mindlessness. But thats not the sin at hand. Mal had the heaviest load. We mostly carried empty bags for the loot, but he had his lock-picking tools in his large bag, and so we stayed close to him. What are you really doing here? I asked him. Whatever do you mean, Benjamin? You dont need this score, I said. You hit installations like this all the time. I know youre well-stocked on weapons and ammunition. He stopped for a moment and looked at me. Theres no such thing, Benjamin. One day its going to be up to us to form a new civilization. Not this scattered series of jobs and searches. Not the day-to-day survival that we all do. Were going to need to build something, and that something is going to need defending. So, yes, I do need this score. He started moving again, then said back over his shoulder. We all do. I was still digesting this when I heard howls off in the distance, a sharp cry of ... something? Hunger? Rage? Lust? I dont understand Ferals that much. Ahead of us, the building that Cheyenne had indicated got closer. But not close enough. I still had the revolver down at my side, and I was scanning around me along with everyone else. But we kept moving. We covered the distance without any more Ferals attacking us, and then we were at the door to the facility. Mal set down his bag and unzipped it, pulling out his tools, and the rest of us set up a perimeter around him, guns still out, as protection. I started counting in my head, then stopped almost immediately. It was just setting my nerves on edge. I didnt like waiting, out in the open. It was something I avoided as much as I could. I kept flicking my gaze back to Claudia. She stood, straight, poised, ready. It made me feel better. Having her watch my back always made me feel better. I covered my section of the perimeter, but it was trickier here than it had been at the football field. There were cars outside the police station, and they had been overgrown with vines and vegetation. I had to make sure to keep my eyes not only between them, but underneath as well. A Feral could emerge from anywhere. Sweat started trickling. I had a wool cap on my head and safety goggles and my scarf up, but somehow it still fell between the gaps. There was nothing to do about it, though. I wanted to turn and look to see how far Mal had gotten, but I kept my eyes straight. It was maddening. Thats the thing about the ground, the fight with yourself is often more important than fighting off Ferals. Brave the ground without discipline, and you were asking to be infected. Then I caught it. Movement, off behind a rusted heap that used to be a car. I raised my revolver and watched, hoping to catch it again. Nothing. Nothing. Then ... something. I signaled to Claudia, silently, then moved toward it. She would have my back, and hopefully the others would change their style of cover to make sure that they picked up the slack. I moved, slowly but without hesitation. If it was a Feral, it didnt seem to be hunting. Hunting Ferals screamed and attacked almost fearlessly. For a moment I wondered if it could be some kind of smart Feral, and that was almost too much to consider so I let it go. I inched forward, gun out, used the car for cover, and carefully pivoted so I could see (and shoot if necessary) what was beyond it. It was a Feral, and my finger moved to the trigger but ... then I paused. Something was different here. The Feral was on all fours, moving back and forth in the space between the cars. I couldnt tell what sex it was. Long hair hung around its face, it had no real breasts to speak of, and whatever genitals it had were hidden between its legs. But it moved in an odd, jerky fashion, and sometimes it would stop and its head would arc, almost painfully, in one direction. Injured? I didnt see any open wounds on the creature. As my heartbeat slowed a bit, I thought I heard it snuffling. Then a kind of whining wheeze, soft, but as it looked around. What the fuck was this thing? I wanted to shoot it. I wanted to do it so badly that I had to actively restrain myself from raising my arm and pulling the trigger. But that was the stupid move. A shot would alert any others around that there was food nearby. Instead, making sure I wasnt within reach of the thing, I signaled to Claudia to use her bow. It was quiet enough and would take out the creature quite easily. She moved around to where she could hit the thing. Then, whether it was Claudia accidentally stepping on something, or me, or nothing in particular at all, the Feral looked up. It saw Claudia there, bow outstretched. And it just gave that whine again, jerking its head to the side again. No snarl, no growl, no threatening gestures at all. I think that startled Claudia because she paused for a moment. In that moment, the thing could have leapt forward. Claudias shot might have gone wide, and it could have been on her, or me, before either of us could react. Only it didnt. It stayed in that same position, head jerked to one side, that kind of whining sound coming out of it. Then Claudia put an arrow through its eye and the Feral jerked back, striking the ground, and was still. Exhaling, I gave her a thumbs-up as we returned to the group, but the thought of that Feral stayed with me. I assumed it had been injured at some point. Ferals were susceptible to the same kinds of things that humans were, and some of them were born with problems, but it was pretty well known that if an individual in the pack wasnt healthy enough to hunt or survive on its own, it was usually killed. And eaten. By its own pack. That this one had survived, and how, was a mystery. I thought about that as Mal worked to open the door. Then, after a while of watching and waiting, Claudia signaled to me that it was done. The door was open. Our prize awaited.  Getting to the goods was surprisingly simple. Inside the outer door was a small entryway with what looked like a guard post or reception area surrounded by glass. Then, beyond, guarded by a few more locks, was a large warehouse. Mal got us through the locks, and then we searched the warehouse, alert, most of all, for any signs of Ferals. We found none. What we did find, well, it was a haul for the ages. There were weapons, both small and large, and plenty of ammunition. Armored clothing and protective gear, including helmets and large shields. And, most impressive of all, large armored vehicles, the type that seemed should belong in a military base or stalled somewhere after the Bug hit, pitted with rust and overgrown with vegetation. Their hard, black shells were covered in dust, but I could see the beauty beneath. Like massive, black insectsand everyone knew that insects were some of the hardiest creatures around. Lord Tess whistled when she saw everything. I didnt say anything, but my eyes were wider than I can ever remember them being. Claudia found my hand with hers and gave it a squeeze. Lets get this all loaded and ready to go, Mal said. It snapped everybody to attention, and we began loading duffle bags and backpacks and everything we brought with us. I focused on the smaller arms and rifles since I was most familiar with them. Also grabbed for some grenades and other explosives. Then I decided to shift focus to the vehicles. They werent just impressive, they were valuable. Something like that, fully operational, would be a godsend on the ground, impervious to Feral attacks, and with enough firepower to cover any entrances or exits. I ran to one and pulled open the door. For all its age, it looked virtually unused. They definitely hadnt been able to use this when the shit went down. I climbed into the drivers seat and was immediately bewildered. It was a good deal more complicated than your usual car or truck, which I had learned how to use early onsometimes they need to be cleared from the roads, and sometimes theyre useful for transporting hauls to a ship. I called over to Tess, asking her to come in. Can you figure this out? I asked. She smiled. Piece of cake. I helped her into the seat and then went back to what I was doing. That was Tesss valueshe knew stuff from the Clean. Knew technology, history, how things worked. She made it her business to be an expert on that world, and it made her useful to the people trying to pick amongst its scraps. I filled another bag, and then another. I recognized one of the items as a launcher, used to fire explosives. That went in the bag, too. Benjamin! Tess called. I ran over to where she sat, her coat bunched up around her. What happened? Her smile made lines on the sides of her eyes and mouth. Turn it. She pointed. I reached for the key set firmly in the ignition and I turned it. For a moment, nothing happened, and then the engine coughed to life and emitted a loud, aggressive rumble. I smiled. Good work. She made a mock bow from her seat. I told you I had it. We can load this up and ride it out, I said to the others. If we can drive it around those cars out there, I can get it up the Cherubs ramp. Cheyenne nodded. Its a good idea. Mal frowned. If we can get it out. Ill check, I said. The warehouse had two bay doors for the vehicles to be driven out of, but there was no real way of knowing what lay on the other side. I would have to go out the front and circle around to the doors to see what was there or else figure out another way to get the vehicles out. I moved to Claudia. Can you continue this without me? Im going to check out whats on the other side of those doors. By yourself? Ill be quieter by myself, I said. Besides, I need you to keep pulling loot. I want to win that fucking ante. You know two of those things are ours, right? Its the principle of the thing. So I do all the work while you go for a stroll. I smiled at her. If I get the vehicle, were a lock for the win. Just be careful, she said. I will, I said. And then I grabbed her ass. It was brash, but I was feeling, I dont know, something wild and buoyant inside of me. Since my father died, things had been a struggle. I had Claudia, of course, and she was great, but something had been missing. For me, at least. This was, well, the biggest score I had ever seen. Just the barter from this one score would keep the Cherub in repairs for as long as I would need. It would keep Claudia and me fed for a while. And the loot itself could be used if necessary. You never turned your back on weapons and ammunition. So I was feeling good. Accomplished. Successful. As I turned to go, Claudia grabbed my ass, and I smiled. And yet, while that excitement propelled me to that front set of doors, the moment I stepped out into fresh air, that feeling, the weight of the world and what it was, fell down on me. Hard. And most of that fire guttered out. Not all of it. But most of it. And I suddenly regretted going out alone. I couldnt bring myself to go back in. Not with that group. Maybe if it had been just Claudia and me, but I wasnt going to show weakness in front of the others, so I moved around the building. As quickly, as quietly, and as questingly as I could. I stuck close to the storage facility, hugging the wall so that I had something solid against my back, the revolver down at my side, held firmly and ready for use. One side of the building, then another, passed by without any other movement. I lowered my scarf a bit so my ears were less covered. So I could hear anything coming toward me. Howls, snuffling, the slap of feet against the asphalt. Anything. Those moments are always the worst. You feel dangled like bait, out in the world, daring a hungry Feral to take a bite. Crossing those two walls, all I heard was the hiss of my breath, the thumping of my heartbeat, and the calls of distant birds. That was one of the difficulties listening for any signs of dangerthere were always animals about, it seemed. Birds, wolves, packs of wild dogs. Except for the birds, Id want to avoid any of them. Finally I reached the far side where the large doors were set. There were a few old cars in the way, and the rusted, old hulk of a truck arrowing in from one side. But it wasnt completely blocked. If we could roll a few of the cars a few meters in one direction or the other, we should be able to get through. All the way to the Cherub. A smile curled my lips for a moment. Then faded when I realized I now had to go all the way back. So I retraced my steps, the revolver still at my side, my eyes and ears still alert. Straining, tense, every step of the way. Each moment that passed was a relief. Ground gained. A minor victory. And as I neared the front of the building, I felt, I dont know, triumphant. But as I approached the entrance to the building, something seemed off. I couldnt actually tell what it was at the timejust something itched at my brain. As I neared the door, I heard raised voices. The door was slightly open, too, not completely closed like it had been when Id left. I opened it to a male voice, deep, gruff. Not Mal. Someone I didnt recognize.         THREE Days pass in my cell on the Phoenix, and Im not even sure how many. There are more than a handful of scratches on my mattress, but Ive been a little inconsistent with that. The only good from all of this is that Ive been healing. Slowly but surely. It no longer hurts to breathe or move or sleep, and one of the few things I can do to pass the time is exercise. Its as Im doing some wobbly push-ups on some indeterminable day that the knock comes on my cell door. I stand up and move away from it. It opens to admit Mal, flanked by two of his peoplerough-looking men with rifles slung over their shoulders. Mal nods, and the men grab me, each one on my arm, dragging me to the door. Mal? Dont struggle, Benjamin, he says. Id prefer not to get your blood all over my ship. So would I, I think, but this could be it. He could be taking me away to my execution, despite what he promised Miranda. I lash out at the man on my right with my leg and catch him on the inner thigh. Then I turn and grab for the rifle of the man on my left. If I can get to the trigger I can  My head. Pain. Swimming. I reach for thoughts, and something dark is wrapped around my head and Im moving, feet banging against the ground. As my senses start to come back, I realize Im being dragged down stairs, deeper into the ship. My body wont respond except to tell me about the pain in my ribs, and in my feet, and most of all in my head. Then were through a door and I smell the ocean and fuel and metal, and Im suddenly splashing through a cold so deep that my heart seems to skip in my chest. Then Im dropped into the cold, freezing, smelly water, and I suck in breath and start to shiver. Someone grabs my hand, and something hard is clapped around my wrist. Then another something on the other wrist. Im shivering and spitting and sniffling as the shroud is removed from my head. Im deep in the hold of the ship. Mal covers a solar-powered light that I squint against. Im waist deep in oily, dark water, and each of my hands is cuffed to a pipe. What the fuck? I say through chattering teeth. Mal looks down on me. On the outside he looks as calm and collected as ever, but I can almost see something nasty surging underneath his demeanor. I realize Ive learned to look for those signshe may be charming and civilized, but like a snake he can strike at any time. Or at least thats what I expect from him. Benjamin, Benjamin... Mal shakes his head. I had such dreams for you. So many ways I thought of to revenge myself on you. Elaborate productions, simple, visceral thrills. I wanted it to be ... epic. Or at least poetic. But ... it seems the world has seen fit to choose for me. I go cold. What do you mean? He screws up his face as if he just swallowed something rotten. The Phoenix. Shes experienced ... a mechanical failure. For a moment, a brief flame of hope kindles in my mind. Mals warship has a problem. What kind of mechanical failure? I ask. He slams a hand on one of the metal pipes. These ships ... they naturally take on water. Its something that surprised me when I learned about it. Every minute, every day, some water leaks into them. There are pumps, down below, that pump out the water, keep it at a manageable level. That sounds like a lot of work, I say. It is. This ship is ... a lot of work. If not for the fact that many of the tasks are automated, I dont know that we would have gotten her moving. I have some people who know computer systems. We have this thing hacked and rigged more than a junker. What does this have to do with the pumps? I try to keep my voice level, but its not going well. I keep pulling on the cuffs, a reaction to the cold water, and thats causing them to dig into my wrists. The computer systems are the easy part, comparatively. The Phoenix has some hull damage. Some of it exacerbated by a deficiency in our navigation skills. We lack the ability to haul her out of the water to fix it. The pumps have more to do and now ... some of them have ceased working. Thats your mechanical failure? Yes. He bites the word. Youre taking on water. His pained expression answers for him. And this is ... what? An illustration of that fact? He smiles, ever so briefly. My people and I are going to have to evacuate. After years of preparation, we will abandon this ... ark. The smile returns. We will, but you wont. What? Youre staying right here. Mal... Its not what I would have wanted, but in a way its fitting, he says. And I think it qualifies as poetic. You cant leave me here, I say. His face goes hard, and I can see that his disappointment at this unexpected failure saturates his whole being. Hes defeated by chance, and he doesnt take defeat well. If I push him too much, he might just kill me here. That might be a mercy, I think. Actually, Benjamin, I can leave you here. I can do it easily. And, though this loss pains me in so many ways, this one little piece will give me satisfaction. Beyond measuring. What about your promise to Miranda? I promised her that I would leave you alive until the ship reaches its destination. I am fulfilling that promise. I just didnt expect the final destination to be the bottom of the ocean. Mal... Good-bye, Benjamin, he says. He takes a moment to stare at me, savoring the moment. Possibly the last time he, or anyone else, will see me. Think, Ben, think. But all I see is Miranda. Youll get Miranda off? He is silent for a moment. Then he says, Yes, of course. She hasnt wronged me. Shell be safe. He starts walking toward the stairs, his men flanking him. I nod. Its a shot of relief in a big bottle of shit. A bright spot. Just like Mals bright spot in the shit of him losing his boathe gets to dispose of me in a very fitting way. Even I can see it has a kind of symmetry to it. But what if the ship werent sinking? Wait, I say. You said your pumps were failing. I assume you tried to fix them? Of course, he says, pausing at the bottom of the stairs. Then you need replacements. He sneers at me. We dont have any. Are you looking? His eyes narrow. What do you take me for, Benjamin? Im a forager. Of course Im looking. But Im not hopeful. We did this kind of search before. Most of what we found was below the water, and we had no way of getting to them. What if you could? Good-bye, Benjamin, he says. Then he and his men walk up the stairs, closing the heavy metal doors behind them. Im left in the dark. In the cold water. The smell of it is thick around me. The ship creaks, and I wonder if Ill go insane before the water gets too high. Or maybe Ill freeze. This is not how you end, Ben. You have to get out of here. But how? Think, Ben, think. He needs pumps. Cant find them. But there must be more out there. Somewhere. Who would know? Other foragers? Too risky, and foragers dont share information easily. Information. It touches off something in my mind. A thought bubbles up. Someone who deals primarily in information. Lord Tess. But surely Mal thought about her already? I call out into the darkness. Mal! Mal! No response except the sloshing of water around me. The creaking of the ship. Mal, I think I can help you! Nothing. Could he even hear me through the ship? It could work. It might save the ship. And that might save me. At least buy me some time before I go down. Mal! I scream as loud as I can. My throat hurts with the effort. Everything hurts. I try to work the cuffs, but theyre on tight and the pipes theyre connected to are steady. I gather my breath for one last scream. Its hard with the cold all around me. Mal! I know where you can The door opens. I see a light at the top of the stairs. Mal descends. What are you talking about, Benjamin? he asks. I know how you can get your pumps, I say. My voice sounds raw. You need a knowledge broker. I take a breath. Lord Tess. His face turns sour. No, he says. No? She and I had a ... falling out. What kind of falling out? I ask. I hurt someone she cared about. At my questioning look, he adds, I didnt have much of a choice. He shakes his head. No, she wont help me. Then let her help me, I say. You? Let me go in your place. She likes me. Say what you will, but Lord Tess always had a soft spot for me. I can use that to get her to help you. Hes silent for a moment. You know shes the best knowledge broker around. You know that she can get you what you need. And you know where to find her? She hasnt moved in the last few years. I know where she is. No one touches her because shes too valuable. And you really think that you can get her to help. I smile at him. Through the shivering, it feels more like a grimace. I know I can. He snorts and shakes his head. If you think Im going to trust you, you sustained more damage in that fall than was obvious. Of course not, I say. But you need me. And you need me right now. What I need are new pumps. I can get them. He shakes his head. Ill have to think about it. Then think fast. He looks me up and down. Benjamin, how did you come to be in the ocean in a life raft with the wreckage of the Cherub all around you? I frown. I thought Miranda explained it to you. I want to hear you say it. I consider my words very carefully. I took on some raiders. Out of Gastown. The Cherub didnt survive. A wave of nausea hits me, though Im not sure if its from thinking of the Cherub or from my current predicament. They attacked you? Took out the ship? No, I say. I attacked them. I took out their ships. With the Cherub? Yes. Why? I carefully choose the next wordsI cant tell him about Tamoanchan. Not Mal. Not now. I cant tell him that I was trying to save a whole island of strangers, and a few friends who were on it. Instead I just say, They were after some friends of mine. He raises a thick, dark eyebrow. You gave up your airship, your beloved Cherub, for your friends? Incredulity drips from his words. Things change, I say. He narrows his eyes, chewing on it. Well see, he says. Then he leaves.  I have no way of telling time down here in the bowels of the ship. I shiver and soak up the water. My muscles ache. My jaw, too, from the chattering. I think a lot about Miranda. The last time I was in freezing water was after we jumped out of the Cherub. She was floating in my inflatable raft. I fell into the water. I thought I was going to die then, but I didnt. She was the reason I clawed my way to the raft. Shes been my light in the darkness so many times before. I could use that right now. Then, after some time, Mal returns with his thugs in tow. Ive considered your proposal, he says. And? Ive decided that a slim hope is better than no hope at all. And there it is. Mal loves his ship more than he hates me. Thinking back on everything, he must really love his ship. So youll let me go? There are conditions, he says. Okay... You will leave this ship with a crew of my people who will take you to Lord Tess. If and when you get what you need from her, they will take you to whatever your destination is. Try to run or pull something, and they will kill you quickly and without mercy, understood? Okay, I say. Its not the best arrangementbut it gets me out of this cell and into the air. And it gives me a chance. And what happens when I get back? Pardon me? If I get you your pumps, and they work, and your ship is saved ... Im not going back into a cell. If Im just going to end up the same way, why should I bother? His eyes narrow and the slightest hint of a smile touches his lips. You will bother because if you do not, I will let your friend, Miranda, die. My mouth drops open. Whatever I had been expecting, it hadnt been that. You wouldnt, I say. Wouldnt I? Youre not a killer. That trace of a smile vanishes from his face. Its been a long time, Benjamin. You dont know what I am. You said you had no issues with her. She didnt wrong youI did. He inclines his head. True, but then you went and convinced me that you could get me my pumps. Im not setting you free. Not now. So to motivate you I needed to find something else. Mal... I know you, Benjamin. You are slippery, and untrustworthy, and far from dependable. So I must take ... drastic measures. You dont have to do this. He ignores the comment. Miranda will take your place. Right here. If the ship goes down before your return, then so does Miranda. For a moment, desperation fills me and I try to move forward, pulling at the cuffs. Mal doesnt even blink. Mal wades forward, his face close to mine. You dont know what Im capable of, Benjamin. Not anymore. Fail to return, or take too much time, and Miranda will sink with this ship. Those are my terms. I only then realize that my hands are curled into fists, the nails pressing against my palms. Then I have a condition. Anger touches his eyes. You dont get to make conditions. I insist on this one, I say, biting the words. You put Miranda into this. Then I want to make sure that shes okay. I want to see her. If youre going to use her like this, I need to see her. He tilts his head, considering. Then he nods. Very well. You may see her. Just to confirm that shes safe. But otherwise you must leave immediately. I try to think of a way around this. No matter what, one of us dies. Her if I fail. Me if I succeed. She would have survived, too, if I didnt try to convince Mal. But, what if there are other possibilities? Maybe I can slip Mals people, get free, come back to get Miranda. Or maybe you get yourself killed and you both die, the voice in my head says. Too late now, I think. And it is. Mal now has a chance. With me. And he will hold me to it. Take me to Miranda, I say.  Miranda starts saying my name when she sees me, but it gets lost in this rush of blood in my head, and before I know it Im moving forward and pulling her close to me and holding her tight. The scent of her hair fills my head and some tension in me uncoils and some hope for the future returns. She holds me back, her arms tight before she pulls away. Youre cold and wet, she says. Long story, I say. Im glad to be out of the water and not freezing, but I feel like shit. Let me look at you, she says. She pulls back my shirt and inspects the bullet wound from however many days ago. Then she feels my forehead and then my wrist, quickly finding my pulse. Well, your wound seems okay. I did a good job patching you up. Yeah, I say. Thank you for that. And she did. I mean I still feel some painhell, I was shot and stabbed and all thatbut Im feeling a lot better. Aside from the freezing and the head blow. I think you should hire me to protect you, Miranda says with a smile. I think you might be right. I spend a moment to take her in. Her dark, wavy hair is tied back in a loose, messy ponytail, and her glasses still perch on her nose. Good. I was worried she might lose them in the fall from the Cherub. Her light-brown skin looks paler than usual, and she looks tired, but otherwise she seems to be in good health. Fed, at least. I lose some time staring into her light-brown eyes. She places a calloused hand on my cheek. We dont have a lot of time, I say. Why not? I shake my head. The ship. Its sinking. I know, she says. Well ... I convinced Mal that I could find a way to fix it. What? She looks at me, incredulous. Can you? I think so. How? I have to leave the ship, I say. Go see someone. See if I can find a replacement for his pumps. Youre leaving? One hand is on her hip. The other pushes back a tangle of hair from her face. It was all I could think of, I say. He was going to let me sink with the ship. Miranda exhales noisily and shakes her head. What did you do to him, Ben? Thats not important. Ill tell you all about it later. I put my hands on her shoulders. But you need to knowhes letting me go, but... But what? I hear the edge in her voice, the familiar sound of her realizing that this isnt going to be good for her. Hes using you as leverage. What? Hes going to put you down below. Where the water is coming in. Incentive for me to come back. Quickly. Ben! I know, Im sorry. I never expected that. If I knew thats what he was going to say, I never would have proposed it. But its too late now. He wants to make sure Ill come back, and hell use you to make that happen. Ben... I hear the anger in her voice, and she turns away from me. Ill come back for you, I say. I promise. Im not going to abandon you. Ben Miranda... She turns back to me. Her jaw is set. I know, you plan to come back. To get me. But theres no guarantee that youll be able to do that. And I was working on a way to get you out of here. I told you, Miranda, I didnt expect it to go this way. You never do. Mal wasnt going to let me go. He was going to let me sink with the ship. I know him. He made you a promise, sure, but all he promised to do was to keep me on the ship. He would have done that. Until we both went under. I thought that this way I would have a chance. In return for me. I throw up my hands in frustration. I know. I know. He outmaneuvered me. Mirandas silent. This is the only play I saw that I could make. I know someone. Someone I think can help Mal out. If I can convince her to help, Ill be able to get back here and youll be safe. And at least Ill have bought myself some time. Time to hopefully figure something else out. Who is this someone? Her tone is flat. Clinical. Another person I go way back with. She shakes her head. That doesnt bode well. I can do this, I say. Ill either get help or else Ill figure something out. But no matter what, Im coming back for you. She closes her eyes for a moment. Id like to believe that, Ben. And I know that you want to. But this is a big gamble. It hurts, to be honest. That Miranda doesnt believe in me. Miranda... Ben, she says. Were so close. I have the data from Gastown. I can make some real progress here. And then ... this. Shes talking about data about the Bug that she stole from a lab on Gastown. A group of scientists there were studying it for use as a weapon. Miranda thinks it will help her in her search for a cure. I didnt do this to hurt you, I say. I know, she says. Please believe me, Im not going to let you go down with this ship. I promise you. We both need to make it back to Tamoanchan. I drop my voice low on the name of the island. Its a secret, and I dont want Mals people to find out about it. Tamoanchan is where Miranda and I had been headed when the Cherub went down. Gastown raiders had found out the location of the island and were heading toward it to attack. I managed to take the raiders down, using my airship as a bomb. It stopped the immediate threat, but that doesnt mean that Tamoanchan is okay. The raiders must still have the location of the island. FriendsRosie and Diegowent ahead of us to warn the island, but who knows if they were able to evacuate in time or even where they would go. We have no idea if theyre okay or not. I worry about Sergei and Clay, Miranda says, talking about her colleagues back on Tamoanchan. Theyre also boffins, scientists, out to find a cure for the Bug. We left Sergei and Clay behind a couple of weeks ago now. If the island is in danger, then they are too. Well get back to them, I say. Both of us. Her expression is devoid of any emotion. I hope so. Ill come back, I say. Youll see. She meets my eyes but doesnt say anything. Miranda, I Im interrupted by the reappearance of Mals guards, ready to take me away. Good-bye, Ben, Miranda says. I cant bring myself to say it back to her.  Mal stands before a table, upon which there are several items of clothing. Your clothes, Mal says. Dried from your immersion in the ocean. I didnt do anything about the stains. I reach for my pantsold, worn denimand shed the pants Im wearing, which are thin and shapeless. Being unclothed in front of Mal and his people is strangeIve only ever really been naked alone, or with Claudia, or, far back, with Dadbut putting on my pants, my old, familiar pants, gives me something back. Makes me feel more like myself. Next he hands me my shirt. Its also worn, but thick, soft, warm. It bears a check pattern that used to be dark but has faded to mostly assorted shades of grey. I shrug it on over the t-shirt that Ive been wearing. Your coat, Mal says, didnt fare well during your immersion in the ocean. He holds it up, and I see it warped and peeling like a dying tree. I need a coat, I say. He holds up a hand, placatingly. I know. And though clothing is as valuable as ever, I cant send you out into the world without one. So ... here. He lifts up something long and dark. This should fit you. I take it from him and hold it up. Its different than my previous coat. I worry about its length. I like to keep my legs freeunencumbered. The material isnt leather but something thick. It would be tough to tear through. I guess this is my only choice? I ask. He nods. I put the coat on. Its heavier than my old one, and it falls to my calves. I dont like the feeling of it on my legs. But it fits pretty well and has plenty of pockets to stash ammo or barter in. The collar can be turned up to protect my neck. Good, Mal says. Like thats that. And I guess it is. One last thing, I say. I reach for my old coat and find the Star of David that I had pinned to it. I take it off and pin it instead to my new coat. The pin doesnt penetrate the fabric, but I am able to thread it to one of the fasteners so that it sits over my heart. Mal raises an eyebrow. You were never one for affectations. Things change. He grunts. Then he rummages in a bag and pulls out my fathers revolver. Some things dont. He holds it up by the handle. I couldnt actually believe that you still have this. I narrow my eyes. It has sentimental value. Then immediately regret saying it. If Mal wants to fuck with me, not giving me the revolver would be a good way to do that. Can I have it? Mal screws up his lips. No, he says. Not now. I will give it to your escorts. If its necessary, they will give it to you. However, if you insist on being an irritant or, worse, a problem, then I will instruct them to toss it into the ocean. Are we understood? I nod. Like everything else about this deal, its not as bad as it could be. But its not good. One opportunity will be hard enough to find. More? I just hope his people are lax. I reach down to the coat pockets. Theyre a little lower than my old ones, and a bit deeper. I dont know that they will allow for a good draw. Hold on, I say. I need a holster. Why? Mal asks. You have no gun. I sigh and roll my eyes. No. But if I need to use it, Ill need one. Mal just stares at me. It could be the difference between life and death, I say. And if I die getting you your pumps, then you dont get the pumps. Its not strictly true. But true enough. I see Mal weighing it in his mind. Ill see what I can do, he says. My people will bring you up on deck. He looks down at his hands, splayed out on the table in front of him. Then he meets my eyes again. Good luck, Benjamin. Thanks, I say. Dont take too long. I nod. How long do you think I have? He shrugs. A few days. Three at most. The clock starts ticking.         FOUR FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA In my history of studying the Maenad Virus, I dont think its ever confounded me as much as Ben Gold. Maybe because viruses, even considering mutation, tend to act according to understandable principles. Ben Gold ... not so much. That he left me again is not really very surprising. Ben is very good at leaving. Ben likes to run away. No, Ben likes to fly away. That he did it to try to save himself is one of the few things that makes sense with him. Hes spent a large part of his life trying to stay alive. Its a skill that hes honed to a sharp point. Its just that that skill, and really most of his past life, is at odds with what Im trying to do. In the beginning of our association, I had to convince him to carry my blood samples on his ship. He fought and he bucked. Because he was risking his survival. And yet in the end he came around. Or at least I thought he had. But its really only been a few weeks ago since he left me the last time. Where Ben and I differ ... well, I dont have time to go into all of it, but I see the risk as being worth it for something greater. The risk of dealing with infected blood, or transporting a live Feral, is palatable if it brings us closer to a cure. I thought he had come around to that way of thinking, especially when he sacrificed the Cherub to save Tamoanchan. Hell, he almost sacrificed his life to do it. I thought something had changed. I know he didnt plan to put me in dangerBen wouldnt do thatbut he has this tendency to leave chaos in his wake. Bens impulsive. He makes decisions without always thinking them through. Its one of the things that infuriates me about him. Okay, Miranda. Be honest. Its also one of the things that I like about him. I take longer to make up my mind. Many times when he acts, Ill be making lists, weighing the positives and negatives of actions and positions, calculating percentages. Its the kind of thinking that I need to maintain in science. The truth is that we are often better together, when we can balance one another. Which makes it exceedingly frustrating when he goes off on his own. Damn it, Ben. I often think that he likes to play the hero. Dashing off to risk his life, thinking that hes protecting me when all hes doing is preventing me from doing any good. And the good I can do... The data I took from Gastown is still in my pocket. Every moment that passes, I itch to get it back, compare it to our data, share it with Sergei and the others and see where that takes us. I think it might take us a few steps closer to a cure. I hope to everything thats good, that Ill get a chance to use it.  I didnt really know what to think about the idea of Malik threatening my life. Since I got here, to the Phoenix, hed been nothing but nice to me. Respectful, even. I know that he has a severe problem with Ben, but hed always treated me well. And yet here he was, threatening to send me down with the ship. I knew I needed to confront him about it and get a sense of what exactly he intended. With Ben gone, and the possibility of him failing, I needed a plan to get myself free of this situation. I wasnt going to let the Gastown data go to waste. It would not go down with me. Luckily for me, we have our dinners. I didnt get a chance to fill Ben in on anything, but I wonder if he would have been surprised to know that Malik had been inviting me to dinner on a regular basis since shortly after picking us up out of the water. During the day, I would work on whatever medical issues needed attendingsetting broken bones or irrigating wounds or just bandaging peopleand in the evenings Malik and I would dine together. It seemed perfectly natural to me, of course. I was the one who convinced Malik to save Ben. I was the one working him. At first we talked about what had happened with the Cherub. Then, my skills as a doctor. But after that ... we just started talking. After seeing Ben, and discovering my new status as a prisoner, I expected that to change. And yet, mere hours after Ben left, Malik himself appeared at the door to my cabin. Is it time to go below? I asked. I stood against the wall of the cabin, my arms crossed. Still mad at Ben. Still mad at the situation. That fucker. No, he said. I came to invite you to dinner. Do you normally dine with prisoners? I asked. I prefer the term honored guest. Maybe we can settle on hostage, I said. He smiled. Will you come to dinner tonight? I thought about it. I thought I should say no, but I needed to figure a way out of this. And I needed more data. Also, his food is spectacular. Its always hard to turn down good food. I nodded. Wonderful. He turned to go. I stopped him before he left. Why do you hate Ben? He waved a hand in the air. Id rather not get into those details at the moment. Maybe another time. At dinner? He smiled at me. Perhaps.  I am forced to admit that Maliks dinner arrangements were always impressive. Like always, I was escorted to a private room where he was waiting for me. Just the two of us, a small, intimate table, and lit oil lamps around the room. I think you forgot the food, I said. He smiled. Its being prepared, he said. Please, have a seat. I sat and soon could smell the aroma of the fish and vegetables that were cooking in the nearby galley. My stomach spasmed in anticipation. Malik ate better than anyone I had ever met. That was one of the reasons I kept accepting his invitations. Then Malik opened a bottle of wine. Ive always preferred the stronger spirits, but when I tasted it, I had to admit it was goodsmooth, silky, and yet still having an almost fruity flavor. The conversation turned to me. My background. I started giving him my scientific background before realizing he was asking about something differentethnicity. Why do you want to know? I asked. He shrugged. It doesnt matter, of course. Why would it? Its just that you defy easy categorization. I chose to take it as a compliment. Some people still cling to the importance of ethnicities, but most people couldnt give a damn. What does it matter if your ancestors were English if there was no England anymore? The concern mostly came from zealots and fanatics. I wouldnt have even answered if I didnt think it was an intellectual question. Malik seemed the kind of person who would know aspects of history and nationality. I decided to answer. Im a mix, I said. If I were an airship, Id be a junker. A little of this, something of that. The way I was told, Ive got some Indian, Brazilian, Irish, and French. Thats a lot for the Sick, he said. Youve obviously never been on a science commune, I said. Theres a certain comfort in the fact that everyone understands disease transmission. Romantic attachments are loose and fluid. And you? My mothers people were Muslims, he said. She was raised in the faith. She used to pray to the east several times a day. But you werent raised that way? Things were ... more difficult when I was a child. Partly because of me. I think it became less important. He sipped his wine. Or rather survival became more important. He looked down at his glass, rotated it between his fingers. I thought I saw a dark cloud come over his face for just a moment. Then he covered it with a smile, looking up at me. How did you lose her? I asked. I was being manipulative, pushing on the sensitivity he had just shown, but I needed to gain some ground with him. His face grew tight. He drank a long sip of his wine, then he finally met my eyes. I dont like to talk about it, he said. Suffice it to say that she sacrificed herself to save me. I was old enough to start looking out for myself. But only barely. That must have been hard, I said, holding his gaze. He smiled. It forced me to learn quickly. I learned how to make friends, how to convince people to help me. The smile vanished. And I learned ... other things. My parents both died when I was young, I said, scrambling to cover the gap that seemed to be opening up between us. I only remember fragments of them. My father, his brown hands bent around a microscope. My mother, taking me up in a balloon, a smile on her face. That must have been difficult, Malik said. Having them both taken from you at a young age. I nodded. It was. But I had Sergei. Sergei? he asked. I smiled. He was a friend of my parents. A student of my fathers. He took me in when they died. I felt warmth in my chest, thinking about Sergei. I miss him so much. I hope hes okay. Sergei took care of me. Malik raised his glass. To Sergei. What could I do but raise mine? To Sergei. I felt tears collect in my eyes, but I pushed them away. I wasnt going to show weakness in front of Malik. But I missed Sergei and last I knew, Gastown ships were headed for Tamoanchan, the island where he was. Where Id left him. When we blew up the Cherub, we took out those ships, but what if there were more? Are you okay? Malik had asked. Yes, I said, sipping at my wine. I was just thinking of ... old times. Malik narrowed his eyes and stared at me. What? I asked. I know you told me about you and Benjamin. That you hired him to protect you, but ... why him? Ah, I thought. Here it is. Whatever was between them had sparked this question. I smiled at him. Ill tell you. But in return you have to tell me why you hate him. He regarded me for a long moment. Are you sure you really want to know? Yes, I said, without hesitation. He nodded. Okay, then. So I told him about how I had been researching Ferals, taking blood samples to study Maenad back with Sergei and the others. I told him how on one of those excursions, in Old Monterey, I had been abandoned by the ship captain Id hired to take me. I told him how Ben had found me and saved me from Ferals. He seemed to know what he was doing, so I hired him, I said. I think at first the lure of food and fuel was enough to keep him interested. And now? Malik asked. For some reason, when he asked that, I thought about the kiss. As Ben prepared to throw us out of the Cherub, as we wondered if we were about to plummet to our deaths, he grabbed me and kissed me. I kissed him back. It was a good kiss. Probably an 8 or a 9 out of 10. It was a very good kiss. I think Bens changed, I said. He believes in more than himself. Malik smirked. I dont believe that someone like Benjamin can change. Everything changes, I say. Its a fundamental fact of nature. Malik tilted his head in agreement. And yet the bacterium changes in but a few moments. The stone, the mountain ... a lifetime. I think Benjamin is of the latter kind. It was a good point. I had to give him that. What did he do to you? I asked. And so he told me. I still wish I hadnt asked.  My efforts with Malik were blunted by his story about Ben. I am still digesting it. Trying to reconcile it with what I know of the man whom Ive spent most of the past few months with. Do I really know him? Has he really changed? And now, of course, Im frustrated by my lack of effect. Any moment now, Maliks people are going to show up to escort me into the bowels of the ship. This was my chance to find my way out and I failed. What can I do, trapped below? For better or worse (and it feels very worse), my fate seems tied up in Ben. And I have to hope that he does what he says he can. I dont feel very confident. I can hear them at the door. My time is running out. Ben ... please come through.         FIVE To be honest, I never thought I would be so unhappy to be back in the sky. I love being in the air, its where I belong, but, well, not like this. I know, I knowmy dad used to say something about beggars not being choosers, but Im aboard a strange ship, and I cant fly her or even navigate, and I feel powerless. The ship is called the Raven and her captain is a zep named Whistler. Whistler was probably born a woman, based on bone structure, but now eschews gender altogether. Its not uncommon in the Sick where sex is a potentially deadly prospect. Or, who knowsmaybe Whistler was just born that way. Thats not my problem with Whistler. My problem with Whistler is that Whistler has been in my face since this whole thing started. Seems that Mal wasnt exaggerating when he said his people would be on top of me the whole time. Whistler wears a lot of leather, which adds to the hard image. A metal cuff, lots of piercings, and big, black boots complete the picture. Hair, short and dark, sits messily on Whistlers head. The perpetual scowl, I think, is mostly in response to me, but who really knows? I give them Lord Tesss location, the San Francisco Public Library, hoping that doing so wont piss Tess off, but how else am I going to get there? Chang, Whistlers second-in-command, a rough-looking fellow with a shaved, scarred head and a wispy mustache, lays in the course. When did both of you hook up with Mal? I ask. Fuck you, scavenger, Whistler says. Ship captains these days have no manners. Take us in from the south, Whistler tells Chang. Weve seen ships flying the route to the north. What kind of ships? I ask. Shut up, Whistler says. This is going to be a delightful trip. If this is a trap, Whistler says, just know that the first thing Im going to do is put a bullet in the back of your head. Whistler carries a large handgun strapped to one leg. One shot from that would leave tiny pieces of my skull and its contents all over the place. Its not a trap, I say. Lord Tess is a knowledge broker. Shes open to anyone. Shes valuable enough that people leave her alone. Its best to just let the information flow. Truth be told, I hope thats still the case. I thought I knew how the world worked, and then everything went upside down on me. Gastown, the big city in the sky, was supposed to be the start of a new era, the seed of a new society. That had been enough to make it untouchable until raiders out of Valhalla, a sky city back east, took it over. I thought all they wanted were the resources, and the helium the city in the sky had, but when I looked a little closer, seems they were working with a group of scientists I call the Cabal, who were experimenting with the Bug. Everythings different now, everythings crazy. Since the people on board hate me, I focus my attention on the ship. The Raven is longer than the Cherub was, thinner, but the Cherub was sleek, smooth, like a wide, slightly flattened bullet. The Raven is somehow blockier and gives the appearance of awkwardness. Still, we appear to be moving at a decent clip. Shes also armed, which is something I never really went in for. But Mals people do. He always thought that it mattered. The two gunners on board dont like me either. Inside, the Ravens pretty spareWhistler commands from the rear of the gondola with a good view of the ships surroundings through the windows that ring it. Its mostly gray metal, with a few reinforced panels bolted onto it. Chang sits in front of the controls closer to the front of the gondola. Some kind of personal objecta bit of netting with some crystals or jewelry attached to ithangs from the right arm of his seat. I think about asking him what it is but then dont. Id probably get another fuck you or fuck off or die, you fuck. Did Mal tell you all to hate my guts? I ask. No, Whistler said, we did that all on our own. I dont get as much lip from Chase and Orkney, the other two members of the crew, but thats mostly because theyre off manning the large guns, one on each side of the Ravens shell. I had entertained brief thoughts of overpowering the crew. Taking control of the ship and forming a plan to rescue Miranda, but I would only chance it if I knew I could succeed. And even though there are only two people here with me, one of whom is flying the Raven, I still cant chance it. Mirandas life is at stake. So I wait. You said its a library, Whistler says. Yes, I say. Thats a place where they used to keep books. The stare that Whistler gives me deserves its own caliber. So this woman has access to all of these books. Yes. Then why do people need her at all? Why not take the library and the books as well? I sigh. Its not about the books. Even if you can read, do you know where to find what youre looking for? Do you want to read through book after book to find it? Whistlers face contorts into a sour expression. Thats what Lord Tess offers. She will get you the information. Sometimes by checking a book. Sometimes by trading information someone traded her. I think she even has some working computers in the place. But what she offers isnt the books. Its the service. And youre sure she can get us those pumps? Yes, I lie. I dont know for certain. This might be something Tess cant do, but Ive risked it all on this one shot. And unlike Mal and me, or Mal and Tess, Tess and I have good history. I think shell do what she can to help. You better hope youre right, Whistler says. Chang nods, silently. Ive been thinking the same thing. So ... Hawaii, I say. Whistler glares at me in response. You going to become, what, farmers? Live off the land? No response. Sorry, but you guys dont seem like the type. Mal said he wasnt very smart, Whistler says. I get the feeling its directed at Chang. Sorry, I say. But were zeps. Are you really going to be happy down on the ground like a plod? Giving up the sky? Whistler turns to face me. The sky aint what it used to be. One hand clenches into a fist. Do you know what the lifespan is for the average zep? All of us are past it. Living on borrowed time. Flying from one dangerous situation to another. Risking our lives again and again. What Malik has given us is a better chance. A chance to find our own place. In a paradise with good weather and the chance to grow our own food and maybe die of old age instead of in a firefight, or getting clipped by a Feral or because the ship loses an engine. I can only swallow in response. Im not naive enough to think that its going to be easy, Whistler says. But I am willing to give it a chance. Why wouldnt I be? That shuts me up for a while.  The San Francisco Public Library is a pretty boxy building. Im sure it looked nice back in the Clean, but its stained and worn, and all the glass has been boarded up now. Two guards stand outside, in a metal cage, armed with rifles. The cage protects them from Ferals, and also keeps us out. Us, in this case, is me, Whistler, and Orkney. Whistler tasked the knobby, bald gunner to be one of my escorts and insisted on coming with me. They were afraid Tess would shelter me. I cant say the thought hadnt occurred to me, but here we are. We stand outside the cage, out in the open, on the ground, as the Raven circles above us. In the rain. Were here to see Lord Tess, I say, wiping wet hair from my face. Im an old friend. The guards dont talk much, but they let us into the cage, one operating the door, the other ready to unload if necessary. Once were in, we hand over our weapons (and get patted down just in case). Then they secure the cage and open the doors to the library proper. No tricks, Whistler hisses in my ear as we enter. I can still put you down, even without my gun. Just let me do the talking, then, I say. We go way back, but she doesnt know you two from Feral shit. It strikes me as were walking from the hallway into the library that we are extremely vulnerable. If Tess werent here, for example, this would be a great way to strip visitors of weapons and then use them for whatever nefarious purpose you wanted. I dont know for sure that shes hereonly that she was here last time. Easy, Ben, I think. Dont get paranoid. The place is dark, with plenty of side corridors for attackers to hide in. Our steps echo off of the ground, which is remarkably well preserved. Its old, and musty, but cleaner than most old buildings Ive been through. I wonder how much blood this floor has seen. As we move down the hallway, steps begin echoing toward us from the opposite direction. Attendants? I dont remember them from last time, but maybe the operation has grown. My blood chills when I see whos approaching. Two people, one tall, one of medium height. The tall one is a woman with a large nose and a square jaw. Her companion is clean-shaven, with pock-marked cheeks and a pale complexion. She wears a shirt made of metal links, and on top of that is a kind of scarf or shawl that seems assembled from feathers. Maybe vulture or eagle feathersblack and long. Her head is shaved except for the very top, and the hair is pulled into a long tail held in place with metal rings. Her companion wears a fur vest on top of a loose shirt, but I can see the muscles bunch beneath it. A long scar on the top of his head divides his short hair into two parts. Hes wearing a necklace, too, and I think its teeth strung together. Some long and pointed. Others, short and blunt. Like human teeth. My blood chills because their appearances mark them as being from Valhalla, the floating city in the east. For a long time, Valhalla was the only city in the sky, and then Gastown was created. Gastown was a free city, a city of trade, a city trying to bring civilization back, lift it off of the ground and into the sky. It was also a city that had access to helium. Then the Valhallan raiders attacked and took it over. Turned it into a fiefdom of Valhalla. Used it to launch raids and attacks. Used the helium to lift their own ships, and bartered what was left for exorbitant prices. It was Valhallan raiders who attacked Mirandas last headquarters, the Core, and killed some of her people. It was Valhallan raiders who stole the Cherub. It was Valhallan raiders who were on their way to attack Tamoanchan. My hand reaches down to my holster for my revolver, but ... its not there. Were fucked, I think. Theyve taken over Tesss operation as well. I tense, getting ready to do ... I dont know. Something. Anything. I put out a hand to halt Whistler and Orkney. We stop. The Valhallans approach, their eyes flicking over us, their faces blank. Take out the woman first, I think. Hope the others take the man, then run back to the cage with any weapons we can strip. Im formulating this plan, and then... The raiders pass us by. They dont pause. They dont stop. Were less than buzzing flies for all the attention they pay to us. What was that? Whistler hisses. My pulse returns to normal. The energy bleeds out of me. Nothing, I say. Never mind. I continue on, and then were there, in the audience chamber in the San Francisco Public Library.  Lord Tess was old the first time I met her, so shes positively ancient now. Shes also remarkably well-preserved, especially in a world where the average life expectancy is something you can count on your fingers and toes. The story goes that she actually remembers the Clean, or at least had a parent who lived in it and so knows more about it than most people. Looking at her, I can believe it. Her face is pale and a mess of wrinkles. She keeps her hair short and doesnt wear a scarf or anything on her face aside from the large, dark glasses that cover her eyes. She wears a dark sweater that covers her neck and some kind of shawl around that. Her pants are thick and loose, and she wears thick slippers on her feet. She sits in a large, comfortable-looking throne, draped all over with blankets and old rugs. Books stand in tottering, old piles around her. The throne sits in a large, open space in the library. Above her, a mostly still-intact skylight sends light down to us. Most of the other glass has been boarded up, especially at the lower levels, but she left the skylight intact. Its something of a wonderglass doesnt usually survive long these days. On the levels above us, on little balconies, stand some of Tesss guards. She may be too valuable to touch, but that doesnt mean shes stupid. Right now they probably have guns trained on us. Precision weapons. If they want us dead, were dead. But were old friends, I keep telling myself. I like libraries, though. Goes hand in hand with liking books. A lot of the places Ive come across have been wrecks. Books burnt or waterlogged. Yet there are always treasures to be found, even in places like that. They can be sad places, though. Take the Seattle Public Library, for example, up north. I found a picture of it once in an old magazine. It looked like something out of a dream. But, these days ... Like I said, glass doesnt usually survive these days. Standing next to Tess is a young man with dark skin and a mess of short, spiky dreadlocks on his head. His face is uncovered, and he appears unarmed. Tess claps her wrinkled hands together. Well, well, well, she says. If it isnt Benjamin G. Gold. I smile at her. Glad to see you remember me, I say, wishing I had never let slip my middle name. Not even Miranda knows that. She smiles, and it crinkles her cheeks into a mess of fault lines. I remember everything. Some things dont change, I say. Yet I think you have. She crooks a finger at me. Come closer. I do. The glasses are thick lenses inside thicker plastic frames. Glasses always impress me, as rare as they are, but on Tess they dont surprise me. She looks me up and down. Well, youre in trouble, but thats a given or else you wouldnt be here. She squints. Youve been through something harrowing recently. And ... theres a woman. Now how the hell would you know that? I ask. She smiles again. That ones easy. You have a long, wavy hair stuck to your beard, as if you had embraced someone recently. That could have been a mans hair, I say. She holds up a liver-spotted finger. Sometimes you just have to play the odds. Who is she? She is none of your concern, I say. Im here for information. She gives me a disgusted look. Of course you are. Thats why people come to me. I dont just sell knowledge, I trade it. You know that. So ... whats her name? Miranda, I say. Ah, she says. Back in the Clean, there was a singer named Carmen Miranda. She used to wear fruit on her head. Now why in the hell would you know that? A commission. For a rather ... wealthy client. Fascinating, I say. But Im not paying for that. She laughs and it sounds like a wet cough. What does she do? Is she a pilot? No, wait, shes not. What does she do, my boy? I grit my teeth. This is all part of the dance, I know, but Im eager to get on with this thing. Shes a scientist. Lord Tesss eyebrows lift. She smiles. That is a treat, young man. What particular flavor of Biology. Virology. Shes studying the Bug. She gets a contemplative look on her face. Some things do change, she says. Well see, I say. What is the nature of your relationship? What? What is she to you? She used to be my employer. She holds up her finger again. Used to be. What is she now? Its a good question. One Im not sure of the answer to. I think back to the kiss we shared before we jumped out of the Cherub. A friend, I say. A comrade-in-arms. She frowns. I thought you said she was a scientist. She is. But were in the same fight. Against? The end, I say. Her smile returns. I dont think youre telling me everything, Benjamin. I think theres more there, more stones to turn over, and some valuable finds beneath. Im telling it straight I say. You do know that theres this little light that comes into your eyes when youre talking about her, dont you? Its clear shes special. If thats true, keep her close. The Sick doesnt like special people. It tries to stamp them out. Theres an underlying sadness to her words, and I suddenly realize that she once had someone special. And lost them. Id love to hear the particulars of her life, but the truth is that I couldnt afford it. So what is it that you want? she asks. And here we are, where I need to be, and yet I cant stop thinking about the Valhallans that just left here. Youre keeping interesting company these days, I say. What? The two that left before us. She snorts. You know I dont take sides. If you can trade for what you need, I give it to you. Just like that. She nods. This is a business. She smiles. Now Im telling it straight. I sigh. It makes me uneasy, but this is what I came for. I need help. Fast. Theres a ship. A military ship, and its sinking. The pumps that keep the water out, at least some of them, have stopped working. I need replacements. And quick. Before the boat sinks. Uh-huh, she says, nodding. She shifts in her chair, and I catch a quick grimace of pain. I just have one question. Go on. Her face loses all trace of humor. Why do you think I would help our old friend Malik? I stare at her. How did you Tattoos. His people tend to get them. Your escort has one on his wrist. Orkney. I remember seeing that mark on his wrist when he rolled up his sleeves. A flame, I think. Or maybe a star? I turn to look at him. Hes not paying attention. His eyes are on the shooters above us. Shit. Hold on, now, I say. Let me explain... Do you know what he did? He came looking, after what happened back in Arizona. I thought he was dead. But he showed up here one dayone of the drawbacks of people knowing where to reach meand he was Mad, I say. Mad would be an understatement. He came in here full of threat and swagger. And when one of my people tried to get in his way... I can see her hand trembling at her side. Hes lucky he made it out alive. Im sorry, I say. Whats almost more surprising is why hes working with you after what you did. You know how it is, I say. He needs something, I know how to get it for him. And what do you get in return? I pause. I get to keep on keeping on. Youre going to have to tell me the whole story. I loosen my scarf just a bit. Its a long story. Uh-huh, she says. I have time. I turn and look back at Orkney and Whistler. Orkneys scratching his stubbly head. Whistler is staring at me. Perhaps you two could leave? Lord Tess says, directing it toward them. No way, Whistler says. He doesnt leave our sight. Tess gives me a sad look as if to say, I tried. I tell her. First everything from the destruction of the Cherub onward, and then she starts asking me about how that happened, and I go farther back, telling her about how I hooked up with Miranda and her team, about how Gastown raided the boffin base, about how I lost the Cherub, ended up on Tamoanchan, how I got the Cherub back but how I had to stop the raiders on their way to the island. Im not telling you the name of the settlement or where it is. I say. I know all about, she leans in and whispers, the T word. What? How? Knowledge broker, remember? I narrow my eyes. Would you sell that information? She stares at me. This is my business, she says, her voice hard. And I dont need to explain or elaborate about how I run it to you or to anyone. I provide a service and I have for a long time. Its a service valuable enough to keep me protected. I just stare back at her. Shes not going to tell me and I still need information from her. After a long pause, she continues. There is an art to this. I know, for example, that the location of ... that place ... is a valuable commodity. I also know that were I to sell this location to some in this world, they would attempt to raid the island or even destroy the settlement there. As such, the value of that knowledge would decrease as would the number of customers and sources that I currently have available to me. So that is something I have to weigh heavily. I get it, I say. And I do, of course. But Im not under any illusions. I trust that Tess will keep the information secret ... only until a better offer comes along. Shes not a saint. I need to keep reminding myself of that. So youre looking for the location of replacement pumps, she says, finally. I take a breath. Yes. Its to help Mal, yes, but theres more than that. He has Miranda. Shes aboard the ship. If I dont get back in time to fix it, well... She shakes her head. Youre still asking me to help Malik. I lower my voice. This arrangement is temporary. Hopefully so is my time there. Im basically a prisoner. Believe me, I am going to do everything I can to find a way to ... part ways. So? So ... like you said, Mal and I arent friends, either. At some point hes going to get whats coming to him. And you want me to keep you alive long enough so that you can do it. Thats about right. She chews a thin lip. Pumps, huh? I nod. And I came to the best knowledge broker in the world to help me. She shakes her head. Thats laying it on a bit thick, dont you think? Can you help me? I ask. She holds up her finger as if to stop me. Do you have the details on the ship? I nod and fish out a crumpled piece of paper from my pocket, the specs that Mal gave me. She looks the paper over. This is beautiful penmanship, Benjamin. Thank you, I say. Can you help? I think I might. I just need to consider for a moment. Wait here. She gets up from her seat, shuffles off into a back room, through a large, thick curtain. Shes using a cane these days, I see. I wonder how many years she has left in her. And what happens to all that knowledge when she goes? I turn and smile at Whistler. Isnt this fun? I ask. Whistler scowls back at me. Orkney smiles at me. Hes missing several teeth. A right laugh, he says. I look at the young man. Whats your name? I ask. Rufus, he says. Hi, Rufus, I say. Im Ben. I know, he says. I shrug. Whats your job here? I assist Lord Tess in her research. I nod. Its a good idea, getting others to help her. To be her eyes and fingers. I suppose that makes him next in line for the throne. Hes learning the ropes. Smart move. But then Tess only seems to make smart moves. Except for that one time back at the police storage unit. How long is this going to take? Whistler asks. It takes as long as it takes, Rufus says. It sounds rote, like hes said it or heard it plenty of times. Some of Tesss commissions must take days. Weeks, even. But hopefully not this one. Youre welcome to wait back on the Raven, I say. Whistler scowls at me. Is she doing okay? I ask Rufus, gesturing in the direction of where Tess disappeared. Yes, he says. Shes a tough old bird. I think I hear a note of disappointment in his voice. Tess shuffles back out a few moments later. I believe I can help you. Relief drops my shoulders and shakes some of the tension away. Thats good news. I turn to Whistler and Orkney. Hear that? Good news. Theres a naval base, Tess says. They should have the replacement parts that you need. Where is it? She holds out a paper. On it are some coordinates. Washington, she says. The locations there. Its not the best of news. I was hoping for closer. So we just have to do some foraging? I ask. Not exactly, she says. The base is ... inhabited. Oh. They should be willing to barter with you. My information tells me theyre reasonable. But... Yes? Theyre a little strange. Eccentric. They may need a little convincing. I shrug. Im used to the boffins. Eccentric describes them just fine. And Ive been doing a lot of hustling lately. Their leaders name is Danning. Captain Danning. Its written down. Thanks, I say. I need you to do something for me, though, she says. Your story, as interesting as it was, doesnt pay for this. I nod. What do you need? Whatever information you can give me about the facility. The layout. The names of the people there. Defenses. So on. Why? I ask. Are you thinking of attacking it? Its information, Benjamin, she says as if speaking to an idiot. Its kinda my job. Okay, I say. Ill do what I can. And then were even? She narrows her eyes. If the information is good, then yes. Okay, I say. I press my palms together. Thank you. For putting the past aside for now. I turn to Whistler and Orkney and wave the paper at them. We have our location. Good luck, Benjamin, Tess says. Im about to walk away, then I think of something. One last thing, I say. Any news out of Gastown? Tess tilts her head. Interesting question. Why so interested? I shrug. No particular reason. Had some friends headed out that way recently. Just was wondering if it had gotten crazier. She nods, seemingly satisfied with that answer. Seems like they had a bit of trouble lately. On the city? I ask. On the city and down at their helium plant. I heard they sent a big group of their people and ships down to investigate and protect the plant, and while they did, something else went on in the city. Theyve severely restricted access to the city while they deal with it. Ships cant even get in. I try not to smile. Knowing that we threw a wrench into the works there makes me happy. But I still worry about Tamoanchan and retaliation. Thank you, I say. Dont worry, she says. Youll pay for it. Eventually. And thats the problem, I think. Eventually, the cost will always catch up to you. And in the end it always ends up seeming greater.         SIX The good thing about the location of the naval base is that its pretty much a straight line north from Lord Tess. Still, judging on the Ravens speed and the distance, its going to take us a good ten hours or so. Ten hours of being with the happy fun brigade. I feel somehow like Im back in the ocean, bracing for waves. Just when ones passed, another is on the way. My job is to keep my head above the water. If I sink, Miranda sinks. Literally. But what Tess said to me is making me nervous. Theyre a little strange. Eccentric. They may need a little convincing. If Whistler holds true to form, Ill have escorts down there, which means my hands will be tied. On the other hand, Im somewhat glad for the backup. This is one of those cases where the enemy you know is better than the enemy you dont. Im almost feeling okay with the situation when I feel the Raven start to slow and then shudder to a stop as the anchor is dropped. What the hell is going on? I ask. Storm, Chang says. Gotta wait it out. I run to the gondola window, look out at the dark clouds ahead of us. Can we go around? No, Whistler says. We wait. The clouds are dark and thick, and Im sure the wind is picking up out there. Its the safe thing to dothe storm could easily blow us off course. As I look, lightning stabs through one of the clouds. Tick tock. Tick tock. If this were the Cherub, I might chance it. Her engines were strong and she was sleek, and if I could skirt the edge just right ... But the Raven isnt the Cherub. Shes got those two guns and shes clunkier. And I dont know how good Chang is at flying her. So ... we wait until the storm clears. Hours pass. I spend most of the time pacing the Phoenixs gondola until finally sitting against one wall, knees up, trying not to think about Miranda. Then, after what feels like an eternity, Whistler gives the order to raise the anchor and we begin to pick up speed. The timing means that were going to arrive at the base in the early morning. Which means at least well have daylight. Every moment that passes, the Phoenix sinks a little more and Miranda moves closer to a watery grave. I start running calculations in my headhow long it will take to get there, how long it will take to get back. The unknown is how long it will take to get the pumps. Best-case scenario, we make a quick deal and get on our way in just a few hours. The Raven is loaded with barter to help broker the deal. And I have to admit that Mal was smart. Theres food, equipment, metals, weapons. Enough to get some kind of deal together. I hope. Because this is going to be the hardest part. Because these people are strangers, and I dont know what they want or how theyre going to react. As difficult as Mal is, I know him, and I know, now, what he wants. Were headed into uncharted territory. I dont want to let Miranda down.  We cant fly directly over the base because of the risk of anti-aircraft guns. Its a base, after all. Theres no way of telling if the artillery works except to risk being hit by it, and that doesnt really appeal to any of us. Instead, Chang drops us off well outside the range of the guns and we move in. We is Whistler, Chase, and me. Orkney stays on board the Raven with Chang as backup. Someone needs to man the airships guns if it comes to that. So we plod it to the bases edge, not too quickly but not slow either. Right now were on the ground and in the open, and that makes us easy prey for Ferals. Im armed with my fathers revolver. Right now, its strapped to my right thigh, where it belongs, in the holster that Mal got me. I managed to convince Whistler to give the revolver back to me since we were going into a potentially dangerous place and me having it meant one more for the team. Its lower than Im used to, which will change my draw style, but its better than fishing for it in these coat pockets. Whistler seems to be settling in to the idea that Miranda matters to me and so Im not going to try to get free at the first opportunity. Whistler is right about the first thing, not about the second. But I have the gun back, and thats smooth flying. Chase is the Ravens other gunner, a tall, thin woman with short hair and a pale complexion. Her hair is long on the top and shaved on the sides, a reddish shade of blonde. Theres something about her that seems a little unpredictable, but then I dont know her very well. Chase has a sawn-off shotgun that she calls Sully in a makeshift sling across her back. I dont know what Whistler has beneath the long coat. But were all armed, and thats something. Odds are, though, that the base is holding more than just a few people. We move in a coordinated fashion, the first time either Whistler or Chase have treated me as one of theirs. But the threat of Ferals has a way of bringing people together. Whistler moves forward, eyes on the base, and Chase and I scan around us, looking for anything moving toward us. I was going to insist on being the one out front, but I trusted myself more on Feral duty. If only I had eyes in the back of my head. We move steadily, persistently, closer and closer to the base. I want to look at it, but that would mean taking my eyes off of my area, and I dont much feel like doing that. I am being forced to trust Whistler, and its a tough piece of meat to swallow. Instead, I scan the overgrown road and the trees and the space between them. I wipe sweat from my forehead. Then I hear Whistler say, Stop. And I do. The area looks clear, so I spare a glance for the base. Four figures in matching uniforms face us with rifles aimed right at us. Theyre behind a gate with bars close enough to keep us from getting in but perfectly fine for letting their bullets right out. I put my hands into the air, and Whistler and Chase do the same. This is your show, Whistler hisses. I move forward ever so slightly. Please, I call out. Were here for your help. We have barter. Can you take us to Captain Danning? Three of the people dont budge at all, keeping their weapons trained on us. The fourth moves to the gate and opens it. A sense of relief fills me. Still, Im ready to reach for my pistol if I need to. When the gate is fully open, the one guard waves us in. I move forward, making sure that Whistler and Chase move in behind me. When we pass the boundaries of the gate, the three guarding us shift positions so that they have better shots on us. Two are women, one is a man. The one on gate duty closes the gate again. When thats done, the gate sealing with a loud clunk, he comes over to me. I need to check you for weapons, he says. Hes tall, lean, dark-skinned. Hes surprisingly clean-shaven, well-groomed. He pats me down and removes my fathers revolver. Then he moves to Chase and Whistler, confiscating Sully and several weapons from Whistlera pistol and a large blade that I think is a machete. He also takes a few things that look like blocks from Chase. All of these he secures in a guard station by the gate. Then he orders two of the soldiers guarding us to escort us to the captain.  They take us to a large, outdoor courtyard surrounded by a chain-link fence. I try to take in as much as I can of the base, hoping to describe it for Lord Tess later. More guards wait for us in the courtyard, because of course there would be more of those. Is Captain Danning meeting us here? I ask. Then light explodes across my eyes, and it takes a moment to realize that Ive been hit in the head. Next thing, I feel a pressure on the back of my knees, and I go down to a kneeling position, landing hard on my knees. Something is pulled down over my head and tightened around my neck so that I cant see, then another blow hits me in the head and I lose everything for a few moments. When I come back to myself, Im being dragged backward, someone on either of my arms, securely holding me beneath my armpits, and my hands are tied or somehow restrained behind my back. Fuck, I think to myself. I could struggle, but theres two of them, I cant see, and they are armed. Im not. And with the way my head feels, I dont even know if I would have my balance. Fuck. Then, as Im running scenarios through my head, I get tossed down onto the ground, and I hear a heavy door close. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I find myself starting to growl, a sound that builds until its a deep scream. From one cell into another. And all the while Miranda is stuck aboard the Phoenix. This is not how its supposed to happen, I think. And then I start to laugh. I cant help myself. Great eruptions of laughter bubble up from deep inside of me. Did you really think the world was going to change for you, Ben? It took us a handful of hours to get to Lord Tess. Then the rest of the day and night to get to the base. One whole day used up, and Miranda only has maybe two more. Tick tock. Tick tock. The water keeps rising. The inside of the bag on my head smells like old sweat, and I try really hard not to think about who wore this last and all the fluids they left on the inside. Its old sweat, I tell myself. Even if infected, the Bug would have died out ages ago. I keep telling myself that. And I keep thinking of Miranda. Of her aboard Mals warship, the water getting ever higher. God, Miranda, theres so much we need to talk about. I keep thinking back to that kiss we shared, just before I dropped us out of my airship. That kiss that seemed to speak of months of feelings we never acknowledged. I mean, it kind of snuck up on me. I always thought Miranda was pretty, in a sort of earthy, rough-around-the-edges way. She was nice to look at, and I thought that was it. But it seems like something else had been building. First admiration and appreciation, then something more. Now ... where are we? What are we to each other? I find that I really want to know. But I need Miranda for that. Think, Ben, think. If nothing else, that should be your mantra from now on. I test my bonds againthey seem to be secure. That makes sense. These people are on a military basethey would have access to good equipment. I scoot back on my butt until I hit the wall, and I get myself to my feet. I may be trapped, but I dont need to be a victim. Using my hands, I slowly move around the circumference of the room, trying to figure out how big it is, see if theres anything else in here with me. Its slow going since my hands are behind me, but I manage to do it. Its not a typical cell, at least not compared to those Ive seen in police facilities. There are no bars. Just hard walls and a door. The door doesnt appear to have any openings in it, though I guess there must be some kind of window, so that they can look in without opening it. Only its too high for me to feel with my hands restrained. Im racking my brain for my next move when they come for me. The door clacks and opens, and as I start to speak, my voice muffled by the bag, two people grab me by my armpits and drag me out of the door. For a brief moment, I think about trying to struggle, trying to get lucky and make a break for it, but I cant see and Im restrained and they can and arent. And Im guessing theyre armed. No, Ben, I tell myself. Bide your time for now. And hope theyre not taking you to an execution. Im getting really sick of biding my time. They march me down what Im guessing is a corridor, then around a bend, then into another room. They force me into a chair, two of them holding me down, and with quick, practiced movements, they release my hands, pull them behind the back of the chair, then latch them up again, I think securing them to the chair. Then I hear footsteps recede. A moment later, the bag is pulled away and I blink in the light. A woman, pale-skinned, tall, and wearing a uniform, takes a seat opposite me. Her uniform is different from the others I saw. More formal. Tan in color. There are flecks of color on her collar. Some sign of rank, I guess. My name is Captain Danning, she says. Im in charge here. Well, Captain, I think theres been some kind of misunderstanding here. I came, with my friends, to ask you for help. Lets have your name first, she says. I sigh. Ben. Ben Gold. Very well, Ben, she says. You say you came here for help. What kind of help? Im in need of pumps. The kind that keep a ship from taking on water. I realize I dont know what theyre called. I was told you had some here. Her eyes narrow. And you expected me to just hand over these pumps to you? No, I say, hoping I sound suitably appalled. Im not naive enough to expect charity in the Sick. We came with barter. Captain Danning tilts her head. Came from where, exactly? I take a breath. I dont know this woman, and she just threw me into a cell, so Im not exactly inclined to be forthcoming. On the other hand ... Miranda. From a ship. Seaworthy? About heres where I would normally clamp down and make her work for the information. But do I really need to protect Mal? And even if she had designs on, say, his ship, should I stand in the way? I care only about Miranda. But something about selling Mal out to this woman feels wrong. Yes, I say. Seaworthy. For now. She nods slowly. Ah. I see. So we need replacements. Heard from whom? Sorry? You said you were told that we had pumps. Oh. I nod. Lord Tess. Shes a knowledge broker. She waves a hand impatiently. I know the name. Then you know how she operates. I came to her with my problem, she suggested you. I shrug. So I came to try to barter. Danning stands up and starts to pace in front of me, her hands clasped behind her back. I notice shes wearing gloves. Strangely bulky gloves compared to her outfit. She starts to nod, once, twice, again, again. I get it. She stops and stares at me. Then, taking me by surprise, she slams a fist into my face. My head snaps to the side, and as Im still reacting, another blow takes me from that side, snapping it right back again. Two more follow. My head is screaming with pain and shock and surprise. She grabs my hair with one gloved hand and pulls my head up so that Im facing her. Now tell me why youre really here. Im still reeling from the punches. Things escalated so quickly. I told you, I say, spitting blood. The pumps. Thats it. Oh, Ben, she says, in utter disappointment. Youre going to make this hard, arent you? I try to catch her eye. I feel blood dripping from my nose and down over my already-swelling lips. Im being straight with you. All I need are pumps. Lets settle on barter and Ill be out of your way. Well leave. She smiles, but its a predatory thing. All teeth. I dont think so. Her fist flashes again, and this time I black out for a moment. When I come to, Danning is gone, but the pain remains. What have you gotten yourself into, Ben? And more importantly, how are you going to get yourself out? Theres no one else in the room with me. Its empty, save for the two chairs and some ceiling lighting, which Im guessing must be rigged to solar cells. The door to this room also has a window set in it, and Im pretty sure I see a brief flash of movement through it, proof of guards outside. But theyre not looking at me right now. I pull at the bonds around my hands. Theyre tight against the chair back, and the chair looks to be metal. No chance of breaking it, then. I push my weight back, and it rocks. Not bolted to the floor. I push down with my feet and jerk the chair backward. It slams against the floor, me still attached, and I almost cry out as the movement sends a jolt through my whole body, originating somewhere in the vicinity of my spine. The back of my skull slams against the back of the chair, and I need a moment to grit my teeth and bear out the pain. I rock the chair to the side, but it doesnt move. Too much of my weight is pushing it down. But I manage to swing my legs (which arent restrained) to one side, and with some wiggling and shifting, I manage to get the chair on its side. Its even less comfortable as my body wants to slide to the ground, but its attached to the chair, so my one arm is stretched. But now I can test my bonds again. My fall didnt seem to do anything to loosen them, but the angle has shifted. If only I could see better. Metal wont break, but it could be soldered together. That could mean weak spots, especially after decades of use. Im starting to form a plan of dragging it to the wall and doing what I can to slam the chair into it when the door opens and someone comes in. This time its not Danning. A man with dark-brown skin introduces himself as Commander Marcus. He also wears a formal uniform, but his looks more cared for than Dannings. Crisp. Clean. Likewise, his appearance. Not a touch of stubble on his face. His hair neatly trimmed. He doesnt react to my position. Lets start fresh, he says. Just you and me. I nod. Captain Danning, well, shes my commanding officer and all, and shes a great soldier and a fine captain, but she has a tendency to be a little hard, he says. Its the pressure of command, you see. Have you ever led? I shake my head. No. It seems Im the only one, too. Mal is a leader of men. Even Lord Tess. Me, Im still the loner. Its a difficult job, Marcus says. Its a lot of responsibility. His words drip sympathy. Appreciation. So you have to forgive her. I grin at him and it opens the wounds on my lip, turning the expression into a grimace. Maybe when I cant feel her fists on my face. He shakes his head. We can put a stop to all of this. Get you some bandages. All I want to know is the truth. Then Ill tell Captain Danning and it will all be okay. Just tell me why youre here. Like I told Captain Danning, I came for the pumps. Thats all. And you need these pumps because you have a ship out there? One thats operational? Yeah. Whats her name? The ship? Yes, he says as if Im an idiot. Uh ... the Phoenix. He frowns. That doesnt sound like any naval ship Ive ever heard of. I dont know. She was probably renamed. Names dont always keep in the Sick. What kind of ship? I dont fucking know, I say. Its big. It floats. It has a big back end. And yet you came from there? I lick some blood from my lips. Im what you would call a recent arrival. He nods, pacing in front of me. His face is thoughtful. Then he stops, looks down at me calmly, then kicks me in the stomach. I gasp with the fresh pain, and he continues to kick. My chest. My shoulders. My stomach. My thighs. He avoids my head. I grunt and yell as each kick adds a new star of pain to the constellation thats lighting up inside of me. Through it all, Im aware that hes being oddly restrained. Precise. As if he doesnt want to damage me too much. Makes senseI cant talk if Im dead. A broken rib or two ... fine. But no more. I repeat the truth again and again. Eventually he gets tired and moves off. I lay there and pant, and moan. And think about what Im going to do to him if I ever get the chance. And through it all, I see Miranda. Tied to the same pipes I was, waist deep in the cold, dirty water. The water rising every hour. Tick tock. Tick tock.  At some point, some others come in to put my chair back upright, and the change in position makes my body hurt in all sorts of different ways. Im just glad that Im not coughing up blood. Not yet, anyway. But even breathing hurts as my abused muscles expand and contract. All I have left right now, aside from the pain, is a white, blinding rage. I think about all the things I can do to my tormentors. I think about beating them in retaliation, but thats not really my thing. All that contact. All that blood. And I dont like inflicting pain. I dont relish violence. Except in this moment. The thoughts expand in my mind, each one more violent than the last. Guns, knives, large rocks. I think about bringing the Raven in and using her gunsone for Danning, the other for Marcus. I know, its not very productive, not useful in any way, but it helps me get through the pain and it gives me a sense of hope, strangely. Something to look forward to. Im picturing what I can do with an old spoon when the door opens again. This time they replace the bag, then take me out and drag me to another room. Im lifted and slammed onto a table or something. I feel my feet up higher than my head. My arms and legs are locked into different restraints. Then they pull the bag from my head. Now its coated with my sweat. My blood. Dannings face, upside down, above my own. Ben, Ben. Youre not being cooperative. So we have to get serious. Im going to ask you one more time why you came here. Why you really came. And then things are going to get bad. From upside down I can see that her features are all thin lines. A thin slash of a mouth. A straight, narrow nose. Thin eyebrows that arch in neat angles. Okay, I say. Fine. The truth. I came because, well, I want to join up. I smile at her and feel my scabbed-over lips crack. What do you say, will you take me? She shakes her head. No, wait, I say. It was because I heard you had the last Twinkies in all of North America. She walks away. Or was it that I thought you could help me with a fungus problem I have? Do it, is all she says. A damp cloth is placed over my face, and a hand holds it down over my nose and mouth. Then water starts washing over it. I start to drown. I try not to let the water in, but at this angle and with the cloth, its flowing right into my nose and down my airway. I try to shut it out, but I cant. I start trying to move, twisting, pulling on my arms and legs, but theyre held fast and all I can think of is that Im drowning. Im drowning. Water is in my nose, my mouth. Oh, God. Oh, God. I cant breathe. I cant breathe. Oh, God. Im going to die. This is it. Really it. Im dead. Im The water mercifully stops and its sweet relief. The cloth is removed, and I splutter and cough and through it all I taste and smell vomit. In my mouth. In my nose. That was seven seconds, Danning says, returning to view. A taste. Next time, we double that. Unless you tell me the truth. I told you the truth. My voice is a watery croak and my throat aches with the effort. Knives of pain spear through my sinuses. You said you were working for your friend with the boat. But your companions tell a different story. That you werent one of them. That you were a newcomer. That they didnt know your agenda. Fuck. So tell me what youre really doing here and Ill get you back to your cell with a meal and something warm to sleep on. At this part I really just want to tell her to fuck off. Tell her that she can eat Feral shit and choke on it. But is that only killing Miranda? Should I make something up? Try to do what I can to get out of here? What will you do to me, if I tell you what you want to know? I ask. Youre just going to let me go? It depends on what you tell me, Danning says. Ill need to know it all. But we can start with a little relief and go from there. I dont want to keep you and I dont want to kill you. She sounds sincere. So very sincere. Something about that seems reachable. Please, I say. I need to get out of here. Someone I care about ... shes in trouble. And the longer I spend here, the closer she gets to death. I came here to help her. Shes a hostage? Danning asks. Yes. And you were sent here to get something to trade for her life. Yes. What was it? I close my eyes and take a deep breath. I told you. Its the pumps. Its only ever been the pumps. She snarls and shakes her head. I thought we were finally going to be honest with each other. And yet you persist with your lies. What do you take me for, Ben? The moment, if it was ever there, is lost, and my momentary hope sticks in my throat along with the vomit. Its replaced, almost instantly, by rage. Maybe thats why I spit in her face. Its a good one, full of snot and spit and vomit. And it hits her on one cheek. Shes so shocked, she freezes for a moment. Then the panic sets in. No matter where you are in this worldout in some camp on the ground, up in an airship, or safe behind military walls, the fear of the Bug, of infected fluids, gets drilled into you. She puts a gloved hand up to her face, her eyes wide, then turns away. I smile. I cant help it. If Ive scared her at least a little bit, it was all worth it. My excitement is short-lived, as one of the men with her slams a rifle butt into my head. Then ... nothing. When I come to a few minutes later, Im back in my cell. Theyve replaced the bag and left me in a crumpled, beaten heap on the ground. My whole body is throbbing with pain, and theres still water in my nose and throat, a kind of raw, abused feeling there, but now is as good a time as any to sleep for a bit. So I do. I wake up to the door being opened again. I hear it slide, then hear it close again. Did they leave something for me? Did they end up feeding me? I get to my knees, trying to figure out how to feel around in front of me without possibly stumbling into it. Then the bag is tugged off of my head. Its dark in my cell, the only light coming in through the rectangular window that I knew was there. A figure, also in uniform (hell, they all seem to be in uniform) stands there. Almost hesitant. You come for another beating? Or is it drowning time again? My voice sounds like someone elses. Neither, comes the voice. A woman. Somethings weird, though. What would you do if you got out of here? she asks. I would go back where I came from, I say. But I need what I came for. And thats a pump? A bilge pump? Yes, I say. Several. She bends down so that were face-to-face. I cant make out much, but she seems young. Youre not going to get your pump. Never. Captain Danning wont authorize the release of any military equipment. Not to civilians. Is she even using them? All of them? It doesnt matter. She follows the code. I need those pumps. I hang my head. Shake it. How were you going to get them out? she asks. I narrow my eyes. Is this more interrogation? Youre here to be the really nice one? No, she says. I can help you. Thats what Danning said. No, you idiot. I can get your pumps. How? I ask. We have some in storage, in one of the unused machine shops. I should be able to get a few out, but it depends on how you planned to get them away. Why would you do that? I ask. Because I want to get out of here. She pauses. I need to get out of here. You want us to take you with us? Yes, she says. I consider this for a moment. I cant blame her, seeing who her friends are, but I also dont trust her. Why? She hangs her head, shakes it. I just do. Not good enough. She looks at me, and I think I see the hint of tears in her eyes. I grew up here, she says. I was born into this life. Then why would you want to leave? She starts pacing. Because Ive spent my whole life stuck within these fences. They dont let you out? She shrugs. Ive left a few times, on supply runs. But thats it. Sorry, kid, I say. Youre not convincing me. Way I see it, youre safe here, protected, with plenty of weapons to keep you set up that way. You dont understand, she says, shaking her head. Captain Danning ... she thinks that we have this charge, and its all that matters. What kind of charge? That were holding the base. And all it has. Until the government is reformed. The US government? I ask. Yes. Really. Yes. I see. Weve ... weve been here for generations. The children of officers here when everything happened. When the ... disease spread. Weve been taught to uphold the Navy way. The code. To fulfill our duty. Only you dont believe, I say. Its not that, she says. No? I, just ... the way the Captain treated you. And the others. She thinks youre after our secrets. After our... Yes? Never mind. I think about what she said. Try to imagine what it would be like to grow up in this kind of place. To be young again and want, what, freedom? My own life? It makes sense. So you want out, I say. Yes. You help us get the pumps, and we take you with us. Yes. It feels eerily familiar. I remember a man named Atticus back at Gastowns helium plant. He helped Rosie and me find our way around the plant. We originally took him captive, but he was all too willing to help. All he wanted was for us to take him out with us. I told him I would think about itI never told him I would take himand then he died. Helping us. The truth is that I need her help. I dont have many other options, and I know that the next time they come to get me, its back to the table. And the drowning. And I dont know that Ill last the next time. Maybe Ill tell them about Tamoanchan. Suddenly I have sympathy for Diego, who was tortured on Gastown and gave up its location. Okay, I say. You get us all out of here, and Ill take you with us. But you have to get us the pumps. You get that? Consider your life tied to them. I can do it, she says. The pumps at least. Getting you out of here isnt going to be easy. But you have a plan? Yes, she says. Well have to move quickly. Thats fine by me. First I need to get the pumps. How did you come here? I close my eyes. Time to start blindly trusting. Airship, I say. It dropped us off so we could approach on foot. She grabs the back of her head as if thinking. That could work. You cant approach the basewe have guns for thatbut ... if I can load the pumps into a raft, I could get them into the water. Your ship would have to pick them up from there. It could work. And it would prevent us from having to bring the Raven near the base, but ... I consider that this could be a trap. A way to get her back to our ship so that all of us could be captured. It would be a good plan, too. And yet ... shes only one person. If she frees all of us, and gets us back to the Raven, wed outnumber her easily. Unless theres something Im missing. What do you say? she asks, and I can hear the urgency in her voice. Im not supposed to be here. If someone finds me here, this whole plan is ruined. Which is exactly what a spy would say. Try to push for a decision. But I dont have many other options, and Im running out of time. If this saves me from more simulated drowning, its enough. Okay, I say. How are you going to get the pumps out? Its night, she says, and Im on patrol duty. Malcolm is supposed to be checking in, but he has a thing for me, and I think I can convince him to give me an hour or two. That still sounds risky, I say. It is. But you said you need those pumps. I nod. Ill be back for you soon, she says. Be ready. Wait, I say. Whats your name? Sarah, she says. Then she leaves me to wait. In the dark. And I start thinking about my poor choices.         SEVEN All those years ago, back at the police storage facility, I had crept back in to hear a male voice I didnt recognize. The only two men on this job were Mal and me, and I knew Mals annoying tone well enough. So I kept a tight hold on my fathers revolver and moved forward, crouched low to the ground. And heres one of the parts that Im not proud of. I thought of leaving. I had the feeling that the job was losing gas, and I thought to myself, Your airship is still outside. You could grab it and leave. I thought it. Two things kept me there. One was obviously Claudia. Our relationship was ... difficult to define. I dont know that I was in love with her. Not the way the books describe at least. It was ... something else. She was closer than a friend, not quite family. We fucked, yes, and I enjoyed it but she was, I dont know, a kindred spirit. Someone who had my back. Someone whos back I always had. I wasnt going to just abandon her. The other thing that kept me there was, frankly, the stash. The score. It was supposed to set me up for a long time, and I wasnt going to turn my back on that. But I like to believe that Claudia came first. As I moved forward, I could hear the words more clearly. Cheyenne said, You sold it to me! The male barked a laugh. So that youd do all the hard work. We figured youd set up a team, clear the area, break in, and, uh, take all the risk. He had a deep voice, with a kind of slow drawl to it. We, I noted. He said we. And you did! The man said. His voice sounded delighted. So now weve come to, uh, take whats ours. After we take care of you. You are a liar and a coward, Cheyenne said, her voice sharp. I wear all kinds of shoes, the man said. Then I heard a gunshot. It sent me moving around the corner, the gun up, trying to take in what was happening. I saw the open room. Mal stood by the table, and Cheyenne was in his arms, a large, bloody gunshot in her chest. She jerked, gasped. She wasnt coming back from that. Tess and Claudia were nearer to one of the armored vehicles. Thankfully okay. We proved to be five men, standing in the middle of the room, holding rifles and shotguns. Considering that only Mal and Claudia could shoot, they seemed to have the drop on everyone. But they didnt know I was there. I raised my pistol, bracing my shooting arm with my left arm, and I fired, aiming for the stranger nearest me. I remember he wore a puffy, black, leather jacket, and the shot hit him in the shoulder. I was lining up my next shot when the room erupted into a mess of gunfire. Two of the men turned to shoot at me, one of them the man that I hit. Mal reached for a gun and began to fire, but one of the men turned to shoot at him, with no cover, and the other two started shooting at Claudia and Tess. Shots filled the air as we all began firing. Then we all dropped into cover. I ducked back around the corner from the room. Claudia and Tess took shelter behind the vehicle. I saw Mal dive behind some weapons cases. Theres too many, I kept on thinking. I fired from my cover, keeping my eyes on the newcomers. I couldnt tell what was happening to Mal or to Claudia and Tess. I heard a cry, male from the sound of it, but I couldnt be sure. Then hell ripped open. An explosion in one corner of the room. Then another. Then smoke. We were packed into the space with explosives and weapons all around. I couldnt tell who was using them or who might have been hit. I just knew where Tess and Claudia were. I ran. Forward. I held the revolver down by my waist, close to my body, so it couldnt get easily knocked away. When I reached where the men had been, I fired. Once. Twice. Three times. I didnt know if I hit anyonefriend or enemy. By that time, my ears were ringing from the gunfire and explosions. A fire was raging in one corner of the room. Something whizzed by my head, a near miss, but I kept moving. Finally, I reached the armored vehicle, moving my way around the side with my free hand, trying to keep hold of the revolver as I coughed and choked. A hand fell on my arm, gripped tight, and yanked me. I brought up the revolver. And had to stop myself from shooting at that last moment. I caught sight of Claudias face through the smoke. She pulled me to where Tess crouched. Can you get this thing working again? I yelled. Shots were still going off. I think so, Tess said. Then do it. I turned and fired, trying to give her cover as she climbed into the drivers seat. Claudia fired as well, using a gun she no doubt took from the stash. In the swirling smoke, I saw several dark figures. Muzzle flashes, from shotguns and worse. Automatic rifle fire peppered the area, and we had to duck down. I was leaning against the Big Black Beast when it roared to life, the vibration shaking through my bones. In! I yelled to Claudia. She slid open the door and pushed inside, and I was right behind her. Drive! I yelled to Tess. Where? Were going to have to break through the door. Quickly! She pushed a few buttons, shifted a stick, and then we were moving. It took a moment for the engine to truly kick in, and then we were rushing straight at the door. Hold on! Tess said, through gritted teeth. I braced myself, trying to stay low, behind the front set of seats. We hit hard. Despite my attempts to hold myself secure, I crumpled against the front seats, and Claudia crashed into me. Tess jerked in the drivers harness. Shaking my head clear, I saw that the door had buckled but was still in place. Again! I roared. Tess shifted again, pulling the thing into reverse. Gunfire raked across the back of the vehicle, and I hoped that its armor would hold. At least anyone behind us would have to move for fear of being run over. Tess tried to give us as much room as possible to move, and we collided with something, some of the boxes or one of the tables. I fell against the back door, feeling the vibrations of the gunfire against it. I dont know how many times we can do this, Tess said. Just do it. She shifted and pushed forward, trying to gain momentum. This time I wrapped myself into a harness and Claudia did the same. I braced for impact. It was worse this time, jerking us forward, whip-like. My head felt like a stone on the end of a piece of rope. When my vision cleared, I could see that the door had come loose of the frame on one side, and daylight was peeking through. Almost there! I screamed, trying to ignore the pain in my muscles and bones. Tess didnt reverse this time. She just gunned the engine, pushing it as far as it would go. The big tires bit against the ground of the warehouse, and the door buckled further. Steam or smoke or both poured out of the front of the Beast, which I now could tell was buckled as well. Gunfire still peppered us, and in the back I could see the where the bullets had stressed the metal. More bullets, and they could pierce it. Turns out I didnt have to worry about bullets. One of the men must have gotten his hands on an explosive of some kind because the whole Beast shook as something hit it in the rear and ripped a hole in the back. Flame licked at its edges, and I could smell the fuel. Whether that little bit of impact helped, or whether Tesss persistence worked, we finally pushed through the door and into sunlight. I scrambled forward, pulling on my harness, grabbing the wheel and helping Tess to steer, remembering the layout of the cars. We hit the one right in front of us, sending it spinning away, then another on the side. Head straight for the Cherub! I slid to the back of the Beast, looking through the jagged hole there. Flames still licked at its edges, but I could see the warehouse. The men had come out through the ripped-open doors, firing at us. And there, for a moment, I saw him. Mal. He was stumbling forward, bloody and blackened. But alive. But just next to three of the men. Our eyes met there across the space. His were pleading. Mine were ... well, I couldnt see them, could I? I turned back to Tess and said, Keep moving! The meters passed, and we were halfway to the ship when another explosion ripped into the back. The Beast jumped in the air but came down again, and Tess pushed it forward. I pulled Claudia to me as the flames spread throughout the back, the structure an open, flaming mess. I was pretty sure one of our tires was flat, based on the angle of the floor. When I turned back, though, we were almost to the Cherub. In a last move of genius, Tess swerved, spinning the Beast so that its side would be between us and the warehouse, giving us better cover. Out! I yelled and we pushed out of the near side and ran for the Cherub. Behind us there was more gunfire. I moved as quickly as I could to open the ramp. Turns out I didnt need to. The ramp was open. As I stumbled up it, my head ringing, my bones aching, I saw why. A man, probably one of the same crew, writhed on the ground inside the cargo bay. Hed stepped on one of my traps, a bear trap that I had hidden under some old ballonet skin. The trap had bitten deep into his legs. I ignored him for the moment as he moaned. I needed to get us up into the air. Claudia, deal with him! And guide Tess in. Wouldnt do to have her get her leg bitten off, too. Claudia did what she did, even managing to dump the man out of the Cherub as I warmed up the engines. Then I was taking us up, pushing the engines to full before one of the strangers could fire an explosive at my baby. As we pulled away from the ground, Claudia came up to me. What about Malik? she asked. I couldnt meet her eyes. Hes probably dead, I said. Then, as if trying to convince myself. We cant go back for him. Its not worth the risk. I remember her face in that moment, concerned, sympathetic, maybe even a little disappointed. But she nodded in the end. I pulled away into the sky, pushing thoughts of Mal behind, grateful that we had escaped with our lives. The score was a bust. We had been played. We came away with nothing. But at least we were alive. At the time, that was more important than anything else, any haul, any agreement, anybody. Or at least thats what I kept telling myself. But its no wonder Mal hates me.         EIGHT I only realize Ive fallen into something resembling sleep when I start awake as the door opens. As my eyes search the darkness for a face, I hear Sarah say, Quick, get up. I do and she pulls out a knife. Turn around, she says. I hesitate for a moment, but then I realize that they could have and still could kill me anytime that they want. So I turn around, and she slips a knife into my restraints. She saws at them a bit and then they pull away. I immediately start massaging my wrists where the bindings bit into them. So far Im buying that she really wants out of this place. I stand and try to ignore the protests in my body. The wave of lightheadedness that washes through me. Lets get the fuck out of here. Sarah opens the door to make sure the hall is clear then, before I can push my way out the door, she pulls a bundle out of a backpack and tosses it at me. Whats this? Its a uniform, she says. Put it on. Why? She sighs. Because in the clothes youre wearing right now, you stand out. Put that on, and a cap, and you wont raise suspicion right away. Good idea, I say. The uniform is carefully folded. I quickly strip off my clothes and put on the uniform, handing my clothes to Sarah. She stuffs them into her backpack. The uniforms a little tight in the shoulders and loose around the waist, but it mostly fits. My boots arent exactly the same as theirs, but theyre dark enough that they should pass a quick look. I return to the hallway when Im done, fitting the cap down on my head. She grabs me by the shoulders, and for a moment I almost hit her. But I control myself when I see her face. You have to promise me, she says. No killing. I frown. Your friends have guns, I say. I dont. Im not going to promise if it comes down to them or me. Guns, yes. Ammo, no. What? She sighs again. Were low on ammunition. This place? A Navy base? I assumed youd have ammo coming out of your ears. She shakes her head. A lot of it was taken when the outbreak hit. Weve been forced to trade away some of what remained for food and other supplies. Theres a small cache left, but its rarely used. Were all trained in unarmed fighting. Just seeing the number of guns scares a lot of people away. I nod. I have to admit that I fell for it, too. Its a risky but smart gamble. Captain Danning and Commander Marcus carry loaded weapons, though. Of course, I think. Cant risk a mutiny. Shes still looking at me. Expectantly. Okay, I say. No killing. It feels like the truth, but I cant be sure. We get Whistler and Chase and then get out of here, I say. We start moving down the hallway. Wait, I say. Our weapons. They were stored in the guard station. We need to go there, too. Are you crazy? she hisses. Thats the most heavily guarded part of the base. We cant go back there. I need that revolver, I say. She meets my eyes. No. Were standing in the middle of the hallway, and any minute now someone could walk down it and spoil our plan. She doesnt seem like shes going to budge. Not now. Fine, Ill deal with it later. But Im not leaving without my fathers revolver. Okay. Lets go. Now that were out in the light, I can see what Sarah looks like. Shes young, less than twenty, I would guess. Brownish skin, short, black hair. Slight. Yet theres something in the way she stands, her posture, her movements. Evidence of some kind of training. We walk down a few corridors, take a left then a right, then another left. The hallways are empty. I bring that up to Sarah. Were spread pretty thin here. There arent as many of us as there used to be. Were all of you born here? I ask. You dont recruit from the outside? We used to, Sarah says. When I was a child. But not anymore. Captain Danning stopped trusting anyone who wasnt Navy. She was afraid that letting outsiders in would distract us from our purpose. Pretty much all of us left have Navy in our blood. I think about that. Are they really just the descendants of the base personnel? It would make sensehere they had security, safety. So they just ... stayed. And theyll just stay here, guarding the base, until what? She sighs. The captain believes that a call will come. That after all of this time, whats left of the United States government will reestablish itself and take control of the country. There have been rumors for years that theyre regaining ground back east. Then why not try to join them there? Sarah stops walking for a moment to look at me. Like my question was crazy. Because this is our charge. This base, and everything it contains. The captain sees it as a sacred duty. If this base were to fall ... she believes that can never happen. Thats why shes interrogating you. She believes youre here for other reasons. She thinks youre after our secrets. She starts walking again. I dont give a Ferals ass about your secrets, I say. They can die with them, I think. Waiting for a call that will never come. You keep saying she believes. What do you believe? Shes silent for a long moment. I dont ... Im not sure. She halts me for a second, her palm out. She looks around the next turn. I used to believe what the captain believes. And now? She looks back at me, her face a map of conflicting emotions. I think that its a big world out there. And I think I havent seen any of it. And I think if I stay here, I never will. She moves on. But you said that you left the base a few times. Supply runs? Yes, she says. When I made ensign, I was allowed to go on supply runs. Foraging? She shakes her head. Mostly just trading. We have gardens, but were always a bit low on food. She holds up a hand again at the next hallway. This time I poke my head around after she does. A guard stands there. He looks bored. Let me deal with this, she whispers. Sarah turns the corner and walks up to the guard and starts talking to him. The guard looks to her, and I see a tenseness in his posture. His voice raises, and she starts trying to talk over him. One hand reflexively goes to the butt of the gun around his shoulder. Its going bad already. Without really thinking, I round the corner and shout at the guard to attract his attention, then start running toward him. His alarm grows and he turns full on to face me, and I hope that Sarah was right about him not having ammunition. Then she grabs him from behind. One arm goes against his neck, and the other arm grabs the first. The guards own hands rise to try to grab Sarahs arm, but she holds firm, even when her feet come up off the ground as the taller guard bucks. Just as Im reaching them both, the guard goes down, Sarah dropping to the ground with him, keeping her grip secure. I stare down at her. That was great, I say. I told you I would deal with this. It didnt look like it was going well. Her face screws up. Hurry up and open the door. The guards keys are clipped to his belt, so I grab them and open the door. Chase is inside, a bag over her head. I pull it off, then pull her out of the cell. Sarah is already pushing the guard in in her place. Hes starting to stir, so I bunch up the dark cloth bag and stuff as much of it as I can into his mouth. His eyes flicker open and look at me in alarm, but then Im pushing him down and shutting the door, locking it with the keys. Sarah is already freeing Chases hands with a long-bladed knife. What the fuck is going on? Chase hisses at me. Were getting out of here, I say. What about the pumps? Ive handled the pumps, Sarah says. In return for you taking me with you. Chase opens her mouth, and I can tell shes going to ask more questions, so I cut her off. No time. We have to get Whistler out and then we have to get back to the Raven. Chase frowns. Ill get you out, Sarah insists, but you cant kill anyone. Try it and Ill stop helping you. Got it? I ask Chase. Okay. She says. Sarah passes her a uniform, too, and she puts it on, tucking her hair underneath the cap. Whistler? I ask Sarah. She nods and leads us down more corridors. I tell Chase to get behind us. Even with the uniform, her unique haircut is more likely to give us away. And none of us have any viable weapons. Sarah slows and turns back to us. Whistlers being held around the next corner. She pokes her head around. There isnt anyone guarding the cell. Ill stand outside with Chase. You go inside and get Whistler. She hands me the knife. I nod. Im still holding the keys from the guard Sarah took down. She and Chase take up position while I open the door. When it swings open, I have a shock. Commander Marcus is standing in front of me.  The Commander turns to me in surprise and I slam my fist, still holding the keys, into his face. Then I drop the keys, grab his head, and slam it into the wall. I punch him in the side, then kick his leg. He crumples to the ground. Hes down on the ground, and a hot rage fills me. I start kicking him, delighting in the impact of my boots on his body. How do you like it? I ask. This feel good? I stare at his face even as it contorts in pain. Its too groomed. Too perfect. Too clean. I think about him carefully shaving himself. Cleaning himself. Safe here behind walls, with big guns to keep others away. Its false. The world is dirty and rough and chaotic. He offends me. His cleanliness offends me. He needs to be dirtied up. Roughed up. Bloodied. The moment the thought hits me, I realize what Im doing and fall back, panting. I was ready to kill this man. I hear Mirandas voice in my mind saying, simply, Ben. And most of the rage and anger falls away. Its not important. None of this is really important. I feel the cold of the oily water as it soaked into my skin. Imagine Miranda there. I shake my head. When I look down at Marcus, hes not moving. Unconscious, then. I turn to see Whistler looking at me with a strange, intense expression of enjoyment. It sends a shiver down my back. Now do I get a turn? No, I say. We need to get out of here. I move around and cut through the restraints. One of their people is getting us out of here in return for a ride out with us. I never agreed to taking anyone else with us, Whistler says. I clench my jaw. Shes getting us out of here, so were taking her. Shes also getting us the pumps. If you want to return to Mal without them, then its on you. Whistler glares at me, and I can see the thoughts warring inside that thick head. Fine. Well take her. I notice another bag on the ground, discarded, and I pick it up and wad it into the commanders mouth like I did with the other guard. It should help buy us a little time. Then I catch sight of whats strapped to the commanders leg. A very familiar revolver. In Mals leg holster. I reach down and remove the holster. Its my fathers revolver all right. Makes sense. Marcus was the one who pulled it off of me. If ammo is as tight as Sarah said, I can see him holding onto this. I leave the commander on the floor and exit with Whistler. This is Sarah, I say. Sarah, your commander was in there. You didnt hurt him, did you? she asks. I scratch my head. Just a little bit. He put up a struggle, I lie. Hell live. She moves to the door, looks into the window. What she sees apparently satisfies her. I didnt want anyone hurt. Hell pull through, Whistler says. Lets worry more about us instead. Agreed, Chase says. Fine, Sarah says. Lets go. I can take us out a different way. I know where the patrols go. We can get into a car and avoid them. What about our weapons? Chase asks. They took Sully off of me. Sarah looks at me, pleading. The weapons are probably still near the gate. If we go that way, theyll definitely be alerted. But I can sneak you out the back way. Down to the water. Then we can circle around to wherever your ship is. Sounds good to me, I think. I already have my revolver. I realize that makes me a hypocrite, but fuck itWhistler and Chase arent exactly my friends. Take us out the back way, I say to Sarah.  The thing about the base is that its actually pretty large. Fenced in, yes, but the living quarters, according to Sarah, arent that close to the water and the officers use a series of cars to get around inside the grounds. Its into one of these that Sarah ushers us. Ill keep the lights off, she says. I should be able to navigate well enough in the dark. Ive been doing it most of my life. Are there other cars out here? I ask. Yes, she says. But Im hoping well be able to avoid them. The car is an open-topped vehicle, with four seats and a simple windshield. The hope is that right now we look like four uniformed, completely-belonging-in-this-base individuals. And with the lights off, hopefully we wont call attention to ourselves. What about the pumps? Whistler hisses. I put them in a raft, dropped them into the sound, Sarah says. The what? Whistler asks. The water, Sarah says. The current should take them north. I put a tracker in with them. We should be able to find them once we get into the water. Or the air, I say. Im starting to get desperate to be back in the air. Im sick of water. Being on it. Having it forced into my body. All of it. The car hits a bump and we all go lurching. Watch where youre going, Whistler grunts. I cant see very well! Sarah says. Im doing the best that I can. Leave her alone, I say to Whistler. I realize that Ive started thinking that Sarah is on my side, and Whistler and Chase arent, but that isnt exactly true. I dont know that I can trust Sarah or that I cant trust Whistler and Chase. I just want to get back to the Phoenix. Weve been driving for a little while when we see the flash of lights nearby. Shit, Sarah says. I watch as the lights swivel toward us and another car, one very like ours, starts moving toward us. Theyre coming after us, I say. I know! Sarah says. She guns the engine and we shoot ahead, which throws me back against my seat. But when I regain my position I see the other car matching speed with us. I think I see two people inside the vehicle. Try to keep her steady, I say. I draw the revolver and fire behind us, trying to hit one of the two dark figures I think I see inside the car. There has to be someone driving it, I think. At the very least. No! Whistler screams into my ear. Shoot for the lights! So I do. Or at least I try to. Sarah is swerving the vehicle around, and I cant seem to get a steady bead on anything. The first shot seems to go off into darkness. The second follows it. The third shot hits the vehicle, but I dont see it do anything. And now Im down to a handful of shots left. Im just lining up a fourth shot when we hit something. Hard. For a moment, I feel the impact, and then were spinning through the air and Im tossed from the car onto the hard ground. The trauma of the last few days has weakened me and its all I can do to maintain consciousness as I roll against the ground, trying to suck in air, feeling the abrasions on my skin as I slam into the ground. Amazingly, my revolver is nearby, just out of my reach, or at least I assume so judging by the three identical images that are spinning through my vision. As those three images resolve into one, I see a soldier, a man in a Navy uniform, moving toward us, a rifle in his hand. He fires and I see the muzzle flash, hear the retort of the gun even through my ringing ears. I dont have time to think much, no time to analyze or plan. I scramble for the revolver, scoop it up into my grip, and sight on the soldier. His shots are tearing up the ground around us, and I squeeze the trigger. Once, then twice. I dont know what hits and what doesnt, but I see him jerk back and fall to the ground. Then, energized by my little victory, I scramble to my feet and move forward to the other soldier, revolver out. I move toward the vehicle, but ... theres no one else there. Just the one. Sarah comes running up beside me, grabs onto my arm and pulls it down. I told you not to hurt anyone! Her voice is on the edge of hysterics. I turn to look at her, suddenly cold. He was going to kill one of us. You. Me. Whistler or Chase. I had no choice. She runs to the body, bending down over it, but I grab her and pull her off and toward the other car. Ours is tipped on its side, and I dont know if it works or not. Get in, I say, pushing her toward it. She turns to me, defiant, with tear-filled eyes. Get in, I repeat. There are going to be others coming soon. With more guns. And they will be shooting to kill. I didnt want it to happen like this, she says, in almost a sob. It is happening like this, I say. And we have to get out of here. Sarah stands there for a moment, her shoulders heaving. If you dont leave with usnowthey will get you. The best I think you can hope for is a life in a cell. She looks up at me and suddenly seems to come to. She knows better than anyone else what kind of punishment she might face. And I can see it dawning on her. Get into the car. We need to get to the water. She nods, dumbly, and gets into the car. Whistler gives me a quick nod and gets in as well, followed by Chase. I run back to the fallen soldier, pick up his rifle. Hes moaning and writhing on the ground. I have no idea if hell make it. I guess it depends on whether other people find him or not. I consider putting a bullet in himit might be the merciful thing to dobut the truth is, more than the promise I made to Sarah, I dont want to waste the ammo. So I crawl into the car and tell Sarah to go. We ride off into the night.  We reach the water without incident. With a little coaxing, Sarah gets the raft and together we lower it into the water. She seems in shock, and while a small part of me sympathizes, I find the larger part of me has no patience for it. She made her decisiondecided to turn on her crazy cult family, and this is what happened. After their torture, and trying to kill me, and all of us, I just have no patience left. So we all jump into the raft and pull out into the sound. Will they come after us? I ask Sarah. Shes huddled up in one corner of the raft, knees up near her head, her hands over her face. She doesnt answer me at first. Sarah, I say, firmly. She looks up at me. It all went wrong, she says. Will they come after us? I ask again. She shakes her head. No. Not right away. It will take them a little while to figure out what happened and where we went. Like I said ... were spread thin. By the time they can organize, we should be picked up. Which brings me to my next question, I say, looking to Whistler and Chase. How are we going to get the Raven to come to us? Nobody answers, but Sarah reaches into a pocket of her uniform and pulls out a flare gun. Whistler takes it. Its a good idea. Normally I would be worried about someone else seeing it, but if Sarah is right, were ahead of them. If we can get close enough to the Raven to signal to them, we should be okay. All I can think of, though, is Miranda. As I sit in the back of the boat, salty spray peppering my face, I just see her in my mind. Its because of me that her life is in danger, because of my actions that shes at Mals mercy. I have to save her, I think. Have to get her out of there, bring her back to Tamoanchan. Fix things. As Whistler fires the flare into the sky, I think that theres more than just one sinking ship to save.         NINE As the Raven approaches the Phoenix, I notice the other airships flying in formation above it. I count five in total, a mix of designs from cargo ships to small passenger dirigibles. But what draws my eye is a long, flat airship, its envelope a matte grey-blue that almost seems to blend into the sky. Ive never seen a ship like it before. Whats that? I ask. Chang looks up at me, then where Im pointing. He smiles. Thats Maliks ship. The Argus. Figures, I think. Mal would have a unique ship like that. I wonder where he got it. Hes been very busy since I saw him last. Whistler verifies our identity over the radio and then lowers us to the Phoenix. Looking down on it from the Raven, I almost think I can see it riding low in the water. We descend and the ladder is lowered and I push my way to it. Whistler gives me a look, but I give Whistler a look right back that says dont fucking get in my way. The ladder barely hits the deck before Im down it. Mal is there with several of his people. Armed. I spare a look for Mal. I got your pumps, I say. Whistler will tell you all about it. Then I push through them, heading for the stairwell. I hear Mal behind me saying, Let him go. I tear down into the bowels of the ship, calling after Miranda. I vaguely remember my trip from the lower levels up to the deck, so I try to retrace it, heading down, running up and down corridors, calling her name all the time. I run from one stairwell to another, descending deeper into the ship. There are lights down here, but theyre dim, emergency lighting of some sort. I go down, ever down, until I hit water. Until I find where the ocean is encroaching. Miranda! I yell. Miranda! I splash through the water, hoping to hear her answering voice. But I cant hear it. I pause, realizing that my legs are kicking up water, that the sound might be blocking her. Nothing but the creaking of the ship. Somewhere I dont want to look, a voice that I dont want to hear starts whispering to me. What if she? No. Miranda! I keep on like that, calling, searching, quietly despairing, until a voice stills me. Benjamin, Benjamin, Benjamin. I turn and see Mal, perched on the edge of the stairs, looking at me. Where is she? I ask. He smiles. A wide, self-satisfied smile. The dim lighting makes him look demonic. She is safe. The smile grows even wider, something I didnt think possible. Shes aboard my airship. What? Come now, Benjamin. Do you really think that little of me? That I would toss away the life of an innocent? But you said I said exactly what I needed to do to cause you pain. To make you work for me. To get you to dance. You care for Miranda, that much is obvious. Why wouldnt I use that? You bastard. Clearly, Benjamin, you still have a lot to learn. So much. You use whatever tools are at your disposal ... without compromising your own integrity. Your morals. I know, I know. You think me a beast. A villain. He shrugs. Perhaps I am. Perhaps I have been. But Im not the only one. I feel my shoulders slump. Hes defeated me. I got you your pumps, I say. He nods, crosses his arms in front of his chest. So I was told. As well as another guest. That was the cost of getting the pumps out. Mal nods. So Whistler said. He waves a hand through the air. Its a small matter, he says. Assuming your pumps work. They should, I say. Well see. So what happens now? My people will replace the pumps. Perhaps our newcomer will help us. If they work as promised, things will return to normal. We will continue to Hawaii as planned. And Miranda and me? I ask. I will fulfill my part of the promise, he says. You will come with us to Hawaii. And then? He shrugs. I havent yet decided. And if the pumps dont work? I ask, dreading the answer. He smiles wickedly. If not, Benjamin, I will enjoy seeing you suffer. Now. He examines his gloves. Have you ever heard of keelhauling? No. Its an old nautical punishment. I found it in a book. The ... criminal is tied to a rope and pulled across the ships keel. The bottommost part. I think that will be a fitting end. And what happens to Sarah? That I dont know. Maybe shell stay with us. Maybe shell go. It all depends. I meet his eyes. The pumps will work. He holds his hands out, palms up. Then we all will prosper. I want to see Miranda. He smiles again. I want to have a working, non-sinking ship. Then he turns and climbs the steps, slamming the heavy metal door behind him.  Mal locks me in with the people working on the pumps. My fate was tied up with the pumps, he said. Might as well be there in the thick of it. Two of Mals men, accompanied by Sarah, are now splashing through the flooded Phoenix. How is it going? I ask Sarah. She frowns up at me in the dim light. Were not allowed to use open flame down heretoo much engine oil and other substancesbut Mals people have a solar-charged light that theyre using as they replace the pumps. Ben, let me work, she says before turning back to the task at hand. Shes been chilly to me since we left the base. She thinks I broke the rules by shooting that soldier. I would feel guilty except I know that it was either him or one of us. Besides, he might have lived. If he got attention in time. The truth is, I dont care either way. Sarah and the two men are working to release one of the broken pumps, crowded in around it. I get the feeling that the water is interfering with their efforts. My problem is that theres not much for me to do. I cant fix the pumps. I cant really help them with fixing the pumps. All I can do is think about the rising water. And Miranda. Wherever the fuck she is. Hold this, Sarah says, splashing over to me. She passes me a large wrench. She wipes a hand across her head, smearing it with greasy water. Whats between you and this Mal? Its a long story, I say. Okay, she says, holding up her hands. Dont tell me, then. I need to concentrate. Sarah returns to the pumps, and I watch her and Mals men work. The sad part about all of this is that a part of me appreciates what it is that Mal is doing. Leading his people away. Trying to give them a home, some security. Ive never been much of a joiner, I only started working with the boffins in the last year, but in another place, another time, I might do something similar in his place. But to give up the air... Whats really bothering me is that even if they get these pumps working, its back to my cell for me. Miranda will be safe, which is good, but Ill be a prisoner until we reach Hawaii. I took my shot already, and Mal easily disarmed me. Its unlikely that Ill get another chance. So where does that leave me? Is this what I have to look forward to? Another week or so belowdecks before the end? God, I miss the sky. I miss the Cherub. I miss Miranda. We need to get back to Tamoanchan, to make sure everyone is okay. And if they are? Ive been thinking about it, in bits and pieces. Returning to the Frothy Brew for a beer. Visiting Rabbi Cohen. Seeing Sergei. I even had this vague, unformed idea of maybe getting my way back onto a ship. Running forage for the island. Making myself useful. And staying near Miranda. Things always go wrong when I leave Miranda. I shiver as the freezing water soaks into my bones. Its hard to tell how quickly the water is rising because it always seems to be around my thighs. Any luck? I call out. In the last few minutes? Sarah says. Fuck. I try to think about what Miranda would do in this situation. She rarely ever freaks out. She has a methodical mind. I used to think it frustrated me, but here in the dark I realize that I admire it. I admire her. Her mind is a thing of beauty. Maybe I should try to emulate it more. So ... whats next? This isnt the end. If the pumps are restored, I wont get keelhauled. Which would be very good. Then Mal puts me back into my cell, but only until we reach Hawaii. Then hes going to have to get me off the ship. Whatever punishment he sees fit to deliver will work best in front of an audience. Thats how Mal works. There will be opportunities. I just need to see Miranda. Then together we can try to make an escape. But back to Tamoanchan, Ben? My natural cynicism jumps all over this, but I try to channel Mirandas optimism. Why not? Maybe I can steal an airship. Take us back up into the sky and away from Mal and his people. I got my ship back from the middle of an armed helium plant, didnt I? And that was without Miranda. Of course all of this depends on me not being keelhauled. So I really hope that Sarah knows what shes doing. Any progress? I call out. She doesnt answer this time. Just throws back her arm, flips up her hand and extends her middle finger. Its an old gesture but one that hasnt lost its meaning. Cute. How else to get back to Tamoanchan? Im no sailor, but maybe we could steal a raft or boat. Surely wed have to wash ashore at some point. Maybe we could get passage aboard a passing ship. Have them put me down somewhere like where I met up with Diego. Somewhere on a route where he might find me. But thats a long shot, especially since Diego is a beaten and bloody mess at the moment. No easy answers. What Im good at is flying. Surviving. Killing Ferals. Being a bastard. You know, the usual. I wonder if maybe I could track down Claudia. My oldest friend, former lover, comrade-in-arms, and the most dangerous woman Ive ever met. Last I saw her, she was still on Gastown. I hope she didnt get herself caught in all the chaos that was happening. If I could get in touch with Claudia, then she could take us to Tamoanchan. But ... I dont know how I would do that. And for some reason the thought of having Claudia and Miranda on the same ship makes me uncomfortable. Things were much easier before I went and started having feelings. Then I think about Lord Tess. Maybe she would know a way to get back to the island. She certainly knew about Tamoanchan. Maybe she could put us in touch with someone who could take us there. I have to return anyway to pay her back. The more I think about it, that looks like the best option. She came through with the pumps. And if were lucky, Mals people will drop us right there. All this assuming, of course, that the island is still there. That other raiders didnt strike it. That it hasnt been destroyed or evacuated or I hear a wet coughing sound followed by a whoop of success from Sarah and the two men. You got it working? I ask. The first one, she says. Even in the dim light I see her smiling. But it works. The others should be easy. I feel a weight lift from me. The pumps look like theyre going to work. Sarah splashes over to me, a worried look on her face. What is it? I ask. She says in a whisper, I know these pumps. Ive worked on all kinds of pumps like these. Some of our working artillery is on the Fincher. Its in the water. We have to keep the pumps operating, otherwise she goes down. I think youve proved your skills, I say. She nods, then looks back at the men quickly. From what I can see, these pumps didnt just break down. She pauses for a moment, her face serious. I think someone deliberately damaged them. I narrow my eyes, lowering my voice to match hers. Are you sure? Id report it to my commanding officer. Hmmm. Mals little coterie might not be as cozy as they seem to be. The question I ask myself is, do I tell him? At one point, I would have without question. Now ... ? I wonder if its something I can use to get out of this mess. An information exchange of my own. Ill figure it out later, I think. See what that knowledge might be worth. Sarah asks for the wrench, and Im about to pass it to her when I hear the door to the room start to open. I think they must have been hovering outside the door to have come so quickly after the first pump was replaced. I step back as it opens. And a body falls through it.         TEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Ben is back. Not that Malik told me, of course, but I was able to pick it upfrom some of his people, from overhearing them talk. They have him trying to get the pumps working againbut apparently hes not alone. Which seems strange. My instincts tell me that if he brought someone back, its because its help that we needor at least that he believes that. Ben isnt overly trusting, though, so if he believes, theres a good chance that it will work. I hope. I dont know that I trust that much in Ben these days. He did return, thats true, but then I was never in that much danger after all. What matters most is the future. Everything right now hinges on the pumps working. If they dont, then the ship goes down and Malik will take his revenge on Ben and theres nothing Ill be able to do about it. If the pumps do work, Ben goes back into his cell. Until we reach Hawaii. Then ... I dont think I can protect Ben any longer. Everything Ive seen says that Malik wont be able to let this go. Let Ben go. Hes held on to this hate for too long. He needs some outlet for it. And he needs spectacle. Malik once came in to see me for a cut on his arm, near the shoulder, something that he sustained while making repairs. He took his shirt off so that I could examine it. He had scars all over his torsocruel-looking scars that were probably the result of torture. He didnt explain, but I got the feeling that they were the result of Ben leaving him behind. Those marks might as well be the language of his hate, etched into his skin, never to go away. So, yeah ... hes going to want his revenge. I do believe that Malik will let me go, though. He still likes me, and he has no cause to punish me. So even if he keeps Ben, I would be fine. There are some people I know, who would tell me to let that happen. That no matter what happened to Ben, I should get out, get free. They would say that the data in my pocket is worth more than any one man. That it could save hundreds, maybe thousands. Only ... I could never do that, of course. I couldnt leave, knowing Ben was headed for death. I couldnt let one man die, especially Ben, even if it would save more. So I have to figure out a way to get off of this boat, to get both of us off of this boat, and then we both need to get back to Tamoanchan as quickly as we possibly can. Tamoanchan... Im deathly afraid that something happened to the island. I find myself thinking often lately of Clay and Sergei. I left them all alone to go off with Ben to Gastown. And now I wonder, why? Ben needed help, I know, but I abandoned my people to do so. Went with him to chase after the Cherub. In the end it got me the data from Gastown, but my thoughts keep returning to Sergei and Clay. I hope that the people of Tamoanchan have been good to them, and have kept them fed and supplied. I hope that nothing went wrong with Alpha, our resident Feral test subject. When Ben convinced the Council to set them up on a nearby island, isolated, alone, I was so angry with him. But as Ive had time to think about it, its the only realistic way we could have received permission to study a live Feral in an inhabited outpost. Were smart people, we have protocols, but maybe Ive caught some of Bens fear of Ferals. Even the best-designed system can sometimes fail. But its not just Clay and Sergei who I think of. I think of all the others back at Apple Pi, all those who died or went missing after the raiders attacked. It took years to assemble that group of expertssome of the finest minds in biology and medicine and virology. We were never sure what happened to most of them when our lab at Apple Pi was sacked. Some of them died, of course. Im not naive enough to think otherwise. But Ben, who was there, assured me that some of them escaped. How many or who? I dont know. We didnt have time to even look for them, to try to trace anyone who might have been there. As soon as we found Ben, it was on to Tamoanchan, then Gastown, and then Ben and I were falling into the water, watching his airship explode above us. Theres been no time to breathe. Until now, I suppose. Ive also been thinking about the kiss. I guess it was natural for Ben to kiss me just before we jumped to what could have easily been our deaths. I think that might have been the only type of circumstance that would make him throw caution out the window like that, but ... Id like to think it was more than that. I could feel it; so could he. There was much more beneath it. I once read about fungiabout how you might see just some small sign of them above ground, but that they could extend for miles, perhaps, underground. Thats how I think of how Ben and I feel about each other. It wasnt always obvious, not the least to ourselves, but there was a lot more living and breathing and, yes, lurking under the surface. Yes, I guess I am calling my feelings for Ben fungal in nature. They do seem complex and occasionally grow in interesting directions. Things are muddied, of course, by Claudia, by all accounts Bens former lover, recently returned to his life. I know that Ben has feelings for me, but does he also have feelings for her? I dont think of myself as a possessive person, but Im also not interested in competing with someone else. Its something we should probably talk about, but ... first things first. First we have to get off of this ship. Then we can figure this all out. First we have to escape.  It was during dinner with Malik, our usual meeting, that I made my decision. As Malik opened another bottle of wine, I thought to myself, I cant trust this man. It had nothing to do with the wine. Just his motivations. He would always hate Benthat much was clearand the pumps Ben brought back wouldnt ultimately make a dent in that hate. We atefresh fish as usualand drank. As the wine in the bottle dwindled, I encouraged Malik to pull out something stronger. Cmon, I said. We should celebrate. You have your pumps. Your ship isnt going to sink. Well see, he said. But the truth is that I am optimistic about our chances. He took a long swallow. You didnt think I would let you go down with the ship, did you? I wasnt sure, to be honest, I said. I shrugged. Maybe. I dont really understand you. Yet. Please, he said. You must believe me. I do hate Benjamin, but you ... well, I have no problems with you. Prove it, I said. How? Open a bottle of something so that we can celebrate. So he did. Whiskey. Or rather not just whiskey, as he said, single-malt scotch, a beverage far superior, in his opinion. The one he opened he swore tasted like the sea, and though I was skeptical, it was very evocative. One drink turned into two, then more. All the while, I became more charming and more flirtatious. All the while he loosened up and had more. The thing that I know that he didnt is that I can pretty much outdrink anyone. I havent met a person who can beat me. So I matched him as much as I dared, pouring more for him in the first place. Benjamin doesnt deserve you, Malik slurred. You should stay with me. Be our doctor. Live with us on Hawaii. Thats a tempting offer, I said. Can you sweeten the deal? And so he didoffering me a position of authority, guaranteeing me my own lab and whatever equipment they could find for me, pledging me people to help and offer support. To his credit, he was fairly realistic, but I believe that he was serious. I just couldnt tell if he really wanted me or if he just wanted to hurt Ben, or maybe both at the same time. I told him Id do it. It excited him, of course, and so I insisted we toast to it and, when I could tell that he was good and drunk, I moved closer, placing my hand on his arm. He looked into my eyes, his all glassy. Then with my free hand, I took the syringe I had stolen from the infirmary and I pressed it into his skin. It was only a mild sedativeit was all I could make off withbut with the alcohol in his system, it did the trick. He looked up at me in surprise, his reactions slow, and then he leaned forward, resting his head against the table. Thankfully, Malik always insisted on us having privacy during our meals. I made sure his heartbeat was stable, then I snuck out to go find Ben. It was time to get off of the boat.         ELEVEN For a moment, everyone freezes. Then everyone starts to move at once. I only have the wrench (they stripped me of my revolver on our flight back) and so I hold it up, ready to swing. Im vaguely aware of the men moving behind me, drawing weapons or maybe tools like me. Then, Ben? Its Miranda and I dont know what the hell to think. The funny thing is I almost smell her before I hear her voice. Its not that weird. Weve spent a lot of time together, in the field and cooped up in airships. Ive been around her when shes clean, when shes filthy, when shes stressed or scared or excited. Smell can be a valuable sense to develop as a forager. Your nose can alert you to the nearness of a Feral nest, or let you tell their droppings from those of an animal, or another human. It can tell you if food is good or if youre engines bad. It can warn you of disease. Not the Bug, mind you, but the other kinds. Im sure my nose has saved my life a few times. So its no surprise that I smell Miranda and I relax a bit, no longer tense and waiting to fight. Sarah, however, does not. Neither do Mals men. One rushes forward, his dark cap soggy and misshapen, a similar wrench in his hands. The other one, bearded and bareheaded, has a pistol in his hand. Without thinking, I go for the bearded man. The water slows me and I slip forward, but I manage a glancing blow on his arm that sends him to the side. But it opens me to the other man, who swings his wrench at me. I manage to duck, aided by the fact that Ive pretty much fallen, and the wrench clangs against some metal piping. Sarah is just standing there. Sarah, help! I say. She still doesnt move. I manage to get my legs under me and push off the floor, throwing myself into wrench-man, pulling him down into the reeking water. I get him in a hold, similar to the one Sarah used back at the base, but above me I can see the man aiming his pistol, waiting for a shot at me. The man Im holding goes slack, but his friend is just about ready to fire when Miranda comes splashing through the water. The man swivels the pistol to her, but she collides into him and something in her hand flashes toward him. A moment later hes crumpling into the water. She turns to me, and I realize that shes holding a syringe in her hand. She stabs it into the man Im holding, depressing the plunger, and I release him a moment later, making sure to keep his head out of the water. What the hell is going on? I ask. As I rise, I turn to Sarah. And where the hell were you? She crosses her arms in front of her chest. I dont know who this is, she says, indicating Miranda. And I dont know whats happening here. Im certainly not going to risk angering someone who might be in charge of what happens to me. Ben, who is this? Miranda asks. Miranda, this is Sarah. She helped us get the pumps that Mal needed. Miranda nods. Miranda, what are you doing here? I ask. Im getting you out of here, she says. Now. She turns and moves back to the door. I start moving toward the door, then grab Mirandas hand. We should take her with us, I say, indicating Sarah. Miranda looks at me questioningly. She helped us out. Got us out of a serious bind. I dont know that I feel comfortable leaving her behind here with Mal. Does she want to go? Miranda asks. Then to Sarah, Do you? Sarah eyes Miranda skeptically. Are you sure you can get off of this ship? she asks. Yes, Miranda says. No hesitation. No doubt in her voice. And Ill be free to go my own way? When I want to? Of course, I say. Sarah looks first at me, then at Miranda and back again. We dont have much time, Miranda hisses. We have to move now. Mal doesnt know you, I say to Sarah. I cant guarantee hell give you a fair shake. Come with us. Sarah looks like shes going to say something, but then she just nods. Okay. Lets go. As we move through the door and up into the ship, I ask Miranda, Where exactly are we going? Up, she says. Now keep quiet. I follow closely behind her as she navigates the stairs and corridors of the ship. My feet and legs are still wet, but it feels good not to have water splashing around my knees. I must smell awful, though. Mirandas difficult to keep up with. She seems on a mission. You must have some plan to get us off of this ship. She smiles and opens the door to the deck of the Phoenix. Follow me, she says.  Be careful, Miranda says as she creeps onto the deck. A lot of Maliks people moved back to the airships because of the sinking, but there still might be guards around. Or Mal, I say. She giggles, which seems completely out of place. I dont know if Ive ever heard Miranda giggle. No, she says. He wont be coming. I frown. What happened? Ill tell you later. First, Im going to dazzle you. Have you been drinking, Miranda? Shush. She leads us across the deck. Its dark outside, night. I can smell the water, hear the waves lap at the side of the ship. Also the creaking of the deck. I can almost imagine that were on some abandoned hulk floating in the ocean. Almost. Here, Miranda says. She grabs me and pulls me forward. Ahead, lines secure an airship to the Phoenixs deck. A ladder hangs down from it, and Miranda pulls it toward us. I look up, trying to see the airship there, but its difficult to make out. Of course, its dark and the moon is largely hidden by clouds. Climb, Miranda says. Where are we going? I ask. Mirandas drawing breath when the drone of an airship engine hits my ears, growing steadily louder, and lights start illuminating the opposite end of the ship. Another airship coming home to drop off its passengers. Climb! Miranda says, half whisper, half hiss. I climb. Moving as quickly as I can. My limbs are still recovering from their immersion in the cold water, but adrenaline kicks in, propelling me upward. I feel the settling of the ladder after Im up a ways, the feeling of someone else climbing beneath meSarah or Miranda. Above me is a strange airship. How Miranda got to it, I dont know. Maybe she just got lucky. But is there anyone on board? Surely she would have told me. Even as I get closer, I cant make out much about it. There arent lights on it, which makes a kind of sense. Lights might make it a target for enemy ships. Even with the Phoenixs artillery, it wouldnt make sense to call attention it. And yet, as I climb up to an unknown ship, possibly crewed by hostile people, all I can think is God, how Ive missed being in the sky. When I get to the top, I can see that the ladder leads into a hatch inside the gondola. Its also dark, but I can feel my way around the edge and tell that its secure for me to climb up into. So I do that and scoot myself inward and then pull up Sarah (I can tell by her breathing and the way she smellsoily and wet like me) up alongside me. Then Miranda is up. She scoots around to one side and I hear something click, and then the ladder starts to retract up into the ship. Only when its completely retracted does she press something else, closing the hatch beneath us. One final switch or lever brings the lights up inside the ship. Welcome to the Argus, Miranda says. Mals ship? I ask, remembering what Chang had said. She nods. Is he here? Miranda shakes her head. Hes still down on the Phoenix. I hold up my hands. None of this makes sense. Youre going to have to explain all of this. Fine, she says. As much as you want. But we have to get out of here first. Before they figure it out. I look to Sarah. You know anything about airships? Not a thing, she says. Ive just ridden on them. Okay, then. You find a place to stash yourself. Stay out of my way, okay? She nods moves off deeper into the ship. Ill be right back, Miranda says. Going to detach the anchor. You know your way around this ship? I ask. Better than you, she says, before disappearing through a door at the back of the gondola, leaving me alone. The Arguss gondola is mostly dominated by a central bank of consoles with a series of intact black screens in a grid pattern at its center. Three seats surround the central area. Im figuring out which seat I need to sit in to fly this thing when my back explodes in pain, right in the area of my right kidney. I feel a hand on the back of my head and it slams my face down toward the console in front of me. I manage to brace my hands against the console, so instead my face and nose smack hard into my knuckles and I see white for a moment. Pushing down with my left hand, I swivel right, aiming my elbow back. It connects with something, but a knee takes me in the belly and a fist glances off my jaw. I push back with both arms to get some breathing room and see that my attacker is a pale man, thin and blond, wearing some kind of blue, one-piece uniform from the Clean. He doesnt give me much time to look, though, because he comes back at me with fists swinging. I hold up my arms to protect my face and catch a fist on the forearm, then one on my shoulder. This has to stop. I arc forward, leading with my head, but he drops back, which is okay because I keep going, thrusting forward with both of my fists, colliding with him and slamming him up against the wall of the gondola. I pummel him in the midsection, getting a good blow into his solar plexus, which makes him choke. Then I grab him and smack him back against the wall again. The back of his head hits hard. Then I hear Mirandas voiceBen! I spare a moment to look and see her toss me something small and black. I catch it just after realizing that its my fathers revolver. By the time my attacker is recovering, I have the revolver pressed against his chest. Stop, I say. He freezes, his hands flapping at his sides like flags. Dont shoot. Dont move and I wont have to. What are you going to do with him? Miranda asks. Sarah! I call. She appears a moment later. See if the cargo area has any life jackets. She raises her eyebrows but goes to check. She returns a few minutes later and nods. Good, I say. You and Miranda are going to take our friend here back with you and fit him with one. Then, when I take us out from over this boat, youre going to push him out of the ship. The mans eyes widen. Dont worry, I say. You should survive. Miranda looks at me questioningly. Ill take the ship lower, I say. Miranda, take the revolver, I say. Sarah is better with oneshes had more training, but the thing is I dont trust her. Miranda takes the revolver, keeping it level on Mals man. Cmon, she says, waving him toward the back of the gondola. I wipe the blood from my nose and turn back to the series of seats, wincing at the pain where the man hit me. Miranda points to one corner of the console with her free hand. Flight controls are over there. Thats just what I thought, I said, settling into the seat. The setup looks fairly simple to operate. Simple steering yoke, throttle controls, rudders, and so on. I look out of the windows of the gondola and cant make out much outside of the moonlight. Have to worry about the lights later. Its my first time at the controls of a ship since the Cherub exploded over both of our heads. Hello, I say to the ship. Lets be friends. Then I fire her up and grab hold of the yoke. Easy now, Ben, I tell myself. I want to tear away from the ship, at whatever top speed this ship is capable of, but its best to ease out. Not draw undue attention to ourselves. I remember the five other ships I saw on entry with the Raven. Six ships, I correct, including Whistlers. All flying close. I pull out and let us drop closer to the water. It will let Miranda and Sarah do what they need to do and also hopefully will let the Phoenix help break up our shape. Its achingly slow, but I keep her steady. Then Miranda and Sarah return to the gondola. Miranda stands by me and Sarah falls into an old, worn chair covered in pitted and ripped plastic. You got rid of our extra weight? I ask. Yes, sir, Sarah says. He should live, Miranda says. Though hes going to raise a fuss on the boat. Then I should pick up some speed, I say. How do you turn the lights on? No, Miranda says. No lights. She walks over to me, leans down, and switches on a screen set into the consol. It comes to life in brilliant light. Circles of light. It pulses. Is this... Radar, she says. Cmon, Ben. Take us out. I look at the radar display and see several bright dots, which I assume are the other ships. Ive heard of radar, of course, but I havent ever used it before. Most ships had them back in the Clean, but maintenance was difficult, and on most ships they broke down. Mal must be the luckiest bastard in the world to find a ship like this. Not to mention the Phoenix down below us. What kind of ship is this? I ask out loud. Surveillance, Miranda says. Hence all the screens. Makes sense, I think. Right now, though, all I care about is putting as much distance as I can between us and Mal. It takes just a few minutes of movement for the feeling to settle over me. This is it. This is where I belong. Where I should be. Not in a cell. Not on a ship. Not on the ground. I belong on an airship. Flying an airship. This is what Im meant for. Of course Im aware that this isnt mine. That this isnt the Cherub. But the Cherub is dead. I killed her. Miranda, I say. You got us out. You did it. I had been racking my brain for a way to get us out and Miranda did it. Thank you, I say. I realize right then how I was dreading being returned to my cell. Were not clear yet, Miranda says. I did my part. The next step is all yours. I continue to pull away from the Phoenix, accelerating ever so slightly while also increasing our elevation. Mal is not going to be happy, I say. It wont change much, she says. Hell still hate you. Hell just hate me, too. She shrugs. We have somewhere we need to be. People who depend on us. People who might be in danger. We needed wings. I got them for us. Shes absolutely right about that, and hearing her say that, the way that she says it, makes something swell in my chest. I want to grab her and kiss her right now. Then I think of what she just said. Did he ... did he tell you why he hates me? He told me enough, she says. He says you left him for dead. I think of that vision of Mal splattered in blood as Tess, Claudia, and I pulled away in the Beast. How our eyes locked. I consider lying. Just for a split-second. But for some reason I cant. Its the truth. I cant look at her. I know it for the cowardice that it is, but I still cant look. I expect ... I dont know, something from her. Reproach. Disappointment. Anger. Instead she just carries on as if it wasnt brought up. He talked to me quite a bit, she says. I think he took a liking to me. Who wouldnt? As I say it, I look down at the radar and for a moment think I see a blip moving on the edge of the outer circle. He brought me up here. Showed the ship off to me. He said it was an old surveillance ship that he found. Mal always was good at finding things, I say. There. Again. The hint of moving blip. The engines feel steady but I have no idea how fast they will move us or how quickly well be able to accelerate. The shape of this thing is unusual to me. I keep us moving slowly, almost inching us through the sky. Based on the arrangement of blips, I calculate the best exit. I move us up and to the right. Ive heard of ships like this, I say. They used them in the military, I think. Meant to float up in the sky and look down on people. I think many of them were unmanned. Remote operated. I heard of a guy, I think he was called the Hyena. He got hold of one and stripped out a lot of the equipmentthe computer stuff that didnt work and the cameras. Fitted it for people. Course they had to make it extra-large for him. On account of he laughed a lot? I frown. No, on account of he was fat. No, why he was called the Hyena. Oh. You got me, I say. It could have been because of his hygiene. Its true, she says. I read it. Hyenas were known for their laugh. Sure, maybe. I didnt know the man. But he had a ship like this. The moving blip blinks, then drops off of the radar. So far, so good. Malik said that it was used during the outbreak, Miranda says. This one was specifically designed for a team. They would chart the progress of the virus over citiesreport on any breakdowns in the system. They must have been really busy, I say. Yeah. They camouflaged it, too, though I think that might have been before it was tasked to monitor the virus. It has some special kind of envelope. Its supposed to help it blend in with the sky. Nice trick, I say. Miranda takes the moment to put my fathers revolver down next to me on the console. How did you get that? I ask. Malik had it. He kept it up here. I saw it on my visit. I thought you might want it back. I do, I say. Thanks. Thats two you owe me, she says. She holds up two fingers, but my attention is drawn to the radar screen and the blip thats reappeared there. Moving toward us. Shit. Weve got company. Where? she asks. I dont know. I can hear my voice getting louder. That way? I point in the general direction the blip is moving. Does this thing have any weapons? He didnt say. Shit. Then I remember that were running dark and that will help. If this was used when the shit came down, when the Bug scribbled all over the book that was the Clean, it should have automated gas distribution. The controls look familiar, so I start shifting gas and ballast so that well drop closer to the ocean. Im estimating here, and I cant see very well, but I set it for as close to the oceans surface as I can get without spilling us into it. Then I run to the opposite end of the gondola. The thing about gondolas is that you cant always see well out of them. Even if youre surrounded with windows, you typically have this massive structure above of you, blocking out anything thats not on your level or below. In the Clean, they used to use cameras to see where they were going, cameras and instruments like the Arguss radar. But not a lot of cameras have survived the Sick. A lot of us get around this by rigging up mirrors and other ways to see what we normally cant, only I cant seem to find any of those and dont even really know where to look. For all I know, some of these screens still work and Mal uses them. Or maybe he has so many escorts when he travels that they help spot for him. None of that helps me. There! Sarahs voice. Shes pointing out the side of the gondola, behind the control room. I see lights moving toward us. Keep your eyes on it, I say. Tell me whats happening. Then I return to the controls. Were nearer the waters surface now. I cant tell how close, but closer that Id usually like to be. Whats she doing? I call back to Sarah. Looks like shes coming after us. Down? Yeah. Bastard must be crazy. I suddenly think it must be Whistler, Chang, and the rest of them. Of course they must be used to flying over water. Must do it all the time. So its time to get creative. Mal, I think, I hope you kept this ship in good condition. If that is the Raven coming after us, then I know shes got the two large guns on her sides. I dont want to come under fire from those. I dont know how well this ship will stay together. I get as close as I can to the water and then level off. She still dropping? I ask. Yes! Sarah yells. Right on top of us. I watch the blip advance on the radar. Try to get a sense for the other ships speed. I keep our speed constant, but I make sure to keep all the engines up and running. Miranda, do you know how to turn the lights on? Outside this thing? I think so. But is that a good idea? Trust me. Get ready. All of them. Okay. The other ship gets closer and closer. By now they should be able to open fire on us and take us down, but my guess is that theyre not so eager to do that. Not this ship. Not the bosss ship. I hear the report of gunfire. Heavy caliber. And I jump. Maybe I was wrong. Any hits? I dont think so, calls Sarah. Miranda shakes her head. Shes right on top of us! Sarah yells. Oh my God. Then I do it. I signal to Miranda to hit the lights and I push the engines hard, straight up, cutting our forward speed. To give the ship a boost, I dump all of our ballast. In a ship like this, much of the ballast is held in tanks. As water. As we dump weight and the engines push hard, we gain lift and, at least relative to our pursuers, soar above them. Theyre coming in at a steep angle and shouldnt be able to correct so well. I can only watch it on the radar screen, watch as our two blips overlap for a moment. I steel myself for the scrape and shock of impact, but it doesnt come. Instead we slip through the night as water gushes from our hold and falls beneath us, on, Im hoping, the other ship. If so, it might help push them into the water, and getting out of that would be chore for anyone. Cut the lights, I say. And as we go black again, I change course and push out back toward the mainland on a different trajectory than before. I spare a look out the gondola window to see the lights of the other ship remaining where they were, either stuck in the sea or else struggling to regain control. Why the lights? Miranda asked. I shrug. I thought our sudden appearance from out of the darkness might give them a moments hesitation. Slow their reaction time. I think I was right. I scan the radar screen. We dont appear to be pursued by anyone else. Where are we headed now? Miranda asks, and I know what shes really asking. We cant really go to Tamoanchan with Sarah. Tamoanchan isnt too fond of strangers, and Im already on thin ice. Not to mention that Sarah would be trapped there once she knew its location. She seems like a decent kid, but I dont know her. Dont trust her. And that naval base was fucked to all hell. No, not Tamoanchan, unfortunately. Not yet. But I can put her down somewhere safe. Somewhere she can travel from probably pretty easily. Lord Tess. Huh? The knowledge broker. Shes who I visited to get help for Mal in the first place. I owe her anyway, for the information. Only thing is now some of Mals people know where she is. They might expect that Ill go back to her. Will that put her in danger? Miranda asks. I chew on my lip. Its a good question. I dont think so, I say. Tess is pretty well protected. And shes neutral. But that brings up another reason to go there. Whats that? She knows where the island is. What? I shrug. She knows things. Learns things. Finds out secrets. Someone who needed something must have sold out the location. So she can sell it to someone else? Theoretically. But shes not like that. That thing back then. With Mal. Tess was there. I got her out. Her and Claudia. I think I see something, Im not sure what, flit across Mirandas face. Are you sure about that? Her not being like that? Well, I say. I wouldnt mind reminding her of that fact. Then Lord Tess it is, she says. I plot our course.  What I told Sarah was that we were going to see Lord Tess and that she traded in information. Also that Tess had asked me for information on the naval base. I figured that if Tess wanted what information I had, that she would pay much more for the information that someone like Sarah had. Pay me what? Sarah asks. What else? Information. I dont understand. Informationabout settlements you could go to. Ships you could hook up with. Reliable captains to ferry you around. Sources of barter. Whatever you need. It may not seem like it, but thats a lot of value. So she barters. In information. Yes, I say. What did you use back on the base? She looks at me like I just asked her what direction the sun rises in. Money, she says. Money? Yes. Paper money? Yes, dollars. Jesus. Youre going to need an education if youre going to stay out here. Money went the way of clean streets and running water. Its all barter now. Barter. She nods. The only thing that matters is what you can use. And Tess barters information. Yes. Buying and selling. So I tell her about the base... And she gives you whatever information you want. If youve earned it, at least. Do you think she knows about the nuclear weapons? My mouth literally drops open. The what? The nukes. She looks ashamed as she says it. Theyre what weve been protecting all this time. Thats what the captain thought you were there to steal. My God, I said. Actual nukes. Probably within spitting distance from where I was being held. No wonder Danning went all paranoid. I started wondering if Tess did know about the nukes. I dont know if Tess knows, I say. But Id say thats certainly worth something. Im not going to betray my unit, she says. I dont think youll have to. Just answer the questions that you can. You know more than I do. Im sure shell reward you for it. She nods to herself. Then she looks up at me. I didnt ... its all so new. And you didnt know what you were getting into, I think. You just have to adapt, I say. Or else the world will chew you up and swallow you down. You have to change. She nods again, then meets my eyes, her posture suddenly straight. Im ready. She seems less sure as the three of us (Sarah, Miranda, and I) walk up the steps to the library. She seems nervous. I mean, Im nervous, too, but thats just because Im expecting Whistler and Chase and Orkney to appear from around every corner, armed to the gills, looking for an excuse to make me a greasy stain. Instead we just see Tess and her man, Rufus. Tesss guards stick to their shadows. Benjamin! Tess says. You made it back. She claps her wrinkled hands together and rubs them. It wasnt easy, I say. Tess holds up a gnarled finger. I have a feeling nothing is easy with you. Who are your friends? This part Ive been dreading. I take Mirandas hand, and she steps forward. This is ... Miranda. Lord Tesss smile is that of someone who just ate a whole bird. Smug and satisfied. My, my, my. Hello there, Miranda. Ive heard so much about you. Miranda looks at me questioningly. I ignore her. So, you are the woman whos altered Bens course. Im sorry? Oh, come now. This one was a by-the-numbers forager. Thats all he ever really cared about. But now theres you. Miranda frowns. How do you feel about him? Tess asks. I redden but realize that I want to know the answer. Not here, of course. Not in front of Tess and Sarah and Rufus. But at some point when we have some time together. This time Miranda smiles. I dont think thats any of your business. Tess laughs. Its deep and wet. She holds up her finger again. This one, she says. This one, Benjamin. I like her. Then to Miranda, Has he told you his middle name? Tess, I say, quickly trying to steer the conversation away, this is Sarah. Formerly of the US Navy. Despite her large, dark glasses, I can see Tesss eyebrows rise. Its almost worth it just for that. I figure she has a lot more to tell you than I could. Im sure thats worth something to you. You want her to pay off your debt? Lets just say that we came to an agreement. Shell give you your information. Shes looking to make a fresh start. Is that true? Tess asks. Sarah gives a quick, curt nod. It is, sir. I could use whatever help you can offer in that regard. Tess nods back, deeper. I think we can come to an arrangement. She smiles at Sarah. Then she looks at me. Why, Benjamin. Youre full of surprises. You did right by me; I want to do right by you. She nods in acknowledgment. I do have one favor to ask, though, I say. Oh? There are going to be people coming to look for me. Here. The people you were with before. Yes. I look down at my boots. Mals people. Maybe Mal himself. You burned him again, didnt you? It was me, Miranda says. But yes. Tess looks surprised again. And now his thugs are going to come looking for you here? Yes, I say. Im sorry. This is probably the first place theyll look. Lord Tess shakes her head and spares a look to Rufus. Rufus is flat-out frowning. Angry. You do leave chaos in your wake, dont you, Mister Gold? Tess says. I wince. Its true. As true as it gets. I dont think theyll bother you much, I say, trying to fill that uncomfortable moment with words. They have no cause to. Theyll just be looking for me. You know Malik has no love for me, Tess says. Our history is almost as bad as yours. I find that hard to believe, I say. Ehhh. She tilts her head to the side. Not convinced. Youre too valuable, and not just to him, to have anything happen to you. She looks at me and shakes her head, as if Im an ignorant child. Benjamin, when its personal, people are capable of anything. Rules dont matter, outcomes dont matter. Only that surge of feeling when you render justice unto your enemy. I stare back at her, unsure of what to say. Instead, she says, But I think that youre right. I dont think that Malik will harm me. What he will do is ask me where youve gone. And youll say you dont know. Her face breaks into a smile, though its one without any mirth in it. But I do know where youre going. I keep my eyes on Tess, but I can feel Miranda looking at me. Tess... Im almost sure that this is going to cost me more. Tess is always concerned with fair bartering. Tess waves a hand in the air. Dont worry, Benjamin, she says. I have no love for Malik either. He couldnt pay the price of that information. Youll get away fine. She turns and shuffles back to her makeshift throne. Besides, she says, I still feel like theres some credit left for getting me out on the Cherub all those years ago. She lowers herself into the chair. I can almost hear her bones creaking and popping. She sighs as her body settles. She reaches for one of the hardbound books piled next to her chair, picks up the top one. Who would have thought these things would outlive us? She tosses it back onto the pile. I clasp my hands together like Im praying. Thank you, Tess. She just nods. Then her head jerks up and she snaps her fingers. Wait, she says. Yes? When you were here before, you were asking about Gastown, werent you? Yes... Some traders came through here yesterday. I took whatever they could give me, like I usually did. Where theyve been, what they saw, etcetera. They mentioned about a camp that they delivered to. They said it was run by some folks out of Gastown. Oh? Yes. They said that it was strange for Gastown. That it was a camp full of scientists. I look at Miranda. Her eyes widen. I nod at Tess. Wed heard Gastown was working with a group of scientists. The Cabal. Some of the smartest people left in the Sick, allied with some of the most vicious. Thats just the thing, Tess says. Id heard those stories as well, of course. Theyre not new. No, this was different. This wasnt just a camp. It was a prison camp. A prison camp? A group of prisoners from a science commune. They talked to one or two of the prisoners. Said they were taken some weeks back. She snaps her fingers. The place had a funny name. She picks up a notepad and flips through the pages. Miranda moves forward and grabs my arm. Was it Apple Pi? Tess looks up at her and smiles. Yes. Thats it. How did you know? Miranda knows because that was her camp. Where her and her boffins worked for a cure. Only it got hit by Gastown raiders while Miranda, Sergei, and Clay were off in the field. I was there to see it taken. Up until now, we werent sure what had happened to the other boffinswhether they had been captured or killed. But it sounds like some of them are alive. We need the location of that camp, Miranda says. Tess smiles widely, her wrinkled face cracking around it. What would you like to trade for it? Miranda thinks for a moment, then smiles, too. Do you have something that reads old tech? Its a portable data drive. Tess smiles and nods. She holds out a hand to Rufus, and he disappears behind the curtain, coming back with a small, portable computer. Miranda reaches into her pocket and pulls out the drive she stole from Gastown. The drive with the data on the Bug, the data that the Gastown scientists were working with. Right now, it might be the most valuable thing in the world to Miranda. Shes hoping to use it to find a cure. Right here is data on the Maenad virus, she says. What people call the Bug. Possibly more advanced than anything Ive seen before. Tess tilts her head and shifts in her chair. It sounds valuable and yet ... you know theres not much call for scientific data these days. Maybe, Miranda says. But its extremely rare. Maybe youll never have cause to use it, but one day, if someone comes in here looking for something like this, wont you be mad at yourself if you let it slip through your fingers? I take it these scientists are friends of yours? Tess asks. Miranda nods once. Very dear friends of mine. Weve been looking for them for some time. Tess starts wagging her head from side to side. She looks to Rufus and sighs. She shakes her head. Dont pay attention to this, Rufus, she says. Im a big softy. Ill bend for people I like. She looks back to Miranda. Okay. She reaches down the side of her chair and pulls up the notebook and a pen. Im guessing you can read. Yes, Miranda says. Good. Tess flips back through the book and uses a finger to trace the words that are written on one of the pages. Then she flips to a fresh page and starts writing. Rufus, she says. Collect the data. Rufus moves forward with the portable computer, and Miranda moves forward with the drive. She hands it over. Be careful with it, she says. Its very important. I will, Rufus says, slightly offended. He slots the drive into the side of the computer, then turns it toward him and presses a few keys. Let me know when its done, Tess says. I know what Mirandas risking hereif something were to go wrong and her drive were to short or be corrupted or just die, well, there goes a chance to advance her research. On the other hand, thats Mirandarisking everything for her people. I think back to the Cherub and think its her example Ive been following. Done, Rufus says. He carefully removes the drive and hands it back to Miranda. Thank you, she says, and she replaces it in her shirt pocket, snapping it closed. Tess nods and rips off the notebook page and holds it out to Miranda. I dont have an exact location, but I do know the route of the traders, and I got them to give me landmarks. Thank you, Miranda says again. She neatly folds the paper and tucks it into her jacket pocket. Now I think we should leave, I say. No offense, Tess, but I dont want to be here if Whistler and Maliks other friends show up. Go, Tess says with a wave. You might scare off other customers. I nod and turn to go. And Benjamin, she says. I turn back. Good luck. I think youre going to need it. Always, I say with a self-effacing smile. Good luck to you, Sarah, I say. Remember what I said about change. She salutes me in response, and I repeat the motion back. Then, my hand on Mirandas back, we head back toward the Argus.         TWELVE I think we should rename the ship, I say, as I take her up. Its not like were taking her back to Mal. Miranda sighs. What do you want to name it? Not the Cherub again. No, I say. There was only one Cherub. And not something similar, she says. What? I mean, Ben, the Cherub? Its an Old Testament thing, I say. The Torah, the Bible. Angels. Big, scary, powerful things. Thats funny, she said. I always had heard that they were flying babies in diapers. No, I say. Jesus. They were scary, Miranda. I shake my head. Read a fucking book thats not about virology once in a while. She smiles back at me. So what then? I remember a story back from my childhood. One of my fathers books. An angel that could see in all directions. Covered in eyes. Thats basically what this ship is. The thousand-eyed angel of death. Dumah, I say. The Dumah? Yeah. She narrows her eyes. What does it ... never mind. I dont want to know. Youre the one flying it. The Dumah it is. I nod. The Dumah. It works. Ben. Miranda holds up the paper that Tess gave her. I think that we should go to this camp now. I keep the ship steady and turn to Miranda, crossing my arms. I disagree. Why not, Ben? Miranda asks, her voice rising. My God, those peoplemy peopletrapped there all this time. These are my friends. I know, I say. And I want to get them out, too, but its just the two of us. And this ship isnt rigged for carrying a whole bunch of people. Were not prepared for this. I have one gun. One. And only a few bullets left. She turns away, shaking her head. Not to mention that we dont know if Tamoanchan is okay, I say. Lets say we could even get your people out. Where do we go if Tamoanchan is gone? What do we do if its full of Gastown thugs? I think thats our immediate priorityhead to the island and figure out the fallout there. Then, as soon as we can, get help to go rescue your scientists. She looks down. I know youre worried about your people. Each one of them. But we need to check on Sergei. And Clay, she says, looking up at me. I guess, I say. She punches me in the arm. And Diego, I say. She squeezes my arm. He chose to go to Gastown, you know. I shake my head. After I goaded him into it. Hes his own man. Miranda... I dont finish the sentence. It all seems too big. What I did to get us to Gastown. How Diego paid for it. How Tamoanchan might have paid. Just because I wanted my ship. And now that shes gone, what was it for? You sacrificed the Cherub, Miranda says, as if reading my mind. Dont forget that. You gave up the thing you loved most to try to save all of them. Its true. I loved the Cherub all my life. But was it what I loved the most? Miranda, I say, lifting her chin. Ben! she says suddenly. Loudly. Looking past me. She points. I turn to look. One of the screens has flickered to life. How the hell did that happen? Did you do something? I flicked a few of the switches before, but I didnt think they would work. Looks like it did. One bank of screens has ten monitors in it. Two of these are operating, showing ... sky. The second bank of screens is showing us the ground. At least on the three monitors that are working. One is a high-level view. Another, closer up. The third, well, Im not sure what Im looking at. It makes sense, Miranda says. Some to see around you, for flight. Some to see below you, for study. Whats that one? I ask, pointing to the strange monitor. The images there are just colors against a black background. Miranda looks, then frowns, then screws up her lips. Then she smiles. I think its infrared. What? Infrared. I heard you. I dont know that that means. Oh. She pats me on the back in a really condescending way that I hate. Thermal imaging. It reads heat signatures. Really? Really. The lighter colors are hotter signatures, the darker ones, cooler. I would guess they used this at night when they couldnt get a clear optical picture. Or they might have even used it through walls. People would show up hotter than their surroundings. Fires, I say. What? They could spot fires, too. I have a sudden image of people aboard the Dumah, a crew of them, several manning the monitors. Shifting cameras, maybe. Communicating down with the ground. Im thinking of when the shit went down. There were probably a lot of fires. Probably, Miranda says. So its functional then. Partly at least. The cameras. Looks like it, Miranda says. And you just pushed a few buttons. More of them might work. Maybe someone at Tamoanchan can look at it. Work something out. Miranda nods. Maybe. Im trying to think what we could use this for. It begs the question, of course, what were going to be doing in the future. I guess it comes down to whats going on with Tamoanchan. I look at Miranda from the corner of my eyes. Do you ever see us going back to the way things were? I ask. What do you mean? Miranda asks. Me flying you to Feral nests, you going down to the ground, taking samples. That kind of thing. Im thinking that this ship would give us a better sense of where Ferals might be hiding. And how many. This kind of ship, back then, would have made things a lot easier. Miranda bends down over the monitors, tracing something on the screen with her finger. There is no back, she says, echoing something she said to me long ago. Once more, I have to agree with her.  Ive been keeping track of our position on a map that Mal had handy. Actually, a series of maps. Luckily theres enough of the sea and coast, which is no real surprise considering the course he was taking. According to the position I charted, Tamoanchan should be in sight soon. I already have the radio lit and set to the frequency that Tamoanchan uses. They dont know this ship, so they might see us as a threat. If theyre still there. By blowing up the Cherub, I managed to take out the ships that were heading there from Gastown. Those ships intended to drop infected Ferals onto the island. I assumed they were only the first wave. That more ships would be coming. What Id been hoping for was that my sacrifice could buy them time to get the island evacuated. So I dont know what Im going to find. One of the best-case scenarios involves an abandoned Tamoanchan, all the people off somewhere else, pissed and unhappy, but safe and alive. The worst-case scenarios are, well, worse. For all I know, we could be flying to a ruined city. Or one thats been taken over by Gastown. Thats the scenario I fear the most. That well fly into sight and raiders will be all over us like flies on a carcass. This ship has neither the speed of the Cherub nor the armaments of many others. Dont get me wrongits a sleek, impressive ship, but not much good against a group of raiders. Its difficult to know why Gastown does what it does. When the raiders took Gastownfree, independent Gastown, I mean, the city in the sky that wasthey kept it. Which made sense. It was a trading city. Valuable. Strategic. And of course it had the only dependable source of helium around. Of course you keep that. But they dont always keep things. When they hit the Core, where Miranda and her scientists had set up camp, a place they called Apple Pi (thats a dumb nameMirandas going to give me shit about the name of the Cherub when she worked in a place called that?), they didnt take it. They torched it. Gutted it. But then left. I guess there wasnt anything there worth holding on to. Have I mentioned that I hate those raiders? Miranda comes up behind me and rubs my arm. Somehow it helps. I guess I know that Im not facing this alone. I hope that Sergeis okay. Hes like a surrogate father to Miranda, of course, but I really like the guy myself. He was the first of Mirandas boffins that I met. Hes not the liveliest of guys but ... I care about him. Id hate to lose him. By now I can make out the dark spot of land thats Tamoanchan, an island far enough off the coast that it doesnt get stumbled upon very often, but large enough and flat enough that a settlement could set up there, a real city with wooden buildings and, because of the water surrounding it, security. Ferals cant just wander in. Only the Bug. Infected people. Which is why the islands secrecy is carefully guarded and they vet everyone who goes there. I kinda ... . skipped that vetting process. I helped out two of their people, a man named Diego and his sister, Rosie. They were out looking for ship captains to help keep them supplied. I helped them escape from some raiders, and they figured that was a good-enough audition. Later, after the Core was sacked, I took Miranda and Sergei and Clay there (though Clay was not my idea). It didnt go as well as I expected. That was mostly due to the fact that Miranda, Sergei, and Clay insisted upon bringing a live Feral with them. Batshit crazy, of course. But they were studying it. Miranda calls it Alpha. It has some kind of mutation. Some alteration of the Bug that helps her studies. So she brought it with her, and it got us all thrown into cells (something Im developing a talent for) and almost got us killed. But I was able to convince the Tamoanchan Council that Miranda was onto something. That she had the best chance of working out the Bug. Of building something like a detection system, if not a cure. They set her people up on a nearby island that would hopefully help protect the main island from contamination. I thought that meant Miranda would be safe, but then she decided to come with me to Gastown while I chased after the Cherub. And now were full circle, back to Tamoanchan. Its not a large island, but not really tiny either. Its ... medium. And growing larger in the window by the second. So far, it looks the same. I mean, I think it looks the same. Does it look the same to you? I ask Miranda. She presses herself against the window, trying to see. I look over to the monitors, but none of them are currently showing the island. It slowly grows larger. Then, as were both watching, both of us tense and unwilling to even guess what might have happened, the radio crackles to life. Passcode, a voice says. Shit. Someones down there. But friend? Or enemy? I grab the microphone. Tamoanchan, this is Ben Gold and Miranda Mehra. We dont have a passcode. Were just returning to the island. We came to see if you were okay. After a brief pause, the voice, male, comes back. Ben Gold? Yes. Another pause. It seems like they recognize the name, but because I spent time on Tamoanchan, or because I fucked with a bunch of Gastown raiders? You know the eastern landing ground? the voice asks, after a moment. Yes, I say. Proceed there. Someone will meet you. I look at Miranda. What do you think? We both look out at the island. There are a few bright spots that are probably airships low down the way that Tamoanchan used to keep them, but they could be anyones ships. I think we have to go, Miranda says, resigned. Me, too. So I bring the Dumah around to the eastern landing ground. Keeping the ships down low means that they cant be spotted easily from the sky. They have a hydrogen operation, several, actually, that help refill the ships and let them lift off if grounded. I see the usual assortment of ships, but have they just been captured? I try to see the Osprey, Diego and Rosies ship, but I dont. Which doesnt necessarily mean anythingthere are several places they stash ships. On the Dumahs belly cameras I can see a small crew near a securing station, a place where theyve made it easy to anchor. I try to make out what theyre wearing. Valhalla raiders favor furs and leathers. As good as the cameras are, I cant seem to get that level of detail. I drop our anchor, and the crew helps secure it. I lower the Dumah closer to the ground, then send Miranda to drop the ladder. Before we leave the hatch, we face each other. I wish youd kept the gun I gave you, I say. I still have the dart gun, she says. A pistol that shoots small tranquilizer darts. Its better than nothing. She straightens my jacket, presses lightly against the star still affixed to my coat. Lets go. I go first, figuring if they take a shot Id rather it get me than her. But none come. I lower myself to the ground, then approach the crew. The way the sun is coming down through the trees, its hard for me to make them out. My fingers itch for my revolver. I stay close to Miranda. Then I can make out the crew. Three people, two men and a woman. I think I recognize one of them from my time here before. From the original Tamoanchan. Part of me relaxes, unclenches. I suddenly realize that Im holding Mirandas hand. I give it a squeeze now that I am starting to realize that were among friends. Then one of the men pulls a gun on us, because of course he does. I have that kind of luck.  They treat us better than Mal did (or at least better than Mal treated me; Miranda seems to have fared just fine). And much better than those Navy assholes. They take our weapons, but they put Miranda and me in the same placenot a cell, but something slightly cozier. But bare. There are guards outside. What do you think is going on? I ask. Miranda smiles. The usual Ben Gold charm. I laugh. We dont wait long. The door opens and four people walk in. I recognize one of them. Brana. Short blonde hair, hard face. Shes the leader of the Tamoanchan Council. She was the one who questioned us the first time we came to the city. With her is a man with Asian ancestry, a scar on the left side of his jaw. Looks almost like a burn. Theyre flanked by two Tamoanchan peacekeepers wearing their brown and green and carrying rifles. None of them are smiling. None of them look happy to see us. Brana shakes her head. I knew you would be trouble the first time you came here. I should feel apprehensive about all of this, but I dont. I feel calm, somehow. Relaxed. I think its partly because were here. Theyre here. Tamoanchan survived. You were the one who let us stay, I say. She nods. A mistake that Ill no doubt continue to pay for. You know, I say, I get the feeling youre not too happy with me right now. Should I be? Her face twists as if in disgust. She points a stiff arm at me, first finger extended. You were supposed to stay here. Instead you convince Diego to take you to Gastown, risking our location. Compromising our location. All for what? To get your ship back? I notice you didnt bring it with you. Did you find something better? Does anything really matter to you? You have no idea what youre talking about, Miranda says, moving forward. Theres a faint flush in her face, the kind that she gets when shes excited about some data, or when shes angry. Ben got his ship, and then he sacrificed it. We almost sacrificed our liveswe were ready toto save all of you. Branas still frowning, showing no reaction. Ben took out the raiders that were headed here. He was trying to do right by you. Im not surprised that Miranda has my back, but it still feels good. Branas tough, but Mirandas tougher. Brana crosses her arms. Yet our location is still compromised. In the hands of the worst possible people. Ben wasnt the one who told them, Miranda says, her voice low and steady. I grimace. It was Diego. But Im the one who put him in that position in the first place. Can we stop this? I ask. Miranda and I came back because we needed to make sure you were okay. And yes, I blew up my ship to stop the raiders from reaching you. I know you still think of us as outsiders, but we both want to be here. Im sorry that I got Diego involved in all of this, and Im sorry for what happened to him. I cant take any of that back. But I was hoping that I could help you. That I could fix this. Now. Brana raises an eyebrow. How? We were on Gastown. We have some idea about what youre up against. About what were all up against. I just want to figure out a way to keep Tamoanchan safe. And Miranda, well ... Ill let her talk about that. Miranda crosses her arms over her chest. First I want to know who this is. She gestures to Branas companion. Im Lewis, he says. Hes the leader of the minority party on the Council, Brana says. I realize that I dont have the slightest idea of how the Tamoanchan Council works. I suppose I shouldnt be surprised that they have different parties, but I just assumed Brana was fully in charge. I put out my hand. Im Ben, and this is Miranda. Lewis takes my hand, tentatively, and says, I know. I suppose my reputation precedes me. He flashes me an amused smile. You could say that. You said you have something, Brana says impatiently. I have data, Miranda says. Data I took from Gastown. It should help advance our research immeasurably. Meaning what, exactly? Lewis asks. Its the first time hes shown interest in any of this. Meaning that were closer to a cure, Miranda says. But perhaps even closer to what Ben promised you when we first came here. A detection system for the virus. The mans eyes widen. Brana shakes her head. Look, I say. Were here. You have us. Why not just sit down and put it all on the table. Talk this through. Then you can decide what you want to do with us. Brana seems to mull it over in her mind. The man looks at her, then back at me. I think an exchange of information is warranted. I nod at Lewis. Then maybe we can start by talking about what happened here? When we left Gastown, Rosie had Diego on board the Osprey and they were headed straight here. Miranda and I flew to try to intercept the raiders and succeeded. With a little luck and a lot of foolishness, we managed to take them all out. What does that mean? Lewis asks. There were five ships. Three were carrying live Ferals. Its a tactic they used back when they attacked Gastown. They drop the Ferals in ahead of their attacklet the panic set in, and then come in afterward to mop up. So what did you do? Lewis asks. My lips curl up in a grim smile. I flew my ship right in the middle of them and blew her up. Made quite a pretty light show. How did you survive? Brana asks. We jumped out of the ship in a raft, Miranda says. We fell into the water. Lewis looks at me like Im crazy. Fair enough. I shrug. Thats ... hard to believe, he says. Youre telling me, I say. So what happened here while we were doing the impossible? Lewis leans back in his chair. Rosie and Diego made it back and raised the alarm, so we started an evacuation. So you were off of the island before the attack came? I ask. Thats just it, Lewis says. There was never any attack. What? We evacuated and had a few ships come back to check on the island, and no other ships came. None? Lewis shakes his head. That doesnt make sense, I say. Maybe, Miranda says. When you found Diego, you said it seemed like he had just told his interrogator about Tamoanchan. Maybe a small group left Gastown right away without being able to assemble a larger group. Maybe we got all of them. I remember what Tess told me the first time I visited her. I did hear that with the disruption down at the plant, they had sent a number of ships there. That might have prevented them from sending a larger force. But surely they would have recorded the location. Maybe, Miranda said. Could they really have lost the location? Or could they really not care? We need more information, I say. Brana nods, then shakes her head. Of course. And youre the one to find it, right? Leave the island again? I dont think so. Someone should. Things are starting to come together in my mind, but Im not ready to bring them up yet. So they didnt come here. Thats good. How is Diego? Brana looks at her boots. Hes recovering. His wounds were substantial, but none of them life-threatening. His sisters been caring for him. Good, I say. Rosie would defend him to the death. Of course, Im probably not her favorite person right now, but Ill still need to see him. What happened after you fell into the water? Brana asks. How did you get out? Ill tell you, I say. But can we sit down at least? Its been a long couple of weeks. So we all sit like civilized people. Except that their side has two armed guards on it and, judging by the way theyre standing, theyve been given orders to shoot if necessary. Miranda is next to me, close by. Lewis and Brana are opposite us, but with adequate space between the two of them. I tell them both the whole story, going back to what happened after I left Tamoanchan. How I went to Gastown with Miranda, Rosie, and Diego. How we met Claudia there. How Rosie and I went with Claudia down to the helium plant to check it out. How we found evidence of Gastown scientists experimenting with Ferals. Miranda fills them in on what she and Diego got up to back on the floating city. Then together we take them through leaving Gastown, taking out the raiders, and then an abbreviated version of what happened with Mal, the naval base, and escaping. By the end, Lewis is looking at us incredulously. All of that happened in the past few weeks? Just about, I say. I left out a few things.  Quarantine is painfulthree days of confinement and restricted rationsbut in the end they let us back into Tamoanchan. Its late afternoon as we walk up to Diego and Rosies house. Its a simple, wooden dwelling. Theyve taken the time to paint it in a light color thats not quite white but not quite anything else. Their door, however, is green. I realize that the houses colors are pretty close to the Ospreys colors, their airship, and I raise my appreciation. What are you smiling at? Miranda asks, and I remember what were here for and chase the smile from my face. Diego. The last time I saw him, his face resembled ripe fruit more than it resembled a face. His dark-brown skin had been covered in cuts and bruises, one eye swollen shut, his face stained with his own blood. I didnt see the torture, but I could see its marks. They had broken him. A more steadfast man I couldnt imagine. And they broke him. Im sometimes afraid to think of how. Are you going to knock? Miranda asks. I want to. I need to. But I hesitate. This is all my fault. Just do it, Ben, Miranda says. And so I do. I reach out and knock on the door. It opens a moment later. Rosie appears in the doorway. Shes taller than Miranda, though not as tall as memuscular, hard. Her long, dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail and she wears a worn baseball cap on top of it. Whatever logo or symbol it might have sported has long been worn away. When she sees us, her eyes widen at first, then narrow. As she looks at me, her face twists into a disgusted frown. Hello, Rosie, I say. Shes silent for a long moment. Her expression doesnt move. She just stares at me. Then. You have a lot of nerve coming here. I wanted to see Diego. She closes her eyes for a moment, tilts her head to the side. Then a wide smile crests her face, a humorless smile, and she opens her eyes and shakes her head. After what you did to him. Rosie, Miranda says. Diego made his own choices. And Ben got him out. Rosies face goes hard. He wouldnt have been there if not for you, she says in a low, cold voice. I know, I say. And if I could go back and change that, I would. If I could take his place, I would. Fuck you, she says. Just... Can I see him for a moment? Rosie continues to shake her head, then turns toward the door, one arm on its edge. Hes still not healed, she says. I nod. I dont know why. I just dont know what else to do. And based on the last time I saw him, of course hes not healed. Those bastards took him apart. The visible scars will probably be the least of his worries. I think then that shes not going to let us in to see him. That shell keep me out because she blames me for what happened to him, and I dont blame her for blaming me. Rosie, Miranda says, Ben did all he could to save you. All of you. He was ready to sacrifice his life for that. So was Miranda, I say. Rosie looks up at me. Her face doesnt soften, not even the least bit, but her eyes narrow as if shes searching me. Then a voice comes from behind her. Let them in, Rose. Diegos voice, deep and warm and rumbly. Rosie looks back at him. Cmon, Rose, he says. I want to see them. Rosie steps back from the door and pulls it back with her, gesturing in with her hand. I step inside, Miranda right behind me. Diego is standing behind her, where the light from outside dims. Hes wearing a wool cap, and beneath it his face is healing. There are scabs and bruises on his dark skin, but the knitting has begun. He still looks like shit, though. Diego, I say. I hold out my hand to shake, but Diego grabs it and pulls me in, slapping a large hand on my back. Thank you, he says. For getting me out. Thats not ... you dont need to thank me, I say. He pulls back and looks me in the eyes. No, I do. He smiles at me, but I think I see something behind it. Pain? Or something else? Miranda steps forward and hugs Diego. Shes all but swallowed up in his bulk. Im so glad youre okay, she says. Likewise, he says. Back on Gastown, while Rosie and I had infiltrated the helium plant, Diego and Miranda had investigated together. At the time it had driven me crazyMiranda would barely talk to mebut now Im glad for it. Of course while they seem to have bonded because of their time together, Rosie hates my guts. I dont think your sister is a fan, I say to Diego. Diego sighs and waves a hand. Shell get over it. Shes just protective of her big brother. How are you doing? Miranda asks. Mending, Diego says. The pain gets a little less every day. The bones are knitting back together. I wince at that. You look better, I say. Diego shifts uncomfortably. There are some good doctors here, he says. He nods, perhaps a bit too emphatically. They took very good care of me. He looks up at me. Did I really look that bad? I get that same image of his face, swollen and beaten and broken. You werent at your best, I say. Though better than a Ferals ass. His smile fades to stone seriousness. If you hadnt gotten me out ... I dont know if ... I couldnt have lasted much longer. Now its my turn to shift uncomfortably. I shake my head. Lets just say were even. His face widens in surprise and he immediately winces. Even? he asks. For getting me to Gastown so I could get my ship. He thinks about this for a moment. Nods. How is she? he asks. It shocks me for a moment, his question, and I quickly look away. She didnt make it, I say, not knowing what else to say. As soon as its out, I regret it. Diego is starting at me, wide-eyed. Then he starts shaking his head again and again. Then all of that... Ben gave up the Cherub, Miranda says. He sacrificed it to stop the raiders headed here. He almost sacrificed his life. So did Miranda, I repeat. I can feel Diegos eyes sharply on me, but Im looking at Miranda. You almost died? For Tamoanchan? I feel heat flush my face, and I suddenly want to be somewhere else. I didnt really think it through, I say. It happened so fast. Diego starts nodding. Then thank you again. I nod back. But the urge to run for the door remains. You know what? Diego says. I think this calls for a drink. Absolutely, I say, the urge to run suddenly forgotten. Then, Can you drink? We dont have a lot of fancy painkillers, he says. So I pretty much have to. Rosie brings in a bottle and some smudged glasses. Shes not looking at me. Even if Diego seems okay with me, she is definitely not. I flash back to something she said to me a little while ago when we were looking for the Cherub. She knew what to look for. She told me the first time we had met that she had been looking for ways to take the Cherub down. If it became necessary. It gave me a shiver then and it gives me one now. The liquor is brown, like whiskey. But it doesnt look like something from the Clean. What is this? Something one of our locals makes, Diego says. He picks up his glass and turns it around, looking at the liquid inside. He distills his own alcohol and even has some old oak barrels he found or bartered for. He ages it in those. He raises his glass to me and Miranda. We follow suit. To the Cherub. I toast, then take a sip. Its strong, almost creamy. Slightly sweet. There are definitely flavors I cant identify. Impressive, I say. He nods. Miranda raises her glass. To Tamoanchan. We all take a drink. Then it seems like its my turn. I raise my glass. Look at Rosie, then Diego, then Miranda. To ending the Sick, I say. It surprises me, but I realize that I mean it. Not just the Bug, not just Mirandas cure, but Valhalla, the raiders, Gastown, the death and destructionall of it. Miranda catches my eye, a strange expression on her face, then we all take a drink. Mine is long and deep. I wipe my mouth with the back of my gloved hand. Were all silent for a moment. Then Diego says, So whats next for you two? I take another sip of this pretty amazing whiskey and then I shrug. The Council isnt too happy with me right now. They even confiscated the ship we took from Mal. Mal? Oh, right. I fill him in on everything that happened since we left him at Gastown, finishing with our days in quarantine after Brana and Lewis left. Miranda chimes in when I get to the information that we got from Tess. My friends are out there. She shakes her head. Possibly being tortured. Certainly being mistreated. I need to get them back. Can you put in a word with the Council? I ask Diego. Diego looks at his drink and shakes his head. The Council... One large, brown hand curls into a fist. Gastown screwed me. Oh. He raises his head and meets my eyes. Im lucky Im not in a cell right now. I think its only because there wasnt an invasion that Im not. As it is, theyve cut me out. He takes a drink of his whiskey. Finishes the glass and refills it. They let me stay here, but I might as well be a prisoner for all theyll let me do. I hear Rosie make a noise, a growl or something, deep in her throat and she turns and walks out of the room. So were all in the same boat, Miranda says. Grounded, I say. We all reach for our drinks. Do you both have a place to stay? Diego asks. Im trying to head out to see Sergei and Clay, Miranda says, but they said I wouldnt be able to get a ship until tomorrow because of the patrols theyre still running. I shake my head. Then you should stay here, with us. Diego, Rosie says from the next room. We have the room, he says. Its simple, but... That would be great, I say. I look to Miranda. She nods. Thank you, she says. Diego, Rosie repeats. Can I talk to you? Diego gives me a look as if to say, Im in for it, then stands up and leaves the room. I notice that the effort pains him, though he does his best to act as if it doesnt. We can hear their low voices in the next room, but I find I dont want to hear what theyre saying. I know most of it. Rosie doesnt want us here. For a moment I think about telling him well find another place. But we have no other real friends here. No barter. And I want Miranda to feel safe for a night. Rosies voice raises and I hear the words all that happened and a few moments later, ruined your reputation. I throw back the rest of my drink and only then realize that Mirandas way ahead of mealready halfway through her second glass. As usual. This is going well, I say. Shell get over it, Ben, Miranda says. Maybe she shouldnt, I say. Shell get over it, Miranda repeats. I nod, but I dont know that I believe it. A few moments later, Diego returns to the room and leans against the doorway. You can stay, he says. Im sorry, we dont have a spare bed. We barely have beds ourselves, but we have some blankets we can lay down in front of the stove. Youll have to share. I look at Miranda and raise my eyebrows. She says to Diego, That will be fine. Thank you. Good, he says. Then were all set. He settles back into his chair and reaches for his glass. Whos ready for more? Me, I say, perhaps a little too eagerly. I slide my glass forward. Diego fills it. The three of us toast again wordlessly. Rosie doesnt join us.  The blankets smell very clean, and we lay them on the floor in front of the stove. The stove is an interesting contraption, made of iron that was probably resmelted somewhere along the way. It burns wood, and a pipe carries the smoke outside. The island gets chilly at night, but the area around the stove is nice and warm. I shed my jacket, then my shirt and pants until Im in my underclothes. It feels strange to be so uncovered around other people. I feel vulnerable. But I also realize that for a little while Ive stopped thinking about the Bug and being infected. I know that Miranda and I havent been together the whole time but, and it goes against everything Ive known and felt my entire life, Im not worried about her infecting me. Its against all my instincts, but then they seem ridiculous right now. So I slip under the blankets, and they feel warm and soft against my skin. Miranda likewise strips down to her underwear, a simple pair of underpants and a bra. Theyre from the Clean, I see. The elastic is loose and puckered, the color faded to a gray, but shes obviously kept them clean and taken care of them. I feel myself go hard at the sight of her so unclothed. Its not something I see very often. Ferals dont count. She slides under the blankets next to me and that hardness gets, well, harder. I didnt think my body could be hotter, but the temperature under my skin ratchets up another few hundred degrees. I can feel Mirandas presence next to me. Its like shes pulsing, giving off waves of force. I dont look at her. My mouth is dry, my teeth gritted together. I can smell the soft, homey scent of the blankets and my own sweat and Mirandas scent, the smell of her skin, and theres this maddening fuzziness in my head. My cheeks flush. Ben, she says, and moves closer to me, leaning into my body. My arm goes around her and pulls her close, and that heat, that fuzz, intensifies. I feel like a metal cable vibrating, thrumming, at her touch. Miranda, I say, and turn toward her. Her smell is all in my nostrils, her body against mine. I am almost blind and deaf and dumb. Some kind of wave rises in me, and as if we have no choice at all, my mouth moves forward, and hers does too, and we find each other, and our warmth mixes together. I dont know how I can be hard and liquid at the same time. My thoughts disappear. Skin against skin. Lips on lips. What remains of our clothes slid and pushed away by fingers and toes and friction, glorious friction. I lose myself. The world comes together in brief momentsa glimpse of her light-brown skin, the hardness of a nipple under my fingers, then my tongue, her hand on my cock. But each moment is washed away by this intense feeling, this physical euphoria that rises from my center, up my chest, and into my neck and extremities. Miranda climbs on top of me, and we move together, and I gasp and the whole world disappears and just ... pleasure. Pleasure. Bliss. Ecstasy. And need. Building need. Were breathing hard and gasping and biting and kissing and sliding down this slope, and I feel it building and building and building and then, in a moment of startling clarity, I lift Miranda off of me as I come and my whole body shudders with her in my arms, and we lay, panting against each other, sweaty and, slightly later, serene. For a short while, I lay there, trying to take all of this in. Trying to hold on to this small, perfect island of contentment in a dark and dangerous sea. Then, when I feel like I have it, I roll Miranda over and move down her body, my head ending up between her legs. A different kind of intimacy as I move my tongue, exploring Mirandas body, tasting her, feeling her move and hearing her gasps and moans. I listen for her sounds and respond to her movements, and she gets louder and fasterthen her legs grip my head and she lets out a last strangled sound and then relaxes. I crawl back up to her, and we fall asleep against one another. As I slip into that sleep, I think, Were going to have to wash Diegos blankets.         THIRTEEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Ben and I had sex last night. Its something thats been building for months, the physical tension, I mean, and I can say that it didnt disappoint. Ben was ... Ben was passionate, and unrestrained in a way that surprised me. He can be so careful, so controllingwhat comes from a life focused on survivalbut I felt that he was just there with me, in the moment, and the world, the world he fears, stopped existing for a brief, glorious moment. Only ... its more complicated than that. Of course sex is sex, and it doesnt always have to be something significant, but in this case theres a lot happening beneath the surface, a lot of emotions and feelings and ... theyre complicated. I have to admit that I still havent quite gotten over what Malik told me about their past. Im sure Ben could explain it in a way that would make sense to meand I know that he was a different person back thenbut he left someone behind. Someone he possibly considered a friend. And that chills me. And though I tell myself that hes a different man now, that he was willing to sacrifice not just his ship but his life for Tamoanchan, I cant seem to forget that. Its related, I have to guess, to the prison camp. To the idea of leaving people behind. And knowing that a group of my people, people I have worked beside as we try to figure out Maenad, are sitting in a prison camp run by our enemies. Who knows what they might be facing? Torture? Starvation? Executions? I cant stop thinking about it. It kept me awake. After Ben had fallen asleep, I lay in his arms for a time. But I couldnt sleep. I fell in and out. Like I was back on the ocean, in the raft, constantly juggled by the sea. So when I heard Diego stirring, and saw him go outside, I followed him into the predawn air. He looked like he was having a harder time sleeping than I was. He had circles under his eyes and a hollow, haunted look on his face. Nightmares? I asked. He nodded, and one hand massaged the back of his neck. Its like when I relax, suddenly Im back there. Gastown. He looked at me, his face so sad. I see them ... theyre hovering over me. He clenched his fists and turned away. They have knives and clubs and... He paused, a choking sound coming from his throat. Sometimes they just have their fists. And Im trapped. He looked back at me, his eyes wide. Not just in the dream. Im there, lying in bed, and I cant move. I cant... I walked up to him and put an arm around him. Im sorry, Diego. Im sure it will pass. In time. Thats what I said, but as soon as it came out, I realized how tepid it sounded. I have no idea of what hes going through. And while my specialty is biology, I know how much psychology can affect it. Its fine, he said, pulling away from me. His face settled into a stony mask. I wanted to reach out to him, tell him it would be okay, but I was already feeling like a fraud. This was a disease I knew very little about. What are you doing up? he asked, shifting the focus on me. I hesitated. He had his own problems, but ... I dont know. I told myself he might enjoy the distraction of someone elses problems. But maybe I was just being selfish? I needed to talk to someone and he had offered? So I told him about what was haunting me. I need to get my people back, I said. And as soon as I can. He nodded, enthusiastically. I wonder if he could relate to them being imprisoned there. Tell me about Lewis, I said. What about him? What are he and his party trying to accomplish? Diego shrugged. Hes been leader of the minority party for a few years now. Hes tried a few times to put his party on top, but Brana and her folks have been too popular. People here are scared, about our vulnerability, but they want to forget about that. To have a life. Branas hard line gives them the sense that they can. So why was Lewis there to meet us the other day? I get the sense that he is trying for one last push. With the raiders and ... what happened on Gastown. He shrugs. He must sense Branas vulnerability. I just dont know if he can do anything about it. Maybe he just needs a little help, I said. What do you mean? He searched my face, suddenly suspicious. I had to remind myself that this was his home. His people. And here I was trying to manipulate it for my own needs. Maybe Ben had rubbed off on me too much. I shrugged. Brana hasnt been a friend to us. She only reluctantly let us set up on the small island. She hates Ben. Shes been awful to you. Diegos face was impassive. Maybe we appeal to Lewis instead. Diego started pacing. I got the feeling I was making him uncomfortable. Can you set up a meeting for me? Diego narrowed his eyes. Im not on the inside anymore. He shook his head. They dont listen to me like they used to. I walked up to him. Damn it, Im ashamed of it, but I walked up to him and I put my hand on his shoulder, reaching up to him. Please, I said. You must still have contacts. Can you reach out to him? He looked down at me, meeting my eyes. The sun was just coming up and I remember him seeming enormous. And steadfast. And I remember thinking that he was meant for another world. An older world. I think so. Then do it, I said. He didnt ask me why or to explain, which I was grateful for. I was tired of talking. I needed to do something. Instead I just leaned up against him and together we watched the sun rise.  Diego set up the meeting at a place called the Frothy Brew. I recalled Ben talking about it in the past. I think maybe raving about it is more accurate. He always got a little ridiculous when it came to beer. Me, Id prefer another whiskey or Maliks wine, but I ordered a light ale and chose a table. Lewis found me soon afterward, settling into a chair opposite me, a dark ale in hand. Diego said you wanted to talk. He sipped at his beer like it was a practiced motion. I was hoping you could help me, I said. He didnt respond. Instead he took a long draught of his ale. There are some scientist friends of mine, former colleagues, and theyre being held in a prison camp run by people out of Gastown. Im sorry, Lewis said. So am I, I said, meeting his eyes. Which is why I want to get them out. Lewis steepled his hands together, drew them close to his mouth, the fingertips touching his lips. Then he said, I dont think thats going to be possible. A hot, fiery anger kindled in the pit of my stomach. I capped it, but I still felt it pushing through. I get it, I said. Theyre nothing to you, except maybe a risk. But ... what if they could offer you something? Lewis flagged down a server for another drink and said, What do you mean? I mean that Im one of three people working right now on studying the virus. Imagine if there were three times as many. Go on... You know what a jigsaw puzzle is? I asked. He nodded. Imagine the picture of the Maenad virus is like a jigsaw puzzle. And like most jigsaw puzzles any of us have seen, its missing a lot of pieces. The pieces we have give us a fraction of the picture, but theres still so many missing that we cant get the whole thing. Okay. The data I took from Gastown helps fill in more of the pieces. Only there are only three of us to see how they fit together. If I could get more people, if we could all work on filling in the puzzle, we could definitely make some progress. He pushed his empty cup away and leaned in. Tell me exactly what you mean. There was my opportunity. To lay it out. To make my case. I inhaled, held it for a moment, then exhaled. Based on the data, and some calculations Ive made, I think I can make a virus-detection kit. He frowned. How would that work? It would be a simple blood test, I said. Wed need specialized equipment, of course, but once we do that, once we can identify the virus, it should be an easy thing to do it on a regular basis. Lewis pulled his cup back to him and curled his hands around it. How long would it take? The blood test? I shrugged. Maybe an hour at most? And this would be reliable? How would you make sure it works? We would do rigorous testing, of course. Testing on clean subjects as well as infected ones. Ferals. Yes. Alpha, our Feral test subject, would be ideal. But we would want to do field tests. On living Ferals. Yes, I said. Though anything along those lines would be done off of Tamoanchan, of course. Alpha is on a nearby island. We might test on the mainland as well. The waitress returned with another dark ale and set it down in front of Lewis. He sipped at it absentmindedly. As you can see, I said, it would eliminate the need for quarantine. At most you would need to hold people for the time it took to run the test. And that means a quicker turnaround for supply runs and, most importantly, safety. If someone did arrive infected, you could identify him almost immediately and take immediate action. Lewis nodded, then took a swig of his beer. Isnt this what you already agreed to do for Brana? Yes, I said, expecting that. Ben and I had made our bed with Brana on our previous visit, but it became clear on us returning that she wouldnt support us. So I reformulatedreformed the equation. Our agreement was that I would research along these lines. But thats not really important. Not in your world. Oh no? No. I dont care anything for politics; Ive never been interested in restarting civilization or analyzing the best forms in which to do so. But I know how to lead people. Anyone who works with scientists realizes that its maybe the hardest way to lead. I know that a group of people, all with genius-level intellects, all wanting to head off in their own directions, is maybe the hardest group to corral. But thats what Ive been doing. And thats what I know. So I told him. It doesnt matter how the test works or whom I originally talked to about it. It matters who announces it. Who brings it to the people. If we do this, and I appear with you to talk about it, people will link this to you. This could be a big win for your side. Lewis leaned back, his face thoughtful. You need an edge over Brana, I said. Youre racing her, but you keep coming up behind. This can put you ahead. He tapped the rim of his cup. You have a choice, I continued. You can keep playing it safe or try for something bigger. Something grander. You want to lead your people, you dont do that with backroom deals and power plays. You get up in front of them and you spin them a vision of the future. You draw them a pictureTamoanchan, five years from now. A paradise. A city unlike any since before the outbreak . A city free of the virus. Free from fear of the virus. He stared at me, his eyes slightly glassy. And what is it that you need to make this happen? More hands, I said. Sergei, Clay, and I can do a lot, but I need people to help with the analysis. I need people to verify and duplicate my work. And I need people to question me. Well need to gather supplies. And well need to run tests. That will take time, but it will be quicker with more people. And these people need to be brought here. We need to be in the same place, I said. We work as a team. And theyre being held in a prison camp? he asked, sipping at his beer. I nodded. I dont know how many. But if we can get them out, and back here, then well not only be saving them, we may be saving everyone on Tamoanchan. So you need me to authorize the resources to get them. Think of it as an investment. In the future. He shook his head. What makes you think Id be able to back something like that? I have to operate within the Council, and Im telling you that Ill be voted down by Branas party. Theyll delay a vote until its a moot point. Youre an outsideryou dont know how the Council operates. Its not designed for efficiency. And theres no other option? Is there any way you can put her on the defensive? Have her party have to catch up? His cup paused halfway to his mouth, then he put it down on the table. I recognized that lookinspiration. There is an emergency order, he said. Whats that? He leaned forward, suddenly energized. Were allowed to authorize measures without getting Council approval if doing so is vital to the safety and security of Tamoanchan. Theyll likely fight me on that, but by the time they do, itll be too late. He slammed his hand down on the wooden table. It was just about then that I sympathized with Ben. Specifically how he convinced Diego to take him to Gastown. He wanted the Cherub so badly that he hammered at Diego until he acquiesced. I want my people back so badly that I did the same to Lewis. This is an enormous risk for me, Lewis said. So we have to set some parameters. Like what? Ill need something tangible. And soon. I nodded Youll get it. Ive been studying Maenad since I was a child. My mother and father studied it before me, and with the data that I recovered and my friends ... we can do this. Weve been waiting for a breakthrough like this. The other steps are in place. Now we can cross the gaps. He chewed on this for a little while. Ill need to assume full oversight of your research. What does that mean? I asked. It means that for my help and my risk, I will conduct periodic visits for progress and safety. It means that ultimately you report to me. If I do this, your project becomes my project, and I intend to make sure it comes to fruition. That was the hardest pill to swallow, to be honest. Im used to running my own projects. I knew Id need to enlist someone else, but to give up control ... that didnt, no, that doesnt sit well with me. Who was Lewis, anyway? Just a politician. With an agenda. I almost said no. But then I thought of my people, in a prison camp. Trapped, tortured, and abandoned. This could be my only shot to help them. To bring them back home. I cant have you interfering in my work, I said. My work, Lewis said. If we do this, its my work. For my friends, I thought. It isnt about meits about them. And all the people we might help. You stay out of the science, I said. He shrugged. Thats not really my thing. Youre in charge when it comes to that. Everything else, though, goes through me. I leaned back. I thought about how I used to have all my people together, and a safe place to study. I thought about how long I had been in charge. Then I thought about how it all had come crashing down, so quickly. I remembered the lives that were lost in the process. I looked Lewis in the eyes. Okay. I agree. Lewis nodded slowly. He drummed his fingers across the table top. I do, too. Thank God, I thought. Then lets get to planning, I said.         FOURTEEN They put the Dumah at the western edge of the island where theyve set up yet another airfield. Its smart thinking. With the risk of attack still looming, theyre setting up multiple places to get ships off the ground. Multiple areas for evacuation. Multiple targets for enemy ships. Shes a strange-looking ship, I think, as we approach, now that I can see her up close in daylight. Shes not like anything Ive seen before. Flatter than most ships, and with that matte coating to the envelope. But she looks sleek. Not as sleek as the Cherub, but sleek nonetheless. Shes being topped up as we approach, the hoses feeding her hydrogen to get her ballonets nice and plump. Guards stop us before we get to the airfield proper. We have orders to keep him out, a grey and grizzled man says, indicating me. My reputation has traveled, I say. Lewis waves a hand. Ive canceled them, he says. He holds up a piece of paper. Can you read? The guard shakes his head. Then youre going to have to take my word. You know who I am. I have a signed declaration here from the Council. An order saying this ship is to be released at once and given over to this man. The guard doesnt look happy, but he takes the paper. He cant read the writing, but he obviously recognizes the seal thats on the paper. And he steps aside. Which is a relief but makes me wonder how easy it would be to stage a coup on Tamoanchan. I know that Lewis is taking a risk, but hes taking it for his own benefit. Im also aware of how this whole thing could blow up in our faces. Lewis turns to me. You sure you know what youre doing? Thats funny, I say. I was going to ask you the same thing. Lewis turns to look at my copilot. Diego still looks beat up, but hes here. And I still dont know if thats a good thing or a bad one. It was his idea. As we were laying out the plan, three things became apparent(1) the Dumah made a great dirigible to use, as she could get close without being seen and we could use her cameras to help spy out what was going on, but (2) she didnt have enough cargo capacity or space in the gondola to take on the number of people we were talking about. So that meant another ship. A passenger or freight one. Diego immediately suggested the Osprey. But (3) I needed a copilot. I couldnt run everything myself on the Dumah. Of course Lewiss plan meant that we couldnt really appropriate any ship captains or ships from the islandthat could be made to look like they were weakening the islands defensesso that left me and Diego, seeing as hed been relieved of his duties. Miranda of course wanted to come with me, but Lewis crushed that idea. I need you here working on the virus, he said. Getting things ready for the others if Ben is successful. That if seemed to make her flinch. I knew she was angry, but the fact was I had to agree with Lewis. Her place was on the island, working on her cure. It wasnt that I didnt want her with meof course I didbut she was most valuable doing what she did best. And I could get along better in a fight without having to worry about her. Still, things feel strange with her. We spent the last night in front of the stove again, but things were different. We kissed and touched but ... she felt distant. I hope that shes just worried about the boffins. As we lay there, next to one another, shoulder to shoulder, Miranda asked me, Ben, why didnt you ever tell me your middle name? I sighed. I was hoping you would forget that. You know me better than that. She looked at me, all concern for a moment. Its not ... Cherub, is it? I gave her my most wounded expression. Its still too soon for those kinds of comments. She placed a hand over her heart. I am terribly sorry. So ... middle name? I shrug. I never ... the way my father told it is that my mother picked it. Miranda was silent. I rarely talked about my mother. She chose it. And I didnt really have anything left from her. So ... I guess I grew up thinking it was something special. And secret. Unconsciously I reached up to my chest, where I used to wear my dads Star of David. That star was gone, but Id gotten a replacement, the one currently pinned to my coat. I suppose you want to know what it is. No. No? I mean yes. I do. But not now. I looked at her, all questions. She placed a hand on the side of my face. Come back to me with all my people, and then you can tell me, okay? I nodded. Okay. Then I pulled her to me and held her in my arms until we both fell asleep. But I woke up alone again. Ben? I snap back to Lewis, only just realizing that I had been lost in my thoughts. Yeah. You ready? I nod. Lewis stares me down. Dont fuck this up. Ill get them back, I say. But not for you. Lewis turns to Diego as if appealing to him for help, but Diego just pulls me toward the Dumah. Thats the ship you stole? he asks. Sure is. Diego whistles. That old friend of yours must be out of his mind with anger. I smile. Yeah, I say, and I feel a twinge of something. More conflicted feelings. I know Mal was ready to kill me, but once more I had a part in that. Ben Gold, always fouling the water. Technically, Miranda stole it, I add. Oh, well thats all right then. We board the Dumah and I briefly show Diego the layout of the controls, covering both the flight controls and the controls that deal with the bank of monitors. Then I settle into the pilots seat and start up all the engines and rotors. A hum goes through the ship, and I feel a slight vibration. A purr, almost. Everything looks good, so I release the anchor and let us rise. Shes quiet, Diego says. Sure is, I say. Thats one of the reasons I wanted her. Diego lays out the set of maps we brought with us. Using the information from Tess, weve managed to trace our route east, though well need to check out the landmarks when we get to the right place. I push the engines to full, turning us back toward the mainland. Even with full power it will probably take us a few hours. Enough time to chat with Diego about why hes really there. You didnt need to come, I say. Yes I did. You said that you needed someone else to fly this thing. I know. But it didnt have to be you. You trying to prove something? No. He shakes his head and turns back to the monitors, examining the controls. I wanted to help. And I needed to do something. Ive been stuck in that house for too many days. I turn the chair to him and cross my arms. And this has nothing to do with you showing everyone that you can still do this? That Gastown didnt damage you that bad? His expression darkens and he sets his jaw. I realize I might be entering dangerous territory. He places both hands on the console. I think youre the one with something to prove, he says. What does that mean? Remember, Ben, Rosie and I were the ones who told you about the Gastown raiders coming for Mirandas people. I saw you light out of there, desperate to save your friends. Only you didnt. A wave, cold and angry, rises through me. I did what I could to fight the raiders. I was outnumbered and outgunned. Do you really think that? he asks. That you did everything you could? I become conscious of my heart beating hard in my chest, and I stand up from my chair. Are you trying to imply something? He meets my eyes, his face expressionless. Ben, I dont need to imply anything. Are you telling me you dont feel guilty about that? And of course as he brings it up, I do feel it resurface, that feeling that maybe I could have done more, could have tried more. The fear that maybe the old survival instinct got the better of me. And yet... I think you have me beat on the guilty-feelings front, I say. What? Youre practically wearing a sign around your neck that says, I broke. His eyes get wide. You werent there. You dont know That they tortured you? That they took you apart? It was pretty obvious. Ben... Fine. They broke you. They would have broken any of us. Me, you, Brana, Rosie Ben! He slaps both hands down on the console, and the sound reverberates around us. His neck is rigid, the tendons visible. I freeze. He closes his eyes. When he speaks his voice is tight. Its not that I broke. Youre right. Anyone wouldve. Its that I got caught in the first place. He shakes his head, then rubs a hand over his head. I asked too many questions, or maybe I asked the wrong questions, or Diego, I say. Jesus. Thats what youre upset about? He levels me with a stare that practically staggers me. I shake my head. Who knows what tipped them off? Maybe they were on alert because of what we did with Miranda and the lab. Maybe they just got lucky. You saw how it was up there. A bunch of psychotic, bloodthirsty madmen with a bunch of cruel, insanely intelligent scientists behind them. We were all outclassed. He looks down. The moment sits like that for a minute or so. Then I say, I think the ultimate moral of this tale is that next time you and I should stick together and Miranda can stay with Rosie. Rosies certainly not going to stick with you, he says, the hint of a smile on his face. I shake my head. Diego, your sister scares me. He nods again. I know. I laugh. I cant help myself. He shrugs. Youll work it out. Youll have to. Really? I ask. He shrugs again. Youll either work it out, or... Or what? Or shell probably end up kicking your ass. I resolve to myself to try to work it out.  When Tess had told me about a prison camp, I hadnt imagined an actual camp. I thought they might take shelter in a school or an old office building. Someplace where they would have hard walls between them and Ferals. Someplace where they would have a roof, or multiple roofs, between them and the air. I figured they took scientists for a reason and that theyd have to do experiments or analyze data or something. A school would seem ideal. But no, the Cabal for whatever reason has created an actual camp. Not for the first time, I find I cant fathom what theyre doing or why. Below us, as shown on the monitors, is a series of tents and other temporary structures. A thick-wire fence surrounds these, topped with barbed wire. Mostly good against Ferals, but not completely safe. Ive seen Ferals climb, and Ive seen some shrug off serious wounds when in the grips of hunger. Thats why theyve constructed another fence on the inside, with a series of spikes or sharpened poles or whatever inside that ring. If a Feral manages to climb over the outer fence, hes going to have a hard time getting through that inner layer. And Im sure there are traps as well. A couple of gates allow access inside and out. Id guess a guard is stationed in front of it at all times, but I cant really make one out at this resolution. Im amazed at how open it is, I say to Diego. Hes bent over the screens, taking it all in. The sun is setting and we have only a few moments to get a clear look at the structure. Lucky for us, he says. Yeah. I shake my head. Maybe its a cut-and-run operation, he says. Theyre not valuable enough. If something goes wrong, they get out and leave your friends on their own. Maybe, I say. The boffins are fairly capable people, but a group of them on their own in the open would make easy targets for anyone. I make a quick sketch of the layout on the edge of one of the maps so I can remember. I look out the gondola and see the last of the suns orange glow slip beneath the horizon. Okay, I say. Hit that switch. Diego does, and the infrared monitor springs to life. This is why I insisted we take the Dumah in addition to the Osprey. Weve seen the structure, now we need to see whos inside it. Outlined on the screen are the red, yellow, and green glowing blobs of the heat down below us. The people are easy to see, thin slashes of color. Larger blobs appear to be fires. Good God, Diego says. This is incredible. I know, I say. Perhaps the most impressive of the Dumahs many eyes. As expected, in front of the gate is a guard, and what I take to be several others move around inside the fence. I mark them as guards because of their movements, within a certain area, back and forth. Stopping here and there. By far, though, the majority of the heat blobs are scattered among where Id seen several of the tents earlier. As we watch, one blob moves to each of the tents, and then all the blobs inside move out into the center of the compound, line up into two orderly lines, then move into the largest tent, where they all settle into their own spaces and stay there. Makes sense, I say. Its dark. They probably want to preserve whatever energy they have. Solar, Id guess. Maybe feeding time, Diego says. I nod. Obviously the boffins are valuable enough to feed. Its generally accepted that the three most valuable resources are food, fuel or power, and ammunition. The boffins have to be worth something for the Cabal to spend so much food on them on a regular basis. It maybe explains why they are where they are and this place seems lightly guarded. Theyre already expending enough resources on them. They cant spare more. You get a count? I ask. Thirteen, I think. Inside the big tent. And the guards? He looks up at me. Four. Four? I look down, and it looks like hes right. All the guards I had spotted before, patrolling, and that was it. Id expected more. Of both, sadly. Wed lost more boffins than that at the Core. But its better than nothing. Id assumed wed taken casualties. The raiders who took the place werent gentle. And the Ferals theyd dropped inside must have done some damage. Four, I repeat. I nod to myself. We can do that. I know, Diego says. The trick is going to be getting in. Theres no roof, I say. Yeah, but what are we going to do, lower the ship right down on top of them? I smile. Why not? What if they start shooting the prisoners? My smile fades. What do you suggest? Drop me down outside the fence. I can take out the guard at the front. It should create enough of a distraction that you can get in at this corner. He points to my map. If I can take one out and attract anothers attention, that will leave two for you. No. I slam one hand down on the console. No way. Youll be an easy dinner for any Ferals that happen to be around. No cover. No place to run. Not to mention that your arm is still healing. How are you going to fire a gun? Im a good shot with one hand. I can do this. He points to the screen. There are no places for nests nearby. We looked. And there are no other heat traces. And the minute you start shooting, any Feral within hearing distance is going to come sniffing around. Well be out by then. Jesus, Diego. I sigh. Then Ill be the distraction and you go in. He shakes his head. I dont know the scientists. Youre going to have to do it. Damn it, Diego. Ben, he says. His eyes bore into mine. And Im thinking, Dont say it. Just dont... You owe me this. He said it. Im aware of how ridiculous this is. I put him into harms way before, and now hes asking me to make it up to him by doing it again. I look back at the infrared monitor and the bright figures there. People I couldnt save before. Fine. Do it, is what I hear myself say. My insides clench up a bit, but its like Ive already flipped the switch to Go, and I start positioning the Dumah to lower Diego to the ground. Im going to have to put you down at a distance, I say. Cant risk them seeing us. You going to be able to move okay? Ive been exercising a lot, Ben. I may be in better shape than I was before we went to Gastown. Like hell, I think. I grab his hand, which is now covered with a worn leather glove. Dont make me regret this. I lower him down on the side opposite the gate. It will mean more walking for him but less chance of us being seen. Were dark and quiet, but we still block out the stars. Luckily for us, theres enough cloud cover tonight to help hide us. Diego hits the ground, and I start moving to the edge of the compound. I flick on the radio and grab the transmitter. Rosie, I say. After a moment she comes back to me. Yeah. Start moving in. Come in from the north. I want their attention focused there. Wheres Diego? she asks. My stomach tightens again. Hes busy right now. Just count off five minutes then move in. Okay, she says. I huff out a breath, then flip the radio off. Then prepare to lower the Dumah so that I can go down to my least-favorite place in the world. The ground.  My first thought as my boots touch ground is that it smells like shit. Literally. There must be a latrine or something nearby. Figuresyou have to put it somewhere. Im glad my mouth is covered with my scarf. My next thought is how comfortable and normal it feels to be covered from head to toe with clothes. Which makes me sad about how paranoid I am about infection. It also makes me think of Miranda and the two of us naked, and so my next thought is that I need to focus on the task at hand. I hear gunshots and hope that means Diego is taking out the guards. At the very least it should mean that Diego is still alive. Unless some Ferals have got him and thats what theyre shooting at. Focus, Ben. I have the revolver out and Im crouching, moving steadily but not too fast. The first tent is empty. I see a bunch of simple tables inside with stuff on top of them. Its too dark to make them out too well. I find myself wishing for the ability to see in infrared, but of course thats just ridiculous. But it would be really cool. The next tent resembles the one I just passed, and the next. I dont see anyone, though I check each one quickly. Its dark. Really dark. The clouds that helped to hide the Dumah are also hiding the moon, and the starlight only does so much. There are fires, though. I can see them off in the direction of the gate. That helps give me my bearings to find the big tent. I start moving and hear a yell in the distance, but I cant tell if its from pain or triumph. It makes me freeze for just a second, and thats when someone tackles me and I fall to the ground on my back, the air in my lungs squeezed out by the weight on top of me. He pins my gun arm to the side, pressing hard. Hes bigger than me, stronger. Heavier. Correctionshe. I look up into a womans face, bandana or scarf tied bandit-style across it. A nose broke in several places. One eye scarred at the edges. The face zooms toward me and then disappears in a blast of pain as her skull connects with mine. Then her fist hits me hard in the side. I reel from the pain and my hand, now freed, wants to fly up to my ringing skull, but instead I send it up to hers. Not the mouth, I think. The eyes. Her free hand reaches up to grab at mine, and I know shes stronger. And her legs on top of me are squeezing, and Im still struggling to get enough breath in me. My right hand, with the revolver in it, is already numb. But I keep clawing for her eye. She starts forcing my hand away and I try to keep it there, but I cant. Shes stronger and Im getting weaker, but as my hand slips away I manage to grab the bottom part of her nose with my gloved fingers. I give it a hard jerk, and for a moment her head moves and I feel her weight shift and, tensing my whole body, I push myself to that side, and she slips a bit off of me. I manage to get a fist into the side of her face as I inhale and I slam the same fist on her ear and then into her throat. The bandana isnt too thick, and so I hammer her again and again. She falls back for a moment, trying to suck in breath herself, and her hand comes off of my revolver hand. Its weak, but I bring up my numb hand only to realize Ive lost my grip on the revolver. She hits me hard in the face, and I feel the warm wetness of blood somewhere. I raise my free hand and shift to one side so that the second blow gets me between my chin and chest. It hurts but not as much. I aim my revolver hand for her throat again but she catches it, so I go for her eyes again with my left hand, and this time my fingers find it. She roars in pain. I manage to roll her off of me, punching and kicking at her where I can. I see the revolver, lying on the ground, and I scramble for it. She scrambles after me. With a hurt eye and an injured throat, she keeps after me, punching me in the stomach, in the chest, then in the groin, so close to where it would have curled me into pain. Then my fingers curl around the grip of the revolver, I swing it around, and my finger finds the trigger. Boom. The shot is hasty and aimed poorly, but its so close. It takes her in the space between her shoulder and neck, and the flesh there is suddenly wet meat. I push her back and scramble away as the blood sprays, blood that may be infected. I have no way of knowing. My ears are ringing and pain is leaping through my body from injury to injury, but Im alive. I get to my feet and move toward the tent, this time keeping a firm grip on the revolver. Any hope of surprise is gone. When I get to the tent, standing in the entrance is another guard, dressed in furs and leathers. He holds a large automatic to the head of one of the boffins, a man I recognize. His names Anders. For a quick flash I feel a wash of relief, relief that its true. That the boffins, our boffins, are here. Then fear as I realize that I might lose one of them. Then anger at the animal holding the gun to Anderss head. I quickly wrangle the anger under control. Drop your gun, the guard says. And I know I should. But I dont. If he shoots Anders, he has nothing. Ill shoot him easily. And he has to know that. But then again, he looks like hes from Valhalla and I dont know how much reason goes into their decisions. Im fighting with myselfmake a decision, Benand I decide to lower the gun. I dont want to take any chances with the boffins lives. The guards eyes are on mine, and mine on his. I will my hand to lower. It doesnt immediately move, so I will it harder. Then, before I actually move, the guards hand falters. I dont know whether he suddenly thinks that maybe the boffins arent important to me, or maybe he realizes the position hes in, but his hand moves for a moment and one of the boffins slams something into the side of the guards head. At the same time, Anders wriggles free, and as the opening appears, I drop to ground and shoot up at the guard. The hammer comes down, noise fills the air, and my shot hits the raider in the head, blowing his brains out against the back of the tent. I get to my feet and cross the distance to the tent. Inside I see many familiar facesdirty and stained, thin and bedraggledbut people I know. Is everyone okay? I ask. Several people say yes; there are a lot of nods. I notice they had almost all dropped to the ground. Smart. Physics is something they understand, the trajectory of the bullet. And they know, possibly more than anyone, how the virus spreads. That had been my fear, that even if they stayed out of the way of the bullet, that someone would get splattered with blood. Because who knows if that guard was clean. Stay here for a moment, I say, then move off toward the gate. I see two dead guards there. Diego? I call out. Im here, he calls back. Get that door open. I exhale heavily in relief and then move toward the gates, opening the first and then the second. Diego comes in, breathing hard. Did they get you? I ask. No, he says. He smiles. I told you I could do it. Yeah, well lets not do it again. As we move back toward the large tent, the bulk of the Osprey appears overhead. Time to get Mirandas people home, I say.         FIFTEEN I fly back to Tamoanchan alone. Rosie insists on Diego coming back with her. To help with the boffins, she says. She suddenly has thirteen additional people on board and she has to fly the ship. Only eleven of the prisoners are Mirandas people, though. That leaves nine of her colleagues unaccounted for. The other two boffins we rescued were apparently taken from a different facility east of the Rockies. Its nice to know there are others out there looking for a cure. For the first time in a long time I feel, well, satisfied. We managed to rescue the boffins without any casualties. Diego ended up okay. Were headed back to Tamoanchan, where Miranda and her reunited friends will work on a cure and at the very least are likely to come up with a detection system for the virus. Sure, Valhalla and the Cabal are still out there, but we have a place to go. And for the first time in a while, we have hope. Im still feeling that lightness, that sense of buoyancy, as I hit the ground on Tamoanchanand Im even smiling when Rosie strides up to me and punches me in the mouth. I hit the ground, my head still spinning as she stands over me. Get up, she says. Go on, get up. What the fuck, Rosie, I manage to say. Blood smears across my hand as I wipe my face. You let my brother down on the ground without backup? Out in the open? Hes injured, you dogfucker. Get up! It was his idea, I say, though now it sounds a little weak to me. I dont get up, though. Because if I do either shes going to knock me back down to the ground or Im going to have to fight her, and neither of those options appeal to me. Get. Up. Now. No. If you want to hit me again, you have to do it while Im on the ground. Dont think I wont. Rosie! Its Diego, running up and pulling her back. What the fuck is wrong with you? Leave me alone, she says, slipping free of his good arm. This is between me and Ben. He stares at her. It was my decision. She grimaces and shakes her head. If you have an issue with that, take it up with me. She leans forward, putting her face right up in his. Youre both fucking idiots. She shakes her head again. You should know better. But by all means, if you want to die or worse, keep hanging around with Ben. Youll get each other killed. Im sure. Rosie... She shrugs off his questing hand. No. Just ... leave me alone. She points at me. This isnt over. Stay clear of me or else this is back on. I nod. After she walks away, Diego helps me to my feet. She really doesnt like me, I say. To be fair, Diego says. Not many people do. I wipe my lip and dust myself off. Too much blood lately. Id had Diego check me over back at the prison camp to make sure I didnt get any of the one guards blood on me. Looked like it only got on my clothes. Which I need to wash right away. Thing is, were not on Tamoanchan proper. That wasnt the agreement with Lewis. We were bringing back the boffins, and there were too many for the quarantine cells, so we came straight to the island that they set aside for Mirandas research. What theyve taken to calling the Orchard. Its not very bigmostly a hilltop with some trees, some sandy, rocky ground nearby. Room enough for us but little else. The bright spot is that we can do our quarantine here and not have to worry about sweating it out in some cell somewhere. Of course theyre corralling us. Were in a fenced-off area with several hastily-erected tents. On the ground again. I cant help feeling apprehensive as the Dumah and the Osprey move away, piloted by two peacekeepers from the big island. Im starting to feel like this is what the rest of my life is going to bean endless series of quarantines with the occasional interruption. I stick close to Diego while trying to steer clear of Rosie. This is easier than I think since she doesnt seem to want anything to do with either of us. I wish we had something to drink, I say. Diego pulls open his black jacket and removes a tarnished metal flask. That whiskey we had back at my place. You sneaky bastard. He smiles. What are you going to drink? Emphasis on the bastard. He shrugs and his smile widens. He reaches into another pocket and pulls out a pack of playing cards, holding it out in an invitation. Now, Ive played Diego in cards beforehes good. Too good. But theres not a lot else to do. I shrug. Ill play you for a pull of that flask. What are you going to bet? A drink at the Frothy Brew, I say. As soon as we get out of here and back to the main island. And if you dont make it out of quarantine? I flash him a wounded look. Then Miranda will cover it. He shakes his head. Ben, you are such a hustler. Are we going to play or not? He shakes his head again, but then pulls the cards out and starts to shuffle. Lets just say that when he gives me a sip, its because he feels sorry for me. Damn, Diegos good at cards.  Miranda finds me as I move up the hill after my release from quarantine. She runs to me and wraps her arms around me. Tight. And I feel this rush of warmth in my chest. I hadnt realized how much Id been looking forward to seeing her. Thank you for bringing my people back to me. I flash her a smile. I have to use my boffin-wrangling skills somehow. Her face gets serious. You did good. As I feel my face flush, her eyes scan my face. Seems you didnt escape unscathed. I wince. I ran into one of the guards. She got in a few good shots. She reaches out, touching my lip. This ones opened. I flinch from her touch, my naked blood, but of course I just went through quarantine. That ... was Rosie. Rosie? I wince and rub a hand across the back of my head. To get the boffins out we needed a distraction. Diego was that distraction, but it meant dangling him out in the open. What? He wanted to go. He said he needed to go. She shakes her head. And you went along with that? I shrug. He ... convinced me. I wanted him to be able to prove himself. She continues to shake her head. Ben... It worked out okay. We got the boffins back. She meets my eyes. And if you hadnt? If Diego had ended up shot, or worse? It didnt happen. But it could have. I know, I say. It was a risk. I made a call. We got your people out. She looks away from me. The moment stretches into silence. I need to go see them, she says at last. Yeah, I say. Why dont you go see Sergei, she says, still looking away. He was asking about you. I nod and move up the hill as she moves down. Sergei is one of Mirandas closest friends. Hell, hes more of a father to hertook over after her father died, back when she was in her teens. Theyve been searching for a cure together. Hes a good guy, Sergei is. A little stiff, but good. I head to the makeshift lab that they assembled. Truth is, I havent seen Sergei, or Clay, another of Mirandas scientists, since we first came to Tamoanchan. Clay is a little shit I couldnt care less about, but Im looking forward to seeing Sergei. Hes not like a father to me, only my actual father was ever that, but the way I feel about him is the way I imagine someone might feel about an uncle. Not that I had one or ever really knew one, but its what I imagine. I cant resist cracking a grin as he looks up from his pile of papers and smiles at me. Ben! he calls. Then hes walking over to me and clapping me in an awkward but heartfelt hug. Hes still wearing that strange nautical hat he always wears, white with an anchor on the front. I notice that he looks older. His beard and hair were always grey, but the lines in his face seem deeper, especially those around his mouth. You made it back, he says. I did. I told you I would. You did, he says. And you brought Miranda with you. Thank you. Dont thank me, I say. She kept me alive. Hell, she stole our ride back here. I dont even think she needs me anymore. I dont think she needs any of us, he says. He smiles. Maybe I should give up science, take up farming instead. I raise my eyebrows. I dont know that Miranda will let that happen. But maybe I can help you set up a secret garden somewhere. He laughs. You? I laugh back. Good point. He smiles. I think well be too busy with Mirandas virus-detection project. Yeah, I say. I figured youd be all hands on that. Clay appears from a back room, wiping his hands on a cloth. He sees me and gives me the tiniest of nods. Ben. Clay. Manage to blow up any ships today? he asks, not able to resist taking a shot. I know hes doing it to rile me uphe thinks Im slow and stupidand I tell myself to ignore it, but hes talking about my ship. The one I lost. The one I loved. The one I sacrificed so that people like him could I realize that Ive taken a few steps toward him. I force myself to stop. No, I say. I brought you some of your friends back. Sergei looks questioningly at me. Youre out of quarantine... I nod. So they are, too. Sergeis smile is a kilometer wide. Cmon, Clay, he says. Let us go welcome them. Clay glares at me as he leaves but does leave. And then Im alone. This is going to be fun, just me and the boffins, alone on this island. Just like old times. Then I remember that Diego is still here, too, and I go try to find him and see if we can dig up a bottle of booze.  That night, theres a big celebration. Turns out Sergei has been distilling some of his own hooch using the islands crops, and a jug of it has already been passed around several times. Lewis, our new patron, even sent over some extra food for us. Which is a good thing because the boffins are ravenous. Turns out they didnt get fed very well out in that prison camp. Me, Im all for drinking, and for celebrating, especially when theres something to celebrate, but Im also interested in what was going on in the camp. And the more we know about whats going on with Valhalla and the Cabal, the more we can do to prepare for a possible assault. I end up talking to Crazy Osaka as he jams some fish in his mouth and washes it down liberally with some of Sergeis hooch. I remember asking Miranda once how he got his name. I figured he was known for doing, well, crazy things. Miranda explained that it was because he had such outlandish scientific theories. I was disappointed. But thats the boffins. So they had you doing what? Experiments? Mostly reviewing data, he says, his mouth full. Stuff about the virus? He nods. Yeah, mostly. He looks at me, onion hanging out of his mouth. You know what the weird thing is, though? I shake my head. No. The weird thing... He leans in. The weird thing is? It was our data in the first place. What? I think its what they took from Apple Pi. Our notes, our experiments. They were having us deconstruct it for them. Hold on, I say. You were explaining it for those guards? No, he says, screwing his face up. Not them. They had these other people. Trained people. Theyd come to us every few days. In between, we were expected to review what had been assigned to us and prepare notes. Why dump you out in the open like that, though? He shrugs. I have no idea. After they first took us from Apple Pi, they put us in a school. Wed sit in the classrooms all day and work, like we were students, ya know, from before Maenad. But ... I heard one of the guards say that it was too hard to keep a close watch on us there. The story went around that someoneI dont know whohad gotten free and hid away from them. So they moved you somewhere that couldnt happen. He shrugs again. They moved us. Did they... I pause. Did they hurt you? He pauses, mid-chew, and looks down. Sometimes. He shrugs. We tried to figure out how to avoid it. What to say. He looks back up at me. I even made a chart. A chart? Yes, he says. Of what set them off. What led to their punishments, each time it happened. He looks down again. It didnt help. His voice is low and strangled. I reach for another question, something to divert him away from the current topic of conversation. What about the new boffins? I ask. They okay? He shrugs. They seem just fine. We were all in there together. All tormented together. His eyes seem haunted, looking off in the middle distance. Then they snap back and he returns to his food. Yeah, Hector and Maya. They seem smart. I remember both of them from when we rescued them from the prison camp. Hector is tall and thin, with a receding hairline and grey at his temples. Maya is short and slight, with a long, dark ponytail and, oddly, silver hoops in her ears. Large ones. Its not something I see very often. I decide to seek out the new boffins and introduce myself to them. Thank you so much for getting us out, Hector says. You didnt have to. You dont know us. I wasnt going to leave you behind, I say. And the other boffins vouch for you. Boffins? Maya asks. Sorry. Its a word I use for Mirandas people. Miranda, Maya says. We heard a lot about her in the camp. Yeah, I say. Shes like the unofficial leader of this group. Shes the one who brought them all together to work on a cure. You havent met her yet? No, Hector says. She seems busy. Cmon, I say. Let me introduce you. So I bring them over to Miranda, who has been smiling all night. Which causes this swelling and warmth inside my chest. That I could help bring her people back makes me feel good. That it makes her happy makes me feel better. But I still dont know what those feelings meanto her, to me, to anyone. Hi, Ben, Miranda says. Her skin is slightly flushed from the hooch. Miranda, I say, I wanted to introduce you to Hector and Maya. Miranda smiles and puts out her hand. Oh, yes. Ive heard a lot about you. Maya shakes it first, then Hector. Im so glad to meet you. Im happy that Ben was able to get you out. Were grateful to be out, Maya says. We wanted to ask ... I mean ... were not sure what you want to do with us. Do you need us to leave? Do you want to leave? Miranda asks. Actually, Hector says, weve been talking about it and we thought ... I mean if you didnt mind ... we were thinking Wed love to stay if we could, Maya interrupts. Miranda smiles at her. The way I hear it, you two would fit in nicely around here. The smile fades. And were still short some people. Besides, I dont even know if they would let you off the island at this point. Theyre pretty protective about the location. Thats okay with me, Maya says. It looks like you have access to food and shelter. And places to bathe. Mirandas smile returns. That wont be a problem at all. Great, Hector says. The others ... they told us about your work on a cure. Id ... Id like to help. Good, Miranda says. Then its settled. Well start in the morning. Maya and Hector move off, and Miranda looks over to me. Her eyes are shining. Or maybe glassy. Thank you, she says. Thank you for getting them out. I nod. I needed to do it. She puts a hand on my cheek. Then she leans in and kisses me. Its the first time weve done this in front of other people. I kiss her back. As we pull apart, I catch Clay at the other end of the room, scowling at me. Then another boffin comes up to Miranda and she turns to talk to her. Sergei finds me a little while later. It is good, Ben, he says. What is? This, he says. All of this. Our people. Miranda. Im guessing Sergei is a little drunk. Hes staring at Miranda. You know shes like a daughter to me, yes? Of course, I say. And I love her like one. His eyes move to me. Like my own. He smiles, then it fades. I knew her parents. I promised them. He grabs my shoulder, leans in a little too close. I promised them. Leave it to the boffinsall logic while sober, all maudlin while drunk. I look at Sergei and see tears in his eyes. It unnerves me. I turn to go. Sergeis hand claps down hard on my shoulder. Pulls me back around. You, he says. His voice is a little too loud. A little too emphatic. You do a good job of protecting her. I try, I say. And you make her happy. Are you sure? I ask. I am. He pats me again. Ben ... you should ... I mean, you... Sergei... He shakes his head. You shouldnt let this slip away, you hear? Okay, Sergei. No, he says. No. I had someonelong ago. He shakes his head again. I let it just ... slip away. He mimes opening his hands, gives a little smile. Then his face turns serious. I never forgave myself. Dont do that, okay? Okay, I say. Promise me, he says. Sergei, its okay. He places his hand on my cheek. Promise. Me. Fine. I promise. Good, he says, the smile returning. Good. Then he stumbles off. I catch Mirandas eye from across the room. She is happy, smiling. Gorgeous. Shining. Part of me wants to walk across the room, pull her to me, and kiss her. But now doesnt really seem like the time. Still, it feels like a perfect night. Then I catch sight of Rosie glaring at me, too. Well, almost perfect.  The next day, Lewis shows up to meet everyone and get a sense of the operation. Also to establish his authority. Im not really part of either. I want to stay here with Miranda, of course, but theres not much for me to do here. I crave the activity of the main island. And as long as Alpha is here, Ill never feel comfortable. Miranda is busy with the boffins, sharing the new data she stole from the Cabal, giving them their assignments, answering questions. I wander for a bit, walking the edge of the island, and then I find myself back in the boffins area. Theyre going to need new buildings out here, I think. If everyone is going to stay. The newcomers need a place to sleep. Right now theyre all huddled in the largest room in the place. Last night they basically passed out in any space they could. And theyre going to need more room for their experiments. Were going to have to talk to Lewis about a long-term solution. Somehow, as Im wandering, I find myself at Alphas enclosure. Its kept away from the main work area. Hes in a cage in a building with another layer of fencing around. Miranda explained to me their security measures. Even I had to admit they sounded pretty thorough. And they damn well better be. Because theyre keeping a live Feral here. And if he were to escape, well, who knows what might happen? Which is why Tamoanchan has been insisting on everyone staying out here. Heading back to the island would mean another quarantine period before I could do anything. Then, for reasons even Im not sure of, I go inside to look at Alpha, careful to deactivate all the security measures in place, making sure I reactivate them as I pass. This is nothing new to me. My father taught me you dont take chances with Ferals, and Im proud to say I never have. Well, except letting this one fly with me. But that was Mirandas idea and it wasnt my ship, so I didnt have a whole lot of say in the matter. Alpha looks a lot like the last time I saw him. His hair is still long and tangled, but he looks a little cleaner. I wonder if that was the boffins. Taking blood samples might be a lot easier without a layer of dirt and shit and matted hair. Miranda has access to some tranquilizers. and theyve rigged a system where they can easily administer injections if necessary. They might have knocked him out and scrubbed him down. The idea almost makes me vomit. Too easy for his contaminated fluids to get on someone that way unless you were covered head to toe. Ill have to ask Miranda. But hes pacing when I walk in, until he sees me and launches himself at the bars of his cage, shrieking, challenging. If he could, hed be on top of me in an instant, his teeth on my neck or some other place where they might be able to kill. Hed let me die and then tear into me with hands that might have once held a spoon or fork, with a mouth that might have once been capable of speech. No longer. Once again, I feel the urge to pull out the revolver and splatter his brains on the other side of his cage. But I dont. I promised Miranda I wouldnt. But I keep hoping for a reason that we dont need to keep this thing. A reason to dispose of him, drop him in the ocean and let the creatures there rid the world of his threat forever. But not today. I double-check the security as I leave. Okay, triple-check it. I mean, fucking Ferals. When I get back to the lab, Miranda is waiting for me. You okay? she asks. I nod. Yeah. Fine. She looks at me, doubtful. Im fine. She shrugs. Okay. What did Lewis want? What doesnt he want? she says. I had to give him a breakdown of what were planning. What we need. What were going to do with it all. Was he satisfied? She tucks some loose hair behind her ear. I dont know. I think so. But we need a lot. We have the mind power now, but we need supplies. Glassware, chemicals, hardware ... . more. Lewis ... I dont know that he liked all of that. I nod. Hes going to need to organize ship captains to go forage, give them lists, teach them what to look for. I guess, she says. Up until now, this plan of Mirandas has seemed nebulousboffin stuff, science, nothing to do with mebut right here I see a piece of the puzzle that makes sense to me. Let me do it. What? I feel something, a slight burning in my belly, a fire rekindled. Let me go deal with it. Ill talk to Lewis. Help arrange the ships. Help get you your supplies. She looks up at me, unsure. This is what Im good at, Miranda, I say. I fly ships. I forage. I dont know all of what you need, but I can figure out a way to get it. Ben Its what Im good at, I repeat. Along with pissing people off, getting thrown in cells, getting beat on... She ticks them off on her fingers. Im a decent pilot, too. She sighs. I know. She crosses her arms. Its not a bad idea. Then why not let me do that? She meets my eyes. I thought that you were going to stick around this time. I look away. I cant do anything for you here. In her eyes, a challenge. I keep talking. I know ships. I know captains. I know foraging. Can you really trust anyone else? She sighs again. No. Okay, then. Ill do it. Ill go to the main island and talk to Lewis and start finding ship captains. What are you going to fly, Ben? I shrug. I dont know. Maybe Ill fly with someone else. Maybe Ill convince Diego to take the Osprey. And Rosie? I dont know, Miranda. I need to figure it out. Okay. Okay? Yes, she says. Youre really the only person I would trust. And Im the best person for the job. She just shakes her head. Go on. Say it. Say Im the best person for the job. Sometimes it surprises me that youve survived this long. I smile at her. This will work. Ill need to give you a list of what we need. Yes, I say. Please do. I can figure out some of it, but not the ... science stuff. Miranda shakes her head. Ill take care of the science stuff. She pushes a strand of hair out of her face. I dont expect that Lewis will like this much, but ... hes in this up to his ears. He lives or dies with us, and for us to live, we need everything. Im polling my people to see if they know of any caches or intact research locations. Well need to get as much as we can. Whatever you need, I say. She tilts her head at me. You kinda like all this jumping around, dont you? Youve never been in one place for very long. I open my mouth. The Cherub doesnt count, she interrupts. Then no. She chews on her bottom lip. Do you think you could ever get used to this island living? I inhale slowly and consider my next words. Its been something Ive been thinking about for a little while now. I guess ever since the Cherub blew up. Will I ever be happy in one place? Will I ever be happy on the ground? I dont know, I say. I think maybe. With you, I want to say. But the words wont come out. But Ill always need the sky, I say. Ive been thinking that if they wont give me the Dumah, then maybe Ill see if I can get work aboard another ship. At least until I can figure something else out. I think if I can fly from time to time Ill be okay. Well, then its a good thing you get to go back to it. Yeah... Get me your list, I say. We dont have a lot to barter with, but Ill see if Lewis can help. Maybe Diego, too. She nods, then looks at me, something unspoken in her eyes. Try not to get yourself banged up this time, she says. I wont be there to patch you up. Noted, I say. Good-bye, Ben. As I turn to go, I think about how I dont like the sound of that.         SIXTEEN Three weeks of supply runs, back and forth to Tamoanchan, and Im finally on the last one. It quickly became obvious that it didnt make sense to stop for quarantine, so its been grab and drop, grab and drop, grab and fucking drop. Unsurprisingly, Im having a great time. Its not the same as being on the Cherub, of course, and Im not the pilot, but Diego lets me take the Ospreys controls from time to time, and Im back in the air. Back to foraging. Back to my old life. The only difference is that Ive never really worked with a crew before, unless you count Claudia and my dad. For this last run, its Diego, Rosie, and meas usualand Maya, one of the new boffins we rescued from the prison camp. Miranda had the bright idea of sending a boffin along on each of the runs, to help identify what supplies were most needed and to help with some of the delicate equipment, which was a good idea. Me, I dont know a microscope from a spectroscope from a tele ... wait, I know a telescope. You know what I mean. So they didnt lose too much brainpower, they stuck to the same people, but for this last run, they sent along Maya. Mayas hoop earrings continue to throw me. I mean, why would you wear something like that? Theyd be too likely to get stuck on something. Like a Ferals finger. I picture it in my head, the skin tearing, an open wound just exposed, waiting to be infected. I cant suppress my shudder. Shes at least wearing a hat, a wide-brimmed, light-colored affair, and a colored scarf that wraps about her neck and can be pulled up to cover her face. Otherwise, her small form is fairly decently wrapped in sweaters and a worn-in pair of jeans. Most of what shes wearing is knitted. By the look of her eyes, shes got some Asian blood in her, but other blood, too. She catches me looking at her and smiles. I hope she doesnt get the wrong idea. So tell me again what this thing is? I ask. Its a cache of gear and supplies, she says. We had a pretty steady operation, Hector and me and the others, but we had backup supplies. In case of disaster. Or theft. Or attack. So we decided to stash some equipment in a safe place. And this could help Miranda. Definitely. We bring that back, and it will be a huge help. If you say so. Thing is, she says, leaning back against the wall of the gondola, the more machines we have to run these tests, the better. You need backups. You need contingency plans. As it is, were going to have to have people staffing the lab on a continuous basis. Or at least every time someone arrives back on the island. Which, sure, would be great. This has been something weve been working toward for a long time. Being able to keep the virus off of the island would be a huge, positive change for everyone. But its not foolproof. I mean, you can limit infection, but new people are always going to be tricky. They got lucky with me and Miranda. But its still a perilous thing. Bring in a new airship crew, for example, to help bring in supplies. And if you cant trust them, if they turn on you and sell you out to someone, then what? All it takes is one person to do something like that. Protecting against that is much harder. Which makes me wonder about Maya. I wouldnt rush to let someone like her off the island so soon after getting there, but it had nothing to do with me. Miranda put her on the list and Lewis cleared it. She was offering Miranda a prize, after all, another cache of supplies. And, like the other boffins, she seems more excited by the project theyre working on than anything else. Sounds like her previous group was pretty severely taken apart by the raiders. It still seems so strange. I can see why raiders would want to go after someplace like Gastown. Its valuable. It has helium. Plus, its a center of trade. They hold it, they get to reap the rewards. But boffin setups? All Ive been able to figure is that the Cabal wants to stop others from studying the Bug. They want to be the only game in town. Or maybe they just want to steal what everyone else has managed to figure out. I dont know. But their involvement in everything makes me uneasy. The Valhallans, I can try to understand. Theyre about power, pure and simple. The Cabal ... Im lost without a map. So, are you going to try to patch up this thing between you and Rosie? Maya asks me, interrupting my train of thought. It surprises me at first, but then she and Rosie have become quite chummy. I think its up to her, I say. Shes mad at me for putting Diego in danger. But didnt you? I shift in my seat. Yes. And Ive apologized to him. She crosses her arms. But have you apologized to her? To Rosie? She nods.  ... no. So you really havent tried to fix this. She thinks Im bad weather. And besides, what happened happened. I cant take it back. You could show remorse. I have. I do. I Shit. Is she right? Do you think I should? Maya shrugs. It seems like it might be a good idea. She shrugs again. Or maybe shell get over it on her own. Im tired of talking about this, so I try to shift the conversation. So how long have you and Hector been working together? Years, now, she says. He came from out East. From an enclave there. He came looking for a new group to work with and found us. And you? She smiles. I was born into it. Like Miranda. I guess. My parents were already part of a science commune when I was born. They taught me as I got older. Did you ever think of, I dont know, not doing what your parents did? Striking off and doing something else? She shrugs, then shakes her head. I dont think I ever did. It just seemed so ... important. That seems odd to me until I realize that I pretty much did the same. Ended up doing exactly what my father did, without ever questioning it. I only ever wanted to be a pilot and a forager. Not that it seemed important. It just seemed ... me. So your people were also looking for a cure? I ask. We were studying the virus, sure. Did you get very far? She looks up at me and for a moment her expression is unreadable. Yes, she says. As a matter of fact, we did. Then its too bad you dont have any of your data. She turns and smiles at me. She taps the side of her head. The good thing about passing down things from generation to generation is that you grow up with it. It gets ingrained in you. A lot of our data is up here. I cant imagine what that must be like, I say. I cant imagine what it would be like without it, she says. She shrugs. At least now I get to use it. Your Miranda is really quite remarkable. She reminds me of someone I used to know. Back at the settlement. Huh, I say. I have to say I consider Miranda to be one of a kind. Oh, of course, Maya says. I just meant her dedication. Shes the one who hired you? Yes. It was something of an accident. But... But? To be honest, I never really thought that Id still be here all this time later. But ... here I am. Are you two? What? I ask it just a little too quickly. She shrugs. The way I hear it, you two are incredibly close. She does things for you. You do things for her. Its clearly more than just a business arrangement. You people talk about this? You obviously werent raised on a science commune. No, I say. Theres always gossip. About whos fucking who. Whod like to be fucking who. I love science, dont get me wrong, but theres much more to life. Makes sense. So ... you and Miranda? Is none of your fucking business. She holds up her hands as if surrendering. Okay, okay. I was just curious. I dont know you people as well as everyone else. I was just curious about the lay of the land. Then it hits me for a moment. Maybe Maya is interested in me. Maybe thats why shes asking. Shes working for Miranda now. She wouldnt want to interfere with any relationship she might be in. That completely makes sense. So of course now Im looking at Maya in an entirely different way. Shes definitely attractive. Thats not why it feels weird. It feels weird because of Miranda. Because of how things have been going. But how have things been going? There was sex, yes, and some kissing, but where does that leave us? What are we to one another? And, more importantly, is that what I want? Something wrong? Maya asks. What? Youre just staring at me with a weird expression on your face. Sorry, I say. Great going, Ben. I was just distracted. She smiles at me. It is a fantastic smile. It cant hurt to get to know her a little, can it? Youre thinking about whos fucking who, arent you? I smile. Or whod like to be. She points a finger at me. Maybe we should compare notes. I think about what it must be like for her, all alone, only one friend with her in a strange place. The rest of their group wiped out. Did you lose anyone? I ask. Back at your lab? Her smile loses some of its humor. No one lasting, she says, her demeanor suddenly shaken. But its okay, she says, bouncing back. She smiles. I think there are always new possibilities. Ah, I think. There just might be. Diegos voice over the speaker breaks into the conversation. Were getting near the location Maya gave me, he says. You better head up here. So we return to the gondola, where Diego is flying and Rosie is helping him. She glares at me as I enter, then looks over at Maya, and I notice something strange in her look. As if shes embarrassed? I dont have much time to focus on it, though, because Maya moves to the gondola window and I follow. There! She points down at the ground, at a large, stone outcropping. See that tree? Next to the outcropping, standing proud, is an old, gnarled tree with a split trunk. Thats where it is. You used the tree as a landmark? I ask. What if it got damaged or chopped down? She looks at me like Im an idiot. Believe me, these days, trees last longer than most other things. Its a fair point.  Down on the ground, it really does feel like old times. My life until recently. Here I am, gun out, looking around for Ferals, keeping one eye on my scientist companion, only this time it isnt Miranda. I didnt miss this part as much. And without Miranda it feels strange. The bright spot is that Im not worrying about Mirandas safety, but then this whole venture is for her. To get her supplies. To move her closer to her detection system, ultimately to her cure. We set up a few traps around the entrance, Maya calls. It will just take a moment to disarm them. Huh. Traps. From boffins. I guess that makes sense. It reminds me of what I used to do on the Cherub. What kind of traps? I ask. Mostly bear traps, she says. They work the best in situations like this. A classic, I think. Id help you, but Im too busy looking out for Ferals, I say. Quite all right, she says. Im good with traps. I never realized how attractive it was to hear a woman say that. I move around the perimeter, looking for any signs of Ferals. The good thing is that I dont see any droppings. No tracks or anything. But that doesnt mean we wont attract their attention. Movement. Sound. The airship above us. They all scream out to Ferals. Can you give me a hand? Maya asks. Great, I say under my breath as I move over to where she is. I spare a quick look down and see that shes cleared dirt and grass and leaves from a metal plate set into the ground. Thats where everything is? She nods. Okay. On three. Mayas size means she cant lift too much, but together we manage to lift a corner of the metal plate and slide it to one side. A few pushes opens the gap so that we can get down into the pit they dug in the ground. I pass Maya a pistol, a small automatic. Keep this on you. Well work in turns. So we do. She passes things up to me and I make a pile in the netting that the Osprey has dropped from its cargo hold. I cover her when shes working and she covers me when I am. I admit that Im more nervous when shes covering me. The bright spot is that our back is pretty much up against the outcropping and the land around us is flat enough that we should see anyone or anything approaching. Mirandas going to be happy to see all of this, I say, as I put down a padded case of glassware and a microscope all snug in its own case. This looks like good stuff. Weve been collecting it for years, Maya says. She turns to look at me. Youre really invested in all of this, arent you? I shrug. I guess. I mean youre willing to risk your life for this effort. Well, I hope its not going to come to that, I say. Then, I realized a little while back that surviving wasnt enough. I wanted to help make the world a better place. And you think this is your way to do it? Dont you? I ask. She smiles. And how far would you go for this? The question freezes me for a moment. My inner voice says that Im talking too much to this stranger about private, personal things. But a moment later, I say, As far as it takes. Your life? I pause. Ive never been one for self-sacrifice. Ive always protected myself. But ... I gave the Cherub to save Tamoanchan. Almost gave my life. For an island full of strangers. For Miranda, I have no doubt. She may very well go on to find her cure. And me? Well, Im no big loss, right? Im always leaving chaos in my wake. Yes, I say. If it comes to that. Cries echo across the spacehigh-pitched and undeniably Feral. Maya looks at me. It just might. Shit, I say, raising my fathers revolver. The netting for the supplies is down, lowered from the Osprey. But the ladder isnt. I wave to Rosie, whos watching above us, to raise the winch. She does, and the line ascends, going taught, then taking the supplies up with it. As it passes my head, I see the first Feral. Over there! I yell, to attract Mayas attention. And then theyre running and were shooting and thats all we can focus on. I count automatically in my head. Twelve of them. Not much room for error. I fire. Three times in quick succession. Three of the moving figures go down. Are you a leg man? she asks. What? I dont look at her. Keep my focus on the Ferals. Some people like to shoot them in the legs. So they go down easy. Lets talk later, say, taking three more shots. Im vaguely aware of Maya shooting next to me. Vaguely aware that her targets are going down. Pretty good shooting for a boffin. Reloading, I call, and move to do so, depending on Maya to cover me. There are, miraculously, only two Ferals left. I quickly load the revolver, only to see Maya shooting down the last two. One chest shot, one neck shot. I look at her as the last one drops. Thats really great shooting, I say. She shrugs. I like to shoot. She sounds breathless. You must, I say. Thats the best Im cut off by something falling on top of me, slamming me to the ground. A second later, I smell what it is, the earthy, dirty, shitsmell of a Feral. Im facedown, and its on my back. Maya! I yell. I feel its grip on my arm and shoulder. Its knees on my back. Maya! Bracing one hand against the ground, I push as hard as I can, coming up and around and throwing the Feral off of my back. It springs to the side, and as I scramble to my feet, Maya puts two bullets into the matted and tangled mess of its head. I stand there, sucking in breath. My chest heaving. I look at her, the still-smoking gun at her side. What took you so long? I had to reload, she said. I quickly do the math in my head, and shes right. That Feral had great timing. Check me, I say. That thing was on my back. It might have drooled on me, or bled on me. I turn my back to Maya, and she looks me over. You look clean, she says. But you might want to change your shirt. I nod. Cmon. Lets get up to the ship before any others find us. I signal to Rosie again and the ladder drops. God, shooting gets me so excited, Maya says, slapping me on the arm. I turn and give her a look. Or at least I must because she says, Relax, cowboy. Youre not my type. Really? She gives me a smile and a nod. Yes, sir. Then Maya and I go up the ladder. Of course I send her up first, covering her the way I did Miranda all those times before. Then, sparing one last look around at all the dead Ferals, I follow. Its my favorite kind of exit.         SEVENTEEN My good feeling from the run fades a little as I think about quarantine. Yet again. As much as Im in favor of the approach, preventing the Bug from getting in, no one person should have to go through quarantine so much in such a short period of time. Ill be happy to go home, Rosie says. Even if it does mean quarantine again. Diego groans. Dont be such a baby, Rosie says. He turns to her. You like quarantine? She looks out the gondola window. At least its safe. Diego radios down to the ground for instructions, already turning the Osprey toward the landing field near the Orchard. But to our combined surprise, they instead direct him to a different field. On Tamoanchan proper. Can you confirm that? he asks, and they do. Diego looks at me and shrugs. But we proceed to the airfield as indicated. What did we do this time? I ask. Only what we planned to, Diego says. This cant be about us. It should be comforting, but its not. If theyre not letting us go to the Orchard, then maybe something happened there. A feeling grips my stomach, like a slow poison is eating away at my insides. Lets get down quickly, I say. And find out whats going on. Diego brings us in for a landing, and the ground crew helps secure us. Im the first at the ladder. As I hit the ground, I realize somethings not right. There are too many people gathered to meet us. And one of them is Miranda. Despite the strangeness, the relief floods through me. I flash her a questioning look, but shes got a smile a meter wide on her face. Lewis is also there with Brana, a few of the boffins, and some stern-faced Tamoanchan Keepers. To be honest, Im getting a little tired of peacekeepers. Dont think Im not appreciative of the welcome, I say. But this is a little much. Miranda pushes past the others and stands before me, smiling. We did it, Ben! she says. Did what? Our test. For the virus. We made it. You did? She nods, her smile still wide and infectious. She did it. You did it! I say. Goddamnit. I shake my head. Of course you did. I start trying to pull her to me, to hug her, but then realize I havent been through quarantine. Instead I squeeze my fists in a gesture of triumph. Miranda looks over to Diego, Rosie, and Maya. All of you get to be some of our first test subjects. So while we stand there (me trying to ignore the armed Keepers staring at me), Miranda takes samples of our blood. We dont have facilities yet, obviously, she says as my blood spills out into a tube. But well set them up at one or two of the fields to test anyone coming in. I look at the tube almost full with dark-red blood. Are you going to have enough of those? I ask. She nods. We have a stockpile. Im sure Mayas supplies have more. But its going to be a struggle. We can reuse needles with proper sterilization. My eyes widen. Are you sure, Miranda? This is the Bug were talking about. And we can test for it, now. If a subject is positive, well destroy the syringe. But if not, we can make sure it can be used again. Same for the tubes, if necessary. Well have to continue looking for more, though. I know what shes thinking. That this is only the first step in the grand plan. That soon theyll have what they really wanta cureand all of the test tubes and syringes and equipment left in the world can be devoted to making that work until its not needed at all. I squeeze her hand. I take it I missed the celebration? I ask. Yes, sorry. Lewis wanted to make his announcement after we had confirmed the test with the Feral blood. Of course. He wanted to make his play as soon as possible. She nods. It seems to be working. The people here seem pleased with this latest development. I thought they might be. I flash a smile at Brana, wondering if that pissed-off look is because Lewis scored a victory. With her its hard to tell. I hope theres some hooch left, I say. Miranda smiles back at me. I think we can dig some up. She grabs my arm. We couldnt have done it without you, Ben. Yes, you could, I say. But I make things harder so often that I suppose I was overdue for making something easier. If thats how it works, you have a lot owed to you. I can hope. They make us wait on the airfield, the Keepers never letting up with their intense stares. I have to admit that their presence is a good idea. Even if someone turns up clean, not infected, theres always the chance of conflict. Violence. And if the boffins are going to be here on the front line, they need protection. For a moment I consider the possibility of becoming a Keeper. I need something to do, and Ive mostly been good at protecting the boffins, but ... I cant really see myself in one of those brown-and-green uniforms. I cant see myself snapping to attention and following the orders of Lewis or Brana or any of the other members of the Council, like a good little soldier. I cant imagine me keeping the peace. Its not me. Well, Ben, you still need to find your place. Get to it.  We wait about an hour or so to be cleared. Mirandas science station has been set up nearby on the main island now. One of the other ships brought in an electron microscopesomething Miranda says can see really, really small, like virus-smalland together with some help from Lewis, they set it up on a vacant plot of land. They built a hasty structure around it for now, but thats where the blood samples will go, facilitated by runners and cyclists. I spend most of the time chatting with Diego, talking repairs on the Osprey, assessing the other ships on the field, while Rosie talks with Maya. The two of them seem to have really hit it off. They make a contrast, the two of themRosie, tall and athletic, hard and dark, and Maya, short and almost delicate, with golden skin. As I watch, Rosie smiles and, in a movement that seems uncharacteristic, reaches out and playfully pats Mayas arm. Oh, I think. I am such an idiot. Diego sees where Im looking and nods. Looks like Rosie found a friend. Yeah, I say. I cant believe I missed it. Im glad, he says. Its been ... I dont know how long. She doesnt open up to people much. I got that impression. Yeah, well, maybe this will soften her mood. To you. To everything. I hope so, I say. I like your sister. We worked well together at the helium plant. And it looks like were all going to be here for a while. You given much thought to what youre going to do? Long-term? I feel like thats mostly what Ive been thinking about, I say. And I still dont have any answers. Well, if we get cleared for free passage, you can fly with us on the Osprey. We could always use another pair of hands, or another gun. Youre thinking of going back to foraging? He nods. That or running errands for the Council. He scratches his beard. Theres no chance of me making the Council. Not anymore. Im sorry. He shrugs. Its okay. Im learning to live with it. It could be worse. I could be dead. Thats one way to look at it. I can still be of use, he says. And you can still get back into the sky. What do you say? I nod. First to myself, then to him. I think that could work. Thanks. Do you think Rosie will be okay with it? He gestures over to where she and Maya are smiling and laughing. I think I can convince her.  Anders comes back to us with our results instead of Miranda. After he clears us for entry (were all clean, as expected) he tells me that Miranda had to deal with something in the lab. I have a feeling that this is how things are going to be from now on. Shes got her people, her operation, and her goal is in sight. Not that I mind. Im happy to see her happy. In the meantime, I content myself with helping out where I can. I help Rosie and Diego and Maya unload the Osprey and move the equipment over to the new science station (which apparently still needs a namethe boffins have developed a very complex system, with charts and graphs, to determine one). I get a glimpse of the electron microscope, which is a massive and modern-looking piece of tech. Theyve stabilized the ground its on with some metal sheeting and heavy stones to anchor it. Theres also a mess of wires and cables around it. It looks like its hooked up to solar cells and several generators. Leave it to the boffins to figure out how something like that can work. Crazy Osaka in particular is pretty good at that sort of thing. I spend a moment looking for Miranda or Sergei, but they dont seem to be around, so I go back to town. I notice as I do that there are a lot more vehicles on the footpaths that lead around the island. Bicycles, mostly, some with passenger compartments on their backs. I think they call them rickshaws. I find myself tempted to take one, then realize that I dont have anything to barter with. Makes me think, though. Barter can probably only work out here for so long. At what point do people start switching to something else? A money system like they had back in the Clean. The concept seems foreign to me, but I think its probably inevitable. Its not that barter isnt a great conceptof course it is. I can see what youre offering me and in return I offer you something tangible, or a service or whatever. But the difficulty comes in the negotiation. And if youre a carpenter and I dont need any carpentry work done, what then? How do you get what you need? The world is changing around you, Ben. Can you change with it? When I reach town, I head straight for Lewiss office. Im sure theres a bureaucracy here, a system that I should be going through, but weve done a lot for him, so I figure he owes me. He leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers together. Do you need something? I cross my arms. Not me, Miranda. He frowns. I believe I addressed She needs a place to sleep, I say. Not that box you have them all crammed into now. Shes the head of this operation. She needs to stay sharp. His face goes hard. Im the head of this operation. I cant stop myself from rolling my eyes. She does all the heavy lifting. He chews on that for a moment. Ive already authorized the construction of new housing for Mirandas people. I picked a suitable spot, I think, between the main sprawl of town and the science station. But thats going to take a while, I say. She needs something now. His expression turns thoughtful, and he nods to himself. She has earned it. I bet hes picturing the ceremony where he gives it to her. In front of lots and lots of people. Demonstrating his benevolence. Do you have something for her? He nods and taps his wooden desk. There are a few places we can use. His face clouds. Weve lost some people recently. Togs and Pepper, for example. I look at him blankly. They were an older couple, here with us almost from the beginning. ... They were good people. What happened to them? I ask. They died, he says, surprised. I figured that. How? It was an infection. Not the Bug, of course, but just some kind of pneumonia. I know its irrational, but I wonder about moving in to a place that had disease. There are other places, too, Lewis says, as if reading my mind. Bates, you know him? I shake my head. He moved in with his partner, Tyler. His house is open. He waves a hand in the air. There are others. Great. He stares at me. You know I dont have the people to help set it up, dont you? Were stretched thin as it is with everything going on. I nod. Ill see what I can do. His expression verges on incredulity, but he inclines his head in agreement. Then you can have Batess place. Ill have one of the Keepers show you. Thank you, I say. So the Keeper shows me the place, a small, wooden cabin with three rooms and a place to build a fire. Seems like it would be perfect for Miranda. Theres a simple bed frame here, some furniture that was left behind. But its dusty, and the air smells stale. Its going to need some work. Well, Ben, youve been looking for a purpose. I do what I can to sweep the house and dust it. The windows are simple hatches in the side, wood reinforced by metal, but I open these and try to get the air circulating. Ive only ever really cleaned the Cherubs gondola. This is something of a new experience. Eventually it starts looking, and smelling, better. I spend the rest of the day searching the markets of Tamoanchan. I have my cut from the run out to Maya and Hectors stash. Some of the items that Miranda didnt need. The blankets (which seem remarkably clean), I keep. But there are other itemssome metal, a few mirrors, and some spicesthat make great barter. I trade for some items to fix up the house, and I return to it and set them up. Blankets, pillows, some simple plates to eat off of. Jugs for water from the nearby well. Things like that. And some cooked chicken. Someone here brought some birds back from the mainland and started breeding them. It cost a bundle (most of my good spices), but its worth it. Then I send a messenger off to Miranda and build a fire so that the house is nice and warm. Then I sit back and wait. Shes been working really hard. She deserves something special. It occurs to me that this will be our first time alone togethertruly alonesince, well, since the Cherub blew up. Something about that scares me. I wait for a while. Then a while longer. Im starting to get worried when theres a knock on the door. I can tell Mirandas knocking pattern immediately. I open the door with a wide smile on my face. It fades when I see Miranda. Shes been looking tired lately, of course, what with all the work and the poor sleeping conditions, but right now she looks worseher face tight, her eyes red, as if shes been crying. Whats the matter? I ask. She meets my eyes, and I see the sadness and pain there. Sergeis sick, she says.         EIGHTEEN They come for Sergei in the morning, with guns. Its a small islandword travels fastand this is the Sick. People are paranoid about disease. The Bug has taught us that. So they send four Keepers, each one carrying a rifle, to the house where Sergei is resting. They kick open the door, rifles out, and I freeze. One of the Keepers pushes me against the wall. Sergei is lying on the bed, Miranda is sitting next to him. Over him. I see the rage sparking behind her eyes. This man is sick! she says. Which is why we have to move him into quarantine, the head Keeper says, his voice muffled by the cloth wrapped around his mouth. Please move away from him. Miranda, Sergei says, his voice weak, Ill go. No, she says. No, you wont. I dont move, but thats only because theres a rifle pointed at my chest and I dont want to be splattered all over the wall. I can tell by the posture of the Keepers and the way theyre covered and protected that theyre not playing around. We have to take him in, the head Keeper repeats. And you have to move away from the body. This man needs treatment, not isolation. This man, per island laws, has to be put into quarantine, the head Keeper says, loudly and slowly. Youll have to shoot me, then, Miranda says. Miranda, I say. I wont let them take him. I examine the Keepers. Theyre all covered up, but I can see the tension in their posture. Theyre scared, tense. One of them could shoot Miranda. Lets just ... calm down, I say. No ones getting shot today. We can all agree that thats the last thing we want, right? The head Keeper looks at me. Why dont you send for Lewis? He can help straighten this out. The head Keeper continues to look at me. Its worth it if we can avoid bloodshed, right? The head Keeper turns to one of his men and tells him to go. The Keeper in front of me pushes his rifle barrel into my chest. Miranda turns back to Sergei, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief. I know shes just trying to comfort him, but its making me anxious. Shes wearing gloves, and shes been mostly using her scarf, but whatever Sergei has right now is a mystery. The thing is, I completely sympathize with these men. It doesnt matter if Sergei has the common cold, hes clearly sick and the cause, at least at this point, is unknown. Miranda tested him for the Bugwe know its not thatbut she cant tell what it is. Getting Sergei locked away is, frankly, the best way to deal with it. On the other hand, the Keepers are likely to throw him into a bare cell and leave him there to die. Mirandas the best person on the island to be with him, and he needs a bed, water to drink, care. I want to relax and wait for Lewis, but its hard with the rifle jammed into my sternum. And the head Keeper is looking at Miranda in a way thats making me uncomfortable. Move away from the body, he says. Hes not a body, Miranda says. His name is Sergei. The Keeper advances, his rifle up, pointed at Miranda. Move away now. The Keeper on me turns to look at their leader along with everyone else, and without thinking I swivel, quickly, slapping the barrel of the rifle away, slamming my head forward into his. Im already stepping forward toward the lead man and Miranda when three other rifles turn to bear on me. Everyone is yelling, but I cant make out the words. I want to reach for the revolver, but I force myself not to. I think, This is it. Im going to get shot here, a stain on the wall of the cabin I tried so hard to clean. Stand down! Everyone turns to see Lewis standing in the doorway, his eyes wide, his face rigid. Put your weapons down. Then, when no one immediately complies, Now! The Keepers lower their rifles. What the hell is going on? Lewis asks. She wont move away and let us take him, the lead Keeper says. He needs treatment, Miranda says. You have to let me treat him. Lewis crosses his arms. We have protocols about disease. You should understand that. Miranda keeps her voice low and even. Ive already tested him for Maenad. Hes clean. His symptoms are different. Do you know what he has, then? Lewis asks. Miranda is silent for a moment. No. Not yet. But I will. He needs to be in quarantine, Lewis says. And honestly, so do you. What? I ask. Whatever he has, youre probably exposed, Lewis says. You dont know that, Miranda says. We dont know what this is. Lewis shrugs. You wanted to treat him. To examine him. You can do that from quarantine. Ill need my equipment. My team. Uh-uh. Lewis shakes his head. He points at Miranda. Just you. But We have to limit exposure. You examine him, you figure out whats going on. Just you. Miranda opens her mouth, about to speak, and then just exhales into a sigh. Okay. Just me. I wonder if she would have agreed if it had been anyone other than Sergei. I think about offering to go with them, but ... I dont. I look at Sergei, his skin gray and drawn, his face shining with perspiration, and I dont. I curse myself for it. But I keep my mouth shut. I tell myself that Id be useless with them, and its true, but I still curse myself. Miranda gets to her feet. Well need to carry him, she says. I can help rig us a stretcher. There should be some wood nearby, from the new constructions, Lewis says. He sends two of the Keepers to go get something. Miranda catches my eye. Looks like its my turn to take the crown. She smiles, though theres no mirth in it. The Quarantine Queen. It wont be for long, I say. Youll figure out whats wrong with him. And youll fix it. She nods, but it looks as if shes not completely sure. I need you to help keep an eye on the team. Okay, I say. I mean it, she says. They tend to get a little ... scattered when Im not around. I noticed. I nod. Done. And... she says, and I dont like the look on her face. It looks like shes about to dare me. And what? And I need you to talk to Clay. Oh, great. I need you to ask him what Sergeis been doing. If hes been working with anything different or new. If he exhibited any symptoms before he collapsed. I sigh. Okay. For you and for Sergei. And Ben. Try to be nice. Me? Im always nice. She gives me a look that says she knows better. Okay, I say. Ill be as nice as I can. Good. She smiles at me again. We both stand there for a moment. I want to go to her, hug her, tell her its going to be okay. But I cant. If I do, Im joining them in quarantine. Instead, I say, Youll fix this. I know you will. It sounds weak. She gives me a nod. Send me a message if you turn anything up. I will, I say. And then the Keepers escort me out.  Before I see Clay, I stop off to see Rabbi Cohen. His synagogue is empty, but I find him straightening up. He smiles when he sees me. Ah, Ben, he says. Hes wearing a simple, knit cap today, sweater and pants both black. He comes forward to me, clasps my hands in his own. Then he must see something in my face because he says, Whats the matter? I came to ask you to pray for someone, I say. He frowns. Who? His name is Sergei. Hes one of the scientists I came here with. Hes sick. He places a comforting hand on my collar. I am very sorry to hear that. Are you two close? I shrug. I consider him a friend. But hes practically a father to Miranda. Ah, I see, he says. He gestures for me to sit on one of the wooden benches, and when I do he sinks down next to me. And you cant stand seeing her upset. I just ... shes been through a lot. And we just got a win with this detection test of hers and things are starting to settle down and then ... this. The rabbi is silent. He just stares at me. I like Sergei, I do. And of course I want to see him well. He chuckles. What? Youre human, he says. Youre unhappy because a friend of yours is sick. Youre also upset because someone you care for is upset. Yes, I say. I just ... I want him to be well. Who is taking care of him? Miranda. I see. Theyre in quarantine now. So thats why youve come to me. Im kinda running out of options, I say. Very well. He folds his hands in his lap. But let me ask you, why should I do the work for you? Why cant you pray yourself? I squirm a bit. Because it would be hypocritical. Because I dont believe. But because I do, that makes it okay? You do realize youre asking me to do something you claim not to believe in. Ill take whatever help I can get, I say. And if God is up there, listening, Im sure hes more likely to do you a favor than me. His face is skeptical. It makes perfect sense to me. Ben, you do realize that God isnt there for us to ask things of, right? I tried to explain that to you before. Look, Rabbi, like I said, Im willing to try anything at this point. Were so close, I say. So close to some kind of change. A good one. I can feel it. I just want us to get there. Is that optimism I hear? I guess. And I start wondering, When did I start believing Miranda? What convinced me that she might be right? Was it the test? Or was it when I realized I had feelings for her? Or is it just that Im sick of always being afraid. Cautious. Waiting for the sky to fall. The rabbi pats my leg. I will pray for your friend, Ben, he says. And I will pray for you and I will pray for Miranda. Not because you asked me to, mind you. But because I would have done so anyway, once I heard what was happening. Ill take it, I say. Thank you. I get up to go, and he shuffles off to continue his straightening up. You still havent shown up for services, he says as I turn away. Yeah. Ive been a little busy, Rabbi. Maybe when all of this is over? Im not asking you to pray. Or even to believe. Just come and sit. Listen to the words. Okay, I say. When all of this is over, Ill come. He smiles. Good. As I walk out, I realize that I actually mean it. Ill come back when Sergei is better and all this hubbub dies down, and Ill sit and listen to the rabbi sing the songs of my childhood. A part of me cant wait.  The thing about the rabbi is that being with him, talking to him, ultimately calms me. Theres something in his demeanor, or something about him, that generates a sense of ease in me. A feeling that everything will be okay. He relaxes me. Clay is the exact opposite. I prepare myself as I walk to the lab, telling myself to be nice, that its for Miranda, that its for Sergei, and I think I have it down. I can be nice to him. I can ignore how I felt about him in the past. But then I see his smug face, the expression that flits over it as I walk in, and I just want to punch him. Mirandas not here, he says, his eyes back on whatever work hes doing. I know. Shes with Sergei. In quarantine. Oh, he says. He looks up. How is he? The same, I say. At least Miranda gets to stay with him. Lewis is going to give her some of her equipment. Good, he says. I dont suppose theyll let anyone else in? I shake my head. Only Miranda. Damn, he says. Miranda wanted me to ask if you noticed anything weird about him before he collapsed. Or if he had been working with anything new or different. He was working on the detection test, same as everyone else, he says. He wasnt even working with any blood at all. Just the reagents. Could one of those have caused this? No, he says. I cant imagine how. And weve all been working with them. Did you notice any symptoms? I ask. Clay sits back and crosses his arms across his chest. Nothing that couldnt also seem to be the results of overworking. He looked tired. A bit rundown. But most of us do. Weve been working practically nonstop for days. If I had noticed something, dont you think I would have said something? And to someone other than you? Look, I say. Im asking for Miranda. Im not trying to imply anything. Shes worried about Sergei. Clay stands up. Im worried about him, too, he says. Im the one whos been with him this whole time. While you and Miranda were off having adventures in the sky. Adventures? I say, feeling my face get hot. Fucking adventures? Which recent events would those be? Me losing my ship? Me getting shot? Diego getting tortured? My ship blowing up? Getting thrown in a cell multiple times? My voice is getting louder now. Dont forget that I helped get you that data from Gastown. Or that I helped free the boffins from that camp. Or that I fucking stopped raiders from dropping Ferals on your head. He moves forward. The team wouldnt have even needed rescuing if you hadnt run back at Apple Pi. Shut your fucking mouth. I move closer to him. You werent fucking there. And what about the rest? What about my friends who are still unaccounted for? Clay. And it was your presence on Gastown that gave away our location in the first place. Because Ben loses his ship and Miranda jumps to help him get it back. Its your fault you had to blow your fucking ship up. Mirandas too. Its all I can do not to tear into him. Theres something red and pulsing behind my eyes and my fists are clenched at my sides, wanting to be used. And Im supposed to be happy because, what, because Miranda decided to pretend to be a spy and got us some data from Gastown? Please. Wait, I say. Who are you mad at? Me or her? Both of you! She changed after you came along. She used to be focused on the work. On the science. Now she drops it all every time you get stuck in a ditch. And if you havent noticed, you fall into an awful lot of ditches. She leaves Sergei and me here alone, trapped here, to continue the work while she plays zep with you. Some of the heat inside of me starts to fade. Im starting to get it now. He is mad at Miranda. Probably a little because he has a thing for her, but mostly because Clay is a zealot. A science zealot. To him theres nothing higher. And Miranda has at least partially replaced it with caring about people. In Clays world, the science comes first. And thats one of the reasons I cant stand him and I much prefer Mirandas company. I force myself to take a deep breath. I unclench my hands. I hold them up placatingly. Its all I can do to keep them still. Im not here to fight, I say. You have issues with me and Miranda, fine. But this isnt about us. Its about Sergei. And he didnt leave you. Hes been here with you for the past few weeks. And he needs your help. Clay exhales loudly, and his shoulders drop from their bunched-up position. Like I said, hes been rundown lately. He rubs his temples. I thought it was just exhaustion. He pauses. And age. Sergeis the oldest. I thought the years were just catching up to him. And now? Now I think its something else. He sighs. Ill get in touch with Miranda. Get her a message through quarantine. Ill see how I can help. He lowers his head back to his work. I guess thats it, then. I turn to go. Does it scare you? he asks, just as Im about to walk out. My first thought is hes asking me about the disease. The answer is yes, but Im not going to tell him that. What the fuck are you talking about? Your extinction. The world is moving on. I think you know jack shit about the world, seeing as youve been stuck here for weeks. Were building something here. Something new. There are no bones for you to pick here. I can think of a few that are begging to be broken. He nods. There it is. The threat of violence. Your first and last resort. Fuck you, Clay. You left out my profanity. He shakes his head. Dont get too comfortable in your new world just yet, I say. Youre not the first to think youve emerged from the Sick. Not the first to think youve evolved. Im all for civilization, but its not made of bricks, its made of paper. I like paper. So does fire. I hold his gaze. Remember what happened to Gastown. He looks away. Thats the problem with paper, I say. Someone can always black out everything you wrote. Then well keep writing, he says. I nod. Lets hope in the end that someone is around to read the book.  Two more people get sick the next day. Then five more the day after. Lewis is losing his mind. Miranda has been telling him its not the Bugand it cant be, otherwise people would have Faded by now. Wed have Ferals on our hands. Instead, Sergei is just wasting away, and now others have joined him. Literally, too. They moved them out to Mirandas lab. The new one. They wanted to move them all to the Orchard, but Miranda needs access to her equipment. Everyone else has been ordered to stay in their homes and to limit contact with anyone else. The whole island is afraid. And as far as I can tell, Miranda has no idea whats happening. Which makes me afraid. Mirandas spent yearsdecadesworking on the Bug, but this is entirely new. I check on the rabbi to make sure that hes okay. He is, thankfully. But hes staying inside. Me, Im supposed to, but I cant. Big surprise. I have Mirandas house to hide in, but it feels alien and empty now. Im wandering the streets, ducking Keepers, when Clay finds me. Good, he says. Ive been looking for you. And thats when I really know that things are badbecause Clays glad to see me. Whats wrong? He ruffles his short, brown hair. Theres a lot more gray in it, it seems, than I remember. I found something on the electron microscope. What kind of something? He sighs. Miranda sent out a sample of Sergeis blood and asked me to run it through the machine. Just on the off chance it might tell us something. And? We hear some shouts, and both of us look around us. Can we get off the street? Clay asks. Okay. I nod. We can go to ... my house. I bring him back and let him in. He looks around quickly but doesnt say anything. He looks uncomfortable. I found something. I figured that. How much do you know about Maenad? I shrug. A little. What Mirandas told me. What I picked up from the rest of you. He looks at me, as if searching my face. The Maenad virus has a very specific structure. It has a shell around it, a protein shell. Thats part of what weve been able to assemble with our data and the new data Miranda stole. What does that have to do with this new disease? He shakes his head, already impatient with me. But he closes his eyes, inhales, and starts again. Whatever it is thats infected Sergei has the same protein shell. Its the Bug? No, he says, on the verge of exasperation again. Its not Maenad. Only the shell is the same. So, what, its some kind of mutation? I dont think so, Clay says. I grit my teeth. You know I dont know much about this, Clay. Plot me a course. A mutation of the Maenad virus would still resemble the virus. This is something completely different. From all the evidence, the disease seems to be autoimmune. Sergeis body is attacking itself. Thats not the way Maenad operates. The only reason I can see for the resemblance is that this new disease, this new virus, was engineered. Wait a second, I say. Something Miranda told me weeks ago comes flooding back into my brain. Miranda said that the Cabal was studying the Bug so that they could use it. She said it was possible that they could, I dont know, scrape out its guts and use it to carry something else. He looks at me, his face grim. A crude way to put it, but essentially, yes. I think thats what we have. I start pacing the room. So this isnt natural? I dont think so. Damn it! I feel something roiling in the pit of me. Something hot and angry. This was scary and bewildering when it was something unknown and natural, but now its a weapon. And that means that someone pointed it at us. Fuck! Im looking for something to throw when I catch Clays Im-not-at-all-amused look. Are you finished? Sorry, I say. Why are you telling me, though? Why not just tell Miranda? I will, he says. Im on my way there. But ... you have a different set of skills. I look at him, surprised. You want my help? What I want is to cure this new disease and for Sergei to get better. And Im going to focus on that. But we dont know where the new virus came from. And someone should look into it. Why me? Why not go to Lewis? Or the Keepers? Because like it or not, you know Sergei. You know us. I may not like you, but I trust you to look out for Sergei and Miranda more than a politician or a group of peacekeepers. You saw what they did to Miranda. Okay, I say. Anything else you can tell me? Maybe how its transmitted? He shakes his head. I dont know that. All I can tell you is that as far as I can tell, its not airborne, he says. But data is extremely thin right now. Ill see what I can do. He nods, then turns to go. I guess theres still a place for me, Clay, I say at his back. He turns back to me. Prove it, he says, before walking out. Believe me, I think. I intend to.         NINETEEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Im failing Sergei. I am having no luck with this virus, and hes the one whos paying the price. I sat with him today, as Ive been doing every day since he got sick, and he could barely lift a cup to his mouth to drink. Fatigue and muscle weakness are just two of the symptoms, and its progressing so fast. Too fast. My best guess is that its some kind of autoimmune disease, that his system is destroying its own cells. Breaking him down from the inside. Its insidious, but what makes it worse is that I cant seem to get a handle on it. It may share a structure, or part of a structure, with Maenad, but its a completely different virus. How the Cabal created it, I dont know. I cant really afford to think about it, either. Every time I do, I start to slip into a blind rage, and thats not going to help anyone. But I keep making notes in the margins of my notebooks. They all say the same thing. They will pay. In the meantime, I split my time between trying to crack this virus and trying to make Sergei comfortable. We sit for little breaks, and we talk about everything. How the eggs used to taste back on the commune, and how Ive never been able to find chickens to match. I confess to him that I accidentally let a whole crop of tomatoes die and blamed it on a blight. He talked to me about his childhood growing up. His father was pre-Maenad. He came from Russia and made sure that his sons knew it. Sergei and Nikolai. Sergeis face clouded over when he talked about his brother. Nikolai died when Sergei was a teenager. He never really talked much about him. I just know it was an accident. I asked him how he came to the commune. I knew he hadnt been born there, but remarkably I had never asked him how he got there. I just regarded him as a fixture. My father mixed ... chemicals to get by, he said. He taught me how to do it. What kind of chemicals? I asked. He tried to shrug, but the effort made him wince. A little bit of everything, he said. That included everything from lamp oil and refreshed gasoline to paralytics and narcotics. When Sergeis father died, Nikolai looked after him. When Nikolai died, he looked for someplace he could be useful. And he found the commune. They taught me other skills, he said. And I found ... I found I wasnt too old to learn them. The rest I didnt need to be told. How he befriended and studied with my father. How he took me in after my parents had died. And yet he talked about that, too. You were so ... angry, he said. I was? You dont remember? I shook my head. My memories of that time are something of a blur. But in the end I remember Sergei taking care of me, and focusing on the science. I pushed myself. I still regret my parents dying, but their death spurred me to be better than I was. You were an angry girl. Angry at the world for taking your parents away. Angry at Maenad. Such anger... Now, here, years later, I can imagine it. Such anger. You helped me turn away from that, I said. Maybe. His voice was thin and thready. I might have helped. But I think you did a lot of it yourself. Threw yourself into the work. I ... I worried. That maybe you would turn to science for all of the answers, and wall yourself off from your emotions. He shook his head. But you never did. His smile was thin. Its one of the things Im most proud of. I squeezed his hand, gently. So, yes, we talk about so many things. He told me how he and Clay had bartered for a book from the mainland, smuggled in with one of the inspection crew. A book of old games. And how they passed their time by working through it. I quite liked croquet, he said. That was interesting. Of course we had to use tree branches for clubs and our ball wasnt anything like it was supposed to be. But I had fun. It made me smile then. It makes me smile now. Thinking of Clay and Sergei playing croquet (whatever that actually looks like). I thought about asking him, but he moved on to talk about other sports. We talk about golf and cricket and soccer. The only thing we dont talk about is the new virus, which Ive named Enigma. I know Sergei wants to know about it, wants to see if he can help, but I just cant bring myself to do it. I dont want him to know exactly what hes up against. Or how in the dark I am. And its a moot point anyway. There isnt much that he could do. Hes lucid at times, but hes weak. He sleeps a lot. And sometimes his mind wanders off, lost in the pain and fatigue. How could he help? He would just end up frustrated. And yet I am frustrated. I have the others helping meweve taken to sending notes back and forth. We fold papers and send them through slots, carried by gloved Keepers. My wardens are friendly, but I dont think they realize what theyre doing, or how even this quarantine is slowing us down. My hope right now is that Ben can find out something about Enigma. Where it came from or how it was transmitted or, really, anything. New people are being infected every day, and I am working for them as well. We need to stop this. But I would be lying if I didnt admit that my heart was right here. With Sergei. And ... if he doesnt make it, a part of my heart will die right here with him. Its funnyI used to hate phrases like that. Leaving my heart. Because the heart is an organ and it has nothing to do with emotion, and because I always fall back on the science. But its really the best way to say what this feels like. That something inside of me, something so vital and central and important, is breaking. I think a lot about how Sergei took me in after my parents died. He was close with my father, and I think he felt it was his duty to help look after me. And he did. And he recognized that that little girl, who had just lost her two teachers and mentors, needed to work. To learn. To throw herself into something. And so he gave me just that. Gave me exactly what I needed when I needed it most. Damn it, why am I just realizing now how much Ive depended on him over the years to be my rock? Knowing Sergei was there meant there was always a place to retreat to. Always a home no matter where we were. He encouraged me in every endeavor I put my mind to. He supported my vision of a cure. And he did everything in his power to make that vision a reality. Did he do it for the world? Or for me? And does it really matter? No, of course not. And so how can I not do everything I can for him right now? Whether thats studying the structure of Enigma or rubbing his painful limbs and listening to him talk of the old days. Whatever it takes is my mantra. Whatever it takes. Whatever it takes. They will pay.         TWENTY For the first time since this new bug hit, I feel useful. Miranda can attack it in the world of science, but maybe I can attack it in the real world. I know she would hate to hear me frame it like that, but at the moment I dont care. To help me tackle it, Ive enlisted Diego. Im at his place instead of the new house. Pacing again. Diego sits in a chair, leaning back against the wall. We still dont know how its transmitted, I say. Could be like the Bugthrough fluidsor it could be something else. Clay didnt think it was airborne. He said something about transmission and vectors. Basically, a lot more people would be sick. But we still dont know how it works. So what do we do? Diego asks. Maybe we can look at the infected people and try to figure out what they all have in common. Eight people are infected right now. Six are boffins. Two are not. On the surface, there doesnt seem anything to tie them all together. The two non-boffins are just normal Tamoanchan residents. A woman named Janice whos a server at the Frothy Brew and a man named Shep whos a carpenter. Only a couple of the boffins have even been to the Frothy Brew (most prefer to brew their own hooch). And while Shep worked on the new lab facilities, it sounds like he never really interacted with any of the boffins. Hmmm... Diego says. He scratches at his beard with his good arm. The question is whether they were all infected independently or whether it spread between them. I nod. I thought maybe the Frothy Brew. The beer. But that doesnt make any sense. Diego tilts his head. Maybe a better question is, how did they get it here? The disease. I nod. Ive been thinking about that. Maybe the boffins were infected with it back in the camp. And then we brought it back when we brought them here. Its something thats been nagging me for a little while. That maybe I was responsible for bringing the disease here. Maybe Sergei being sick is my fault. But why was Sergei the first to get sick, then? Diego wonders. He wasnt in the camp. No, I say. And the prisoners should have been the first to show symptoms. Yeah. I throw my hands up in the air. I wish Claudia was here. Shes much better at this thing than I am. Rosie walks into the room, and I immediately tense up. She crosses her arms and leans back against the wall. Youre doing this all wrong, she says. You have to try to think like them. Like the Cabal, I say. She nods. Okaaay, I say. Let me fetch my evil-genius hat. She just stares at me, unamused. Fine. So Im in the Cabal. We created the virus. Theyre calling it Enigma, Rosie says. I know, I say. We created Enigma. Why? Diego asks. Because we can, I say. Because its easier than sending raiders in to attack. Instead, we infect everyone, let their bodies turn on them, then we just walk in and take over. Thats fucked, Diego says. Completely fucked, I say. But it makes sense. By all accounts, these assholes want to take as much as they can get. They teamed up with Valhalla for manpower, but now they dont need it. They let the disease work for them. The question is, Diego says, were they targeting us? I think we can assume they were. We thought all this time that they might not have our location, because no raiders came. What if this was their aim all along? They want to take us out with the vi ... with Enigma. I feel sick, Diego says. What? Rosie asks. A figure of speech. They couldnt have come close to the island with a ship, Rosie says. It would have been spotted. Something starts itching in my brain. Something I cant quite seem to scratch at. Scraps of a story. Diego and Rosie continue talking about ships and boats and goods being brought in for barter. Wait, I say. What? Diego asks. The horse. The what? The horse. They both look at me blankly. Theres this story about a wooden horse. People hid inside of it, and when it was brought into the city, they snuck out to attack. What the hell are you talking about? Diego asks. They didnt need a boat or an airship or barter. They let us bring them back. When we rescued the boffins! But we figured out that they didnt infect them. But we brought back a few extra people, didnt we? Rosie steps forward. You mean Maya and Hector? I nod. Everyone is quiet. Its not them, Rosie says. Why not? I ask. She meets my eyes with her steely gaze, her jaw set. Because Ive talked to them. Got to know them. I cant see them doing this. You know them that well, I say. I shake my head. Boy, Rosie, you move fast. Then shes moving, crossing the space, and she grabs my shirt and pushes me back, slamming me into the wall. Rosie! Diego is on his feet, pulling her away from me with his good arm. He turns her to him. Ben is not the enemy. Are you sure about that? she spits back at him. Im sorry, I say moving forward. You must have your head stuffed up your ass. Youre defending them and calling me an enemy? Youre the one who leaves wreckage in your wake. I shake my head. Too bad Im not a woman. I could bat my eyes and sway my hips and youd just turn over for me. I dont see the fist until its right in my face. But I feel it. The punch sends me back into the wall. I throw my hand down to brace myself. The kick comes a moment later. I twist away, but it catches me in the ribs. Rosie! Diego shouts. It must make her slow for a second because the second punch is clumsy and I grab her arm and pull her forward, lifting my knee into her midsection. It connects solidly and knocks the air out of her. I take advantage by slamming her into the wall. Ben! Diego yells. But I ignore him. For a moment. Because he grabs me with one massive hand and tosses me to the side. As Im regaining my balance, I see him plant himself in front of Rosie. You both are going to stop acting like fucking fools, he said. Or else Im going to put you both down. I stay where I am, sucking in air, feeling the pain of Rosies hits throb through my body. Diego turns to me. Are you finished acting like a damned idiot? Is she? He shakes his head, and the look on his face makes me feel ashamed. But the pain in my ribs sparks the anger again. Im trying to figure things out here. For Sergei and Miranda. And we need to talk to Maya and Hector. Yes, Diego says. We do. Rosie looks at him like he just kneed her in the gut. And what if its not them? What if theyre innocent and this came in on some ship full of supplies? What if we pursue this and let the real source slip away? Thats not a bad question, I think. Theres nothing to say that it didnt happen that way except that it would require the Cabal knowing our ships. Knowing that whatever they planted would be brought back here and used in the right way. It seems like a bit of a stretch. Are you saying that Maya and Hector just hung out in that prison camp? Rosie asks. Waiting for you and Diego to rescue them? That sounds like a great plan. Diego squints at me. Its a fair point. And it is, but something about it feels right to me. The other boffins said that they were being held in another facility. A school. But they were moved to the camp. And Maya and Hector were brought in separately. We dont know much about how they came to be there. So youre just going to assume theyre enemies? Rosie asks. Im not assuming anything. But we need to ask the questions. I meet Rosies eyes. Were just going to talk to them. Not throw them in a cell. And theyre not our only possibility. Diego and I will also talk to any recently returning ship captains. But we cant just let this go. Rosie sighs and shakes her head. Hes right, Diego says. We need to at least talk to them. Youre making a mistake, she says, eyes on Diego. Were just supposed to accept Mirandas people because ... what? They vouch for them? Well, I vouch for Maya. Are you going to tell me that their word is worth more than mine? They stare at each other for a moment. Then Diego crosses his arms in front of his chest. Rose, Miranda and Ben and Sergei have known these people for months. Youve known Maya for days. Im glad Im not the one Rosies glaring at like that. Fine, she says, short and sharp. Well talk to them. But youll see that this is a waste of time. And I hope that this waste of time doesnt mean we miss the real cause. Well go together, Diego says. Get it done quick. If we get nothing, we look elsewhere. He pauses and looks at me. Yes? Yes, I say. He looks at Rosie. I said I would. Good, Diego says. Are you up for this? I ask, eyeballing Diego. My arm is fine. He flexes it. See? Three weeks have gone a long way toward healing it. Im going. Okay. But to which new boffin? There are two of them. I look over to Rosie, who still seems to be fuming. Well talk to Hector first. I think I see Rosie relax just a little. I probably shouldnt give her that, but I do. Im not even sure why. All right, Diego says. He opens a drawer in a battered cabinet and pulls out a second pistol, tucks it into his waistband. Just in case. I hold up a hand. Were just going to talk. There are still too many questions. Diegos face goes hard. Id like to ask some questions for a change. Well, first we need to find them. Should we let the Keepers know? Diego asks. I shake my head. I think they might tip our hand. Best to go in small. Keep this quiet. I look at Rosie. Can you do that? She just glares at me. Fair enough. Lets go see what we can find out.  Going after Hector makes me feel like a lawman, like an old sheriff from a western story. I even have the star pinned to my coat. Throw your irons on the ground. Dont make me shoot, I think. Only this isnt a story. Hector and Maya might hold the information that we need to stop this disease. Maybe even to cure Sergei and the others. My latest message from Miranda said that he was deteriorating quickly. The disease, Enigma, sounds insidious. Ive been afraid of the Bug my entire lifea virus that takes you away from yourself, steals your mind and leaves only your body and urges behind. This new disease turns your body against you. Your mind stays intact, but your body fails. Like some kind of dark reflection. No, I think. Not a disease. A weapon. A biological weapon used to attack. You alright? Diego asks beside me. Youre all tensed up. Yeah, I say, exhaling and willing my body to uncoil. That wont do any good now. Im just ... physical threats I can handle. I know how to put them down. I pat the revolver strapped to my leg. This disease ... I cant shoot it. And the people behind this are operating on an entirely different level. Then I guess its lucky we have Miranda, he says. Rosie doesnt say anything. Her face looks tight. But then Im used to that. Mirandas got a lot to deal with right now, I say. Things were bad enough with Valhalla and the raiders. But now theres all this going on. These people, the Cabal, theyre smart. Incredibly, cruelly, sadistically smart. Diego gives a quick shake of his head. Theyll still die if you put enough bullets in them. I give an answering nod. I guess theres that. At the lab, I ask a few of the boffins if theyve seen Hector. They point me to the far building. Most of them have been put to work on studying this new disease. Problem is, the majority of their protocols have been designed to deal with the Bug. Enigma has some similarities, obviously, based on its design. But its an entirely different animal. An old saying my father used to use comes back to me. A wolf in sheeps clothing. Only this is more a wolf in bears clothing. We move among the boffins, trying to look casual about things. Not like were after anyone. No sense in tipping off our prey. Why dont you both go around the back way, I say. One on each side. That way if he spooks you can cover the exit. Okay, Diego says. I look to Rosie. Shes still not happy, but she nods. And try not to shoot. I know, he says. We dont want to kill him. Or any of the boffins. Theyre going to be scared regardless. Lets try to keep this tight. Got it, Diego says. I move to the building while Diego and Rosie peel off, each heading to the back of the building from a different side. Nice and tight. Hector is inside, bending down over a microscope, a pile of papers stacked next to him, some glassware nearby. I think of Miranda talking about how good glassware is hard to find. I should try to make sure none of it gets smashed. I approach him, what I think is a friendly look on my face. Truth be told, its a little hard not to look tense and worried, but I do what I can. Hector, I say. He looks up from his microscope, noticing me, and looking a bit surprised. Ben, he says. Just heard from Miranda, I say, moving closer. Positioning myself between him and the other boffins. Trying to keep some space around us if it turns violent. That glass could be a problem if he decides to use it. Oh, he says. Does she need something from me? She just wanted to talk to you. Get your opinion on something. I dont know. Some disease-vector thing. Oh, okay, he says. Im just finishing this up. When does she want to see me? Now, if its okay. Well, I really should finish up what Im doing. I cant leave it and get back to it without starting over again. Okay, I say. How much time do you need? Well, I dont know. Its a bit delicate. Can you check back in a half hour? Fuck. This isnt going as Id hoped. I thought maybe hed walk back with me and we could get him somewhere safe and question him there. Hector searches my face. I see lines in his drawn face I hadnt noticed before. Its really important, I say. Its about Sergei. I think you should come now. Youll just have to redo the test again later. He frowns. Continues to search my face. Then he shrugs and says, Okay. If its important. Let me just clean this up so someone else can use the station. He removes the slide from the microscope, places it in a case. Turns to shift some papers. Then he turns back, fast, and I feel the bite of pain across my collarbone, just below my neck. I fall back and gasp. And he runs. The pain is still burning and I can feel myself bleeding, but I give chase anyway. I cant let him get away. He runs, as expected, to the back of the building where Diego and Rosie are waiting. I skirt around a stool that he tipped over, then through the door just as a gunshot echoes around me. I see Hector sprinting away, to the western part of the island, where its less populated. Where some of the ships are kept. Diego is on the ground, his gun in his hands, pointed in Hectors direction. Diego looks okay, as in not dying, so I continue, still trying to ignore the burning in my chest. Hectors tall and has long legs, but hes really thin. I hope that means hes likely to tire before I do. But its been a while since Ive run anywhere, and my body has been through a lot lately. I just keep thinking of Sergei and Miranda. And my enemies. The people who think they can fuck with those I care about. Those shadows who want to manipulate the world from the darkness. I cant let them get away with it. I put on a burst of speed and close some of the distance. Hector is just ahead of me, skinny limbs pumping. His shoes are thin and worn. Another advantage I have on him. Thank you, Mal, I think. You helped me more than you know. The distance closes and Im just there, one big jump and I can get him. Were about to head down a light slope, and I want to get him before we hit it. Then my boot catches on somethinga rock, a root, whateverand I go tilting through the air. Im still behind Hector, and I slam into himhardand together we smack into the ground with crushing intensity, a tangle of limbs and bodies. I feel my wind go and Im rolling and the sky is whirling, and when I stop, hes on top of me in an instantand theres something in his hands. Something long and thin. Not a knife. A syringe. And it comes to this againdisease, a worse threat than cutting or stabbing. I grip his wrists and hold his hands away. I can see a bead of liquid on the end. What happens if it falls on me ... ? Were both breathing hard. Im stronger, but Hector is letting gravity do a lot of the work for him. Have I mentioned how much I hate gravity? Is that how you did it? I snarl between gritted teeth. Injections? He doesnt say anything, just bears down on me. His face is intense but also strangely emotionless. Calculating. Then I hear another gunshot. For just a second, Hectors attention wavers, his eyes flicking up to see whats beyond me, and in that instant I force his hands to the side and get a punch in on his face, then another one. Then one on his ribs. I throw all my weight to one side and he tips over. I grab hold of the wrist with the syringe and hold it down. Then Diego is standing over me, his pistol out. Let go, I say, and Hector, knowing hes beaten, lets go of the syringe. I grab it gingerly by the non-pointy end and snap off the needle. Then I pass it to Diego. You have a pocket you can throw this in? He takes it, and I pat Hector down, taking away the knifea curved, dangerous-looking knife, not the kind of thing I would expect from him. Its too late, Hector says, his voice flat. Its already far too late. Diego hands me some rope, which I use to bind his hands. Wheres Rosie? I ask. Diego shrugs. She wasnt there when I got around the back. Fuck. I need you here, I say. But I know, he says. I need to go find her. Then we haul Hector up and start marching him back to Miranda. I take a moment to examine my injury. As the adrenaline starts to fade, the pain intensifies. Theres a gash across the very top of my chest, which scraped against the bone. It just missed my neck, which I assume was his original target. The collar of my coat must have deflected it. That looks nasty, Diego says. Itll keep for a minute, I say. Ive got Hector. You should go find Rosie. Are you sure? Diego asks. I pull my fathers revolver and hold it close to Hector. Im sure, I say. If he gives me any trouble, Ill shoot out one of his kneecaps. And we need to know where Rosie is. Im starting to think I know, Diego says. One big hand massages the back of his neck. Okay. Ill go find her. He takes a quick look at Hector, then tells me, Good luck. Same to you, I say. Then, after he goes, I start marching Hector onward, the revolver close at hand. Hector is silent all the way back.  Shes where? Theres this persistent buzzing in my head. A pressure. And the words just arent making sense. We dont know where she is, Ben. Diegos voice is level, but the look on his face says that things are far from right. Its tight, worn, and I see echoes of his torture in it. What did you do? I ask, pointing at the third member of our group. Rosie. Her arms are crossed, and shes leaning back against the wall, not unusual for her, but theres something more in her posture and her face. Something Ive never seen before. It looks like shame. Answer him, Diego says, and his voice is steel. No give. I went to see Maya, she says. The pressure intensifies. So while your brother and I were risking our lives to talk to Hector, when we could have used backup, backup that we were expecting, you left to go ... tip off the other person we suspected? My voice keeps getting louder. You suspected, she says. I step forward and narrow my eyes. And how is that position holding up? She looks away. Stupid, I say. She doesnt respond. Tell me what happened with Maya. She looks up at Diego, as if for help, but his face is like his voicehard. I told her I needed to talk to her, she says. Her voice sounds softer than usual. Hesitant. I felt I owed it to her to let her know that you would be questioning her. I wanted to... To what? Diego asks. She meets his eyes. To give her a chance to prove her innocence. To get out ahead of this. I cross my arms. And how did that go? Rosie flushes. She tricked me, she says. She kissed me, then ... she took me by surprise, got the better of me. By the time I recovered, she was gone. It smells like bullshit. Little Maya against bad-ass Rosie? Im about to attack that part of the story but then I catch sight of Diegos face, see the doubt carved into it. He knows shes lying, too. So shes, what, somewhere on the island? Or did you loan her the Osprey during this whole encounter? Rosie glares at me and steps forward, and I brace for the blow. Then, Stop. Diego. Its not a shout, but its certainly a command. I can almost hear a growl behind it. Rosie freezes. Ben is not in the wrong here, he says. You are. She looks up at him, more shame on her face, and something else. Fear? Diego, she says. I thought I had something good. For the first time in ... maybe for the first time. I know you wanted this, he says. But you got played. Its as simple as that. A lot of people are hurting right now, and you let one of our best leads slip away. We need to see if we can find her, I say. Let the Keepers know. See if we can dig her out. It shouldnt be hard. There arent too many places she can go. The only place she could swim to would be ... the small island. Oh God, I think. Alpha. We need to find her, fast. Ill go talk to the Keepers, Diego says. Get them out looking for Maya. He looks at Rosie. Youre coming with me. She nods, her eyes down. Make sure you tell them they need to guard Alpha. Diego frowns. The Feral? I nod. That island is mostly deserted now. It wouldnt be hard for her to sneak onto it and try to break Alpha out. What good would that do? Do you want to find out if a Feral can swim that far? Good point. It may not be her plan, but these people like letting Ferals do their work for them. What will you do? Diego asks. Im going to make sure our prisoner is secure and get ready to interrogate him.  We put Hector in one of the quarantine cells because that seemed like the best place for him. Tamoanchan does have a prison, apparently, but that seemed too good for him. Im happy to see the two Keepers standing guard outside the cell. Im surprised to see Miranda. They let you out? I ask. She nods. I convinced Lewis. The spread of the disease doesnt seem contained to people who were infected, and I told him I needed to talk to Hector. Right, I say. Of course shes the best person to ask him questions. She knows all the right ones. Sergei? She shakes her head. I dont press the issue. Where are Diego and Rosie? Miranda asks. I heard they helped you bring Hector in. Not quite, I say. I fill her in on what happened, and she spends a good part of the story shaking her head. Youre okay? she asks. I still feel the burning where Hector cut me. Im fine, I say. One of the Keepers helped bandage me. She nods. So Mayas still out there? For now, I say. Well find her. I try to inject my voice with an optimism I dont feel. She looks at the door to the cell. Then its a good thing we have him. Are you up for this? She looks back at me, and she looks weary. And far older than Ive ever seen her look before. I have to be. I put my hand on her shoulder and give it a small squeeze. She reaches up to it with her hand and gives it an answering squeeze for a moment. Then she pulls away and enters the cell. I wait outside. Im very bad at waiting, but I dont feel comfortable leaving Miranda without backup. Other than the Keepers, I mean. So I wait. Miranda emerges about an hour later, looking even more tired and worn than when she entered. I look at her, the question plain on my face. She shakes her head. He wouldnt talk. Her voice doesnt break, but its on the verge. Not at all? She meets my eyes and hers are bloodshot. Ben... Go take a break, I say. Close your eyes for a moment. Hes not going anywhere. Ben, time is running out. I know, I say. But you cant do anything here right now. Well figure something else out. She looks about to protest, but I say, Go. Youre no use to anyone if youre dead on your feet. Shes silent for a moment, then she nods. Just a short break. I nod and Miranda shuffles off, an invisible weight pressing down on her. Im considering going in to interrogate Hector myself when Diego and Rosie show up. After Mirandas frustration Im hoping for a win, but then I catch sight of Diegos face. Its rigid. What happened? I ask. Diego glares at Rosie, and Rosie looks quickly away. Uh oh. Maya ... got away. What do you mean, got away? While the Keepers were combing the island for her, she was sneaking onto a ship, the Brightwing, and using it to escape the island. She stole an airship? I ask. Diego nods. How did they not shoot her down? She had valid codes, Diego says. How the hell? I ask. Diego shakes his head and rubs at his beard. She obviously planned this for a while. Who knows what shes been secretly doing over the past weeks? He shoots another glare at Rosie, and she looks like right here is the last place she wants to be. I think back to my run with Maya, to the cacheshe was there to see how everything operatedthe islands network, its infrastructure. All she needed to do was charm or sweet-talk someone, and shed have everything she needed to get a decent-enough lead. Unless... I look at Rosie. I dont see her smile all too often, but right now she just looks miserable. Shes always been one of those people who looks like she belongs everywhere. Until now. I might believe a lot, but I cant bring myself to believe that she set Maya up to escape. Maya was smart enough to figure that out on her own. Doesnt mean Im any less pissed at Rosie. Does the Council know? I ask. Yes, Diego says. Theyre meeting right now to see if we should consider evacuation. With this disease still in play? Theyre scared, Diego says. Another look in Rosies direction. Can you blame them? Even if the Cabal didnt know our location before, they do now. Rosie snaps, whirling on him. You think I wanted this? She throws both arms in the air. She betrayed me, too! Theres a lot of that going around, Diego says. Rosies eyes go wide and she starts to open her mouth, but I interrupt. We dont have time for this, I say. If Mayas gone, then all we have is Hector. And we need to get what we need from him. Did anyone talk to him? Diego asks. Miranda, I say. Only hes not talking. Then maybe we should make him talk, Diego says. Theres something dark and dangerous in his voice. How? I ask. You want to beat on him? Diego looks at me, and theres something chilling in his eyes. Thats exactly what I want to do. I get it. I do. They tortured Diego for days. I bet he has nightmares about it every night. I bet he still feels the pain both from the wounds that havent healed and from the ones that never will. He wants to deal it back. Try to gain back that ground. Try to be the torturer instead. I might feel the same. But... It wasnt that long ago that Captain Danning had me strapped to a table, trying to make me feel like I was drowning. I dont think thats the way to go. Why not? Diego asks. Its what they would do. Its what the Valhallans would do. What they have done. Hes not one of them. No, Diego says. Hes something worse. I agree with him there. And what if he doesnt talk? Or he gives us bad information? Or if you damage him so badly that he dies on us? What then? Diego shrugs. Hes not talking now, so what difference does it make? At least this way we have a shot. He fixes me with a stare. What would you suggest? We make a deal. What? These are manipulators, dealers. We give him something that appeals to him. Some kind of deal that gives him something in return for what we want. Are you fucking crazy? Diegos expression is incredulous. He infected our people, including Sergei, your friend. Mirandas friend. And you want to give him something? Whats all the yelling about, Miranda asks, walking up to us. That was quick, I say. I couldnt, she says. Whats the matter? she asks Diego. Diego shakes his head. Ask Ben. He seems to have lost his mind. Were talking about how we can get Hector to talk, I say. Ive managed to stay calm all this time, but I can feel myself getting angrier the more Diego pushes. Diego wants to torture him. Miranda looks at Diego in surprise. Really? Diego crosses his arms, nods. I think its our best bet. We need information fast. Sergei isnt getting better, and the Council is talking about evacuation, and this disease is still spreading. No, Miranda says. Were not torturing him. Its not right. Fuck whats right, Diego says. Nothing about this is right. We dont have the luxury anymore of thinking in those terms. This is what they would do. If were not willing to use the same tools, then were definitely going to lose. Miranda shakes her head. I would think that youd be the last person to want this. Why? Because they tortured me? They shot Ben, and hes still willing to shoot back at them. How is this different? Because were better than that, she says. If we torture him, how are we different from them? Thats a stupid argument, Diego says. We know what were about. What we want. What we stand for. This is just a tool. For a very specific purpose. Im not even saying to kill him. Just get what we need. No, Miranda says. And you get to decide? Diego says. Im the one researching this disease, she says. Im the only one here who knows what information we need. Well, I think this is bigger than you, Diego says. And I think maybe Lewis will be interested in this. He moves to the door, pauses after opening it. You know Im right. Deep down inside, you know. You just dont want to be the one who does it. So dont. Let me. Then he leaves. Miranda lets out an angry sigh and shakes her head. I turn to Rosie. You were awfully quiet during all that. No opinion? Oh, I have an opinion, Rosie says. I agree with Diego. Only... Yes? I dont want him doing that. Interrogating Hector? She nods. You havent seen him. The nightmares. How it twists him up. Im afraid ... Im afraid that he would lose himself. That he would go too far and then ... not forgive himself. I wont see him go through something like that again. The regret. The punishment. She tilts her chin in the air. I wont. Well, hopefully none of us will have to see that, Miranda says. Although I dont like the thought of Lewis getting involved. We should go talk to him, too, I say. Get ahead of this. It will look better if we can present him other options at the same time rather than after the fact, when hes had time to set his opinions. Good idea, Miranda says. What are our other options? We appeal to them as equals. Convince them to treat us as such. Thats what my gut tells me. You met some of them up on Gastownwhat do you think? Miranda nods. It could work. But it has to be done just right. We push out into the daylight, walking in the direction of Lewiss office. I reach out for Mirandas hand, try to grab it, but she pulls it away and wraps it around her body. Sorry, she says. Its just with Sergei... Her voice catches and she suppresses a sob. Hes not doing well. Well find something out, I say. Miranda sniffs. I almost want Lewis to make us do what Diego wants, she says. If only because it might actually work. Well, after what Rosie said... I break off and look around. Wait, wheres Rosie? A moment later it hits me, and I panic and run back to where were keeping Hector, Miranda on my heels. I burst into the room to catch Rosie punching Hector in the face. When his head lifts back up, a thread of sticky blood drips from his mouth. His face still looks flat, but he smiles a bit. I run and grab Rosie, pull her back. Let me go! No, I say. Im aware that she could probably kick my ass right now, but Im hoping she wont. Hector spits on the ground. Animals, he says. Thinking with your fists, as usual. Thats why youll lose. He spits again. Youre barely a step above Ferals. Miranda moves forward, assessing Hector. An area around his eye and cheek is red, already swelling. And the busted lip. His blood is pooled on the floor. Miranda is staring at it. I get the chills. I know hes clean. That Miranda tested him. But Im just used to staying away from blood. And his is all out in the open. Miranda reaches into a pocket and pulls out a syringe. Miranda, what are you doing? I ask. Help me, she says. Quickly. I dont know what the hell is going on, but this is Miranda and theres no one else I trust more on the planet, so I do what she says. Hold him and roll up his arm. Hector frowns. He squirms a bit, but hes tied to the chair and I hold him firm, rolling up his sleeve. Miranda sticks the syringe into a veinthe mans veins virtually pop from his skinand takes a blood sample. As shes about to pull it out, Hector spits blood into her face. Miranda freezes in surprise. I let his arm go and punch him hard. Miranda moves away, wiping at her face. And I realize what Ive done. Sorry, I say, but I dont know who Im apologizing to. It wont help you, Hector says. Well see, Miranda says. I make sure Rosie comes with us when we leave.  What was that all about? I ask. Miranda is moving quickly, back in the direction of her lab. It suddenly occurred to me when I was looking at his blood that if I were going to send people into a hostile situation with a dangerous disease, that I would try to inoculate them against the disease. Can they do that? I ask. She shrugs. They designed the virus in the first place. It wouldnt be hard to develop some kind of method of inoculation. Not with the techniques they seem to have access to. Okay, what good does that do us? I ask. If he has antibodies in his system, it could give us a better idea of what were dealing with. And it would prove that a vaccine is possible. Will a vaccine help Sergei? Her face darkens. No. It wouldnt help people already infected. But it should prevent more people from getting sick. If I could get one made. Well get the rest of the boffins on it, I say. She nods. Back at the lab, Miranda gets to work, summoning all the boffins, giving them orders, explaining whats happening, what she needs them to do. Its a small bit of hope, even if it does nothing for Sergei. I take the opportunity to talk to Rosie. What the hell were you doing? Trying to get answers, she says. She still has that defiant look in her eyes. You dont know all the questions. You wanted him to talk. I can make him talk. You dont get to make those decisions, I say, feeling my anger rise. Her finger presses against my chest, beneath where my cut is, and the pain sparks. I dont recall voting for you. And last I checked, I lived here first. Youre still a newcomer, Ben. I know you think you can just fly in here and take charge and be a big man, but youre not. Youre just one of many. Youre a fucking guest. I did what I thought was necessary. To get answers. And to keep Diego out of that room. Havent you done enough? I ask. It lands just how I want it to. She practically flinches. She quickly recovers. Next time you grab me like that, you better be prepared to put me down. Noted. She scowls and then walks away. I shake my head. Were falling apart. And this is no doubt what the Cabal wantsus scattered, confused, at each others throats. Were exactly where they want us to be. Lewis finds us a short while later. Diego is with him, and some of Tamoanchans peacekeepers. Wheres Miranda? he asks me when I go to meet him. Shes working, I say. She thinks Hector may already have antibodies in his blood. To protect him from the disease. She thinks she can make a vaccine. Lewis chews on this for a moment, then nods. Good. Very good. I thought youd like that. Have you decided about evacuation? The discussion is still ongoing, he says. Then why are you here? I ask. Diego convinced me that we should get as much information as we can out of the prisoner, as quickly as we can. By any means possible? I ask. He shrugs. Well start easy. Work our way up. Mirandas going to have more questions for him. Well let her know when hes being cooperative. I dont suppose I can convince you otherwise? He smiles at me. No. I hold my hands up as if in surrender. Okay, then. Its your island. I look at Diego. You might want to talk to your sister before you do anything. Theres nothing I need to hear from her right now, he says. I shake my head but turn to go. This will work, Ben, Diego says. Youll see. I hope so, I say. As they open the door to Hectors cell, I feel a sinking sensation in my stomach. This all feels wrong.  Its a bicycle messenger who tells me that Sergei died. He just tells me flat-out, sent by Miranda. And thinking about Miranda makes my heart break in two because I can imagine how shes feeling. I grab a rickshaw to take me to the quarantine house. Shes standing outside, arms wrapped around herself, her face tearstained and puffy. I jump out of the seat and run to her, taking her in my arms, holding her as she sobs and shakes. Its like being shot and stabbed at the same time. Im sad about losing Sergei, I truly am, but Im even more upset by knowing what its doing to Miranda. I lost a father. I know what thats like. Miranda has lost two. I think he was peaceful, she says. In the end. I was able to give him something to help with the pain. Good, I say, stroking her hair. Thats good. She wipes her nose with a handkerchief she pulls from her pocket. I tried so hard, Ben. I tried to fix things. I just ... couldnt. I know, I say, pulling her close again. I know you did everything you could. A moment later, her hand curls up, grips my shirt. I want to kill them, she says, her voice low and throaty. I want to kill them all. I know, I say. Me, too. She sobs again, and I rub her back and wish that there was a way I could fix things. Wish that I could quiet her pain. After the sobs subside, she looks up at me through tear-glazed eyes. He wanted, she says. He wanted you to have the Pasteur. Thats when my own tears come. Summoned up through the vast, numb emptiness Ive been feeling. The Pasteur is Sergeis airship. Its a modest affair, and mostly its been used for scientific research, but ... Sergei gave her to me. Sergei tried to give me my wings back. I nod to her. And smile through the tears. Then I pull her close again, and we hold on to each other, both of us crying. Both of us mourning our friend. Both of us craving vengeance.         TWENTY-ONE FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA I lied to get access to Hector. I know that Lewis had taken him into custody, presumably to beat information out of him, but I didnt think it would work. Call it an educated guess, but I know something about the Cabal from when I met some of their people back on Gastown. They think theyre superior to everyone else. Certainly to people like Lewis and Diego. Hector would see violence as something expected and base. What I told the Council members was that Hector still posted a threat. That we didnt know what his blood might be carrying or what else he might have stashed on the island. That was enough to get them to let me see him (and to prevent others from going in to see him). I showed up with a small kit of syringes, four of them nestled safely inside. They locked me in the room with him. Hectors face was already bruised and scabbed. He sneered at me when he saw me. I was hoping that you would be willing to talk to me, I said. Scientist to scientist. Hector barked a laugh at me. Why? I shrugged. You proved your point. And your new virus seems to be potent. What do you call it? Hector shook his head. Nice try. But Im not telling you anything. I pulled out my first syringe, took a blood sample. He didnt struggle. Didnt fight. That wont help you, he said. Maybe, I said. But I think you will. Youre deluded, he spat. I smiled at him. Then I removed my second syringe. His sneer disappeared when he saw that it already contained blood. Whats that? he asked. Blood from a specimen of ours. Alpha. He went pale. The Feral? My smile widened. Im not supposed to have this here. But I had some samples transported. For our virus test. I moved the syringe to his arm. Now, I said. You are going to give me information on this new disease you created, or else Im going to inject you with this blood. I expect the viral load is quite high. You cant, he said, his voice tinged with hysteria. Oh, I can. The needle tip slid across his skin. Because your disease killed someone very dear to me. Its too late to save him now. But I can make you pay. Wait, he said. Wait. Pleading. Lots of pleading. A small part of me enjoyed it, the power I had in my hand. Ill tell you what you want to know, he said. And he did. He told me how he and Maya were set up at the prison camp, so that they would be taken back with my people, knowing that wed be unlikely to leave them behind. He told me how the location of the prison camp was deliberately given to us so that they could use the island as a testing ground for their new disease. He confirmed that it was an autoimmune disease. Detailed its structure. How did you infect us? Even with the threat of the syringe, he couldnt stop a smile from crawling onto his face. Through the water supply, he said. We engineered it to live in water. I infected one of your wells. I went cold at that. From the Cabals perspective, it was the perfect way to attackwere on an island with limited water resources, and water is something we need. It would also be hard to trace. Was that what was in the syringe you attacked Ben with? I asked. No, he spat. That was just a poison. But there is one more vial. Redundancy. I hid it. He licked his lips. If you let me go, Ill tell you where it is. Do you really think Im going to do that? You need it. To isolate the antigen. He shrugged one shoulder. Ill give it to you. But you have to let me go. Just ... out the door. Thats it. Just give me a chance to get away. I thought about how Maya had gotten away. Out the door might be enough for him. How can I trust you? I asked. Let me take you to it. Once you see it, you let me go. There are guards outside, I told him. Figure out a way to get rid of them. I think that might be a bit beyond me, I said. Youre too important. But... I steeled myself, forcing my face to be steady. This whole time I had wanted to push the syringe into him. Press the plunger down and watch him dread what came next. Savor it. Sergei was dead. I couldnt get him back. But I could maybe help others. Thats what I kept telling myself. Thats what I had to keep telling myself. How about you tell me where the vial is, I said. And if its there, I promise you. On all that is dear to me, I promise that I will walk you out that door myself. He screwed up his face. How can I trust you? I shrugged. You might just have to take a chance, I said. But I give you my promise. I promise on Sergeis life. I will walk you out that door myself. If I find that youre telling the truth, Ill find a way to move the guards, and you can walk through that door. He searched my face, then his eyes narrowed. I could practically see him running the equations in his head. Finally, after what seemed like a very long time, he said, Okay. Then he gave me the location, a tree near the lab, a forked one. He told me the vial was buried at its base, near a large, gnarled root. I left to go look for it, telling the guards Id be back soon. And there it was, exactly where he said it was. I didnt even have to dig very far. I pulled out the tube, intact and filled with liquid. When I returned to the cell, I held the tube out to the Keepers there, one male, one female. Hector gave this up, I said. What is it? the woman asked. It contains the virus, I said. The new one. The male Keeper looked at his partner. I need you to take it to the lab. Us? the man asked. Yes. Its very important. It has to be kept safe. Take it to Lewis if you want. You take it, the woman said to her partner. Keep it safe. And whatever you do, dont break it. The male Keeper looked nervous, his young face covered with apprehension. But he took the vial. Quickly now. He ran off. As soon as he was out of sight, I moved to the door, but before going through, I took the next syringe from my pocket and pressed it into the other Keepers neck. She went down quickly with the dose of tranquilizer I gave her. When I returned to Hector, he looked hopeful. You found it? I did. And youll keep your promise? I will. I moved to him and kept his hands bound, but I untied him from the chair and walked him on stiff legs to the door. Youre making the right decision, he said. It will be better this way. I just nodded back to him. He looked down at the body of the Keeper on the ground outside the door. Then he looked back at me and smiled. I didnt think you had it in you. You dont know me very well, I said. My hands? Hector asked, holding out his bound wrists. I grabbed hold of one of his wrists and undid his bonds, seeing his smile out of the corner of my vision. I matched it with one of my own as I pulled the wrist closer and, with my other hand, depressed the fourth syringe into it. He fell back, rubbing at his hand. What was that? His voice was high and sharp. That poison you meant for Ben. He tried to pull away, to turn and run, but already his legs were growing weak and he fell to the ground, still holding his wrist. You promised. You killed my best friend. As I stood over him and watched him convulse and tremble, he looked up at me with wide eyes. Youll never make it, he gasped. Neither will you, I said.         TWENTY-TWO They confine Miranda to her house as punishment, but they let me in to see her, which is a relief after everything thats happened. I sit down in a nearby chair, just looking at her, not knowing what to say. Her eyes are red from crying, though because of Sergei or what had just happened or both, I dont know. Tell me what happened, I say at last. I needed to know, she says. Her voice is tight, strangled. I needed to know how to fix this thing. I nod. Okay. Did he Yes, she says. I have a sample, now. Ive sent a messenger to Clay. If things work out, we should be able to create a vaccine. Thats great, I say, trying to inject some feeling of excitement into my voice. Then you can start inoculating people? Anyone who hasnt been infected, she says. Theres something in her tonesomething self-recriminating or self-mocking. It wont help the dozen or so people suffering, though. I grab her hand. Dont feel bad for what happened, I say. He deserved everything he got. Look what hes done to us. She meets my eyes. I know. But I still crossed a line. Miranda, please dont beat yourself up over this. Thats just it, Ben. She lets go of my hand, stands up, and starts pacing behind her table. I dont feel bad about it. I would do it again. The words chill me a bit. I know they shouldntthat I might have done worse in her positionbut they still do. This is Miranda. Then whats the problem? She scratches a piece of the wooden desk near one corner. Did they deal with the well? she asks. Yes, I say. After figuring out which one got everyone sick, they shut it down. Which is going to put a strain on the other water sources. The island doesnt have an abundance of freshwater. And it hasnt rained for days. I just dont want any more people to get sick. Not until we can get this vaccine out. A lot of people used that well. I see her hand clench into a fist. Miranda, what is it? She shrugs. I dont know, Ben. The fact that we lost so many people. That one of them Her voice cracks, but she gets it under control. Was Sergei. The fact that I just killed the man that did it? Theres something else wrong, I say. I dont know how I knowits just a feelingbut I know. She looks up at me, surprised. Then quickly looks away. I wasnt going to tell you. Tell me what. I stand up and move toward her. Grab the hand that was picking at the table. Whats going on? She looks up at me, her face drained of emotion. She just looks tired. Beat up and tired. Then she laughs for a moment, putting her free hand up to her mouth. Sorry. Its just almost comical, all of this. Miranda... I have the disease, Ben. Enigma. I feel the blood drain from my face. Im infected, she says.  The irony of the situation is that Clay gets the vaccine going around the time that Miranda starts to decline. And while shes tired and weak, she insists on continuing to study the Enigma virus. Its like shes racing it now, trying to find a cure before it kills her. Three more of the infected people died in the last daythe carpenter and two of the boffins. The rest of Mirandas people have shifted their focus fully to Enigma. I managed to convince Lewis to let Miranda work from the house, so that she can continue her research, and so that she can be more comfortable. As a result, its now covered in microscopes and papers and samples, and a steady stream of boffins and messengers are in and out of it all day. I sit on my chair, and Miranda sits propped up in her bed. Im proud of the bed. They burned what Sergei had slept on, so I bartered, rather aggressively I might add, for a mattress. Right now its coming in handy, since its where Miranda spends most of her time. She looks paler than shes ever been. Even more than when we had fallen from the Cherub into the ocean, cold water pooling in the bottom of our raft. Tired, too. Dark circles ring her eyes, which are bloodshot. Her face looks hollow. I try to get her to eat, but its hard. Weve mostly been sticking to a simple broth that she can manage to get down. Shes fighting on two fronts, really. One with her mind, trying to find a way to cure this disease, and the other with her body. One of them seems to be a losing battle. Im pinning all my hopes on the other. And yet Im just sitting here, doing nothing, and its driving me crazy. Mirandas eyes flick up to me and she smiles. Hows the book? she asks. I look down at the worn paperback in my hands. I conjure up a smile to flash back at her. Not bad, I say. Its something of a lie. What I have read is pretty decentits a thrillerbut Ive been rereading the same few pages for most of the last hour, unable to get my brain to focus on it. What the fuck am I going to do? Stay with her, the voice in my head says. Try to make her smile. Be her strength when hers falters. I nod my head. I didnt stay with my father when he Faded.I couldnt. I ran. But Im not going to run from Miranda. No more running. No more flying. This last thought would normally have stopped me cold. Chilled me. Made me want to fight or do anything to get back into the sky. But while I brace myself for that feeling, it doesnt come. For the moment, at least, Im content to be right here. On the ground. In fact, theres no place Id rather be. A lot going on in there, Miranda says, tapping her head. Theres a lot going on everywhere, Miranda. I suppose. She wraps her arms around herself and shivers. You cold? I ask. She nods, her face all weariness. I get up, move the book aside, and gently lower myself onto the bed. I take her in my arms. Is this better? I ask. Much, she says. We lay there like that for a while. Silent. Warm. Connected. After Miranda drifts off to sleep (she sleeps much more these days), I get up to stretch my legs, taking care not to disturb her. Im hot from shared body heat and the air in the small place feels close, so I go outside, inhaling the fresh air and the scent of the sea. Tamoanchan feels quiet. Dead. People stay indoors these days, fearing the disease despite Mirandas vaccine. Fearing the unknown. The next threat. Waiting for the sky to fall.  I may have made up my mind to stay with Miranda, but the truth is I feel useless. It was almost better when I had Hector to worry about. He was alive. Tangible. Something in the real world that I could focus on. Put my efforts toward. This thing? I cant touch. I excuse myself during one Mirandas conferences with the other boffins and go for a walk. After wandering for a while, I end up at the rabbis place. Im about to sink onto a bench when he comes up to me and puts an arm around me. I am sorry, Ben, he says. I heard about your friend. Sergei, was it? Yes, I nod. Something heavy and thick is stuck in my throat, and my limbs feel leaden. The rabbi scrutinizes me. Ben? My breath comes fast and shallow. Its Miranda, I say. Shes sick. Oh, no, Rabbi Cohen says. Ben. I am so very sorry. Shes fighting it, of course. Because thats Miranda, but... I squeeze my hands into fists, and I feel like I want to punch something. Im scared, I say. I know, he says. Of course you are. You love her, dont you? Yes, I gasp. And of course now I can say it. When she might be taken away from me. Have you told her? he asks. I look at him. No, I say. I havent been able to. Maybe now is a good time, he says. I cant make any promisesand what happens will be what happensbut love can sometimes accomplish small miracles. Youre right. I nod to myself. Hes right. I should go. Now. I will pray for you both, the rabbi says. And, Ben. Im always here if you need me. Even if Im not. Thanks, Rabbi. I hurry back to the house, and to Miranda.  Shes talking to two boffins when I walk in. She looks up at me for a moment, a small smile on her face, then returns to them. Can we have a moment? I ask. Ben, Miranda says. Were in the middle of something. Its important, I say. Okay. She looks at the boffins. Give us a minute? After they leave, I sit down on the bed next to her. I need to talk to you, Miranda. She smiles. I got that impression. I know youre dealing with a lot right now, and I dont want to add to that, but Ive been thinking. About, well, lots of things. The future. The past. Pull it together, Ben. Ive been thinking about what I want. About what I can do. I was worried that maybe I couldnt be happy on the ground. Or in one place. I know, she says. She pats my hand. This isnt going the way I thought. I just think ... things have changed. Im here now. Youre here. This can work. Ben... Hang on. I ... its just that when I picture it all in my head, or when I used to, it was just me, alone, here. But Ive come to realize that Im not alone. No, Ben, youre not. I know that now. And I also know that it makes all the difference. I think that this is what I want. Being here. Now. Im glad, Ben. My heart is hammering in my chest. My mouth is incredibly dry. Miranda I need to say something, she says, interrupting me. Because I dont know how much time we have left and, well, I need to say it. Okay... Youve probably sensed that I was a little distant. Hesitant. Yes. Well, I was having a hard time reconciling things. What things? I ask, confused. Your past. What happened with Malik. Oh. I slip my hand away. I guess I just had this image of you, who you are now, and I didnt like being reminded of who you were back then. I feel my stomach turning. But its only because ... because Im really proud of who you are now. And I like the man you are. With me. Miranda And I understand, now, having to make hard decisions. I cant judge you for those things. I wasnt there. She grabs my hand again. Im sorry, she says. Its okay, I say. I want to tell you something. I need to Im interrupted by the sound of an explosion somewhere outside. Miranda looks at me in alarm, and I shake my head. Then another explosion, followed by the sounds of gunfire. Wait here, I say. I run to the door. The two boffins are waiting outside. Looking up. In the sky, coming off the coast, is a formation of enemy airships, guns blazing. Tamoanchan is being invaded.         TWENTY-THREE An attack? Miranda asks. Her voice sounds high and thin. I nod wearily. They failed at quiet, so now theyre trying loud. How many? she asks. Enough, I say. She shakes her head. I think we should think about getting you out of here, I say. You want to run? No. I dont want to run. But Im not going to risk your life in this attack. Weve come too far for that. Ben, she says, her voice small, something wet in the back of her throat. She beckons me closer. I move to her, and she grabs my hands. Hers are cracked and dry, one fingernail bloody where she bit it down too far. Ben. A pause. Im no closer to cracking this thing than I was a week ago. Thats why I want to get you out of here. Give you time to do more research. She squeezes my hands. She feels so weak. I dont think I have much time left. It takes a moment for the meaning to sink in. And by her tone, I know shes being honest. Shes always straight with the science. She probably has calculated the likelihood of, well, everything. Shes run the odds, and they arent in her favor. I instinctively lean back, trying to pull away from what shes saying. I feel numb. My whole body feels numb. The woman I love just told me shes going to die soonI should be sad or I should cry or I should curl into a ball at the news, and yet I just feel ... nothing. Hollow inside. Ice. Are you sure? is what I manage to say. She nods. A tear spills from one eye. Still, the ice. Im not going to abandon my people. My work. Not now. Just to die somewhere far away. Not while people are out there risking their lives for me. I nod. So Im staying, she says. Then so am I, I say. You should really be up there, she says. Maybe not shooting at them, but ... you could fly circles around them. I want to be here, I say. With you. Besides, neither the Dumah nor the Pasteur would be any good in a fight. She shrugs. Then I guess thats good for both of us. I lie down again with my arms around her. I cant fly, and I cant fight, and its possible that some kind of bomb or gunfire will catch us here, together, as we wait to find out whats going to happen. But I can be there for Miranda. I can spend however long she has left with her. And thats what Im going to do.  The screams rouse me from the light slumber I fell into. My head jerks up, and I slide out of bed, reaching for my coat, my right hand finding the handle of the revolver. Miranda looks up, her eyes glazed from sleep. Stay here, I say. I reach into one of the coats pockets and pull out the automatic I had once lent to Maya, pass it to Miranda. Keep this close. She nods. Ill be right back. Be careful, Ben, Miranda says. I open the door quietly, slipping out into the afternoon air. The wind carries the smell of smoke to me, though I have no idea of determining where its coming from. I hear another scream. Then another. A woman and a man. I run off toward the sounds. Tamoanchans streets, at least in this part of the island, are arranged into grids. I pass one intersection, then another. Then I catch sight of them. A man clutching at a bloody arm, his sleeve ragged and torn. A woman, close-cut hair of grey, supporting him. They stumble toward me. I move toward them and then catch sight of something big, moving fast. Coming at all of us. What they were running from. I focus on it, and the numbness Ive been feeling wavers under a sudden flush of adrenaline through my system. Its a Feral, bounding toward us. But not any ordinary Feral. This one is large, thick with muscles that bunch and unbunch as it races across the street on all fours. I flash back suddenly to something I saw when I was moving through Gastowns helium plant. A Feralhuge and muscled like this onethat they fed prisoners to. The memory shutters, pushed down by the need for action. I draw the revolver and fire. I aim for a leg and hit, but the creature still comes on, pumping its grotesquely muscled limbs. I fire again, and the second shot takes it in the chest. The third misses. The next hits its arm. Still it comes, and its now just moments away from me. I hope the man and woman have kept moving. Somehow forcing my brain to take control, I fire again for the wounded leg. I hit it, and the beast tumbles, sliding against the ground, and I fire one more shot into its head. It stops moving. As I start to shake, the fear and adrenaline still rushing through me, I notice a few things. One, the Feral is naked. Dark hair and, now, blood are the only things on its skin. Two, it took me six shotssixto take this Feral down. Three, I realize Im hearing more screams. I get it, then. The Cabal has been breeding mutant Ferals. I know that. They are attacking Tamoanchan on two frontsin the air with their ships and on the ground with the Ferals. We are well and truly fucked. I catch sight of more people running through the streets as I quickly reload the revolver. I grab a man with tear-stained cheeks and a look of horror on his face. I need you to go find a Keeper, I say. Tell them they need to organize a force to come defend this side of the island. The man nods to me, then goes running off, but Im not sure if hell actually do it. Peacekeepers, I think, shaking my head. Theres no peace to keep anymore. I run back for Mirandas place, and when I run into her room, she has the automatic pointed at me. Nice form, I say. I didnt know it was you, she says. Exactly, I say. You just keep doing that. I move to a box I stashed in the other room. Call back over my shoulder. Its bad out there, Miranda. Theyve dropped mutant Ferals on the island. Like the one I told you about back in the helium plant. What? she asks. I can barely hear her. Here? Yes, I say. I open the box that contains my spare ammunition and I load my pockets. All of themcoat, pants, the two chest pockets on my shirt. I take out another automatic and stuff that, too, into my pocket. Then I grab the shotgun thats also nestled inside, adding ammunition for the two new weapons. Mirandas eyes widen as I move back to her room. That bad? I nod. I lean in and kiss the top of her head. Stay here. Keep the gun. Im going to barricade you in. What? Luckily, the place doesnt have any windows. I dont want any Ferals getting in. If I can pile some things in front of the door, you should be safe. But then you wont be able to get in. Ill get in once this all is over. Once we beat them back. And if we cant? I meet her eyes. Then its a moot point. She nods. I grab my scarf and my hat and my glasses. I place a gloved hand on the side of Mirandas face. When I get back, well have a long talk. She raises an eyebrow. Oh, yeah? Yeah. I kiss her dry lips. Ill even tell you my middle name. She smiles. Deal. Good, I say. Now sit tight. Ill be back later. With my free hand, I drag a box outside, also a chair and whatever loose furniture I can move. I shut the door to Mirandas house and pile as much as I can against it. It wouldnt keep out a determined Feral, but they will be chasing the moving targets, the ones they can see. They have no reason to know that Mirandas inside. At least, I hope they dont. Once Im sure its reasonably secure, I move down the street. Toward the Ferals, not away.  The streets of Tamoanchan are pretty simple affairs, dirt paths cleared of grass and debris, suitable for foot or rickshaw traffic. Houses or shops lining up on either side. Theyve even gone so far as to put in a few parks. Theyre mostly areas where the natural foliage has been left untouched, but unlike the rest of the world, overgrown and overcome by vegetation, here its carefully groomed. On any given day, you can hear sellers hawking their wares, people stopping to have conversations with their neighbors, even laughter. Theres that low hum of humanity that usually, for me at least, brings a sense of comfortthat heres a place where people have come together, survivors looking to build something. That hum has been replaced with cries of terror, screams, panicked noise, and the sound of weapons discharging. Above us the drone of shipsenemy and alliedthickens the air. Down here on the ground, gunshots occasionally rip through the daylight. The smell of smoke filters through the air. Im crossing an intersection when a large shape leaps toward me. I whirl and fire the shotgun at the blur of its body, and it moves away from the blast. Another of the mutated Ferals. As it turns back to me, I see this one is female, though its breasts are lost in the mass of muscle on its chest. It roars at me and lowers into a crouch. I raise the shotgun, but before I can fire, gunshots come from the side street. The Feral turns, bounds toward the shots. I see blood leaking from at least one gunshot. I run after it. If it comes into contact with whoever shot it, the Bug could spread. I fire, running, and one of my shots hits the thing, Im sure of it, but it barely slows. I see ahead of me a Keeper, rifle out, firing at the Feral. Im behind it, firing at it. Its almost on her. I stop, aim for the leg, and fire my last shell into the thing. I hit what Im aiming for, and it stumbles long enough for the Keeper to get a shot in its head. I rush forward to her. Did you get any blood on you? I search for any splatter. No, she says. It was too far away. Thank God, I say. I shot at it so many times, she says, her face full of panic. The two of us barely brought it down. I dont think they feel pain, I say. I grab her and meet her eyes. Hey, I need you to do something for me. What? I need you to find a rickshaw, and I need you to get back to the Council headquarters. See who you can find. We need more Keepers here. All of the Keepers were called to report to the eastern side, to help with the anti-aircraft efforts. Thats because they dont know whats happening here. They need to know. Need to know these things are attacking. Can you do that? She looks blank for a moment. Then nods. Yes. Good. Now go find a rickshaw. And keep alert. There are more of these things. How many? she asks. Too many, I say. Now go quickly. Bring whatever help you can. What are you going to do? she asks. Whatever I can, I say.  I loop back around to where Miranda is because I just want to content myself that the house is okay. Which it is. As strong as these Ferals are, I dont think they can get inside. But Im not completely sure, so at least checking gives me a small bit of peace of mind. I hope Mirandas awake and still has that automatic. Then I hear more gunfire and I head toward it. What are you doing, Ben? My hidden voice says. Youre running toward danger. But what else can I do? Three people surround one of the mutants. Two have rifles and one a pistol, and theyre unloading into it. The Feral is covering itself with its massive arms as shot after shot tears into it. And as I move closer, reloading, they move in on the Feral. It slumps forward. Then erupts into a chaotic flailing, arms swinging, legs kicking. One of the people goes flying into a nearby house, colliding with a sickening crunch. With the other hand, the Feral grabs another of the people, drawing it close, sinking teeth into the persons face. All I can see are the eyes around the scarf and hat, then everything is red. I move forward, firing with the shotgun, aiming for the creatures head. Once. Twice. Shot explodes into the things skull. At least that seems the same as a humans. Not as protected by thick muscle. It falls to the ground, missing the top part of its head. The person without a face is dead, and the one that hit the wall isnt moving. But the third person is writhing on the ground, a deep wound in her side. She looks up at me, as if to plead. And here it is, one of those moments. Because I cant do anything to save her, and she may just be infected by the Bug. These Ferals may be mutated, but theyre still Ferals. I think about shooting her, but she may survive. Hold tight, I say. Help is coming. It might be a lie. I hope its not a lie. I turn around, fish out a knife from my pocket, lay it on the ground within her reach. If things get bad, I say. Then I keep on moving.         TWENTY-FOUR More screams. More gunfire. To the east I see a smoke trail climb into the sky, see an airship take fire on its nose. Score at least one for Tamoanchan. When I round the corner, I see a mutant bent over a body. Its pulling out entrails, stuffing them into its mouth. It looks up at me. I level the shotgun at it, aiming for the head. Im pulling the trigger when I hear the growl behind me. Instinctively, I move to the side and my shot goes wide just as the Feral behind me tries to swing at me. Fuck me. Two of them. I unload the shotgun on the one closest to me, then, when that goes dry, I drop it and pull out my pistols. The revolver is in my right hand, the automatic in my left, and I aim one at each of them, firing one at a time. Left. Right. Left. Right. Until I realize Im wasting ammunition on poor aiming. I back away. The one that I shot with the shotgun moves to his friend and, feeling outnumbered, I run. I barrel down the street, my breath loud and fast, and Im sure both of them are behind me. I need to figure out a way to get the advantage. Especially since their legs are stronger than mine. I weave in and out of streets, cutting around houses, hoping that the quick movements will increase my lead. Im afraid to look behind me. Dont look behind yourself, you idiot. I hear a growl behind me, and I dive to the side just as the Feral pounces on where I used be. Ignoring my aching body, I pull my pistols and fire at the thing, unloading on its head with both pistols. It goes down as the pistols both click on empty. And I look up into the other ones face. This one is male. Dark-skinned. Muscles bulge everywhere I can see. It moves toward me, spit dripping from its face. And I got rid of my knife. Then I hear someone say, Eat this! and I look up to see Rosie on the other side of the street, a weapon in her hands. Next to her is Diego in a rickshaw. Then a vapor trail shoots from the weapon and suddenly the Feral is exploding and I feel heat and smoke lick over me. I cover my face, and when I look again, the Ferals a burning mess of meat. Diego and Rosie come over to me and help me to my feet. I am so happy to see you. I look at Rosie. Both of you. How did you find me? Someone came looking for help. Said the crazy ship captain sent her. And you thought of me? Diego shrugs. Who else? Nice weapon you have there, I say. We brought one for you, Diego says. He hands me the long cylinder. Theyve been using them against the ships, but we thought they might be of use here. I cant use it with my arm. Ill be glad to, I say. Ben... Diego says, shaking his head. I know, I say. We just have to try. He nods. I have an idea, I say. If your arm isnt working too well, how are your legs? Great, he says. Good, then what say you give me a ride? He raises an eyebrow but doesnt say anything. Can you find another rickshaw? I ask Rosie. Probably. Good. Then try to get one and meet us at the little park on the east side. Okay, she says. And be careful. She looks at me, then at Diego. You too. I nod to her. Then I climb into the back of the rickshaw. Lets go, I say. Diego pedals off.  Rosie arrives at the park a short while after us, rickshaw and all. Youre going to have to draw them out, I say. But you should be okay on the rickshaw. That way you can outpace them. But you have to be careful. Stick to the streets. Otherwise theyll have you. I know this place, Ben, she says. I know. Thats why you have to go first. She frowns. What are you going to do? Follow you. I heft the anti-aircraft launcher to make my point. Her eyes widen. Something crosses over her face. Some expression I cant identify. Okay, lets go. Dont forget to ring your bell, I say. What? It will attract their attention. Rosie nods, then she takes off, pedaling up and down the streets. Diego stays close behind, but not too close. Then the first Feral sees or hears her and starts bounding after her. We catch sight of it and stay right behind. Watching the thing run behind her, I can see its all muscle. An engineered killing machine. We barrel toward an intersection, and I yell out, Left! Rosie banks to the left and I fire the launcher, which bucks against my chest. The explosive rips through the air and into the Feral, exploding it into pieces. Nice one, Diego says. Only two more shots left, I say. Lets make them count. We take off again, and Diego holds the rickshaw steady as Rosie takes the lead. This time she rings her bell more furiously, trying to attract whatever Ferals she can. Another takes the bait, and again I have her turn off as I fire at the thing. The shot is low, instead hitting the ground, but it throws the Feral up into the air and onto a nearby house. Rosie returns with her pistol to finish it off. One last shot to go. Lets head back east a bit, see if we cant draw any out. So Rosie heads that way and Diego pedals behind her and I load the last shell into my launcher. We could actually win this, I start to think. We just need to coordinate. But I see that the ships above us are larger now, closer to us. At the moment, I cant tell if theyre theirs or ours. Then Diego starts pumping his legs as another Feral tears out after Rosie. Im becoming aware of a dark shape moving above us, but I cant really take my eyes off of Rosie and the Feral. Trying to hold steady, I raise the launcher to my shoulder. And as Im lining up the shot, the world breaks apart around me.  For a moment, Im not sure what happened. But Im thrown from the rickshaw and the sky tumbles above me. I lose sight of Diego and God knows where Rosie is. A moment later, I smell the fire, and the stink of some kind of explosive. Did I accidentally misfire the launcher? I think. My ears are filled with a high-pitched buzz, and thats all I can hear. I call out for Diego and Rosie, but I cant even hear my own voice. I manage to push myself up and finally catch sight of Diego. Hes lying on the ground nearby, the rickshaw is turned over next to him. And the Feral appears, moving toward him. I try to call out, but how would he hear me? Im trying to get to my feet, trying to find one of my pistols, when Rosie runs into view. She doesnt appear to be armed, but she kicks the Feral in the head, a flying kick with all of her weight behind it. The thing has a heavily muscled neck, but it snaps back from the force all the same. The Feral is stunned, but it throws both arms around Rosie, pinning her arms to her sides and restraining her. Hes going to bite her, I think, and then Im running toward them, and I remember that my reloaded revolver is in the thigh holster and I pull it out and start firing into the Ferals back. It turns to this new assault, letting Rosie slip away, and as it starts moving toward me, she sweeps its leg and aims an elbow, with all her weight behind it, into the things back. It goes down, and without stopping I walk toward it, firing at its head and shoulders. Once, twice, three times until it stops moving. Rosie immediately moves to Diego, who is now stirring. I kneel beside them and reload to help cover them. What the hell was that explosion? I ask. I can barely hear my own voice. But the answer comes a moment later as I scan the town to the east. A large area, a block or two at least, is now a burning, smoking mess. A moment later, I realize what direction that is. And even though Diego and Rosie are here, I start running. Because the fire is coming from the direction of Mirandas house.  I dont know what Im seeing. The place where the house is, that whole part of the street, is burning. I see the wreckage of several buildings. But I cant get close to it with the smoke and the heat of the fire. Even with my scarf, Im coughing from all the smoke. Miranda. I push my way through the fire where I can, covering my face. My skin. I get farther up the street. Just ahead is the house. Just ahead is... What used to be the house is just a mess of kindling. The ceiling is gone, the walls little more than broken sticks. Fire rages in its center, sending thick gouts of smoke into the air. Miranda! I call. Maybe she got out. Maybe shes somewhere nearby. Except you barricaded her in. Miranda! I double over, coughing, dizzy from the heat, and sink to my knees. This cant be happening. This isnt happening. A moment later, I feel hands on me, pulling me back, out of the smoke, out of the fire. Im lowered to the ground. Diego coughs above me. Rosie is next to him. What are you trying to do? he asks. Miranda, I say. Miranda was... Oh, God, Rosie says. She looks at Diego and then back at me. Theres sympathy there, but I want to tell her that its okay. This isnt happening. Miranda cant have been in there. She cant have been. Miranda! Shes gone, Ben, Diego says. He puts an arm around me. Im sorry, Ben. Shes gone. No! I say. Shes not gone. Shes just ... shes just... Shes gone. Oh my God. Shes gone. What am I going to do? What do I do? I climb to my feet. Shes gone. And I cant be here anymore. I was here because of Miranda, and shes not here. I have to go. Where are you going? Diego asks. I have to get out of here, I say. Im sorry. I have to get back up in the air.  I run for the western airfield. The Dumah is there, I know. She will get me back into the air. She will take me away from... Miranda. I push thoughts of her aside. There will be time for that later. Time and alcohol and the comfort of the air. Its all I can think of right now. Getting back. Going back. There is no back. It doesnt matter. I run. Im aware that any second a Feral might find me. Might jump out of the shadows and bite my face off. Somehow that doesnt scare me as much as it used to. My body hurts and my lungs hurt as I suck in air and my eyes are blurry with tears, but I keep running. Up the hill to the airfield. Any second now, Ill see the ocean off the western side of the island. And soon Ill be flying over it, away from Ferals and raiders, and Ill be back in the air where I belong. As I crest the hill, I look down on the ocean. And my steps falter. A large shape sits on the water. A ship. A military ship. The Phoenix. Already as I look, the Dumah is in the sky, moving toward the ship. Mal is here. On Tamoanchan. He found us. Miranda. There is no back. The fight leaves me then. My battered and abused body sinks down to the ground, on my knees, and I stay that way for a while. Not praying, but almost prone. Just trying not to think anymore. Not to feel. If I could spread wings and fly away, I would. But gravity has me in its grip and I cant seem to get free. People move toward me. I ignore them. Then I hear a voice. Benjamin. I look up into Mals face. We have some unfinished business.
