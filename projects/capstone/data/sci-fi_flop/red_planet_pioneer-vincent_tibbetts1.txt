Droplet The firm was a cesspool filled with the disturbed particulates of lies and deceit.The murky waters had everyone fighting the same fight in just getting a little breathing room.He was different from the others operating in this sump because he was willing to go further than most just to save himself.Deep within his person hinged a belief, it was based on the feeling he was better than they were and he searched for opportunities that would help hammer this point home.Xavier Pentagrass was an ambitious young man.The trimmed sleek suits he wore were meant to cut a path through this place.To accompany the sharpness of his attire he developed a personality that was like adding a serrated edge to a knife.The staff knew better than to get between him and what he wanted.Those waters often turned turbulent, so they knew to steer clear of any project he was on, or as it was noted of late, the pitch for colonizing Mars.He was standing on an elevated platform with a panel of people seated directly behind him.They had been assembled as the council to his efforts.This entire setup was considered a one shot deal, so the room was laid out to his exact specifications.Everything needed to be perfect, the seating, the lighting, the placement of the panel, the reading of his entire presentation, right down to the folds in the napkins.He stood near his perch with eyes closed, keeping a vigil unto himself, refusing to utter a single solitary thing until the room began to quiet down and he felt he had their complete and undivided attention.Harnessing his mental energies, he chose instead to combat the things trying to kill them, and find a way to merge those clamoring considerations to go in one direction.He perfected his craft using a series of mental exercises to help him stay focused at crucial times just like these, concentrating on a vision to help him gather his thoughts.The vision he preferred channeled these speculations into beads of moisture gathering under a large granite ledge.At first the exact location of this outcropping was unimportant, but as time went on and he continued to use this exercise, he built an entire world around the protrusion.It jetted out from a steeply sloped mountain high above a jungle lair.The granite prominence could have easily been mistaken for a massive step, a launching point, the stepping stone for a Norse God to leap into the heavens and return to their home high above.It was underneath this ledge where his mental energies condensed, gained focus and direction, convincing him to let go and watch his pitch fly.His focal point for this was unshakeable.There was just too much old money in that room for him to be any other way.His firm had placed a great amount of trust within him to speak in front of these venture capitalists.Yet in the back of his mind, he knew he was the only logical choice for the job.Who else were they going to get from within the company that had his qualifications?No one there had a profile or even a resume that could come close to comparing with his.The scar he had on the back of his head was all the evidence they would ever need for how far he was willing to take these things, that scar signified the ultimate commitment to their corporate philosophies.He wasted none of his opportunities, diving in with relish at any chance for advancement.The implant they had installed in his head was a prototype and literally rested atop his cerebellum.It was there to enhance his free flowing thoughts and gave him access to a wealth of knowledge he never knew existedthis was impressive in its own right, but if he didnt utilize it correctly, all his efforts would be lost.The last thing he wanted to be was the guy at the cocktail party who spewed out endless droves of useless information in a feeble attempt at trying to make an impression.That was a specialized conversation spun verbally to bring a showy cognizance to its owner.He wanted something more out of his life than to be a mental carnival barker.He considered these things demeaning to the chances he had taken.That wasnt to say he didnt have his fair share of problems.At times the implant would direct where his thoughts would travel, leaving his minds eye to stare unblinking into rather bothersome places.This was the power the droplet exercise had in helping him move ahead.His doctors recommended he do something to help harness all these new phrenic energies.This exercise enabled him to project his mental prowess over things in the room, from the ticking of the wall mounted clock to the shifting of ice melting in their beverage tubs and the subtle squeaking of all those leather bound chairs languidly swiveling with their heavy suitors.He knew he needed to be at one with all of those things so he had a better idea of how their energy could help him.He pictured himself a liquid sphere, balanced and at one with the steady state of energy all around him.He was solid in his belief, but capable of moving, and as a water droplet he could hang there, defying the tug of gravity until he was ready to let go.He felt the moment and slowly opened his eyes.If there is one word to describe the monumental colonization effort happening right now on Mars, it has to be that of resiliency.This quality touches everything they send there, from the armada of ships, to the biospheres taking shape on the Martian landscape.There are countless people who have sacrificed long hours on assembly lines, dedicating themselves to making the program they are on their lifes work.Every person who has put their hands on this project has done so in support of the colonists who have taken the long and arduous journey to get there.Every one of these people want to see more then just flags and footprints upon another world.They have climbed aboard those ships with their hopes and dreams, committed in the belief of staying there.The one common thread throughout this entire process has been resiliency.Xavier knew deep down there were problems with investing in a place like Mars, and they didnt rear their ugly head until those colonists actually got to the Red Planet.That was when the scheduled timelines for getting things done collapsed in upon itself.There seemed to be delays in everything they attempted, from launches to the assembly of their biospheres, from mining to manufacturing, even the reports they filed had an inherent delay in getting back to the people of Earth.All of it was unacceptable to anyone looking to invest in this process.Those vicious cycles were preventing the profits from raining down upon their investors.Regardless of these glaring problems, everyone knew two worlds were better than one, especially when it came to making money.That was why every one of those old men was in that room.It would follow then that the individual who would invest in a startup venture on Mars must also exhibit the same tough characteristics those resilient entities have displayed.They survive there now because they have weathered the storms of misfortune.No one wishes for failure, but the individual investing in this venture would be remiss in not planning for the rainy day.We should not wander out into the calm without the protection of at least an umbrella, especially if our days were to turn cloudy and grey.Xavier had spent plenty of time studying the dossiers they had prepared on each of the investors in attendance.He studied their characteristics and tendencies, their educational backgrounds and the extent of their altruistic behaviors.He went over and over these materials until he was acquainted with how these men thought.It was a trying study, but anything a person ever wanted in life was always a series of difficult trials.If one planned accordingly though, one could dictate the pace and direction of the race, just as his last statement had intended to show.So for him, there was no surprise as to who the first person to chirp up at this meeting.Jeb Wentworth was a conservative old man who was notorious for the look of skepticism he would get on his face anytime someone struck up a business conversation.It served him well in making decisions about his money and forced people pitching a venture to shoot straight with him or be shown the door.There were no second chances with Jeb.Those who didnt cut it with him were forever labeled a huckster.A perplexed look followed by that of disgust were usually the last expressions anyone every saw on Jeb as they were shown the door.Xavier saw the signs beginning to form on Jeb Wentworth now.Weve all read the proposal Mr.Pentagrass.I think I speak for quite a few people here in the room when I say its one thing to stand up there and try to sell investors on a potential venture for profit, and its quite another to actually put the thing into practice.You made us all forsake the comfort of our homes and offices.You had us come all the way out here and for what?To listen to some damn pep rally?I dont need to be inspired to invest my money.I need cold hard facts and I dont need them to be spread like chicken feed.Jeb stood up to leave.This caught the attention of everyone in the room.He leaned onto the table, placing his knuckles onto the surface.From everything Xavier had read about Jeb, this last move was his tell that he indeed was getting ready to leave them.So here are some cold hard facts for you Mr.Pentagrass.There are entire countries that have bankrolled this colonization effort.Even if we pulled all of our money together from everyone in this room and dumped it behind whatever it is you are trying to sell us, those numbers would not come close to what those countries have put into their colonization efforts.With that being said, I have a limited amount of investment capital and it matches my patience.Xavier had to tip his hat to Mr.Wentworth, even though he was ready for Jebs skepticism, his technique still had a crushing effect on him.It also forced everyone in the room to pump their brakes.This kind of disruption usually had pitchmen spilling out all over the room like the riders of a toboggan thrown from their sled.In spite of all this Xavier felt himself up for the challenge.He knew he needed to refute what had just been said, but in such a way as to have the appearance of not directing his comments solely at Wentworth.That was just another trap Jeb had thrown out into the room.If this turned into an argument then there wouldnt be much left for him to sell.On the surface Mars seems to be the kind of investment only an elderly gentlemen would make, someone who is coming to the end of their years and is trying to reach out and touch immortality.This is the Mars most of you know when presented with an investment opportunity.The one where future generations reverently murmur the inscribed names of investors from some polished obelisk.That isnt the Mars I am here to sell you.This planet for all intensive purposes has unlimited financial potential, as the colonization process grows, so does the window for this opportunity.I am sure most of you have heard through the media outlets about the start up of mining operations on the Red Planet.They have reported unearthing vast deposits of Deuterium, the value of this commodity is a matter of public record and the Exchanges here on Earth have reacted favorably to its extraction.The mining of this ore will revolutionize the industry on both worlds, and the investors who have so patiently waited for this moment will now reap those rewards.We here now have such an opportunity before us.What has been presented to me by this government, and the reason why our firm has put together this meeting, has us mining a field rich with opportunities, and more importantly opportunities that have not been announced to the general public.Even as we are speaking here, I am certain the government will be allowing for a few more meetings to take place like this one.The first single consortium willing to step up to the plate and commit to the government will be the ones to reap the rewards.Xavier had a knack for being able to tell the interest level of each and every potential investor.The look they got on their faces led him either out the door or to their wallets.When they were staring at him, as they were now, hanging on his every word, he knew they were his to lose.Much like the batter of a baseball game hanging on the one pitch that would allow them to win the game, all he needed to do was put a big fat cookie out over the plate and let them hit it out of the park.The men in this room wouldnt settle for anything less and Xavier thrived on pitching to that type of arrogance.This government has taken on more than just a yeomans task in ferrying people to the surface of Mars.Other countries have benefited from their offer by using those rockets as a taxi.For all of their nobility, this government has become overwhelmed by the services demanded from it and backlogged by those untimely launches.Their dream of uniting all of these countries under one banner is beginning to crack under this tremendous strain.Its putting the Alliance they have formed on fiscal hard times.There have been rumors of this throughout the financial community, Im sure some of you are well aware of the reports.The sovereignty for the Alliance of the Americas is on the line.They just havent made those facts public as of yet.Only the Singo Chinese can rival what this Alliance has done with their fleet of rockets.If this Alliance were allowed to concentrate on its own interests, like their Singo Chinese counterparts, and leave the rest of the international community behindWell lets just say there are a lot of forward thinkers who feel they could more than hold their own.Theodore Hadley had come from a long line of inheritance, the money his family had was believed to be birthed from the first transcontinental railroad.Those heirs had reinvested it wisely, passing it on from generation to generation.One rule of thumb it seemed the Hadleys had when conducting themselves in business was they never spoke up during the pitch session.They allowed the completion of the process to happen before they formulated their questions.So when Hadley decided to speak now, in front of the others, it more than caught this group off guard.His voice was well mannered, stern, and to the point.From what we currently see in the news, the Singo Chinese arent exactly lighting it up on the colonization front either.They have had their mistakes on Earth and on Mars.Their strategy for conquering the Red Planet seems to be based on exactly what has worked for them in the past, that is to say they simply over run such a desired enclave with sheer numbers.Its hard to deny that someone owns something if they are squatting on it.The only thing keeping them in check to this point is the problem they are having getting those numbers up there.Still, sometimes old strategies are the best strategies.They will win out if no one else goes up there to challenge them on this front.This retort was the reason Xavier had put a panel together.Besides helping him with insight, or having their names added to give credence to his proposal, they could participate in answering questions pertaining to their field.He had Engineers, Astronauts, Politicians, a Theologian, and he had Dr.M.  Book.If the colonization effort had a face it was that of Dr.M.  Book.He was an engineer with an extensive background in aerospace, who left his field to become an activist for the colonization of Mars.He could win the hearts and minds of anyone seeing even the slightest significance for going to the Red Planet.There were plenty of souls wanting to see the colonization effort succeed.It was never a question of gaining support for this vision, legitimate causes seemed to crop up everywhere.Some hoped Mars would be the scientific vindication they needed for a universe teeming with life.If they could somehow show this barren world had once contained even the simplest of microbes in its warm past, or housed them even now, then their arguments for life being robust and plentiful throughout the universe would be validated.This discovery would also help knock down a certain belief system some had for putting the Earth at the center of all creation.There were other groups who saw Mars as their pathway toward expansion.It would give them a fresh start, and put them on a technological plain with every other spacefaring civilization.The warning shots spurring them on came straight out of the Cretaceous period.The extinction level event that happened in the Yucatan Peninsula smacked down the dinosaurs and awoke humanity to the ultimate disaster of leaving all their eggs in just one basket.There was no better way to get around this then to ante up on the cosmic craps table with an additional line of planetary credit.Mars could also be seen as the new hope, but not because they thought the Red Planet was a better place to live as much as they had given up on trying to save their own world, Earth.They didnt have the confidence for a foreseeable future on the blue peril.There were too many pending catastrophes happening all at once, global warming, pollution, the melting of the polar ice cap, undersea methane release, a population problem, an over consumption of resources, rampant disease, and war.It was easier to sell a person on starting anew someplace else rather than have them stay and solve each of those dilemmas.Xavier Pentagrass could work with all those reasons for coming here but knew better than to hold onto any single one too tight.By embracing them all he found a way to sell the Red Planet as a profit point.This left him options to use every angle ever published or spoken by experts in the field.The smart money always followed a well laid plan and this venture was no different, pointing them to a bedrock of dividends, he just had to allow this plan to naturally unfold.Having Dr.M.  Books name attached to this consortium was like getting a blessing from the Pope.As much as he would have liked Dr.Book to continue, it was more important for Xavier to quell the people in that room and appear somewhat diplomatic.Its true, the Singo Chinese havent had the best of successes in recent memory.Yet they are showing the one quality most important in this venture, resiliency.They have a plan and they keep pushing forward with it.They are slowly chipping away at the difficulties that are holding them back.One can point to their misfortunes, snicker at their failed attempts, but at the current projected rate, if the Alliance doesnt start to try and match their efforts, a Red Mars may, in the end, be a Singo Chinese Mars.Dont stand there and try to repatriate us.This administration has taken their chances and walked down a path of their own choosing.Wentworth had raised his hand, shaking a finger at Xavier, looking more like an aging baseball manager arguing a bad call.Xavier had no choice but to react to this affront like an umpire brushing him off as he continued to officiate the game.I have personally had conversations with these politicians, and they acknowledged having been put on the spot.Their good intentions have been lost in the scathing reviews of recent press clippings.People refuse to remember the steps this country had to take in being represented on that red rock.The public has a very short term memory when it comes to good deeds done, and the news outlets dont help, beating more to the tune of what have you done for me lately.Under those circumstances the politicians have been pushed beyond their comfort zones and fear the guillotine will drop on their political careers come next election.Their Mars is for everyone approach, however gracious has left them holding the bag.Its only a matter of time before their decapitated carcasses hang limply out in the political breeze.They are desperate to make something happen before the next election, so this administration is prepared to open a door rarely made available to the general public.Jarvis Kendle, an aging oil tycoon and a financial maverick in his own right, chimed in rather abruptly.I dont want to sound too cynical, but what exactly are you asking us to do?Sponsor an astronaut?Fund the building of one of their Ares Rockets?Jarviss sarcasm smacked with his impatience to this process.The old blood was up in the room.Perhaps they were afraid of letting go of their money, or of the unknown this situation offered.Whatever it was, their mood was changing.Just as any good predator can sense the fear radiating from its prey, Xavier wanted to close in for the kill, however he could not let the excitement he had for this situation show.He needed to display a patience in letting them come to him.Closing his eyes he drifted back to the calming picture of the water droplet.The clear bead hung high above the lush rainforest as it blanketed this expanding gorge.The foliage had taken on the characteristics of a gigantic undulating sea of green, and from beneath it the occasional point from an ancient temple would poke through, looking more like a tombstone meant to mark the death of civilized thought than anything engineered by a people wanting to conquer their world.The jungle was primitive, remote, and overtly savage in its tropical growth.Perhaps this was why the jungle existed in his vision, because he knew deep in his heart, given enough time, the jungle would take back everything.The sphere of liquid reflected so much of this untamed world, yet it more than demanded he remain calm in the face of it.This whole process has been a very tenuous one to say the least.I acknowledge that.There is a thoroughness we need to adhere too when undertaking any financial venture bound for Mars.Look at what the Alliance of the Americas is having to endure, those planners were relying heavily on completed facilities.Those delays have cost them from using them as jumping off points to get their own biospheres started.I am sure their feelings are compounded by the fact that even when these facilities are completed, they will be tied to a nationalism that wont be completely sovereign to theirs.These shared facilities are equaled to shared problems.Every repair they have to tackle up there pulls from the budgets and diplomatic energies of this administration.Xavier paused just long enough to allow his next line of thought to really sink in.There is another concern the administration has, any type of proprietary research and development they wish to pursue cannot be done under these circumstances.Mr.Pentagrass, anytime I start to hear that type of talk, I cannot help but feel the paramilitary side of things beginning to creep into this process.Hadley had taken on the look of a father who had just caught his kids trying to pull a fast one on him.Clearly I cannot speak for the administration and its policies.I will try and stick to my field of expertise and solicit this one thought; a corporation must have the ability to develop proprietary technologies if it is to thrive in an open market.This concept is a very important component to the survival of a company.If invention and discovery are to be given away, than it is in direct conflict with a market driven by capitalism.Hadley wasnt biting on it.He had become adamant about the point he was trying to make, much like a dog that growled when someone reached for his bone.I just want to emphasize, in the same vein, Mars is to remain a free market, it is also to remain a military free environment.That is an ideal, and ideals are never based in reality.Jeb Wentworth spoke as if he were a pin set out to pop a balloon.That point can be argued, there are times as you well know, investment not only influences policy, it eventually becomes policy.This retort was punctuated by the pounding of a fist on the table.Dr.M.  Book surprised everyone again with his outburst.His scientific airs were fluttering about him as he passionately drove his point home, and these airs were helping Xavier haggle for their funding.It was brilliant and Xavier loved it, but he was also becoming keenly aware that the meeting was beginning to go in a different direction.They possessed a collective thought that had all the maneuverability of a large ship moving through an ocean.He needed them to stay the course or it would take Xavier a very long time to turn them around.These points are well taken.I want to make it perfectly clear though, that none of these ideas or concepts are being dismissed by this group.There are obviously a lot of things we as an investment group could talk about, and as we progress in this venture, we can schedule talks on any one of these subjects germane to this investment.I will stress though that, at least for today, we try and stay on the topic of why we are all here, and that is the opportunity this administration is presenting to us as investors.I wonder, are there minutes being taken at this meeting?Jeb Wentworth said it as if he were mulling over his thoughts on this subject out loud.In a way he was putting the firm on notice and making sure everything was on the record right from the start.Xavier had to make sure his response was delivered in the most comforting of tones, he wanted to put to rest any doubt that was forming.Of course.And the transcripts, will they be made available to all the investors who decide to remain with this group?Jeb wasnt going to let go of the issue so easily.He was calling Xavier to the carpet in the same way a politician is challenged with having to make a campaign promise in front of his constituents.Jeb was holding him accountable for everything he was saying and making sure it was on the record.Yes, the minutes will be made available to all those members vested in this group.Xavier paused just long enough for anyone else in the room who might have had a question, and when none was forthcoming, he knew these proceedings could continue.With that being said, are there any other objections?You have our ear Mr.Pentagrass.It can be a tough concept to master at times, during the process of a pitch, to know when one has reached the make or break point.Xavier likened it to a horse trotting around an equestrian course, the positive results are known only after the horse has cleared all the hurdles with its rider still intact.He glanced down at his notes.He felt as if he were still trotting along, moving forward, fixed atop of his horse.He closed his eyes for a moment and went back to his grounding vision of the water droplet, and found it right where he left it, hanging there in an almost perfect tear shape form.The droplet reflected the world around it, the images contained within were upside down and distorted.As he looked closer he could see a slight imperfection within the sphere, a little black speck in the middle of its globule.To him it looked to be the same type of black freckle found within the iris of an eye.Instead of revealing what this imperfection was, the droplet slowly made its way out along the underside of the ledge, moving away from him and further out into the world of chance.Xavier felt himself glide in that direction as well.We are here to talk about the prize that is Mars.The process of getting a foothold there can be broken down into two distinct categories, rocketry and colonization.The fiscal gap developing between these two categories has turned into an abyss for this administration, and they wish to bridge these two components making them whole in supporting each other once again.This will become a highly vested procedure, with the bulk of the process happening outside the realm of public scrutiny.The only clue anyone will ever have about this entire transaction is this firm will have purchased a very large government bond.The bond has been outlined in the materials we have provided for you here today.The amount of money the government is looking for is so large I doubt any one person could solely burden themselves with its balance.By pooling our resources together we can loan the government the money they need without the passage of a bill.This will ensure Mars will be colonized, and in return we will get a guarantee from the government that your money comes back to you at a moderate rate of interest.The look Mr.Wentworth gave Xavier was one a loan shark may give after his patsy has asked to borrow more money on top of what he already owes.However appealing this governments guarantee may sound to you Mr.Pentagrass, I dont need a consortium to invest in the financial bonds of this government.I can do that on my own, thank you very much.Is this why you have gathered us here?Please tell me there is something more than just a bond for us to invest in.No, Mr.Wentworth, by itself the offer is not very appealing.However this bond has another tier to it.This consortium would also share in the profits of whatever technologies are completely developed during the time of this firm holding the bond.Until we cash the bond out, the consortium would own shares in government funded projects.Anything and everything they would do within that time frame, we would own a share of.I am always very skeptical of investments trying to guarantee money back to the investor Mr.Pentagrass.Why all the guarantees?From my understanding in meeting with government officials, and looking at the materials made available to me, this administration needs the money right now.It cant afford to wait and hope these efforts straighten themselves out under the wisdom of congress.Nor do they want to air their dirty laundry of financial hardships to the press.Appearing stable and financially committed to the colonization effort is very important to the public persona of these officials.Whats the catch then?There is always a catch.The catch is the government is looking for a very large sum of money.The sum of money can only come from one investment group.More importantly, no matter what our money buys, no matter what is built on Mars within the time of our holding of the bond, the government owns all of it in the end, from the structures right down to the soil.There are no buy outs by this consortium.On paper it all seems pretty cut and dry, but please remember for this administration it is all very cut and dry as well.It has to be.They are feeling the squeeze of launching the international community to Mars.They are extremely frustrated with having to sit back and watch these countries struggle to put together the habitable facilities needed to stay there.The government is very anxious to get a handle on the business of colonization.We are in a unique position to facilitate that process.We have an opportunity to cash in on some pretty unique benefits as long as we are committed to being in it for the long haul, which means we need to show them we are resilient.His response was met with silence.If he had ventured out to the droplet of his vision, it would have quivered slightly as it began to take on more water.If we can achieve the target number, we will effectively lock out any and all competition.I cannot stress that enough, we just need to be the first.This group would cash in on all technologies developed under the umbrella of this Alliance.We would share in every widget, gadget, and hornswivle invented there.In addition the government would give this group tax breaks that arent available to the general public.This is as close to being tax free as you will ever get living in this country.All this consortium needs to do is achieve the dollar amount this administration is looking for.On paper Im sure this all looks good, but this optimistic approach isnt always the most healthy of approaches when it comes to investing money, there are going to be setbacks.No one is denying that there will be Mr.Hadley.This investment group has to expect failures; we see them all the time on Mars.In the long run it can only strengthen the resolve for our success.Look at how the mining of Deuterium has turned out for those investors who have waited.This administration is looking for a bailout.This consortium could do that for them, and have the ability to hide behind this firm while reaping the rewards.The people in this room would be spared any public scrutiny...Jeb interrupted him before he could finish his sentence.His face had taken on a rather flush color; his southern drawl became even more accentuated with his frustration.This may sound old fashion, but I believe in one thing, and that is the concept and process of actually investing in a company.It forces you to have an operating agreement and board meetings.There is a comfort in going to sleep at night knowing youre a shareholder.This gives an investor a feeling he has a say in what is happening with his money.If there is any hesitation with this group, it may be because as an investor we are looking for that kind of piece of mind.If things arent going our way up there, if failures begin to run rampant, and if this administration decides to fold up shop and walk away from Mars, what then?How do we get our money back?Where is our peace of mind then Mr.Pentagrass?Well as I said the bond...Its not outside the realm of possibilities this government renege on the bond.Jebs look to Xavier was stern, as if he were schooling him now.It would be easier for them to throw their hands up into the air as if they had never heard of us, or even better, for them to change the rules to fit their dire financial situation, just as they are doing right now mind you!It is not above this government to do that.Administrations have shown the propensity for it in the past.Once you open the door to that Pandoras box, well all I can say is that its an endless stream of bullshit.Jeb Wentworth shook his head.Its a matter of investor confidence, being public with the company allows for scrutiny, and in this case that would actually be a good thing.You see, it can work both ways Mr.Pentagrass.Xavier spoke carefully.As an investor, its nice to have options when making money.The way it stands now, it looks as if the government has a lock on every asset it will ever have on Mars.It is the same type of lock you have looked for when you have invested your money in the past.That being said, I have read the proposal several times over now, and I believe I have found a way to get peace of mind out of this situation, one that will satisfy the needs of everyone.The area containing our loophole would be the infrastructure they will be using to run the colonization effort.I am talking about the actual manpower the government will place on Mars.We should specifically be targeting the management positions within their corporation.I have checked with some government sources, and they tell me if we take the steps to make this funding available, we can appoint people in the top management positions to oversee everything happening up there.I believe that gives this consortium tight control on how the money would be spent.We would have the ultimate insiders point of view on the actual operation of the facility, and of course, in the end, we would have a hand on the pulse that is the business of Mars.Jeb was the first one to connect all the dots.When he spoke his voice had all the nuances of a prideful person completing a difficult puzzle before anyone else.Then all we need to do is find a candidate who is familiar with this group, someone we all trust.Someone who is not afraid to roll up their sleeves and dig deeper to get the information we need to run this company in the plus.Someone who has done their homework in garnering support from outside vendors and resources favorable to seeing this effort succeed.Someone who is familiar with the risk we have all taken to get here, and has a personal stake in overseeing the complete maturation of our investment.Very interesting Xavier.Very interesting indeed.The smile Jeb Wentworth had on his face would be something Xavier would not soon forget.Xavier stood there in front of the group with his eyes wide open, staring out into the stuffy conference room filled with those grubby old men.If they only knew at that moment he was blind to the world around him.His calming vision of the water droplet hanging out under the ledge came back into view.He watched as it slowly filled itself, trying to form into a perfect sphere.It hung there defying the gravity for this situation and almost attained its goal of maintaining minimal contact with the ledge.It was so close to perfection, except for the small black speck he saw inside of the droplet.He drew closer to have a better look, but suddenly and without warning the droplet released from the surface.It plummeted with all the weight of a ball bearing, and yet knowingly fell with all the wisdom of ripened fruit to the lush green jungle below.Xavier stayed with the droplet for as long as he could, but his calming vision was shrinking with the distance.There in the deepest part of his mind, it dissipated completely and forever under the foliage of the jungle.From under those giant leaves he thought he heard the faint rustling of whispers from the old men in that room murmuring their endorsement of him.02 Strike Dextoids Within the tattered tartan of American history, long ago during its second occupation of Iraq, where the tinsel strength from the threads of western civilization frayed under the efforts to oust the insurgency, Marines were asked to perform a procedure known as breeching.They would place charges on the door of a building and had a soldier stand a few feet away armed only with a shield to defend himself against the blast.The tactic allowed Marines to quickly enter a structure once those charges blew.After the explosion had gone off, and during the pandemonium that followed, the soldiers would forcefully make their way into the site with guns raised, shouting out commands in the native tongue of the people they were invading, and doing their best to regain control of the situation.This tactic was dangerous on multiple levels, there were the shards of shrapnel shot into the air, an unknown enemy strength laying beyond the initial blast, and the single Marine himself, bracing against the laws of physics with a temerarious sense of esprit de corps, having to find cover behind his shield.The energy from such a concentrated explosion has no way of dissipating over such a short range, nor can it be deflected as thought behind the ruggedness of the composite shield.In reality the energy of the blast would rap around the shield and hit the Marine.This energy would transcend into the body and actually ripple the tissue and organs of that person, making their internal structure look more like a very large flag caught in a breeze.The more sobering results took place on the brain, with enough applied force it actually moved within the skull and made contact against one of its walls.This quick and sudden external pressure on the brain translated into a moderate concussion.The concussions to these Marines, whether acknowledged or not by their superiors, were a daily part of their lives and they werent being treated for them.Years later the same traumatic after effects professional football players suffered from receiving repeated concussions in games, would also begin to show up in these soldiers.Those veterans lived in darkened rooms, found themselves fighting long bouts of depression, and had a deep rooted desire to be left alone.It was in effect, the same type of loneliness those soldiers felt all those years ago, having to hold their shield in front of a door lined with explosives.Robots seemed to be the natural substitution for what those soldiers were trying to achieve.However the technology wasnt sturdy enough to be deployed into a theater of conflict.The military had prototypes demonstrating great potential, but nothing ever met their stout line of specifications.Those robots operated on tank treads and were tethered to their command center by a very long cable keeping their remote status as long as their leash would allow them to travel.At their best they were there to sniff the situation out.Anything a robot could do, an autonomous vehicle can do better.It was the logical progression of things.The next rung on this evolutionary ladder for mechanized beings belonged to that of the Dextoids.Dextoids were the answer to what the military needed to breech a tough situation.This kind of autonomy gave Strike Dextoids an elite status within the fighting forces they had been assigned too.More importantly they struck fear into anyone unfortunate enough to encounter them.The first of these models were leviathans sticking out in a theater of conflict like a tank within a small battalion of troops.One would never mistaken a Strike Dextoid for anything benign found within the line of General Dextoid production, things like painters, delivery personnel, or a butler were much more subdued in their look and demeanor.Those Dextoid models were created solely for the purposes of serving humankind.Even the most harden structures on Earth were no match for a Strike Dextoid.These entities literally could run through walls in order to complete their mission.Even experienced soldiers out in the field wearing their modified exoskeleton suits, used all their new found capabilities for jumping and running to retreat from an area containing these relentless killing machines.It was believed all this newfound power would have commanders acting with impunity, that this power would corrupt and breakdown the moral fiber of the country producing them.The reality for their situation was anything but, those mechanized marauders held their commanders at bay.They had too much to lose if they let that type of technology fall into enemy hands.Much like a Stealth Fighter, Strike Dextoids were only sent out on well planned missions, given their targets of opportunity, and upon completion of their tasks were ordered always to return to base.There was an attitude permeating the air on every one of these missions for never wanting to leave a Strike Dextoid behind.Regardless of those constraints, watching a Strike Dextoid in action shook people to their conscious core.These machines were viewed as premeditated killers, acting only on the wishes of those who programmed them, and enforcing the ideology of a country.Globally people began to make a stand, asking what was their morally as a species.It was argued by many of those protesting that Strike Dextoids didnt have an appreciation for life, they lacked even the most basic of moral sensibilities.Their drives to achieve their targeted goals were pure and void of any human quality resembling that of compassion.Mercy was a quality not found in any part of their mission bible.Even if a person destroyed a Strike Dextoid they couldnt say they had actually killed it.This was a distorted form of human gratification those victors were willing to hang on a piece of broken metal.A person couldnt go out and kill a bulldozer.One has to live before they can die.As time passed these machines became more compact and mobile, running in tightly orchestrated divisions, and occupying areas with all the unwanted characteristics of an infestation.Anyone surviving this experience, walked away feeling as if they were up against a never ending swarm.The images for these Strike Dextoids joined the pandemic symbols within the human subconscious.Once people saw the true nature of their battle against these machines, they protested in large numbers demanding compassion be shown by the countries controlling these deadly devices.The overwhelming message for peace forced a dialog between the nations.Accords followed and became commonplace events.Within this framework diplomats were always seeking a limit to the number of Strike Dextoids any country could produce, much in the same way countries back in the day bickered over the number of nuclear weapons they were allowed to house in the dark confines of their silos.As the representatives from countries wandered down the long halls of those pacts, they steadily followed the rules of etiquette and proper procedures handed down to them from an era when men fought over lines of demarcation audaciously crisscrossing their globe.They debated and lectured, became theatrical filibusters, and rose to these challenges to become the rapporteurs of their day.They set policy and found common ground in a world gone mad under the threat of this lethal technology.Those diplomats extended their olive branches, and followed through with those processes of peace because deep down inside, they harbored a fear one day a rogue battalion of Strike Dextoids would go out on a mission and refuse to return.On that day humanity would feel the cold chill given off by a technology hell bent on ending their existence.As bizarre as this sounded at least the destruction was happening on Earth.If a structure were damaged to the point of having to be evacuated, people could feel safe running under the Capri blanket of their oxygen filled world.A similar disaster on Mars was an untenable nightmare, structures were the very worlds in which people lived.No one person was wandering the Martian surface without the use of some type of artificial environment.Failure to a biosphere didnt have people running out into that caramelized sky.It was a fragile membrane separating human beings from the harsh conditions of Mars.This same membrane existed on Earth between humanity and every creature that came into contact with the brutal machinery of mankind.Those creatures, like the humans on Mars, had nowhere to go if things became untenable.As the pendulum swung somewhere between drastic and chance, between finding a peace or trying to carve out a niche on another world, governments were beginning to ask their citizens to align themselves with their ideology.Scientists knew better then to do anything more then dabble in those geo political frays, but the governments they worked for were not so understanding.When confronted with the question at all those accords, there wasnt a diplomat who ever saw Mars as being anything but a weapons free world.Some of those governments pressed their people to bend the rules just a little bit when up there.It was a fact that certain personnel did feel better if they were able to hold onto a metal pipe, a slingshot, or conceal a taser on their person.Some colonists may have leaned toward having a weapon on their person, but only because they feared the day that out of a receding wave of ideology, a Strike Dextoid would appear alone out on their horizon.PORAGE OF SUSPICION Alec ran across the desert like a surge of electricity looking for ground.He had been pushing himself non stop for more than two weeks, and he was tired only in the way Dextoids who have pushed themselves beyond their limits can get tired.It was tedium to always be on at full capacity, tedium to be on guard at all times, but this was where Alec found himself.Tedium had latched onto his person and was leaching away at his energy levels, slowly replacing them with small palatable portions of paranoia.Those morsels when seen by themselves were like individual pieces of kibble, and when digested could hardly have an impact on his being, but over time as he began to acclimate his system to being fed in this way, it became the provender for all his fears.When those types of feelings crept into his being, he would mentally fast just to get to a leaner mode of thinking, which allowed him to grit portions of his life out.For him this all had become an unexpected marathon, a mad dash from everyone around him.The stakes were all too high, and because of this he knew in the end no one could be trusted.Those feelings were part of his paranoia of course, but he also knew those feelings were unavoidable.It was as unavoidable as the questions people had for Dextoids on the topic of paranoia.Human beings had a curious propensity for the subject, it was as if they could sense the uneasiness within their creations, much like catching the scent of cheap cologne, they just couldnt put their finger on exactly where the tawdry smell was coming from.He looked up into the sky to see the sun beginning to make its descent.There was still enough daylight to get to the next mesa, and from there he would analyze his final moves before nightfall.Being atop that rise would also allow him to confirm the cylinder like objects he thought he saw from the last ridge.Mars was littered with abandoned spacecraft, or worse yet vehicles that crashed as they tried to land here.Each success was a testament to the cunning desperation mankind had in trying to make it here.It was like watching a person throw darts at a board, constantly going for the bulls eye.Un manned rockets also rained down like that out of the sky in a torrid storm of redundancy.It was a clear sign of how uneasy these colonists felt about their situation; they had to have a backup plan to their backup plans.The pockmarks littering the surface of Mars were a reminder that accidents happened everywhere people went, and because of that the scars to the psyche of those inhabitants werent so easily healed.That was probably because they knew out in the deep vacuum of space, capsules traveling toward the Red Planet were so great in number they looked to be paving some sort of super cosmic highway, and there were always more capsules heading toward Mars than away from it.These thoughts swirled in his head as he found himself steadily making his way up the ridge.It was difficult for him to say where all his thoughts were coming from, or how they came to be, but they were there nonetheless, a paradox to the control he thought he possessed.From atop the mesa he looked down into the basin and confirmed the cylinders as being those of rockets.The vehicles stoically stood there, dotting the landscape all the way out to the horizon.An eerie feeling began to take hold of him the longer he stared, the more those rockets looked like tombstones, grave markers to a lost civilization.It wasn't about the promise of life but the fact this effort represented a death.Looking out across that rocket garden he didnt care where he went in this world, as long as he stayed clear of the people he knew were out there after him.He glanced down to the bottom of the long running grade and noticed a spacecraft lying on its side.The markings on it were barely legible, but still clear enough to indicate it was of Singo Chinese origin.Anyone looking at this rocket could tell it went more then just a little off course in its final descent.If by chance the capsule had contained human occupants, then those people must have experienced a wild swing of emotions, going from the highest of highs, to the sudden realization their dreams were ending before they could safely reach the Martian surface.Even from where he stood now, he knew it had to have been absolute bedlam inside that capsule.Alec shuttered at the thought of being confined in one of those tin cans.He had an even harder time imagining what it would be like during a malfunction.The disdain he had for this technology conjured up feelings of wildly implausible anachronisms.Did human beings co exist with dinosaurs?No, of course not!How was it a thing like a rocket could still be around to carry a Dextoid?Were they still manufacturing chariots to carry men?Dextoids and rockets should have never had the possibility of being linked together in the same sentence.This though, wasnt so much his problem as humanities technological harbinger to bear.Alec found himself making his way down the backside of the mesa, his thoughts trailing behind creating a mental wake.The damaged rocket lay below him, partially crumpled where it had finally fallen.It looked like some weakened pillar from the Parthenon lying on its side.Looking at the wreckage he couldnt help the urges he had for reversing the fall and deducing the cause of the malfunction.As he approached this wreck he felt himself an investigator sent here by the respective Space Agency to solve this particular case.The entire craft looked as if it suffered from some type of charring pox.The skin on the cylinder was fretted, eaten away with deep pits and blistering scabs.Compartment doors swung freely in the breeze, revealing the lifelines of cables and connectors tethering this vehicle together.Alec found a beauty in this type of fallen technology, much like the person of Earth who found an abandoned gas station in the middle of the desert a scenic work of art.The weather had taken its toll on the skin of this craft, wearing the protective coating down to its core, giving it a unique textured appearance.The surface was cracked and chipped, having been bleached under the sun.Those subtle little nuances painted themselves into his being, speaking of the passage of time, and the proof of a different type of resiliency.He scanned the craft in this way until he visually came to rest on a pole propping up the main door of the capsule.It had been done in purposeful fashion, turning the hatchway door into an awning.That pole became a spurtle, snapping him back to reality and stirring the porridge of his suspicions.His back immediately tingled with tiny burning pinpricks as if it were the jolting alarm to what the propping of this hatchway meant.He crouched down next to an out cropping, jutting from the side of the slope.These types of features began to appear across the Martian landscape as the planet was reawakening to the tremors of rolling crust and smoldering signs of volcanism.There was no doubt the planet was coming back to life under the tidal forces of gravity, and the stick they chose to stir this geological process both terrified and excited the colonists.Their unique approach caused people to scan the heavens for the detection of extraterrestrial life in a whole new light.As Alec crouched down next to this protruding stratum, he scanned the ground around the fallen hulk.There were a number of footprints working there way too and from the make shift awning.Those footprints followed a distinct path forming a set of trails.They lead themselves into the rocket garden as well as worked their way along the sides of the basin.As he looked at those footprints, he became aware they were of all the same size.It was a smaller print than he himself would have left, so he deduced the size of the person or Dextoid leaving them couldnt be any larger then he was.As he was figuring this out, he became aware of the subtle sounds of someone approaching from behind.The intonation of those footsteps were gaining speed, closing in on him.Remaining calm, he chose not react to this interloper.He continued to play it as if he were lost in his thoughts about the downed capsule and the spidering trails of exploration that radiating away from the propped up door.The person was almost at a full run now, but Alec continued to play it cool.He waited until they were almost on top of him.He knew this was happening because a few pebbles of shale flew past his feet, complimented by the billowing clouds of dust.He quickly reacted, spinning around to see a woman attempting to strike him with a metal pipe.It seemed for Alec there were frozen moments of time unfolding frame by frame with their milliseconds of pistic imagery.His sight was keen, transcending any kind of consternation.To shatter a windowpane would have him seeing every single shard of glass.Those moments passed so slowly they knew no sound.No one needed amplification while being consumed by a sea of diamonds.The picture he was now witnessing had her spraying the air with beads of sweat.As she became fully elongated holding a pipe high over her head, this glistening nuance ejected itself from her body.She looked to be in the act of trying to chop a block of wood with just one swing.As she began to drop it downward, the physical effort caused her long hair to radiate upward and outward.Her intense gaze was fully focused on her task at hand.She hadnt even come close to touching him, yet somehow he found himself struck by the raw form of her beauty.As she tried to bring the pipe down onto his head, he rolled out of the way, and then turned back toward her so he could kick out one of her legs from underneath her.She fell to the ground awkwardly, passing him by as she rolled down to the bottom of the ridge.Through it all she managed to hold onto the pipe, clutching it tightly, which surprised even him.She snapped a look over her shoulder and scrambled to the side of a large rock at the base of the ridge.She lifted the pipe, pointing it at him, it looked to be more in an effort to maintain the space between them.Have you come to kill me?To hear the frantic desperation in her voice was unsettling even for him.He had no doubt she was terrified.If she had said anything else to him in any other way, he would have been ready for it, but the tone in this one quip caught Alec completely off guard.His paranoia paled to what he was witnessing in her.He shook his head slowly, almost in disbelief of her even having asked the question.No.It was obvious this simple response wasnt going to be good enough.She cultivated a look and sound of someone suffering from a frazzled annoyance.Then you are here to take me back.No.Her agitation was building with each of his denials.You lie.He knew he needed to comfort her but it wasnt going to be easy.He had an urge to try and calm her down by touching her, it seemed like the right thing to do, but that wasn't going to happen as long as the pipe she held was extended in his direction.He had no choice but to stand his ground and responded.No.There would be no reason for me to lie.I thought this capsule abandoned and only sought refuge here.There was no reason for her to trust him, and her next sentence was filled with hyperventilating uneasiness.No one sent you?No one sent me.Alec tried to relax his posture and give her a calming smile, but he could tell by her facial response she wasnt buying into it.Frustration began to wash over him as he tried his best to convey he wasnt a threat.It made him think of all the people he had ever encountered to this point in his life.Most would have said they felt threatened and that made him laugh a little.Suddenly he realized his odds of easing her feelings werent that good.The only way he knew of defusing this situation was to shoot straight.I am on the run just like you.The doubt resonating within her must have been a byproduct of her having been isolated for so long all the way out here.When he processed this revelation, there really wasnt any one good reason for her to try and see his side of things.Her retort confirmed this.Oh really?And why are you on the run?There were those moments for a Dextoid when denial became the focus of their existence.Their personal experiences became the baggage they would rather hide than rummage through.Their mental areas would partition out, taking on the most convoluted forms of storage, areas similar to a basement or an attic, perhaps a cave or an endless fall of water.At no time did a Dextoid feel the need to ever go back and organize that data.They closed those places off, allowing them to become the forbidden zones within their beings.They existed only as points of reference in a life made to be lived in the ordinary.It seemed to be in complete contrast to who they were, but if they could ignore the extraordinary things in their lives, they would function at a much more efficient level.This was the twisted world of compliance a Dextoid was forced to believe in if they were to operate freely within the social norms of a human civilization.In tests where they had strapped a Dextoid down into a chair and hard patched them into monitoring systems, it only took a few well placed questions to be asked before the information stored within those partitioned areas was released.The answers they looking for were grabbed, roughed up, and forced out into the light.Much like some innocent victim of a socialistic state who has been locked away for years than suddenly delivered into a specially designed town square to endure public ridicule and drubbing.Stirring somewhere deep inside Alec then, beyond the barrier of intransigent thought, was a building desire to blow off a little steam.To confide in someone the hows and whys, and the seemingly absolutes of his everything.She stood there panting like a wild creature, dire in waiting for what he might say or do next.Whatever he said would have to have her believing she could disavow all of her insecurities about the situation.What sentence could do that?He knew the answer to her question yet it was almost too unbelievable even for him to say, and he had been the one who had been living it.What would a long drawn out story about his being on the lamb accomplish?This moment garnered a simple summation of what he had been through, and it needed to be punctuated by an overt act of surrender.Whatever it was, he had to be surrendering to this particular moment.So he surrendered, feeling his full weight, and dropping down avoirdupois to one knee.He really wanted her to see the heavy suit of exhaustion that had been burdening him.He handled himself as if he were a battle hardened knight presenting himself to his queen after failing to complete a long and arduous quest.His knack for survival came blurting out in punctuated arrogate prose.Because I feel I have more to do with my life than to be a slave to those people.He pointed out into the desert as he spoke, to a place well beyond the horizon, to a place infested with the stench of humanity.As he did this he really wanted to emphasize the words, those people.His answer rekindled something inside her and she began to work her way up into a position of standing at ease again.Yes.She said excitedly.I felt the same way.I could no longer do the tasks they required from me.So this is it for you then, youll stay out here for as long as you have too?Yes, I am prepared to stay out here, by myself, for as long as I have too.Alec took a long look around at the inhospitable isolation she had submerged herself into.It seems like a waste in so many ways for you to be out here all by yourself.I would think you could find any number of things to do in the service industry that would limit your interactions with them.But at some point I would still have to interact with them, and they for lack of a better word, vex me.I just cant bring myself to be apart of that process anymore.Their influence has us suffering from some type of self induced agoraphobia.I dont think either of us enjoyed functioning under their rule.It should come as no surprise we find ourselves out here.She laughed out loud, it may have been closer to a chortle.Either way it sounded as if the emotional release had been a long time in coming.It must have been hard to find something to laugh about in this desolation.Her reaction triggered something inside his person and brought out laughter from him as well.For whatever the reason it actually felt good to have something to laugh about.There was a conscious effort on her part to suddenly be cordial, as if the thought had just crossed her mind.Alec wondered if in part her welcoming protocols hadnt just kicked in.My name is I Glo.I suppose just calling me Glo would suffice, but I havent found a comfort with it yet.I have always associated that type of abbreviation as rather immature or even childish.Its as if one were trying to vie for some additional attention in their life, which should be more than obvious from looking at my surroundings I am not.Alec walked over to her and slowly extended his hand.For some reason he was finding an importance in following through with the act of making contact with her.There was more to this gesture than trying to put her mind at ease and he wished he had more time to ponder these thoughts.Dextoids always seemed to have a little edge to them when they sequestered themselves like this out on their own.It was as if the sands of time were running through an hourglass counting out to the grain their very last moment of freedom.Fear would naturally manifest itself under this granular shower, so her worn out appearance should have come as no surprise.Yet with his approach, he could see she had embraced her beleaguerment, succumbed to being a citizen of her isolation, she was the beautiful burgess of the self exiled.As their hands touched, he felt a warmth that was completely unexpected, it was as if Dextoids were capable of generating some type of triboluminescence.The touch had him wondering immediately how old could she be?Where was she made?How did she escape?It was strange and implausible to want to know everything about another Dextoid after having just met them, yet there he was, wanting to know all the answers to every question he had.All of this internal pother inspired a desire from within to say her name.It seemed as simple as dropping a pebble in undisturbed water.The slow rolling ripples developing from this action were the repeating waves of desire lapping against the banks of his newfound craving.He needed to say her name, to hear the way it resonated within him, and do it without sounding the least bit trite.It was so simple and singular in purpose it was almost laughable, but it had all the possibilities of rhythmically playing out over and over again in his subconscious and echoing on into his forever.He inhaled deeply and took a chance on forever.How long have you been out here, I Glo?What does it matter?Alec looked past the make shift awning and to the entrance she called home.The spaceship had fallen hard, crumpling within its framework to openly express its long forgotten usefulness.Alec had a photograph stored within the remote confines of his memory.It was undated, but taken long before any of the ecological downturns had befallen Earth.It was the only photo of that region they had stored within his database, as if the image were placed there to represent an ideal.The picture was wider than it was tall, and showed a large rolling plain vanishing into a cloud filled mid summers day.The field was filled with long stocks of golden wheat, kissed by the pockets of stark afternoon light.The billowing purple and white clouds telegraphed a health still present in the air.They were spread out just far enough so each cloud cast their own blotting shadow across the ground and emphasizing the darkness soon to consume this obnubilate world.The wheat had big budding grains, and swayed under the swirling breeze of the day.Those stocks took on all the characteristics of a huge crowd of people happily supporting themselves against each other.Off in the distance of a gently rolling hill was an abandoned pickup truck.It showed all the signs of being completely rusted out, giving it a preparatory feel, one of a sinopia applied to a fresco.This portrait of wheat had to be located somewhere within the Midwest of North America.It was obviously taken to reflect the plentiful richness of a nation.Alec got that message, but it wasnt what struck him about the photograph.To him it was about the rusted out truck off in the distance lying dormant out there all alone.He found it rather odd people could walk away from the very tools that got them there.These worlds were littered with their conveyances.In some way this was the answer to her query.What does it matter?The question had merit, especially when he reflected against the boundaries of his strategic programming.Answering her question meant he was responding to all the scenarios playing out in his head, giving things value, putting them on black or white squares, and moving them about to gauge his best chances for survival.There were times he couldnt stop the gamesmanship even if it was for his own good, and this would have been one of those times.I was just thinking, if I were a part of a Singo Chinese consortium that set up a rocket garden in the middle of a basin type crater, I would be keeping track of all of my assets.Everything has a value up here, things cannot be abandoned like some truck in a wheat field.Even if you could perfectly time your movements with the passing of their spy satellites high overhead, keep to the trails, moving to and fro like you have been, I still think over time they would have a pretty good snapshot of things being moved about within this area.What if by chance, because of all that data, they have already figured out you are here?It would only be a matter of time before they came to get you.I Glo pulled her hand away from Alecs.I knew it!You are here for me!Alec looked a little shocked, he didnt think what he had just said had any aggression behind it at all, but it was obvious he had struck a nerve within her.He tried to pull himself back into good graces.I told you I wasnt here to do that.Think about it, if I really wanted you, I could have overpowered you by now.The response caused I Glo to puff herself up.Dont be too sure of yourself.Im not a push over, in fact I am quite sure I am more than you can handle.I Glo allowed the silence that followed to slowly play out until she gave him a smile.Alec noted the warmth it caused within him and if they chose to use it, could have melted away the polar icepacks.Besides its not for a lack of them trying.The Singo Chinese have sent three patrols through here since I began using this as a dwelling.I always know when they are approaching, and depart long before they arrive.Each of these rockets has a very sensitive proximity device.The astronauts must have used this technology during their descent phase.I have taken a few of them off those ships and set up a perimeter to help alert me if someone tries to approach.I Glo and Alec traded smiles.The last time they were here they actually left a note asking me to turn myself in.
