Henry and  Rory were just friends.That's all I  know. "Andrew was nearly certain she knew nothi ng, but he had one last gambit to play.And then perhaps he could trust her and use her to help him find the real killer."I have enough evidence to charge you with the murder of Henry Archer.You  had access and motive.You have the skills and the desire.Tell me what I want to know. ""Motive!What motive would I have to kill Henry Archer?""His reconciliation with Callie Archer.He was leaving you for his wife.You  couldn't stand the thought that he might dump you. ""Leave me for his wife?Absurd!""Then you'd be out in the cold.Would  your long legs and full body ever get you  another man as rich as Henry Archer?You couldn't afford to lose him.But Rory Edwards  is almost as rich.Did he put you up to this?""I don't know what you're talking about. "Andrew took Irene by the arm, squeezing her with a strong hand.Her knees  sagged as he shook her."I'm talking murder, Miss Stevens.Cold blooded murder, planned by his business  partner and executed by his jealous mistress. "Irene burst into tears, and she wailed, "I loved Henry!I loved him so much. "Andrew stepped back.Even while crying, Irene Stevens was a beautiful woman,  and, as all his honed instincts told him, innocent."I'm sorry for your loss, Miss Steven  s.  And I'm sorry for putting you through  that. "Irene Stevens turned away from him."Damn you," she hissed."Yes, damn me.I'll find my own way out. "The door slammed, echoing through the cavernous emptiness of the apartment.Irene wiped the tears from her eyes.They ha d served their purpose.Andrew Venice was  convinced she was innocent.And then there was that time they all we  nt to see the Atlanta Braves at Turner  Field.Irene Stevens couldn't have been mo  re excited.Their seats were great.Andrew  Venice had dugout tickets for the season, as he  always did, being so incredibly well set  up.Andrew called Irene and said he was taking Richard Issacs to the next game and  would she like to come too because they would love to have her along and she, of course  said, shrieked really, YES!YES, OF COURSE!Irene loved the energy and commotion of   the enormous crowd in the stadium.She loved their front row seats, right up next to the green railing where she was currently  draped over the bar watching the players or watching their cute butts avidly.Andrew was a marvelous guy.He really was.She was c onsidering coming onto him because he was  like 20 years younger than Henry, god rest his  soul.And he was nice looking to sort of  like George Clooney on a good day and a little like Rowan Atkinson on other days but  Rowan was in his own way a little hottie reall y.  After Henry any man would appear a bit  on the small side by comparison anyway.And not nearly, nearly as rich.Richard didn't have as sweet a persona lity as Andrew but then few men did but  he was very well built.He had the shoulders  of a water buffalo and the waist of a ferret.He was reddened by his many sporting activitie  s which he managed to keep up within  addition to his busy job as a stock broker, a nd that reminded Irene of safari hunters and  virile construction workers which contracted  quite sexily to his suit and tie demeanor.Irene was considering coming onto him but he  was older than Henry was when he died  even though he hadn't died of natural causes  but he was dead and  Richard would die too  someday.Both of the men couldn't have been nicer to Irene and she was literally basking in  their solicitors attentiveness.They nestle  d her cozily in between them and heaped  compliments upon compliments upon her.Then they started talking about the ballplayers  and discussing their merits which started to bore Irene a little, really, although she was  far too sweet a girl to ever let on.For a while she had amused herself with deciding  which of the players had the sexiest name    but finally she was stuck between Roman  Colon and Armando Almanza and evens that diversion got boring.So she leapt out of her seat and lean ed over the railing to watch the game more  closely and wish that baseball uniforms were n't so concealing of the many lovely male  bodies sweating in the heat of the sun bea  ting down on the picturesque turf spread out like a vast green carpet where someone ha     d vacuumed with mathematical precision  making these swish marks in the shag that    made neat patterns on the carpet that just  scream it's clean and recently vacuumed until someone walks around and then all you get  are just footprints everywhere and finally   the carpet just gets squished down and sick  looking.Irene still listened to the conversation   the men were having because she was a  good listener but it was like they were talking  in code and trying to figure out what they  were saying was beginning to bug her.She wa  s ultra aware that her very short shorts  were giving her a wedgie just short of b ecoming thongs only she didn't have a thong on  or anything else on but the shorts.Except her  tight T shirt, that is.She didn't mind that  Andrew and Venice were seeming to stare more  at her than the ballplayers because she  figured she was more interesting anyway.She tossed her long blonde hair back and  chewed her bottom lip wondering what Richar  d had meant when he said to Andrew,  "Hell, yes, I'll inform.I'm an informant.That's what I do, and I inform. "Andrew seemed to know instantly, though.He said back to Richard in a low  voice "I've been a police detective for a long time and I've got plenty of people reading  skills so I already knew this long before you told me. "They kept talking about that on a nd on and it was boring and bugging Irene who  was no fool for a young woman in her twenties, if  only just barely in her twenties at that,  and she had heard the rumors flying around   Atlanta but no one was going to pull the  grape vine over her eyes.Some people were   thinking there was something suspicious  about Henry's tragic car accident, god rest    his soul.And if there was something  suspicious about it then there was SO      MEONE suspicious behind the something suspicious.And that someone could only be     someone like her or Henry's wife, that  arrogant woman.It was hard not to miss Henry and how  well he made her feel about herself and  all.They had spent so many fun hours together at Henry's private gym where he showed  her his former bodybuilding techniques that  produced that massive pecs and washboard  abs and he loved to watch her on the treadm  ill.Business talk made her head hurt and  Henry despite being a millionaire industria  list never talked about business much.He  sometimes talked about his wife Callie and Irene didn't mind listening to him talk about  Callie because every other phrase practica  lly was "not like YOU, my sweet Georgia  moonpie" and she had to agree with him that Callie was pure unadulterated evil.And now she had to think about business  because she'd lost Henry and while her  apartment was paid up for the year she kne w Henry couldn't renew her lease and she'd  have to come up with a plan for her future.Sh e'd responded to an ad, well, a flyer, really,  that had been tucked under her windshield  wiper about a month ago although it was hard  to remember how long ago it had been afte r Henry had perished unexpectedly.But she  was clearly on her way to a fabulous career    because of that ad.It had sounded very  exciting  Educational Opportunity to Ente r the Glamorous World of Pampered Porn  Stars!The price was steep but Irene's bank   account had been left in a healthy state  because of Henry and her sometimes wished Henry was still as healthy too but his legacy  might provide her with a future after all.She'd called the number on the pastel pink  sheet that very evening and chatted to  Jack and Steve for hours about their course   which included the latest in analysis with  sophisticated computer software that monitored her daily progress in a scientific manner.She signed up and began her lessons right  away, which she found extremely enjoyable.Computers were everywhere and they had  all these cameras hooked up to the computers  to analyze her performances from every angl e to give her constant feedback about what  she could improve on during her next lesson.It was all very high tech and Irene was  impressed with the program Jack and St     eve had designed and the selflessness they  exhibited throwing themselves into her education as they tirelessly taught her just what it  takes to be a major adult motion picture star  even if they were Geeks who wore glasses  and white socks and watches with lots of buttons when they were having sex.They said one of her hottest natural   talents was the ability to make beautiful  stringers, which were x rated parlance for spit,  really.Jack said it was even more of an  asset in the business than her naturally  large bosoms and her preternaturally voluptuous  hips and buttocks.Steve said if they ever   ran out of lube on the set Irene would be  invaluable.Irene's lessons were taking up a lo t of her time and they were even tossing in  free hours of tuition anytime she came over to their place.They always sent her home  with lots of material to study, from pie charts showing exactly how much time she'd spent  doing DPs and reverse cowgirls and so onto DVDs  that she was to watch to gain insights  into how the actresses excelled at facials, which wasn't her forte so far, but apparently  grinning while getting hit in the eye was essential in the business and Irene couldn't stand  her eyelashes clumping together so she was still working hard on getting used to that.Andrew said in a growl voice, "We will   get to the bottom of this" and Richard  harrumphed in a good natured but skeptical  way.Irene suddenly felt famished and told  the two that she was going to go to a concession stand for a bite to eat and then she had to  practically beat them off with a stick if she'  d had a stick, that is, to get them to let her goes by herself which she really wanted to  do because she wasn't sure what she wanted  when she got there.The bustle and noise of the audience  made her feel like a stalking goddess who  prowled through a jungle of people, like a     beautiful unique bird of prey swooping  through the vast flocks of awed penguins,  secretly powerful and utterly desired by each  man that walked by her and she felt her vol uptuous chest swell with happiness at how it  felt to be in her soft peachy skin but fi  rm, too, like a fresh peach, not something over   ripened in a cut rate grocery store that's  been sitting out getting squeezed by pensioners  too many times before ending up being carel essly self bagged and dropped off a counter  in a rusted out double wide trailer in a run down trailer park.She was walking away from Frankly My   Dear with her footlong drenched in  mayo and mustard and ketchup and relish a     nd had just wrapped her warm pink lips  around the large hotdog when a young man had stared at her with a frozen expression as  he slowly reached up and removed his baseba ll cap and held it reverently over his heart."You you you," he stammered as she tried to sm ile sweetly and yet finish taking the bite  of her hotdog."You you you're ...  "he continued valiantly."You you're Voluptia!"Irene was slightly puzzled but quickly    concluded that he must have meant  "voluptuous" so she nodded and said thank you."I go there every day," he said and Ire   ne said "Where's that?"and he said  "Double u double u double u dot ex ex ex dot com" and Irene was totally baffled and told  him to have a really nice day after she swallowed.It was like the whole world spoke in c ode sometimes and Irene did not plan on  becoming a cryptographer because it gave her  a headache to worry herself over what the world went on and on about.But Irene's   dreams of being somebody someday were as  nourishing as a footlong on a bright sunny day  in a place full of screaming fans and the  smells of mens' colognes and spilled beer a nd admiring glances that followed her all the  way back to the dugout where Richard and   Andrew welcomed her returning presence  with open arms.They even agreed her hotdog,  what was left of it, looked delish and that  her condiments were creative.Irene beamed with love for the whole world and hummed  "Take me out of the ball game" beneath her  breath and generally relaxed in the sensual  warmth of the day with her head leaned   over on Andrew's hard chest and her toes in  Richard's lap getting rubbed while Andrew stroked her honey silken hair around her  apricot ears and lingered over her sun flushed cheeks with gently tantalizing fingers.So she dozed off for a while and      missed the Braves scoring the winning  touchdown but she awoke when the crowd  exploded with joy and hugged Richard and  Andrew in an outpouring of pure happiness, really, except for the bit about missing  Henry, god rest his soul, of course.Callie pulled up into the driveway and turned the key.She sat for a moment and  stared at the house.It was a crimson scarle t red color with a sharply slanted roof, which  was graced with a cacophony of Christmas lights  that twinkled and sparkled like colored  stars.It reminded her of her own house, w ith her own Christmas lights, and she smiled a  soft smile.She loved Christmas.It re  minded her of when her family would huddle  around the tree, singing songs and opening presents.For twenty years they had used the  same tree, a tall, broad pine that smelled fain tly of pine.She loved that tree, so much so  that she never took it down.For thirty years,  she kept the tree just as it was, awash with  lights and shiny balls.Henry thought her daft, and oft his accounting friends would come  over for Easter dinner and see the tree standing proud in the corner with its lights and balls and Henry would try to quickly shoo them to the dining room but they would have  none of that as theyd stand before the tree and rub their chins in thought and say in their  funny accents its over, you know but Callie w  ould just smile her soft smile as she  spooned out the mashed potatoes.Callie stepped out of the car and shook  the chill from her voluptuous bones.The  snow crackled beneath her feet as she made  her way along the driveway and up the icy  steps, taking each with care.It reminded her of the church and their icy steps, only much  more so.She knocked on the door, which     made a muffled hollow sound beneath her  knuckles, like the sound of an unripe cantaloupe.She was picky about her cantaloupes.The door opened and Callie was greeted  with her friend Yvonne.Callie smiled  and shifted voluptuously as she stared at he r friend.She reminded her of a volcano, her  molten red hair flowing moltenly down her back and over the sandy white beaches of her  shoulders, as hair is wont to do.Yvonne   smiled back, her lips glossed in a shade of  lipstick that reminded Callie of the house paint.Come in, Yvonne said, her scintillating green eyes dancing playfully in the  evening darkness.Callie closed the door behind her and to ssed her coat onto a nearby chair.She  took a seat on the couch and ran her fingers  along the coffee table, breathing deeply the  dark and heady aroma of furniture polish.Yvonne slinked towards the kitchen.Dinners almost ready.Make yourself at  home.Callie stood and straightened her cashmere dress and proceeded to a small bar on  the other side of the living room.The plus h carpeting squished between her toes and she smiled a soft smile.It reminded her of the  dreamy times she had spent with her beloved  Henry shopping for carpeting.Shed happily sk   ip between rolls of pastel blues and  ruddy browns and giggle as she rubbed her ch eek against their fuzziness.The salesmen  were always quick to help her, no doubt as    delighted with carpeting as she was, and  cheerfully waved goodbye when they left, a roll of bunny patterned carpet hoisted on one  of Henrys broad shoulders and Callie clinging lovingly to the other.Callie examined the bottles and swished the contents of a few.She tapped her  chin and foot as she pondered over her decision.Scotch?No.Vodka?No.Rum?No.Tequila?No.Gin?No.Re d Wine?No.White Wine?No.ros Wine?No.Sherry?No.Very Dry Sherry?No.Brandy?N     o.   Grand Marnier?No.Vermouth?No.Crme de Cacao?No.Crme de Menthe?No.Schnapps?No.Whiskey?No.Bourbon?No.Rye?No.Ick.Callie sashayed towards the bookshelf w  ith its myriad of books.She ran her  fingertips along the spines and was amazed      at the wide variety that Yvonne had  collected.Tall books, thin books, fat books , short books, books with brown covers,  books with white covers, books without cove rs, hard books, soft books, hard books that  felt like soft books, and everything in between.It reminded her of a library with lots of  books.Yvonne emerged from the kitchen bearing a large plate with a large ham on top  which had small cherries and small pieces     of pineapple stuck into it with wooden  toothpicks.The scent of ham and cherry  and pineapple wafted languidly towards Callie  and she breathed deeply of its heavenly scent.It smells heavenly, Callie noted, and Yvonne grinned impishly.Callie took a seat at the table and unfurled her napkin.She placed it on her lap as  she was always taught and arranged her silverwa re just so.She poured herself a glass of  milk from the fridge and began scooping out potatoes for the both of them.Yvonne poured herself a drink and melted  into the chair across from Callie.She  brushed a strand of moltenly hair from her ey es and proceeded to carve the ham.Callie  watched intently.Juice streamed from the  ham in rivulets like saliva drooling from the  fierce jaws of a wild dingo poised over the dead carcass of its prey in the dingo eat dingo  world.It smells heavenly, Callie said.Yvonne dropped a slab onto Callies eager ly awaiting plate and garnished it with  a cherry.Callie popped the cherry into her mouth and smiled a soft smile.Its sweetness  reminded her of sweet things and that made her smile.Yvonne dabbed at the corner of her m outh with a napkin and washed down the  ham with a chug of wine.I bought that lovely dress today, she chirped excitedly.Which one?Callie inquired.The lovely one, Yvonne explained.What does Roberto think of it?Callie queried.Yvonne giggled like a giggly girl.He th inks its lovely, she responded as she  shifted voluptuously in her seat.Youre a lucky woman, Callie commented, tossing her mane voluptuously.She sighed vehemently.I do so really very much miss Henry.At  least he  didnt  leave you broke, Y vonne grunted as she struggled with a  particularly fatty piece of ham.I looked across the table at Yvonne ne rvously and stood, making my way to the  living room window.I could see the colors   of Christmas blinking rhythmically in the  windows reflection and it eased my heart    somewhat, though not a lot.I swallowed  nervously as I tried to think of the best wa  y to say to my friend what I wanted to say,  because it was hard to say.Words stumbled in my mind like clumsy children falling  down a flight of stairs, and I went to the   bathroom to relieve my increasingly incessant  bladder.The smell of lilac assaulted me and I smiled softly.I sat and tinkled.The  sound reminded me of my sisters wedding.It was a grand affair, with balloons and  streamers and clowns, and my sister all dre ssed up in a brilliant white, white dress, and  the soothing tinkling sound of the raindrops in the punch bowl.I returned to find Yvonne spooning gobs of  custard into a bowl.Dessert?she  questioned.Callie shook her head.Im a vegetarian.Yvonne nodded vigorously and took her         custard to the living room.Is  something wrong?she asked me.Callie baby stepped her way to the living room.Its about my stocks.What about them?Yvonne muffled through her custard.I   Callie stammered.Her gut knotted and she took a bite of Yvonnes custard.She loved the cool fruitiness on her tongue and  she smiled softly.I want to sell them,  she finally said at last.Why?Yvonne spewed.Callie took a seat at the kitchen table.I loved Henry, she insisted, really  meaning it.But its time for me to move onto greener pastures.Yvonne shrugged voluptuously.So sell them.Ah!Callie said knowingly.Therein lies the rube.I dont want to be seen like  Im bailing out of a sinking ship.And I hear d through the cherry vine that you might be  able to help me, if you get my meaning, she hinted with knowing winks.No, Yvonne said with a deep negativity.The corners of Callies mouth droope    d like saggy breasts.Why not?she  interrogated.Because, Yvonne quipped.Because.The word reminded Callie of  grade school and Mrs.Freemans history  class where she had learned of the cotton  gin and asked why it was called a cotton gin  when it had nothing to do with gin and Mrs.Freeman glared at her as she often did and  with stern arms folded across her rigid chest   she said because and left it at that and  Callie smiled softly.Please?Callie pleaded.Im sorry, Callie, Yvonne sighed sorrowf ully.I wish I could help you but I  have my own green pastures to think a     bout.Roberto and I  what we have been a  beautiful thing.A truly beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing, and I cant risk losing such a  beautiful, beautiful, beautiful thing.Callie eyes narrowed, so imperceptibly  that no one even noticed.Even for a  friend?she warned.Youre a beautiful friend, Yvonne sighe d.   But what Roberto and I share are  more beautifully beautiful than our commonly beautiful friendship.Callie rubbed her suddenly throbbing head  with her fingertips in slow, two and   three quarter inch circles.Fine, she   half spat, one quarter shrieked, one quarter  shouted, and she snatched her coat from the couch.She flung open the door and stormed  outside, her bosom heaving with rage, stopping only long enough to smash a twinkling  Christmas light with the heel of her shoe.It was early morning in the first part   of the day.The sun was just coming up.Bruce sat at his morning breakfast table.the newspaper was in front  of him.His black  silk monogrammed dressing gown barely concealed the rippling muscles of his chest and  back.You could tell he had not shaved yet  from the dense yet attractive forest of blonde  stubble on his cleft chin and sculpted cheeks.He rubbed his aquiline nose.Then, when  he reached up to push, the soft blonde hair    back from his manly forehead, his hand  encountered the bandages still there.He frowned, the gesture making ripples   of thought on his brow between the  limpid blue pools that were his eyes.I must  remember what happened!he told himself  sternly, his deep, resonant voice trembling huskily withemotion.He still could not recall anything about the automobile accident that  had sent him to the hospital with a severe  head injury.That the bandage on his head now covered the 18 sutures that a topnotch  surgeon at St.Ivans hospital had spent so   long in carefully suturing into his brow.He  tried and tried until sweat popped out on the sm  ooth skin of his forehead and glistened  there, but he could still not remember a damn th ing!Damn it!He had to!He just had  to!Meow!said the neighbors cat at th  e window.It was not Bruces cat, but  sometimes he let it in and fed it.It was a very expensive purebred Siamese.Had the cat  but known it, his blue eyes were exactly th  e same shade of the limpid blue pools that  were Bruces eyes.Go away!shouted Bruce, his despair and confusion making him  uncharacteristically grumpy with the cat that he sometimes fed and petted.Just leave  me alone!But an instant later, he regretted his temper.He opened the window and let the  cat in.He found some milk  for it in the refrigerator, and carefully chopped up some left  over cooked chicken livers and a few sardines in  a can that was in there.The cat purred  while he ate it.Would that I could be as  sublime as you, a small feline friend?Bruce  said wearily, sadly, depressedly.He petted the cat a few times, and then went back to his  chair.He sat down on it.Outside the wi ndow, it was morning, the sun was just coming  up.The wind was blowing sweetly through the   Georgia pines.He thought, for just a  moment, how lucky he was to live in Atlanta,  Georgia in the southern part of the United  States.Suddenly, Bruces eyes fell on the newspape r on the table in front of him.The  headlines seemed to shriek at him!Millionaire Industrialist Henry Archer Dead at Age 60!Tragic Car accident claims His Life!Callie Archer now widowed!His eyes crawled frantically over the newspaper, devouring the awful and  confusing details of the death.The reporter had written a good but a gristly report on the  millionaires death.Bruce cringed as he read  of the bright star of blood on the shattered  windshield where Henry Archers head had sm ashed against it.The reporter noted that  the mans body still gripped a cell phone in one  lifeless hand after he was dead.Had he  been talking on the phone when he died?Bruce hated it when drivers in other cars talked  on the phone when they were driving.It wa  s certainly a dangerous and rude practice.Perhaps Henry Archers death had been the result of his own rudeness and carelessness in  driving while talking on a cell phone.Then his eyes were suddenly trapped like  wolves in jaw traps.One single detail  from the newspaper article seized him by the throat and squeezed like a noose around his  neck.It was the date and time of the accident.4:03 P. M.  on July 20th!No!It cant be!Bruce shouted the   words.He stood up from his chair.The  Siamese neighbors cat jumped in terror.Meow!it cried piteously.Meow!Meow!Im sorry, Pitty Pat!Bruce apologized  to the Siamese cat.I didnt mean to  startle you.But I think that Henry Archers  accident happened at the same date and time  that mine did!Oh, look at me!What am I coming to, talking to a cat?Im a successful  software developer, not some kind of a crazy man.Arent I?He stood up from his chair.He paced around the room.Then he made himself go  to his leather, monogrammed briefcase and take out the doctors report from his  hospitalization.His eyes slid swiftly down the papers, then suddenly snagged on the very  information he sought.There it was!The doctor had written down that the emergency  medical people from the ambulance that brought  him to the hospital had thought that his  accident had probably happened at 4:03 P. M.  on July 20th!The very same day and time  that Henry Archers accident had happened.He exclaimed, It has to be a coincidence!It just has to!Bruce shouted.Then  he made himself calm down.He walked back to his kitchen table a nd sat down.He looked at the newspaper  there.The bloody tragic headlines still sc  reamed their unimaginable news up at him.Below the big print of the large headline wa  s a society photo of He nry Archer and his  wife Callie Archer.Callie was in a breat htaking lace evening gown by Christian Dior.Beside her, looking stricken by his wifes  breathtaking beauty, was Henry Archer in an  impeccable black tuxedo by Ralph Lauren and  a white shirt and blacks tie.Even covered  by a tuxedo, Bruce could see that Henry Ar cher had still the muscular body of the body  builder he had once been but was no more  now that he was sixty years old.Diamonds  glittered on an immense pendant at Callie Arch ers throat.Diamonds bigger than pearls  hung from her earlobes, shining like soft icicle s.   Well, at least she will have a lot of  money now that hes dead.At least she  isnt left poor and destitute, pushing a shopping  cart down the street and living in a cardboard box in an alley and eating left over  McDonalds food from a Dumpster.At least theres that to be thankful for!Then the coincidence of the times of death hit him all over again.Can there be a  connection?he had to ask himself.Meo     w!said Pitty Pat, his soulful blue eyes  shining up at Bruce.The cat seemed to want  to help him.Cats are naturally sympathetic  animals, and Pitty Pat was no exception.He could see that the big, muscular human who  sometimes fed him chicken gizzards and salmon was distressed.His little heart went out  to the man.Meow!he said again, softly.Bruce stooped down and petted the cat.I know you want to help.Cats are  naturally sympathetic animals.I just don t think theres any way you can help me, little  fellas!I have to do this myself.I have to find out the details of my car accident.I have  to remember exactly what happened to me   that day!Im the only one who can do it,  Pitty Pat!The only one.Bruce decided to get dressed.First, he would take a shower, being very careful of  the bandage on his 12 stitches that now seamed  his forehead.He went to his bathroom.It was tiled in sandstone and umber.The    towels matched.He stepped into the hot  stinging spray of the shower, dropping his s ilken bathrobe behind him on the mat like a  discarded flower petal.He took up a big   bar of sandalwood soap and soaped the dark  mat of hair on his chest.He washed under hi s arms, and then his legs and feet.Then he  washed his arms and neck.He wished he  could shampoo his hair, but that would get his  bandage wet.So he had to not do it today.He rinsed the soap off himself and then  stepped out of his shower and toweled off.He was glad he kept his body in such good  shape.Someday, a woman would appreciate what good care he had taken of himself, and  the firm muscles that corded his bronzed   arms.Not many software developers cared what they looked like.Some of the soft   ware developers he knew looked like soggy  mushroom people who had lived too long in the  moist dark of their offices.Not Bruce.He knew that this was the only body he would ev er get and that he had to take care of it.If not for himself, then for the love a  nd admiration of the woman who would someday  share its pleasure with him.He got dressed quickly.He put on Eddie Bauer taupe slacks and a shirt in a pale  blue plaid.He pulled on a pair of black  boots.He looked good, in a rugged, out doorsy  way.You wouldnt have l     ooked at him and thought, hes a computer software  developer.You would have thought he         was a forest ranger or maybe even a  mountaineer guide.He looked at the mirror   and smiled a sad smile.Yes.He looked  tough today.But he would have to be tough, too.He knew what he should do.He should go st raight to Callie Archer.That would  get him the information he needed.Hed be  able to discover if his terrible car wreck and  Henry Archers terrible car accident were conn ected in any way.He tried not to think of  Callie Archer as she had looked in the newspaper photograph.He would not think of her  soft blonde hair in ringlets on her pale forehea d, or her soft brown eyes staring out of the  page at him.She would be well taken care  of.That was what was important, wasnt it?That she didnt end up living out on the streets now that her wealthy industrialist husband  was dead.Goodbye, Pitty Pat!he said as he left the apartment.Meow!the cat replied.It was as much  of an answer to his questions as Bruce  Lucent would get that day!The funeral had been hell.Funerals are bad enough when you don't know the dead guy  at all.And they're a pain when you just have   to show up socially or else everyone will  think you're ungrateful jerks with no respect for someone decent and kind (as all dead  guys are irregardless of how they lived their rotten, two timing sadistic, pathetic,  discombobulatedly senseless, irreligious,  unthinking, flakes, debauched, foulmouthed,  obnoxious, deviant, gross, adulterous, murd erous, gluttonous, alcoholic, lazy, indolent,  filthy, grotesquely indecent, lunatic, lives), or that you've just come for the food  afterwards or to show off your latest dress, or to spit in the coffin while nobody's looking.And funerals for true beloved dead guys     are awful because after all, someone you'd  wanted to spend your whole life with is dead  in the coffin and although he's really stiff now, you'll never get to enjoy that ever  again, and all those people around you, all that  hypocrisy and sycophant and wallflowers and showoffs are all gabbing and staring at you  and critiquing your red eyes and the running  mascara and eyeshadow and expecting you  to be brave or hold it all in or keep a sti ff upper lip or expecting you to go out with them  afterwards and let them ball you senselessly so you can forget the dead guy and fall  passionately in lust with them instead and   besides it's all so bloody expensive that it's  going to use up most of the insurance settleme   nt and the estate and then what is you  supposed to live on for hell's sake.Even worse are funerals for beloved dead guys who were married to someone else  so you have to go kind of in disguise and   make like you were just friends with the guy  instead of having wild sex with him and trying out every page of the karma sutra together  and wondering just how the heck you were   supposed to live now, although since you  aren't liable for the bloody expensive funera l you might come out more or less even or  even ahead of his wife and kids in that   department.That was the kind of funeral Irene  Stevens had gone to.And the lutz had been inconsiderate e nough to get himself killed driving Irene's  sporty little Maserati that he had bought for her    bent it and broke it and splattered it  with his blood  and ichor, all kinds of body fluids, all more or  less foul and sticky and all resonant over  what was left of the rich ripe red l  eather upholstery    though the insurance settlement  from that ought to help her get on with her     life, especially if she invested it wisely.Maybe it could finance some education so sh  e could be a model or and actresses or a  porn star or something.She'd have to talk to the guys down at the club    if she could still get into the club now that Henri was dead so she couldn't go in on his arm or to meet him  or to exercise and keep her body nice and svelte and trim and athletic for him because she  for damn sure didn't want to lose him to    some tramp like that Margaret Eastman or  whoever.That Margaret!Geez, she'd showed up at  that funeral bawling her eyes out like  they'd been best buds or lovers or so  mething.What a hypocrite.Probably hoping she  could get a job from one of his friends or   get laid by some hopeful dude there for the  widows and orphans or something.Afterwards she went back to their condo, her condo now, with the Jacuzzi and his  den and all the clothes and jewelry he'd bought her and all that high class furniture and  stuff.Henry had a thing for leather.Leather   sofas, leather chairs, a leather mattress for  hell's sake, leather underwear, the leather whips and manacles, even a braided leather  carpet that they'd made love on more than  once.She'd have to clean out the den.Henry  had not let her go in there for ages, maybe     .There were bodies in there, like in  Bluebeard: all the dismembered bodies of your  maidens that he'd carried off and secretly  ravaged before cruelly cutting them to bits.She'd stayed out of it like he said, never once  peeking into his den, so she still had all her bits, and then some.Amazing what they  could do with silicone and saline these days.His den!Henry holed up in his den like      a wild beast, hoarding his pray and  coming out to hunt when he hungered for food or  lusted for sex or thirsted for liquor or  water or will or juice.The back to his den  or out to hunt the lives and fortunes of other  men or off to his wife, that  abominable Callie Archer who took up so much of his time.But he always came back, always came back for her athletic body and her wild sex and her Margarita and tequila sunrises and omel ettes and steaks and chops and their video  tapes, the ones recorded by the hidden cameras  in the bedroom when they made love like  wild beasts, like penguins of the Sahara di ving into the sand and rutting wildly after  feasting on sand sharks.She envied those penguins.All that hot sand to swim through,  the raspy grains sliding over their feathers as   they hunted in wild packs, baying at the  moon, and diving deep, deep, down into the dusty depths of the dry smooth sand.What would penguin leather be like?W  ould it have lots of dense patterns of  whirls where the feathers grew, like ostr   ich leather did?Perhaps she could have  something made of penguin  leather to remind her of Henry, a love seat or  a fine set of whips and straps.Perhaps she  might travel to the Sahara someday to watc h them from the tops of the pyramids, Mount  Fujiyama off in the distance, duplicating the  smooth slanted sides of the pyramids.Oh,  Henry, you jerk, why didn't you ever take me     places like that?Why didn't we travel  instead of being cooped up in hiding, in your   den, rutting like penguins or ostriches or  lions on the leather cushion and couches and chairs and rugs?You used to love it when I pulled on  a leather strap around your neck when we  made love.You knew I needed you too much to ever pull too long or too hard.You loved  it when I saddled you and rode you around, when I put the bit between your teeth and the  golden spurs with the softly rounded rowels to your flanks, not enough to draw blood, but  enough to goad you on, around and around th  e condo, around the balcony and up and  down the stairs, and then we'd tumble to  gather again with you panting and sweaty and  full of lust.Perhaps I can sell the tack to someone  with a pony.But I'll keep the spurs.The  golden spurs.And the whips.Just a week before Irene Stevens came back from the funeral and decided to clean  out Henry Archers den in their condo: Henry  Archer sat in his favorite red letter chair.Irene had a thing for leather.Practically everything in the condo was leather or leather  upholstered or leather decorated or something.Henry leaned back in his red leather chair  and mused, thinking fondly  of the cow the had given it's lif e for his comfort.He wondered what this particular cow  had been like.Had it had a name.Had it  had feelings and thoughts or was it only driven  by it's own stupidity, like his last one night stand.A new thought occurred to him.What if it had been made into steak, chops, soup  bones and Macdonald's veggie burgers, also.He  remembered the steak he had eaten last  night and wondered dimly if this cow ha       d contributed to satisfying not only his  rheumatism, but his appetite as well.His thoughts strayed to the paper that was laying limply on the antique desktop in  front of him.What was it that he was going  to write?His mind seemed to be full of fog,  like the fog of New York Cit y.   He had lived there once, as a boy, before he was rich.New York made him think of other famous cities he had visited, like France and Rome.He wondered if they had cows in Rome.Henry puzzled over his letter to Irene.He had to word his thoughts just right.She was a beautiful woman, but his heart bel onged to Margaret Eastman.He loved the  way her curvatiously voluptuous body fit into he r tight nurse outfit.She was a bit older  and more cultured than Irene as well.He let out a long sigh as he thought of her.He dug around in his desk until he found a cigarette and a lighter one of the drawers.He lit up  and thought.He needed to put it delicately a nd not break her heart.Finally, he decided  on the perfect words.He put pen to  paper in the same way some men puts knives to  wrists.When he was finished he looked  over his work and smiled as he read the sentences, "Hey baby.The sex was great.But I  never liked blondes much anyway.I found someone better.Still, love ya lots, Henry. "He had to admit it.He was a Shakesp eare among Jerry Springers.He placed the  letter in an envelope and addressed it to   Irene.Then, setting the letter on his desk, he  strode out to his Mercedes to buy a diamond necklace for Margaret.Irene Stevens's tried the knob on the door of the den, Henry's wild den that he had  loved so much and been so secretive about.It  was unlocked and so sh e went in at last,  after all these months, now that Bluebird  was dead.Mahogany shelves lined one wall,  lined with canning jars full of clear fluid and cloudy lumps.There was an ebony desk and  a red leather chair.There were filing cabinet s and a large black safe.There was a rack of  pistols and rifles and shotguns, holsters for   the pistols and shoulder holsters and belts.Two of the rifles had big scopes on them.And hunting knives, and fillet knives, and buck  knives in sheathes.And cameras, a small one, like a lighter, a couple of bigger ones and  three with huge lenses and tripods.So Bluebeard did save bits, body parts.And he hunted.She looked at the jars:  pale fleshy bits and skin resolved into a  cock and balls, "hitchhiker, Cincinnati, August  1999" read one.An eyeball, "waitress, J une, June 2000. "A kidney, "roadkill, Tennessee,  May 1998. "She shuddered, but her loins warmed,  thinking of the wild beast, the hunter,  her mount ...Irene looked in the file cabinet next to   the gun rack.The top drawer was filled  with ammunition, shotgun shells, rifle bullets, pistol bullets.The rest of the drawers were  filled with papers, full of names and dates,   and pictures of people doing all kinds of  things.Some of it was porno stuff, but there were other pictures, too.The other file cabinets were much the sa me, folders of pictures and notes.Some  good porn, but a lot of it was boring stuff.There  were some letters on top of the safe, all  addressed  to post office boxes.She opene     d one and there was money inside.She  pocketed it.She'd have to go through all this stuff.There was probably money in the safe,  too.She wondered if she could sell the jars on eBay.She turned to the desk.There was just  a single envelope there and her name was  on it.She opened it.Irene read the letter and then stood there for a long, long time.She cried at first,  but then the tears slowed and a grin surfaced, a nasty grin."Last laugh, Henry.I get the last laugh.Sh e'll never have you.None of them will  have you.Ever. "And she took the packet she'd gotten at the mortuary, the very expensive one, the  one that she'd paid the embalmer so very mu ch for.There were empty jars on the bottom  shelf, and a can  labeled "alcohol, 200 proof. "She unwrapped the packet and slid the cock and balls inside  the jar, the filled it with alcohol."You're mine now, Henry.You'll always be mine. "She found a label and wrote on it: "philanderer, Atlanta, March 2004".She put the jar on the middle shelf, next to the hitchhiker.Arthur Nance looked at the clipboard, in his hand.As the main doctor at the  hospital where he worked to save people' lives it was his duty to tell them about their  disease and injuries.But he didn't want to talk to Bruce Lucent.Bruce was a big  important software developer and didn't like  it when people or things didn't go his way.So Arthur news wouldn't be taken well.He wandered to the hospital cafeteria where he got a ham sandwich to eat because  he was very hungry, it had been a very long da y and he'd had to perform surgery on two  different people since he had got to the hosp ital early that mourning.One had had a heart  attack and needed open heart surgery and the other had to have her appendices out.She  had been very pretty and he had to tell hims elf not to think about that because he had to  concentrate to take out her appendix.He ate his sandwich quickly and then got a Diet Doctor Pepper to drink.It was his  favorite and he got worried sometimes that    he was addicted to the sweet caffeinated  drink.Arthur looked at his watch.Seven fift een it was time to check on the people on  Intensive care.Including Bruce Lucent, he just  couldn't get away from him.He turned,  which way was his room again?Oh yeah it  was in the south wing.Arthur Nance turned  and started marching down the hall towards Bruce's room.He sighed as he marched down the hall   towards Bruce's room.On the way he  passed a pretty nurse Margaret Eastman.He   stared at her beautiful curves then cursed  himself silently for staring at her.It just wa sn't proper.But it was hard not to stare at her  luminously curvaceous body and her soft curvy cleavage, she was so pretty.That was the  problem, with this hospital too many pretty  nurses and patience were here.Maybe he'd  ask her out to lunch or something sometime.As he continued marching down the hall Ma rgaret turned to him.Hey she said."Didn't I see you earlier, you were taking care of Bruce Lucent?"she queried, looking at  his nice thick muscles.He was pretty hot  she thought, maybe she would ask him to lunch  but not now."He was in the car accident with   Henry Archer last week wasn't he," she  asked him, looking him up and down now.Oh y eah, she was hot, with all those muscles.What a stud.But she wasn't looking for him.she was looking for Lucent,  maybe he could tell her who Irene Stevens wa s, Henry never really had but she had seen  her name on his address list.Arthur Nance took a drink of  his coke, savoring the cool sweet drink as is fizzed  down his throat.Yeah he was probably addict ed but he didn't really care, stress would kill him anyway, or maybe a car crash cause th  ere were a lot of them these days, there  had been 2 in the past week, Bruce and Henry's.He would probably take up smoking  cigarettes if his boss hadn't yelled at peopl e who smoked and fired them.
