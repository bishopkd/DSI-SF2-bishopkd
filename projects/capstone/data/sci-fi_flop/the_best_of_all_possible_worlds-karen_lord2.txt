Dr.Mar and Second Assistant Delarua seem to be engaged in some kind of female bonding ritual.In my office?came Dllenahkhs bemused reply.I think both of us were picturing the expression on his face, because we went off into another giggle loop that put paid to any lingering illusion of professionalism.Fortunately, that wasnt the final farewell.We had a nice, sober proper seeing off a week later at the main train station in the city.Gilda was there, and Dr.Lanuri and Freyda.I hugged Gilda hard, making a mental note to send many souvenir trinkets to her kids, and got cheek smooches from Freyda, all the while thinking, Im drinking buddies with Freyda Mar!How cool is that!We clasped arms briefly and exchanged looks.Hers said, Dont tell anyone how pathetic I am, and mine said, Hang in there, youre not pathetic, youll be fine.The three Sadiri men, Lanuri, Dllenahkh, and Joral, stood slightly apart, making their somber farewells, far more absorbed in the meaning of the mission and their hopes for its success than in any trivial sadness over the temporary absence of a colleague.I felt a little jolt when I looked at them, a sudden awareness of the insane reality that had brought them here, a flash of insight into how death and devastation had completely reshaped their lives and destinies.Like Freyda, I suddenly felt foolish for being annoyed at them over a small matter of unrequited love.We boarded and found our seats.I leaned my head against the window by my seat, looking at Freyda as she lingered to give us a final wave and blinking back tears.Silly matchmakingand now she would have a year to suffer through, pretending her feelings didnt exist.I was vexed with Dllenahkh.Dangling an emotionally unavailable Sadiri male in front of herhah; that was a tautology if there ever was onewas more than cruel, it was irresponsible.I thought of the messed up attempts at courting that had left tangles even the ministry wouldnt be able to unsnarl.Would any of them be capable of forming normal unions, unions based on more than a desperate need to keep their cultural and genetic heritage alive?Did the Sadiri ever admit to needing therapy?My struggle with my emotions did not go unnoticed.You will miss Dr.Freyda Mar very much, said Joral, examining my face curiously.Yes, I said, my tone firm, calm, and neutral.I wish I could have had more time to work with her.Joral nodded in understanding.Dr.Lanuri speaks of her often.I believe he finds her to be almost Sadiri in her clarity and depth of thought.Furthermore, he says that her appearance is very pleasing and in many aspects reminiscent of his late wife Joral, Dllenahkh chided.But it is true.I am only repeating what Dr.Lanuri has said on several I stared at him as suddenly all the fragments that I knew came together in a gestalt that looked nothing like what I had at first assumed.Joral, said Dllenahkh sternly.It is not appropriate to discuss Joral, youve got more sense than any of us!I cried.I jumped up and ran to the door, paused with a skid, went back to grab the startled youngster around the face and plant a kiss on his forehead, then took off again.Freyda was just turning to leave the platform.I thundered toward her, and she looked back at me in shock.He loves you, you remind him of his wife, hell never admit it, its a stupid Sadiri thing, its up to yougo, go, GO!She gaped at me, her eyes gradually widening during my whispered babble and ending up filling with tears, the jaw drop becoming a wide grin.I squeezed a quick hug around her shoulders and ran back to slither through the carriage doors before they slid shut.I returned to my seat with a small smile of bittersweet triumph.Dllenahkh looked at me with a strange expression that I couldnt quite read, but I didnt care.I was thinking about the year ahead and hoping for at least one happy ending for a friend.Joral leaned forward and said earnestly, You seem to be very sad about leaving.It is all right if you wish to cry, First Officer Delarua.We will not think badly of you.We understand that this is common behavior for many Terran females.Well, Im Cygnian, I snapped.And I wasnt going to cry.I swear, nothing irritates me more than being overemotional in front of a Sadiri.They make you feel so silly.Dllenahkh coughed almost apologetically.First Officer Delarua, at one stage you suggested that I had complicated your life by asking for you to be assigned to this mission.Is it now the case that you are beginning to enjoy the complications?Thats an almost Cygnian streak of smug bastardness youre displaying there, Dllenahkh, I warned with a small, rueful grin of acknowledgment.He straightened slightly, and his eyebrows rose by a fraction at the sly insult.Then the train pulled out and we were off to start our grand adventure, around the world in one Standard year.Zero hour plus eleven months twenty eight days Standard Time was invented by Sadiri pilots.Most Sadiri procedures and quantification followed straight lines and linear progressions, created for the convenience of the ten fingered.But TimeTime belonged to a higher realm.It could not be carried in human hands, not while it constantly carried human minds.It was all circles, wheels within wheels, a Standard year of three hundred sixty Standard days coiled up in twelve months, which in turn were composed of the small whirlings of twelve hours day and twelve hours night, tiny spinning minutes and seconds, ever cycling breaths and blinks and beats.To be described as having a pilots mind was both curse and compliment; it could mean being unable to tell the difference between prophecy, memory, and mere dj vu.Dllenahkh knew that it was almost one Standard year since the destruction of his home and his life.He knew it not like a memory but like the vague dread of a possible death, a death yet to come.He left the thought and the feeling while he could still breathe and focused instead on the present.The train vibrated gently, its windows filled with the rich black of a moonless night in deep country.Delarua had already retired to the sleeping car, leaving them to continue their work.Dllenahkh looked into the soothing darkness, then made himself examine his handheld screen once again.The ambient light was too dim and the screen overbright, but perhaps, he admitted, that was not where the fault lay.The minute tension around his eyes might be caused by the fact that he was staring too intently at the reports and briefs, as if willing them to create the world he wanted to exist.Behind closed doors, the council had wrangled over the mission proposal with a pettiness and lack of direction to rival the callow youths they claimed to represent and govern.Then again, from what he had heard and seen, the Government of New Sadira was hardly doing any better, something that he found reassuring and dismaying in equal measure.If the Cygnian Governments response had been the least bit lukewarm, the mission would have been dropped for good, but they had been enthusiastic, offering specialists, funding, and resources until the project gathered unstoppable momentum and even the most cynical councillors softened.Hope: that was the key.They were all clutching at straws, despairing and drowning, then clutching at a fresh set of straws.It was exhausting.It was all they had.Naraldi said it was important to keep moving forwardyes, forward, one clutched straw at a time.Highly ironic advice, considering, but useful nonetheless and something to hold on to now that Naraldi was off on his own mission, beyond the reach of any comm or courier.His last words, perhaps?No, never that.He expected that Naraldi would have a safe journey and a safe return.What was one more straw to add to all the rest?First Officer Delarua is not what I expected, Joral mused.Dllenahkh kept his head bent over the mission schedule.Sometimes it was best not to engage when Joral indulged in his habit of thinking aloud.She kissed me.Dllenahkh glanced up at the young man.As a statement it was innocuous, but Jorals face held that anxiously pondering expression he used whenever women were being discussed.She is too old for you, he replied firmly though not unkindly.Now, let us go over the Acora, Sibon, and Candir briefs again.I would like us to be fully prepared when we meet our new colleagues.A MEANS TO OTHER ENDS We have a doctor on this team, I said through gritted teeth.Dllenahkh raised his head for a momentary glance.We have a Commissioner who is an anthropologist and a geneticist.Such expertise is not necessary for trivial injuries.The only expertise Dr.Daniyel had that I wanted was the skill of understanding my need to howl shamelessly while having centimeter long spines picked out of my palm.I hissed and twitched as Dllenahkhs tweezers probed too deeply.He gave me a tired look, firmly positioned my wrist between his knees, and gripped.Then he held the tips of my fingers and applied the tweezers with a will.I twisted in my chair, turned my head into the crook of the elbow of my uninjured arm, and kept it there.You may cry out if it makes you more comfortable, he said kindly.It was only the movement that was problematic.Im good, I whimpered.After a few more minutes of torture, the barbaric antique tweezers were laid aside and a modern medical scanner was passed over my hand.Having satisfied himself that the wounds were indeed clear of debris, Dllenahkh picked up another instrument and began to seal the punctures and lacerations.I emerged from hiding, sighing with the bliss of the absence of pain, and slowly flexed my hand.I would recommend that you stay away from that particular plant in future.No disagreement here, I said firmly.She only did it to get out of her turn at poling the punt, Lian said to Joral with a laugh.They were at the back of the shuttle, unloading the last set of supplies from storage.Mm hm.That elegant trip and fall was all part of my cunning plan, I said with distracted cheerfulness as I cautiously ran exploring fingers over my healed skin.Lian and Joral went out, carrying a box between them.In a few minutes, having reassembled and put away the medkit, Dllenahkh also left.I gave my hand one final pat and was about to join them when Joral came back into the shuttle, a slightly furtive expression on his face.He slid into the chair beside me and placed his hands flat on his knees with an air of resolve.First Officer Delarua, is Lian male or female?I looked at Joral in utter shock.That is not a question you should ask anyone but Lian.In fact, I dont even think you should ask Lian that.Why do you even need to know?Lian is highly intelligent and has features that are visually pleasing, but I do not know whether it would be appropriate to Joral, should you really be assessing the wife potential of every female you meet?He looked slightly abashed.Such matters would have been arranged for me before, but now, with things as they are, it makes sense for me to review all possible options.He began to tap his fingers on his knee, counting.Nasiha is already bonded, you are too oldat least too old for meDr.Daniyel is definitely too old, and that leaves Lian by a simple process of eliminationif, of course, Lian is female.Joral, I said quietly.A word to the wise.First, it is best to steer clear of any assessment or discussion that uses the phrase too old to describe a woman.Second, fraternizing with members of the mission team is not recommended.We will have to live as close as family while maintaining a high standard of professionalism.Complications would not be helpful.Joral looked at me apprehensively.He had already learned that it was not a good sign when I spoke slowly and quietly.I will take your advice, First Officer Delarua.Good.Now, Lian isLian.Lian has chosen to live without reference to gender.This may or may not mean that Lian is asexual, though many of those who are registered as gender neutral are indeed so.However, it doesnt matter, because this has no bearing on our mission and is thus none of our business.Now come on.Theyre waiting for us.My little tumble has put our whole schedule out of whack.It was a bit of an exaggeration.Things were proceeding as usual outside the shuttle.Nasiha and Tarik, the Sadiri married couple on loan from the Interplanetary Science Council, were securing equipment on the pallet that held our supplies.Dr.Daniyel was talking to Lian, and Lian was making notes on a handheld computer with a stylus.Dllenahkh also had a handheld and appeared to be recording a memo in a low murmur.Then there was Fergus tweaking some last clamp on one of the punts and Joral and myself bringing up the rear with the last box of supplies wed need for this trip.We were a motley crew, with two Sadiri in dark blue Science Council uniforms, the Cygnians in Civil Service gray and green (semiformal yet serviceable gear courtesy of the Division of Forestry and Grasslands), and the two remaining Sadiri in beige and dark brown civvies.Fergus, our security and survival specialist, attracted our attention by clearing his throat and began his briefing.They say its unlucky to urinate in the waters of Candir, he said.Its true.Theres a parasitic fish in the river thatll swim up your urethra and get wedged in good and proper.Very painful.Dont risk it, but if you must, the Commissioner might be able to remove it without calling for medevac.The smirk that had appeared on my face at the word urinate slowly transformed into a look of sheer horror; my smothered chuckle ended in a sickened gulp.Oh.Youre not joking, are you?Fergus scowled down at me from his two meter plus height.I do not joke.My job is not a joking matter.Okay, I murmured meekly.Pincushion plants and perverted parasitic fish.I could tell this place was going to be lovely.Fortunately, my strong right arm was not needed to bring us to our destination before the darkening of twilight.Weor, rather, the rest of the teampoled our three small craft to a central platform in the middle of the tree fringed marshes and moored them carefully.Fergus boarded first and helped Dr.Daniyel up.As we gathered together on the platform, we gazed about at the houses: simple structures on piles, some with steps going down to small vessels moored underneath, and other, larger residences connected to the main platform by boardwalks.The water was flat and rich with moss and weed that tinted the crisply mirrored images of the houses with a green glass sheen.The place was quiet, as if all were in the middle of a siesta.Do we call out?Ring something?Lian asked uncertainly.No, said Tarik.We have been seen.His voice sounded a little strange, but when I saw the canoe and the people who were paddling it, I understood.Thus far, we had visited two settlements, both of which had indeed registered a significant amount of taSadiri heritage according to Dr.Daniyels genetic tests but whose inhabitants had in culture and appearance so resembled the average Cygnian as to be unremarkable.These ones, nowthey had the hair.We set up our government issue shelters on a spare platform (civil servants are discouraged from accepting hospitality when on duty in case of bias or conflict of interest).It was quite comfortable.The marsh was fed mainly by outflows from the Candir, and it did not rain during the time we were there.Screens and repellent kept the biting insects away, and filters made collecting potable water as simple as leaning over the platforms edge.Their sewage system was excellent, its tubing tucked away behind piles and under boardwalks leading to a treatment area some distance away on dry land.I took notes.I intended to keep up to date in my own field as much as possible.When Dr.Daniyel finished taking the blood and tissue samples she needed, I went with her back to our landing site and we worked in the minilab that had been purpose built into the shuttle for the mission.It wasnt really my field, but some kinds of lab skills are pretty elementary, so I ended up helping a fair bit.It was a good thing too.I observed Dr.Daniyel and realized that something wasnt quite right.She leaned over her work in a way that spoke not of absorption but of exhaustion.Youll get your own DNA in the samples if youre not careful, I said lightly.Perhaps you should take a break.Dr.Daniyel pulled her graying locs over one shoulder with a slow weariness that was oddly graceful, then stepped back to let me help with the analysis.There will be time to rest after the missions done.Ive been pushing for a global genetic registry for years now.Perhaps this can be the start of it.Its early in the mission.You mustnt forget to pace yourself, I said, expressing my concern with care.I didnt want to appear to be telling my boss she looked unfit for command.Oh, this?She smiled, waving a hand at herself.Chronic.Still within Service parameters, but I do have a condition that makes me tire quite easily.Thats why I have Lian for the heavy lifting, but as for the rest of it, Im pretty much the only person with the skill and experience for this job.I adjusted the meters and toggled the last few switches.There.That should do it.I looked at her.With all due respect, maam, I can get the results later and save them to your files for you.She seemed amused and gratified at my solicitude, which was good because it could have gone either way, but then her face changed.Aggregated data, she said, her voice suddenly alert and firm.We dont do individual scans.This is an anthropological analysis, not a medical report.Yes, maam.I am familiar with the bioethics section of the Science Code, I answered calmly.She smiled once more, not offended at being humored.Its going to be a long mission.Feel free to call me Qeturah when off duty.Im Grace, I responded.But everyone calls me Delarua regardless.The results were interesting.These Cygnians did not possess a greater percentage of taSadiri genes compared with those in the last two settlements, appearance notwithstanding (genetics can be a funny potluck, let me tell you), but what they did have was a surprising amount of cultural integrity.Tarik and Nasiha went off to speak to the people, recording words, stories, myths, and customs in a far more detailed and directed manner than Cygnian anthropologists had yet accomplished.Of course, they had something we didnt, a knowledge of some of the more obscure and ancient Sadiri dialects, and with that they were able to make far more connections and discoveries than we could.Once the bio tests were all finished, there wasnt much for me to do, but our stay was extended so that Dr.Daniyel could satisfy herself with more anthropological data and the Sadiri could explore the potential for links between their settlements.For a few days, I just relaxed and took it in.Sometimes Id watch Joral, who was ostensibly helping the Science Council officers or taking minutes at meetings for Dllenahkh, butquite honestly?Checking out the girls.It was an education in Sadiri flirting.One in particular must have been his favorite, because he all but disassembled one of the biosensors in order to spend time explaining its workings to her.Sadiri mating displays seemed to consist of flashing bright mental plumage at the object of desire in as cool and disinterested a fashion as possible.Otherwise, Id sit on the edge of a balcony staring at the mesmerizingly slow flow of the green water and hearingoverhearing, reallyDllenahkh debating some principle of Sadiri philosophy with the settlements Chief Councillor, Darithiven.Of all the humans of the galaxy, we Sadiri have developed the greatest mental capacity, Dllenahkh contended.We have realized our potential through use of the disciplines, which enable us to control our thoughts, emotions, and urges and improve our ability to process data.Without the disciplines we might still be powerful, but we would be rudderless.Darithiven smiled the slightly condescending smile of a man who is prepared to humor his opponent but not to yield the argument.Your disciplines are indeed impressive.Your pilots use them to navigate ships on interstellar routes, and because of them all Sadiri have acquired a reputation for impartiality and diligence.Even now, our systems of justice and scientific endeavor continue to be headed by Sadiri.But here we live simpler lives, with less to trouble our minds.We need only enough self control to maintain a harmonious society.He extended his arms, embracing the view of his settlement and his people like a proud father.Dllenahkh actually hesitated before replying.Your settlement is indeed well organized and efficiently run.But there is more to the world, to the universe, than these waters.Perhaps you do not wish to explore the galaxy yourself, but what of your children and your childrens children?The earlier certain things are taught The Chief Councillor shook his head and interrupted gently.I hope you are not implying that we limit our children by what we teach or do not teach.We have our own version of the disciplines, and they are not lacking in rigor.It is simply that our goals differ.Is that so inappropriate?By this time, Id be almost slipping into the water from boredom as they went back and forth on the question of the scope and purpose of the Sadiri disciplines.I could see Darithivens point.To tell the truth, this was one of the sleepiest settlements Id ever encountered.People kept to themselves, not in an unfriendly fashion but as if truly uninterested in our presence.We saw them coming and goingmen up to the river to fish, women to the nearby rice paddies and the other crop fields south of the marshes, the remainder busy at home with their arts, crafts, studies, or whatever else they chose to occupy themselves with.Whatever form of mental discipline they employed, it clearly worked for them.The settlement had the same atmosphere of measured efficiency that Id encountered on the Sadiri homesteadings of my own province.How are the talks going?I asked Dllenahkh.His eyes lit up.It has been most intriguing.They are, of course, quite attached to their simplified variant of the disciplines, but I believe in time some of them could be persuaded to return to the orthodox methods practiced by most Sadiri.I gave him a look.Mmm hm.So will your guys come here or will they go to you?They would encourage males from our homesteadings to come here and are willing to send in exchange groups that would be mostly female.Sounds reasonable.Well done, I congratulated him.I was a little chagrined, actually.Id been so cynical about this mission, and here we were, already third time lucky.It wasnt storybook perfectI could tell theyd be debating for generations to comebut at least there was a foundation.Dr.Daniyel told us at our evening meeting that it was time to wrap up and move on to explore other areas.Dllenahkh, Nasiha, and Tarik reluctantly agreed.When I looked at their faces, I remembered Dllenahkh saying to me that all Sadiri shared a low level telepathic bond.If that were indeed the case, visiting the marshes of Candir must have been like being immersed in a constant buzz of subtle connection.I could understand why they would be hesitant to leave.Joral didnt want to leave at all.I have already identified two potential candidates for betrothal in the five days we have been here.Surely it would be worthwhile for me to remain and gather more anthropological data.This could assist our homesteaders in making an informed choice as to whether they should remove here or no.Dr.Daniyel shot a sharp look at Dllenahkh, which he missed because he was already frowning at Joral.I smiled to myself, waiting to hear him tell the young Sadiri to be patient, to remain disciplined, and to focus on the mission.Joral, no.But Councillor Dllen I said no.Lian and I looked at each other, ludicrously wide eyed with shock and amusement.Dr.Daniyels lips twitched, but she said nothing.That was when the commotion started outside: shouting, the thud of running steps on the wood of the boardwalk, a womans scream.Fergus was first out, Lian close behind, but we all scrambled to see what the fuss was about.There was still sunlight at that hour, though the long shadows of the trees and houses darkened the waters.A small fishing boat was drawing up to one of the walkways.The smell that came from it was not the odor of gutted fish but the strong metallic tang of blood.A hand trailed carelessly over the side into the water, and the sickly gray hue that overcast the skin was visible even from where we stood.People gathered around, and the shouts grew louder.Whats happening?said Dr.Daniyel at my ear.Their boat was attacked, I said, listening and translating the fragmented, overlapping speech into a coherent explanation.Theres another settlement off a tributary upriver, and theyve quarreled over fishing rights for some time, it seems.II think that mans dead.Theyre talking about going to the other settlement for I paused.I couldnt believe the word I had just heard.Id heard the words in Sadiri separately but never together, and so it was with a panicked glance at Dllenahkh that I said, Blood price?Price for blood?Price in blood?Dllenahkh gave me a look I could not understand.Sorrow?Shame?But he did not correct me.Theres Darithiven, said Nasiha suddenly.It was indeed the Chief Councillor of the settlement, and he had to pass us to reach the fishing boat.His gaze flashed across to us, he hesitated, then he appeared to make a decision and came toward us.May we be of assistance, Chief Councillor Darithiven?Dr.Daniyel asked immediately.He was already shaking his head.A small matter, a local matter.It is nothing new.We can manage without outside interference.I grabbed the hard muscle of Ferguss arm.A muted glint of edged metal had appeared amid the crowdand there again, a blade in one hand, a spear in another.I see it, Fergus said gruffly.He exchanged a look with Lian, and I saw them release the catches on their holsters and adjust their pistols to a high but nonlethal setting.Darithiven saw it too, and his expression was resigned but approving.You have your own security.That is wise.Now I must leave you.There is much anger here, and it must be appropriately directed.We have had too many incursions into our waters, and it is time to deal with the culprits sternly.There are other, civilized ways of dealing with the matter, Dllenahkh insisted.Darithiven looked at him with pity.Then, by your definition, this cannot be civilization.He strode off toward the gathering mob.Nasiha inhaled sharply and began to whisper to Tarik.Their stance changed from relaxed stillness to defensive tension as they drew closer to each other.What is it?I demanded.Their behavior irritated me.Perhaps it was because they were both spouses and colleagues, but they were such an annoyingly cozy little self contained unit.My Sadiri, as I had labeled Dllenahkh and Joral in my head, understood the simple courtesy of explaining themselves from time to time.They are making themselves angry, Dllenahkh muttered, profoundly disturbed, as he stared at the growing crowd.They have lowered mental shields to each other and are projecting and augmenting a desire to fight and kill.Suddenly, his head snapped to Joral, who stood stiffly, breathing heavily, his fists clenching spasmodically at his sides.Joral!Remember your disciplines!It isdifficult, Councillor Dllenahkh, Joral admitted.Stand with Commander Nasiha and Lieutenant Tarik, Dllenahkh ordered.Before I could ask him why he didnt follow his own advice, he started off in the direction of the crowd, saying, I must stop this.No!shouted Dr.Daniyel.To my shock, Dllenahkh ignored her and walked on.I wavered, eyeing her, hoping for permission, however subtly conveyed, to go after him.Instead she did the sensible thing and actually followed our mission protocols.Lian, Fergus, get everything essential into the punts.We must get ready to leave as soon as possible.Delarua, find Darithiven for me.I have a few things to say to him.I noticed that she did not issue orders to Tarik and Nasiha, but she did give them one of her sharp looks.It seemed to break them out of their cocoon because they started to help Lian and Fergus while keeping an eye on Joral.He followed them meekly, still looking shaky.I dashed off along a path, already knowing where to go.Darithiven was not far away.He stood on the balcony of his residence and surveyed the scene below with an unsettling expression.It was not peace exactly, butsatisfaction?A sense of seeing something come to pass that had been planned for a long time?As I halted halfway up the steps, he looked down his nose at me as if I were something small and unimportant come to bother him.I glared back.I would not allow him to forget that whatever rank he held in his own little patch of marsh, Dr.Daniyel and I represented the government that allowed him to exercise that rank.The Commissioner wishes to speak to you, I growled.Now.Dr.Daniyel was waiting on the central platform.She stood meditatively with arms folded and head slightly bowed.She looked calm and resolute.I knew she was tired.Thank you, First Officer Delarua.Please inform Councillor Dllenahkh that we are ready to leave.Lian, go with Delarua.As we rushed off, I heard her begin to speak to Darithiven in the slow, disappointed tones of a scolding parent.As it seems you can no longer guarantee the safety of my team Where is Dllenahkh?Lian said, glancing about nervously.I stared.I couldnt see him either, and I didnt relish going into the middle of that loud, surging mass.There!I pointed to the edge of the crowd.He had stepped up onto a low balcony and was speaking with two of the older men.Their faces were masks of bitter fury, his a study in intense determination, as if he expected to persuade them through sheer force of will.I shouted to him, my voice thin and distant in all the noise, and he did hear me, but he looked at me with a brief, dismissing glance and went back to his argument.Damn, I said.Let me, Lian said grimly.Long soldier strides took Lian to Dllenahkhs side in seconds.I followed close behind.Come with us, Councillor Dllenahkh.The Commissioners orders, Lian said simply and quietly.Not yet, Lian, I must Not a request, Councillor Dllenahkh, Lian replied.It was only when I saw Dllenahkh flinch ever so slightly that I realized Lian had nudged the pistol into his ribs.His lips pressed together, the one angry sign in a face that refused even now to lose control.I see, was all he said.Lets go, I squeaked, agitated by the atmosphere around us, and we walked away briskly, unchallenged and unmolested in the growing maelstrom of anger that was, thankfully, not directed at us.It felt like a retreat.It was all done according to procedure, but it felt like a retreat.Lian sent off a preliminary bulletin to the nearest government outpost so that the situation could be monitored by the appropriate authorities.Dr.Daniyel sent a more detailed report the moment we returned to the shuttle.Nasiha, Tarik, and poor Joral were clearly relieved, their condition improving the farther we traveled from the marshes.Fergus was pleased that the bug out drill he had insisted on had been used so early in the mission and had worked so well.Dllenahkh I didnt dare look at Dllenahkh.When I finally, furtively glanced at him just as the shuttle was taking off, his face was impassive, his demeanor as calm and controlled as ever.I knew he felt my gaze, but he did not meet my eyes.We flew for a little less than an hour before landing near our next destination, a bit of savanna country farther south.Fergus set out perimeter alarms while we wearily put up our shelters and sought sleep.We did everything right.It still felt like a retreat.When I woke up the next morning, emotion came before memory, so my first coherent thought was to wonder if it was a hangover that had me feeling so miserable.Then I remembered the previous day and felt thoroughly sick.I pulled myself together, freshened up, and went to see if Dr.Daniyel needed me for anything, but Lian said she was still sleeping, so I went away again with a vague idea of checking on Joral.He was sitting in a meditation posture in the doorway of the shelter he shared with Dllenahkh.I hesitated when I saw him, not wanting to disturb him, especially given the mental turmoil he had so recently experienced.I must have trodden too heavily, however, for he opened his eyes and stared at me.First Officer Delarua, he said.Joral.Are you well?I asked formally and in Sadiri.I am well, he replied in a steady voice.Before I could exhale in relief, he continued, But Councillor Dllenahkh will not get up.Beg pardon?I said in Standard, genuinely confused as to his meaning.Still speaking Sadiri, Joral tried for greater precision.It is possible that he is awake, but his eyes are not open, he is not moving, and his mindhis mind is closed.I stood still, completely at a loss.What do you want me to do?I do not know, he replied with simple honesty.Nasiha, Tarik I began.He would not wish them to see him like this.Something about the way he said it gave me a clue.This has happened before, I accused him, a statement, not a question.He nodded, stood up, and stepped aside, leaving the way clear for me to enter.I stared at him then went in slowly, not knowing what to expect.Dllenahkh lay on his side in the narrow government issue cot, not quite fetal but certainly curled into himself, the blanket pulled up to just below a bare shoulder.There were signs that he was awake.The firm grip of his left hand on his right wrist, the tension around his eyes as his eyelids pressed tightly closed, and his shallow, uneven breathing all spoke of distress.I knelt by his head, too astonished to feel awkward.Dllenahkh?Will you get up?Feeble, I know, but amazingly it got a response.I am tired, he said slowly.Leave me alone.For some reason, I dont think I should, I replied.To my own incredulous ears, my voice sounded as ordinary as if discussing an inspection checklist.I think you should get up and come for a walk with me.He remained still for a while, but his eyes opened, though they kept looking carefully past me.I glanced around for something to help restart the conversation and saw an undershirt and tunic neatly folded nearby.Trust a Sadiri to have a breakdown but still not neglect the small domestic rituals.Heres your shirt, I said inanely.Lets put it on, shall we?Still looking away, he heaved a great sigh and sat up slowly.He allowed me to maneuver the undershirt over his head, then heavily moved his arms to finish putting it on.His hair was mussed, and I resisted the urge to pat it back into place.Whats happened to you?I whispered.Overextended myself, he mumbled.So much anger back there.So tiring to keep it out.I knew there was more to it than that, but I said nothing, only handed him the tunic and looked around for his boots.There, I said at last with a weak attempt at cheerfulness.Youre all ready.Lets go.Joral joined us as we came outside, discreetly ignoring his superiors rumpled appearanceor so I thought.Then I realized he was distracted by Lian.Already dressed, the Commissioners aide was trotting past with biosensor in hand.Somethings tripped a perimeter alarm, Lian explained.Fergus is on it, but he wanted a sensor reading to be sure.I was glad for the diversion.We could pretend we were still functional when lurching from crisis to crisis; it was the time for quiet and introspection that was dangerous.We jogged along behind, following Lian up a low hill to where Fergus was already in place, half kneeling with his pistol held point down but ready.He gestured for us to approach cautiously.I didnt see it at first against the blond color of the grass, but then it moveda short haired animal rather like a wild dog in size and shape.The creature snuffled around briefly, tossed its head in the air as if sneezing from the dust, and then turned away to lope down the other side of the hill.Joral was the first to unfreeze.Mute, expressionless, he simply turned around and quickly went back the way we had come.I watched him go, frowning in puzzlement.Wild dog?Lian asked in hushed tones.Savanna dog.Ive never seen one before, but I hear they show up sometimes in this region, Fergus said.They shouldnt be any trouble as long as we dont bother their pups.The two Science Council officers came rushing up the hill with Joral, biosensors at the ready.We followed them as they swept ahead for readings, followed them right to the sloping crest of the hill, and crouched there, obedient to their silent, frantic hand signals.I peeked through the coarse grass that fringed the crumbling edge and saw them: a small pack of dogs comfortably at home in the den they had made, sheltered and safe in the cleft of a small valley.No, said Dllenahkh.His voice sounded so strange that I looked at him sharply, immediately afraid that he was slipping into that frozen depression again.He felt my concerned gaze and turned to me.No, he repeated with the most brilliant and beautiful smile that I never expected to see on a Sadiri.Not a savanna dog.Sadiri.Look.He gazed down intently into the valley, and one by one, first adults and then pups, they went from a panting, relaxed demeanor to closed jawed alertness.Their noses pointed inquiringly at the airWho?Who?Then they looked at Dllenahkh, looked straight at him through all the brush and grass.Their jaws relaxed once more as if grinning in welcome, and their short whiplike tails thumped the ground and whisked the grass in slow, cautious approval.Sadiri dogs, so far from home, murmured Dllenahkh.The taSadiri must have brought them.So few remain now.The Science Council keeps them under protection.Nasiha and Tarik did not once take their eyes off the scene below them, nor did they set down their biosensors, but their free hands met and clasped together with a quiet passion that was like a promise.Jorals face was more conflicted: subtle shades of anger and grief mingled with awe and gratitude.Dllenahkhthe first brilliance had faded, tempered with sorrowful acceptance, but still he smiled.I dont know how long the team stayed on the hillthe Cygnians watching the Sadiri, the Sadiri watching the dogs.I left them there and went for a short walk and a cry before going back to camp.I wanted to be the first to tell Dr.Daniyel all about it when she woke up.HAPPY FAMILIES So, I said to Qeturah, I have this friend She gave me a smile.It was the classic opening line for any counseling session.Go on, she prompted.Well, theyve got some fairly strict ethics about stuff liketelepathy and emotional control and such.They feel pretty strongly about it.Thing is, theyve had to deal with a situation where someone was operating without those ethics.I see, she said.Did they feel vulnerable in this situation?Maybe they did.Maybe they felt they were strong enough to handle any direct attack.But I think whats worse is that they felt responsible for others who might be hurt by this person.The person without the ethical standards, she queried.Yes.Because no one else seemed to think that there was anything wrong with how that person was behaving.Maybe they couldnt see it, or maybe they thought it was normal.I dont know.I think Im kind of afraid to ask.What do you want for your friend?she asked quietly.I want them to feellike they dont always have to be responsible for other people.Like its okay to not be the strong one all the time.Maybe even okay to ask for help.She was silent for a while.Well, she said carefully, you can let your friend know that if they ever want to ask for help, Im here to listen, I wont judge, and I have ways of getting things done without breaching confidentiality.I swallowed, feeling a thickness in my throat.Yes, maam.Thank you.I hope I can get my friend to come talk to you directly.Some people might think its kind of strange having your boss also be your doctor and psychiatrist, but we were a small team and Qeturah was a very good small team leader.She took an interest in everyone, and she knew instinctively which voice to use and which hat to wear in which context.There were a lot of hats to juggle over the next few days.Central Government wanted the Sadiri and the Commissioner to come in for an inquiry about the situation in Candir, which remained volatile.The day after the flight from Candir, we were off to Ophir, the nearest town with full facilities for teleconferencing.Dllenahkh gave his brief testimony first.There was a Sadiri savant among the investigators, and though he spoke little, he looked at Dllenahkh as if cataloging any and every sign of unusual behavior.Superficially, Dllenahkh seemed fine to me apart from an air of constant preoccupation, yet I was aware that unexpectedly discovering a much loved breed of hometown fauna isnt really what you might call a complete cure.That Sadiri savant must have seen something I missed, because during the tea break, Qeturah was kept in for a brief private consultation that then turned into orders for me.Delarua, you know the Montserrat region pretty well?she said as soon as she emerged from the meeting room.Ive got some family there; why?I asked.Instinct honed by years of experience in the Civil Service made me drain my teacup and reach for an extra slice of cake to add to my napkin.It was good cake, and I didnt want a little thing like duty getting in the way of enjoying it.I want you to go with Councillor Dllenahkh to the Benedictine monastery at Montserrat.Theyve got a Sadiri priest and some monks housed there, and theyll help him realign his nodes or reverse his polarity or whatever it is he needs done to him.Fergus will fly you in today and pick you up Sunday afternoon.Serendipity and guilt knocked jointly on my conscience.Umits a silent monastery.Do you need me to stay there with him or just take him there?Qeturah frowned slightly.I thought he was your friend.I want to have someone nearby to check on him, and youre a familiar face.We cant spare Joral; hes got all the reports of their meetings.I felt even guiltier.No, I didnt meanWhat I meant was, d you mind if I take a couple of days to visit my sister?Ill make sure Dllenahkh can reach me at any time, and Ill get her to drive me back to the monastery the day before Fergus returns for us.I bit my tongue.I hoped she wouldnt think I was just taking advantage, though in a way I was, but it was for a good cause, an appropriate cause, even.Her face cleared.Of course.All my familys in Tlaxce, and I keep forgetting what its like when your kin are farther afield.Take a couple of days.Just dont miss that shuttle.No, maam, I said in relief.She glanced down at my stash of cake with a smile.And yes, I do want you to leave immediately.The half hour trip was fairly quiet.I spent the first ten minutes of it psyching myself up, then excused myself to go to a monitor at the back of the shuttle and call my sister.Just to be sure, I called her personal communicator first, not her house comm.She answered in seconds, audio only.Identify, she said, her tone offhand and slightly rushed.Of course.I was calling from a general government comm, so my ID wouldnt show up.Maria, its Grace.How are you?Howre the children?There was a slight, shocked pause, and the video flipped on.She hadnt changed too much.A little fuller around the face, maybe, but I wasnt going to tell her that.Grace?How are you!Where are you!My goodness, its not a birthday or a special occasionwhats happening?I smiled.At least she seemed happy to see me.Works happening.Ill be in Montserrat for a few days.Think I could pop by for a quick visit?Yes!Her response was breathless and wholeheartedly sincere.The children will be so happy to see you, especially Rafi, and Ioan is always complaining that you never come by.My heart lightened.It was going to be just fine.Well, then, dont tell them; let me surprise them!Is it all right if I land in the backyard inohabout three hours time?She began to giggle.Sure!Oh, this is amazing!I cant believe it.Oh!There was a voice in the background.She turned suddenly, one hand reaching out to swiftly kill the vid.Nothing, dear!Coming in a moment!She whispered hastily, audio only.Must go!See you soon!Bye!Then the link died.I sighed, smiling slightly.Blood is blood, you know?Theres too much shared history and too many cross connecting bonds to ever totally extract yourself from that half smothering, half supporting, muddled net called family.Speaking of which Dllenahkh, I said, coming back to my seat at the front of the shuttle.Im going to abandon you for a couple of days, but you have my comm ID and you can call me any time.You know that, right?He gave me a vaguely bemused look.I have the comm IDs of all the members of the mission team.However, given that I am going to a monastery, the chances of anything happening over the next two days that I should need to report are I know, I know, I interrupted with a grin.However vanishingly small a chance it might be, you can call me, okay?He paused and seemed to recollect something, then graciously said, Thank you.And you may call me as well, should you wish to do so.I was warmed by his awkward little dip into small talk for the sake of courtesy.When we landed, a part of me almost expected the Sadiri priest to come flying out, grab Dllenahkh by the head, look deeply into his eyes, and exclaim, My God, get this man to a meditation chamber, stat!Cant you see his rudimentary telepathic integument is about to disintegrate?Or not.But the image almost made me giggle, which would have been unfortunate.Of course, it was all very sedate and proper.I was intrigued that the Sadiri monks didnt seem very distinct from the Benedictines.Their garb was different, but there was no separate building, no invisible bisecting line that said Here be Sadiri.The Cygnian guestmaster and his Sadiri counterpart showed us where Dllenahkh would be quartered, took us to the refectory for a little refreshment, and then saw Fergus and me to the door, where we bade Dllenahkh farewell.The flight to the homestead took less than ten minutes.I asked Fergus to set me down a little way from the main house so that the noise of the engines wouldnt alert them.Fittingly enough, that meant I had the chance to run into one of my most favorite people in the world, my thirteen year old nephew Rafi.He was coming from the direction of the orchard, carrying a bucket of starfruit.At first he squinted at me in a very puzzled way, then recognition transformed his face into a wide eyed, open mouthed shout of happiness as he dropped the bucket and ran toward me.His exuberant warmth blew out uncontrolled like a hot gust of savanna wind, singeing me with a burning yet benign energy that matched his rough boy hug.Rafi has always been a beautiful boy, with his mothers amber brown skin, his fathers wavy brown and blond streaked hair, and big brown eyes from both parents.Hes also my godson, and I adore him.Hed write me long letters filled with sketches and stories and send them by post that took at least a week to arrive.Id always write back immediately, usually sending a small memory disk with games and other entertainment that I knew hed enjoy.I doubted his parents were aware how often we corresponded.He had begged me not to tell them, and I indulged him, secretly glad to be the favorite aunt.I dreamed that wed go traveling together when he was older and I was retired and properly eccentric.Wed ride elephants in the savanna, or join the crew of a sailing ship, or something.It felt silly to say it, so I never did, but I always felt like Id never want any children of my own as long as I had Rafi.You havent come to see me in ages, he complained, tugging me by the hand to the main house.Well, Im here now.I laughed.Boy, go get that fruit.You cant leave the bucket lying in the road so.He gave a grimace and went to quickly gather up the scattered fruit.I snagged one from the bucket as he came back.There had been mangoes under the starfruit, and I hadnt had a proper Montserrat mango in years.It was warm and fragrant when I held it to my cheek.Ahh, I sighed.If you came to visit me more often, you could have as many of those as you liked, Rafi said pointedly.I smiled at him, pleased at his clean, honest indignation, mock persuasion, and adolescent sarcasm.I love you too, boy.Maybe I should move to Tlaxce, he hinted as we walked on to the house.Maybe you should, I said, even more pleased.As if Maria would let her golden boy out of sight, but at least he had thought about it.Maria came onto the veranda wearing a blue cotton dress, looking very matronly and homely with little Gracie clinging to her side, still sucking a thumb.She looked older than me, older in a way that only two children and homestead living can accomplish, but happy, both happy to see me and happy in general.I hugged her hard and tousled Gracies hair affectionately.She looked a bit too shy to hug just yet.She didnt really know me.Oh, Grace, Maria sighed as she smiled at me and ushered me inside.Only two days?Im lucky its even that much, I said, letting Rafi take my small bag.The living room was full of memories, all stuff my mother had handed over when she gave up the homestead after Papas death and retired to a condo on Tlaxce Lake.Look whos here, Ioan!Maria called out.He came into the room, dusty and sweat streaked from working outside.
