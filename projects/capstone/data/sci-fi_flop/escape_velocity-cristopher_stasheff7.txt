The Organic Will Grow, in spite of the defoliators!Sam nodded.Dar and I got the job of carrying his resignation back to Terra.But the new ex governors lefthand man didnt like the whole idea, so he set out to sabotage us.How?The AYM scowled.What could he do?Well, first off, he seems to have wrangled himself in as the pilot of the courier ship that brought us hereand he sicced a bunch of pirates on us as soon as we broke out of H space.A low mutter of anger ran around the crowd.Oh, it was okaywe got out of it, all right, and got picked up by a patrol cruiser.But when we got here, we found out hed told the Haskerville government that one of us was a telepath and was a threat to social order.You?a voice hooted.Youre the witches theyre hunting?Whatve they got against telepaths, anyway?the AYM grumbled.Theyre not hurting anybody.Especially when they arent really telepaths, Sam agreed.But the House of Houses got wind of it, too, and tried to script us.So were on the run two ways, and running out of hideouts.A chorus of protest filled the room, and a dozen Humes thrust forward with offers of sympathy.Sons o sobakas, the AYM growled.Just let one person try do do something decent, and they throw every roller they can in your way!Come on!Well hide you!And the whole crowd swirled them out with a chorus of agreement.Dar started to dig in his heels in alarm, then noticed Sam whirling by with a delighted grin.He relaxed, and let himself be borne by the current.It deposited them in the street outside, with only the AYM and a few other Humes.Come on!the AYM declared, and he set off down the street.Dar had to hurry to catch up.Lucky bumping into you, Sam was saying as he came up with them.Not all that much luck.Thiss the ideal place for usthey leave us alone.Dar could see why.The townsfolk would want to stay as far away as they could from the drab Humes and their shoestring existence.Of course, the shortage of radio communication and police might have had something to do with it, tooif the system was rigged to stay out of the way of the taxpayers pleasures, it wouldnt be able to bother anyone else much, either.The AYM led them into an old building that looked as though it had been an office collection in its youth, but had been converted to dwelling purposes.The liftshaft still operated, and took them up to the third level.Got to exploring one day.The AYM ran his fingers over the bas reliefs that decorated the wall at the end of the corridor.I was doing a rubbing here, and I must have pressed just hard enough on the right thing, because   Something clicked; a hum sprang up; then, slowly, a portion of the wall retracted, to leave a doorway about two meters high.Dar stared.Then, slowly, he nodded.A very interesting suite.Yeah, isnt it?The AYM grinned.I dont know what kind of business the office had in the old days, but they mustve had some kind of a security problem.Import export trade, at a guess.Dar stooped through the doorway.Dont suppose it comes equipped with little luxuries like light.Try the wall plate.It hadnt occurred to Dar that there might be one.He slid his hand over the wall until he felt the smoother rectangle.It responded to his skin temperature by glowing a small, dim plate in the ceiling into life.Sam stepped through, too.You knew we were coming?No, but I had a notion I might need it someday.The AYM pointed to a few boxes of sealed packets and demijohns against the lefthand wall.Made a deposit every time I could scrounge a little extra.Theres a weeks supply in here, at least.Pretty plainbiscuit and fruit, and some meat, and nothing to drink but waterbut itll keep you alive.He pointed to a neat stack of blankets just beyond the two straight chairs.Thats all I could scrounge for sleeping and sitting.But all I promised was a hideout.The way we are right now, this is a palace.Sam clasped his hand.No way I can thank you, really, grozh.No need.Who knows?You may be doing the same for me someday.He squeezed her arm.Enjoy what you can.Ill check in every now and then.He stepped back through the doorway, and the wall segment rolled back into place.Of course, Dar observed, you realize we cant get out now.Lesser of two evils.Sam settled herself on one of the hard chairs.We can get him to tell us when the next ship lands, and duck out to the port.A month in this crackerbox?This one, or one like it, maintained by the authorities.Sam shrugged.Your choice.Personally, Ill take this one.No contest, Dar sighed, flopping down onto the other chair.I didnt know your tribe was so widespread.Therere a lot of usan awful lot.Oh, there always have been some, at least as far back as the late nineteenth centurybut theyre always a minority, unless somethings going wrong in the government.When a political system has engine trouble, alternative cultures spread.Until the engine starts running again?Sam nodded.But the numbers have been on the increase, steadily, for more than a hundred years now.I always seem to come in on the end of things, Dar sighed.And the beginning.Sams face lit with a rare, dazzling smile.Thats what comes after the end, you know.The monster in his dream was knocking on his head with a very loud, hollow sound.Dar waded up out of the morass of slumber to check on the objectivity of the knocking.Sure enough, it was objectivebut in the drab reality of their roomlet, it sounded only as a tapping, not a booming pounding.Dar frowned.Why would the AYM tap?He knew how to open the door!Therefore, the tapper didnt know how.Therefore, it wasnt the AYM.Dar reached out and squeezed Sams ankle.Her head came up slowly, eyes squinting painfully.What ?Sh.Dar laid a finger across her lips, then pointed toward the wall/door.She turned toward the tapping, irritated.He could virtually see her brain waking up as her eyes widened and her mind traced the same path of logic his had.Double crossed?Dar whispered.Cant be!Sam scrambled to her feet.I just wont believe it!The door/wall began to hum.Uh oh.Dar tried to get between Sam and the entryway.He found the right leaf.The door rolled back to show a segment of a man.It was sort of the center stripe of a personality.Dar could see the mans face, and a little of his shoulders to either side (he had no neck), a slice of chest and belly, one knee and the other thigh, and the middle of the front of an armchair.The rest of both the man and the armchair went on to either side of the doorway and, from the look of him, went on for quite a distance.If the average Falstavian was fat, he was enormous.His face was a beachball with four chins and a blob of nose over a thin lipped, tight mouth.But the eyes, tiny as currants in a vat of dough, were sharp and alive, quick with intelligence, chill with shrewdness.His chest and belly had been cast in one piece and, if there was a ribcage beneath, it was sunk full fathom five.His legs were sections of whale, and his foot was the whaleboat.The chair floated a good eighteen inches off the flooranti gravity, no doubt; and the connection sparked in Dars mind: the man couldnt get out of the chair.He couldnt move without it.That fat.Greetings, Gargantua said.I am Myles Croft.Uha pleasure.I suppose.Dar was willing to take a chance on it; after all, the man couldnt get in.Let me guessyoure the landlord, and its the first of the month.Closer than you intended.The mouth didnt smile, but the eyes twinkled.I have the honor to be mayor of Haskerville.Dar levered his jaw back in place and swallowed.Were doing better than I thought, Sam said behind him.The Humesre getting chummy with the mayor.Not particularly.The irony in Crofts voice had to be humor.No one needed to tell me where you were hidden.Once Id heard that youd escaped from the House of Houses, it was obvious youd be somewhere back in Haskervilleand, since I knew the lady of the party was a Hume, it was logical to conclude youd seek refuge in this quarter.Sam nodded.All right, so far as it goesbut howd you know about the two of us?Hold on, cancel that!Of course.If the police knew, youd know.But howd you know wed been taken to Sard, let alone that wed escaped?I have my sources.Interesting, interesting.Dar nodded slowly.But howd you know which building to look in?If anyone had hidden you, it would logically be Anthony Marne, whos as much of a leader as the Humes have.Angry young man type?I thought youd met.Therefore, youd probably be hidden in his buildingso I surveyed the establishment floor by floor, until I realized one hall was noticeably shorter than the others.Beyond that, I believe you heard my search for the activating control.Dar just stared.Then he gave his head a quick shake.Did you ever consider taking up detective work?Frequently, young manand I frequently do.The mayor should know something about the goings on in his own city.But if you know all that, the House shouldnt be able to get away with anything, and ninety percent of your citizens ought to be in jail.The huge face smiled into waves of fat.You are observant, young man.I leave it to your imagination to determine why all are still at large.Suffice it to say that I have some rather elaborate plans, which are working rather well in practice; but they result in a delicate balance, which could very easily be upset by a new and random factor.Dars spine turned into an icicle.You mean us.Croft nodded.It is in my interest to see that youre removed from my planet as quickly as possible.Shouldnt you have brought along a little protection on this jaunt?Sam asked grimly.I think not.Ive discussed you with a friend of mine, and he seems to have high regard for you.Well, its nice to have a good reference.Dar was wary.Whos our yea sayer?A Mr.Tambourin; he styles himself Whitey the Wino.And, too, I think, all things considered, that the best way to remove you from circulation is to assist you in your progress.You mean youll get us out of here?Dar pounced on it.I had that in mind, yes.Youve certainly done nothing meriting permanent incarceration; but the longer youre here, the more disruptive youll be.And I dont relish having two police forces on my planet.Two?Now it was Sam who pounced.Whered the second one come from?A gentleman named Canis Destinus, I believe.He came to me yesterday morning, bearing a letter To Whom It May Concern, from the Secretary for Internal Security for the I. D. E. , requesting the reader to aid Mr.Destinus in any way possible.But the Secretary, as you may know, is head of the reactionary LORDS party   I didnt, Sam said, but Im glad to.Mr.Destinus seems to be more than he appears, Dar said softly.Really?I thought his appearance quite indicative; looks somewhat like a rat.I take it you dont quite approve of the LORDS?Not germane.Croft dismissed the point with a wave of his hand.Fortunately, in such circumstances, the letter of the law requires a planetary official, such as myself, to make certain lengthy verifications of the applicants bona fides, including the Secretarys signature; so I explained to Mr.Destinus that I would probably be able to accord him my full cooperation early next week.As I said.Dar grinned.You dont approve of the LORDS.Be that as it may; Mr.Destinus did not seem disposed to wait.So I assumed, when I began to receive reports of pairs of police officers who were definitely not among those I had employed, that Mr.Destinus had induced my cooperation by his own initiative, possibly with Sards assistance.He hired some bullyboys from the House to impersonate cops, Dar translated.But I can see your problem; the longer were around, the longer youve got a second, but illegal, police force.Of course, I have ways of making such an enterprise prohibitively expensive for Mr.Sardbut not while the LORDS bottomless purse is open to him.However if you depart.Mr.Destinus will leave in pursuit of you.Makes excellent sense, Dar agreed, from your point of view.And from yours, I should think.As far as it goes, Sam said cautiously.Problem is, when we do leave, were a little picky about where were going.Young Hume, where you go is entirely your own affair.Nice theory, Dar approved.Unfortunately, once youre on a freighter, its kind of hard to persuade it to change its destination.Come to that, Sam chimed in, there arent any ships of any kind scheduled to lift off for a month.Howre you getting us out of here?Croft sighed.Haskerville is the only town of any size on the planet; weve something near ninety percent of the population here.Accordingly, Im de facto planetary governor, as well as mayor.So Ive authority over all I. D. E.  equipment here; and part of that inventory is a small fleet of outmoded I. D. E.  scout ships.Ive arranged for Mr.Tambourin to buy one, as government surplus.To buy a spacer?Dars eyes fairly bulged.All by himself?Government surplus is ridiculously inexpensive, Croft noted.Even soa spacer!How much money does this guy have?Not much, after this little purchase.Sam smiled up at the mayor.Can we hitch a ride, Mr.Croft?Hey, hold on!Dar caught her arm.What do you mean, hitch a ride?We cant trust this man!Sam turned back, frowning up at him.Why not?Why not?Dar spluttered.I mean  look!Were on the run!Hes the law!Thats right, hes the law.So if he says to let us go, theyll let us go.But  but   Look, Sam said, with forced patience, Im a good judge of character.Have you ever known me to be wrong about who I could trust, and who I couldnt?Dar started to answer, then hesitated.Including you, Sam reminded.Dar sighed and capitulated.All right.You win.He looked toward Croft.When does the next bus leave?With a load like Croft in it, Dar wouldntve thought the armchair could support any more.But it had lift to spare; they glided through the deserted streets of Haskerville perched on the arms like a couple of children come to recite their Christmas lists to Santa.After a little while, Dar said, It occurs to me that what youve got here is a planetful of grifters and marks, about evenly divided.Croft nodded agreeably.An oversimplification, but accurate within its limits.In fact, you could almost say its got the potential for becoming a balanced society.The potential, perhaps, Croft agreed.How do you manage to keep the House of Houses from totally destroying the citizens?Croft smiled, amused.Come now, young man!You give me too much credit.Even a criminal realizes that he must take care of his geese if he wants them to grow more feathers for plucking.Not from what Ive read, Dar said slowly.Historically, even the organized criminals havent cared who they hurt or killed, as long as they made a profit on it.Ah, but that is when they have an unlimited supply of geese!Somehow, I dont think the House of Houses has quite that much foresight.Croft nodded, amused.I may have arranged for the odd idea to reach the House through circuitous routes.Then, too, even with a severely limited police force, there are ways of making certain activities unprofitable.Dar nodded, bemused.So youve got two societies that pretty much balance each otherand its got the potential for becoming a single, cohesive society.That would take a lot of guidance and maneuveringbut it is possible.Croft nodded.Of course.Anything is possibleeven that; with an exterior challenge and thrown back on their own resources, both halves of the population might forgo their own forms of decadence.A challenge such as being cut off from the rest of the human inhabited universe?Croft nodded, a slight smile on his thin lips.You evince a definite talent, young fellow.Given time and practice, you might prove as capable of deduction as I am.The spaceport was guarded by a split log fence, like an old time Western fort.But the gate opened at Crofts approach, and they floated through, to stare at a square mile of plastrete, pock marked with blast pits.The two story personnel and passenger building seemed like a miniscule bump on the fence.The only other break in the bald field was a silvery manta ray shape tilted upward toward the stars, as though it strained to be free of the planetan FTL scout, streamlined and planed for atmospheric capability.No ferry this time, but a ship that could go from surface to surface, though without the speed of the great liners.It was beautiful, but it seemed pathetically small and frail against the immense stretch of plastrete.The hatch was open, and a silhouette appeared against its rectangle of yellow light as they drifted up.As good as your word!You found em!Whitey jumped down to pump Crofts arm.You doubted me, Whitey?Not for a second!Trouble was, it was turning into hours.A black robe blocked the hatch, and light gleamed off a bald pate.Welcome, wanderers!Father Marco waved.Come on in and tell us about your travels!We should have time; were going seventy five light years!But Dars eyes snapped to the figure beside the priest.Even as a silhouette, she looked wonderful.Good to see you again, Father.Sam hopped down off Crofts chair and strode toward the hatch.But, whyre you coming along?Its our misfortune, and none of your own.Someone has to look after your souls, the friar joked.At least, Dar hoped he was joking.Nice of you to care, Fatherbut why should you?He jumped up into the ship, carefully brushing against Lona in the process.Because, said the priest, Im a brother of the Order of St.Vidicon, and you two present a case that an engineer cant resist.Dar didnt follow the logic, but it didnt matter; Lona was giving him the long stare.He couldnt tell whether it was admiring or accusing, but he didnt really careso long as he had her attention.Well, thats it!Whitey hopped aboard and sealed the hatch behind him.Always helps to have friends in the right places.Sure does, Dar agreed, and Im awfully glad weve got you.But why?This isnt your quarrel, Whitey.It is now.Whitey flopped down into the nearest acceleration couch and stretched his webbing across.Things were getting dull, but you two promise to make them interesting again.But youre heading for the frontier, and we have to get to Terra!So do wenow.Whitey grinned.As long as you promise to shake the old place up a bit.Besides, I have to see my publisherIve suddenly run low on funds.Dar swallowed, feeling guilty, but Whitey looked around and bawled, Whos going to pilot this tub?Who else?Lona jumped into the pilots couch with relish.Id fly a mountain to get back to some good old fashioned decadence!She hit a few keys, and the spacer roared to life.Ill take communications.Sam slipped into the couch beside Lona and keyed the talker.Whats the name of this tub?I christen it Ray of Hope, Whitey declared.Ray of Hope to Control, Sam called, outward bound toward Sol.Uh  come in, Ray of Hope.Control was, to say the least, startled.Permission to lift off.Permission to ?Uhbe right with you, Ray of Hope.Dar could hear a squawk in the background before Control killed its mike.Looks like we took them by surprise, he said to Whitey.Not surprising enough.Whitey frowned.Whos gotten to them?Three guesseswhich is two more than you need.Sam keyed her mike again.Ray of Hope to Falstaff Control.Whats the delay?Uh  Ray of Hope, Control stammered, it seems you forgot to file a ballistic plan.Ballistic plan?Whitey bawled.What does he think this isa hop to the next planet?Ray of Hope to Control, Sam said grimly.I thought ballistic plans went out when FTL came in.Wellwe have to make sure you dont interfere with any incoming traffic.Incoming traffic!What incoming traffic?The skys as clear as a verdict!Whitey chuckled.As owner of this ship, pilot, I order you to lift off.Yes, Grandpa, Lona murmured, entirely too demurely.Then there wasnt much talking, because they were plastered back in their couches for a few minutes as the Ray streaked up through the atmosphere.Then the pressure eased off, and down gradually stopped being the back of the ship and became the deck, as ships gravity took over from acceleration.Coasting at nine tenths maximum.Lona spun her chair around and loosened her webbing.Id advise you stay in your couches, though; should only be about twenty minutes till were far enough out to isomorph into H space.We barely made it, Sam said with a sour smile.Remember that squawk in the background?That was Destinus.Destinus?Father Marco sat up, frowning.Canis Destinus?Why, yes, now that you mention it.Sam turned to Father Marco.You know him?More than that; were related.The priest seemed suddenly saddened.Hes my fathers half brothers son.Dar frowned.Wait a minutethat makes him   Half a cousin of the brother.Whitey turned to the friar.The two of you were on the same planet, and he didnt bother to say hello?Father Marco nodded.And it would seem that he probably knew I was here.But then, under the circumstances, I suppose he wouldntve wanted to be associated with me.Doesnt sound like the overly sentimental sort.To say the least, Father Marco replied grimly.In fact, I havent heard from him since I went into seminary; he was very upset with my choice of order.Thought I was horribly radical, that sort of thing.He turned to Sam.Hes been causing you trouble for a while?Hunting us down, Sam confirmed.He seems to be working for the LORDS.Father Marco sighed and shook his head.Poor Destinus!We knew he was keeping bad company, being in the government and allbut I didnt know it was this bad  well!He slapped his knees and sat up straight.Looks as though I made the right decision, coming along with you.How so?Dar frowned.Finding out about your half cousin makes that much of a difference?Father Marco nodded.Family obligation.Its up to me to try to counter the damage Destinuss trying to do to you.Well, dont be too hard on the boy.Dar frowned up at Sam.I mean, its not as if he were doing it on his own.Hes just acting for his bosses.Theyre the ones whore going in for telepath hunting.Oh, I wouldnt be too sure of that.Sams lip curled slightly.Do you think hardheaded politicians would really believe in telepaths?I mean, believe in em enough to mount a major hunt?Why else would they bring in their own police?Because, Sam grinned, it makes an excellent excuse to immobilize you and me, before we can get Bhelabhers resignation to BOA.Could a governorship of a boondocks planet be all that important?To the governors righthand man it could.Besides, even if the LORDS are planning to cut off all the outlying planets, that doesnt mean they like the idea of governors whore ready to get along without them very nicely, thank you.A point, Dar admitted.That is a little deflating to the collective Terran ego.Which makes me think Myles Croft cant be all that popular with BOA, either.He always was an independent cuss, My was.Whitey grinned, leaning back with his hands locked behind his head.Myself, I think its just fine, seeing the outer worlds getting ready for Terra to ax em  Ready?Eager, almost.Lona was watching her data board.About to isomorph, gentlefolktighten your webbing.She frowned, and peered closer at her detectors.Strangethat blips gotta be another ship lifting off from Falstaff.Strange indeed.Dar frowned, too.There werent supposed to be any arrivals or departures for a month.You dont think ?Sam began, but then the isomorpher kicked in, and reality turned very fuzzy for a while.9  Out near the asteroid belt, on the Jupiter side, the solar systems tapestry of gravity begins to thin out just enough for a ship to emerge from H space.Its not the safest thing to do, of course; there is a respectable chance of Jupiters gravity fouling the isomorpher enough to make the ship twist into that other realm where ships that nearly made it back out go to.Still, probability favors success; so, if youre in a hurry, you might try it.Dar and Sam were in a hurry, so Lona tried it.Deceleration slammed Dar against his webbing.It was killing pressure, but it slowly eased offvery slowly; it took the ships internal field a while to win over momentum.When he could sit back and talk again, he did.II take it we made it?Were in one piece.Lona sounded offended as she scanned her damage readout.Not even a split seam.Didnt mean to question your ability, Dar said quickly.Its justwell, it was a little risky.Lona snorted.Not for my niece.Whitey leaned forward and tapped the autobar for Rhysling.The only kind of machine Lona doesnt understand is a hammerit doesnt have any moving parts, let alone circuits.Anyone join me?Red light exploded off the walls and ceiling.Lonas hands flew over her board.That was a cannon bolt!Chug that drink and hold on!Something groaned, winding up to a scream as ships gravity fought to keep up with velocity changes.But it was a losing battle; Lona was putting the little ship through so many rolls and dives, a four dimensional computer couldntve kept up with her.Which, of course, was exactly the idea.But their pursuers battle comp was good; ruby flashes kept flickering off the walls, now brighter, now dimmer, now brighter again.How about the traditional shot across the bows?Dar called.Theyre not big on tradition, Lona snapped, sweat beading her brow.I never did have much use for iconoclasts, Father Marco grumbled.Its a Patrol cruiser!Sam stared at the rear viewscreen in horror.The Solar Patrolthe ones who rescue stranded spacemen from starship wrecks!And shoot down smugglers, Whitey added grimly.But they never shoot without warning!Youve been watching too many Patrol epic holos, Grandpa, Lona grated.These are the real ones!Are they?Sam keyed the transmitter.Lets find out!Ray of Hope calling Patrol cruiser!Come in, Patrol cruiser!An energy bolt lanced past them as Lona rolled the ship to starboard.Come in, Patrol cruiser!Whyre you shooting at us?We havent broken any laws!And were not carrying contraband!Sam let up on the key and listened, but there wasnt even a whisper of static.Maybe its broken, Dar said quickly, not picking up their answer!Dreamer, Lona growled.Ill try anything.Sam spun the sweep knob, and a voice rattled out of the tiny speaker  at the top of the roster.Its on his new holocube, Roll Me to Rigel!Commercial channel, Sam grated.A new voice interrupted the announcer in mid word.Ganagram News Updatebrought to you by Chao Yus Chandlers, with the latest in used burro boat fittings!Must be the Ganymede 3DT station, Whitey said, nodding.They broadcast for the asteroid miners, mostly.How can you tell?Who else uses burro boats?We interrupt this program to bring you a special hot flash, the radio went on.Weve just been notified that a small pirate ship with a notorious telepath aboard has just entered the Solar System.Citizens are advised not to worry, thoughthe mind readers being chased by a Solar Patrol cruiser.They should be calling any minute to tell us hes been captured and locked up.Theyre talking about us, Dar choked.Correction, Lona snapped.Theyre talking about you.They did say, he,  Whitey admitted.Also, that theyre going to capture uswhich sounds like a fine idea, right now.Sam keyed the transmitter again.Ray of Hope to Solar Patrol cruiser!We surrender!We give up!We throw down our arms!Red light blazed through the cabin, and the whole hull chimed like a singing bell.That was really close!Lona rolled the ship over so fast that Dars stomach lost track of his abdomen.Theyve got a weird idea of capturing!I think, Whitey mused, that theyre out to avoid the expense of a trial.So, what do we do?Dar demanded.We cant keep running forever.So far, the only reason were still alive is their lousy marksmanship, and Lonas fantastic piloting.Flattery will get you an early grave, Lona snapped.I need ideas, not compliments!Well, hows this?Dar frowned.We came in between Jupiter and Mars, heading sunward.Whats our speed?Were back up to point nine seven light speed.Father Marcos eyes lost focus.Lets see, that means  its been about five minutes for us, so for the people on Earth   Its been a few weeks, Lona finished for him, and if we dont do something soon, were going to get punctured by a small swarm of teeny tiny asteroids, and flattened when we run into a few big ones!Asteroids!Sam sat up straight, her eyes locking on Dars.We did it once   And Ill bet the Solar Patrol arent much smarter than pirates!Dar turned to Lona.Can you match velocity with an asteroid?Of course!Lona crowed.Kill our power, and all we are is a new asteroid with a high albedo!Not even that, if you can get a big rock between us and the sun.Can we slow down that fast?Can do.Lona nodded.Itll take most of our power, though, and it wont be very comfortable.She had a nice knack for understatement; it was hell.Not as bad as it couldve beenat least she had the courtesy to turn the ship around so she could decelerate with the main engine, and they were plastered back into their seats instead of being slammed against their webbingbut they were rammed so far into their couches that Dar couldve sworn he felt the hard plastic of the frame, and held his breath, waiting for the couch to either snap or spring a leak.But it held, and he began to wonder if he would.His nose felt as though it were trying to flow around both sides of his face to join his ears; his eyes tried bravely to follow their optic nerves to their sources; and after a while, it occurred to him that the reason he was holding his breath was simply that he couldnt breathe.It was about three anvils, a barrel of horseshoes, two blacksmiths, and a Percheron sitting on his chest  Then the pressure eased off, and swung him against the side of the hull as Lona turned.The acceleration couch slowly regurgitated him, and he found himself staring around at a cabin that perversely persisted in looking just the way it had before they passed through the hamburger press.Then Lona flicked a finger at her console, and the lights went out.All he could think of was that she was over there, and he was over here, still webbed in.It was such a horrible waste of a great situation.Into the sudden darkness her voice murmured, Ive killed all power, so they wont have any energy emissions to track us by.Dont let it worry you; you can still see out the ports.And we wont lose heat too fast; the hulls well insulated.But the air recyclers off, and this isnt all that large a cabin for five people.So do the best you can not to breathe too much.Breathe lightlysleep if you can.And dont talkthats a waste of air.If the powers off, your detectorsre out, Father Marco murmured.Right.We wont know where they are, except by sight.Which doesnt do too much good, of coursethey could be far enough away to only show as a speck of light, but they could still get here in a matter of minutes.So, how will we know when to turn the lights back on?Whitey asked.When the air starts getting foul, Lona answered.When you start feeling short of breath, and drowsy.But they might still be nearby then, Dar objected.Life is filled with these little chances, Lona murmured.But lets make it as long a wait as we can.No more talking.Sibilant silence descended on the cabin, filled with the rasp and wheeze of people in various states of health trying to control their breathing.After a few minutes, someone began to snore softlyWhitey, no doubt; Dar could only admire his composure.For himself, he was watching nervously out the nearest porthole, and, sure enough, there was the tiny dot of light, swelling rapidly, turning into a Patrol cruiser which shot by overhead so close that Dar had to fight the urge to duck.One pass, Lona murmured.Gadget lovers, Father Marco chuckled.They dont trust their eyes anymore; if it isnt on a sensor screen, it doesnt exist.Then, pretend we dont, Sam hissed.Shut up!The patrol cruiser slid out from the top of the vast asteroid that hid the Ray of Hope.Dar held his breath; if there were a single eye actually watching out a porthole, all hed ever know about it would be a huge red flash that just might burn out his life before it melted his eyes.But, come to think of it, he didnt even see any portholes, and the big ship drifted on past them and disappeared into a cluster of space junk.Sam heaved a sigh of relief, but Lona hissed, Belay that!What?Sam protested.Breathing?You were hoping, Lona accused.Whats wrong with that?Sam demanded, but Father Marco assured her, Its too soon.And right he was, because here came the space shark again, drifting up so closely above them that Dar halfway expected it to ask if he was interested in life insurance.But there must have been enough nickel iron in their friendly asteroidal neighborhood to hide the Ray of Hopes mettle, because the cruiser lifted its nose and rose above them, more and more quickly until it disappeared into the clutter of floating rock overhead.A multiple sigh filled the cabin, and Whitey croaked, Huh?Whasa matter?They find us?Huh?What?I think they went up above the plane of the ecliptic, Grandpa, Lona assured him.Hoping to get a better view of the situationlooking down at us, Dar suggested.Can I hope now?Sam squeaked.A huge bass chime shook the cabin, and Lona hit the power key.Only if we get out of here, she answered Sam.That was our first visiting neighbor; hinting we should move out of the neighborhood.A little asteroid, colliding with us, Dar explained as the lights came on and gravity sucked him back down into his seat.Its a wonder its only the first one; they couldve knocked us to bits by now.Not really, Lona said, punching buttons.We came in above the plane of the ecliptic, matched velocities with this asteroid, and swooped in right next to it.Most of the local pebbles are in orbit around it.That little stone that just hit us shot in from a close bypass with another big rock.It was just a matter of time before it came calling though.But it wont happen again if were going back above the plane of the ecliptic?Are you kidding?Lona snorted.That Patrol boats up there!Were going below, sister, so well have the whole depth of the asteroid belt between us and them, to foul their sensors!Brace yourselves, everyonethis is going to be a rough ride!Nos morituri te salutamus, Father Marco intoned.We who are about to die, salute thee  Dar shivered.You couldve thought of a cheerier blessing, Father.You speak Latin?Father Marco cried in surprise.What are youa fossil?NoI just got stoned at Chollys a lot.Then Dars stomach rose as the ship sank and a huge gong reverberated through the hull.Nothing to worry about.Lonas voice was tight with strain.It cant really hurt us unless its as big as my head, and I can swerve around anything that sizeI think.Then Whitey was pointing upward out the porthole and shoutingbut the gist of his comment was lost in another huge BONG!as red lightning lit the cabin and the ship bucked like a metal bull.Over the fading chime, Dar could hear Lona cursing as she fought to stabilize the craft.The red glow fadedand left them in darkness broken only by the shards of reflected sunlight from the dancing asteroids around them.Sam shouted in panic, and everybody started talking at once.BELAY IT!Lona shouted, and a sudden, eerie silence fell.Dar drew in a long, trembling breath.Whatever had happened, it was really bad!They were waiting for us, Lona said into the hush.As soon as we fired up, their sensors locked their battle computer on us and let loose a ball of pure energyseveral, really; the first few just vaporized the junk between us and them.The last one knocked off our tail section.As it is, were luckyif I hadnt swerved to avoid a rock, theyd have caught us right in this cabin.Theyre rising again.Whitey had his head craned back against the viewport, staring upward.Sure.Lona shrugged.They didnt just shear away our enginesthey blew away our reactor, too.Theres no power left for them to sense.Besides, why should they bother hunting down the pieces?They know were dead now, anyway.Sam strangled a sob.Take heart, Father Marco said sternly.We arent dead.We do have emergency power, Lona agreed.Itll keep recycling air while it lastsand the suns radiationll keep us warm, if we block the portholes on the far side.And we have a couple of weeks rations.Will the power last that long?Sams voice was hollow.Lona was silent.It will, if we dont talk much and can do without light, Whitey answered.Of course, we cant go anywhere.Father Marco grunted in surprise.I didnt know you knew any physics.I was an engineer before I was a bard.Dar could hear Whiteys grin.Who else could make enough sense out of this civilization to set it to music?But Im a gambler, too.Dar felt the dread coalescing into terror.Just what kind of gamble did you have in mind?Father Marcos voice echoed with foreboding.Well, we cant go to help, Whitey mused, so weve got to make it come to us.Dar cleared his throat, which pushed the fear back down.Youre talking about a distress signal.Itd give us a little chance, at least, Whitey answered.Without it, were deadunless you can arrange a miracle, Father.Im afraid my connections dont quite run that high.The priest sounded amused.Even if St.Vidicon reaches out to us, weve got to give him a handle to grab us bysome sort of action to put us into the ring of coincidence.How much energy would it leave us?Dar dreaded the answer.If its going to be strong enough to do us any good, well have to put half our remaining power into it, Lona answered.A weeks worth.Dar wet his lips.That gives us a week for somebody to hear us and get here.They were all silent.A week!something shrieked within Dar Only a week to live!Ive never even been in love!We dont really have any choice, do we?Sam said softly.The cabin was silent again.Then Sam heaved herself upright and leaned forward to the communications panel.All right.How do you want it?Breath hissed out in a sigh of consensus.Broadband.Lona slapped keys, routing the emergency power to communications.Just the traditional Mayday, with our coordinates.Sam leaned forward to the audio pickup and thumbed the transmit key.Dont give the name of the ship, Whitey said quickly.Sam hesitated, then spoke.Mayday, Mayday!Distressed spacer at 10:32:47 V. E. , 5:22 below P. E.  Mayday, Mayday!Moribund!Moribund Death bound.Dar felt the dread wrap around him, creeping up his spine.Sam shut down her board.Leave trickle power on, Lona advised.If salvage does come, theyll need contacta second of arc is a big distance out here.Sam hesitated, and Dar could almost hear her thoughtshow much life time would they lose to that trickle?But I. C.  grains drew only a few milliwatts per hour, and a rescuer a mile away who couldnt spot them was no better than no rescuer at all.Sam nodded, cracked one slider, and left her main on.The cabin was silent again; then Lona said, Now we wait   for death.Dar completed the sentence in his head.What do we do with our minds?The silence became acutely uncomfortable.Then Father Marco stirred.I do know a little about meditation.Would anyone like a mantra?Burro boat FCC 651919 to distressed spacer.Respond, please.Dar sat bolt upright, staring at the first pair of eyes he sawLonas, fortunately.So soon?Where was he, just around the corner?Its been two hours  Even so  Burro boat, this is distressed spacer, Sam snapped into her pickup.Can you rescue?Distressed spacer, I can rescue and am in your vicinity, but need transmission to home on.Please continue transmission of carrier wave.Burro boat, will do.We await you anxiously.Sam locked down the transmit button, but covered the pickup with her hand and swiveled to face the others.It doesnt have to be the Patrol, you know.If it is, well know in a minute.Whitey gave her a dry smile.As soon as they get a locus on us, theyll blast us to vapor.Sam flinched, and whirled back to her console.No!Lona snapped.It might be legitand if its not, Id rather steam than starve, anyway!Sam hesitated, but she left the transmit button on.And it could be honest, Father Marco pointed out.The prospectors flit all over the belt in their burro boats.Why shouldnt there have been one two hours away?Lonas eyes glazed.Well, the probabilities   Spare us, Whitey said quickly.Have you been praying for St.Vidicons help, Father?Father Marco squirmed.It couldnt hurt, could it?Not at all.He mightve stacked the deck in our favor.Whitey craned his neck, staring out the porthole.Dar, take the starboard view.What do you see?Just asteroids No, one of thems getting bigger There!There was a concerted rush to the starboard portholes.Is that a ship?Dar gasped.It was dingy gray, and it mightve been a sphere once, but it was so pocked with crater dents that it looked just like any of the asteroids.Two paraboloid dishes sprouted from its top, one round for radio and microwave, the other elongated, for radar.Below them, the hull sloped down to two huge windows; the miners liked naked eye backup for their scanners.Below them, the hull kept sloping until it reached the loading bay: two huge holes, housing solenoids, for small bits of ore; below it, a mouth for big chunks.Beneath a bulbous belly hung two pairs of pincers, one fore and one aft, for grappling onto small asteroids that were two big for loading.From the aft section sprouted a spray of antennae that set up a force field to prevent rear end collisions by small asteroids.Its beautiful, Sam breathed.The burro boat rotated, broadside on to the Ray of Hope, and a small hatch opened in its side.A magnetic grapple shot out, trailing a line.It clanged onto their hull.Distressed spacer, said the com console, We are prepared for boarding.Sam dived for the console.Acknowledge, burro boat.Well just slide into our pressure suits, and be right over.Whitey swung out a section of the wall.I hope they left the suits when they mothballed this thing There they are!All five crowded around, feasting their eyes on their means of escape.Air?Sam said doubtfully.Dar snorted.So hold your breath.Its only a hundred yards!He hauled down a suit and handed it to Sam.Ladies first.Male chauvinist!You go first!All right, all right, Dar grumbled, clambering into the stiff fabric.Check my seals, will you?Y know, something bothers me.You too, huh?Whitey was sealing him in with a crisp, practiced touch.You wouldnt be wondering why we havent heard from the pilot?Well, yes, now that you mention it.Or is it the custom here, to let the computers do the talking?Definitely not, Lona assured him, sealing Sam into her suit.Of course, there might not be a pilot.Could bebut not likely, Whitey grunted.Didnt you hear the serial number?This is one of those new FCC brainsFaithful Cybernetic Companions, programmed for extreme loyalty.Theyre not supposed to want to do anything without their owners express command.I thought those were robot brains.Father Marco frowned.Whats it doing conning a ship?Whitey shrugged.Cant say, Father.I do know that every scrap of junk and every used Terran part finds its way to the asteroid belt sooner or later, to get the last erg of usage out of it There!He slapped Dar on the shoulder; it sent him spinning in the free fall of the powerless ship.Go out and conquer, young fella!I thought I was going to be rescued, Dar grumbled.And why do I have to go alone?Because a burro boats lock is only big enough for one at a time.Whitey all but kicked him into the Ray of Hopes airlock.Have a good tripand try not to breathe!The door slammed behind him, and the other hatch was opening; and if he didnt go out there and try to swim through vacuum to the burro boat, hed be killing his four friends, who couldnt go into the airlock till hed gone.He gulped down his panic and forced himself to step through.He held onto the line with one hand, groping frantically at his waist for the suits anchoring cables.There!It was a snap hook with a swivel.He pulled it out; a strong line unreeled from somewhere inside his suit.He snapped the hook onto the line.Catching the overhead line, he pulled himself back against the Ray of Hopes side, bracing his feet and backing down into a crouch.Then he fixed his gaze on the burro boats airlock, took a deep breath, andjumped as hard as he could.He went shooting out along the line like a housewifes dry laundry in the first drops of rain.For a moment, he was tempted to try going faster by pulling himself hand over hand along the line; then he remembered that he was in vacuum, which meant no friction, but his gauntlets on the line would mean friction, and would probably slow him down as much as they speeded him up.So he hung on, arms outstretched in a swan diveand began to enjoy it.Then the burro boats side shot up at him, and he grabbed frantically for the line, remembering that he might have lost weight, but he hadnt lost masswhich meant inertia.If he didnt brake, fast, the next friend down the line would have to scrape a nice, thin layer of Mandra off the burro boat before he could get into the airlock.The scream of improvised brakes squealed all through his suit, while the burro boats side kept rushing up at him, seeming to come faster and faster.Frantically, he doubled up, getting his feet and flexed knees between him and it  Then he hit, with a jar that he swore knocked his teeth back into the gums.But, as he slowly straightened, he realized his joints were still working, and the stars that didnt fade from his vision were really asteroids sweeping past.Somehow, hed made itand all in one piece!He breathed a brief, silent prayer of thanks and stepped gingerly through the hatch.When he was sure both of his feet were pressing down on solid metal, he let go of the line with one hand to grasp the rim of the hatchway; then he let go with the other, and pulled himself down into the nice, safe darkness of the interior.His elbow bumped a lever; irritated, he pushed it awayand the hatch swung shut behind him.Darkness.Total.Complete.That was when Dar learned what claustrophobia meant.
