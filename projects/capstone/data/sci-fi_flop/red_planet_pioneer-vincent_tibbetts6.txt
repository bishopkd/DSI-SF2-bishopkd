There wasnt one person who made it all the way out here that didnt realize after a short period of time, this was their home.Xavier was one of the few people who still carried out an Earth type edict for how they should colonization this place.His policies were rooted in the financial investments of those grubby old men.For that reason alone he felt he had driven more stakes into the ground than anyone else on this barren red rock, and they owed him for his efforts.They should have acknowledged how steadfast he was in implementing their plan.Instead the corporation went out of its way to drive a stake of their own squarely into his heart.NO REAL KEYS Philman Devinch walked into the office, startling Xavier, and snapping him out of his carceral thoughts.As Philman sat down, Xavier felt there was the smallest of windows to say something to Harvard before he quietly departed, but somehow he knew his assistant was already gone.He wished he had the power to ignore him like Philman was currently able to do, but then again, Xavier found they all usually ignored Harvard, and why not?Anyone cultivating a reasonably sound mind should have.It is done!I have sent the finalized report to the Singo Chinese.They will have plenty of data to go through over the next few months, or should I say before we start hearing back from them.I asked you to send them an air tight report.How can it be air tight, if those would be your concerns?Well, I would liken it to a submarine, those things are air tight yet they operate under plenty of concern and believe it or not they do have to surface on occasion.Xavier noted there were days where he swore the things inside of his head were tightening, like a boa constrictor would tighten around its prey, only this feeling wasnt wrapping itself around his mind, it was constricting his thoughts.He almost wanted to cry out from the sharp, burning pain.It lasted only a moment, causing him to have flashing type visions, projections of himself.Those frightful frames had him falling down an elevator shaft, or loosing his grip on the ledge of a skyscraper, or falling with the debris of a mid air collision frantically grabbing the air looking for something to hold onto.He wondered if the others with implants were being plagued by such visions.He found himself staring at Philman, and chose to break the uncomfortable silence.What about the female Dextoid, the Data Support Engineer, did you have her destroyed?No.There was something about the way she was reacting during the interrogation.I cant explain it, perhaps it was just the way she kept resisting.I felt I needed to break her will.I still feel that way even now.I have to follow through on this to prove my point to her, to all Dextoids really.It is our duty and is why I decided to keep her.Do you think this wise?I mean having an attachment to a Dextoid, especially this Dextoid?Xavier checked himself.There were plenty of people who grew attached to their Dextoids.The reasons they chose the particular model of Dextoid were little psychological profiles that spoke volumes about their own lives.Xavier didnt want to go down that path, at least not today.He broke it off and went on another tangent.We cannot have her resurfacing into the general population for any reason.That would blow the lid off this thing, and I mean in a big way.There wont be any problems with her.I took the time to modify her to the point where she wont be able to leave this facility.Im holding her as an insurance policy against what the Singo Chinese might say after analyzing my report.It all depends on where they want to take the investigation, we might need her, or parts from her that are still working, maybe even parts that look as if they have been blown to bits.For the record, I dont like it.I have one or two things I still have to work out, but the answer to your question is yes.I can promise you things will be alright.Xavier threw his pen on his desk as he leaned back in his chair.This is such a crazy place.I dont know if we will ever see a normality here within our lifetime.I dont know that we should.I mean why would we want that!We couldnt operate with the freedom we do now if this place were normal.That type of world would most certainly reject us.Lets be honest, both worlds have a sense of entitlement running through them.Having a society like Earth laboring through a free for all rarely means we are at the beginning of anything, it usually denotes an end.Xavier wanted to say more, but he just couldnt bring himself to do it.He knew the axe was falling on humanity and a lot of people were going to get hurt.Why couldnt people understand it was never going to be one gigantic event that would end it all for them as a species.Tens of thousands of little cuts could kill a person just as easily as one large gash.The general population could never wrap their heads around that concept.The axe slowly destroying them wasnt sharp, it wasnt even taking big swipes at them, it was coming down again and again in a brutally slow shredding fashion.Desperation is a horrible deodorant.Everyone can sense it, even the creatures living in the animal kingdom know this stench.Having these Dextoids walking amongst us is a vile proof of where we stand as a race; things are not in the healthiest of states if we keep needing to invent creatures like this.We are on the brink, there is no getting around that, and I am reminded of it everyday by the presence of these things.I hate the Dextoids.Strong words, especially from someone who is in charge of security.Really?Because I feel like I am just doing my job.I am frightened of our future, and to be honest you should be too.I think we are setting ourselves up for one big fall.People are fallible, yet they walk around as if they own the world.Its complete arrogance.I dont think as a race we have the toughness to accomplish things in the long haul.We have failed to show any signs of it to this point in our existence.You sound like a man trying to request some time off, maybe a little rest is in order.Its got to be difficult working along side all those corporate criminal investigators, they are practically becoming their own department.Xavier said it half heartedly, it was meant to be a joke, but Philman failed to see the humor in it.Its not like that.Its hard to explain, but I saw something in the public consciousness when I was still on Earth that didnt sit well with me.People back there are genuinely concerned about the challenges they are facing, but no one could do anything about it.Much like a whale that has beached itself, the large crowds are helpless in moving it.What are you talking about, people are cleaning up as much as they possibly can.They have even begun to launch tons of their garbage toward the sun.Theyre using that burning orb as a gigantic incinerator!That is exactly what I am talking about, all of those things are happening, but people themselves arent actually doing anything to make it happen.I dont understand, people on Earth seem to be very proactive in trying to right the ship down there.You want them to actually go out and do the work?Its hard to explain, but in a way, yes.I look around at all the activity happening up here on Mars.People go out and explore, turn bolts with wrenches, and extend a helping hand wherever its needed.On Earth, people seem all too relaxed in sending the Dextoids out to do their bidding.People seem to think it is their solemn job to take shelter from the shit storm swirling all around them.Those denizens are closing down more and more to their immediate surroundings.It goes against every grain of evolutionary thought.So we arent going to survive as a species because we arent turning the bolts on things back on Earth?Excuse the pun, but thats rubbish.They have to clean things up so they can go out and function in those areas.There is no getting around that fact, it is a plain and simple truth.I dont think so, people have gotten to this point as a species because of their physical involvement with life, and that energy is beginning to wane on Earth.They need to be more proactive in doing the physical things if they are going to make it.Xavier sat up a little straighter and folded his arms, he felt some fatherly advice on the subject were in order.Look, there are plenty of theories on why people made it as a species.They talk about things like their low energy consumption for survival.If an animal has to burn a lot of fuel to be able to survive, then all that animal is going to do is eat all day.No, you need to know starvation; you need to become aware of your survival instincts.You need to be able to work in groups and communicate your ideas with those around you.Thats what people did, thats what they are doing now.It doesnt have anything to do with sentience.Hell, there is even a theory out there that states the other animals may have left us alone because we just plain smelled bad.Now, can you imagine that?We stunk so bad the other creatures left us alone.Now that might really be the only reason we made it as a species.Sure I believe we stink alright, only we are smelling up the joint in a different way.By allowing Dextoids to take a lead role on some of these issues is just plain wrong.Its a power point that will eventually be used against us.Look at the military usage of Dextoids, we actually accept the fact military grade Dextoids can kill people.Arent we currently living their exact fear of a rogue Strike Dextoid?That is what Alec is, isnt he?The only thing saving us is Alec isnt running with a battalion of his kind destroying everything in sight.If Alec were on Earth right now they would have hit the panic button months ago!First of all, Dextoids are basically designed to run solo, programmers have gone out of their way to retard their ability to run in packs.They usually venture out on their own...And that has never been my problem with those things.People can plan, plot, and program all they want with Dextoids.They arent going to get around the fact those things are starting to take over in certain areas of our lives.Dextoids arent the ones running around in a pack, as a race, we are.Creatures that run in packs arent always doing it out of support for each other.A creature like a gazelle runs in a pack, but they arent doing it because they figured out running in numbers shows some type of unity or strength, they are running in packs to out do each other.They are hoping to out jump and out run the gazelle next to them so the lion, or whatever else is watching them, will focus on the weakest of those gazelles.The lone creature that has fallen out of the pack because it is weak, is the one sacrificed by the herd.People dont want to hear that, but it is the ruthless game gazelles are really playing.This is the same game people are playing with each other right now.Its a vicious cycle of trying to out do each other, constantly vying for a higher ground.The weaker people, the ones who are falling out of the pack, are being sacrificed.They arent helping each other like they used too.Just makes the pack stronger, you said it yourself.Yes, in the example of the gazelles, but not so for humanity.People are falling out of the pack in droves.These callous actions are actually making us weaker.We are showing our vulnerability as a species at the wrong time.You act as if people are dying, and they arent.They just arent proactive in society, they arent participating to your level of satisfaction.Youre generalizing...Im generalizing!Im not the one talking about gazelles!Okay, sure I am simplifying things.I realize they are more complicated than my example, but it is about participation.With all of the everyday tasks we have given the Dextoids, its as if we are passing the sentient torch off to them.I dont like it at all.What would you have us do?Get rid of them?Destroy them?No one would buy that, but we can make them a little less, I dont know, interactive with people.We need to show them their place.We need to make sure they know they are here to serve us, that they were created to be our slaves.They need to know they are beholden!Philman had worked himself up into a bit of a frenzy.All Xavier wanted to do was talk him down.Having him in this state was counterproductive to their mission.I think some of the feelings you harbor for Dextoid sentience is perceived.Sure Dextoids show signs of it, but how much of it is programmed into them by us.I mean it wasnt that long ago people actually thought horses could count.It was just a nifty little trick a trainer could teach them, those animals never really knew they were counting.A horse has a certain curiosity, they are social creatures, they want to interact with people.That is how animals become domesticated, its the same thing with a Dextoid.Really?The same thing?Horses can be found in the wild, and you are right they can become domesticated, we break their will and we train them.Horses can be used in assisting a person with their job or in a recreational ride, but never, not even once during a stampede, would I worry about the fact that those horses would rise up and somehow usurp our position in life.Now can you say the same thing about a Dextoid?If they started running in a pack, if they were to stampede, I dont know, sometimes thoughts like that keep me up at night.Now that really is rubbish.Dextoids are randomly being brought in for checkups all the time.They are examined, re examined, and torn apart on a continual basis.No one has ever reported anything unusual.There are no anomalies that would even get them to believe anyone is in danger.There are so many things Dextoids are forbidden to do because of governments wanting to protect their citizens.You arent the only person who feels this way; there are countries that are coming up with rules to keep these creatures in check.I think we can safely say there are enough people voicing your concerns over this for it to never be a problem.Sure, wait a couple of generations from now.Ill tell you they wont look at it in the same way we do.You and I wont be around to see it!To care about it beyond your longevity is the point.That is part of humanitys duty.If we had taken that approach from the very start back on Earth we wouldnt be in our current situation!That is what I would like to see with Dextoid production, us doing everything we can to avert a mess we create in the future.Look at all the contradictions as they stand now.Dextoids cant assemble other Dextoids or activate themselves in a factory, but they are allowed to repair each other out in the field.They arent allowed to run in packs, yet they work together on things like toxic cleanup projects.Most importantly, Dextoids cannot kill a human beingthat is the law!Yet they have created Strike Dextoids to do just that.We have contradictions my friend, and exceptions to the very rules we said we would never break.You dont find that in the least bit disturbing?These things are far from being an ersatz!They are cunning, insidious, shrewd, animatronic devices looking for a way in.What happens when they realize they cannot save the planet?What if it gets to the point in their efforts down on Earth that they realize it is a lost cause?Whatever happens they know right now they themselves will probably be able to survive it.Failure is failure, whos to say they wouldnt help the process along, say like fail to do something that may have saved human lives.How would anyone know?I mean would a Dextoid faced with this reality really go out of their way to save the last man on Earth?Xavier rubbed the top of his head lightly with one of his hands.Interesting hypothesis, before I rebut some of your statements, I need to know your definition for sentience?An entity able to project in thought, forward into the future as well as look back into the past, a species which can have an individual level, as well as a collective level of consciousness, and be able to express all of these things through either reading, writing, or a language.Fair enough.The development of Dextoid sentience has become a subject for people to banter over, I am always amazed at the various definitions people employ.Sentience somehow always allows for the inclusion of mankind and the exclusion of every other thing around it.Im fine with their prejudices.I have to point it out though, I guess that type of exclusiveness amuses me.Well, sentience is an exclusive club.That it is.I think you would have to admit these are dangerous times in general for mankind, without the hypothetical onslaught of a Dextoid takeover.Which leads me to my next question, did the company send you in here today?Come again?You know what I mean, are these questions part of my psychological profiling?Is this some sort of confidence test?Xavier stared blankly at Philman, awaiting for his response.It was an awkward moment, but Philman tried to remain calm.He wasnt exactly sure what Xavier was asking of him.The conversation had suddenly been turned on its head.Philman was tired in so many ways.He was still feeling the affects of being at the outpost for so long on his assignment with I Glo.There was plenty of time for him to get lost in thought when he was over there.His thoughts had transformed into opinions and ideas, which were beginning to drive him.He was essentially looking for a sounding board, a confidant.It was a policy touted by the corporation that those in management positions could never complain to the employees beneath them.They could complain to someone laterally, but preferred if the mid level manager complained to his superior.There were very few people Philman could turn and talk too when he considered this policy.He was hoping Xavier would be a person he could confide in.He took another hard look at all the piles of paper on that desk and the disheveled look Xavier wore, something wasnt quite right about what was going on in this office.Philman couldnt put a finger on it, but the only thing that kept creeping into his conscious mind was that of Cabin Fever.Those words however, had an antiquated feeling to what was really happening in here.Ah.He cleared his throat.He needed just a little more time to process exactly what Xavier had asked him.Yes.I guess I will have to admit I am not that good at it.I ah, I had to do my part you know.There was a certain amount of satisfaction that registered on the face of Xavier.It was as if he had just figured out a difficult problem and received confirmation for being able to deduce it correctly.Its understood, they want to make us all feel as if we are participating.Strange how they do it, you know, send the questions to you.Its a little unsettling for someone who isnt familiar with the process.Feels more like an ambush on their part, probably an intervention on yours.Ah, yes.It is rather uncomfortable in that way.In all the years Philman had been on Mars, he had never heard of a confidence test, and he was the Chief of Security now.It didnt necessarily mean this process didnt exist.The company had gone around his back on issues like this before.Still though, it seemed strange to have a network of employees asking questions of each other.Surely the corporation could validate confidence in other ways.He felt himself becoming angry.His security clearance had to stand for something!Why did the company feel it necessary to immerse itself with all these sorted layers of secrecy?How could he do his job effectively if he wasnt privy to corporate policy?So is that it then?Are we through?I mean the whole point of the test is to solicit answers to your questions that reflect a state of mind, unbeknownst of course to the person being questioned.I think we can both agree the process has been compromised.Yes, it undoubtedly has been.I would say we are done.Philman started to get up out of his chair; half heartedly mumbling his next comment under the heavy exhale of his breath.I have to get back to my work.As he turned his back Philman began to feel himself out of touch with the workings of this place.The tangent they just went down left him with nagging concerns.He knew now he would never be able to voice his opinion within the confines of this office ever again.As Xavier had so eloquently pointed out, the confidence had been broken.This included anything they could have had as friends.Working in security always had him being suspicious, always looking for the next person to pull a fast one over on the company.Thats just how it was.So Philman always ended up studying how people were reacting to their situations.Protecting corporate secrets was becoming a dirty business.He watched for habits and routines, studied micro expressions from the digital library of interviews they had recorded.He developed techniques for finding how well an individual told the truth during questioning.All those things confirmed for him that people could identify with people.This was the one thing they had over the Dextoids no matter how sophisticated they created them; human behavior was best understood by a human being.He often wondered if these things were to outlast mankind, what an alien race would deduce about humanity if they came into contact with something like a Dextoid?If they had a chance to take one apart, would they even see the hand humanity had in their existence?If they did would they see people were a species who liked to tinker, create, or that they even had the capability to dream?Would they see all of this within the inner workings of a Dextoid, perhaps, but more likely, perhaps not.The reality was if aliens did deduce humanity existed from dissecting a Dextoid, they would probably see that human beings never came to grips with how frail they really were as a species.Perhaps they would even think them vain for creating Dextoids in their likeness.Philman wondered of all the stigma people had fought through over the centuries, why they couldnt see the danger of the Dextoids.It was right there in front of them.The advent of technology made people truly blind.It was the only answer.These thoughts made him sick to his stomach.Didnt they understand it was his job to watch Dextoids all the time, he knew from his experiences they were evil.The look those things gave him sometimes, it was in their eyes even if it was only for a second!His fear had bubbled over with a pure hatred for them.If he could have confirmed the fact they would have suffered from it, he would have given each and every last one of them a beating with the lash.08 Qi Earth had to have been a madhouse the day those apelike creatures took to walking and talking.How they must have tested their fortitude against the relentless onslaught of nature.They laid their hands into the dirt and mud of their world to carve out a place within the safety of its niches, and when they were embolden enough they went on to construct large edifices as the means to celebrate their greatness.Human beings had found a power within this kind of symbolism.Under the right circumstances there were structures that would evoke a feeling or create a lasting impression, transcending themselves right into the iconic.The Hanging Gardens of Babylon, the Coliseum, or the Great Pyramids of Giza, all eclipsed the necessity of their era to exert such a feeling.They became something larger than themselves, burrowing their way into the lexicon of nations to become the prime examples of mythology and morality.As humans emerged from their dark age, they developed a strong curiosity for examining their past.In doing so they began to realize it wasnt just the structures that stood tall against these millennia, but all the things that survived the test of time regardless of their condition.They looked reverently at the single pillar standing amid the collapsed temple, or the decapitated statue left amidst the rubble strewn across the landscape.Alec noted how human beings took the time in trying to preserve these artifacts in their exact state, as if to capture a three dimensional snapshot of the moment.They dedicated the grounds they found these ruins on as a part of their national treasures, or brought the pieces to a place like a museum to encapsulate that energy.People revered these things because they began to understand what an elusive thief time really was, the brazen swindler, a larcenist, the slickest of burglars, an embezzler who openly stole, a kleptomaniac that knew he would never be caught.Time was a fat robber baron who had seated himself comfortably on a large plush throne.He had a jovial air about him, and was openly obese with confidence.He took on all comers because he knew there wasnt a race he would ever lose or a thing he could not outlast.It seemed odd to Alec that a sucker bet would always bring out the sucker, it was strange how that seemed to work.Yet there were people willing to stand in line with an almost frothing cupidity, fighting for a chance to place a bet on that severely skewed table.Humankind was constantly betting against the line, and somehow surviving the test of time.Alec stood there looking dead on into the distance at a few of their wagers, three of their rockets standing out against the Martian horizon.From their blocky rugged look, those rockets appeared to be of the older Ares models, first generation stuff, probably of the North American variety.They stood tall, awaiting the colonization effort to be pushed in their direction.Often planners landed craft outside their construction zones for just such a purpose.It took far less effort in getting materials and supplies to the people who really needed them during this initial phase of assembly.These rockets acted as markers for those crews, they were the stakes in the ground telling everyone where they should gather.From the looks of it though, these three rockets may have been the exception.Perhaps they were viewed more along the lines of being used as a means of escape.There was always the chance they were a logistical mistake.The reality for Alec was it didnt matter how these spacecraft got here, or what purpose they intended to serve, they were here.They stood their ground as if they were stoic centurions, the protectors to the entrance of a new hope.Alec wondered if a more primitive people were to somehow stumble upon them, would they recognize the message these rockets were trying to tell?Could a primitive person examine a rocket and see all the dreams behind its construction, or would they only see it as well polished, unclaimed scrap.He couldnt help but observe how everything in this human based society seemed to be advancing, moving forward in some way, shape, or form.They had made strides in the medical field, with computers, in communication, microbiology, industry, design, and construction.The two things they seemed to be stuck in were the two things they relied on the most for getting from one place to the other, the automobile and the rocket.Alec stood there, an advancement in robotics, representing leaps and bounds on scientific platforms covering everything from autonomous vehicles, biology, and nanotechnologies.For him to even be looking at one of these spacecraft would be the same as if a person were able to look at a living breathing dinosaur.There were no excuses for it; neither of them should have ever been able to see the other.Looking behind him as he came off the hill he was on, he acknowledged the footprints he was leaving.He was taking chances now, chances he would never normally take.Since his escape he had always tried to be more stealth like in his movements, concealing his presence the best way he knew how.He used rockier surfaces, the system of caverns, and even walked some of their rails.Leaving footprints was unacceptable in his world.They trailed off behind him telling them where he had come from, and in turn where he was heading.This may have been a foregone conclusion though, in the end they would only have to step back and guess at which biosphere he might be heading.Humans were the ones trapped within those structures.Dextoids were the ones out in the field experiencing all of the remote areas of this world.The colonists were focused more on merging with the technology they had developed for their own sheer survival, rather than trying to mesh with the aura of this planet.The people of Mars were becoming introverted in the face of its expanse.The dry arid plains forced a different vocabulary out of them; they seemed to lack words in their vernacular like lush or succulent.That was because there was nothing on Mars ever needing to be painted with the brush of those adjectives.Those fruitful expressions vanished from their daily usage, to become filed away in the archives of their minds.If there were any reasons for him to ever want to go to Earth, it would be to experience the character of that planet.From what he heard of its past, there were plenty of things they could have described with the usage of those words.He wondered what a place like the Black Forest really looked like during its heyday.It had to have been breath taking, thick and green, grand in its stature.The mythos spawned from the ancient people who had experience it made him appreciate how special it must have been.In their minds this forest was a foreboding place where wood nymphs, wicked witches, and wretched trolls were apt to lurk.He felt it wasnt especially important for humanity to have these types of tales to survive up here on Mars, but the lack of them did reflect how detached the colonists were from the bedrock of this place.CASTING A GAZE He slowly allowed the rockets to come back into focus.They stood there silently waiting for him.For whatever the reason, he needed to make his way to those rockets if he were going to have a chance at rescuing I Glo.Everything he was about to do, all the answers he would ever need in solving this predicament were lying in wait inside those salient silhouettes.To launch a rocket required a heavy visual infrastructure.There was a lot of prep time and a lot of personnel.Approaching those ships he kneweverything about them said they werent even close to being ready to do something like that.Yet none of that rational mattered.He could not shake the ill at ease feelings he was having of those things abruptly igniting just before he got to them.He saw the rockets roaring off into the air leaving a trail of billowing black smoke and fire far behind them.There was nothing out there to support his fear of being engulfed in this explosive nightmare.Still he could not help but approach with caution.Making his way toward them, he could not help but notice the fair amount of garbage and litter strewn about the site.Nothing disturbed him more than their attitude toward waste.As he had crossed this planet he saw how they left it everywhere they went, there were derelict support vehicles, boxes, containers, detached hoses, stripped cables, and debris from things that dropped out of the sky or exploded during reentry.All of this garbage appeared to be overlooked with an attitude of being someone elses job to clean up later.They treated this world as if it were somehow meant to sustain their refuse.These people, these human beings, why couldnt they see they were no better than the waste they could not maintain.Their attitude in this area was cause for concern and he shuttered to think how he might find I Glo.They demonstrated such a cavalier attitude toward the things they didnt care about.They could have deactivated her as soon as they got into the shuttle or disposed of her as soon as they landed.Those things were plausible, but not possible.They had to have brought her all the way out here for a reason.The facility up ahead was isolated.It was as if they were announcing to anyone paying attention they did not want to be disturbed.The real question gnawing at his being was what condition he would find her in.He was getting close, close enough now to see the detail of those ships.Even for a first generation rocket, there was a sleekness to them that spoke volumes about the energy it took to get here.He got to the ladder of one and without too much trouble began his ascent.He had to acknowledge it was always a little longer climb in getting to the top of one of these vehicles.If he felt this way with all his capabilities, how were the people under duress and having to make this climb taking it?He was willing to bet it was only then they had an appreciation for what it took to get here.Alec got to the top of the ladder and opened the door, beyond it lay a wealth of supplies that included boxes of food, enough water to keep ones palette wet, specialized tools and pressurized tanks, and what he was really looking for, space suits.He shut the door behind him.From the way everything was organized and still neatly packed, he deduced he was the first one to take advantage of what this supply ship had to offer.He began to rifle through the pressurized suits hanging in their compartments until he found one that looked to be about his size.He then began to dig around in the stacks of boxes, drawers, and cubbyholes, looking for the undergarments that would go along with his suit.He grabbed the gloves, boots, helmet, and tank from which to breath.He spent time making sure he had all the components needed to complete his ensemble.Once done he began the tough task of putting it all on, it was as close as he ever felt to physically wrestling with himself.Once on and sealed tight, he secured the last lock on his breathing system and then activated the suit.It began to pressurize, filling quickly as if it were a balloon, and at one point Alec wondered if the suit had the good common sense to automatically stop, or if it would keep filling to the point where it popped.The system worked and the suit equalized.He stood up inside the capsule, allowed for his arms to hang by his side, and spread his stance a little wider than normal.He got into an active pose just so he could feel the inability to move his arms past a certain point or take his full stride.The entire get up was limiting his full range of motion.His vision was slightly obstructed by the bulbous helmet he had on his head.If he needed to see something to his extreme right, he would have to turn his head and whole body in that direction.He wasnt going to fool anyone with where he would be casting his gaze.For the brighter days there was a sun shield that could be deployed by simply looking at a button within the helmet.It was more than obvious the shading was there to help cut down on the glare, but Alec felt this feature had another purpose, and one that was more beneficial with what he was trying to accomplish.The sun shield allowed him to conceal his face.All they would get in return when they tried to peer into the helmet was a distorted reflection of themselves and the world around them.As he stood there within the capsule trying to get used to the suit, he could not help but think how this thin feeling vellum was all that separated a person from the extreme harshness of the Martian environment.How frail, he thought.How frail these people were in needing a space suit like this just to walk the planets surface.If he were to go on all the things he had seen in the short time he had been around.All of this so called empirical evidence of their technological mastery of this world, then he had formed an opinion alright.This mountain of evidence was proof they were well in over their heads.They had a planetary pretentiousness about them that bordered on absurdity.In trying to convert this planet to fit their human needs, there wasnt a day gone by where he didnt feel the tremors from their efforts.Any world would shake though as they tried to activate the geothermal processes deep within its core.The idea of them doing this represented both genius and recklessness.It also brought to bear the complete desperation humanity was under in trying to make it work up here.They were playing billiards on an oversized pool table, and they were hoping to pocket every last shot.If they scratched just once in this frenzied game, they had the possibility of annihilating everything they had worked for.Great Ganymede!As a species these people had spent a majority of their generations in caves!Now they were trying to move things in both heaven and Earth to save themselves.He knew they were tossing everything they had at their disposal toward this endemic problem, the tantivy of their rockets, the grunt work of the Dextoids, and the movement of celestial bodies through the astral sidereal.The populations of both these worlds were helplessly trapped watching it all go down.He became angry with himself.This was exactly how he had gotten into this mess.He was standing around doing nothing but wasting time!What if she were still in that facility tied to a chair.She would only have one thought, that of wanting to be saved, and how was he going about honoring that?He was standing here with this superfluous piece of clothing hanging off his person.This was his ticket into that insidious outpost.He would gain insight on occasion, an insight that quivered with inexactness, but at the same time conveyed to him a story.He assumed it was a bead of information from within the quantum world.He could see the facility up ahead, if only for a moment.The thick green grass needed mowing and the trees planted out in front were filled with leaves sprawling upward toward the sky.The building looked to be of a new design.Was he seeing something from the future of Mars, or was it a replica of what they had built back on Earth?He wasnt sure how this all worked, like a ship revealing itself from a heavy mist, it was suddenly there.Sometimes though, it felt, at least to him, the ship wasnt always friendly.Alec was aware there were things out there moving in that mist trying to retrieve information from him.CUMBERSOME The outpost he was going to try and gain entry into was the first structure the corporation had built to house its own astronauts.As they began to crest the numbers they could safely board there, they moved their efforts northward, to what would be their main biosphere, and the jewel of the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.The rocket he was currently in may have represented the indecision they felt on where to divert those resources during that move.He had it on record how this first facility transitioned over time into what could best be described as a safe house.There was always the potential something would go horribly wrong with the main biosphere and they would need to fall back to this place.There were things corporations worked on that they never wanted the general public to see.This outpost began to suit their needs for hiding such things.Those projects, even if they were just on paper, were locked securely away behind closed doors.Those plans delved in the frailty of the more esoteric or exotic, or the wiry suspicions of a sublime extreme.Whatever their machinations, these things always seemed to seethe with the rapid spasms of life, they swam within the pipettes of the pandemic, plotted in the most diabolical ways to limit a persons freedom, or took the form of a chair in order to torture a Dextoid.What lay ahead in that facility might very well tear at the fabric of his being, but he was left with very few choices in the matter.With that thought, he suddenly could not shake the feeling he was being set up.Was it possible they were using I Glo to lure him in?Was he not acting like the hungry rabbit out on a lush green lawn, only seeing the carrot and ignoring the wooden box hinged precariously over it?Did he not see the trap they were setting?Was he turning a blind eye to all those warnings, just like that hungry hare?If his line of thought was correct, then it was the corporate brain trust wanting him as far away as possible from their assets before they made an attempt in subduing him.Their precious estates would be safe and none of their industrious personnel would get hurt from his brawny rampage.There, deep inside him, flashed a feeling of searing heat, if left unchecked, it could have easily brought his blood to a boil.His upper lip curled back at its side with the thought of walking into a situation where they might try to overpower him.The creature needing a suit like the one he was wearing would never be able to tackle him.He felt strong, stronger than any of them ever could be.His chest puffed out with defiance.Go ahead and let them try.His strength wasnt something he had tested personally per se.There wasnt a day back at the lab where he was made to stand defiantly in the middle of a room bare knuckling all comers to the vociferous glee and applause of his makers.He felt his strength to be serrated, with purpose, precisely impactful.It gave him the feeling he could mix it up with any individual roaming this world.His thoughts went well past the singular combatant.He was becoming aware of his potential to take on the mob.It didnt seem completely plausible, there had to be a zenith, a numerical plateau to the number of combatants he could fight all at once.His feelings for this spat in the face of their logic.The strength he possessed was the gritty mortar of who he was, and it would be their provocations giving him a glimpse into what he could become.He felt a need to reach down and find a handful of mud and apply this type of terrene to his face.He needed to show them how grounded he was in his thoughts, the oneness he was beginning to feel for this world and it was because of them.The energy was like that of hot slag being poured out of its cauldron, it splattered the confines of what should have been his heart, pitting those walls and leaving them scarred.He was a warrior.What better way to celebrate this than to go out there and face his enemies?He opened the door to the capsule and looked out onto the distant horizon.There were no oceans on Mars, yet as he looked at all those small gently sloping grades spread so evenly to the horizon, he could imagine them becoming the slow rolling waves of an immense caramelized sea.He understood what he was witnessing; this illusion was called a mirage.To break this visual spell he would need to go the distance.He made his way down the rungs of the long ladder and headed off toward the direction of the outpost.As he marched along Alec realized his space suit carried with it an unwelcome affect.He was able to hear the crunching of the dirt beneath his feet through his suit!It was as if the sound were somehow amplified, traveling up his body and to the acoustical chamber that was his helmet.He didnt particularly like it.The sound was weird, and easily drowned out any other noise from the outside world.This was information lost!To any logical being this loss was completely unacceptable.The bulbous helmet actually took this one step further with its phonics, forcing him to hear his own breathing!This technology seemed so contradicting, aiding and hindering all at the same time.For him the person wearing this suit became somewhat less of a person.As he marched on he did things to test this garment, pushing buttons on the panels, and triggering functions with his eyes along his heads up display.He wanted to see how those applications worked and responded to his commands.A lot of their gadgets seemed to be there either for the wearers comfort or aiding in their communication.If he were a human being those things would have come in handy, his Dextoid sensibilities didnt find it so.Although he did like the feature allowing him to tint or tone his face shield, bathing his world in and out of indigo.He had only walked several miles, but for him it might as well been several hundred.He didnt think it possible but the suit got more cumbersome as he traveled in it.If they made straight jackets for Dextoids, they would have based their initial designs on this suit.It was that uncomfortable.As he approached the top of another ridge, his instincts took over, telling him to get down on all fours and crawl until he came to its crest.At that point he found himself lying down on his belly, positioning himself to peer over the small shelf of rocks, his bulbous helmet taking the lead.Off in the distance lay the outpost; it looked to be more like a clumping together of cylinders and containers.Some of those were partially buried as the structure ran under a higher sloping side, confirming for him the facility continued off underground.There was a mishmash of gear littering the rooftops, those things looked to have long since lost their usefulness.These gadgets sadly hung off the entire structure, things like small dishes, antennas, arrays, and other gimcrack technologies cluttering those areas and decrying in the face of all their scientific know how.As he laid there staring at the structure, it hit him, he was looking at their approach in trying to adapt to their environment.Here was a template for their adaptation.There was nothing smooth or polished about it, but then again they werent trying to be.Humans expanded more along the lines of a cancerous lesion looking for anyway to get in and be fed.As long as they were able to attach themselves and be shown those comforts they kept growing in that direction.The only way to get rid of something like this was to cut it out completely.Every time that happened, every time a civilization vanished, a culture died, the surrounding environment always moved in to do everything it could to bury it.Did it ever really occur to anyone the surrounding environment was constantly trying to rebound in this fashion?Why would it need to do this unless nature itself was being cut into and unreasonably encroached upon?All the environment looked to do was equalize with its surroundings.There were plenty of examples of extremes dominating a planet like Earth, but in each and every instance those situations never lasted the test of time.The planet always rebounded to what it wanted to bethere was no water world, no snowball Earth, and no room for the over population of people.Earth was under extreme duress and all of their efforts were coming down to the wire.He imagined it like a knife flying through the air, slowly rotating toward a balloon pinned helplessly to a wall.It did not matter how they were selling it to the people back on that planet, the real reason most of them were leaving was the fact they too saw in their minds the knife, only it was coming for them.Out there before him was the ugly truth.The amount of steam and smoke that came bilging out of the outpost gave meaning to a thing like run off energy.This same pollution might be a way one could tell whether or not an intelligent species had taken over a distant world.The ugly carbon footprint left behind from such an industrious effort was unmistakable, and every person that had ever gotten a hold of recent pictures of the Earth was a witness to how far things had gone.In this vane pollution should have been one of the bullet points under which sentience was defined.SENTIENCE: 3.(of an unbalanced cohabitation) The capability of an intelligent creature to produce, as a by product, harmful waste from its industrious efforts.The ratio of clean air to pollution should be skewed as such that the surrounding natural environment is unable to filter or maintain a healthy balance, and that readings of said pollutants can be confirmed deep into their water table and high into their atmosphere.As part of their sentient capabilities they should be able to acknowledge this pollution through repeated study and testing.It can further be argued that the deliberate release of these pollutants is the result of greed.The contaminants found in their environment can be shown to be extremely harmful to the inhabitants.It should also be noted as individuals they will not be able to solve any of these problems by themselves.As a member of any organization set out to protect the organic resources of their world, such naturalists or conservationists will be confronted by skepticism from the uneducated and encounter bureaucratic red tape meant to diffuse the impact of their movement.They will also battle competing rhetoric from corporate funded scientists and speakers hired specifically to challenge the data, change the scientific results, misinform the general public and dissuade the masses through the use of mainstream media channels.Combined these things should tax their energy, dilute the urgency of their efforts and drain the financial resources of the creatures trying to save their world.FALLING FOR THE RUSE Suddenly to his left and off in the distance, Alec saw the plumes of dust from a robot moving across the surface.He watched as it sped along until it suddenly came to a stop.It jerked a little, as if it were trying to gather its bearings.The tank treads the robot was mounted on swiveled in his direction and made a heavy zipper sound as it sped toward him.They were onto him!Whether it was a ground sensor, a camera mounted on the top of a pole, or a satellite tracking him, he had become a blip on somebodys radar.He activated the sun shield on his helmet to conceal his face and began going through the motions of moving and then stopping, slowly crawling, as if he were on his last leg.The robot got to Alec a little quicker than he expected, and was surprised not only by its size but by its strength.Alec did not resist as the robot picked him up, then turned and began rushing him toward the outpost.It wasnt long until they were headed for a container with its doors opened wide.As the robot wheeled them inside, those doors quickly closed behind them, and they waited there until the compartment had became pressurized.Strong miniature jets blew the dirt and dust off of them, creating a red haze.Sensing these pollutants, a number of vents were activated, sucking away the particulates until the air was clean.With the process complete, another set of doors opened and the robot hurriedly carried Alec to the other side.They waited there until the doors behind them had sealed shut and the room became pressurized.When all was calm, a man entered the room and began to look at the panel located on Alec's right arm.The readings from the device were bouncing everywhere.By the persons reactions Alec could tell the man was beginning to panic.Great!The pad must be broken, Im not getting any accurate readings on his vitals!From over the loud speaker a voice was heard responding to him.Hanns, try removing his helmet.See if he is still breathing.The robot held Alec out so Hanns could work the clasps, it was then that Alec raised a hand and grabbed the mans arm to stop him.Hes...hes still alive!Then get him to the triage room immediately!The speaker crackled as if the person responding were miles away in another building.The robot hesitated, just long enough so it could begin to protest.But sir, we should The voice on the speaker barked through the static with a spike of anger.Enough with Standard Procedures, get that man to the triage area immediately!The robot was doing its very best to hold Alec so as not to hurt him.As soon as it crossed the threshold and into the hallway leading to the triage center, Alec maneuvered himself in just a way as to suddenly slip through its arms and fall to the ground.The robot reacted by trying to stop immediately, but because of the speed in which it was carrying Alec, it couldnt adjust soon enough.The robot ended up tipping over Alec, but it did not touch him.The robot had made a valiant effort in supporting itself with both arms.Hanns, who was running ahead of them and heard the crash and turned in time to see the robot bridging himself over Alec.The man panicked.You bumbling idiot, what have you done!Sir, I assure you I had As the robot was responding, Alec kicked out one of its arms.The robot realized all of its weight was now supported by just one appendage and couldnt compute why an astronaut would kick out the supporting arm of a robot who was clearly doing everything it could not to hurt him.Alec saw the robots efforts and used the awkward opportunity to slide out from underneath him.The robot of course did not react, in large part to show Hanns he never had any intention of hurting this astronaut.Alec leapt to his feet and came down on the back of the robots head as hard as he could with a knee drop.The robot, not expecting this at all, lost its balance and immediately fell to the floor.The arm Alec had kicked out was still held high off the ground and slightly behind still in an effort to show Hanns and anyone else who might be watching he had no intention of hurting the astronaut.Alec grabbed the arm with both hands and with his knee still firmly planted in the robots back, snapped the arm off.Hanns slowly started moving away from them, his gaping jaw telegraphed the horror he was feeling for this developing situation.Alec sensed this fear and played off it.Hanns desperately wanted help; the things transpiring before him were going horribly wrong.He reached out, his hands spread wide in protest.Alec slowly got up, his shield still painted in the dark glow of indigo.He studied this ineffective act by Hanns and found it repulsive.He undid the clasps of his helmet and twisted it until he could pull it straight up and off.As Alec removed this headgear, Hanns felt a sense of relief beginning to wash over him.At least now he would be able to satisfy the primitive instincts sweltering deep inside him demanding one human being have the ability to see the face of another.Faceless people were a horrific black speckle on the minds eye.Within the dark blot of that imperfection, tales of the headless animated by anger were allowed to walk like zombies all the way down into the human subconscious, spraying its walls with a thick lentiginous coating of fear and hate.Darker hearts would feed from such a poisonous organ, dawning the hoods and masks to empower evil.Faceless were the bank robbers barking out their orders, the terrorists who recklessly threaten the world, and the executioner who allowed for his sharpened axe to pass through the neck of their prone victims.The sound of that chopping block barked back at that fallen blade, and was a sound that echoed behind some who closed the door to the staircase of their sexual desires.In those dark rooms, behind the soundproofing, they subjugated their partnersand it all started with the simple act of covering their face.While engaging in conversation, people had an inherent need to make eye contact.Hanns was feeling the needed for this more than ever right now.He needed to comfort the primitive images so clearly imprinted in the back of his mind, that of the happy monkey, the hurt monkey, or the angry monkey.Hanns needed to satiate this facial recognition, he needed to see Alecs face, so he could than act accordingly and express his friendship, his sympathy, or his fear.He spoke out of a desire to know.Yes, yes, its alright now.You can remove your helmet.Youre okay.Its safe.No one here is going to hurt you.Alec now stood before him with helmet in hand, partially resting the remainder of it against his body; it was the classical stance of an astronaut.Hanns knew right away something wasnt quite right about his appearance.Telegraphing like lanterns through the wilds of his hair, past the grime and smudge marks coating his face, was the disconcerting coarseness of his steel blue eyes.Even though Alec looked to be restricted in his space suit, those eyes were telling Hanns a different story.The individual contained within osculated with a volatile energy, as if he were an electrically charged coil humming with the hope of making contact.Of all things that could have happened in those next few moments, this was something Hanns was not going to grant him.I think you should be Hanns parted before Alec could finish his sentence.Alec felt an unusual resolve begin to molt from within as he began to shed his superfluous suit.He saw himself as the single man who had successfully stormed the castle, an en passent in the grandest of fashions upon the squares of their giant chessboard.He really felt as if this entire fortress was his to do with as he pleased.Theoretically he could run to the top of its spire, and shout out at the wicked Red World a cry that would invectively mark his domain.He could stand there in clear defiance of all those who could see him, arms held high as if he had the ability to embrace the sky.The castle was truly his!The success of this illusion put him on a high that had his mind baking a confectionery of pleasurable thoughts, and as nice and empowering as those mental pastries were, he hadnt the stomach to digest the sloppy gruel of reality they were actually beginning to prepare for him.Deep down inside he knew this panacea would be crushed with the first garrison they sent to storm this place.Those men would come with real intent, systematically kicking down the doors of every room within.The last thing he needed to be doing when they found him was to be soaking himself in a tub of warm solution, drunk with delusional thoughts of power, looking as if he were wearing the heavy crown of a king.Being pompous was a good way for him to get caught like this; it was equivalent to letting ones guard down.The only real tangible thing in this whole scenario was his need for rest.His mind craved an inner peace he had never seemed to be able to attain since his activation.He had no idea how a thing like rest was supposed to happen now with all the thoughts he had bouncing around in his head.They were like the silver balls of a pinball machine gone haywire.Those balls struck their targets and triggered the sound of long running bells.He worked the flippers frantically trying to keep all those things in play and all the while attempting to influence the outcome with little nudges and outright jolts.He had more things going on in his mind than he cared to admit.In this torrid storm of gamesmanship he needed a moment, to attain rest, less the machine that was his mind register a game ending Tilt.The robot Alec fought lay broken on the floor.He wandered away from the triage area and turned down one of their long halls.He was in a self induced hypnotic trance, boarder line frumpy, feeling like a child being sent to some far off corner on a well deserved time out.He was arriving at the end of his rope and needed to generate a new day to the whispering crepuscule of his tired being.Halls and corridors passed him by as he delved deeper into their compound, before he knew it he found himself staring at a series of uniform doors that looked to be the sleeping quarters of whatever staff they may have decided to house here.He was passive in his efforts in trying to get into each room, slowly walking down the hall and letting his arms extend out to lightly touch the doors, hoping one would acknowledging his presence and open.When one finally did, it opened with all the magic and suddenness of an Arabian tale.He froze for a moment at the granting of his wish.There was a tone to the silence he was immersing himself into, and only now did he understand the soothing architecture these halls had on his person as he slowly traversed this corridor.It got quieter and quieter as he had made his way down into this part of the structure.What lay beyond was a supreme solitude, a palatial palace for promoting peace.His inner being tingled at the prospect of what possibly lay before him, irenically launching him as if he were a skiff exploring the stillness of a placid pond.Alec drifted into this subtle little world of the sublime, sitting down on a bed that came sliding smoothly out of the wall.It was the grandest of douceurs this little room could offer for having found this chamber.They had placed a finely pixilated monitor within the wall and framed it in such a way to make it look as if it were an actual window to the outside world.The average human undoubtedly would have fallen for such a ruse, but Alec was smarter than that.He could see through this thinly framed facade.He wondered if the faint blue sunrise he was now seeing was being broadcast to him live from some other place on the planet, or was this the sleepy little picture they always televised to the person arriving to any one of these chambers.HIGH PITCHED WAILS What time of the year was it anyway?His whisper was to no one in particular, but his thought was provoking enough to take a jab at him.There had to be a reason he felt so mentally sucker punched by his own question.He worked the thought out as if it were a large, uncooperative ball of dough.He kneaded it under the heavy weight of deduction, relentlessly working it until the dough had finally conformed into the shape of an answer.Much like the weary victim of interrogation, this particular thought surrendered its secret to him.This faint response connected for him the concept of ones personal experience to those of the seasons.Now his question to no one gained strength, jetting passed him with the speed of a foehn, and filling his sails with knowledge.He couldnt quite put his finger on it, but there was something powerful about stringing together the physical present with a personal past.Its energy transcended the moment, much like the blades of a windmill that bit into the air.He felt himself all at once wanting to endlessly chase down those days gone by.Were it not thoughts just like this that carried a person from dusk to dawn?Could the radiating heat from their sun bathed body have them recalling a summer from their past?Would the slightest scent of dampness in the air have them remembering trips to their grandparents basement in retrieval of pickled goods?The spirited sounds of people gathered under a veranda, clanking their glasses amidst hearty bursts of laughter, could this cause one to travel back to their youth, of people gathered around a crackling bonfire from a nostalgic fall festival.Alec came to the somber realization he hadnt that endearing connection with time.For him the seasons had more to do with the orbital position of Mars in relationship to the sun than with any of these humanistic en gogues concepts.He had been handling the passage of time by tearing out the pages of his mental calendar, and letting them fall to the ground with all the concern a giant tree would have in shedding its parched leaves.Each branch would always lean on the others, confident they would grow more than they lost.So too it was with Alec, everyday that ended brought on the birth of another and those days seemed to be far greater in numbers than those of his past.The two directions for him would never meet.The sprouting leaves on those branches never knew of the ones that lived before.To Alec trees were a fascinating duality of biology.They were able to adapt and grow, branching out in the most far fetched ways just to exist.They embodied an archetypical stand to the Machiavellian concepts of time, and in doing so they exuded a character all their own.Here was a living, breathing thing that had no set feelings, yet people insisted on imprinting them with human emotion.Trees were lavished with the same type of attention usually reserved for celebrities.They had their portraits painted, photographed, found themselves to be the subject of poems, or had entire stories written about them.People somehow could plainly see in a tree its anguish, disease, even despair, yet when they stared into a mirror they were unable to see these same desperations contained within themselves.Why were people so acceptant of the trials and tribulations they put themselves through?Did they not understand the steady state of breaking open old scar tissue because of their insistence on repeating the same mistakes over and over again?Was change in this fashion so hard to achieve, especially if it meant getting to a healthier state of mind.Left unchecked they would become contorted in their old age, driven by the billet of their ignorance.They saw themselves as survivors of an unkind universe, claiming a fast one had been pulled on them their whole lives.Their goals and dreams had been whittled down to unwanted trimmings, a byproduct from constant self pruning.Unlike their human counterparts trees would branch out and grow regardless of the torrent storms and fire they had to endure.Could people say the same things about themselves?He wondered at times if he wasnt closer to a tree in being than he was to a person?
