However, it is much more frightful than Crilshar alone.Something else is coming, Ruben, and Titans end is near.Callista spoke the words, her prophecy.She saw it; but too late to act.Erebus was the darkness.There must be a reason you would explain this, Maxim said.Such information presented to your enemies so freely cannot be without an end.Malizar looked at her.I simply want you to understand just what power youre dealing with, and what it means for us all.Were not alone in this galaxy, Ruben muttered.No ...we are not.He rose up now, as though he was finished with all of them.I also reveal to you my thoughts and desires because you will never again meet a soul worth informing.I am sure my allies, the Retani Dynasty, will make room in Hellfire for such deserving traitors.Frightened and cold, a tear fell down Rubens cheek as he turned to look at the others in the chamber.Vasilys fists pressed into the ground as he knelt nearby, his eyes fighting back tears.He had only done what he thought was necessary to save his people.The General bore no resentment.Edgar Mokrikov knelt behind Malizar, clutching his head in the palms of his hands as though attempting to come to terms with what the Cronat had revealed, resigned to serve him forever.Ruben pitied him.Lady Maxim Pinzn, however, held her head high.I am truly sorry, she said to him.Mauldeth and I tried to find the weapon.Our efforts were futile, which is why I turned to you.I had to find it myself.I couldnt let him find it first.Malizar glared at her defiance.So when you realised it was too late you thought you would go along with my plan and come to kill me yourself?Maxim did not reply.Her faith had fallen.Hush filled the chamber.And that is it?Ruben said as he stared into the true face of darkness.Malizar gazed back, victorious, whispered, That is it.Now that your orbiting fleet is destroyed, your invading army crushed, I will leave you with the Dishan.Enjoy your last moments.Ruben breathed out deeply.It was always my intention: to surrender my life.Well now you have, Malizar said, and turned.Only, I cant let you leave either ...The cloaked man stopped, spun back harshly.And how do you plan to stop me?He shifted in agony.I planned this long before today.And now I know my familys not down here, there is nothing that will stop me from destroying Crilshar entirely.Malizar hesitated, be it slightly and only for an instant, but it was all that was needed for his alarm to lay itself bare for all to see.What?Your overconfidence has made you underestimate everyone around you.Me included.I see your desperation, General.I lie here, powerless.And yet, Im still more powerful than you.Malizar laughed; a long, cold, intoxicating laugh.I dont believe you.You dont need to believe me.Just know that while we have been down here, while youve been explaining all your cunning plans and proving just how powerful you are, my brave soldiers have been descending Crilshars cavernsone by oneuntil they completed the task that was asked of them.Until theyd prepared the explosives, ready for my command.With that, both Yux and Wivartha Dishan stepped forward, panic on their pale faces.What have you done?said Yux.He has done nothing, Malizar said.And now he will die.I can feel his pulse weaken.Minutes are all you have, General  Minutes are all I need.What have you done?Yux asked again.This High Chamber is far beneath the surface, yes?Yes, Wivartha said.Built upon the Crilshan database?Yes.And directly below the hub of the Crilshan Surrogate Sun.The last words did not form a question.Everybody in the room gasped at once.You havent!Yux cried.It was a trap?Ruben nodded.Your populace living above usabove the hubwill survive, my friend.But we  Malizars hand wrapped fiercely around his throat, fear filling his twisted features.How long?My dear Cronat  Tell me how long!Ruben leaned toward his beaten foe.This is for my girls.He raised both arms with one final labour of strength, pushed the switch on his wrist, activating the blast.Malizar twisted to run, but at once the walls and the ground and their very bodies shook as the many levels which made up the Surrogate Sun fell upon themselves, crashing towards them with an unimaginable furore.A thunderous roar filled their ears, and Ruben wept.His last thoughts were with Anna and Glana, and, as he slipped away, he prayed that there was someoneanyone, anybody at allout there to watch over them ...Seventy Seven      Had it been fear which had carried Antal Justus to this dark moment, possible in millions and yet sadly inevitable, conceivable only in dreams and in nightmares, then he did not know it.Knelt upon the ground, the anger flooding through his veins fuelled a fury which caused him to cry aloud; and he screamed in agony for the loss he had endured once more.And the beasts surrounding him, which had never felt a resonance like the rage of a fearless man, for an instant backed away, into the shadows, not knowing who or what in Erebus this mighty man was.Hed not been strong enough.From the moment hed realised they had to come down here, he knew they wouldnt make it out alive.But every ounce of his being wanted to see his friends again, to sit at the helm of the Flux and feel the familiar surge of emotion and power fill his body.Glimpsing the glaring image of Annas face disappear as she fell to her death, however, he realised he no longer wanted to leave.Hed held her terrified gaze as she slipped away into the pure white light and Erebus unending darkness.Much like  Justus!Ferranti yelled.Theres nothing we can do now!Theyre coming!COME ON!Ferranti broke into a run towards one of the tunnels leading out of the central chamber, unaware that something lay in his path.Justus once again hesitated, and stood on the brink of the precipice, at the edge of everything.There was no way Anna could have survived the fall, but somehow he found a small glimmer of hope within that she was down there, helpless but alive.The sphere of firelight in the heart of the chamber continued to burn and surge a malevolent white; he couldnt pull himself away from it.Then the hissing resonated throughout the chamber much louder than before, and something took hold of him from behind.He twisted to see Ferrantis tearful face through his life suits visor, burning brightly like the flames behind.She might yet be alive, Justus pleaded.We ...We can still save her.Yes, we can, Ferranti said.But only if we get out of here now.Okay, but where?Ferranti looked to the ground and, kneeling down, picked up Annas swiss knife.And as the white flame licked the air around them, it struck the knife and the torch within it suddenly shone fiercer than any battery could allow; it illuminated the far cave wall and a single tunnel leading out.And so, with a lingering yet rekindled hope, they bolted into the unknown, a small torch and a single weapon between them, the triumphant bellows of the beasts tearing after.* * *  They scurried through impossible tunnels, helping each other over large jutting black rocks and inside small passageways requiring them to crawl tightly through.Clawing hands forever reached after them.We have to go down, Justus said, tearing ahead.As far down as we can.Im not leaving without her!Nor am I, said Ferranti as he rushed to keep up.Her uncle trusted me; I gave him my word, and now Ive failed him.It was I who brought you here, he said.If youre looking for someone to blame, lay it with me.It sounds like youve already done that.Its all been down to me.Ive run constantly.Well Im not leaving Anna down there!We wont.This way!Ferranti aimed the torchlight ahead.They descended a steep bank, smooth at several points, which appeared as though they could have been carved from the otherwise sharp and terrible rock face.Upon realising that they had reached a winding crossroads, the two halted.Ferranti moved the torch right.Justus aimed his coil to the left.Both breathed deeply.Which way?Ferranti asked.What does it matter?We live or we die.Fair enough.Left.The crimson path.Lead the way.Justus moved swiftly through, aware that one of those things could emerge around a corner at any moment.How is it you even ended up here?Ferranti asked after some minutes of non stop sprinting.Lets not talk, Justus replied.I heard what Anna said to you up there, before the beast came.You havent met before, have you?No.But you dreamt of her?Yes.And she dreamt of you.Justus stopped.So she says.He turned to face him.For the past year Ive dreamt of that orb, that fire, that black flame up there.In some way I think it drove me to leave everything behind.I made myself believe I was leaving for the good of my friends.But I was running away ...running here.Just like when I left Earth.He held his breath, unable to believe hed actually said the words.For a long time hed never mentioned his old home, and his sudden confession had taken him by surprise.Ferranti, however, said nothing of it and urged him forwards; and they made a start once again.You have a choice now, Justus.I abandoned my friends, he said.I cant go back.Thats why Im here.Thats why Ive become what I have.Running away wasnt the reason.Losing faith in yourself is what caused you to make the wrong choices.Justus kept moving.He did not answer.Red and white light continued to guide them.They helped each other over a range of ridges, large and overhanging; and with each turncorner, climb, and crevicethey stumbled lower.Eventually they emerged within another deep chamber.Despite the searing heat within the suits, shivers trickled down Justus spine.He gulped and raised his coil, illuminating the many bodies now lay twisted and discarded in their way.Twenty ...thirty ...forty bodies spread before them.All were human, though most lacked any sort of space gear.The two captains moved cautiously through.Is Anna here?Can you see her?Ferranti asked.No.Justus breathed deeply inside his scorching helmet.Shes not here.Those that had them have all been stripped of their helmets.Everyone suffocated.Can you see her?Ferranti?Ferranti had stopped moving.Justus backed up towards him and looked to where the captain had aimed his torchlight.Justus swore.My thoughts exactly, Ferranti said.Are those what I think they are?Yep.He leaned in closer and reached out to touch the black cave wall.Etched into the rock, as large as a man, were gaunt shapes ...figures of beasts.He trained the light of the coil up high and followed the progression of frightening outlines: depictions of the beasts of the Labyrinth in biting horror among the darkness of the maze.If only Ketrass were here, he said.Cave drawingsha!Just wait.Theres more.As the outlines moved along they quickly became grander, taller, and a great deal more alien.Dark beings, horned from head to toe, stood above the beasts, as though to command them, in bizarrely rendered movements, cruel and otherworldly.Well ...thats new.Those beasts came from these ...these taller beings.Ferranti took his arm tight.We dont have time to stop.Justus consented, and they moved on.Any fire theyd held inside quickly waned and the reality of their situation set in.How were they going to find Anna amid a maze of black?Would they be able to get back up if they were to find her?The crushing weight of the labyrinth, the icy sensation in his injured arm, and the burden of guilt ate away at what little strength he had left.The two stumbled down another embankment, bordered by yet more carvings of beasts and masters, until only a barely visible crest mired their way.Over the ethereal edge they gazed, and down into a field of black; the red and white light shone down just enough for the two to make out what lay below.Justus almost dropped the coil and beside him Ferranti threw his hands over his mouth in shock as they stared down upon a graveyard of black bone.Moving black bone.Stirring in the presence of a frailer and altogether more fearful species, the beings below gazed up at the two captains.And then, the echo as of vast, countless serpents circled through the chamber; the ground rose up and thousands upon thousands of horned beasts of bone scaled the black rock towards them.Without having to look to one another, they ran.Racing back the way they had wandered Justus wildly fired the coil at the hissing beasts now tearing through the tunnel in pursuit.Two or three were knocked back, but the army they had awoken no bolt, blaster, or battalion could break.Ferranti shone the beam down another tunnel before taking Justus by the scruff of the neck and dragging him down.A beast surfaced before them, wedging itself into the gap.Justus fired and a burning bolt of blood hit it dead on.They ran left, and down a steep verge.Another bounded in their way.Justus fired the coil and yanked his counterpart down another passage leading away.A sheer drop followed, and at the bottom the two found their feet, fortunately unscathed, before sliding through a small gap, only just accessible through their leaner than most builds.The life suits remained intact.The beasts behind hissed and shrieked, trapped on the other side, unable to fit through.Ferranti swore.I need a drink!You and me both!When  Wait!He held his coil up.You hear it?Where are they?I dont know!Behind us.Another hissing broke out around them, and though they took off down another tunnel, they were once again pursued.But this time there was no way out.A deep fracture in the rock met them; a cliff across which they had no hope of leaping.Behind them shapes advanced.We cant jump across!Ferranti said.Our only chance is to jump down.But were dead either way!Okay then, Justus said.We jump.Are you mad?!Most definitely!We cant!Something old but familiar bubbled up within Justus at that moment; and with a broad smile on his sweating face he looked at the captain beside him, and then to the mass of black behind.He closed his eyes, took Ferrantis arm, and said, Goodbye chaps!They jumped.Seventy Eight      Araman Alwar held his hands behind his back, fingers unfeeling, as he shivered in the cold expanse of the dock, gazing out of the hangar casement at Tempest Beta below.He had stood at this point and looked out at the glowing sphere many times during his stay.Even now it grasped his mind with a deadly, alluring beauty.With the lights behind him dimming he was soon able to see waves of light appear in the upper atmosphere of the world as flashing forks streaked across the raging anvil and traces of charged particles rose up above the glowing cloud line.The electrostatic energy emitted and gathered in the magnetosphere of the planet was in fact what powered Erebus station.The close, synchronous orbit of the asteroid allowed for energy to be harvested.Araman had been involved with improving the original model for this.It was the very reason Constantine Lesper had invited him here in the first place.Upon arrival all that time agothat is to say ten years, two months, and thirteen dayshe had never imagined this would be his fate.He had thought at first that his time here would go so fast, among all the strange and unimaginable things he would be seeing and doing; but in reality every day had passed with the momentum of a decade.It was as though he had been here forever.Lifting the hood of his jacket above his head he attempted to prevent the numbness now deadening his ears.His mind had already dulled, his attention focused on one thing and one thing alone: helping Antal Justus from within the Labyrinth.As he stood gazing out, the sound of racing footsteps came charging behind him.Private Riess appeared at the same window.He had expected it to be Ketrass, and wondered how things with her and Kramer could have gone.Riess cleared his throat.What have you found out?Araman asked calmly.Everyone Ive s ...spoken to is loyal t ...t ...to Kramer, Riess stuttered.Hes got them all eating out of his h ...hand.Theyre scared, he said, now shivering too.Kramer can offer them a way out.Theyll do anything he wants to get away from here.We cant fight that.Riess yawned.His eyes were blood shot, as exhausted as it was possible to be; his breath drifted before him for several seconds.Theyre shutting everything down, Araman said.The temperatures plummeted.Lights are just about gone.Gravity and oxygen ducts are all thats left.And what about those people, t ...trapped down there?the private asked.I guess theres no hope for them now.Araman turned his head.Dont say that, Riess.Theres always a little hope, even if it only belongs to one of us.Well ...what do you think we should do?He moved closer and whispered, The barricade starting from the mess hall in Section Five runs right down into Section Six.From what Ive heard, the fortified levels are staggered, meaning there is a chance, if you can get through the greatest concentration in the mess hall.We have to find a way to tear it down, and quick.If they make it, the Captain and the others will try to come up that way.Ill try and do what I can.Dont try, Araman said.We have to do it or they die.And so do we.Go now.Riess nodded.What are you going to do?We need all the soldiers up here so that youre free to break through, he said.Ill ensure you have some time, and arent interrupted.Yes, s ...sir.The private marched away with no haste to spare.Araman turned to look back out at the storm filled world.What would become of them all by morning, he could not imagine.Within minutes, just as he had expected, though it had taken longer than he had hoped, Avne Ketrass entered the hangar and marched right up to him.He turned to her.Her eyes were red and she looked stern and unforgiving.Araman reached out a hand to her, but she pulled away.You were going to just let me kill him!she snapped.What?You had no intention of doing it yourself!I would if I could, he retorted.He surrounded himself with a personal guard.You know you were the only one that could get close!Oh, I got close, she said.Close enough to see that hes right.I dont understand.Theres something down there ...on the planet.It got Lesper, and Kramer plans on going down to find it, just as soon as the crafts ready.She nodded over to the other end of the platform, where a dozen of Kramers men were rushing into position around the craft, stopping anyone from boarding.The exterior panels that had been removed were already being placed back on.Theyre ready, he said.Kramers preparing the girl at this moment.She took his hand and whispered, Araman, we have to work with him.He shook his head.Its the only way.You know I cant do that.Then youve chosen the wrong side.It is not I that has chosen, he said.You turned your back on common sense and morality the moment you allied yourself with that madman.He lowered his voice.Youll kill us all!Her hand connected with his face; in the cold it coursed through him like scalding water.I am doing what is best for everyone!she cried.The evil beneath us will spread and consume everything else unless we deal with it here and now!Its too late to run away.No, he said, grasping her hand.Its not too late.Theres nothing you can do.We have to run.You spineless thing!How about thinking of someone else?Thats exactly what I am doing!Youre only thinking about yourself!Thats not true.None of us ever wanted this.And what Xerin Kramer is doing to that girl  That girl is pregnant!she hissed.Silence lingered between them.Only the nearby clamour of heavy boots and clinking metal could be heard.After a time Ketrass sighed.Kramer has collated most of the data and research that has taken place here over the years.Hes not giving up on it all so easily.He is going to resume the testing he and Lesper started, aided by my research of the rock and its properties, using the girl.And the baby?Araman closed his eyes and reached into his pocket.I cant let that happen.And before he realised what he was doing, he had taken her arm, twisted her round, and thrust the tip of the blaster into her back.She stiffened up in shock and slowly he pushed past the workers, moving through towards Section Five.She went to speak, but he cut her off.One word about Justus or the Labyrinth and youll wish you didnt, he said.Youve chosen what is important to you.So have I.   She said nothing.Kramers door opened swiftly and Araman forced Ketrass to enter first.Kramer, who had been sat alone at his desk, stood rapidly and as Ketrass landed on her knees he aimed the blaster, took a shot at the professor, but missed his neck by inches.The screen behind him shattered in a crackling flash.Araman, no!Ketrass cried.Kramer raised a pistol of his own.Araman took another shot, missed, and Kramer fell back, dropping the firearm.He had to do this.He had to delay them enough so that Antal could get out.He picked up Kramers dropped pistol and spun, jamming the door behind him, before proceeding to move rapidly around the room, exploring the corners for hidden scientists or soldiers.Satisfied they were alone, he forced the two into the far corner and he sat down himself.Ketrass shivered but Kramer merely breathed out, indifferent and cold.Avne didnt kill me, and neither will you, boy.Be quiet, he told him, directing the blaster at the two whilst checking the Driad girls vital signs.From what he could tell she seemed all right; she was breathing normally, at least, merely sedated for the time being.What have you done to her?Why, nothing.Kramer smirked.And now I doubt well get the chance.Well done, Alwar.Youre single handedly ruining any prospect of understanding those creatures wed have had.By injecting the unborn foetus of a teenage girl?Araman cried.Ketrass gasped.Is that what you planned to do?Nobody chooses the circumstances, Kramer said.Yes, they do.I do, he said.I wont let you.A loud thumping came from the other side of the door, coupled with the muffled but noticeably tense cries of soldiers.Kramer took a comm device from his coat pocket and looked to Araman.May I?he asked.Araman nodded.This is Professor Kramer, he declared.There is a malfunction with the hatch, almost certainly due to the fluctuating power reserves.Nothing to worry about.Its being handled from inside here.No!Araman panicked.The soldiers had to keep their attention up here.Riess couldnt have anyone running round in the mess hall.He strode across the room, snatched the comm from Kramer, and shouted, Stay away from the door!Its set to explode, and I doubt youll need any more delays if you want to escape before the beasts come back!And with that he slammed the comm into the table, where it fractured into pieces.Kramer put his hands together and applauded.I didnt know you had it in you, Alwar, he said.But I do have one question.And that is?What now?Seventy Nine      Wake up, Anna.Wake up, my baby.Anna rolled over and breathed out.Her head lolled back, though the muddle of numbness and agony threw her head spinning.For a long time she lay still, curled up tightly.When she listened, the slightest movement or whisper warning her eardrums like an intimate echo, there was no silence; there was no deep dark or mysterious tremor beneath her feet.She was alone, and no one was coming for her.Eventually she realised she had no choice but to move; and so she opened her eyes, breathed in deeply, and looked up.Something gazed down at her.It was faceless.It watched.It was dark, and yet it burned.The dark grew into a brightness too intense.Her ears popped.The white flame above grew until it scalded her mind.It looked within her, and it knew her, and it stepped into her soul.At once she felt strong and powerful and angry, no longer tainted by horror or despair.But as she stood and looked up, a low roar and a howling wind encircled her.The black ground below trembled, shadows reached up to grasp her ankles, and an echoing voice, dark and deep and horrifying, spoke:  YOU WISH FOR YOUR SISTER, it said, and she fell to her knees as it echoed through her.THAT SHE MAY BE SAFETHAT HE WHO TOOK HER TO DIE!She did not reply, and the voice spoke again.YOU KNOW WHAT HE IS DOING TO HER UP THERE.YOU KNOW HE WILL HURT HER.YOU KNOW HERE IN YOUR SOUL YOU WILL NOT SEE HER AGAIN UNLESS YOU DESTROY HIM!I cant!YES, YOU CAN!YOU WANT TO TAKE HIS HEART IN YOUR HAND, AND SQUEEZE THE LIFE FROM HIS BODY!Yes, she thought.Thats exactly what I want to do!YOU HAVE THAT POWER.DO IT.Take a life?IT IS EASY ...YOU CAN DO IT, ANNA BERENGUER.GO.NOW.But then, from the corner of her mind, another voice spoke.No, my baby.Stay where you are.Listen to me ...Anna turned.Veiled in the white flame, still and calm, stood a woman; she was blonde, beautiful, and fair.Mother?DO NOT LISTEN TO HER!the voice uttered, and the room shook.YOU CANNOT TRUST HER.SHE IS ONLY AN IMPRESSION IN YOUR MIND.A MEMORY OF WHAT YOU WERE ...Listen to me, Anna, her mother said.Get out of here.Find your sister and get away!QUIET, BITCH!SHE KNOWS HER MINDIT IS ALREADY MADE!Anna reached out for her mother.She had seen her in her dreams forever, it seemed; now she had come back for her.Mum, Im here.Mum!But as soon as they touched, the white flame of the orb broke above, and the same horrific shrieks of anguish filled the space.Mother, no!YOU ARE ALONE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT YOU HAVE TO DO.NO!Glana!she cried, and the light retreated from inside her.Leave me!she screamed.Her mother disappeared and she fell to her knees.As she did, the breaking orb up high blistered black once more.Anna fell to the ground.Whatever it was, she could not look at it again.After several moments everything went dark, all but a delicate glow from the orb.It looked just like it did in her dreams.A stinging sensation shot through her hand.She lifted it and saw blood seep through the glove from a deep cut in which was buried a shard of broken armour.She pulled it out.It was only then that she questioned where the sharp piece had come from.The life suit!Anna clawed desperately at her visor, only to find that there was nothing between her and the seemingly alien air.Awestruck, she took the helmet slowly from her head, to find that she could breathe.She looked around the chamber, situated below the ominous orb.Though the fire burned black above her once more, it was as though the white flame of the sphere had remained behind her eyes.She gazed at the black rock and saw through it; the Black Labyrinth was no longer a maze but a clear network of organised tunnels.And the higher she looked, the more she realised that she would never find the others and get to her sister as well.She stood.How?How did I even survive the fall, never mind find myself able to see where I am?As though in answer to her question, which itself resonated throughout the underpinning chamber and the surrounding tunnels, she realised the answer.The black bracelet she had found up above before her fall seemed almost burned into her arm.It would not move.It was fixed.It did not hurt and she felt neither cold nor heat.The bracelet, she said to herself.I put it on and touched the orb.And then it tried to pull me in.Failing that I fell down here.She looked up.You looked into me, didnt you?You saw the darkness and the light.And I saw your evil.I dont want it!Silence.All she had ever wanted was to experience life outside of her home on Titan.It had seemed such a cage, but now all she wanted to do was be back there, to sit with her uncle and her sister.She cried at the thought of Glana, alone and frightened, with that old man doing things she did not want to imagine.I will get you back, sis.Im coming for you.She wiped away her tears and held herself firm; she had to focus.Losing hope would not help to get her sister back.It was best that she was angry and determined than afraid and distracted.Thats what her uncle had taught her.She knew what he would tell her to do right now were he here.Ferranti and Justus were still out there.She had to get to them.Glana needed her.Without delay she removed the rest of the life suit and stood back in her Titanese overalls.Looking around and listening as hard as she could, she could make out voices and hisses calling out all around, some distant, others close, and so she moved off through the pitch black tunnels.She could see her way through the dark, but had no idea how.After what felt like hours, having moved through a series of small tunnels leading steadily higher, she turned a corner and continued through into a larger chamber.Unable to make herself stop even for a second, she entered another.Eventually she looked out over a wide chasm, and a hand seized her ankle.A figure looked up from the ground, gasping for breath, and clad in a yellow space suit.Naffan!she said.Commander Naffan, youre alive!Can you move?No, he said, struggling to breathe.Please dont leave me.I wont.I wont.Stay ...with me.Anna looked around.Shapes she had not noticed now moved everywhere.Naffan, I  Please.Through the helmet she could see his eyes begging.She couldnt leave him now, and so took his hand and knelt down.Im sorry this has happened to us ...to you.I told you wed be okay, but I was wrong.Im ...Im sorry.Another sound nearby.Rocks shifted.Movement in the shadows.Somethings here.We should move.Come on, Naffan, Ill help you up.More shadows crawled across the room.She turned back to the elderly man.Naffan?Commander Naffan?A tear rolled down her cheek.He was already gone, his eyes closed, his old face pale yet peaceful.Anna stood gradually, wiping her eyes, and stopped.Even as she looked, an arm reached around the closest corner.It was dark, long, and thin.Black boned, the horned demon appeared in her path.She did not attempt to run, but remained still, forcing herself to breathe in short gasps.The beast moved forward on all fours, close to the ground.Razor sharp teeth draped over the corners of its severe snout.It crept closer, silently watching her through eyes concealed within folds of dark skin.It reached her, and stood to full height, towering over her.Trembling, she closed her eyes.Eighty      The blonde girl stirred.Eyes moved beneath her eyelids.She remained still, not yet conscious.Araman looked down at her.Im going to save you.Im going to save you all.Xerin Kramer moved from where he sat upon the ground, and leaving Ketrass on her knees found his feet.Stay there, Araman said, stepping forward, angling the blaster.How long are you planning on playing this game, boy?Until I get what I want.Pray tell me.He looked to Avne.I know what it is youre planning on doing.I very much doubt that, Alwar.Either everyone leaves or no one does.Okay.Kramer smiled.No one does.Ketrass followed the professor and stood, a frown sweeping across her facial muscles.Ive had enough of this, she said.You want the soldiers up here, dont you?What?Youre creating a distraction so you can get Justus out of Erebus.Kramer watched the daggers they aimed at each other, a look of delight on his face, and said, Very clever, Avne.Pointless as it is to try.How is he attempting to do it?Theyre on their way through the Black Labyrinth at this very moment, she said.Avne, no, Araman said.Are you sure thats the right thing to do?the Professor asked.It was the only way  No, I mean are you sure saving the Captain is the right thing to do?Araman leaned forward.What the hell are you talking about?Of course it is, you callous man.Harsh words, Kramer said.Then again, you dont know what I know.Which is what?Kramer stood slowly and walked to the window overlooking the planet below.Araman kept the blaster pointed at him.There is a greater danger here that I didnt tell you before, that I havent told anyone.Only Lesper and I knew about the design, about the trap.The two listened intently.What was it he knew?There is a man out there not of our time, Kramer said.You have heard the old tales of the legendary Istron race?Yes, Araman said.And have you heard the tales they tell of the Istrons powerful leader, Peter Marx?Ketrass nodded.Most people have, even if they dont know the name.Kramer smiled.Well, I have something to tell you both.Peter Marx, it would seem, has been on this station with us for some time.Araman leaned forwards, lowering the blaster.When the Istron society of the Four Systems faileda long time ago nowPeter Marx, along with the majority of his people, disappeared.Very few have been seen since.He who believes them to be truly gone is a fool.One man has been hunting them: my Cronat, our master, has spent his life in pursuit of Peter Marx.A few short weeks ago, Lesper found him.He is not human and cannot die like the rest of us.He is dangerous and intends on destroying our entire operation.So far he has succeeded in infecting Lesper, releasing the imprisoned beasts, and setting them loose.How and for what purpose I can only guess, but we have information on him dating back centuries.He has followers on this station that are helping him, even now.Ketrass edged alongside him.Professor, what are you saying?I am saying, my dear, that our new captain, Antal Justus, cannot die.He cannot be killed and will not succumb to old age.His real name is Peter Marx, and Lesper and I, on instruction from our master, lured him into coming here.Araman, our quiet little friend, has been fooled too.No, he said.What are you going to do?Kramer looked Ketrass dead in the eye.Peter has been under our scrutiny since he first arrived.Every middle ranking soldier was briefed on him, observed and watched him.We tested Peters reliability by sending him under the watchful eyes of his soldiers to the outpost Aurora, after which I sought evidence of his loyalty, ordering him to send the prisoners down into the station.Alas, he failed, and will now remain trapped, down among the catacombs, forever.What about me?You will come with me, Avne.You are quite safe.And Araman?Araman Alwar, he said, I am going to kill.Araman raised his head, looked at Kramer, saw the pistol in his hand.Kramer pulled the trigger.At once he felt the furious, knife like blow tear through his shoulder.His head spun.Multicoloured rays of light filled his vision.A blinding heat flushed through his face as he fell from the chair and onto his back.Eighty One      A deep roar sounded among the caverns.Justus opened his eyes and stared into a mass of black.Another roar was quickly answered by a spine chilling hiss.He reached out with both hands, grasping for something with which to pull himself up.The deep thudding which at first he thought to be grating the inside of his head began to pulse through the ground beneath him.Realising he was spread out on his back, he forced himself to sit.The still form of Diego Ferranti lounged nearby.The torch lay discarded between them, its beam burning faintly at the far wall.Ferranti?No reply.Ferranti, can you hear me?A dull hum entered his helmet.There was still a connection.He leaned over and shoved him.Ferranti!Uhh ...huh?What?You scared the hell out of me!He grunted.Whatever.What  A roar shook them where they sat.What the hell was that?!A shiver flew down Justus spine.Wheres it coming from?Ferranti whispered.I ...err ...I dont know.Ferranti stood, picked up the torch.Lets get the hell out of this tunnel.They looked up and simultaneously grasped their miraculous stroke of luck, having tumbled down a steep hollow, suits somehow undamaged.Both stumbled along again, down through a narrow breach.After the run in with the beastly battalion, the two meandered slowly lower, and eventually found themselves lost.Both were close to giving up.Their life suits were all set to concede defeat.They had only just come to a halt, exhausted, when another cavernous snarl echoed towards them; it was impossible to tell from which direction it had ricocheted.But to both of them it was clear: whatever it was was certainly larger than a beast.Rushing on down a small channel they snaked around spiked barbs jutting out from the dense walls and doing their upmost to impale them, before emerging in another tunnel, almost as large as the central chamber in which they had lost Anna.Justus stared straight ahead.Something moved in the distance.The ground beneath them shook once more in rapid thumps.The trembling grew greater, faster, and more powerful.Then they heard the roar once more: a sound which made the hissing of the beasts more akin to a serene melody.The two men looked to each other in dread, and made ready to run; but as they turned they found that they would have stood, were there any light, in the shadow of a creature unimaginable.It gazed down at them with two burning eyes and seemed to sneer through jagged, unevenly bladed teeth, set into a titanic jaw.Its saliva oozed, almost seeping upon them as it leaned forward on two powerful hind legs, its short, thin arms reaching no lower than its ribcage.The rumbling at their feet grew greater as the creature behind seemed to gain speed.The coilbolt in Justus hand couldnt possibly do the monster any harm.On the count of three, he said, we go right.Uh uh, came a whimper.One!He waved the coil up high.Two!The colossal creature snapped its head towards the bright red light  THREE!Justus launched the coil far to his left while the two captains shot towards a narrow tunnel in the opposite direction.But it seemed, though speed was on their side, luck, as it would have it, was not.They charged into the dark tunnel leading from the chamberor at least what they thought was a tunnel.Reaching no more than a metre or two within, they gazed in horror at the dark dead end now facing them.Ferranti shone the light about uncontrollably, attempting to uncover a small crevice leading out.But there was nothing, only thick, black stone trapping them in all directions but one.As Justus spun and Ferranti shone the light back into the chamber leading out they both vaulted back.A horrifying face moved within.Its huge, thick flexing tongue grabbed and searched; the roaring echoing around them threatened to burst their ear drums.Justus regretted throwing his weapon away and he prayed that, were Anna alive, she hadnt been found by one of these things.What do we do?Ferranti cried, fast losing control.Stay calm.Think!The monsters jaws reached their limit, while its tongue stretched out, scalpel like barbs extended from within, now mere inches from Justus, who pushed himself up against the far wall.Closing his eyes he struggled to focus his breathing.He pictured somewhere happy, somewhere, anywhere but this nightmare.He sat at the helm of the Flux, his hands about the controls.Dimal, Noah, Raj, and Shree all smiling at his side  Justus!His eyes shot open as Ferranti struck headlong into the creatures jaws, assailing the black tongue with the swiss knife, and a roar filled their ears.The enormous head shot up, breaking the low roof of the cave and forcing down a mass of rock on top of them.Justus coiled himself into a ball and waited for the noise of collapsing rock and chilling roars to abate, before jumping up and searching desperately for Ferranti amongst the rubble.He sighed as he found the captain still alive.He checked both suits for signs of damage, and his face burned when he found a tear in his own, around the right elbow.He held his arm over the split and attempted to move, knee deep in slabs of black rock.Ferranti, you hear me?!Ferranti, also knee deep, having been driven up into the wall, made no reply.Justus saw the swiss knife and torch still in the others hand; with his aching left arm covering his right elbow he reached across with his right arm and lifted the light from Ferrantis grasp to find it had extended into a somewhat sizeable blade.Hardly able to move, he pushed the dagger back in and aimed the light at the tunnel entrance.The creature had disappeared.Instead, stood still in the opening of the tunnel, was  Anna?A figure moved forwards.Anna, is that you?Whatever it was wore no life suit.Antal?came the reply.He almost burst into tears.Im here!Ferranti and I, were here!Anna bounded forwards and began shifting the larger rocks to make a path in which they could move.With her help, he and Ferranti scrambled from inside the opening; but upon leaving he fell to the ground as the sight before him almost stopped his heart there and then.The two monstrous creatures stared down at him, their emaciated chests heaving under might, weight, and bone.And all around, like stones surrounded by boulders on a mountainside, the beasts waited, eagerly.Their horns rocked from side to side, watching, waiting.Its okay, Anna said, almost calmly.Her eyes were focused, stern.They wont hurt you ...I think.How do you know?he asked.How are you breathing?Can we all  Anna shook her head and presented her arm, upon which seethed a band of black; it glowed as though it had been dyed or burned into her skin.Something happened up there, when I put this on, she said.You touched the orb, he said.I heard that word.Gilaxiad.What happened?She looked away down the tunnel, teeming with motionless, gazing beasts.Im not sure.But its all connected.It has to be.My presence is stopping these things for now, but I dont know how long thatll last.She looked him in the eye, before holding out his advanced coil.Dont lose this.Something tells me youre going to need it.She tapped Ferrantis helmet and he began to stir.He gazed up at the beasts and the creatures close by.Anna held a finger to her lips and smiled.She seemed different somehow, like she wasnt scared.How could she not be scared?Were lost, Ferranti whispered.We have no idea where we are.I do, she said.You can follow me.Justus looked down to his torn suit and motioned for her to help him.Inside the pocket of each was a minor patch up kit, enough to mend the split at least.She took it out and began securing his suit, while Ferranti remained rooted to the spot.How did you survive?Justus asked her.You fell so far.The bracelet, she said.It did something, like it wanted me.I ...She breathed in and out slowly, and shook her head as though remedying some internal thought.I found Commander Naffan.Hes gone.But after that, one of them found me.She affixed the second layer of adhesive substance to his arm and wrapped a tight binding around it.What happened?It moved towards me, slowly, on all fours ...and then stood above me.One of its fingers ...she shook her head again ...touched me and stroked my face.I whimpered and whispered, Please, stop it.But it didnt.Please ...stop, I said.And then it stopped, and backed away, and turned towards the wall.It obeyed you?I told it to leave.The thing seemed to bow, and then left me alone.She went to continue, but seemed to think better of it.There was something else, something she was holding back, but they needed to move, so he didnt push it.She moved to help Ferranti to his feet.We go.Now.And she started off, leading the way; Justus followed second, and Ferranti hobbled after holding the swiss torch.They weaved their way through the beasts, trembling at the sight of the creatures, waiting for them to strike, to tear them limb from limb.Theyre watching us, Justus said.Dont stare back, she told them.Do they even have eyes?It doesnt matter.They can see us somehow.How do you know this?Ferranti asked.Shhh, she replied with an unsettling air of composure.Something here is very wrong, Anna.Arent you cold?Justus whispered.I dont feel cold or warm, she said.Its the bracelet.Its done something to me ...like its keeping me alive.When they reached the end of the hordes of beaststhey must have passed thousands, he had no doubtthe many creatures began to follow.Justus felt like they should be running, but Anna wouldnt let them.The demons followed slowly on all fours, crawling and watching, but never hissing.After a while Ferranti stepped ahead and took her arm.Anna, tell me whats going on.How do you know where youre going?We could be going in circles  Were not.How do you know?!Ferranti, she said.You told me that people say ultimatt power gives engines life.Yes, but thats a theory among scores.So what?Well, thats what it felt like in the chamber.Diego, that orb called to me.When I put the bracelet on I felt connected to it, and touching the orb it ...it somehow felt  Alive?Justus said.Alive.Yes, exactly.You mean this place, he said, staring around, this place ...its ...living?No, Anna said.Not the rock.The power source at its centre.Just like on our vessels.I think this whole place is a vessel ...a ship ...a  Interstellar spacecraft transport, Ferranti finished.Anna smiled fearfully, nodded.Justus gulped.A vessel you just fired up.Eighty Two      The three moved faster now, aware that time was short.According to the life suits over ninety minutes had passed since they first put them on.Oxygen levels were low, their energy was dwindling, and the beasts continued to follow behind.But Anna knew where she was going.She could see, hear, and feel all of Erebus.So many hidden paths and darkened tunnels she wished she could have seen.After a short while, however, relief filled all of their beings as the first sign of humanity confirmed her ability; and the same scene as that on the other side of the station lay before them: the ground was littered with torn metal.Sheets of reinforced steel were piled before them, and the three clambered through.The last hatch was still open.One of the beasts must have been through recently, before the timer had run out and sealed it shut.Ill go first, Ferranti said, glancing behind; the beasts crept slowly along.Anna followed second, and as she did Justus hissed, Anna, stop!They halted in the muted light of the room and Anna turned.The metal hatch leading from the Black Labyrinth stood open behind them, the beasts watching from the shadows.What is it?Youre ...Youre shivering.Anna raised her hand.He was right.She was trembling.Without warning her body went into spasm.The severe cold grasped and her vision diminished.The bracelet!she cried.Weve left the Labyrinth.I cant She fell to her knees, gasped for breath.The concealed creatures hissed threateningly.Help me!Justus shouted to Ferranti and together they slammed the huge door closed.At once the demons on the other side pummelled the hatch, crying aloud and breaking in.Ferranti left Anna lay on the ground and raced over among the control panels.Justus remained at her side.Hold on, Anna.Try and breathe!Ferranti, what are you doing?Ferranti pressed and pulled a number of switches and levers, cursed loudly, and then moved to another panel.Help her!One problem at a time!he said, flicking a further series of switches, reading the information on the screen.I recognise this system!Come on!One moment!He jumped up and a great cloud of gas poured into the room from above.Backup oxygen, he said with a smile.Anna took enormous gasps of air, filling her lungs completely and leaning her head on Justus strong shoulder; his arm stretched around her.The pounding on the hatch continued.The two captains raced to remove their cumbersome life suits.But they turned and gasped as a loud hissing filled the room.The rim of the hatch broke, disturbing the seal and what oxygen they had began to escape through the breach.This way!cried an unfamiliar voice unexpectedly.I said this way, d ...damn it!A man stood behind them, torch in hand.Riess!Justus exclaimed.Ha!If there was one man I hadnt expected!No time for introductions, Ferranti again took Annas hand and they all charged from Section Six as the hatch behind gave way.Justus and Riess slammed the next hatch shut.A pounding shook it on its hinges.What is this?Justus asked.Lespers escape tunnel.Kramers been looking for it.I found it first.Riess led them quickly higher, up through the station.The beasts would be following close behind.Hurry, he urged.Theyre ready to leave at any moment!Wheres Araman?They have him, Captain.He tried to hold them up, to give you time and rescue the pregnant girl.Pregnant!Anna gasped.Riess looked to her.Yes, pregnant.The doctors were s ...speaking of it.I dont think anybody knows.Shes your sister?Yes!Didnt you know?In those few second everything at last made sense: her sickness, her sadness, and Jon.His last word was her name.Did he know?Was he the father?No, she replied.I didnt know.I thought she was sick, after travelling on board the Stellarstream for the first time and without medical attention.You should have told me she was unwell, Ferranti said.Stop!Justus hissed as they reached the end of the narrow tunnel, turning at once to Riess.Did you close this door behind you?Ye ...Yes, Captain.And did anybody know you were coming down here?No.Did anybody see you come down here?N ...No.Why?Justus took out his coil and pushed its jagged tip against the door, which creaked open noisily.An empty corridor, steeped with a dim red light, peered through.Justus guided them out and along the passage, where they moved down in single file until they came upon a ladder well.Justus clambered up first and then turned backed for Anna.As soon as she had clambered up, however, he ignited his coil and charged unswervingly down the corridor and into a nearby room.She went to follow, but froze as a hiss rang out behind them.Too close.Ferranti and Private Riess scrambled up and slammed the top of the hatch closed.Itll only do to s ...slow them down.Theyll catch up eventually.Ferranti picked up his firearm again.Wheres he gone, Anna?Justus!Im here!he called back, returning from the nearby room.Lets hurry.What was in that room?she asked him.Answers, was all he said.It took only a minute to reach the foot of another ladder well.The four moved quietly, Justus climbing first, moving slowly up the iron rails.Then he stopped.Blasters triggered.Justus raised his coil.Red light, screams, and a loud CRACK and BOOOM filled the room above.Justus forced his way up and the others followed to find the three armed men that had been waiting for them lay upon the ground, smoke rising from their still forms.Again Ferranti and Riess closed the ladder hatch at its cap and followed Anna and Justus back through the mess hall into which the prisoners had been brought not two hours prior.The last place Anna had seen her sister.They know, said Riess, shivering in the bitter chill.Yeah, Justus agreed.They know.Whatever happens, Ferranti whispered, taking Annas arm, stay behind me.Nobody else confronted them on their way through to the dock.Anna prayed it wasnt because they had already left without them.Shivers crept along her back.She had not imagined what they would do if they made it from the labyrinth.The four were alone, and she prayed Glana was safe.As they entered the central platform, coil and guns primed, a line of armed men stood between them and the droning ship.Before the soldiers stood Kramer, motionless and cold; and on the ground before him knelt a young blond man.It was Araman.The professor forced a pistol into his head.A whimpering crowd was gathered to one side, most upon their knees, while some edged toward the ship as though they expected it to leave without them.Anna saw no sign of Glana.Justus held up his hand, stood at the front of the four, and stepped forward.Stay back, Istron!Kramer cried.Justus edged forward again, the others following slowly.I dont know what youre talking about!he said.That doesnt matter to me!Anna frowned.Did he say Istron?Riess moved alongside Justus.Listen, sir  Traitor!cried the Professor, and he raised his pistol, pointing it at Riess.The private fell to the floor, a bullet hole in his forehead.Several of the crowd screamed.The soldiers nearby remained still.Justus pointed his flickering coil at Kramer, but looked to the soldiers and the terrified crowd.This is the man youve decided to follow?A fool who would sooner kill everyone around him and stand there alone than give his life for anything or anyone that matters?!You dont know what youre talking about!cried a woman from atop the ships ramp.You dont know what were dealing with!Avne, he said, Not you ...Kramer smiled, raised the pistol once more.Anna shuddered.Antal!A bullet cut through the air and pierced Justus in the heart.He fell back, dropped the coil, the back of his head cracked upon the ground.NO!Anna cried.No, no, NO!And she was not alone.As the larger and bolder of the whimpering crowd now collided with the soldiers, some of the black clad guards bounded in their direction.They took hold of Anna and Ferranti, dragging them away.But Araman clambered to his feet, raced for Justus, and pulled him up, gripping his body and holding up his head.He raised his hand, blood filling his palm.You fool!he screamed.Kramer stepped above them.This thing is dangerous.He is a Istron.No, he is not!I explained this, boy.He is Peter Marx!I AM PETER MARX!Araman cried, his voice splintering as he said it.I am Peter Marx, you small minded, cruel thing!He stood slowly, and though he was shorter than the professor, in that moment he appeared twice as tall and a thousand times as mighty.Silence filled the dock in the wake of his words, bar the steady whirr of the ships engine.You lie!Kramer cried.A secret.Not a lie.Kramers eye dimmed and he stepped closer to Araman, who did not flinch as the professor leaned in.So many secrets, he said, reaching up and adjusting his face covering, removing the black metal layer to reveal a black eye.Or, rather, a black sclera surrounding a deep, red iris.So many lies!Youre Crilshan, Anna said.Both eyes flickered irregularly towards her.Half Crilshan.Half an abomination is still an abomination, Ferranti grumbled.Kramers attention did not move from Araman.You have been upon this station almost as long as I have, Alwar.I am old, but not so dull witted yet as to overlook such a deception.You are lying.You are not Peter Marx.Yes, I am, he said, all but relived.I almost forgot it myself.I very nearly wished to.This place  Youre lying!Youre trying to protect Peter Marx.Kramer pointed at Justus body.Shoot the captain again!No!Anna leapt before the soldiers, fighting to keep them away.Justus body was still.Its not Antal, Araman said.I am Peter Marx.He reached for the fallen coilbolt, but the soldier beside him clenched the back of his neck and forced him to the ground, slamming the bottom of his boot into his face.Thud!Araman cried out in agony.Anna and Ferranti, though weak and exhausted, attempted to fight their way through.Soldiers blocked their way.If you want to come with us, Kramer shouted to the group, you will prove your loyalty!Make Araman Alwar talk!A few of the group rushed forward at once and joined the soldier, kicked Araman in the stomach forcefully several times as he coughed and spluttered.Two more soldiers, hulking and black armoured, moved forward, removing their gloves.The men lifted the bloodied man from the ground while a third and fourth laid into him.More of his screams filled the hangar.Those in the beaten crowd looked away.Women sobbed.Do what you have to do to get the truth from him, Kramer said, fixing the metal plate back across face, covering the dark eye again.If you cant, then punish him.The beating continued.Anna watched desperately and shouted, Stop!Stop it!But everything moved slow and silent.Ferranti hit one of the guards and fought his way through, only to fall to the ground, stunned by the nearest coil.STOP!Kramer smiled, eyes dimmed, at the suffering taking place in front of him.Araman had helped them through Erebus.He had done all he could to help her little sister.Anna couldnt stand here and watch him beaten to death.She struggled hard; with dwindling energy she grappled with the men holding her.The men stopped beating Araman and stepped back, knuckles worn and bloodied.Their victim lay curled up on the ground.Everybody on all sides stood stunned.I have a question, Kramer said, kneeling down to the man.Why are you hurt?Why arent you healing?Araman breathed deeply, and looked up.The captain is dead.He is not the Istron.Were you actually Peter Marx, you would be healing by now, would you not?One of Aramans eyes was swollen, his face was red with blood, and he clutched his shoulder tightly.Slowly, and with great distress, he stood.I am ...Peter Marx.THEN WHERE IS YOUR POWER?!Kramer motioned and the three men, instead of moving forwards to continue the thrashing, took out their coilbolts.NO!Anna screamed.QUIET!Kramer stared at her fiercely.I ...am in control!He looked to his men.Do it.A blast of red electricity surged from one of the weapons and struck Araman in his right side.Anna stood watching, tears in her eyes, as he was knocked back, his burnt flesh visible through singed cloth.But somehow he remained standing.He took another burst of energy.Another followed.And then a fourth.People stood around cried, Stop!Thats enough!Even the line of soldiers looked to each other uncertainly.The attacks halted.The young man coughed, blood trickling down his jaw, and said, I am Peter  All three strikes of the coils collided, just missing him, and the resulting explosion caused an outbreak of flame and smoke.As the dust cleared everyone took a slow step forward.Aramans body lay sprawled upon the ground.Ferranti looked up from where he had been thrown.Anna clutched her head, pulling at her hair.I regret it had to end this way, Kramer said savagely, and he turned his back on the body.Wait!Ketrass said, clutching the ships edge in her own fit of grief.They turned to see Araman slowly stand, half alive.He looked across to Anna and Ferranti and the motionless body of Antal Justus, then nodded once, weakly.Had enough?Kramer asked, confusion and anger evident in his voice.Tell me the truth, boy.Youre not Peter Marx.Tell me, who is?The beaten and bloodied young man, whose clothes smoked and scorched from the numerous attacks, said nothing and swayed on the spot.The three soldiers took hold of him, and Kramer stepped slowly forward, drawing out a small, razor sharp knife.Now well see how immortal you are.He moved up close, looked him in the eye, and smiled.The knife was brought up to Aramans neck, touched his skin.Kramer sliced.A trail of ruby red was left in the wake of cold steel.His head dropped back, eyes gazing up through the ceiling, and the soldiers let go, backing away.His body slumped to the floor.Annas heart fell into her stomach.He was dead.Justus and Araman.Both dead.A distant hiss broke the silence, filling the hangar.They all backed up in a panic.Kramer ran to the ship, now ready to depart.Several soldiers ran ahead onboard.The face of Avne Ketrass was just as shocked as everyone elses, and she was pulled onto the ship, hesitating and uncertain.The soldiers holding Anna and Ferranti let go and backed up towards the spacecraft, their weapons trained on them still.Ferranti edged closer, wary of the coils and rifles aimed at him.Dont go.You cant go.Anna looked at the lifeless bodies of Araman and Justus on the floor, and across at Kramer, who wiped the blood from the knife onto his dark lab coat, which he then took off and flung to the ground.Another hiss rang through the dock.The beasts were coming.Time was up.Wheres my sister?Anna shouted at Kramer.Your sister is safe.She is coming with me.Youre not taking her!Kramer stopped, eyeing her wickedly.Oh, I think I am.No, youre not!Do you think this is a story, little girl?he said.Where the heroine overcomes the nasty villain despite insuperable odds, all through her courage and determination?I admire your fight and your strength, and I dont know how you survived the Labyrinth, but I am not evil.And you have no idea what is really happening here.I know that you have my sister on that ship ...and I know that youre going to give her back to me!Kramer smirked, and glanced quickly at the corridor they had entered from.Ill tell you what, little girl.Because Im not completely inhumane, Ill offer to you the choice: you may come with us now, come with us and be with your sister and live.Or stay here and die with the rest of them.The survivors edged forwards, whimpering, wary of the approaching danger.But the armed soldiers kept them back.Anna looked to Ferranti.In his dirty, sweating face she could see only desperation and fear.But she knew what she had to do.She had been through too much to be left on this hellish rock to die as her little sister was taken away forever.Go, Ferranti said.Get out of here.You have to.He nodded.Go!Anna gazed across at Antal Justus still body, and then to Araman.They had defended each other, given their lives for one another.Could anything Kramer had said be true?The Professor reached out and took her hand, and she stepped slowly forwards, moving up the ramp and into the craft.Kramer smiled as she boarded with him.But as she entered, a sharp pain filled her neck and she fell forwards, leaving Erebus and everyone she cared for behind.Eighty Three      The air howled and the ground roared like thunder beneath Diego Ferrantis knees, as though everything beneath was falling away, while a booming call rose up above; the wind blew down and around the survivorsthey who would survive no more.The craft disappeared up through the triangular crown.Then rose the bedlam.Men and women charged around, turmoil filling their fearful cries.They stormed their separate ways, but the elevator upon the far side was blocked, and from the other end now came the ominous wails of their demise.Ferranti turned and crawled towards Justus still body, and there he sat still and watched.Justus gazed up at him with empty eyes ...Wait!Strong eyes.Glistening eyes.Antal?Yeaaah?How ...?My head, Justus moaned, sitting up and reaching behind.The hissing nearby grew louder as the beasts approached, but Justus looked about, laughing.Ferranti laughed with him; and with tears falling down his face he swept his hair from in front of his eyes and sat beside him.At the end.Kramer shot you, he said.How did you ...Justus poked and prodded his chest, bewildered, and then reached inside his jacket to reveal a silver cased book.A bullet blackened the front.You lucky son of a bitch!Where did you get that?I took it from Lespers office back there.He looked at the people screaming, collapsing, attempting to get through any door they could.All were locked.Were trapped, he said.Where are they all?Wheres Anna, and ...He looked across at the battered, bloodied body of Araman, and his breathing quickened.He held his head in his hands.Im sorry, Ferranti said.Kramer cut his throat.The boy said his name was Peter Marx.I know that name.The leader of the old Istrons.But thats impossible.Ferranti watched as Justus looked to the triangular crown high above, took three deep breaths, and then gazed down at his left wrist.I think I know the reason.I ...I think its me.You think what is you?Justus turned to him  Hissing resonated along the hangar platform.Startling screams of terror from the horrified survivors.The captains turned to each other.Justus reached for his fallen coil.Ferranti lifted Riess rifle and turned to see a multitude of black creatures pour through behind them.Without thinking they both fired with all the focus and strength they could muster, slicing through the middle of the charge.But it didnt work.Hope was spent.Ferranti backed up, focusing his fire on an approaching beast.It fell to its knees, jaws snapping.Justus kicked it in the snout and pushed Ferranti back.Another came forward.He grasped Aramans body and pulled it with him.The two reached a halt, their backs against the wall.Watch out!Justus yelled as a mound of metal rained down from above.The beast lunging for them was crushed by the falling debris.Justus fired a vein of light again and again at another which tore at them.Ferranti looked up, and his jaw dropped as he witnessed a familiar spacecraft hurtling, momentously unforeseen, through the crown of the station, descending recklessly fast and triggering a torrential stream of wrenching air which pulled them from their feet.They both reached for the metal bars extending from the walls nearby; Justus grappled for Aramans arm and clung to it with all the force he could summon.Black beasts and unfortunate men and women were pulled up and out into the blank vacuity of space.In seconds Ferrantis grip had loosened and he was on the verge of losing out to the void when the craft that had smashed into the dock punched through the hangar and crashed down nearby.The crafts side compartment opened and a welcome face greeted him.Take my arm!cried Lieutenant Mica Avila above the hissing tumult.Ferranti didnt need telling twice.Reaching across he found Avilas hand and she pulled him into the Stellarstreams shuttle carrier.He picked himself up at once and cried to Justus, Throw him!Aramans limp, blood spattered corpse made it into the craft, followed quickly by Justus himself.He kicked out at a creature bounding towards them.It did not make it in.Up!Avila cried and Erebus dock disappeared as the pilot fired the engines, propelling them up and back out to space once more.The two captains collapsed to the ground, clutching their chests.Ferranti had never imagined theyd make it out, and only by the skin of their necks had they just done so.You ...survived ...Aurora?he said, gasping for air.Avila touched his head wound lightly with a towel and replied, Scarcely.If it wasnt for him.She motioned to the man sat in the co pilots seat, now steering them directly away from Erebus.Ferranti jolted to his feet.YOU!Gordian smiled back, his arm securely fastened to his seat.Youre welcome, Diego.The blond captain remained standing, silent.Then his shoulders slumped.In this dark hour, he said, I dont think there are any surprises left that would terrify me.Just as well, said Justus, because were not done yet!How did you survive Aurora?he asked her.Because of Gordian, she said.If it wasnt for him then we wouldnt have forced the Stellarstream out of docking position in time.Nor would we have been able to follow your radiation trail out here.Is that what you did?Justus asked.You followed my trail?She nodded, disgust in her face at his presence.We made it out of position and followed your ultimatt shadow to Chiro, and when we were unable to find you, Gordian suggested we monitor all outgoing vessels until we found the one you attacked with.Its somewhat similar to a Titanese carrier, so I knew what I was looking for.Very smart, Ferranti said.Gordian winked.Thank you, Captain.But why didnt you contact Titan via Chiros governor, or failing that Chiro itself, for help?Because Chiro is no longer governed by the Enusti governor, said Gordian.The Crilshan blockade has assumed command of the planet.You and your people, Ferranti fumed.We wouldnt be here if it wasnt for him, Avila said.It was he who got us here, and it was he who removed the enemy ship which just rose from the triangular base.At once both captains were on their feet.WHAT?!Please, Ferranti begged.Please dont tell me you destroyed it, Avila.Gordian, still attached his chair, cleared his throat.The craft that emerged from the base upon that moon is the one we followed here.So far as I was concerned it was an enemy craft.Plus, they fired upon us first.He laughed.It was headed away from us when we arrived, so we pursued.When we did they launched projectiles, so I responded.Ferranti stammered.You ...You destroyed it?Justus mouth hung wide open.Not completely, Gordian said.But it was certainly damaged.The craft was already headed towards the planet.Once we fired, the craft made for its original course and finished up down there.He pointed to the planet before them.* * *  The shuttle soared.Its port vessel waited in the distance for their return.Justus lunged at the young woman now steering them away and to safety.No!he told her.Turn us around!We have to go back.We have to go after the other craft!Annas down there!You are joking?she said.Are you going to pilot this thing down there?If I have to.And just exactly what kind of frenetic are you?the Crilshan posed.The very best kind.The kind of frenetic that does what he knows is right.He looked at Ferranti.Even when he realises what that is too late.Ferranti and he stared at each other, and the blond captain nodded his agreement.Turn her around, Lieutenant.Take us down.But Captain  Id prefer not to have to pull rank, he said.This is a military craft and I am still your captain.Either way we have a duty of care to those girls.If not for the General, well do it for them.Avila stared at him, and eventually nodded, turning back to the controls, and Ferranti moved to sit down nearby, but not before patting Justus on his back as he walked away.Justus smiled weakly and moved himself, lifting Aramans blood covered body and placing it upon two connected seats in the centre of the craft.He looked so peaceful and still.Justus grasped one of the nearby towels and mopped the blood from Aramans face, before taking off his own coat and placing it over the young mans body.He sighed.Down among the Labyrinth the words of Xerin Kramer had been burrowing inside his mind, and it was only as he found the time to rest and breathe that what the Professor had said began to make some sense.He had always thought himself unusual.It had been one of the reasons hed ran away from home all those years ago.Kramer had thought Justus was the immortal leader of the Istrons.He had shot him because he feared the very thought that he might be, and then turned on Araman because of that very same fear.But it couldnt be true.He was Antal Justus, not Peter Marx.He had heard of the legendary leader of the Istrons: the most powerful of them all, immortal and mighty.But Araman was dead.If he was the immortal Peter Marx, how could he lie here before him, so battered and bloodied and helpless?There was something he was missing.Knowing what he now knew he only wished hed paid more attention to what Araman had said in their long discussions.If its true, Antal, if you are Peter Marx, you can deal with it later.Now is the time to make up for all you have done.Whether you survive or not.The shuttlecraft moved towards the lightning planet now.Justus stood and walked over to the cockpit.They were so close.But as he stepped up towards the front of the craft he noticed the cuffed Crilshan wrestle free of his restraints and reach for the lieutenants blaster.But Ferranti had seen it too.The Crilshan lifted Avilas blaster and pointed it at Ferranti, who lifted his own and aimed it at the dark eyed assassin.Gordian, he said.Dont.Here we are at last!Gordian, no!Avila cried.Quiet, he said.Youve been a good companion, Lieutenant.Companion?You have proven that your race has some quality.But this goes back further than you know.You have no idea the history we share, the battles weve fought, the scars weve left on each others flesh.And he turned to the Titanese captain.Did I not say what would happen the next time we faced off?Did I not tell you I would kill you once I wrapped my hands around this cold steel?Now whos the madman?Ferranti retorted.Oh, you know its always been me.I think thats the first ounce of truth Ive ever heard come from your mouth.Ha!Gordian laughed.Several rigid seconds passed by; and then, quite surprisingly, the Crilshan pointed the blaster up and raised his hands.Ferranti breathed out.Put it down.Gordian obeyed, dropping the weapon.His eerie eyes scanned all three of them, one by one.You need me, Diego, he said.But I will help you get Anna back.Ferranti kept his blaster closely trained upon his face.If you expect me to believe that  Captain, said Avila, I think we should listen to him.Thank you, Lieutenant.Quiet, Gordian, Ferranti snapped.Avila, do you think he will want nothing in return?Why dont you ask him?Gordian said.Fine.What do you want in return?Oh, just to be kept out of those awful cuffs.He smiled widely.They hurt like hell.Thats it?Avila asked.Nothing more?Gordian maintained his icy smirk.
