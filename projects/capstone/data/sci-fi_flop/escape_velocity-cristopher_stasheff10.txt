I do not confuse themI wish to make the fantasy become real!Think of it, Markoneyour barony become a reality, your vassals and serfs forever at your call!Markones eyes lost focus.A pleasant dream, Horatioyet nothing but a dream.It need not be!Horatio insisted.Think, man!What need would we have for all our fortunes?Each could lay the half of them away for his heirs here, and take the other half to pool, to buy a ship and equip an expedition!What could it cost?Certainly no more than a hundred billionand we must have a dozen barons in the Society who are worth more than half of that apiece!Markone gazed off into space.It might be possible, at that  as though we were holding an extended festival abroad And twould be possible to return  Meditate upon it, Horatio urged.Yet if twere done, twere well twere done quickly, Markone.You know the uncertainty of the political situation.You could almost hear Markones eyes click back into focus.Uncertainty?Whats doubtful about it, Bocello?Nothing but timeand that might be as short as a few days, before these petit bourgeois politicians in the Assembly elect the Executive Secretary to the noble post of Dictator!Oh, come now, Horatio purred.I scarcely think theyd be so blatant as to give him the title.No, but theyll give him the power!Theyre primed and ready; all they need is a trigger, some threat to all of them, and theyll cheerfully sell all their freedoms for securityand ours with theirs!True, trueand we know how sensitive these lowborns are to anything that threatens their positions.When alls said and done, money is secondary to them.But give them one sign that there may be someone more powerful than they, who might usurp their powers, and they panic!They do indeedwhich brings to mind the latest news, Horatio.Markone glowered up at him out of the screen.What think you of this Interstellar Telepathic Conspiracy?Who could better recognize a fantasy than we?But there is a man of almost supernatural gifts there, as the grain of truth that rumors wrapped around, Markone.Indeed?Markones scowl deepened.What manner of man is that?One youve metthe greatest bard of the Terran Sphere, Tod Tambourin.Government officials have been chasing him in here from the marchessecretly at first, but now openly, claiming that he and his band are telepaths.Chased Tod Tambourin?Markone bawled.This is too much, Bocello!They exceed excess in this!They do indeed.Horatio nodded slowly, eyes gleaming.If they will harry such a man out of pettiness and spite, what might they not attempt?By all the stars, Bocellodo you realize that they might come a hunting us?We are logical targets for envious men, Horatio purred, the more so since we have wealth to confiscate.Does it begin again, then?Must we watch the bloody flag arise, and ride on tumbrels to the guillotine?That, Dar thought, was overdoing it a bitthough he had to agree that there did seem to be some danger in staying on Terra just now, for anyone with large amounts of money or a taste for eccentric hobbies.I, for one, do not intend to learn the answer, Horatio informed his phone screen, at least, not from personal experience.Ill buy a ship alone, if I have to, and recruit my party guests.What say you, Markone?Will you join me?That I will, and see the Baronetcy of Ruddigore established in reality!Go buy your ship, Bocelloand dont lift off without me!The screen blanked.Horatio turned to his guests with a wolfish grin.So it begins, and theyll fall into line quickly, I assure you; the twelve great barons of the Central Kingdom.Oh, well have that ship bought and outfitted within a day, and be loading passengers in two!Whitey spread his hands.It was just an idea.You cant find enough people that fast, Dar stated flatly.Oh, maybe you twelve rich men might be ready to jump at a momentyou know you can come back any time you choose.But its different for the ordinary people.Theyll need a long time to decide.They will, eh?Horatio seized a stylus and tablet from his desk and strode to the French doors.He came out onto the terrace, hands high, bellowing, Now I cry HOLD!The shouting chaos of laughing and singing ceased in an instant.Theyre loyal, Horatio explained over his shoulder.Then, to the multitude: The Baronet of Ruddigore and I have decided to take ship, and ride out to the stars, to discover a world never before seen by Terrans, there to found the Central Kingdom in reality, and live as men ought, by faith and sweat and steel.We shall need villeins and yeomen, gentlemen and knights!We shall leave in two days time; any who are not with us then, will never be!Who wishes to ride?Sign here!He threw the tablet down into the multitude.With a roar, they pounced on it, and the whole crowd instantly re formed into a line, each one fairly panting in his eagerness to emigrate.Food sellers and jugglers began to work up and down the queue.Horatio turned back to Dar with a grin.That is the mettle of my people!Theyll change their minds by the time they get to the front of the line, Dar predicted.Horatio nodded.Some of them, no doubtbut most will sign.Theyve wished for nothing half so much as to live in a world where folk are true, and the rulers worthy of trust.How say you, brave ones?Will you join us?Instantly.Sam beamed up at him.Horatio looked down at her, surprised.Then, slowly, he began to smile, almost shyly.I admit Im tempted, Father Marco mused.For a priest, the Middle Ages had definite advantages.For gleemen, too.Whitey grinned from ear to ear.I think its a great idea, Horatio, and Ill cheer you on every A. U.  of the waybut I never was much of a joiner.Nor I.  Lona shook her head firmly.Stuck in a society thats never even heard of electrons?Horrible!Dar opened his mouth to answer, and a burring sound came out.He swallowed and blinked, then realized that the sound had come from the phone.A footman in tights and tabard stepped out to announce, There is a Mr.Stroganoff calling, sir, for Mr.Tambourin.Whitey looked up in surprise.Already?There shouldnt have been any progress yet.He went back inside, with Dar trailing after.Stroganoff was on the screen, dazed.Whats the matter, David?Whitey asked as he came into range.Oh, nothing, nothing at all!Everythings just finein fact, too fine.Thats whats the matter!Glad to hear itI hope.Want to tell me why its gotten so hot that its turned cold?The Executive Secretary.Stroganoff swallowed.I sent a fax to his office, right after you left.I figured the way the government bureaucracy works, Id better start right away if we were going to have any chance of shooting him within the year.Wise.Whitey was poised like a hawk about to stoop.And?And his office just called.Heshes willing to do the piece.But only if we can do it tomorrow!Whitey and Dar both stared.The primary citizen never says yes that quickly!Stroganoff bawled.And even after youve talked him into it, you have to make an appointment months away!And have it canceled at the last minute, at least twice.Whitey nodded, with a faraway look in his eyes.On the other hand, I do have a certain reputation  Well, youre at least as famous as he is, if thats what you mean.But   But my fame is apt to last a bit longer, Whitey mused, and from the current political news, Id guess the Exec isnt too sure hes going to still be Exec in a few monthsor even next month, for that matter.Next week, Stroganoff growled.Whitey nodded.So hes making his bid for immortality.Do the piece for us, and hes guaranteed a featured place in Tod Tambourins one and only 3DT masterpiece.Even if history forgets him, literature wont.Stroganoff nodded slowly.Yknow, that almost makes sense, Tod.Yeah, but the schedule doesnt.Whitey grimaced.Oh, the crew can make it easily enoughall we have to do is hop into a cab, and charge it to your company.Stroganoff shuddered.How about first class on a public shuttle?Whitey shrugged.Whatever you like.But how about equipment?May have it, or may not.Theres no point in dropping it down from Luna, of course; what we do is to rent it out from a dirt side company.I know a few.Ill have to make some calls, and get back to you.Whitey grinned.I always wanted to use a 3DT camera.Uh, hold on, now.Whoa!Stroganoff held up his palm.No can do, Tod.Cameras come with a union crew, or they dont come at all!Why?Whitey frowned.Ive got two electronics techs right here!I know, but if the union finds out youve shot a sequence without them, they wont give you any tech crew for the studio segments up here.Like it or not, weve got to use them.Okay, Ill try to like it, Whitey sighed.When do we meet them?Ill let you know, if I manage to get them.Wherell you be?Where should I be?Stroganoff grinned.Thank you, Meistersinger.Be on your way to the Gamelon, will you?Call me back when youre over Lake Champlain.11  Youre sure thiss the Gamelon?Dar muttered.For all I can see, it could be the inside of Moby Dick.Moby Dick was a whale, not a snake, Whitey muttered back, or havent you noticed how many turns weve made?Didnt look this big from outside, Dar grumped.Father Marco had become enmeshed in a long theological discussion with two young clerks who were devout atheists masquerading as medieval monks.Lona had become enmeshed in partying, and Sam was trying to become enmeshed with Horatio.So they had come alone to the long, striplike building that had replaced New Yorks eastside docks, and were following a lighted bar that slid along the hallway floor in front of them, making some very unpredictable turns as it led them farther and farther into the building that housed the Central Executive Staff of the Interstellar Dominion Electorates.Finally, it stopped next to an open doorway.Dar looked up, and met the gaze of a wide, very muscular individual dressed in a laborers coverall.Help you?he rumbled.Somebodys got to, Dar answered.Then Whitey arrived at his elbow.Tod Tambourin, he said, pointing to the ID tag the door guards had hung around his neck.Oh yeah, the writer.The muscular one looked bored.This your P. A. ?No, hes my assistant.Right.Well, come on in.Not much for you to do, though; were just about ready, here.They were, indeed.As Dar came in, he saw a huge desk sitting in front of a photomural of a starfield, with the I. D. E.  spiderweb superimposed over it in lines of light.On either side of the desk, between it and the backdrop, were two slender pillars.In front were two cameras.All around were at least a dozen technicians.Dar turned back to Muscles.Mind if I show my ignorance?Thats what Im here for, the beefy one sighed.What do you need so many people for?Easy.Muscles pointed.Two camera ops, one electrician, one engineer for each set of camera controls, one engineer for audio, one for the holo mole recorder, and a staging director.Thats only eight.Youre good at arithmetic.But therere at least sixteen here!Well, every positions gotta have a backup.You know, somebody might have a heart attack.Yeah, like the accountant who has to keep track of the budget for this show.What do you do?Im the shop steward.Oh  Uh, thanks.Dar turned away to Whitey.You sure we didnt stumble into a mattress factory by mistake?Whitey frowned.What do you mean?Theres so much featherbedding.In the far corner, a small man in a business coverall came through a narrow door.Rise, citizens, for your Executive Secretary.Those of the crew who were sitting (twelve, at the moment) hauled themselves to their feet.Oh, dont be ridiculous, Hiram!A tall man with white hair and a craggy, handsome face strode briskly in, the fabric of his modest coverall glowing with the quiet sheen of luxury.We dont stand on ceremony here.To prove it, he sat down at the desk.Dar swallowed around a sudden bulge in his throat.The Executive Secretary himself!Even out on a marches planet such as Wolmar, hed seen pictures of that face so often that virtually every wrinkle in it was embedded in his memory.To suddenly be in the same room with the man himself was unnerving; he didnt quite seem to be real.Youve come damn near a hundred light years to talk to this man, Whitey muttered in his ear.Go to it!Aloud, he said, Go check and see if hes got any problems with his lines.Dar swallowed thickly and stepped forward, holding the script before him like a shield.He hovered just behind the staging director, dimly aware that the lady was chatting with the Exec, but not at all sure what she was saying.Finally, the Exec nodded, and the staging director stepped back, calling to Dar, Ready any time.Are there  Dars voice broke into a squeak; he swallowed and licked his lips.The Exec glanced up at him in irritation.Dar cleared his throat and tried again.Any problems with the script, sir?He dropped his voice down just above a whisper and poured out the rest in a sudden rush: Boundbridge, Satrap, and Forcemain arent going to wait for an election.Theyve had a coup detat planned for months.I have the codes that will unlock the proof of their complicity.Save democracy, sir!A slow grin spread over the Execs face.Had that memorized, did you?Dar swallowed, and nodded.The Exec nodded, too, and rose, clapping Dar on the shoulder.Its always a pleasure to meet a genuine patriot.But his hand tightened, and he called out, Did you hook up those cameras?Yes, Mr.Secretary.The staging director looked frightened.Were patched into network.You can go live to all of Terra whenever you want.Good, good.The Exec let go of Dar just as harder hands laid hold of him.Looking up, he saw the shop steward and one of the assistants holding him, each one leveling a small but efficient looking pistol at his torso.Whitey was suffering the same treatment; and the whole crew, except for the camera operators and the staging director, had pistols out.All right, then.Put us on, the Exec said.He smiled into the camera in front of him, seeming suddenly warm and weary, but solemn.The staging director raised a hand, palm flat and stiff, gazing off into space, listening to a voice talking into his ear button.Suddenly his arm swung down like a sword, to point at the Exec.Fellow citizens, the Exec intoned, we are happy to be able to announce that we have arrested the vile telepath who has been stalking relentlessly through the planets, to Terra.He is here.The red light on his camera went off, and the corresponding light on the other camera glowed to lifepointing straight at Dar.With a sudden, horrible, sinking feeling, he realized everyone on Terra could see him.My Executive Guards caught him just in time, the Exec went on, right here, in this studio, attempting to assassinate me.A sudden horrible chill seized Dars intestines as he found a pistol in his hand.How ?Then, suddenly, he realized what the Exec was saying, realizing he was being identified as the horrible, vicious, telepathic assassin.He screamed, N o o o o!and threw his weight frantically against the hands that held him.They bit into his arms like steel clamps, and he writhed and twisted, bellowing in outrage, trying to shake them off.He knew what I was going to say next, the Exec said grimly, that the danger is not over.For he has confederates, fellow citizenstraveling unseen and unknown, here on Terra itself!Where these vicious assassins will next strike, we cannot tellnor who will be their next victim.Probably myselfbut it also might be any one of you.His voice deepened, ringing with conviction.They must be stopped!For you, my fellow citizens, do not have a corps of guardsmen to protect you day and night.They must be stoppedbut your Civil Police cannot arrest the people whom they know to be dangerous telepaths, because of the restrictions of civil rights laws!The only way to end this peril is to grant me full emergency powers, so that I can have your police clap these criminals into jails, where they belong.Today I will ask the Assembly for those powersbut I will not receive them without your support.Call your Elector now!Tell him to give me the powers I need to protect you!So that mad dog renegades, such as this one, can be banished to the farthest reaches of Terran space!He stared solemnly into the camera, the perfect image of a good but troubled man, until the red light went out.Then he thrust himself to his feet, grinning, and turned to Dar.Thank you, young man.You timed your struggling perfectly.Its you!Dar burst out.Youre the one who planned the coup!Nobut I will be the one who takes power.If theres going to be a dictator, I intend to make sure that Im it.You dont even care about saving democracy!Why so surprised?The Execs smile was gentle, sympatheticand underscored with contempt.You poor, nave idiot!Did you honestly think any politician really cared about anything but personal power anymore?Dar stared at him, horrified.Then the frustration broke, and the rage leaped through it.He threw himself at the Exec with a howl, fingers curving into clawsbut the guards hands held him back, and a cold spray hit his face, filling his head with fumes that spread darkness through his brain.12  WHY DID YOU ESCAPE FROM WOLMAR?The voice blasted through into Dars nice, warm nest of unconsciousness.An idiot monotone was singing in his right ear, and a cricket with absolutely no sense of rhythm was chirping into his left.HOW DID YOU LEAVE THE PLANET WOLMAR?I hopped into a courier ship, Dar answered truthfully.He levered his eyelids open, squinting against the light.Five of them, actuallyred, blue, green, yellow, and orangehitting him with stroboscopic flashes that didnt quite have a rhythmic patternbut it was a different nonrhythmic pattern than the crickets.Dar stared, dazzled.WHAT IS YOUR NAME?It was ridiculous, but he couldnt think of it.All he could think of was that he wanted someone to turn the lights off.I dont know!EXCELLENT, the unseen owner of the voice purred.WHICH OF YOUR TRAVELING COMPANIONS WAS THE TELEPATH?The what?DO NOT SEEK TO MISLEAD US!WE KNOW THAT AT LEAST ONE MEMBER OF YOUR GROUP WAS A TELEPATH.AND DO NOT TRY TO READ OUR MINDS; THE SENSORY DISTRACTIONS YOU ARE EXPERIENCING WILL PREVENT YOU FROM BEING ABLE TO CONCENTRATE SUFFICIENTLY FOR TELEPATHY!We hope, someone near the voice muttered.I cant read anybodys mind!SEE?the voice boomed to someone else.THE LIGHTS AND NOISES DO WORK!I never could read anybodys mind!Im not a telepath!The voice was quiet for a moment; then it boomed, WHEN WERE YOU LAST A TELEPATH?Never!Never, so help me!He could be lying, the voice muttered.Not with that sensory assault youve laid onto him, the other voice answered.Poor fellow cant even close his eyes now.I dont think he could concentrate enough to think up a lie.That was the other purpose of this system, the first voice admitted.Then it boomed out again: OUR AGENTS FOLLOWED YOU ALL THE WAY FROM WOLMAR TO TERRA, OF COURSE.HOW DID YOU FORCE TOD TAMBOURIN TO AID YOU?I didnt!I didnt force him at all!Then, suddenly realizing they might accuse Whitey, Dar added, I conned him!He is only a poet, the other voice murmured.Probably true.Besides, youd better get back to the main question before he goes catatonic on you.That sent a chill trickling down Dars spine.Right, the voice muttered; then, WHO IN YOUR GROUP WAS THE TELEPATH?There wasnt any!There arent any!There never have been any!WE KNOW BETTER, the voice said scornfully.WHO WAS IT?The flashing lights bit into his brain; the thousand hertz tone bored straight through from ear to ear, while the random clicks tripped up every thought that tried to flow.I cant think!Dar yelled.I cant think who it could possibly be!For the life of me!IT MAY BE JUST THAT.DO YOU REALLY EXPECT US TO BELIEVE ?The voice broke off in midsentence.WHOS THAT?GET HIM OUT OF HERE!My credentials, gentlemen.It was a fulsome voice, growing louder as it came closer.If you doubt them, you may verify me through the computer.Why?snorted the other voice.Theyre computer fed, anyway  Chief Torturer?To Mr.Horatio Bocello, yes.Hes just a billionaire, not a politician!Why would he need a torturer?Industrial espionage, mostly.INDUSTRIAL NUTHOUSE, the nearer voice snorted.HES ONE OF THOSE CRAZY BILLIONAIRES WHO DRESSES UP IN ARMOR AND TRIES TO PRETEND THE MIDDLE AGESRE STILL GOING ON.But we cant let some civilian come in here and   WHY NOT?MAYBE HES GOT JUST THE CAN OPENER WE NEED.TAKE OFF YOUR COAT AND GET TO WORK, MR.RICCI.Well, thank you, gentlemen.Wheres the coatrack?Ah, there.Now, which way to the vict  ah, subject?Ah, theres the door  Father Marco!Dar nearly yelped with joy at the thought of a familiar face.But he managed to hold it in; some wavering remnant of good sense remembered not to let the cat out of the bag.The priest drifted into view.Now, then, fellow!When did you stop being a telepath?When did I  never!Then you still are one!No, of course not!I never   When did you first become a telepath?Never, I tell you!Never.When did you begin to associate with telepaths?Never!Never!Hes being recalcitrant, Father Marco sighed, just as I feared.Well, get rid of these lights and noisesthey arent doing any good.BUT  BUT, MR.RICCI   Turn them off, I say!Theyre not getting any answers out of himand theyre driving me crazy!Turn them off!WELL  I HOPE YOU KNOW WHAT YOURE DOING.The lights and sounds died.Dar couldve wept with gratitude.Now, then!Lets try the old fashioned methods!Father Marco clapped his hands, and two giants shuffled into the light.Each was a head taller than Dar, and musclebound.You could tell, because they were both stripped to the waist.On top of that, they were shaven bald.And they both wore black masks.They unfastened the straps that held down Dars wrists, ankles, and chest, and yanked him to his feet.But  what  where  Dar sputtered.He had his answer in a second; they hustled him through the nearest doorway while Father Marco followed, calling, Thumbscrews!The Boot!The Iron Maiden!The Rack!They burst into the torture chamber, the two men rushing him so quickly that his feet scarcely had time to touch the floor.Grim, vicious looking instruments blurred past him, covered with cobwebs and rust.In the dim light, he could see that the stone blocks oozed drops of water.Then they burst through another door and twisted down an angling corridor.Wh  didnt I miss my stop, there?Nope, the black mask to his right answered.You aint even in your cab, yet.And sure enough, they burst through a final door, and there stood the pregnant teardrop shape of a cab, glistening in the muted light that filtered down to the underground cavern.No onell notice y here, the other muscleman growled.They scarcely still know it exists.He yanked open the door, and his mate booted Dar through it.But, the young man sputtered, what  why ?Because Horatio Bocello promised them berths on his spaceship, of course.Father Marco slid in beside Dar.They couldnt resist an offer like that.Course not, the second man agreed, sliding into the front seat.If anybodyd want to go back to the Middle Ages, itd be the torturers.You can say that quintuply, his mate agreed, clapping a chauffeurs cap onto his head.These namby pamby lights and noises and dripping waterfaugh!I wanna hear those bones crunch!His buddy clicked the hatch closed and advised him, You can stop acting now.Good.The first breathed a sigh of relief.But I do hate this job.Me, I cant even stand to set mousetraps!Just give me a chance to escape from this sick society!I did, Father Marco reminded him.You jumped at it.The cab swooped out of the shadows of the cavern into evening sunlight, up into clouds gilded by sunset and industrial waste.Dar looked around him, recognizing the plush upholstery and computerized bar.This is no cabits Bocellos limousine!I never woulda guessed it.The righthand torturer yanked off his mask.Pass me an akvavit, will ya?13  The cab dropped down and landed them on Bocellos back lawn, right next to an elongated dome big enough to have been a small spaceship.As Dar stepped out, Lona slammed into him with a hug that wouldve given a grizzly lumbago.Thank Heaven youre safe!We were so worried!Then she shoved back, holding him off at arms length, and he was amazed to see tears in her eyes.You poor, brave, dear idiot!Next time you have to go fling yourself on a sacrificial altar, do it for something worthwhile, okay?He couldnt spare the energy for an answer; he was too busy falling into her eyes.Apparently she had noticed his existence  Then Whitey was slapping him on the back, and Sam was craning up to plant a kiss on his cheek.I shouldve known the systemd swallow you up!He grinned back at her and squeezed her hand.Yeah, but you didnt let it chew me up and spit me out!No.Sam caught Horatios arm and beamed up at him.No, we didnt.Well, give some praise to the real heroes of the rescue, Horatio laughed, clapping Father Marco and one of the torturers on the shoulders.I only provided the car, and the code for getting into the Gamelon!Hurry and change, boysthe last shuttles lifting off in ten minutes.The torturers grinned and trotted away.Nobly done, Father, Whitey agreed.I dont know how you managed to bluff the real torturers.Father Marco shrugged.Nothing to it, when the computer said I was genuine.Yeah.Dar frowned.How did you manage that?My versatile granddaughter, Whitey sighed.Every time I despair of her because she cant make a sonnet, she does something like this.Oh, its nothing that big, Lona said, irritated.I just made a little addition to an existing program, thats all.Just a little addition that added Father Marcos name to a list of top security clearances, Whitey corrected.Dar stared.Howd she get past the security blocks?Trade secret, Lona said quickly, though I dont really see what all the fuss is about.I mean, computers may be fast, but theyre really not very bright, the dear little things.The two torturers came trotting back, dressed in plush overalls, and Horatio shooed them toward the dome.Aboard the yacht, now, quicklytimes wasting!If we dont move promptly, the Executive Secretary will be the Executive Dictator, and we wont be allowed to lift off from Terra!Hurry, hurrythe Brave New World awaits!He meant it literallythe Brave New World was the name the dozen plutocrats had given their newly purchased government surplus FTL spaceship.(In memory of Shakespeare, not Huxley).They saw it lying in the middle of Serenitatis Plain as they came in for a landing: a quarter of a mile long and eight hundred feet wide, glistening like a promise of the future.They landed near it and dropped down into an underground concourse with beige, textured walls and a burgundy carpet.Horatio hurried them along till the hallway widened into a circular bay with a double door in the far wall.A line of people in sturdy coveralls, with packs on their backs, was filing through it, to drift quickly upwards in a negative gravity field.Up there is the ship, Horatio explained.They should be almost done loading now.Are you sure you wont join us?Ill go.Sam beamed up at him.Anywhere you do.He smiled down at her tenderly.Thats very touching, my dear, especially since Im not taking my money with me.But really, I dont think youd be very happy, stuck in a primitive society with an old goat.Sounds delightful, Sam pronounced.Besides, Ill be a lords lady.In a very drafty castle, he reminded her, without central heating or air conditioning.Nor plumbing.Itll be very cold, sitting down in the garderobe on a winters morningand the wash basinll be frozen.Ill get used to it.No, you wont.In effect, you will cease to exist just before we make planetfall; we all will.Well sit down under a cerebral scan and have all memories of this technological nightmare of a culture erased from our brains.Then well have false memories implanted; each one of us has been developing a Society persona for years.On the trip outward, each one will record the imaginary memories of his persona; and after the brain wipe, those memories will be recorded back into our brains.You wont remember Sam; youll only remember Lady Loguire.Lady Loguire!Oh!Sam breathed, nestling up against him.It sounds wonderful.To oblivion with Sam; I never liked her much, anyway.I do, Horatio sighed, but I trust Ill love the Lady Loguire just as dearly.Well, then, sweeting, youre one of us, nowthe Romantic Emigrs; weve changed our name, effective upon our leaving the Solar system.Would anyone else like to join us?Lona was whispering into Father Marcos ear.He frowned, shaking his head, and whispered something back.She hissed another sentence at him, and his face broke into a wreath of smiles.He stepped forward, clasping Horatios hand.A delightful prospect!Ill come too, thank you!Horatios face lit up, but his tone was guarded.Are you sure, Father?I know youre a Cathodean, and that means youre either a scientist or an engineer.Youll have to have most of your memories erased too, at least the ones that have anything to do with technology.We dont want our new society to be contaminated by any link to this decadent, materialistic culture.Im a priest before Im an engineer, Father Marco assured him, and the priest agrees with you: materialism is a contaminant.Excuse me, said Lona.Gotta make a phone call.She swayed away to the nearest screen booth, at her most sultry.Dars eyes swiveled to follow her; he could almost feel them tugging at his sockets.Wonderful!Horatio clasped Father Marcos hand, grinning from ear to ear.At least our colony will have a real priest!How would you like to be an archbishop, Father?Thats not up to us, Im afraid.Father Marco smiled, amused.But I wouldnt mind being an abbot.As soon as we can build you a monastery, Horatio assured him.Still, I think we might manage a bishops miter for you; Ill beam the Pope as soon as we lift off.Father Marco frowned.Im afraid its not quite that easy to be allowed to talk with His Holiness.It is for me; we went to school together.Are you sure no one else would like to come?Dar shook his head.Thanks anyway, Mr.Bocello.Me, too, Whitey agreed.Im having too much fun in the present.But thanks for the offer, Cello.Lona came swaying back.Arent you forgetting Mr.Stroganoff?My lord!Dar cried, appalled.He was our producertheyll think he masterminded the whole scheme!Whatll they dotorture him, or kill him?Neither one, Horatio assured him, at least, not if my chauffeur is his usual, resourceful self.He was.They all swung about, to see Stroganoff puffing toward them down the concourse.Thanks for having me kidnapped, Mr.Bocello, he panted as he came huffing up.Probably saved my life.My pleasure, Horatio assured him.Im sorry to have been so unceremonious, but prompt action was required.Have you been briefed about our venture, Mr.Stroganoff?I certainly have, and I wish you all the luck in whatever world you find.Id love to go along if I could bring a 3DT camera and come backbut I understand you dont want any technology developed later than 1300.Except for full plate armor, yes.But are you certain, Mr.Stroganoff?You dont have much of a future left, here.Not on Terra or Luna, no, Stroganoff agreed.But I would like to stop by Wolmar for a few years; theres a man there Id like to chat with.Dar grinned.Horatio shrugged.Certainly.We dont much care where we exit from Terran space; one vectors as good as another.Youre sure I wont be taking you out of your way?Not at all, since we dont know where were going.And were doing our best to make certain nobody else does, either.Well change directions after we pass Wolmar; but we wont decide which new heading to take until after were out of communications range.This is going to be one lost colony that will stay lost.A man in uniform coveralls came running up to Horatio.Captains compliments, sir, and some newsright off the 3DT.The Assembly just voted the Executive Secretary full emergency powers, and the title Executive Director.An ominous ring to it, Horatio mused.I think wed better be lifting off while we still can.Farewell, good people!There was a quick round of hugs, handclasps, and kisses.Sam glared up at Dar with tears in her eyes.Goodbye, gnappie, and good luck!Dont let em get to you!Ill be kicking and screaming every centimeter of the way, Dar promised.What is a gnappie, anyway?Someone who just sits back and lives off his GNP share, without trying to accomplish anything.You wont be that, will you?Not if I can help it, Dar assured her.Then Horatio was whirling her away, whirling all three of them away, with an arm around Sam while he burbled to Father Marco, Im so glad you decided to come, Father!After all, what would the Middle Ages be, without monks and monasteries?They stepped into the lift tube, and Sam turned back to wave.Then the field bore them up, out of sight.Whitey clasped Dars shoulder.Up to the observation room, quickly!This is one lift off I want to be able to watch!They ran to a smaller lift shaft back down the concourse and flew up into the observation tower.It was a wide, circular space, with a thick carpet and thicker windows.In fact, it was nothing but windows, a full circle of them, and a transparent roof above.Dar looked around at the Lunar surface outside, a crazy quilt of brightness and blackness.Wonder why they didnt just build a clear dome?The usual reasonthis was cheaper.Whitey pointed at the huge sliver cigar a quarter of a mile away.Shes lifting, children.They stared, tracking it in silence, as the Brave New World lifted from the Lunar surface and drifted upward, away and away, shrinking from a monster that filled half the sky, to a splendid flying hill, diminishing and diminishing, to a silver cigar indeed, then a cigarillo, then a matchstick, then only a point of brightness.Suddenly that brightness intensified; it became an actinic spark, throwing a faint shadow of the three watchers onto the floor behind them, and began to slide away across the heavens.Exhaust, Lona whispered.Theyve ignited their interplanetary drive.The spark moved faster and faster until it was only a streak of light, shooting off toward the unseen orbit of Pluto, a miniature sun seeking a dawn.When it had dwindled to being only one more faint star in the millions that surrounded them, they turned away with a sigh.I hope they make it.Dar smiled sadly.I wonder if theyll really manage to set up their crackpot society.I have a notion they will, Whitey mused.When Horatio sets his mind to something, it gets done.Just hope theyll be happy, though.Me, too.Dar frowned.Especially Father Marco.How can he found a Cathodean monastery if he has his brain wiped of any engineering knowledge?Oh, I wouldnt worry about that, Lona murmured, with a quiet smile.Whitey fixed her with a jaundiced eye.Granddaughter, lick that cream off your whiskers and tell me who you phoned!Just the Brave New Worlds computer, Grandpait isnt hard to get the number, if you know what to say to Central Memory.No, not at allyou only had to talk your way past a few dozen of the Systems strongest security blocks first!Lona shrugged it off.Just basic logic.Yes, getting baser and baser as it goes along.And just what did you and the Brave New World have to say to each other?Oh, I just convinced it that Father Marcos the only one aboard who might stand even a remote chance of fixing it, if it ever broke down.It saw my point right away, and promised that, when it came time to wipe brains, it would skip Father Marcos.Whitey nodded, with a wry smile.I was wondering why he was suddenly eager to go.I could see a Cathodean being willing to leave civilization for the sake of the Churchbut technology is another matter.I thought they ought to be able to keep some link to reality, Lona agreed.And the only place they could do that, without it leaking out to the whole society, is inside the walls of a monastery.How pure and altruistic of you, Whitey muttered.Lona shrugged.I just have fun with computers, Grandpa.Well, enjoy it while you can, Whitey sighed.I have a notion our new lords and masters arent going to think too highly of funespecially your kind.Yeah, I hadnt thought about the future here.Dar frowned.Maybe Horatio and his buddies arent all that much crackpots.Things could get rather dull here, Lona agreed.Thats why, as long as I was on the phone, I got in touch with the Bank of Terras computer, Grandpa, and had all your funds transferred to the Bank of Maxima.A delighted grin spread across Whiteys face.How thoughtful of you, child!Dar frowned.Maxima?The place that built Fess?Hes says its just a barren piece of rock!With robot factories, Lona reminded him, which includes computer factories.And computer technicians and cybernetics experts, of coursemy kind of people.But I thought you wanted to participate in the life of decadence.I do, if I canbut if I have to choose between that and toying with circuits and programs, I know where the real fun lies.Besides, Maximas close to Terra; I might be able to come down for a spree, now and then.Then why transfer the money there?All of it?Because Maximas the one world that might be able to keep the central government from gimmicking its computers, Lona explained.That keeps the money intact, not to mention our privacy.Privacy?You think thatll be threatened?Dar turned to Whitey, frowning.You really think its going to get that bad here?Its called a police state, Whitey explained.Im sure they intend to include Maxima in it, tooin theory.But not in practice, Lona assured him.At least, not if I have anything to say to the Maxima computers.A chip off the old bloke, if ever there was one!Whitey grinned.Your mama wouldve said just the same.Well then, if Maximas where youre bound, wed better get started.He pulled out the recall unit and pressed a button.Should be here, pretty soon.He turned to Dar.How about you?Like to lift away from here?Yes, I would, thank youvery much.Thought so.You could go back to Wolmar, you know.The LORDS partys been saying for a long time that the frontier worlds cost too much, that we ought to just cut them off and leave em to their own devices.Might be some hard times coming out in the marches, but the worlds there should at least keep their freedom.Dar nodded.Id thought about that.In fact, Im pretty sure General Shacklarour governorhas had that in mind for a while, too.Also Myles Croft, on Falstaff.Well, I know Mys been getting strapped down and ready to go on his own, so I dont doubt your Shacklar has, too.But I take it youre not planning to go back there.Dar frowned.Howd you figure that out?Cause if you were, you wouldve hitched a ride with Horatio and gotten dropped off with Stroganoff.Whats the matter?Had a taste of the fleshpots, and decided to stay near em?Youve got me pegged, Dar admitted.Howd you guess?Believe it or not, I was young once, myself.The trick is, believing that he ever aged.Lona stepped a little closer to Dar, and it seemed to him that he could feel her presence as a physical pressure.And her eyes danced; she was watching him with a smile that was both secretive and amused.Where were you planning to go?Someplace, Dar pronounced, where Ill never have to hear about that Interstellar Telepathic Conspiracy again.Yeah, thats a masterstroke of confusion, isnt it?Whitey chuckled.I never saw a Big Lie work so wellit even has some of the liars convinced!I love watching a fantasy go out of control.Oh, it isnt total fantasy, Dar mused.Theres a grain of substance to it.Whitey gave him a sidelong glance.You sure about that?Well, it kinda makes sense, doesnt it?Dar spread his hands.With all that fuss and bother, there shouldve been at least one real telepath at the bottom of it all.Shouldve, maybe.Lona gave him her most skeptical look.Wouldves another matter.When it comes to telepathy, if it doesnt have integrated circuits, I wont believe in it.Just telepaths?Dar gave her the skeptical look back.I wouldve said that was how you looked at everything.Theres some truth to that, Lona admitted.I dont have too much use for dreams, unless someones trying to make them come true.Telepathy as a dream, now, I can see thatif someones trying to invent a way to make it happen.Or faster than light radio, or maybe even rearranging the bonds in a single molecule, to make it into a complete electronic circuit.Dars skeptical look turned into a fish eye.Thats your idea of a dream?Well, the only ones that Id talk about in public.She had the amused, secretive look back, and her eyes transfixed him.Dont you have any?Dar frowned, and his gaze drifted away, out toward the stark, cruel sharpness of the lunar plain.No  Im a little low on them, right now.Ill settle for getting away from Terra while I can.A bulbous, pitted, teardrop fell from the starfield and drifted down, settling over the boarding tube the Brave New World had used.Sensing a ship, it lifted and quested, homing automatically on the airlock, probing and touching tentatively, then locking tight.Fesss here, Whitey announced.Lets go get safe, younglings.They stepped into the drop tube and came out into the concourse.No one talked as they walked the quarter mile to the gate; each was wrapped in his own thoughts, realizing that he or she was leaving Terra forever.Though Lona was making plans about how to be able to come back for visits, safely; that was her only real concern with the planet.Shed been raised between the stars, after all; to her, Mother Earth had always been only an extravagant relative, to visit when you wanted a treat.Dar had never been to Terra before, and didnt particularly care to visit again; but Whitey had been born and reared on Manhome.Memories were here, many of them; but for him, now, the triune goddess had shifted; Hecate had ceased to be either mother or lover, and had become the murderess.If he came back to her arms, he would die.The children didnt know that, because they didnt know what he was planning to do; but he did.They stepped into the gates lift tube, and drifted up through the airlock, into Fesss familiar frayed interior.Ah, home, Whitey sighed, or what passes for it these days Fess, get me a shot of real Scotch, will you?Id like it to go with the view as we leave.Certainly, Mr.Tambourin.Lona?Dar?Vermouth would be nice, right now, Dar mused.Water, Lona said firmly, at least, until were on our way.She dropped into her acceleration couch and webbed herself in.Dar sank down on the couch next to hers.The bar chimed softly, and he popped back up to fetch the drinks.No, stay put, Whitey.The bard settled back down into the couch behind Dars with a grateful sigh.He stretched the webbing across his body and locked it in, then accepted the shot glass from Dar absentmindedly as he gazed at the viewscreen and its image of Terra, huge against the stars.What course shall I set?Fess asked softly.Moment of decision, Lona said to Dar.Where do you want to go?Dar looked deeply into her eyes.She held his gaze, hers unwavering.Her pupils seemed to grow larger, larger  Wherever youre going, Dar said softly.She sat still, very still.Then she said, Are you sure?Yes, Dar said, very.Then they were still again, gazes locked.Whitey cleared his throat and said, a little too loudly, Well, you know how it is, Fesswhen youre young, and all that.There are references to it in my data banks, the voice agreed.You go off to your own little dream world, Whitey explained, even though you think youre staying in the real one.You get wrapped up in romance for a while, and you dont really relate all that well to whats going on around you.Similar to an artificially induced alteration in consciousness?Well, thats what the drugs are trying to imitate, yeahbut you know how much an imitations worth.Still, when they do get involved in the real thing, theyre out of touch for a while, and its up to us old folk to hold things together till they come out of their trances.How do you intend to hold things together, Mr.Tambourin?Oh, just bumming around the Terran Sphere for a while, drifting and roaming, same as Ive always done, singing innocent, apolitical songsand gradually working my way out to Wolmar.Wolmar?But why?Oh, to see Stroganoff again, I supposeand this Cholly that Dars so enthusiastic about.Seems as though they might have some good ideas.I couldnt do it the easy way, though, hitching a ride with Horatio.I mean, Ive got some responsibilities.Gotta see these two young folk settled and safe before I can go kiyoodling off.And at the rate theyre going now, its going to take them a long time   I thought you were in love with Sam, Lona finally said.Dar shook his head.Not a bitat least, not after you came along.She was a good ally, when things got tensebut a lover?No.I couldnt get interested.Oh?Lona said, dryly.Why not?Because, Dar said, I just wouldnt be able to make love to someone who was reading my mind.Lona sat very still for a few seconds.Then she said, Sam?The real, live telepath at the bottom of the whole scare?The correlations are rather obvious, Fesss voice murmured, if all youve told me is accurate.Her knowing exactly where to find the credentials in the luggage of Bhelabhers staff, her ability to open a strange combination lock, to lead Dar through the dark maze of the criminals dungeon on Falstaff, her emotional reactions to the witch hunt What is surprising is that none of us realized it sooner.And that Fess knew all the facts.Lona eyed Dar suspiciously.Didnt know you two had gotten so chummy.Hes a very sympathetic listener, Dar said brightly.But nobody told him to correlate for the identity of a possible telepath.The suspicious gaze turned calculating.When did you realize it?Right after Father Marco pulled me out of that interrogation.I realized that the flashing lights and noises were an awful lot of trouble to go to if they werent really afraid of having their minds readso they really believed there was a telepath, and it had to have been one of our crew.Then I remembered seeing suspicious, hostile Sam falling head over heels in love with Horatio Bocello on a moments notice.It just wasnt like her.She had to be seeing something in him that the rest of us didnt seeand there was only one way she couldve done that.By peering into his mind.Lona pursed her lips, nodding.Well, love at first second sight, I can see.The Executive Director, however, does not realize that you are not the telepath, Fess pointed out.He will no doubt be hunting you for the rest of his lifeand his successor after him.A telepath would make an invaluable aide for a dictator.Yeah, I was thinking about that.But I think, if I find some out of the way place and live quietly, Ill probably be pretty safe.Of course, Ill have to take a few standard precautions, such as changing my name   To what would you change it?Oh, nothing too elaborate; Im kinda tired just now.Dar sighed, leaning back in his couch.Just taking my real name and making a few changesyou know, dArmand instead of Dar Mandra, that sort of thing.He turned to Lona.You ought to think about thatyoure on their list, too.Yes, she said, eyes glowing, I know.Interested in changing your name?Yes, I think I will, she said,  dArmand sounds good to me, too.
