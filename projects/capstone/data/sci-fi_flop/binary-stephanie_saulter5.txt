Aryel was shaking her head.And what if her partners genetype complicated things further?Suppose he was a gillung, for example?And they risked having a child in whom gill tissue might overwhelm lung tissue?Or vice versa?Do we want to have to tell people in that position that their kids can only be healthy if they are as unlike their parents as possible?We dont, said Sharon, with conviction.She felt Mikal shift beside her.I just didnt realize it was possible to deal with problems that complicated.Oh, its possible.The gemtechs have the technology, but no incentive to use it.The government hasnt made up its mind whether to buy it, and we cant afford to, not for a while yet.Public policy is moving too slowly, some of the Reversionists are proving too influential.We need a solution, and we need it quickly.Sharon chewed at her lip.How long does this intervention go on for, though?If your self regenerating water breather grows up and has kids with a high altitude hyperspectral hybrid, say...and then their kids...Exactly.Either we do what the hard core Reversionists want, letting our abilities die outor not reproducing at allor we face the fact that the legacy of gemtech is going to be with us for generations, and we need an equally long term strategy for dealing with it.She shrugged.Im not certain this is it.BelNatur may not really be reformed, or reformable.But if they are, its the quickest, simplest solution I can see.Sharon turned this over.Aryels reasoning, as always, made sense.But she could also see the implications, far reaching and transformative, as engineered anatomies combined into new forms, and supernormal abilities became diffused throughout the human gene pool.There was a part of her that understood the concerns, the hesitation, the outright fear that fueled the Reversionists, as well as many more who would not wish to bear that label.She flipped them an ironic mental salute, and moved on.Her own choice in such matters had been made long ago.Is Jora seeing a gillung?Just curious.Aryel laughed.Joras not seeing anyone, as far as I know.Shes only just stopped carrying a torch for Callan, poor girl.But shes only twenty; as long as they harvest her regularly shell probably outlive us all.Its bound to come up at some point.Eli went through his lists again, carefully, thinking that if Aryel really was going to seal the deal that afternoon there would be little chance in the future to fix any mistakes.He had brainstormed exhaustively with her and Callan and Herran, trying to imagine all the possible scenarios, all the protections and guarantees they would need.A reminder began to pulse in the corner of his tablet, but he ignored it for a few minutes, until he was certain that everything was in order.Then he tapped open a vidpanel that he could monitor while he composed a cover message to Aryel.The interview was being streamed live, but not from the usual chic studio whose ever changing dcor was endlessly imitated by the legions of the hip.Eli recognized the comfortable interior of a decidedly more well worn club near the Squats.Ill be damned She got them to come to her The most popular street culture host on the trendiest socialstream sounded even more starstruck than usual.Eli had for years made a practice of keeping an eye on even the silliest of the streams, having learned too well that that was where changes in moods and attitudes would manifest first.This one was both reasonably intelligent and hugely influential; whatever it touted today was likely to be on everyones lips tomorrow, and ubiquitous by the end of the week.They had just about given up begging Aryel to be a guest, although that might be about to change.The host, a waif thin norm who was known, among other things, for only using his first name, was in full flow....she shares with her even more famous foster sister another thing thats rare for gems: a surname.Do you prefer Ms.Morgan?No, said Gwen.Just Gwen.She flashed a smile at him.Even through the tiny square of the vidpanel, Eli felt dazzled.It appeared to stun her interviewer as well.Right.Beautiful, he mumbled, then recovering himself, thats beautiful.Well, Im not sure its fair to call this your debut performance, Gwen.Many of us had the pleasure of hearing you sing at the Festival opening a few days ago...Oh, please.She was charmingly dismissive.That was an improvised response to an unpleasant situation.Not my usual thing at all!Well, you certainly made it pleasant for the rest of us!And you knew a song that was very old and obscure.I think we all found that quite remarkable.Did you learn religious music because of your upbringing?I just learned music, Gwen replied.She was leaning casually against the vacant bar, elbows propped and long legs crossed, shimmering ruby curls cascading over her shoulders.Her outfit was not old fashioned, but neither was it the current rage; there was an ahead of the curve glamour about it that Eli suspected a thousand young women would immediately attempt to replicate.It was unlikely to look as good on any of them as it did on her.Many old things survive out in the mountains.It doesnt mean we think about them the same way our ancestors did.I understand there are a lot of traditional sounds in the work youre going to be showcasing for us tonight.But the songs themselves are new, is that right?Thats right.Almost everything well be playing has only ever been heard in rehearsal.And the traditional sounds are not just from one tradition.Lyriam and I are interested in pulling together lots of different influences...ah, here he is.Another radiant smile as Lyriam walked into the frame, leaned across to shake the interviewers hand, and then propped himself on the bar beside her.It sounds like a real meeting of the minds, the host prattled on.But I understand youve only recently started collaborating?Tell us about that.Eli concentrated on finishing his message while Lyriam and Gwen tag teamed the rest of the interview.P. S. , he wrote at the end, Im watching UnStreamed, and your sister is playing Julius like a violin.He swiped to send and turned his full attention back to the vidpanel, just as Julius turned his full attention back to Gwen.So, Gwen, I guess we wont be hearing any more hymns from you tonight, then.Any thoughts on the Reversionist reaction to your, ah, improvised response?He was grinning toothily.I understand there was speculation about whether you might have some sympathy for them.Because of your background.I have a lot of sympathy for anyone who has a hard time working out where they fit in, Gwen replied sweetly.The Remnants know how important it is to learn from the past, but I think there are many people who dont understandsadlythat thats not the same thing as imitating it.Not at all.Were very clear that the biggest lesson is often what not to do.Julius looked slightly stupefied.Lyriam threw Gwen a sideways glance: appraising, and possibly a touch apprehensive.She leaned against the bar, held Julius with her eyes, and serenely waited for the next question.He stammered out something about whether that was part of her approach to music as well, but Eli was not listening to the answer.That reply went well beyond the shows arts and lifestyle remit and he felt a sense of wry admiration for how neatly Gwen had just dismissed the Reversionists and instead placed herself at the center of the cultural zeitgeist.But more: It took him back to the night in the park, Reginalds cryptic comment, the sense of a shifting landscape that he had felt at the party.He looked down at the tablet in his hands, the plans and protocols he had been working on, the message he had just sent, and thought about the use to which all of that work was about to be put.Reginalds right, he thought.Integration isnt going to be a problem, and the Reversionists dont stand a chance.They will be us before we know it.Zavcka Klist hated the smell of the lab.She considered it one of the many ironic annoyances of her life that even after the overthrow of all but the most mundane gemtech, the upheavals that had occurred with and without her assistance, the fulfilling of her own ambitions still required her to spend far too much time breathing in the miasma of organic matter and electrolysis, the sweet stink of solvents and waste.She would have liked to come down here less, but she knew too well the dangers of hands off management; of allowing staff members to become isolated, or, worse yet, to believe themselves inviolate.And developments were at such a delicate stage.Once I get through this part, once I know for sure its going to work, Im taking a break.No special security, no sixteen hour workdays, no fucking labs.She kept her distaste firmly masked through the few final words of approval and encouragement, and stepped into the elevator beside Dunmore.The doors hissed closed, and she breathed a sigh of relief.His face was as stoic as ever, but there was a hint of curiosity in his voice as he said, Everything to your satisfaction, maam?Theyre doing very well.Very well indeed.But this deal with the gems is going to happen, Dunmore, and that means the safeguards need to be especially tight.Shift patterns, communications, everything.They need to understand below stairs that nothing, and I mean nothing, can be allowed to slip.It wont, maam.Ill be drilling them personally.He cleared his throat.Do we know when the gems are likely to arrive?Within a couple of weeks, I hope.Theres no time to waste.Im aiming to wrap up the business end of it today, god help me, and then itll be as soon as the savant can be persuaded to start.He cocked his head at her.It was as close to a look of reproof as she had ever seen from Dunmore.She looked back, puzzled, and then got it.As soon as Herran can be persuaded to start.Damn.Youd better drill me too.If you like, maam, but it wont be necessary.Once theyre on site youll be sharp.I need to be sharp now.Set an example.He ducked his head, a fractional movement that conveyed acknowledgment, agreement, and approval, but no less deference.Dunmore was a marvel, she thought, a type one hardly ever saw anymore.He rarely betrayed an opinion of his own, never balked at anything he was required to do, but he was the sort of servant who would tell you what you needed to know whether you liked it or not, without any diminution of respect.He could be relied upon to read the mood on the streets and streams, and to understand how well it correspondedor notwith the once hermetic bubble of BelNatur.Though he had neither education nor brilliance, was as stolid and unoriginal as a coffee cup, it was he who really understood how to close the circuit between the requirements of her personal project and the realities on the ground.How very different from Khan, waiting upstairs for her with notes and calculations for the final horse trade with Temple and Morningstar.He too had his finger on the pulse of current opinion, but that was because he shared it, he lived it.He was full of creativity and initiative, and enthusiasm for this new, borderless world.She could hold him in her minds eye as an example, an embodiment of the modern spirit; a marker of how far she had yet to go.The new and the old, the cavalier and the cautious, the carrot and the stick.You are a lucky woman, Zavcka, in spite of everything.What you need is at hand when you need it.These two are counterweights; repellent to each other, but equally necessary to your survival.Keep them loyal, use them wisely, and they will get you through this.Binary       15 The club was larger than Rhys had expected, tucked away behind a deceptively modest entrance on one of the still shabby streets that ringed the Squats.They had barely arrived before Gwen dragged him through a door next to the bathrooms and showed him around a maze of narrow passages and odd little offices and storerooms that she rather grandly referred to as backstage.He stuck his head into the noisy chaos of a dressing room to wave at Lyriam and the rest of the band before he and his sister emerged back onto the dance floor through a different door, this time beside the bar.Music poured down from hidden speakers, pressing against him like an insistent hand.It sounded Antipodean, at once archaic and oddly modern, a bone deep bass thrum behind a high, wavering voice that flickered through the notes almost too fast to register.He heard Gwen begin to hum a counterpoint, the subvocal harmonics below the level of most peoples perception.She probably didnt even know she was doing it.The dance floor was a semicircle of clear space in front of a small stage, now bustling with activity as instruments were positioned and equipment checked.It was bordered by seating and low tables, and then there were a couple of steps up to another level, with good views to the front and dark, discreet alcoves further back.Enough to hold a lot of people, even if those who chose the seats at the rear would likely be more interested in each other than in the performance.But still, it was an impressive space, and it needed to be.With Lyriam as costar, the showannounced via the breaking news bombshell of the mornings joint interview, and with the additional cachet of being invitation onlyhad within a few hours become the hottest ticket in town.Barely a week had gone by since the concert in the park, and Rhys mentally calculated the degree of hard graft, subtle persuasion, and calling in of favors that must have gone into organizing it, and concluded that Gwen had been up to much, much more than even he had realized.Reginald, Graca, and Aryel had commandeered a section of plush banquettes on the lower level, close to the stage.Rhys and Gwen made their way over, against the steady trickle of people heading for the bar.Most of the tables, he noticed, were already occupied; the room had begun to fill up just in the few minutes that they had been away.About half the audience for this pop up performance bore obvious gemsigns, and glowing, jewel colored heads made their own light show as they nodded and tossed around him.Many of them called out to Gwen, familiar greetings that she laughingly returned.Despite himself, Rhys had to admit he was impressed.When had she found time to meet them all?Gwen had always been better at making friends; she had the gift of instant charm and effortless popularity, where he generally felt himself having to work at it.But this was remarkable even by her standards.She slipped seamlessly into the conversation the others were having with a pair of new arrivals who leaned over the railing from above.They said their goodbyes and hurried off to find seats, only to be replaced by others.For several minutes there was a constant flow of people stopping to greet Ari, comment on Gwens UnStreamed appearance and wish her luck with the show, shake Das hand, and compliment Graca on the subaquatic technology that was emerging as one of the big stories of the Festival.Rhys smiled and nodded just enough not to appear rude, while he kept an eye on those still arriving.He spotted Callan as he emerged out of the dim passageway that led to the entrance, and paused to survey the room.Rhys raised a hand, and felt his heart skip as he saw Callans face light up.He made his way over, arriving just as the last lot of well wishers were about to depart.Twice in one week!exclaimed the tall albino woman, Aster, as she planted a kiss on both Callans cheeks.Her skin and hair were bone white, but her eyes glowed pale purple around piercing violet irises.We might almost get used to seeing you.Be careful what you wish for, he shot back, and there was laughter, a final round of hugs, and then she threaded her imperious way toward the bar.Her departure seemed to signal the end of the flurry that had surrounded them, and they were finally able to sit.Rhys knew that if his family had not been there Callan would have greeted him with a kiss, wrapped an arm around him as they sat next to each other.Instead he could feel him staying within touching distance but not touching, watching him sideways, waiting to see how he wanted to play it.He shot him a glance back, read the wanting in his eyes, and felt his stomach flip over again as he shifted close enough to clasp his hand for a moment and lean casually against him, thigh to thigh.There was a quick, delighted smile in response, a squeeze of his fingers, and a happy glint in the green eyes.Rhys looked back at his family.Aryel, sitting across from them on a toadstool like ottoman, arched an eyebrow, shook her wings, and smiled.Reginald said, Hmm!and grinned broadly, and Graca chuckled.Gwen stared open mouthed, blinked, swallowed, and said, Callan?Would you mind if I borrowed my brother for a moment?Callan looked as though he were considering.Any particular reason?He needs to be slapped.In that case, absolutely not.What for?Rhys, indignant.For not talking to me.How did I miss this?You, said Rhys loftily, have not been paying attention.I always pay attention!Apparently not.You have been a bit distracted, Gwen, Aryel observed with amusement.Preoccupied, Id say, Reginald added.Sidetracked, even, chimed Graca.You are all as mad as each other.And you, brother dear, have been keeping secrets.She sat up straight, scowled prettily at him and drummed her hands on the table as if to emphasize that this was the final word on the matter.Rhys snorted.If Iwewere, we wouldnt have been the only ones.He made a show of looking pointedly around the room and was pleased to see her grin turn a bit sheepish.We ell...Lyriam thought it would be better not to tease it too far in advance...if we hadnt been ready in time, its easier to cancel something nobody knows about.And I couldnt argue with that, Im the one who doesnt really know what shes doing.She batted her eyelashes modestly as everyone except Callan howled.He looked questioningly at Rhys, who stopped laughing long enough to lean over and say in a stage whisper, She always knows what shes doing.Almost always.Gwen was still tapping her hands against the table, a faint percussive rhythm that Rhys registered as a nursery song from their childhood.The publicity boost from the interview was massive, but it means weve got even more stream coverage than we expected.I dont want to let anybody down.Her gaze paused for a moment on the door by the bar, and then she smiled at them as the reassurances poured in.Right, well.If Im going to live up to all of this, Id better go get ready.Callan, as she got to her feet, Rhys is an ass, but thats no reflection on you.She shot him an even sweeter smile, stuck her tongue out at her brother, and turned to go.Reginald heaved himself to his feet.I shall escort you, he said gravely, as far as the bar.Ill help, said Graca, and they collected orders and headed for the crowd that surrounded it.As soon as they were gone Aryel leaned forward, her face turned serious.Cal?How did it go?Fine.No worries at all.It was obvious Herran had no idea what they were talking about.He was as baffled as Ive ever seen him.Was he upset?Not really.I mean, you know Herran.He really likes Sharon.He was apologetic.He glanced at Rhys.Sorry not help.What about the other cop?Police psychologist.Had already liaised with social services, apparently, and read Herrans file.Really?Relief washed over her face.Oh, well done, Sharon.I should have known not to worry.Whats this?asked Rhys, and Aryel explained.A psychologist would be able to make an informed judgment about Herrans mental state, far more than just a regular cop.And its part of Herrans profile that he doesnt lie.There are things he might keep to himself, or find ways to talk around, but he cant actually tell an untruth.Or break a promise.He cant?This struck Rhys as almost more amazing than any of the things he knew Herran could do.I mean, thats good, I suppose, but...He stopped, trying to work through his sense of ambivalence.Its a basic human capacity, Callan said quietly.He sounded sad, and under the table his fingers tightened again around Rhyss where they rested on his knee.To be able to make things up, invent a different version of events, justify breaking your word.Herran cant do it.Rhys swallowed.I thought, when we were with him the other day...I mean, the way his brain works is incredible.I was awestruck.And its not like I think people should lie.But not to be able to...He keeps things to himself, Aryel said again.And hes gained a little...subtlety, I guess you could call it.But sophisticated lateral thinking, leaps of logic, intuition...She shook her head.He just doesnt seem to have the wiring for it.That observational analysis you and Gwen do automatically?Way beyond him.Thats really why youre sending Callan and Dr.Walker to BelNatur with him, isnt it?Its not just to help him communicate and feel comfortable.Youre afraid they might take advantage of him in ways he doesnt understand.That is a big part of it.She smiled at him.See?Sophisticated lateral thinking.Inference.You just spotted the connections.I wonder...She trailed off, pensive.She was flickering through moods this evening, Rhys thought, the way the aborigem singer had been flickering through notes.It was unlike her.Callan, dyou know if Elis coming?A little later, I think.Said he had a few things to finish off.He gave her an appraising look.It is going to happen, isnt it?BelNatur?Yes.We got everything we wanted today.Callan pursed his lips and nodded, with the air of a man receiving orders to deploy to the front lines.Are you really okay with going there?Rhys asked him softly.Okay might be a bit strong.But theres a lot at stake, and the neurologist who came to meet Herran seemed really decent.He wasnt put off by her, which I confess is what I thought would happen.So Imcalm about it, lets put it that way.I think calm is about the best any of us can manage when it comes to BelNatur, Aryel put in.And more than some of us are managing, when it comes to other things.Gwen, for example, could do with being a bit less spiky.I thought she was pretty confident, Callan remarked, despite what she said.She was great on UnStreamed this morning.Oh shes completely confident about the show, and the interview was never going to be a problem for her.But she went pretty far over the top with you two.She was embarrassed, Rhys said immediately.She doesnt like being caught unawares.Surprise flitted across Callans face and Rhys felt embarrassed himself, as if he were making excuses.I mean yes, she was over the top.Did you mind very much?Its just, I know what shes like.He stopped, because Callan was laughing.No, I didnt mind very much.And I think its sweet that you defend her even when shes the one giving you a hard time.And, his smile took in Aryel now, chuckling softly across the table, I suspect that if anyone else so much as gave you a dirty look she would crack them open like a nut.So shes okay in my book.You realize, Aryel put in, that potentially that includes you.She chortled at Rhyss horrified face.Oh yes.I recognized the warning shot being fired across my bow, said Callan serenely.His hand emerged from under the table and snaked around Rhyss shoulders.No fear.Ill do nothing to deserve it.Much later that night, after the ovations and congratulations were over, the streams had been sent into further paroxysms of excitement with exclusive clips and insider reviews, and most of the crowd had gone home, Gwen cornered him on the upper tier of the club.Does he know?Yes.Does he know really, Rhys?Ive told him.He felt his gorge begin to rise at the look she gave him, as though questioning whether he really had, or really should have, done as hed said.Look, what do you expect?That I would let someone get close to me, start a relationship, without telling them what they might be in for?The worry on her face was clear now, although she pursed her lips and tried to affect an air of carelessness.It doesnt need to be a relationship.It does and it is.Hes not just some boy, Gwennie.Hes...Ive never...this is different.She stared at him without expression for a long moment.Across the room he could see Callan deep in conversation with Aryel and Eli; somewhere in the dimness behind him he could sense a few other stragglers who would probably have to be levered out of whatever amorous tangle had kept them through the various last calls and general bustle of departure.Graca and Da were nursing final drinks with Lyriam and the blue haired, narrow faced agent, staff members were upturning chairs onto tables and wiping down the bar.Not for the first time it occurred to him that Bethany had not been seen all night.Rhys.Gwen spoke quietly, and with a deadly seriousness.Does he really, really understand what happens to you?None of us really understands what happens to me.Her eyes bored into him, overturned his attempt to be glib, and he sighed.He hasnt seen how I get.When he does, if he does, he might run a mile.He might not want He broke off, feeling the uncertainty wash up in him for the first time in days, the fear that he might be doing wrong, for himself and others.This time he could not help but think also of what too much caution might cost him.He watched the line of Callans throat moving as he spoke to Eli, the lazy curve of his smile and the way he tilted his head to listen to Ari.Nascent desire transmuted, sparking into anger at his sister.What do you want me to do, Gwen?Never be with anyone again?Only ever be close to you, and Da, and Ari?Turn myself into an outcast just in case Im with someone and I take a bad turn and they freak out?He could feel his shoulders tensing, and a warning whispered in the back of his brain.He shook his head sharply, drew a deep breath.I cant live like that.I thought maybe I could, but I cant.Callan says he can deal with it, and I have to believe him.Gwen took a step back, hands up for calm, and he realized his voice had risen a little.He saw Graca turn her head in their direction, and kicked himself as he remembered how sharp gillung hearing was.Callan glanced over at them, still smiling, unaware, and turned back to Aryel.Ki, Gwen said softly.Rno sah.Okay.Dont get upset.Sorry, he muttered.But look, Da and Ari arent bothered, so I dont know why you should be.Maybe...she murmured.No, youre right.You have to live your life regardless.I want you to be happy, Rhys, you know I do.I just worry.Stop worrying.Im fine, hes fine, were fine.I start the tests tomorrow, theyll work out whats wrong, do some gene surgery and fix it.Ill probably never have another attack again.I hope so.For all our sakes.She was watching Callan too now.Hes wonderful, and I can see how good he is for you.You would never, ever want to hurt him.Binary        Questions She wants to know how old she is.It is a new obsession, one that seemed to arrive along with the tender bumps on her chest, the tufts of feathers on her wings and clumps of hair elsewhere.She has charted the course of her life as far back as she can, has already calculated minimums and maximums from what she can remember and what she has been able to pull off the datastream.But her tablet access remains clandestine, limited by firewalls she dare not breach, and in any case she suspects the most she would find would be batch cultivation and implantation data, fetal and postnatal development charts.That is not what she wants.Why do you care?Everybody else knows their birthday, she says.I just want to know mine.I dont want a cake or anything.She can still hear the sounds of celebration, faint now behind the closed door of Dr.Panborns office.Someone must have seen her approaching along the corridor, but shed smelled strange foods and glimpsed red faces over half full glasses before the door was shut firmly against any closer inspection.She had lingered outside, knowing that Dr.Owen would slip out early and find her there.Everybody else does not, he tells her, ignoring the comment about cake.We do.Gems dont have birthdays.She can see crumbs on his lapel.She wonders what they taste like.Why not?You dont need them.Why do you need them, then?For a moment he appears nonplussed.She is having this effect on him a lot lately.The habit of caution is as strong in her as ever, and she keeps her eyes downcast and her face as blank as she can manage.Still, she is faintly surprised that she continues to fool him.Its not a question of why.We just have them.Were made differently.But everybody gets born.Thats just a regular thing that happens to everybody.You are not a regular person, Aryel, and you never will be.These things are not important for you.Now, and he glances ostentatiously at the screen of his tablet, something else he has taken to doing when she perturbs him, you have no business wandering about at this hour.Go back to the dorm.You can play with your tablet for a while before you go to bed, if you like.And he walks away, flushed with his own magnanimity, and leaves her trembling with rage and hurt.One day, Dr.Owen, she thinks.One day it might be important for you.Binary       16 It occurred to me last night, Aryel was saying.You said you hadnt been able to work out what was so special about the genestock they took?No.They were older lines, from several different gemtechs.Sharon wondered why they were going over this again.Her earset had pinged as she was heading out the door, Aryels mellow tones asking if she had a moment to pop up to the roof.Ive had a thought, shed said.Something that might help.It was taking her a while to get to it, though.Didnt that strike you as odd?Aryel, this whole fucking business strikes me as odd.Aryel laughed shortly.Indeed.But Im guessing that makes it even harder to extrapolate who could want it and what they want it for.Especially since the people who have the expertise you need are mostly going to have links either to the EGA or to the gemtechs themselves...Or both.Or both.So you cant ask them.But your hacker knew what he, or she, was looking for.If the stock was old then they wouldnt have found it in active datastreams, they would have been breaking into and trawling through archives.Searching for specific genetypes, around which there would have been no current research or chatter.Weve inferred from the start that they must have had a shopping list.But what connects the items on that list?You dont just splice random bits of genestock together and hope for the best.If the hacker already knew exactly what he or she wanted and exactly where it was, the hacks wouldnt have been needed in the first place.And you said there are a few hacked genetypes for which the corresponding genestock hasnt been stolenso presumably the hacker was able to determine that they didnt meet the criteria.What you need is someone who can reverse engineer that search, work out what those criteria were.You already know what they got, but it doesnt tell you enough.You need to find out what they were looking for.We cant, Sharon said grimly.Its not like I havent thought the same thing.But its too specialized for forensicstheyre not covering themselves in glory on this oneand the so called experts theyve consulted are no better.The people who understand genetype data well enough to have a chance of working it out are the same ones we cant talk to.I know someone you can talk to.Who?Rhys.Rhys?Sharon stared.What does he know about it?He doesnt know anything about your case, apart from that Herran was questioned.But he knows a lot about genetype files, and the data structures that store them.Hes spent years hacking into gemtech archives, trying to find particular genetypes.Hewhat?Excuse me?What?Sharon stopped in their slow perambulation around the vegetable beds and stared, open mouthed.How does that make him anything but a suspect?What genetypes?His own, and Gwens.They were the only survivors of a crche fire, they have no history.At first he was just curious about what they were intended fortheyve a wide variety of mental and physical enhancements, but theres no one big obvious thing.She shrugged deliberately, her wings rising with the movement, feathers softly ruffled by the morning breeze that blew off the river and across the roof garden.Then he started to have occasional spells of illness, seizures, and began searching in earnest.But thats only been in the last couple of years, long after the government copied over the datastreams.So his trace wouldnt be any part of what youre looking at.But it does mean he knows how to interrogate genetype data, and he knows the various gemtech archive structures inside out.I see.Sharon looked out across the Squats, chewing her lip thoughtfully.Did he find his own genetype in all his searching?No.But thats because the gemtech that owned the lab that engineered him and Gwen disappeared shortly after the fire, and no public records appear to have survived.This was when the truth about the gemtechs was starting to emerge, the first big scandals, and he found a few mentions of that particular company among those reports.KAG Labs.They had started off as a very big player in the early days post Syndrome, then had gradually shrunk to being an R&D affiliate and genestock supplier.They werent registered for in vivo work.So, considering what was going on at the time, its likely the directors scuttled the company, archived the datastream offlinemaybe even wiped it entirelyand ducked out of sight.If there had been anything left to find I am absolutely certain that he or Herran would have found it.Herran helped him look?Enough to confirm what Rhys already knew.He was very impressed, for whatever its worth.Rhys good job.Aryel took in Sharons frown and rolled her eyes.I assume your interview yesterday cleared him.It did.Which speaking as his friend makes me very relieved, but as a cop helps me not at all.I asked if he knew of anyone else who can do what he does, and he said no.He didnt mention Rhys.Rhys is different.His neural wiring is like yours and mine, but he and Gwen have phenomenally high IQs linked to an enhanced analytical ability.He was hoping hed pick up the KAG trail in the datastreams of other gemtechs, which would make sense if theyd sold the genestock on when they shut up shop.The point is, he was doing exactly the same thing that your hacker must have been doing.Thats why I think he might be able to help.Sharon nodded, seeing the logic of it, and trying to reconcile her knowledge that the investigation needed help with her instinctive reluctance to get even more people involved.Ill have to run it by Masoud.Cover us both.And of course Rhys may not even be interested.I think he will be.Why do you want him to take something like this on?Especially if hes not well?He is one hundred percent fine most of the time, and the attacks dont last very long when they do happen.Theyre scary and they tire him out, but he recovers completely within a day or two.It is worrying, and hes here to try to identify whatever it is and come up with a cure.That starts todayin a couple of hours, in fact.But he wont have to be at the hospital very much and hell be at loose ends, looking for something to occupy himself with.He has the skill, and its the kind of problem that will fascinate him.Sharon squinted at her.Have you already discussed this with him?No, I havent, I told you.Aryel took in her look.Sharon, come on.Im not that presumptuous.Im suggesting this because I think you can help each other, but its up to you.Youre suggesting it because you believe Rhys can find the answer, Sharon thought.Thats a thing to take seriously.And its not like its the first time weve turned to gem civilians with special skills.Thats how you met Gaela, remember?What had happened to Gaela and her family afterward pressed in on her consciousness, and her conscience.Stop it, Varsi.This is tablet work, he doesnt even have to come to the station.Hardly anyone will know.And anyway, the godgangs are gone.She looked for more tangible reasons to object, failed to find them, and nodded reluctantly.Where is he?Ill need to talk it through with him before I say anything to Masoud.Rhys was at that moment letting himself quietly into Aryels apartment, hoping he could make it to his room and into fresh clothes unnoticed.Not that they didnt all know he had spent the night with Callan, and he was well aware that there could be no escape from the inevitable teasing, but he didnt feel ready for it just yet.His body still thrummed with the pleasure of their early morning lovemaking, his lips still tingled from the last kiss at the door, and he wanted to let the bliss of it ebb out of him slowly, without interruption.He knew it was a lost cause the moment he stepped inside.Gwen looked up from the kitchen table where she sat with her tablet and the remains of breakfast, and arched a wicked eyebrow at him.Hello, sailor.Finally stepped the mainmast, have you?Oh god, Gwen.You shouldnt be saying that to me, surely.Im not going to be saying anything to you, if you keep this up.What do you expect, when you drift in at this hour?Looking...well, looking rather the better for wear, to be honest.I said he was good for you.And she smiled smugly, as if his liaison with Callan had been her idea in the first place.You have some nerve.When did you get back?Earlier this morning.How much earlier?Early enough to be showered and dressed and fed.She pushed a steaming mug toward him.Here.Ive had coffee.And eaten.Shut up, he said as her face sparkled with mischief.Wheres Da and Ari?Aris gone up to the roof to talk to Sharon, and Da walked Graca down to the river.Said hed be back in plenty of time.He doesnt need to come if he doesnt want to.Rhys, honestly, sometimes you really are an ass.Of course he wants to.I dont mean it like that.Havent you noticed how the aquatech is taking off?You probably havent.Anyway, its great but it means hes really busy, and I dont want him to feel like he has to choose between helping to close deals and babysitting me.He shrugged.Its not like theres anything he can do, except sit in a waiting room.She was staring at him.Rhys.He can talk to the doctors and have a look around, and feel like he knows whos taking care of his baby boy and whether theyre up to the job.Hes as worried about you as I am.Well, you can all stop.Worrying isnt going to help, and anyway I feel fine.Its been more than a week since the last one.So whats been different this past week?Let me thinkoh yes.The wicked grin was back.Gwen.How is the wonderful Callan?Wonderful.Leave him alone.I just wondered...Gwennie, if you start asking me things that are none of your business, Im going to start asking you things that are none of my business.She shut her mouth so sharply that he had to laugh, and felt vaguely triumphant that he had once again managed to catch her unawares.They were joined by Aryel and Sharon, who looked at him so intensely he felt his spine straighten.Something going on?He remembered the conversation last night.Is Herran all right?Herrans fine.Its you Id like to talk to.She chuckled at his expression.Not like that.Youve been recommended.Have you got a minute?Gwen looked curious, but Aryel planted herself firmly beside her at the table, and Rhys and Sharon went off to the living room.By the time theyd finished, he had barely twenty minutes left to get ready for the hospital.He thought about what Sharon had told him while he stripped, washed, and dressed in something that he hoped made him look like someone who would one day be there as a medical student, rather than a patient.It was an intriguing problem, and an important one, and hed said yes almost before she had finished asking the question.He could already feel himself planning how he would go about tackling it: building a mental framework to parse the different elements of the puzzle, organizing his lines of inquiry.He found that he was eager, almost impatient for the trip to the hospital to be over so he could get started.The realization caught him off guard as he pulled on a clean shirt.Thats why you suggested me, isnt it, Ari?Give the boy something to work on, something significant enough to really capture his attention, and maybe you can keep him healthy at the same time.He raked his fingers through his short, tight, ruby glowing curls and contemplated his reflection in the mirror.Well, thats fine with me.It could be the most useful thing anyones come up with yet.And this way, all that trawling through archives looking for things that werent there wont have been a complete waste of time.Binary       17 Less than a week had passed since Aryel Morningstar and Jeremy Temple declared themselves satisfied with the outcome of the negotiations, but Herran had not wanted to wait any longer.Eli found his enthusiasmif that was what it could be calledprofoundly strange, given what he now knew about the autistic gems previous life.He had expected Herran at least to insist that Aryel accompany them on the first day, and was surprised to find him perfectly sanguine about being escorted only by Callan and himself.They sat, three abreast in a BelNatur limousine, being conveyed in swift and silent luxury away from the Squats.He glanced over the fiery tangle of Herrans curls to Callans taller profile, topped by his matching glow.Callan felt the gaze and returned it.The soft smile that had been playing on his lips shifted to something more sardonic.Quite an upgrade.He whirled a languorous finger to indicate the compartment they occupied.Wasnt like this the last time I was aboard a BelNatur transport.Eli looked for any sign of a reaction from the driver, segregated behind his glass partition.There was none.He turned to the diminutive man who sat next to him.How about you, Herran?Do you remember being driven around?When you worked for them before?Dark, said Herran promptly.He sat up straight, his entire upper body rotating as he made a 180 degree scan of the windows.The morning bustle of the city flashed past.He settled back against the plush upholstery.Not so comfy.Callan chuckled.Damn straight.He shifted, stretched out his legs.They certainly seem to be making an effort.Eli replayed his conversations with Aryel, their speculation about the depth of the BelNatur transformation.It had been borne out so far by the alacrity with which the firm had acceded to every safeguard they had required for Herran, and the seniority of the staff members who had been sent into the Squats to meet him and be scrutinized by his friends.On the one hand it might indicate just how much of a barrier the digital neural transcription problem presented, and how many of their hopes were pinned on his being able to solve it.But if that were the only reason then the public announcement of the projectbefore securing his participation, let alone confirming his usefulnesswas more than a little preemptive.BelNatur, said Callan thoughtfully, has never done things halfway.Not in my memory anyway, and Gaela and others who are older than me have said the same thing.Ive heard stories about some of the other gemtechs, the corners they cut.Gempro was known for it, and youve heard Mik go on about Recombin.BelNatur prided themselves on being different.Whatever they decided to do, they made a total commitment.Same ethos, new objectives?Maybe.They were delivered to the main entrance, the driver out and opening the door for them before Eli could move.Heads turned as Herran hopped down after him, and passersby stopped and stared as Callan emerged.He straightened up, rocking back on his heels a little as he took in the hard black glass that curved away from them.When he looked back down at Herran his smile was crooked.Still sure about this?Sure.Herran was already trotting up the steps to the entrance.Eli took them two at a time and caught up with him.Just remember, he said quietly.If you change your mind, if you want to stop, get out, go home, just say so.Home later.Suppertime.Yes, but Eli caught Callans tiny shake of the head, coupled with a grimace.He sighed and let it go.Aryel and Callan had both assured him that Herran knew what he was doing, and also knew he could stop doing it whenever he chose.And anyway, no one could read his cues as well as Callan.Inside the black glass and white marble of the lobby, another surprise.Striding forward to meet them, Zavcka Klist.Gentlemen, welcome.Her eyes met Elis.He was conscious that she had not greeted him by name, although, despite the fact that BelNatur had engineered both Herran and Callan into existence, he was the only one of the trio she had met before.The enmity that had been between them at their last encounter might be reason enough for that.But she was looking him straight in the face, frank and open, and he knew suddenly that the point was to give no appearance of prioritizing her single norm visitor over the two gems.But he was a half stride ahead of them, Herran having halted abruptly in the face of her brash advance, and Callan stopping with him.Eli let momentum carry him forward.This was as good a time as any to see if they had taken into account what working with Herran was going to entail.Ms.Klist.Its been a while.She shook his hand, the firm grip he remembered.Dr.Walker.A thin smile.As at their first meeting, it did not touch her eyes.Thank you for agreeing to assist us.He sensed that she had bitten back the word finally, as she glanced past him to where Herran stood like a statue, head lowered and hands hanging like stones at his side.Callan, standing close alongside with his own hands thrust into his pockets, gave her a cool stare and looked pointedly past her to another woman who stood a couple of respectful paces back.She came forward now, moving with the calm unfussiness they had taught her, flicking a look at Zavcka as she went past.She greeted Eli and Callan first, then stood in front of Herran, just out of reach and with her own arms quiet at her sides.Hello, Herran.Are you well?A long pause.Herran peeked up, pale eyes glinting behind surprisingly long lashes.He nodded, rocking a little at the waist.Sevi.Good.I. ..she glanced back at Zavcka.My boss would like to meet you.Is that okay?Zavcka had gone still and quiet and watched keenly as Sevi Romero, senior neurolinguist, had taken point.Now she stepped forward as Sevi had done, her movements turned measured and slow, tone pitched low and reassuring.Hello, Herran.I am Zavcka.Eli saw Callan register the given name and altered body language with the same twitch of surprise as himself.Are you well?An even longer pause this time, the rocking more pronounced, but Herrans eyes through his lashes were steady on her face.Zavcka, he said finally.Herran.Well.Thank you for coming.Were really looking forward to working with you.They watched each other for a moment longer.She straightened up just as Callan cleared his throat gently to signal Enough.Her eyes lingered on Callans face too, as the final introduction was made; a face still beautiful, but no longer completely perfect.Callan kept his hands in his pockets and pinned her with that cool green stare.It was a look so knowing that Eli, had it been aimed at him, felt he would have had to take it on somehow, or else flee in embarrassment.Zavcka betrayed nothing but the same professionally polished politeness she had shown throughout.She shepherded them swiftly through the registration of tablets and fingerprints.Eli could tell from the bewildered looks they got that the chief executives personal attention to such minutiae was not common practice.But then neither, anymore, was the sight of gems within the walls of a gemtech.The word must have gone out, he decided, as an urbane young man who had materialized apparently out of thin air to assist now ushered them into a elevator.There was no blatant staring.The girl on reception had smiled timidly at Callan, and not gawked at Herran.If comments were being made people were waiting until they were well out of earshot.They stayed silent as they were whisked upward, their awareness of Herran, facing into a corner with his back to them, a palpable thing.Callan leaned against the wall beside him in an elegant, protective slouch and Eli flanked Herran on the other side, feet apart and hands together in what felt uncomfortably like a sentrys pose.He watched Callan and the assistant, Khan, size each other up.Khan looked away a moment later.What Eli could see of his face was tinged a delicate pink.Callan tipped his head back and gazed up at the mirrored ceiling, the wry smile twitching back onto his lips, the red shimmer of his hair the only blush about him.Four floors of the tower had been given over to the new infotech division, but their first view of it was not impressive.A blank wall greeted them, unbroken save for the faint outline of a door and the identipad inset beside it.Eli glanced back into the empty elevator before the doors slid closed, certain that the call buttons had already been fingerprint sensitive.Double screening, said Sevi, following the look.In case someone who doesnt have authorization gets out alongside someone who does.She stepped up to the identipad, eyes and fingers aligned to the scanners as she spoke into the device.Hold for group entry.They all shuffled forward, Herran up on tiptoe to get his face high enough.Eli went last, and felt his tablet thrum faintly as its signal was scanned and accepted in tandem with his own.The door slid open.What greeted them on the other side was not what hed expected.They stood in a well lit, casually disorderly lobby area, surrounded by scattered clumps of low, comfortable looking furniture.He could feel the dead air of a damper field, located there no doubt to minimize the disturbance of people coming and going from the floor as much as to provide a place for private conversation.Beyond it, rows of screens and workstations radiated away in every direction, manned by what he immediately thought of as a motley crew of technicians.A few looked to be his age; most were younger, and none older.Although there was an air of intense busyness about the place it nevertheless felt informal, in a way that Eli recognized from his own university days.It was far removed from his memories of typical gemtech ambience.No white coats, Callan murmured.Zavcka looked over at him.No.Some of the work requires clean rooms and suits, but apart from that we thought it would be better if it didnt feel like a traditional lab.Eli kept his eyes on Herran, who had walked without hesitation out of the damper field and made straight for the nearest empty workstation, which had an overlarge monitor and integrated input screen.A couple of people working beyond it looked up, startled.They took in Herrans hair and scarred face, the taller, similarly flame haired figure of Callan in the background and Sevi shaking her head at them with a finger to her lips, and went back to their own work, although they continued to cast interested glances in Herrans direction.He stood stock still in front of the screen, ignoring them all as he scanned the feed.Is that a recent decision?asked Eli, still watching him.In his peripheral vision he saw the two women exchange glances.Yes, Zavcka said.Some of the researchers did wear them, although there was no real reason for it.Force of habit.But, her eyes flicked between Herran and Callan, we didnt want you to feel like you were back in the old BelNatur.Behind her Khan smiled a little.Eli felt certain that this touch had been his idea.I see.Callans tone was flat.Eli jumped into a stretching silence.I was surprised youd located the project here.Yeah.Callan, not looking around, frowning a little as he regarded Herran.Labs and dorms used to be way out in the sticks.Zavcka stepped in beside him, so that they stood companionably side by side just within the damper field, watching the small gem.Herran had pulled his own tablet out and was doing something with it, without taking his eyes off the main screen.The agricultural divisions still are, of course, she said.There were pragmatic reasons for locating this project at headquarterswe have a lot more empty space here now and the location is convenient.But I am also determined to ensure that wethe administrative staff, the executivesnever again allow ourselves to become divorced from what it is that we actually do.She turned her head, speaking quietly now to Callans profile.I understand how hard it must have been for youboth of youto decide to come here.I know that as far as youre concerned we are on probation.I know that we are not likely ever to be forgiven.I get it.I cant change the past, Callan.He looked back at her, arms folded across his chest, eyes like hard green stones.Eli wondered if she was going to finish the speech with I can only try for a better future, or some similar platitude, and whether Callan could contain himself if she did.Instead he dropped his arms and strode away from her and out into the room, his attention back on Herran.Eli moved instinctively after him, and felt the others follow.Callans voice was low and steady as he left the noise suppression of the damper field behind, but it carried the hint of a huskiness that Eli recognized.Hey, Herr.So.What dyou think?Okay.Not bad.Eli realized that the feed scrolling across the monitor had changed subtly while Herran had been standing there.Mostly not stupid.Sevis jaw dropped.Callan looked over at her.That might not sound like a compliment, but it is.Um.Herran.Sevi was visibly working out how to structure what she wanted to say.Eli turned around, caught Khan throwing his boss a worried glance and Zavcka Klist opening her mouth to speak.He was almost relieved to see a flash of the old, peremptory arrogance in the crease between her brows, the flare of her nostrils and the tilt of her head.Eli held her gaze and shook his head deliberately.He mouthed, No.But Khan started, eyes darting between them.Eli spoke quietly and evenly, conscious of the audience of staff members now obviously paying attention to them and the need both to explain and to reassert the ground rules.This is what it means to work with Herran.Looking at your systems to him is like looking around this room for the rest of us.Its how he orients himself, how he knows where he is.Hes not going to do any harm.Zavckas jaw tightened.Her eyes bored into him.Beside her Khan fidgeted, but neither spoke.Behind him Eli could hear Sevi, with help from Callan, get a monosyllabic version of the same reassurance from Herran.He turned around.All set?Set.Herrans small fingers slid across the workstation input.His other hand clutched his own tablet to his chest.Put back.Quick quick.See?The feed now looked as it had when they first entered, although Eli would have been hard pressed to describe exactly what the difference had been.Herran looked up at him, face as devoid of expression as ever, pale eyes innocently blinking.Callans tightly controlled anger of a few minutes ago appeared to have been replaced by a coiled, toxic amusement.He looked over Herrans head at Zavcka.We can continue, he said, if youd like.Although his voice was measured and calm there was a whiplash edge to it now that reminded Eli of Aryel.She took them through the ranks of programmers and past the prototyping rooms, pausing here and there for explanations and to let them meet key personnel.It had been made clear that a mass introduction would be counterproductive as far as Herran was concerned, and not particularly useful for anyone else.But there seemed a determination to display every element of the project, and to ensure that everyone who was a part of it was subjected to the visitors scrutiny.Eli remembered Mikals comment about transparency, and the way he too appeared to have been welcomed into the organization.He decided they must really be serious when she let the technician who was leading on development of the cranial interface explain exactly how they thought it could work.He lingered over the mockups they had been shown, feeling a little sick, and sensed Zavcka pause beside him.Youre using what you learned from Gabriel.Yes.Her eyes met his for a moment, before they slid away to rest on the delicate headbands arrayed on the bench.She spoke as if to the equipment.We still dont understandI dont think anyone does, even nowhis ability to experience the thoughts of others.Some kind of synaptic hypersensitivity, although how thats not completely overwhelmed by background radiation...Anyway.She shook her head.He showed us it was possible.If you boost the signal and damp down the interference, thoughts are transmissible.The problem is understanding them.That hasnt been his problem.No.Quite the opposite.Poor child.She stepped briskly away from the workbench.Fortunately, deactivating the interface at will has proved to be fairly simple for us.I imagine he must wish for a similar switch for his own ability.I imagine he must.He did not try to keep the acid out of his voice.She strode ahead without responding.Callan looked back and raised a questioning eyebrow.Eli scowled at him and shook his head.They ended in Sevis lab, a light, open space that bore little resemblance to the testing chambers of old.It was full of neuringuists and psychologists eager to meet Herran.Eli watched keenly as Sevi showed him the ergonomically padded, articulated chairs, with their sensor arrays draped like gossamer diadems over the high backs.Herran poked a finger into the upholstery.Comfy.Yes, everyone thinks so.Weve all taken a turn.Part of setting up the baseline.Herran inspected the arms and footrest of the chairs.Callan smiled grimly, as though he knew what was coming.No straps.Sevi looked genuinely horrified.No, of course not.Good.Straps bad.He looked up at Eli, rock nodding.New chairs.I should think so.Looks okay to you, Herran?Okay.Excellent.I wonder, glancing first at Callan, then at Zavcka, if I could have a quick word with Ms.Klist?There are a few things we should clear up.If she was annoyed there was no sign of it.They left Khan hovering around the edges of the group as Herran hopped up into one of the chairs and pulled out his tablet, and Callan settled down to discuss the details of the next few days with Sevi and the rest of her team.Zavcka led the way to one of the huge parabolic windows that made up the skin of the building.There was the same relaxed scattering of low furniture that appeared to be ubiquitous throughout these floors, and the falling away of external sound as they stepped inside another damper field.She folded elegantly into a chair, watching as he lowered himself to one opposite.We havent yet discussed my role here.The others must know Im going to be doing more than taking care of Herran.Your broader remit has been made clear to them.I admit I wasnt thrilled at first I imagine not.but Ive revised my opinion.You and I did not part as friends, Dr.Walker, and as much as anything that was down to your absolute willingness to speak your mind, regardless of the consequences.She frowned.AryelMs.Morningstarsays she wants you to assess the ethical framework we now abide by and see if it stacks up, with the understanding that if you think it doesnt, or if there are steps you recommend that were not willing to take, Herran will pull out immediately.Thats only a threat to us if we havent done as well as we think, and arent willing to try to do better.Well, we have and we are.Ive decided to think of you as a sort of external auditor.Youll have access to all the personnel and files you need.All I ask is that you look at where we are now, not where we were four or five or ten years ago.Thats what Aryel specified as well.And that if you do conclude were on the right track you allow us to quote you.He sat back and regarded her.The charm offensive of the past hour, the deference of the past ten days, began to make sense.Thats a big if.And if you misquote me, or take me out of context, Ill embarrass you.Badly.I understand.Ive had my fill of underestimating you, Dr.
