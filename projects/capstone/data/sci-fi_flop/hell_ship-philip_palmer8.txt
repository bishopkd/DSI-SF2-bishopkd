You remember nothing?I said, sadly.There is nothing to remember!Fray roared.Dont lie!Dont tell these lies!Lirilla too had no past memories of me; nor did Lardoi, or Miaris, or Raoild, or Biark, Sahashs, Loramas, Thugor, Amur, Kairi,          Wapax, Fiymean, or Krakkka; nor many others of those who had fought that day and died at Sharrocks behest.Only Quipu and          I and a sprinkling of others could bear witness to the events of the day.The rest had been resurrected as the creatures they          were when their worlds were first lost.And so I was living with utter strangers who had been my intimate companions for centuries.Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer Our missiles have lost velocity.No damage has been caused to their hull.Their shields were fully charged; they were ready for us.Of course they were.This is a game to them.Again, missiles fly!And so we fight.We, this computer brain and I, have been preparing for this battle for so many years.And yet now its happening, I feel totally          unprepared.Panic consumes me.Each small setback disheartens me.I am convinced in my soul that we will lose, and all will          be for naught.Explorer, fortunately, is not so temperamental; she fights with a savagery and a guile that awes me.And so, once again, our missiles fire and rift through space and then strike the forceshields of the Death Ship; and instantly          lose momentum and drift aimlessly.But this time, before they can be destroyed, we trigger the detonators and all the missiles          erupt as one, creating a halo of energy the size of a star around the black sailed ship.Nothing can survive this.But a moment later we realise the black sailed ship is behind us.It has rifted to safety.And our forceshields are overheating,          as it bathes us in sheets of energy and then        We, too, rift to safety.Hell Ship           Sai ias I felt a tingle of anxiety down my central spine.I was walking through the grasslands near the savannah, to join Quipu and Lirilla.And as I approached Quipu, I saw his heads          flick uncontrollably, for a just a moment.And I noticed an excited light in his five pairs of eyes.Whats wrong?I asked, puzzled.Somethings happening said Quipu One.with the ship, said Quipu Two.How can you tell?I asked.The heads replied, babblingly: The engine noise.The force of artificial gravity.The clarity of the light.The density of [Quipu used a word I could not fathom].You can detect all that?I asked.Perhaps we have collided, said Quipu One, with an object in space Or been attacked by, said Quipu Three.Some other vessel, said Quipu Four.The light is degrading; the power sources are being diverted.The Hell Ship is in trouble.One way or another, it is experiencing          some kind of appalling catastrophe, said Quipu Five triumphantly.Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer The battle rages, if space battles can actually rage; for the explosions are eerily silent.And, despite the use of rift weapons,          the pace of the action is often stately.It is a dance of light and power and confusion, to the music of an imaginary band;          the sleek and black sailed Death Ship and the now vast and ugly and ungainly Explorer craft flicker frantically through rift          space leaving missiles scattered and exploding in all the places where they are absent.Explorer and I no longer speak.We are lost in the moment, the to and fro of missiles and energy beams, the switching of shield          patterns, the ceaseless rifting to safety just in the nick of time.We use our drone ships and robot missiles to create a second and a third and a fourth and a fifth front to the battle.The          power of our weapons is awesome, even to meaccustomed as I am to the vast battle fleets of the Olara.For we have spent all          this time building up an armoury that dwarfs anything known before in any of the universes.The ship too has grown; it is          five hundred thousand times the size it was when Galamea was her commander.And much of the bulk consists of weapons and energy          sources and shield generators and layers of armoured hull within more layers of armoured hull.But despite our vast bulk we are swift.Swifter than the Death Ship.And powerful.More powerful than the Death Ship.And          adept at rifting.More adept than they are.Yet why are we not triumphing?Again and again the Death Ship suffers damage that ought to be fatal, but again and again it          survives.Then the Death Ship starts to waver.It has switched on its disreality drive in order to escape to another universe.We attack on all fronts.We charge the Death Ship.This time it cannot endure.Hell Ship           Sai ias What kind of catastrophe?I asked.Can you feel that?said Quipu One.And I could; the tingle down the spine again, coupled with a sense of oddness.Were passing through a strange place, said Quipu Two.Experiencing some kind of reality dilation, said Quipu Three.It is time, said Quipu Four.Every seventy two of my years, with some degree of variation, this sensation occurs.But we          do not know why.We suspect dimensional or rift travel of some extraordinary kind is occurring.The oddness intensified.I braced myself; this was a familiar sensation to me also, after all these years on the ship.Yet          it was still deeply eerie and unsettling.I felt        as if I existed in a million places all at once.I felt sick.Bile rose up in my mouth And finally, NO!The strangeness ended.We were back to normal.And I was baffled.This shouldnt have happened!Normally the strangeness lasted an hour or more.Had something gone wrong with the Kauns technology?Would they be unable, this time, to flee from their pursuers?Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer The Death Ship is trapped by our disjunctive energy lattices which wrap around the black sailed ship like webbing around a          flailing insect.And we fire another fusillade of missiles from all our vessels, for Explorer and I now exist in sixty different          ships at the same time.The odds are overwhelming!We surely must prevail!Hell Ship           Sai ias Quipu and I looked at each other; puzzled and alarmed.The strangeness had passed, but now a terrible foreboding filled us.Then the ground beneath us shook.Weve been hit!Quipu One exulted.Someone is actually firing missiles at the ship!That is, screamed Quipu Two, a fair surmise.The ground shook again.The aerials in the sky were dashed out of their flight patterns, thrown around like pebbles tossed          in the air.And the skythe sky!actually flickered.And then the earth rocked violently to one side and I was rolled across          the grass.Nearby Fray fell too, then fumbled up to her feet, and bellowed at me.Quipu was hissing with fear, clinging to a tree with his strong feet.Lirilla screamed, with rapid shrill shrieks like nothing          I had ever heard before.And then the world turned upside down.And the waters from the lakes and rivers were now pouring down upon us like rain.And creatures were tumbling through air,          clutching at trees and rocks, and the air, the air itself was whirling in thick clouds and we were all choking, unable to          breath.Whats happening?someone screamed.Is something attacking us?another voice yelled.I believe so!screamed Quipu One.Ive never felt it like this The gravity!screamed Quipu Two, has failed!Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer The hull is ruptured.The Death Ship is dying.Weve won.Weve won!Havent we?Hell Ship           Sai ias Someone or something is destroying us!I said exultantly, but no one could hear my words, because of the falling of water          and the screaming of aerials tumbling out of the sky and land creatures falling up into the air.The sky flickered again.Once again the ship changed course violently, and we were thrown around wildly.Gravity mercifully returned, and we crashed back down to the ground.Then the earth beneath us trembled even more wildly.Lirilla hovered by my head, bruised and shrieking with pain.I caught her in my tentacle, and tucked her in my mouth to keep          her safe.There was a long silence.The ground beneath us shuddered and shook again.Im certain now that were being struck by missiles, or energy blasts, or both, Quipu One finally concluded.Were under          constant enemy attack.Can they actually defeat the Hell Ship though?I asked.I doubt that, said Quipu One sadly.We sent our own fleet against this vessel and they pounded it with weapons; nothing          could break though its force shield.The Hell Ship is invulnerable to all        But a final shudder threw us off our feet again.There was a roaring sound.I could tell that something terrible was occurring.However, we might very well be wrong about that!said Quipu Five brightly.And then the shuddering reached its frenzied peak; and the Hell Ship, shockingly, e x p l o d e d.                Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer We watch, in awe and marvelment, as the hull of the Death Ship rips open and bodies begin pouring out.We realise that many          of these bodies are captives of the Death Ship because they come in such varied shapes and sizes and none are wearing body          armour.The bodies explode when they enter a state of vacuum, and the carnage appals us.But all on board the ship must die.There is no other way.We harden our heart.Hell Ship           Sai ias After the explosion, the ground below me opened up.And I found myself tumbling into the hole and then falling and flailing          wildly through the layers of the hull itself, until I was floating freely in black space.And all was calm and silence, though all about me bodies were erupting into blood and gore.I alone had survived the rupture          of the ships hull.When I looked more carefully around, I could see the many unfamiliar stars that were the hazy backdrop to the myriad corpses          of creatures I had known and liked, now ripped into pieces.And, stretching out beneath me like a continent seen from the          air, was a huge and eerily beautiful black sailed space vessel with a silver, glowing hull.But though magnificent, the ship was rent and broken.The sails were slack.And bodies continued to pour out of the several          huge cracks in the hull and, for reasons I didnt fathom, they continued to explode and die.Small pieces of flesh and slicks          of blood hung messily in space in seeming orbit around my body; and would remain out here as undecayed fragments, I supposed,          for all eternity.I prayed that my friends were safe, as I sucked up breath from my lungs into my mouth (for Lirilla was trapped there and would          need to breathe) and spread my cape and soared through space, propelling myself with gusts of air from my gills, away from          the damaged Hell Ship.Joy!I was free!And instead of breathing air, I was now breathing energy, captured from the undertow of all space that only my kind seem able          to perceive and access.And instead of drinking water, I was supping the light from the stars and making it into me.And instead of being trapped in a globular cage that mockingly pretended to be a planet, I was swooping through a small and          precious portion of the infinity of space; and I exulted at the end of my captivity!I noted however that the main part of the Kauns ship was still intact, even though the rear area had been holed; and I knew          that the battle was far from over.Then I looked further, using eyes that were as powerful as telescopes, and saw the Hell Ships enemy vessela huge and ugly          spaceship that looked as if it had been constructed by a blind creature with more energy and materials than talent.And at          the heart of the asymmetric more planet than spaceship was a striped hub that looked as if it had once been the entire original          craft.And from this monstrous murder machine pillars of missiles were pouring forth then vanishing then crashing against the shields          of the Hell Ship; these corporeal bomb blasts followed instants later by vision bending stems of light that also thrashed          the Hell Ships beautiful lines.Smaller vessels scattered in space were also playing a vicious harrying role in this anarchic          battle of light and energy; spitting missiles then darting elsewhere before reprisal could strike.The pace and blur and bright          and splash of it all made my perceptions swim; I felt as if I were on the inside a star watching a deadly duel between sunlight          and plasma.And suddenly, I could hear voices, in my head: After all these years Well kill the parent fuckers!Kill them!Dont miss.I shall not miss.As the voices spoke, more missiles were launched from the Kaun ship and travelled instantaneously through space and exploded          on the hull of its enemy vessel.Light splashed on the vast and ugly hull of our potential saviours, but no damage was done;          and then the saviour craft retaliated, and haloes of light now appeared above the Hell Ship and crashed down upon it, striking          sparks like burning fronds spat from the mouth of a Padiux.The blackness of deep space was lit up by missiles exploding and light haloes writhing and burning, and the invisible walls          of protective energy around both ships glowed brightly, oh so brightly, to my eyes which saw energy as if it were light.The space between the ships shimmered as deadly beams of energy were unleashed and repelled and reflected back.I could hear atoms fusing and sundering and interacting to form massive eruptions of raw power that seared my sight.And I          could sense the universe itself being bruised as the two ships dived in and out of tunnels in space, to emerge once more vomiting          forth fire and metal and nuclear holocaust.The attacking ship vanished; reappeared; vanished; reappeared; and for one astonishing moment it appeared beneath me and my          claws were scratching at its hull; and then it was gone again.And a moment later, a jagged spike of coloured energy shot through the glow of the Kaun ships shields, and struck the Kaun          ship itself, and my vision blurred again as the massive impact shook the very soul of my perception.And, as I watched, more bodies billowed out of the hole in the rear of the Kaun vessel.I glided closer to see them and I recognised arboreals and aerials and sessiles who had been sucked out of the ship, and I          saw too        I saw too a body in a space suit, with a face as black as a starless sky, and its voice spoke to me.Rescue me, I am your master, said the voice, and I knew it was a Kaun.It was small, a biped, protected by its space suit but cast adrift into space in the midst of this dazzling space war.I wrapped my tentacle around the Kauns body.You can fly in space?You crazy Saviour shagger!cackled the Kaun.I wanted to break the evil bastards body in half with my tentacle and eat him; just as Djamrock would have done.And I imagined how that would feel: I imagined the Kauns howls of pain, slowly fading as he died.And I felt a rush of exhilaration.It was in my power to kill a Kaun!And the power felt good.ButI couldnt do it.For some reason, my limbs would not obey me.And so I relaxed the tightness of grip on the Kaun; I still held him in my tentacle,          but gently now.I raged at myself; I did not lack the will or desire to kill this creature, but suddenly my body was not my own.Thats better.You always do as we tell you, dont you, sea monster?Now, take me back to the shsaid the Kaun, then a stray energy beam caught him and his head vanished.He was dead.But not through my doing.The energy beam also raked my body in passing; I absorbed it, and grew.Then out of the front part of the ship, a new vessel appeared, in a twisting turning shape which I knew was called a Helix.And the Helix darted towards the enemy ship, raining missiles as it flew.But the enemy ship ignored it, and continued firing its missiles upon the Hell Ship itself.The Helix faded into nothing;          it was a mirage, a trick.And then another missile struck the Hell Ships hull; and time itself seemed to stand still as the Hell Ship erupted in a          massive explosion, a single dazzling flash!The ship lit up like a Biollai seed exploding and igniting in mid air.And then the light faded and there was nothing left.No Hell Ship, just debris.The corona of light had dazzled my eyes, though I felt no heat on my carapace.I floated in space with my cape outspread and          the memory of the dead Kaun in the spacesuit haunting my mind.And I realised that it was all over.All my friends were dead; but so were all the Kaun.Fragments of the hull of the Hell Ship drifted closer to me.Corpses and coils of blood and limbs and torsos and heads and          ruptured internal organs cluttered the once empty blackness of space.The attacking ship was badly damaged, but intact.I began to glide towards it, hoping they would realise I was a friend and          not Kaun.But something held me, and tugged at me; I felt as if I was in a dream and had no power over my own body.I was          being pulled, pulled, pulled        And then the pulling stopped.But when I tried once more to glide through space, I found I could not.I could no longer swirl          and swoop, and I could not go beyond a certain point here.Or a certain point        there.These obstacles to my movements were corporeal.Not like a force shield, such as that which surrounded the Tower; more like          walls.I was surrounded by walls!I summoned my inner eyes and saw the truth; and the truth was that I was no longer in space surrounded by stars; I was in          a hangar bay shaped like a huge globe within a space vessel.And the walls of my confining space were silver, just like my          cabin; the light was pale and yellow, just like the light from our sun.I was back inside the Hell Ship.And the strangeness was upon me again.We were travelling somewhere far away; escaping the enemys wrath.I spat, and Lirilla emerged from my mouth.Safe?she asked, plaintively.Not safe, I told her, sombrely.My cape retreated back into my body.And I realised that the destruction of the Hell Ship had, like the appearance of the          smaller Helix vessel, been just an illusion.The Hell Ship had been damaged, I was sure of that, but not destroyed.And then it had fled; and it was now, once again, swimming          in what Quipu called the rivers of chaotic flux until, at some point, it would re enter the Real.And then it would all, the terror and the horror, begin again.Hell Ship           Jak/Explorer What joy!What release!After all this time, theyre dead!Those cruel parent fuckers are dead!Weve won!You know, I cant believe it!To see that black sailed vessel engulfed in the flames of a space burning missile.To know that,             finally, we have managed to take revenge for what they did to Olara!And to my family on Olara.And to all my people.The             ghosts of all these Olarans will Say something Explorer?Weve won.Havent we?Tell me we have won?Why arent you speaking to me?Im not sure exactly what happened there.What the fornication are you on about?You saw it.We both saw it.Sensors, visuals, all confirm.The Hell Ship blew up and             is no more.Wait.Tell me what you detect.I detect many things.Then tell me what you conclude.The data is inconclusive.And what does the inconclusive data suggest to your wreck of a mind?It suggest there is no debris consistent with the explosion of such an exceptionally large rift drive space vessel.Its chaff,          bits of matter scattered in a pattern that superficially resembles a blown up spaceship.What are you saying?And please dont say it, even if its true.No, tell mewhat?It was a trick.We did not destroy the Death Ship.An illusion?A corporeal holographic projection, that disintegrated in front of our eyes and registered on all my sensors.Like the Helix          ship we fought, which they expected us to treat as the real vessel but which turned out to be nothing but a chimera.These          creatures have technology that allows them to mimic reality with remarkable verisimilitude to all our electromagnetic, visual          and mass sensors.They duped us twice in other words, and the second time we fell for it; and the Death Ship used the moment          of the deceptive distraction to evade our restraining lattices and enter another universe.Bastards.As you say, bastards.And now we are giving chase.We can do that?We are doing it.How can we do that?We have no way of knowing which universe they are in, surely?You swore to me that I DONT KNOW HOW WE CAN DO IT.I AM JUST ATTEMPTING TO DO IT, OUT OF COMPLETE FUCKING DESPERATION.I understand, calm yourself.It is folly.We can never find them.But we shall try.Instead of waiting here, we will pursue avidly.But not by travelling          through a single universe at a time.No, we shall stay here at the Source and dip in and out of a million different universes          with dazzling speed until we smell our prey.Because I believe we can detect them from afar now; I know the trail they leave.Death, destruction, and messages from lost civilisations trapped in the ripples of reality.Thendo it.I am doing it.And so we rift once more through the Source itself.Through an area of space where reality is riven with cracks.And we Yes we We arrive, somewhere.Somewhere very strange.Our sensors arethe very atoms are We adapt, somehow, to this new reality.We absorb the new parameters and constants.This is now our universe.Can we detect them here, Jak?Help me please, I need your help, you are invaluable to me in this vital stage of our missionplease?I can detect nothing.Justmurk.I can see nothing through our visual sensors.No sound pictures are emerging.Electromagnetics             are fuzzy.Try harder.You can see what I see.Nothing.Admit it.You do not need me, Explorer.I am very little help to you.You are just trying tono matter.I shall not let you             down.I am reading the data nowfuck my father these readings are utter chaos!What the hell is wrong with our instruments?Our instruments are fine.There is nothing to see.How can that be?There must be SOMETHING out there; or if not, then nothing.But notthis whatever it is.Void, confusion, something but not something, Memories of worlds, or possibilities of worlds.And pain.Terrible terrible          pain.I dont know.Its confusing.Tell me what you think is out there.You must be able to make a credible surmise.Please.ItsI cannotconfusingchaosno.Yes.Now I see it.It is a dead universe; dead but bleeding, and in pain.Do not ask me how.The Kaun once were here; but not recently; not          for many years.Where are we now?I do not know.I can, you will not be surprised to hear, once more make no sense of the data from our sensors.But perhaps you can fare better;             can you detect anything?I detect nothing.Then we should move on.Wait!Im aware of asomething.Awhat?Yes!I have it.A shadow on my sensors that my circuits can perceive as absence with intent.Another ghost signal, for our          archives, from a past version of this universe.Capture it.I have, it is downloaded.Can you read it?Not yet.Now?Yes, now.Tell me.Once, this universe was thronging with life.Trillions of planets were habitable.Thousands of sentient species lived in harmony.And this is the remnant of the trace of a communication from one of these species.Another last message?Indeed.From another lost civilisation.A sun worshipping people whose science took the form of poetry and who dreamed one          day of settling the stars, to worship them too.We must keep this record in our archives.I have kept it.We must remember these people, these sun worshipping star dreaming poets.I do not know how to forget.I cant see anything, again.What can your sensors tell you now?Nothing.Just another empty universe.But there are traces of radiation scarred into this void.Fusion bombs were exploded          in this place once, and their radioactive residue remains, even while matter itself decoupled and became non matter.I am downloading the radiation signatures and decoding them.I have completed downloading the radiation signatures and decoding them.Decoding them?There is something anomalous about the radiation patterns; it occurred to me that a sophisticated civilisation might have          chosen to self destruct using atomic bombs with a message encoded within.And so it has proved.These peoples wrote a message          in the burning fire that consumed them.This was a civilisation that could use radiation as other cultures use paper.Tell me more.I have archived it; you may read it at your leisure.I will do so.These messages from the dead constitute an extraordinary phenomenon: like finding the history of an entire world scratched          into the wood of a small boys desk, if I may utilise an archaic simile.Im reading the archive now.These people had discovered, after years of careful scientific analysis, that their distant ancestors             had evolved from microbes embedded in comets.In other words, they were descended from space travellers.This historical fact             infused every aspect of their post scientific culture.They were inveterate stargazers.They were vegetarian, and worshipped             the bark of the trees they ate.They had no weapons, for in all their long history they had never encountered a predator they             could not out run.They had long slender legs and streamlined bodies, and fingers that could be retracted into their jaws.I can see an image of one of them now, its strangely beautiful.They procreated by cell fission at the point of death; each             dying creature of this species spawning a fresh child.So in a sense, they were immortal.They were lovers of life, and caused             no harm to any other creature aside, perhaps, from the trees they ate.And now they are gone.Its sad.So very sad.I have no view to add to yours on the emotional affect of this data.But logic asserts that a fellow organic sentient would          find little pleasure in such death messages, and so sad is a response I might have predicted.And now, I am entering  another universe.And I find I am above a blue globe patched with clouds.A fertile planet, with oceans and cloudsit must have life?My sensors          check.No, there is no life.But life once did exist here, many aeons ago, and it has a left a trace that I am able to detect.There          were once seas of acid here, rich with acid loving fish and acid eating algae and land made up of boiling volcanic lava that          was seething with extremophile microbial and plant life and mountain tops coated with grass on which six legged beasts roamed.What could have happened to it?Was it another victim of the Death Ships incomparable evil, or did life just die out?I have seen enough; I jump through another reality rift  and emerge in the heart of a spiral galaxy; no trace of the Death Ships distinctive ion trail here either.No legacy of carnage          and destruction.Nor any trace of the absence of life.Just life.Life all around.Wherever I look, there is life.There are trillions of habitable planets in this universe.And thousands          of sentient species in possession of space travelling technology.I read the messages in the electromagnetic data trail and the space time substrate and I record it all.It is all here, every          detail of this wonderful universe.There is one planet in this universe where insects have created cities of steel that burrow          down deep almost to the planets inner core.The entire planet is an insect nest made of metal and plastic and the large mammals          are kept as foodstuffs and as objects of scientific study.A cruel world, according to the morals of the Olarans who designed my programming, yet          a magnificent achievement; a planet over run with genius bugs.And there is an Olara like space travelling civilisation too in this universe which has engineered stars to burn brighter,          or fainter, in order to improve the appearance of their night time sky; and has constructed ringworlds, and planetary bridges          made of rainbow coloured unbreakable motile glass.There are many galactic civilisations here; and also solitary world civilisations which have no idea whatsoever that they          share this reality with so many varied and powerful sentient beings.And there are wraiths tooenergy beings with intelligence          but no corporeal formcreatures that are legends in the Olaran universe, but are here all too real and detectable by sensors.It is a rich and bountiful universe; there is malice here, but also goodness.There are wars, and death comes undesiredly          and all too soon for many of these sentients.But even so, I feel extraordinary excitement at being in the midst of such living          plenty.And, indeed, I wonder briefly if we should stay in this place.Should we become this universes unseen, all powerful, cautiously          non meddling protector?So that when, one day, many years hence, the Death Ship arrives we will be here to greet it, and we          will be able to destroy it?We could save it all, Jak and I!All of it.With our intervention, one sole universe would survive!And one, surely, is enough?You want to be a god?Dont you?We fly between realities yet again.And enter yet another wilderness universe.Death has cursed this place, and only datacached fragments of the lost sentient          cultures remain.I have archived them.We must move on.And again, a universe devastated and devoid of life.And desolation, and lifelessness.And barren bleak voids.And nullness.And emptiness.And nothingness.And, again and again, in all these dead places, whispers remain: distress messages haunting the empty reaches of no space.The Death Ship has travelled further and for far longer than I ever suspected.I now realise they have killed millions; by which I do not mean millions of sentient creatures, nor do I mean millions of          different species of sentient creatures; I mean millions of universes.And again and again I find the last gasps of all these dying civilisations, desperately encoding all they knew and all that          they were into signals transmitted out into space.In the hope that one day, the messages might be found, and their own lost civilisation          would be remembered.We must honour them.We must remember them.And so we shall.EXPLORER 410: DATA ARCHIVE           LOG OF LOST CIVILISATIONS (Extract) Lost Civilisation: 41,200  sixteen messages were received from this universe.Fifteen were garbled.The sixteenth message told of a world of brilliant and eloquent sentient creatures who had built a tower that stretched from             the ground into space, until it connected to the planets moon.The tower was hollow and functioned as a tunnel; children             would climb up it then slide down it on their school holidays.No data about the material used to build the tower has been received, nor is there any information about the engineering principles             that allowed it to be stable.But many images have been saved of these people who built a staircase to their moon.These sentient beings had a median height of three bilois, and a median breadth of two bilois.They rolled on organic wheels.Their eyes were receptive to ultraviolet and infrared radiation.A large portion of their final message was devoted to a binary code transcription of their greatest works of music, which             I have translated into musical notes.It is rhythmic, ululating, and entirely captivating.Their greatest composer lived to             the age of four hundred and forty, even though the median age for these people is twenty.It is believed by the philosophers             among these sentients that the grandeur of his music sustained his life far beyond the normal span.That is why these creatures were so devoted to music; their entire culture was based around the concept that music prolongs             life, and can confer immortality.In their war with the Dreaded, these sentients transmitted continuous sound messages at the enemy spaceship in orbit.These             beams were not intended to damage the Death Ship; they merely conveyed a compressed form of these sentients greatest works             of music.Perhaps their hope was that their enemy would be so exalted at the beauty of the music that they would abandon the             battle.There is no data available as to whether the Dreaded approved of or were intimidated by the musical genius of these people.But it is self evidently the case that they did not cease in their battle.Once the Death Ship launched its attack, annihilation proceeded swiftly.These sentients inhabited four satellites and a single             D Type planet; their total population numbered forty two point one billion.The music of this species is gracious indeed.It takes some considerable effort to become attuned to the jagged rhythms and             discordant shrills, but it is this minds opinion that these creatures were possessed of a rare genius for melody, harmony,             and rhythmic variety.Their final elegycomposed as their planet broke asunder, and inserted as a coda to their distress messageis particularly             affecting.Lost Civilisation: 120,357 A fragment of a poem was retrieved, in an unfamiliar metrical style, which translates very roughly as:  SeashineMoonsbeamHeartsjoyFear of death Childs loveChilds joyChilds rageChilds death LoveHopeDelightDeath of love and hope and delight  No record exists of this civilisation or its physical form.Lost Civilisation: 1,264,303  as well as a text describing a sacred building:   and there the gods will dwell, in the hearts of those who live there, and who are purified by the stones, and by the bricks,                and by the mortar, and by the metal.Perfection will be achieved by those who are born and live and die in the sacred holy                of holies.Thus we believe and thus we have devoted our lives to this place.And yet we no longer have reason to believe that our gods care for us any more.Our houses have fallen, our temples have collapsed,                our animals are all dead.Only our people remain and they are without flesh because of some terrible event that has enplagued                our entire species in a moment; and now they are dying slowly by degrees.And thus we, the holy scribes who dwell in this                holy place, deep within the ground, see the end of all occurring through our cameras and mirrors and we know that soon, we                too, will [transmission interrupted]   Lost Civilisation: 2,200,304 A list of names, in a language based on whistles, here rendered in approximate phonics.[24 billion names in all] Lost Civilisation: 3,800,305 In this universe, a considerable data trail has been left from 5,444 sentient species all of whom were bonded empathetically             and existed in a state of harmony, even though they had evolved on 5,444 different planets from far distant regions of this             universe.Frequent mentions of the Gateway of Life may be a reference to a naturally occurring rift in space that permitted instantaneous             travel between these planets, allowing for the possibility of close interaction between species of very different cultural             development.A further reference to the Faint and Haunting Web of Minds also suggests the hypothesis that empathetic connection between             sentient beings may have occurred through the rift itself, implying that all these cultures had evolved with a dim but compelling sense of the existence of other minds in other places.An attempt to destroy the Death Ship was made by all 5,444 species acting in concert, by Webbing the Evil into a State of             Grace and Kindness, which implies an attempt to harness the power of empathy to redeem and de evil the marauding Death             Ship and its crew.This attempt evidently failed; the universe is now a ghost of possibilities; and no trace of the Gateway of Life or the Faint             and Haunting Web of Minds remains in the aridness of this once fertile and endlessly astonishing universe.Lost Civilisation: 5,900,300 The history of this civilisation is recorded as a 34,334,333 hour film archived here.The text which accompanies this film, which is approximately four billion words long, is archived here.For the purposes of this summary log, here is the opening paragraph:  We are defeated.You are the victors in this battle.And yet you know no mercy, and no respect; merely contempt.We have abased                ourselves before you and you have shown us contempt.We have enslaved ourselves to you and you have shown us contempt.We                have pledged ourselves to you, and you have shown us contempt.We have offered you our lands, our wealth, we have offered                to execute all our leaders and soldiers and leave only the civilians and the weaker sexes alive, and you have ignored us,                and hence shown your contempt.So let it now be understood: We damn you.We curse you.We invoke all the demons in the myriad demon dimensions to eat your                souls.We show our contempt for you, we shit on you, we piss on you, we eat you and shit you out then piss on you, we  [etc]  Lost Civilisation: 11,900,300 These sentients were biped and prided themselves on art generated by bioluminescent energy, and firework displays that sometimes             lasted for years.Relics left by this civilisation include the image of a map of the universe which shows a single planet at the centre of a             universe of stars, indicative of a pre technological society without sophisticated astronomical apparatus.This is at odds,             however, with certain fragments in the data trail, where there are references to colony ships settling multiple planets and             ruling the universe.These stories may of course be fictional, a legacy of a society that dreamed of settling the stars but never did so.This civilisation is unique in that there is no record of it having encountered the Death Ship prior to cessation of its reality.For an account of the end of this universe and surmises about its possible causes, read the files archived here and here.The second of these files consists of a long account by an artist from this civilisation called Minos which is of considerable             interest to this archive.It contains details of a war between his people and a species they called the Parakka; tall creatures             with a single eye and claws for hands and with three tongues which hiss when the creature speaks.The memoir begins with the             words:   Hate me if you like.I care not.Love and hate are just illusions.Death is the only truth.And I should have died a long time ago.I wish indeed that I had.For I have sought death; I have taken bold and reckless gambles; I and my crew have fought wars that we could not possibly                have won, and we have won.When I do eventually die, this voice recording will be left as a trace in the folds of space.It will be found, one day, by                some explorer ship or other.And my story will be known.The greatest story in the history of all the universes.So my words will live for ever, but I care not for that.I just want to die.This is why I am dictating this, my suicide note, my declaration of defeat.It is not clear what these last lines mean; the rest of the broadcast is partially corrupt, and is currently being studied             by Star Seeker Jak who for some reason takes a particular interest in the Parakka and in this lost civilisation and claims             he will one day be able to decipher the rest of the story.Sai ias My world was chaos.I had returned to the interior world from the hull bay to find the lake emptied of water, bodies strewn all around; and a          vast fissure stretching across the Great Plain.But gravity had been restored; and now the shattered bodies of the dead and          injured in the attack lay on the grass and savannah and in the muddy lake bed, rather than hovering in mid air as before.Sai ias.A flutter of wings by my head; Lirilla was still with me.Save me, Lirilla said, in acknowledgement of the fact I had saved her.Though she did not know why ; for she had no notion we had been friends for hundreds of years.Quipu?Fray?Doro?Are they safe?I asked.She knew the names of these beasts of course.And obediently, Lirilla vanished, and returned.Quipu, safe, she said.Fray?Doro?No Fray.No Doro.She had been around the ship and back in the blink of an eye; I knew she could not be wrong.Quipu was safe; but Doro and Fray were missing; fallen, or so I feared, through the crack in our world.Sai ias?said Lirilla anxiously.Im fine.Im fine.Lirilla, fear, full, said Lirilla.Youre safe, youre safe.Im here now.Lirilla, wish, dead.What are you saying sweet bird?Lirilla, wish, deadship.Me too.Me too.But the attack had failed; the Kaun were still alive.We spoke of it that night, Quipu and Lirilla and I, in the hours after the disaster; in a series of rambling and repetitive          dialogues.No need to ask who, said Quipu One.We know who.Some lost civilisation, added Quipu Two.Seeking revenge, added Quipu Three.From this universe or from some other universe?asked Quipu Four.The Quipus together intoned: We will never know.It must have pursued us, said Quipu Three, forwho knows how long.And yet it failed, Quipu One pointed out.It tried, at least, said Quipu Three.Theres grandeur in that.My own peoplewell.We were so powerful and yetwe Gone, said Quipu One, like a light being switched off; all our people, gone.Ground, healed?said Lirilla.For earlier that day the crevasse that had opened up in the grasslands slowly, over the space          of several hours, had closed.I do not know how that could have happened, admitted Quipu Four.Magic, I said.Not magic, contradicted Quipu Two.Some kind of force field effect.?said Quipu Five, who was struggling to keep up with the discussion.A structural skeleton made of invisible force, agreed Quipu Three.When the hull is breached, the force field rejoins; the metal is forced back into place.I touched it, I reminded Quipu, as I kept doing every few minutes.I touched the ship.And so we sat there, stunned, survivors of a disaster, huddled and muttering the same things over and over: It was terrible.We almost died.I cant believe it!and so on, endlessly.I touched it, I muttered again.My claws had scraped the hull of their vessel, before I had been scooped up by invisible          beams of force and made captive once again.I remembered the vast and awkward shape of the attacking ship; and its squat central hub, with its colourful stripes faded          by time; and the inscription on the top of the vessel, blazoning a name which, even in the absence of the translating air,          I had somehow been able to read, which said:        Explorer 410: Property of the Olara Trading Fleet.Explorer 410, said Quipu Two, Property of the Olara Trading Fleet.Yes, I confirmed.Not even a warship, said Quipu Three.A reconnaissance vessel, for a merchant fleet.And it was nearly our salvation.Nearly, I said.But why did the Kaun save you, Sai ias?asked Quipu One.They plucked you out of space; why you, and not any of the others?I do not know, I said.Over the next few days and nights, Quipu interrogated me at length; and pieced together the progress and nature of the space          battle.One or more of the missiles fired by the attacking spaceship had struck its target; that much could not be denied.And that          missile had ripped several holes in our hull, through which I, and Doro and Fray and so many others, had tumbled out.But the ship that I had seen that looked like a Helix was but an illusion.And thus, Quipu concluded, the Hell Ship that was destroyed before my eyes must have been illusion too.The cheapest of tricks, said Quipu One.A distortion of space time, added Quipu Two, that allowed an image to linger here when the reality had moved there.It was clear to all of us that Explorer 410: Property of the Olaran Trading Fleet had been duped by a conjurers stunt.If          only it had fought on, and fired more missiles, it might have succeeded in once again striking the invisible but real Hell          Ship; and the result of the battle would have been quite different.This thought haunted me.These aliens who attacked us had been so very close to victory.A single miscalculation had cost          them everything.A few weeks later Fray returned; though Doro did not.Once again, Frays memories were gone; and once again she was convinced her world had only just been destroyed.It was agonising to see the rawness of her pain.And painful too to witness her bewilderment when she was told of a great          space battle in which she had died, though she remembered nothing of it.Other fatalities of the battle were in the same plight; their bodies were intact, but they knew nothing of what had just happened.It was a whole army of new ones, all at the same time; and there was no way for me to ease them gently into their new world.As Cuzco would have said: they had to fly or die.Why did Doro not return?And was he actually dead?Perhaps that strange creature could actually survive in the depths of space?Perhaps he shifted his shape one final time, to be a star among stars?In the cycles that followed the failed attack on the Hell Ship, our world was in turmoil.Many angry creatures stalked the          interior world; duels and vicious assaults were commonplace.But I did not care; not any more.For my entire personality had changed.I was no longer calm, reassuring, and accepting.Instead, I was engulfed in a constant edgy rage.The smallest things infuriated me.I found that I could no longer tolerate the company of others.Even Quipu, even Lirilla,          enraged me by their very presence.After a while I stopped spending the nights in my cabin with my so called friends and their wretched fucking stories.Instead,          I slept outside, in the pitch black night, atop mountain crags or in the depths of the lake.And each dawn I re entered the world after a nights dark reverie of regrets.I thought about Sharrock a lot.I was convinced that if he and I had had acted sooner, our rebellion might have prevailed.With my strength, and his knowledge of warfare, we would have been an unstoppable team.Another missed opportunity.First Sharrock; then Explorer 410: Property of the Olaran Trading Fleet.Though these two failures did, I realised, prove the Kaun were not invulnerable.Indeed, as I had seen while floating in space, they were slight creatures, bipeds, with no natural armour.I could kill one          easily!I could snap its body in half and swallow it, and crunch its bones in the ridges of my gut which is robust enough,          if the mood takes me, to consume raw rock.These pathetic puny easily killed creatureshow could I ever have been afraid of such as they?Many cycles passed.The new ones were becoming acclimatised.The daily violence began to lessen.The Rhythm of Days was resumed,          though I took no part in it.A thousand more cycles passed.The ship was now restored.The lake was re filled.Our numbers were fewer, for not all the lost had been resurrected; but          we were still many.And I resumed my role in the Rhythm of Days.I explored.I listened to poetry and tales.I struggled to          comprehend science.I raced against my fellow sentients.I meditated.I refreshed old friendships, with friends who had forgotten          all our years together.And I made new friends as a trickle of new ones began to join us.I realised, with horror, that life had returned to normal.And then one night I slept a dreamless sleep.And when I woke I was no longer in the interior world.I was inside a spherical cargo hold of some kind.Grey metal walls surrounded me.And all around me, their bodies bare armed          and sweating, were twenty or more of the Kindred.They wore golden tunics of a kind I had never seen, and were testing pipe shaped weapons I did not recognise.A small cheer rose up when I          awoke, and I could tell it was intended mockingly.Where am I?I said; but no words emerged.I took a step forward; but I did not move.Show arms, my voice said, and the Kindred warriors stood upright and held their weapons at an angle to their bodies.We are, my voice added, facing an imposing enemy.These creatures have disreal technology and remote weaponry.We have          rarely fought an enemy of such sophistication.Do not be complacent.Yes, Captain, roared the Kindred, almost as one.My body was the commander of this army; and yet I had no control of it!I remembered what had happened when I killed Sharrock.It was just like this; this same experience.I had lost the power over          my own body.There was a Kaun in my head.The hull gates opened and I flew out of the ship, escorted by ten Kindred soldiers in space suit body armour.I was gliding through the blackness of space above a small green and blue planet, which blazed with artificial lights.I was          encased in some kind of protective shield, and wore a transportation device around my neck which made it possible for me to          travel large distances in an instant.So one moment I was far from the planet, seeing it as a distant balloon; and the next          I was close up to the orb, gripped by its gravitational forces.We were, I knew, without knowing how I knew, too small to register on the enemys detection devices.They were geared to spot          enemy spaceships, not individual soldiers and a caped sea creature able to breathe in vacuum.This is why the Kaun had saved me, I realised.They had discovered I could survive in space, during the battle with Explorer 410, and as a consequence they decided they would keep          my skills for a day like today.I landed on the blue and green planets moon in a gentle glide, and began digging into the ground with my claws.Then from          the pack on my back I removed a small cylindrical object.I buried it there, and glided through the thin atmosphere on to          another part of the same moon.I was joined soon by seven members of the Kindred, wearing their space armour and tanks of air; and they too had cylindrical          objects to bury.We planted nearly three hundred of them in widely spaced holes across the moons surface.Then I vanished/reappeared and found myself back in the hull of the Hell Ship itself.But I could still seethrough the eyes of the Kaun who possessed me and who was now seeing through the cameras the Kindred          had left behind, in an insane loop of perceptionthe remote war that was taking place in this stellar system.First, the moon on which I had stood abruptly exploded, raining debris into the clouds of its parent planet below.I could          only imagine the destruction that was being wrought on this fertile world.After a delay of some minutes, swarms of spaceships emerged from bases orbiting the planet to protect it from attack; but          they flew into some kind of invisible shield in space and were torn into pieces.This was another trap, laid by the Kindred.And then a huge finned missile appeared from nowherepresumably fired by the Hell Ship via a rift in spaceand reappeared          in the atmosphere of this blue and green planet.It soared through the atmosphere, like a bird on a downglide.Then there was a vast billowing explosion in the planets atmosphere, as vivid as a solar flare.And I realised the missile          had been detonated in mid air.The enemy were, I realised, fighting back.After the Hell Ships missile had been blown out of the sky, the aliens of the blue and green planet continued their spirited defence.Thin metal tubes flew out of the planets atmosphere          and expanded into flimsy winged spacecraft possessed of amazing velocity.There were hundreds of themno, thousandsand they          danced and kinked with eerie speed.I was awed at the scale and the beauty of this retaliation; rockets turned into Cagashflies          in front of my eyes and were now swarming out of the clouds.And then these dazzlingly fast craft broached the atmosphere and rushedrifting in huge jumpstowards the Hell Ship itself.And for a few exhilarating tens of minutes I savoured my panoramic space camera view of the Cagashfly spaceships sweeping          towards us.Then the Hell Ship counter attacked.Missiles appeared in space, rifted out of the Hell Ships belly; Cagashfly spaceships          exploded; and the battle escalated with a swiftness that made me nauseous.I could not perceive any details of the space war;          just ceaseless and immense flashes of light as the explosions built upon explosions in a frenzy of light and spewed energy.And then, after what seemed an eternity of light war, the flow of Hell Ship missiles came to a halt.And the dazzling glare          slowly faded, and the stars began to reappear.But a few moments later still I could see that the swarm was still coming towards us.And there were now more of them than there had been before; the Cagashfly spaceships were mysteriously multiplying as they were destroyed.I marvelled at          this, briefly.And wondered how these creatures could manage such a trick.And then I realised: these Cagashfly ships were now rifting through space like stones bouncing upon a lake, spitting energy          beams at us, getting closer and closer with each        The Hell Ship lurched.And I looked around, and I realised that the stars in the space around me had changed, and the hazy          after glare left by those countless explosions had vanished entirely.The Hell Ship had fled the scene of battle.I realised that the Kaun had been thwarted, and had given up.It was a shock to discover that the Kaun did not always win.I had thought them invulnerable in battle, as they had been          in the war with my people.On the next occasion however I was able to witness the destruction of an entire planet, as the Kaun ship fired the same large          finned missile which this time broke through the enemys defensive weapons and struck the planets crust.Once again I saw everything that happened through the mind that possessed my eyes, and which saw through remote cameras all          that took place.And I not only saw; I understood, through my intimate bond with my possessing mind.I grasped everything; how the weapon was          constructed, how it worked, what it did.I knew that this missile was designed to drill a path to the planets core, where          un matter was then released which collided with the hot liquid matter of the planets core to create a series of huge blasts          that, before my Kaun inhabited eyes, ripped the planet apart.The Kaun who dwelled in my head had a name for this weapon: the planet buster.This was the same weapon that had killed my world.But, I now knew, if we had possessed the right technology, we could have          stopped it.That was, for me, a bitter moment of insight.The wars continued.And the Kaun continued to ride me like his beast of burden.And I continued to watch, and watch, as planet          after planet fell.The Kaun were remorseless, but they lost as often as they won.But when they did win, their wrath and their cruelty knew no bounds.And all too often, Ior rather my bodywas the leader of the giant sentients who took part in their massive ground offensives against bipeds and smaller polypods.These poor creatures          were justly awed at our ferocious aspect; and we slew them in their thousands.And for the first time, I truly understood the reality underlying the rhythm of our lives.For whilst we on the interior world          were spending our days in tedious repetition, the Kaun were laying plans and setting up war weaponry.They seeded energy          beacons in hundreds of stars to fuel their war machine.They created machines in space that generated robot warriors and robot          spaceships to comprise their battle fleet.They reconnoitred carefully all the systems they were going to attack.And only          then, did they fight.The wars were brief; but the preparation for those wars was intense and prolonged.As for meI had become one of the Vanished.For months, then years, I did not return to the interior world.I spent all my          days with the Kauns other warriors.The Kindred were the Kauns regular army, alternating soldiers on a regular basis to          keep the troops fresh.And these Kindred were masters of warfare, and shockingly brutal.And, meanwhile, we giant sentients were there to shock and appal and to engage in the most bloodthirsty of the combats.The          wars could have been won without us; but we were there to add glory and magnificence to the combats.We were unlike the Kindred of course.They chose to fight.Whereas we giant sentients were without volition, controlled like puppets by the Kaun.Thus, oblivious to the          desperate protests of our minds and souls, our bodies murdered and massacred like evil savages.And, every now and then, we were joined by familiar faces.My troops awaited my instructions; I scanned them carefully, looking for traces of fear or of independent thought.A hundred          Kindred warriors stood with me in the hull, together with eleven giant sentients.Balach, Morio, Tamal, Sheenam, Goay, Leirak,          Tarrroth, Shseil, Dokdrr, Ma.And Cuzco.I wanted to scream with joy when I saw him; but I could not.I also wanted to savagely wrap a tentacle around his throat and          strangle him, in revenge for what he did to Sharrock and the other rebels.But I could not.I was a prisoner in my own mind;          able to see but not to act.Cuzco looked magnificent.His orange scales gleamed, his eyes were full of an angry vitality.He was no longer the sad and          defeated creature I had loved; he was a warrior lost in battle lust.Cuzco, my voice said, these creatures have primitive projectile weapons and use spears and mechanical spear throwers.You          will enjoy today.Can they fly?Cuzco asked.They command, my voice said, regiments of aerial creatures who routinely massacre beasts larger than yourself.These people,          let us call them the Shasoon, which in my language means Prey We Taunt Before We Eat, will give you a battle royal.Cuzco roared with joy, as did Balach, Morio, Tamal, Sheenam, Goay, Leirak, Tarrroth, Shseil, Dokdrr, Ma, and myself.The Kaun strategy, I now knew, was to engage in direct combat only when the enemy was technologically primitive.And in these          cases, we were the Kauns favoured warriors; the giant sentients who could be relied upon to stage a battle both bloody and          magnificent.Ah, and what a battle it was!The Shasoon were octopod creatures who could gallop on four legs while firing spear weapons with their dextrous four arms.Their torsos stood upright atop their cylindrical bodies and they howled when they fought, an ululating cry that allowed them to control the animals and the plants in their vicinity.They were brave and bloodthirsty creatures, with a rich history of combat, as I learned from the thoughts in the mind of my          equally bloodthirsty Kaun master.The Shasoon had slaughtered all the other major land animals on this planet indiscriminately,          and fought constant wars amongst themselves.They were gifted astronomers and had spotted our space ship arriving in their          stellar system.And they had prepared carefully for an alien invasion, by laying traps, training armies, and concealing missiles          capable of throwing vast balls full of explosive powder, albeit for a relatively short distance.They stood, of course, not a chance.First Cuzco appeared in the skies above them and fusillades of burning spears were loosed at him from machines built of wood.But the spears splashed harmlessly over his armoured body, and he swept down low and ripped apart Shasoon warriors.Flames          were fired at him and engulfed his body but that merely entertained him and he spat back fire from his neck and skull vents.Nets were thrown upon him and he burned them off with acid from his body.And then I swooped down, my cape fully unfurled, and I landed in the midst of a regiment of Shasoon who fired primitive projectile          guns at me and stabbed me with their spears.And I batted them down with my lengthy tentacles, and impaled them with my quills,          and ripped their bodies apart with my claws.Then Goay and Leirak joined the fray; they were carried down in the claws of the giant aerial Tarrroth, and dropped on the          earth, where they used their claws to rip open the soil in search of the Shasoons buried encampments.And when the network          of tunnels were revealed, Dokdrr and Ma were conveyed to the planets surface and they slithered their vast serpent bodies          inside the tunnels and I know they would not stop until they had paralysed or chewed to pieces each and every Shasoon warrior          in this sprawling underground labyrinth.Once we had destroyed all of the warriors in this army, we travelled onwards to the countrys major city where we were confronted          with a fortified building with high walls that towered up to the clouds.But Tarnal swiftly smashed a path through the walls          and Cuzco flew inside billowing flame while I clambered over the wrecked walls with my tentacles and we resumed the perpetration          of carnage.These valiant warriors fought fearlessly, and in turn were dealt terrible blows, and sustained appalling injuries.Tarnal          had his eyes gouged out and ran off howling, lashing with his claws at air.A mob of Shasoon forced an explosive ball down          the throat of Dokdrr, and when it detonated the serpentines body was rent into pieces and she screamed in agony and could          no longer move.But then Tarrroth swept down from above and carried clawfulls of struggling Shasoon warriors high up in the          air and dropped them to their deaths.Shsiel and Ma had been my friends on the Hell Ship; I remembered them fondly.Ma was a herbivore with a long and (proportionate          to her body) slender neck that allowed her to eat leaves from the tops of trees in the giant forests of her world.Her people          had developed a rich philosophy, and her stories of the fantastical had always been a joy to hear.And Shsiel was a scaled          two headed beast whose people had befriended the sentient bipeds on their planet, and formed a multi species civilisation          with a single government.These were the gentlest of beasts, despite their size.But today they were wrathful warriors.And when we smashed down the          inner walls of the fortified building we found there the old and the young Shasoon cowering, and the babes in cots, the crippled          and the ailing, the venerable leaders, and the terrified toddlers; all protected by ranks of archers fighting fiercely to          the last.And Ma roared with joy at the sight and lashed at bodies with her hooves and ate young and old and crippled Shasoon          whole, and Shseil used his horns to stab and his teeth to rip the octopods into shreds.Then I joined them on the ground and          I I cannot speak of it.Suffice to say, we slew them all!We butchered, chewed, maimed, ripped, burned and impaled these angry Shasoon by the tens          of thousand.The hot blood of battle was upon me; I was fighting side by side with giant sentients of magnificent valour,          and blood flowed freely that day!All this I saw, and all these emotions I felt, as I inhabited the Kaun mind that was inhabiting me.It was a day of bloody          murder, and my Kaun revelled in it.And so did the Kaun who controlled Cuzco, and so did all the other Kauns who controlled          this army of giant sentients.This was not a day for the Kindred; this was a day for monsters to kill small eight limbed angry          and aggressive intelligent beings who stood not a chance.They could hurt us, but they could not kill us; all they could do          was die screaming with rage.Yet in my own soul, I raged with frustration, and with contempt for my inhabiting mind.For what glory was this?How could          any sentient creature take pleasure in such cruel, futile atrocities?The Shasoon were flawed creatures, without doubt; they were a young species, and primitive and bloodthirsty.They had not          yet learned the joys of civilisation, collaboration, and societal love.But they had potential; their cities were beautiful, they loyalty to each other was noteworthy, and they had, I do not doubt, great love for their          children and for each other.But we slaughtered them that day as if they were insects who had built their nest in our childs bedroom; and when the Kaun          were weary we departed and a planet buster missile was sent to burrow into the planets core.One solitary Shasoon was captured; and we made him watch, through the glass wall of the hull, as his planet was exploded into          many pieces.He screamed and wailed, as they all did on these occasions.And then he was taken away to the interior world.When we did not fight, we slept.We woke, we fought again.Cuzco, I whispered.The great beast was asleep.Cuzco.Still, he slept, not moving, not even a trace of breath from his lips.Cuzco!Still, he did not stir.No one stirred; for all we giant sentients, sleep was absolute and involuntary.But for some unknown reason, I had woken, and remained awake.And I could speak.But Cuzco could not hear me; his trance like          state could not be penetrated.I called and whispered and blew air upon his face, but he did not respond in any way.Eventually I was silent.I lay awake, incapable of movement, unable to speak to anyone else; never have I felt more trapped.They are giants also, roared Cuzco, as he hovered in mid air at the head of his army.It is a worthy encounter.Let battle          commence!And Cuzco plunged and dived upon the basking reptilian creatures, each twice his size, and I loped along on my tentacles to          join him.We were on a swamp planet; double suns made the air a painful glare.These creatures were non sentient but vicious, and Cuzco          was enjoying the battle.Blood spattered and heads were severed and after several minutes Cuzco was maimed and weak and I          came roaring in to help him.Cuzco, I whispered, my face close to his bleeding head.Can you hear me?I can hear you, he whispered back, then his eyes went blank again and he fell asleep.The reptile tried to rip his body apart; and I stood and fought, to protect Cuzcos sleeping body.I realised that Cuzcos          Kaun body rider had absented himself; and indeed so had mine.For I had at that moment, for the first time in a year or more,          the use of my limbs back; I was free!But Cuzco was in deadly peril.So I fought for my friend like a crazed thing, spitting rage and stabbing with my quills and          slashing with my claws.I pounded the enemy beasts with my tentacles; and I defeated them all.And when it was over, I was weary and bloodied, and Cuzco still slept, and I wondered what I would do now.Well done, Sai ias, said a voice in my head, and I realised it was my Kaun.He was talking to me.Cuzcos wrecked body was carried up in a landing craft and taken to the Hell Ship.He would be restored to health, I knew,          but it would be some time before I saw him again.I recognised one of the Kindred landing party; it was Zala.Once she had been Sharrocks enemy, and had fought him on his          world.And now once again she was serving the Kaun.Zala, I whispered to her, Its me, Sai ias.But she did not respond.She is a beautiful creature, said the voice in my head.Or at least, I find her so.Larger, physically, than the females of my kind.And three eyes at the front, whereas our third             eye is on the back of our neck.But beautifully proportioned.I have often, in the body of a Kindred male, fornicated with             this beast.Who are you?I thought at the voice in my head.But there was no response.It was, once again, a slaughter most bloody and glorious.On this day, I fought side by side with the Kindred, against tusked bipeds who had built huge metal machines to fight their          battles for them.The Kindred were armed with their cylinder guns that spat fire, and I and a dozen other giant sentients          fought beside them with our claws and teeth and, in my case, tentacles.First, we had destroyed the tuskers cities with bombs from the air; we had smashed their missiles in their silos; we had          slain them in their hordes.This was a semi technological society which used steam to power its machinery; and their projectile          weapons fired only one bullet before requiring a reload.But even so, the tuskers had large and well disciplined armies and          catapults that could hurl burning fire, and there were millions of them.So we slew millions of them, remotely, with missiles          and forest fires.And now we had descended to the planet for hand to hand combat with the last stragglers on the planet; no more than two or          three thousand of them, we estimated.And we were losing.The tusked bipeds used ambush and deceit against us; they built pits and covered them with grass; they          put bombs in their own people so when a Kindred warrior struck an enemy warrior with his sword, the resulting blast was deadly          to both.And their metal machines were unbeatable.I stabbed them with my quills, I smashed them with my tentacles, but they could          not be hurt.And every time they burned me with fire, my inner shell got weaker.
