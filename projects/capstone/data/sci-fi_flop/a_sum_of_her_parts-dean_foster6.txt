I never know which way to jump.He gestured anew.She was unconscionably gratified to see that his arm was pointed in the same direction she had been preparing to go when shed thought he had run out on her.Might as well jump that way.Without a map, directions, or GPS we dont have much choice.Or we have a wealth of choices.Depends on how you want to look at it.His eyes met hers.Now getting to Nerens is about more than finding out whats on the thread.Now its about finding food and water.His eyes widened.You still have the thread, dont you?She started.In all the confusion and confliction she hadntReaching inside her shirt she felt for the small storage compartment that had been sewn into the inside of the left cup of her brassiere.After a moments searching, the tips of her fingers closed around an unyielding cylinder.Finding the storage capsules seal intact she let out a sigh of relief.Still here.He exhaled with relief.For a moment there all I could think of was having to dig through a few dozen square meters of sand with my bare hands in search of something smaller than a finger joint.He gestured at the debris strewn ground.Lets see if theres anything else we can salvage.His grin returned, crooked as ever.At least if we get hit with another sandstorm we wont have to worry about losing all our supplies.Because you already surrendered some to the flood, and me to the storm.Heck of a way to lighten a pack.Cant argue with that logic.She made herself smile back at him.You cant lose what youve already lost.They searched the immediate surroundings for nearly half an hour without finding anything.The sand had taken everything except his first aid kit.He was glad to still have it.The sand had nearly taken her companion.She was glad to still have him.HIKING THROUGH HEAVILY ERODED hills instead of across a flat plain offered more opportunities to keep under cover and away from the prying eyes of any company searcher drones.It also offered shade from a sun burning through a cloudless sky.But it also made for slower going.Ironically, in a world awash in helpful electronics they now found themselves navigating by the light in the sky.It helped that both of them had poured over Ouspels map and instructions so many times that much of it remained in memory, though they no longer had a communicator with which to confirm their decisions.They did not speak of what would happen if they missed Nerens entirely and continued trudging northward.Beyond the SICK company outpost there were no towns or scientific stations, and the eastwest road (the only eastwest road) that connected the towns of Lderitz and Keetmanshoop was farther from Nerens than the SICK facility was from Orangemund.Miss their target destination and they would surely die in the desert.Even in the most complex world, she reflected as she marched alongside Whispr, life could ultimately be reduced to simplicities.Actually, there was a simple way to avoid getting lost.All they had to do was head west until they hit the sea and then turn north.But with company diamond mining sites scattered all along the coast and Nerens being supplied from the sea, the chances of approaching the facility undetected via a coastal route was essentially zero.They had no choice but to try to sneak in from the wide open east.From the desert where no one ventured except fools and the deluded.Which am I?she wondered.Recently she had told others that she was a scientist.Plenty of fools and the deluded belonged to that profession.Surreptitiously she eyed her slender companion as he trod silently beside her.At least Whispr harbored no such illusions.He was here for the promise of subsist and nothing more.His ruminations were not troubled by elevated hopes.In a way, she envied him.There was something to be said for the peace conveyed to the soul by a complete lack of curiosity.Worry was being pushed into the background by weariness as they topped a low rise and a sheltered riverbed came into view.They had encountered and crossed many such, but this one was strikingly different.For one thing, it was preponderantly green instead of brown and yellow.Not for the full length of its meandering course, nor heavily so.But there was tall brush, and clusters of reeds, and even a few scattered ivory palms lording it over lesser desert vegetation.A trio of distinctive ungulate shapes with towering horns paused to stare in the direction of the new arrivals before breaking into a gallop for the nearest ridge.As the two tired travelers watched, the three gemsbok disappeared over the rocky crest, still moving at a lazy trot as they vanished.Conferring, Ingrid and Whispr agreed that this little desert paradise was one of the last main water holes that had been marked on Ouspels map.I even remember the damn name.Whispr had to restrain himself from plunging headlong toward the inviting garden.Kokerboom Oasis.Then were not far from Nerens.Her reply was tinged with barely controlled excitement.Thats right.We can look forward to being taken prisoner any day now.He was licking his lips as they descended the slope on which they had been standing and started across the soft sand and gravel of the largely dry river bottom.Ive already decided what I want for my last meal.Assuming SICK allows the condemned a last meal.The sight of water oozing out of the sands among the greenery was so inviting that she determined to forgo the dubious pleasure of arguing with him.It formed a pool, not a river, but in the absence of humankind the water was clean and potable.The sensation of it sliding down her throat was indescribable.No liquid derived from a waterpak could taste half so sweet.As soon as she had drank her fill she laboriously removed her boots and self inflating socks, rolled the legs of her pants up to her knees, found a suitable rock, and plunged her limbs into the water.It was just deep enough to allow her toes to touch bottom.Curious centimeter long silvery fish, an amazing presence in so remote a place, finned over to investigate the pale sausagelike intruders that had immersed themselves in their isolated paradise.She looked toward her companion.Wiping the last invigorating droplets from his lips, Whispr was gazing into the high reeds as he unlimbered his backpack.Why dont you come and join me?she urged him.Itll lower your body temperature and in ten minutes youll feel like youve spent a weekend in Bermuda.Thought I heard something, he muttered.She shook her head sadly.Whisprs perpetual state of watchfulness had certainly helped him survive a range of dangerous situations, but it also made it impossible for him to relax.What could you have heard?Theres nothing here.She gestured at their gardenlike surroundings.The oryx have gone.Although I suppose there could be reptiles.Lizards or snakes.She kicked her feet back and forth, splashing the cool, soothing liquid.I dont even care if its a viperIm willing to share and Im not moving.Someone moaned.Her stated resolve immediately forgotten, Ingrid scrambled to slip back into her boots and socks.Advancing cautiously, a bent over Whispr had entered the reeds and was moving in the direction of the sound.By the time Ingrid was back on her feet the moan had been repeated.Louder, and larded with words unknown to her.But from the country research she had done prior to disembarking in Cape Town she thought she recognized the language.The clicks and glottal stops were too distinctive to be anything other than the language of the original indigenous inhabitants of the Southern African desert.Then they found the creature and she thought she was mistaken.Until it spoke again.Lying panting and bleeding among the reeds was the most radical Meld Ingrid had ever seenso extreme that at first she thought it was an antelope or some other small four legged creature that had been magified to look human.Only as she moved slowly closer was she able to see for certain that it was a maniped human being.Even Whispr, who had encountered some truly radical melds in Savannahs underground, was taken aback.What lay before them was more than the usual cosmetic manipulation.The how of it was not in question.The why of it left them utterly bewildered.Looking up at them, the creaturethe person, Ingrid corrected herselfgasped a pair of sentences in her peculiar click tongue.In the middle of her speech and without warning she abruptly switched over to English.You are notcompany?No.Now that her professional as well as personal instincts were aroused Ingrid felt no compunction about moving closer.Wereexplorers.We mean you no harm.Dark doe eyes widened and the feminine voice strengthened slightly.You are notSICK security?Hell no, Whispr assured her.We dont want to see them any more than you do.Ingrid was kneeling beside the injuredwoman.Long bloody gashes streaked her left leg and buttock (haunch?).She wore very little, no more than the equivalent of a bikini top and a short skirt.But the dark fabric was synthetic tough.It imitated animal hide but had not been fashioned from it.What happened to you?Without giving the woman time to answer she added, My name is Ingrid.This is my friend and traveling companion, Whispr.As she reached toward the nearest gash the woman Meld pulled away.Be at ease, relax.Ingrid smiled.Im a doctor.A real doctor.Doctor?Her puzzling condition notwithstanding, the woman had a right to be surprised at encountering a self proclaimed physician out in the middle of nowhere.Yes, a doctor.Ingrid adopted her professional mien.Now, what happened to you?I was gathering certain plants.Medicinal plants that grow along the river.I remember coming here to drink.Raising her head slightly she nodded upstream.Leopard, he also came to drink at the same place, at the same time.He surprised me.I surprised him.We argued.A hint of a shy smile appeared on the dark sweat stained face.Leopard always win that argument.But youre still here, Whispr observed admiringly.Youre still alive.A slight nod.He struck at me out of surprise.I fought back.Reaching down, she touched her waistband and Ingrid saw a leather sheath.It was empty.Mr.Leopard, he now wears my knife.Convinced she was not about to be shot or arrested, she struggled to sit up.I am called !Nisa.Her name began with a sharp click of tongue against palate.Easygo easy.Putting an arm behind the young woman to support her, Ingrid looked back at Whispr.First aid kit.He nodded and disappeared back into the brush.Cleanser was followed by antibiotic.As she applied sprayskin from Whisprs kit Ingrid was afraid the small travel bottle would run out before she could close the last of the leopards wounds, but there was just enough to complete the work to her satisfaction.He regarded her efforts disapprovingly as she set the empty container aside.Nothing left for us.The Ingrid Seastrom who replied was not the same Dr.Ingrid Seastrom who had left Savannah weeks ago.Her response was curt.So dont get cut.Anyway, if somebody shoots you, a travel dispenser of spray isnt going to close the wound.How reassuring, he grumbled.Prognosis is all part of my job.No extra charge.Im starting to sound like him, she thought a little wildly.Bracing herself, she got both arms under the injured womans shoulders.Can you stand?A pause, then, Yes, I can stand.With the doctors help !Nisa proceeded to rise from where she had been lying.Ingrid initially thought the womans back locked on her when she was halfway erect.Then, as she stepped clear, she saw that the woman actually was standing.She just wasnt standing like a normal human.Or even like a normal Meld.She was standing on all fours.In that posture the full extent of her radical meld became clear.Her wrists had been maniped so that the heel of each hand was hardened like a hoof.While still as prehensile as ever, both hands could also serve to support the womans upper body as efficiently as any feet.As for the latter, the ankles had been broken, radicalized, bone ladled, and reset so that both feet faced permanently forward.!Nisas legs had been strengthened and every muscle tuned and maximized for running.Her hip joints had been swiveled (that was the only way Ingrid could think of them considering how they were presently positioned).The neck had also been strengthened, given a greater backward arc, and lengthened like that of a melded runway model.As she contemplated the remarkable reworking of the womans body Ingrid wondered if it was even capable of standing erect anymore.No Meld she had ever seen or even read about had been maniped to this extreme.Had she first encountered !Nisa from behind she would have thought she was looking at an animal.It wasnt just an animal meld, either.Those were to be found aplenty.Standing before her was an earnest attempt to reimagine a human being as a full fledged quadruped.It was an extraordinary example of the biosurges art.The next step, she supposed, would be to try a complete reversal of bipedal evolution.Why?she heard herself ask.Why do you look like this?Who made you look like this?There is a fine clinic in Gaborone.Twisting her head and neck completely around, !Nisa leaned back and showed that she was as capable as any antelope of nibbling on her bruised and damaged hip.We own it.My people.It is to enable us to be more of what we have always been.Leaving the treated wounds, she looked up at her new friends.We are the San.The people of the desert.Are you saying, an aghast Whispr asked her, that there are others like you?We are the San, !Nisa replied simply.One day we are all to become like this.She turned.Come and I will show you.When they hesitated she kicked out with a handor was it a foreleg?Comeare you afraid?She cast a meaningful glance skyward.It is day and we are exposed here.Would you rather go with me or with a company drone?After recovering their backpacks Whispr and Ingrid followed the remarkableand unsettlingMeld upriver.!Nisa explained as they followed the slow flowing stream that often vanished into the sands.For a long time my people were mocked, derided, even hunted by those who invaded our ancestral territories.White, blackit made no difference.All looked down on and despised the San.Before the advent of the SAEC, the last tribe country that ruled this land tried for many years to make the San live only in cities or on reservations.Neither is for San.In cities we die.On reservations we cry.But like thisand she gestured down at her bent over, four legged selfwe can try.Always the San have lived in these deserts, the Namib and the Kalahari.We live here still.But to live as in days of old we no longer can.Always we have been told by others that we must change.So we change.She grinned.But not as others would have us change.This time, these days, we decide on how to change!Over the course of the next several hours Ingrid and Whispr were forced to do more actual climbing and scrambling than they had since leaving Savannah.Despite the injuries she had incurred from the claws of the leopard, the tumbled boulders and awkward heights proved no obstacle to !Nisa.Traveling on all fours with greatly maniped leg muscles, she had no difficulty leaping from one ledge to the next.Patient with her charges and ignoring Whisprs constant cursing, she led them up a side canyon and away from the main river.Still wondering if so severe a Meld was capable of standing on two legs, Ingrid got her answer when they were confronted by a pair of young men who seemed to materialize out of the rocks that flanked both sides of the trail.Though equally as radically maniped as their guide, they stood on their hind legs.They also held rifles in their melded fingers.His hands rising reflexively into the air, Whispr nodded at the nearest gun.I suppose youre going to tell me thats a traditional San weapon?!Nisa spoke to the guards in her own remarkable language.They promptly lowered their weapons.We are traditionalists, she told Whispr.Not fools.Now advancing escorted by the pair of guards they continued upward into the foothills.Unable to hold their weapons and proceed on all fours, the two men had slipped the rifles into long woven holsters slung across their backs.What do you need guns for?Ingrid asked curiously.Out here, in this empty place?The desert is only empty to those who do not know how to look.Because we are again become one with the Namib does not mean we must feed ourselves with bows and arrows.Had I brought my own gun with me I could have dealt better with the leopard and would not have needed your help.But then you would not be seeing this place now.Sitting back on her haunches she gestured ahead.The hanging canyon was a small paradise high up in the foothills.Where the slope flattened out, the winding trickle of a tributary they had been following expanded to form multiple pools.Surrounded by high rock on all sides, the little valley boasted a surprising amount of vegetation.Traditional hunter gatherers, the San did not farm the well watered soil.Nor did they erect or have need of structures.Caves and overhangs provided ample shelter.Their lifestyle did not demand a full reversion to ancient times, however.Traditional culture had its limits.Sheets of amorphous solar cells colored to match and blend with the surrounding terrain provided power.Small camouflaged satellite pickups allowed for the reception of the same vit programming one would find in Cape Townor for that matter, Savannah.Noiseless refrigeration allowed food to be stored and kept despite the extremes of temperature experienced in the Namib.Concealed in a large cave near the back of the community were not one but two veiled floaters.In Sperrgebeit this kind of formal settlement is quite illegal, of course.!Nisa pointed out one surprise after another as she led her guests through the village.Nearly naked children broke away from monitors and projections that depicted everything from courses in advanced desert zoology to linguistics and floater mechanics in order to gape at the strangers.!Nisa continued to enlighten her two visitors.Those of us who have permission to live outside developed areas have reclaimed and been granted traditional parts of the Kalahari and the Namib.Our ecologically sound communities make no imposition on the animal preserves and offer educational and recreational facilities for tourists who wish to experience the desert regions and learn about our history and way of life.Her tone hardened.But other lands that have always been home to our people are officially off limits.Sperrgebeit is one such place.As you can see, it has not stopped us from resettling territory where our ancestors once roamed freely.Whatll you do if company security finds this place?A young girl offered Whispr a biodegradable plastic glass full of fruit juice.Finding it surprisingly cold, he downed it greedily.We will argue for our rights to remain here.Do not let either our melded appearance or our choice to live with as little clothing as possible fool you.In addition to the best biosurges, we have fine solicitors on our payroll.And if we cannot win rights to live in places such as this legally, we are ready to fight for what we believe belongs to us.Using the back of a skeletal hand to wipe fruit pulp from his mouth, Whispr shook his head sadly.You cant win a pitched battle with the SAEC.He indicated the idyllic surroundings.One armored floater full of company mercenaries would take this whole valley out.!Nisa nodded.From a military standpoint you right.Raising a hand off the ground, she gestured toward a well concealed cluster of antennae.But it would all be broadcast, live and worldwide.We have excellent uplink facilities here.Resulting outrage would be very bad for the company.So we have a number of weapons with which to fight.Meanwhile we live here quietly, peacefully, and undiscovered as we honor the ways of our ancestors.On reaching adulthood, many of children you see here will go off to soches in the cities to learn how to live and interact with other people, Naturals as well as Melds.Not all will choose return.But enough will come back to live as I do in order to maintain connection that we have worked hard to reestablish with the land and with our traditions.Exhausted from the climb, Ingrid looked around for a place to sit down.Arriving out of nowhere a teenager with a collapsed chair approached her, sat back, unfolded the chair, and invited her to relax.Murmuring a thank you she lowered herself onto the supportive fabric.Clearly she, Whispr, and their interaction with !Nisa was being studied.When her companion requested similar seating, a second chair was quickly provided.Now then.Settling herself back on her haunches and idly licking a hand foot with her melded tongue, !Nisa confronted her guests beneath the shade of the massive stone overhang where they were sitting.Ingrid noted that the two armed lookouts who had escorted them uphill had recently been joined by two similarly equipped older men.You must tell me what brought you to this place where no one comes.We did tell you, Ingrid began.Were explorers who !Nisa raised the hand she had been cleaning.Please, doctor.You are too far from anywhere and too lightly equipped to be engaged in desert exploration.Fools do not deceive the company on a daily basis, and we San are not fools.I indebt to you for treating my wounds and for helping me, but not to extent of endangering all that we have made here.Leaning forward, seated on her haunches, and resting foot hands on the ground, she embodied both sheep and shepherd in a single vision.What are you doing in the Sperrgebeit?Her tone and her expression hinted that further obfuscation on the part of the visitors might result in a serious downgrading of the hospitality they had so far been shown.So despite Whisprs frantic eye rolling and gesturing Ingrid proceeded to tell their host the truth.By the time she had concluded the story, her attenuated companion was on the verge of passing out from frustration.But !Nisa looked satisfied.That is an extraordinary tale.Too extraordinary to be an invention, I think.You actually want to get into Nerens?Ingrid nodded vigorously, but their host still found it hard to believe.Not for diamonds, but to learn what lies on a single storage thread you have bring with you?Once more Ingrid gestured affirmatively.You might maybe get in, one of the armed men standing on four legs behind her commented, but you never get out again.Twisting around she looked back at the speaker.Theyre our lives.Its what we choose to do, no matter how crazy it sounds.She turned back to !Nisa.Of all people the San should appreciate that.You argue plausible.We will let you go.Right.Whispr was on his feet fast.But Ingrid hesitated.Can you help us?Help us to get inside the facility?If we can just get past perimeter security I think I can convince any workers we meet that we belong there.I am a doctor.People, even those who are usually suspicious, tend to believe what doctors say.People like me?!Nisa smiled, then turned serious again.This Nerens we are talking about.Is true my people have no love for the company, or its minions, or the constant patrols whose attention we work to avoid.But at same time I see no compelling reason why we should risk even one of our own to assist you on what is plainly insane desire to sacrifice yourselves on altar of SICK security.Where have I heard that sentiment expressed before?Whispr muttered under his breath.Ingrid mustered all the determination she could.!Nisa, youre proud of your children, of how they go out into the world to get a proper social education and then, how some of them at least, return to adopt again your traditional way of life.Well, I happen to know that someone or something connected to this thread and to SICK is doing things to young people.To young adults who have suffered through bad melds.Its possible even some young San might be among those who have received certain unauthorized nano implants.The men behind her moved closer.Several other villagers who had paused to watch came nearer.Had they been listening all along?Nothing in this place, she reflected, was half as primitive as first appeared.She rushed on.I dont know what these implants do.I do have reason to believe that theyre connected to the thread somehow because both the thread and the implants are made of the same unique material.We believe that the material, and maybe also the thread and the implants, originate or at least are worked on at a secret research facility in Nerens.Nerens all about diamond mining, put in an older man who had just wandered over.Nothing else there.No, Ingrid corrected him firmly.The diamond mining may be real, but I believe its a cover for this facility.My friend and I have dedicated ourselvesWhispr made a rude noise but was ignoredto getting inside this place and learning what the thread and the implants are all about.Maybe youre rightmaybe we wont get outanother distinctive nonverbal comment arose from her companionbut weve come a very long way through very difficult circumstances to try.She sat back.Wont youcant youhelp us?If not for our sake then for those of the children whose futures are somehow being tampered with.An older woman standing behind !Nisa spoke up.By now quite a crowd had gathered around the visitors and their guide.How do you know that is happening?You just admit that you dont know what these implants do.Youre right, I dont, Ingrid confessed.But I do know that people operating out of benevolent motives dont put unauthorized devices into the brains of unknowing young people who are just trying to get bad cosmetic work fixed.Devices that vanish when anyone tries to study them.If these implants are intended to do good, why would those who install them do so secretly and without notifying the patient?And SICK behind this?Sensing the mood change in her growing audience and not wishing to have to parse her explanation, Ingrid simply nodded agreement.Several older villagers moved to consult quietly with !Nisa.Whispr and Ingrid could only wait in hopeful silence as their hosts debated her request.Would they risk exposure of their little paradise to assist a couple of lost strangers, even if they believed that the intentions of the two Namericans were benign?Or would they force them back down to the desert floor and turn them loose to be discovered by company security?It had been a while since she and Whispr had been at the complete mercy of others and it was not a sensation Ingrid enjoyed revisiting.When finally the conference broke up and the elders wandered off without so much as looking in the visitors direction, she could not help but wonder if her request had even been discussed.!Nisa quickly resolved her uncertainty.Wherever the company establish an enterprise it likes to be able to say that it provides jobs for locals.Often these are low level, low paying positions.At Nerens some of these are always reserved for the San.Hiring some of us make them look good.Sometimes San employees sent to Cape Town to provide reassuring vitops for visiting media.Turning to her left she strained to see deeper into the village.So someone have gone to fetch Gwi.For the first time in a very long while the normally pessimistic Whispr felt a tickle of sanguinity.This Gwi personthis is someone who has actually worked inside Nerens?!Nisa nodded.The research division of which you speak may be unknown to outside world, but is hard to keep secrets from the San.She turned thoughtful.Maybe SICK does not care what we know because they understand that except for our clinic and contacts in Gaborone we have little contact with the outside world.Or perhaps their people think that because we choose to live and meld ourselves this way that we are stupid throwbacks.I cant believe this.Seated before their host Ingrid reflected on all that she and her dour companion had gone through to get to this point.Now, here, in the Forbidden Zone of the Namib, they were for the first time about to meet someone who had not only worked inside Nerens but might possibly know something about the research facility itself!No, she corrected herself.This would be the second time.She had momentarily forgotten about the refugee employee Morgan Ouspel.But other than providing them with instructions on the best way to make it through the Sperrgebeit and panicking at the sight of the storage thread (a distributor he had called it), he had either been reluctant or unable to supply anything more in the way of explication save for some nonsensical babble about a big picture and its painters.Would a modern bushman who had worked at the facility know more?Or at least prove more transparent in his comments?Gwi was a surprise in more ways than one.Not only had he not undergone the extreme quadruped meld favored by his fellows, judging by his appearance he had not yet been subjected to a single manip.Short like all of his people, he was nearly as slender as Whispr despite being completely Natural.In place of the skimpy traditional attire favored by his relations he was clad in buff desert pants whose camo pattern changed according to how the sun struck the chameleon material.This was complimented by a yellow beige shirt whose pockets were stuffed with the kind of mini electronics one might expect to find on a sophisticated youth out for a skate in Cape Town or Joburg.Sand repelling sandals shod his otherwise bare feet.Among his four footed relatives he looked almost as out of place as the two Namericans.In contrast to his appearance, his first words were not encouraging.I dont know why Im talking to you two except that Auntie !Tana told me to do so.His expression as he studied them over the rim of photosensitive shades was disapproving.She said something about you trying to help mis maniped people my age.When it came to lack of tact Whispr was more than a match for the newcomer.Youve worked in the facility at Nerens?Not exactly.The young man turned his critical gaze on the much taller Meld.I work in the facility at Nerens.The correction shut Whispr up, but only for a moment.Cmonyou expect us to believe that company security lets you travel freely back and forth between the facility and the outside world?We have it on excellent authority that nobody is allowed out unless theyve first been properly debriefed.A thin smile appeared on the younger mans face.Who said anything about freely?Im San.This is my country, and in my country I come and go as I please.Ingrid wanted to believe him.Wanted to very badly, because if he was telling the truth then it presented the kind of opportunity she and Whispr could hardly hope existed.How can you get in and out of the facility without being picked up by Security?And why would you take that kind of risk?He shrugged.I take the risk because I know I can do it.I like to visit my relatives.And theres another reason.When he lowered his voice Ingrid realized it was not for their protection but for his.He didnt want any of his friends or relatives to overhear.Im a musician.As a boy I started here in the village playing modern reproductions of traditional instruments.Just like San language, San music is full of unique rhythms and sounds.Ive been to Gaborone and played in clubs there.I want to go to Harare and Mombasa, to Mauritius and Antananarivo, and expand my musical horizons.His voice filled with enthusiasm.I want to compose, and to play full bandwand!His right hand gestured.But I need a sounding meld.He indicated their surroundings; the peaceful valley, the busy village.I love my people, and my family.But a good sounding meld costs real subsist.My people have happiness, but not a lot of money.What they manage to accumulate is used for melding.There is a communal pot, but the subsist in it is not for the use of would be musicians.Thats why I took the job at Nerens.So that when I slip away from there to come here for a visit, I can take some time along the way to look for diamonds.To pay for my gear and the travels I hope to take.Find any?Whispr automatically asked.Gwis excitement faded somewhat.One or two.Poor quality.Not worthless, but far from enough to pay for the music meld I need.So I keep working, and I keep looking.All I need is one good sized gem quality stone.Thats all, just one.Get us into Nerens and Ill pay for your meld, Ingrid told him without hesitating.He frowned as he eyed her up and down.You?What are you, this mans mistress?Or a wandering hooker from the Cape Flats?Ingrid flushed so violently that Whispr worried she would faint.Iamadoctor!And this hair, this body, is just a temporary camo qwikmeld.I dont normally look like this.In my natural state I am She caught hold of herself.I really am a successful physician, Gwi.Ask !Nisa.While I see that your people have access here to many modern conveniences I suspect that a credit card processor isnt among them.But I promise you: if you help us to get inside Nerens I will pay for whatever meld you want, no matter how elaborate.I know she doesnt look like it at the moment, Whispr added tactlessly, but she really is a doctor.Good one, too.Gwi pondered their responses before replying coolly.How can you pay for my meld if you are dead?Or do you expect me to get you out of Nerens as well?Just get us in.Of course, she added with a knowing smile, if you do want me to pay for your body work then I suppose you will have to get us safely out again.The young San pursed his lips.You trouble me like lice.What proof do I have that if I help you to do this thing you will not simply shaft me once you are safely outside again?Ingrid spread her hands wide.We have no communicator and our food is running low.Without your help or that of your people theres no way we can get out of the Sperrgebeit, much less the greater Namib.She gestured beyond him.We saw that you have floaters.Get us into Nerens and out again, then take us to the nearest town that offers banking access.Ill transfer the subsist while you watch.If you want, you can bring some armed friends of yours.If we dont fulfill our side of the bargain you can take compensation on us however you wish.Whispr looked alarmed.Hey now, wait a minute, doc!Leave us maybe discuss this between us before you go promising my blood and bone on your behalf!Too late.Gwi looked satisfied.It is a bargain, Ms.?Alice, she told him.Call me Alice.Ah, he murmured, nodding.Because I am about to take you through the Looking Glass, yes?Uh, yes, surethats it.And dont mind my friend Colin here.He gets nervous whenever he thinks about actually being inside Nerens instead of just talking about it.Then he is smarter than he looks.Amusement faded from the young mans voice.There is a real possibility that once inside, you will be discovered.Then you will die.As for myself, I am prepared for such an eventuality.One who dwells in the Namib lives each day side by side with death.But I will keep you alive as long as I can.He turned to leave.I will see to it that your packs are topped up with additional food.You will need to carry your own gear.I will guide you but I will not porter for you.Thats understandable.She rose.Dont worry about me, Gwi.Im tougher than I look.Im tougher than I was.You will need to be.Just a minute.Whispr bade the other man pause.You havent told us what it is that you do at Nerens, inside the facility.Are you a scientist?Looking back at him, Gwi smiled.The only scientists among the San are in Gaborone, and a few who work in Joburg.The jobs SICK makes available to my people at Nerens are of the more mundane variety.Yet you still think youre clever enough to get us inside?Much of my work is with the facility sewerage system.So I think I am clever enough to get you inside, stick Meld, since I work with shit every day.As a suddenly grim Whispr started toward the younger man Ingrid hastened to interpose herself.I believe you, Gwi.She looked sharply at her companion.Just like I believe we wont get a kilometer from here if we start fighting before weve even started.She turned back to their new guide.The part of the facility we need to get into involves something called the Big Picture.Gwi eyed her blankly.Never heard of it.It was the response she had expected.An honest answer but a discouraging one.They were going to have to find out everything for themselves.So despite how smart you are there are areas of the facility that youre not allowed into?Whispr queried mockingly.Gwi replied as if addressing a child.Of course.I specialize in general sanitation.Why should I be allowed into the Restricted Zone?Ingrid perked up.But you know that such a place exists?The young man nodded.Security there is impossibly strict.If that is your intended destination you will never reach it.She smiled.Thats where we want to go.Thats where we have to go.Where security is tightest.Where casual visitors arent allowed.I can direct you toward it, he told her reluctantly, but I cannot take you there.It lies on the lowest level of the complex.Of course it does.Whispr was nodding knowingly.It would be closer to hell than any other part of the facility.You mean you have not already visited that famously warm place, stick Meld?I would have thought otherwise.Well, not to feel deprived.Once SICK security gets hold of you I am sure they will provide you with a ticket.One way.Before Whispr could snarl a reply, Gwi turned back to Ingrid.Let us find you some additional supplies, Doctor Alice.We can leave tonight if you like.Where company searchers may be about it is always better to move at night.Whispr nodded agreement.What kind of communicator do you use to find your way in the dark?My GPS is in my hard drive.Reaching up, Gwi touched his head.In here.Seven thousand years of accumulated intimate, traditional knowledge about this part of the world, learned at the feet of my elders.My communicator is impervious to sand, wind, and even SICK security.All the animal trails are there, all the watering places, all the holes in which to hide from the patrolling drones that will become more frequent the closer we get to Nerens.He paused, then looked again at Ingrid.You must understand that if we are stopped by Security I will have no choice but to turn you over to them.Her lips tightened.I would expect nothing less from a representative of the worlds greatest desert survivors.The Sum of Her Parts     10 Below him and to his left was the wet emptiness called the Southern Atlantic Ocean.To his right was the dry emptiness called the Namib desert.Nature in its vastness and variety was all the same to Mol, who more than ever longed for the puzzle piece packages called crowds that filled the worlds most densely populated cities.In that regard even Cape Town had its diversions.That great southern city lay far behind him now, almost as far down the barren, empty coast along which he was traveling as it was possible to go.Quiet, completely controlled anger powered him as efficiently as did the jatropha that fueled the small private VTOL aircraft on which he was the only passenger.Plenty of fury seethed within his small squat frame.He was mad at his employers for sticking him with this assignment.Mad at the foolish mismatched pair who had somehow, impossibly, succeeded in evading him on not one but several occasions.Mad at those who could have helped to bring his chase to a much earlier conclusion.Most of all he was mad at himself for allowing this project to waste, to burn up, and to occupy time that could have been better spent indulging his simple if unorthodox appetites.Well, it would be over and done with soon enough, he assured himself as the plane turned inland and began to descend.Blue green below gave way to yellow brown.Off to port, beyond the silent pilot who was the aircrafts only other occupant, a cargo vessel was unloading containers inside a single quayed harbor.In moments the sight fell behind and out of view.In the distance rose mountains of modest height and forbidding aspect.Mol knew his topography.Were the plane to travel onward in a straight line it would have to cross almost the entire continent before encountering anything resembling a center of population.The advances made by contemporary technology notwithstanding, the west and center of southern Africa was as inhospitable to man now as it had been since the breakup of Gondwanaland.There was no visible landing strip.The VTOL did not need one.Hidden electronics buried beneath the flat, dry plain guided the plane down.It was an easy site to camouflage, since the surrounding terrain looked exactly the same as the landing site.Only when the whine of the aircrafts compact jets were subsumed into the overwhelming silence and it taxied forward on battery power alone did a sizable slab of faux rock rise up like a modern drawbridge to reveal a sloping ramp that angled gently downward.Brakes squealing like a saurian hog, the plane slid into the ground like a spider entering its lair.Lights came on automatically as the hangar cover descended behind them.Figures appeared on both sides of the plane, directing it to a parking place alongside several other aircraft.All save two were the same size as the private craft that had conveyed him here from Cape Town.Wings folded up like giant white butterflies, the two larger planes were executive jets, luxuriously fitted out and capable of flying nonstop from Nerens to welcoming metropolises like Abuja, Accra, or even Casablanca.Thoughts of proper civilized cities replete with the modern amenities he loved depressed him.He forced such images from his mind.All their delights would be open and available to him as soon as he concluded this assignment.When his safety harness released him he rose and made his way to the rear of the plane, picking up his cane as he went.The pilot remained behind, ignoring his passenger as he spoke into the vorec suspended near his mouth.In the course of the flight north from Cape Town the stolid driver had exchanged perhaps two sentences with his passenger.Must remember to recommend the man for his professionalism, Mol reminded himself as he waited for the door to rise and the planes integrated steps to extend themselves.He did not wait for the pilot to follow him.The Meld could not.True and dedicated flyer that he was, his lower extremities fit tightly into the aircraft itself.He would have to wait for the landing team to disengage him.He did not fly the planehe was the plane.The burly Natural waiting for Mol near the bottom of the stairs looked as if he would rather be somewhere else doing something worthwhile.His disappointment as his attention shifted between the reader he was carrying and the old man standing at the top of the stairs was plain.Frowning, he leaned slightly to one side as he tried to see past the single figure that blocked the entrance to the planes interior.Im here to escort a Napun Mol?That would be me, Mol replied quietly.Frown morphed to scowl.Says here that Mol is a tactical operative, senior classification.You dont look like a tactical operative to meof any classification.That is the idea.When the escort looked up again from his reader there was no sign of Mol.Not until he felt the end of a cane tap him on the shoulder and, shocked, turned to see the old man standing behind him.How didhow did you ?I jumped.It is not far.The smaller mans voice tensed ever so slightly.I could have landed on you instead of behind you.But then I would have needed a new escort.While momentarily satisfying, that result would have wasted time, and I have a chronic aversion to wasting time.He smiled pleasantly.Would you be so kind as to take me to station Chief of Security Het Kruger?I have an appointment.Yes, sure, I The much bigger, much younger man swallowed hard and tucked his reader under an arm.His tone had become considerably more respectful.Its a bit of a flight up from the Cape.Wouldnt you like to see your quarters first?Maybe take a shower, unpack ?I have no luggage.Everything I need is in me.The frown returned, less put upon this time.Dont you mean on yousir?Yes, of course.On me.Mr.Kruger?The escort hesitated, but not for long.As he led the visitor from the underground hangar and into the depths of the facility he offered no more suggestions.This was wise.
