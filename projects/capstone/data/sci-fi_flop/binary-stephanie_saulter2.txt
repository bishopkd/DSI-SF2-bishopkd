Has he left you all alone?She laughed, too loudly.He went to get ready for the performance, Gwen said quietly.She would have picked up the same cues he had from Bethanys tone and body language, and Rhys could hear her being careful, modulating her voice for calm.Da is here, she nodded toward the bar, with Mikal.You know him too, dont you?What?Bethany jerked a look in the direction Gwen had indicated.Yes of course.She sounded more distracted than annoyed now.I know him very well.I should say hello.She moved as though to go to the bar, then hesitated.I, ah...Id better check on Lyriam first, though.See if he needs any help.Ill, umm, edging toward the door now, Ill catch up with all of you later, yeah?Have fun.See you after the show.See you, said Rhys as she ducked out.He turned to Gwen, and let his eyebrows rise as high as they wanted.His sister was gazing at the empty spot where Bethany had just been standing.Does she seem, said Gwen, a little stressed to you?Oh, just a bit.I wonder why.I mean she ought to be used to all this.Rhys opened his mouth to reply, then closed it again, shaking his head.Gwen had already turned away, making eye contact with the gems Bethany had abandoned and drifting over to introduce herself.He knew this sister who was not a sister better than anyone else on earth; he knew that she was quite capable of simply switching off her normally razor sharp perception when it might reveal to her things she did not particularly wish to know.It was a talent he would have liked to share.He had learned to read when best to shake her out of willful ignorance, and when to leave her alone.She would come to her own understanding of the situation soon enough.Or not.In the meantime he had plenty to worry about.Binary       5 The first of several opening acts were already halfway through their set when Eli flopped onto a curving grass bank with a good view of the stage.It formed a gentle rampart near the edge of the park, close to a hardtop path that had no doubt made it an easier destination for the less mobile gems, or those who for other reasons found the negotiation of a route through the packed crowd too great a challenge.There was a smattering of motorized scooters and walking aids below him, scattered among spectators with obvious abnormalities.Most passersby gave them a wide berth and averted their eyes.Still, it was reassuring to see how many others had congregated here, relaxed in the company of the less able.Although he had passed other gems along the wayfew of whom could have been distinguished from norms were it not for their carefully coiffed hairthe highest concentration of glowing heads surrounded him.Two of them belonged to Rhys and Gwen, and many had turned to look as they made their way across from the backstage gate.Some of the attention was no doubt due to Mikal, forging a path in front, or the curious figure of Reginald, with his fountain of white hair and shabby Remnant clothing.But much of it, Eli thought, was down to the strikingly similar beauty of the two young people who walked between them, and the unusually dark shade of their radiant hair.Reginald had emerged as the closest to an explanation of her own background that Aryel Morningstar was prepared to give, and his visits had made him familiar to both the streams and the Squats; but his other foster children had been no more than rumor, or at best stream friends with a few of the city dwellers.Now the old man folded easily down to the grass beside him, and dismissed Elis concern for his comfort with a booming laugh.Lived outdoors all my life, he said.And in the wet Welsh mountains at that.This is luxury, my friend.Eli suspected that this was true, although he knew that Remnant colonies like the one in the Beacons were no longer the isolated, frequently destitute groups of refugees many had been in the early days of the Syndrome.They might still live apart, but their ancestors had come in from the cold long enough to have the gene surgery that ensured their offspring would be Syndrome safe, and they had tablets and access to the streams.It was they, self sufficient and living close to the land, who had harbored runaways during the dark days of human gemtech, and who now mentored the new settlers of coast and countryside.It was a paradoxical relationship: Descendants of the doubters who had initially rejected modification found themselves in the end to have more in common with gems than with their homogenized, complacent norm cousins.And they were used to living on the margins.Eli wondered how much even he knew about what was really going on out there.Still havent figured it out, have they?He started out of his reverie, surprised to hear his own thoughts virtually spoken out loud.Sorry?Reginald waved an arm to take in the massed audience sprawled over every square yard of park.Them.After all that work you did, after Newhope Tower, and finding out about little Gabriel and his parents.Both sets.Youd think people would have understood the lesson.Though the memory of Newhope Tower was seared into the very fiber of his being, Eli suspected that whatever lesson Reginald was referring to might have eluded him as well.Integration is a slow process, he said carefully, against the retro wailing of a six string guitar.We always knew that some would embrace it more easily than others.Reginald turned and looked at him.The old man had a penetrating gaze that Eli already knew could be disconcerting.Now he had the uncomfortable feeling that he was missing something important.Integration isnt going to be a problem, but not for the reasons people like to think.Ill tell you something, Eli, all those norms who still worry about mixing with gems, theyve missed the point.So, he felt, had heat least whatever point it was that Reginald was trying to make.Mikal, sitting near enough to have overheard, nodded thoughtfully, and Eli felt even more lost.He was choosing his words to try again when there came a huge whoosh of displaced air at his back, a massive, unmistakable fluttering, and they looked around to see Aryel settling on top of the bank behind them.She must have circled in from the side, staying low and counting on the glare of the setting sun behind her and the crowds focus on the stage to arrive relatively unnoticed.Now she dropped down onto the turf, wings half spread both for balance and to achieve what was, for her, the complicated geometry of sitting on the ground.She flashed them a quick smile, reaching up with both hands to smooth back her chocolate dark hair and retighten the clasp that kept it firmly away from her face.Her wings shifted and rustled with the movement.The lump that was so often there rose in Elis throat, again.The pleasure he took in simply watching her seemed never to diminish.Her eyes, that astonishing midsummer blue in a delicate, pale bronze face, swept the gathering immediately around them and then further afield, checking, quartering.He could almost see her relax as she concluded that all was in order.Whatve I missed?Four songs and accompanying criticism, floated back from Rhys, propped up on his elbows just below them on the slope.They were flat, apparently.They were flat.Gwen, serene beside him, arms wrapped around her legs and chin on knees as she gazed at the stage.Not terribly flat.But a bit.And poorly arranged, you said?Nothing wrong with the arrangement as such, they just werent really up to it.Practiced chuckles from Aryel and Reginald, while Rhys arched back so they could see him roll his eyes in mock disbelief.Gwen calmly ignored them all.Rhys stopped in midmotion, his face comically upside down for a moment, as two newcomers loomed into view behind Aryel.Sharon and Callan, Eli saw, trudging up the steep side of the bank, navigating no doubt by the twin silhouettes of Aryel and Mikal.Rhys rolled over onto his knees, Gwen swiveled gracefully, and once again onstream acquaintances finally met in person.They settled down as the next act took to the stage, Sharon tucking herself into the crook of her husbands arm and Callan, after an awkward moment, allowing Aryel to pull him firmly down to sit in the little cluster over which she presided.I was worried you werent coming after all, she said softly, so that he had to lean in to hear her over the music.Im glad youre here, Callan.You need to come back into the world, love.He pursed his lips, eyes far away on the singer, or perhaps something else.A breeze ruffled his hair, and in the deepening gloom the glow from it flickered across his face like firelight, picking out the tiny lines and hollows of damage.Do I?he said finally.Im not sure.When Im out Im glad to be.Mostly.But its not always easy anymore, Aryel.Im never sure its worth the effort.It will be.Trust me.Just give it a chance.He nodded uncertainly and his gaze moved inward, grazing as hers had over the people around and below them, lingering a little on the darker glow of Rhyss head, poised in a listening stillness.There were two more performances to sit through before the main event: a spoken word troop known for their choral a cappella accompaniment to poetry both ancient and modern, and a classical quartet riding high on the current fad for instrumental music.The reason for its popularity was the young man that the thousands packed into the park, and many more watching on live streams, were waiting to see.The quartet departed and light sculptures morphed and swirled in front of the stage, camouflaging the set change and giving an impression of a deeper darkness behind.They died down slowly, like a fountain being turned gradually off, leaving the eye blinking at a pool of black in which a tight beam appeared, borne on a single sustained note.The note rippled into a phrase, then a melody, and the beam widened with it to illuminate at first only fretwork and flashing hands.Then the other instruments came in and the light broadened and strengthened, until Lyriam sat in a golden circle in the center of the stage, guitharp on his lap, head bent over the instrument as he built the song.It was the one that had made him famous, the first track on a playlist that had gone viral instantly, achieving streaming numbers not seen since the halcyon days before the Syndrome.He had written it quickly, in an outpouring of horror and fury and grief, and the world had taken it to heart in an act of collective catharsis.Even now, years later, it had lost none of its power to move; and Lyriam had built a career on it, composing complex pieces for a difficult instrument, writing music only he could play.The tale had become legend: how a gem youth picking his way through a world newly liberalized and still chaotic, lurching from one momentary, menial job to another, had been sent packing with nothing but the old wooden guitharp rescued from a crumbling warehouse, instead of the meager credits hed been promised; how he had kept hold of it through thick and thin, teaching himself to play during sleepless nights on the streets and discovering chords and tones no ten fingered musician could have managed; how a precarious life of busking had been transformed, first by the norm girl who fell in love with his music and with him, and then by the searing elegy he had played for the dead after the terror of Newhope Tower.The guitharp raged and wept through it now, and Eli could again see the blood that had washed the Squats, splashed up against the closed lids of his eyes.He blinked hard and glanced over at Aryel, and at Callan, and Sharon and Mikal with their arms twined around each other, and felt the weight of memory.And then, just as the loss and the sorrow became unbearable, the song shifted, lifting almost imperceptibly from anguish into something lighter, weary but resolute, a whisper of survival and redemption.The applause was rapturous.Eli shook himself and brushed at his eyes, saw the motion repeated all around him.Below them he could see people on their feet all over the park.Reginald, sitting bolt upright, murmured, Goodness me.Rhys muttered, Oh.Wow.Its...its different live, isnt it?He nudged his sister.Gwennie?After a moment she turned her head ever so slightly toward him, as if just waking up.Her face was still and solemn and she did not speak.The music flowed on.Lyriam, always a confident player, had become a consummate performer.He spoke to the crowd, telling of the inspiration behind tunes and sharing anecdotes from the tour.Over a tinkling prelude he said, I wrote this for a girl who bought me a cup of tea one day from a place that wouldnt serve me and then stayed to listen to me play.She liked it so much she never left.A roar of approval welled up as the song swelled into a gloriously lush, romantic piece, and he shot a quick look toward the wings.Eli glimpsed movement, saw Bethanys blond head over folded arms before she stepped back out of sight.The next tune was ancient, a melody that had made the journey from orchestral to ecclesiastic and back again.It had barely begun when Eli became aware of a murmur in the crowd off to his right, a dissonant droning accompanied by a note of rising complaint.The disturbance was close enough for him to see that a group of half a dozen or so had risen from their mats and blankets, their mouths moving not quite in unison as they appeared to sing along with the tune.As one of the press vidcams scattered throughout the park swung its light around it picked out the symbol of the United Churches, dangling from necklaces and the ropes of beads that several now carried draped over their fists.Oh, for fucks sake, Callan muttered.Rhys sat up and squinted at the only one of the group not on her feet.Her fingers were racing across what must be an input screen on the small metal box resting on the mat before her.His eyes flicked from her to the singers, many of whom had bead wrapped hands pressed to earsets.Is that an amp?he said.Theyre going to hackoh no Gwen was already on her feet and halfway down the slope.Eli swung around to look at Aryel.She had rolled forward into a crouch, one hand resting on Callans shoulder, for balance perhaps, or reassurance.His face had gone hard as marble.She looked ready to spring up into the air, although how that could do anything but add to the disruption Eli could not imagine.But she stayed still, watching Gwen.The girl pushed through the crowd, closing in on the devotees now bathed in the steady illumination of the vidcam.A gaunt man stood at their head and, perhaps realizing how few understood what was going on, waved his hands in the air and called out, This song is in praise of God!Praise God!He pumped his arms up and down, as though trying to encourage others to rise and join in.The musicians on stage seemed to be aware of something happening; they were peering over their instruments into the crowd.The sound the ragged choir was making started to leak through the speaker array, and the music began to falter.Lyriam, still playing, half rose as Gwen stepped into the midst of the UC protest.She looked up and their eyes met.Then her head jerked to the side, one hand coming smoothly up to catch her tumbling earset, the other snapping forward to pluck his from the head of the leader, her last stride taking her over the illicit amplifier as the kneeling woman reared backward in alarm.The purloined earset slid into place as the young gem came to a halt.It had been one movement, beautiful in its coordination, and blindingly fast.Another sound rose then, pouring out through the hacked speakers, drowning the shambling, off key chorus of the remaining UCs with shocking ease: the song as it was meant to be sung, clear and pure and in perfect time, a gloriously rich tone that washed over and silenced them.The extemporaneous preachers face was slack with amazement.Gwen raised her hands palm up, half placation, half shrug, as if to say, Isnt this what you wanted?and then raised them higher as she turned to the stage, a questioning What now?directed there as she kept on singing.Lyriam took one hand off the guitharp long enough to give her a thumbs up and signal to the musicians.They gathered themselves, recapturing the wavering melody, mirroring their leaders laughing face as he watched the ruby headed girl down in the crowd.She stood in the vidcams glow, facing the stunned and speechless UCs now gathered into an embarrassed little knot with the crowd pressing in behind them.Gwen sent an answering thumbs up to Lyriam, put her hands on her hips and sang it to the end.Aryel sank back onto the grass, shaking with mirth.Sharon had already patted her husbands shoulder and sauntered off down the slope, her police badge now clipped to her own shoulder and blinking blue.Gwen met her at the edge of the UC bivouac, dropped the deactivated amp and the preachers earset into her hands and strolled back up toward her family through thunderous applause and a pointing, curious crowd.Well, said Rhys, I suppose she could have just asked them to sing properly or shut the hell up.But Gwennie likes to lead by example.Zavcka Klist was not present at the concert.She would have freely confessed that there was much in Lyriams music she could appreciate, but really, there were limits.She had gone to a sponsors reception after the infotech announcement, waded into the crowd of business editors wolfing down free canaps, and skillfully turned the encounter into an impromptu press conference.When it broke up she drifted casually from one departing group to another as they all made their way to the riverwalk, finally dropping back to stroll alongside her own assistant as others began to make the turn that led toward the park.The two of them did the same, only pausing as Zavcka issued instructions for the next day.When she began to move again, this time heading for the bridge that led to the far side of the river, the assistant hesitated.You...um...youre not going to the show?he said.He was still making rapid notes on the tablet in his hand, but he threw a plaintive glance in the direction of the throngs moving up the riverwalk.Zavcka took in the look, bit back a rebuke, and instead waved a manicured hand in dismissal.No.I have other plans tonight.You go if you like, just make sure everythings taken care of.It was an unnecessary instruction, and she knew it.This one was diligent and talented enough to be worth trying to hold on to.He delivered a compact volley of reassurances, thanks, and wishes for a pleasant evening as she strode toward the bridge.She glanced back as she reached the top and saw him hurrying away upriver, already speaking into his earset, tablet still in hand.She thought he would likely try to get everything done by remote in the next half hour or so, the better to relax by the time the performances began.She sighed.These days it was the best you could hope for.Her own plans involved going home, wrapping herself in an ancient robe made from real pre Syndrome silk, and settling down to review the latest progress report from the most sensitive of her projects while the live concert streamed softly in the background.She glanced at the large screen inset in her living room wall every now and then, her gaze pausing there longest when the feed lingered over a close up of Aryel Morningstar, sitting like some sentimental vision of nirvana with the last rays of the setting sun glinting bronze and gold off her half open wings.After that the music and applause and between tune patter was a half heard backdrop to her own concerns, until the bizarre interruption by what looked to be an even more ludicrous band of zealots than usual.The shift from the stage to a crowd cam feed caught her attention, and she watched keenly and with grudging admiration as the young gem woman sang them out of countenance.The girl looked disturbingly familiar, but it was not until the song ended and the camera tracked her as she returned to her seat that Zavcka understood why.Aryel Morningstar was staring straight at her, for the second time today.At least now she was only onscreen, at the far end of a newstream feed.Zavcka frowned at the image as the girl sat down to laughter and wryly shaken heads, and what looked like a compliment from Eli Walker.As the feed cut back to the musicians onstage, she called up her messages.She had added Herran to the list of senders who would trigger an automatic alert, but now it occurred to her that this had been shortsighted.Sure enough there was her own subject line, dangling retransmission tags like accessories.As Eli had expected, her nostrils flared with irritation at Herrans curt directive, but she wasted little time on this.Leaving the message thread attached to the response was no doubt intended to have just such an effect.Of far greater interest was its result.She read the note carefully, and with a growing sense of satisfaction.It was too early to feel that anything had been accomplished yet, much less grow complacent.But at least things were, so far, going according to plan.Binary       6 Reversionists, Sharon was saying.Not the most hardline Ive ever met, but still.It was all about the importance of religious heritage, preservation of traditional values, maintenance of cultural integrity.The usual.In that case, what have they got against Lyriam playing a three hundred year old piece of music?asked Gwen indignantly.They should have been glad.They said what they objected to was it being taken out of its original context.Apparently Lyriam should have made a speech explaining its origins and giving thanks, before inviting the audience to pray while he played.Sharon greeted the howls of derision with a dont shoot the messenger shrug.She had arrived late to the after party, and walked into a storm of questions about the hymn singing hackers.A quick search onstream while they were being taken into custody had confirmed that the explanation the UC fringe group gave for their actions was backed up by a fairly comprehensive campaign, one that was already being sensationalized by the newstreams.Given that publicityplus the fact that theyd mostly used their communications privileges to post their statements to public streamsthere was little point being tight lipped about it.I wonder, said Mikal thoughtfully, if we shouldnt extend that philosophy to all aspects of life.A lecture on the cultural significance of weaving prior to buying new clothes.An acknowledgment of civilizations debt to the cultivation of wheat, to be made each time one eats bread.He eyed a tiny sample of that item, topped by an even tinier cube of meat and slice of olive, the entire confection held delicately between the double thumbs that had swooped down unnoticed to liberate it from the tray of a passing waiter.Laughter erupted around him as he popped it into his mouth, chewed, and swallowed.Imagine the level of appreciation that would generate.Careful, Mik.Eli grinned up at him.Someone might take you seriously.Youre in government now, you know.Oh, is that what happens when you get into government?Someone should have warned me.Mikal rolled his eyes, to more laughter.The little group from the grassy bank was now just a slightly denser cluster amid a busy swirl of guests in the largest of the backstage marquees.Lyriam and Bethany had joined them, separately and in both cases momentarily, before being pulled away; in Lyriams case with a backward glance and many fingered hands raised in mock despair at the collective groan as he disappeared into the crowd.Looking around, mapping the movements and mood of the party, letting multiple conversations lap against him as he often did when he wanted to gauge a general disposition rather than plumb a specific exchange, Eli could see that the young musician was, as expected, one of its focal points.Folded unselfconsciously down onto his knees, he was chatting with several chair bound gems while a standing cordon of mostly norms awkwardly waited their turn to be noticed.The other convergence centered on the twin nuclei of Mikal and Aryel; the one issuing a regular stream of witticisms from two feet above everyone elses head while the other, diminutive in height but clothed in the immense bronze and gold glory of her wings, radiated grace, charm, and blue eyed serenity.Around them the gathering coalesced, passersby lingering to overhear what others were laughing at, or angling through a sea of bodies in the unspoken hope of catching Aryel Morningstars eye.He remembered another gathering years ago, a rare case of interaction in a world where gems and norms were still separate and unequal.Even though she had been shrouded then, her wings unguessed at, he had seen how the center of gravity tipped toward her; an unexplained attraction that pulled people in, unwittingly and sometimes unwillingly.Once, there would have been snickers at the notion of gem glamour.Now Eli noted not only the attention focused on Aryel, Lyriam, and Mikal, but the knot of music insiders and press that surrounded Gwen, the easy way the gem girl talked and laughed and tossed her glowing, dark red curls away from her face.Its all about them now, he thought.There are people, norms, who would kill to be in this room.In these presences.He felt a vague disquiet at the thought, and Reginalds remark flitted through his mind once again, like the wings of a butterfly brushing against his subconscious.There was something there, he could sense the vibrations of a connection waiting to be made; but his empty glass had just been refilled, and Mikal was winding up the tale of his first day at City Hall to a delightful, devastating punch line, and Aryel had just caught his eye and smiled as she drifted close to him on the eddies and currents of the gathering.The notion, whatever it was, came and went as he let his attention be captured.They asked about you, Sharon was saying quietly to Aryel, under cover of the general hilarity.It seems their biggest worry about the operation was what your reaction would be, whether you would get involved, what impact it would have if you did.But of course what happened wasnt anything they expected, and they were desperate to know who Gwen was.Someone found an onstream reference to her as Reginalds foster daughter, which by their lights makes you sort of her older sister, or at any rate a figure of authority.So theyre reading her as some sort of proxy for you.Aryel was nodding, her smile now a little grim.Positive or negative?Theyve decided its positive, on the whole.Why?asked Eli.Their plan failed, and they were humiliated.By a gem.This lot say they dont have any problem with gems as such, and given their reaction Im inclined to believe them.What they wanted was for the song to be recognizedappreciatedas a hymn, and thats what Gwens intervention did.Far better than they could have, so theyve decided she must have been sent, or inspired, or something, by the Lord.Sharon glanced over to where the young woman stood chatting, very much the center of her own group now.Her crowd of admirers had grown, Eli noticed.Shes got a hell of a voice.She has.Aryels eyes rested on Gwen, her face pensive.And she loves to show it off.She knows all the old hymns, along with folk songs, opera, pop music.Theyll be deeply disappointed, Im afraidshe sings anything and everything, for the pure pleasure of it.And shes no ones proxy, believe me.Well, shell want to watch out that the wrong idea doesnt take root.You know what the streams are like.Ill have a word with her, but I wouldnt be surprised if shes ahead of both of us.And I dont think shell have any trouble getting the right idea out there.Not with that lot clamoring for her comcode.Rhys bit back a sigh as he watched Gwen hold court out of the corner of his eye.He felt unanchored, listening at the edges of other peoples conversations, meandering around the fringes of the various clumps that were forming as those who had gathered to listen to Sharon and laugh with Mikal now broke into smaller pockets.He covered his aimlessness by wandering over to the bar to refresh his drink, and found himself well within earshot of the cluster where Bethany held forth.They should have been arrested much more quickly.Before it became such a spectacle.Her back was to the rest of the room but she made no particular effort to keep her voice down.Her coterie of four norms and two gems, all painfully chic in razor sharp haircuts and the latest artfully tailored fashions, were hanging on her every word.Oh, I dont know.Lyriam, back on his feet now, a few paces away and surrounded by the band, turned to interject without moving across to join her.His tone was light, but Rhyss situational sense picked up the edge in it.We just heard the streamcast is getting way more hits even than the Beijing show.And Gwen sounded great.I knew she could sing, but wow.Bethany stared at him.It was your show.No one should have inserted themselves into your show.True, but since they did Im glad the story is how they got shut down by a better singer before the cops had to get involved.He ignored her outraged face, waved past her to where Sharon was slipping back to Mikals side, and raised his voice to bridge the gap.Hey, Shar?Thanks for playing it so cool out there.She sent him back a thumbs up, along with a slightly puzzled look.Rhys, who had been standing next to Mikal when she joined them in the tent, knew that Lyriam and Sharon had already spoken privately outside.This public show of appreciation could only be to make clear to the assembly of friends, fans, favored journalists and hangers on that he had no objection to how the matter had been handled, no matter what anyone else might think.Bethanys face was burning, and her group had gone quiet.Rhys winced and hastily moved away, looking for his sister.He hovered at her shoulder, knowing that her own amplified awareness would have told her he was there long before he came within touching distance.She waited until the man who was talkingone of Lyriams producers, Rhys recalledfinished a monologue about summer festivals and studio time, and then turned to pull him into the circle, slipping a hand through his arm.There you are.Come help me work out what all these people are trying to talk me into.Like you need help.I should be looking out for them.She chortled along with the rest, and introduced him to those he had not yet met.The producer said, Do you sing too, Rhys?No, Rhys replied firmly, as Gwen said, Yes.The group burst into laughter.Rhys sighed and shook his head disapprovingly at her.I can carry a tune if I have to, he told the others.But Im much happier listening.Gwens the talent.She certainly is, said a narrow woman with severely cut, dyed blue hair.An agent, this one.She frowned, pencil thin eyebrows drawn into a deep V.  Umm...it hadnt occurred to me to ask...but when you say talent.She looked at Gwen.It is a gem thing, isnt it?I mean your voice, it is enhanced?Gwens smile stayed fixed for a fraction of a heartbeat, then went back to warm and natural so quickly that Rhys knew only he could have spotted the surge of annoyance.Not that I know of, she said sweetly.My range and pitch are within norm limits.I can get quite loud without losing tone, but I dont think Id break any records.The woman seemed at a loss.The others in the circle fidgeted and glanced at each other.Rhys felt the firm pressure of Gwens hand and kept his face still.Thats fine, said the producer, slowly.Its funny, how we assumeBut it doesnt matter.It might even be a better story.So much engineering, but in the end its an old fashioned talent.A natural gift.Shining through.Hey, thats great.He grinned at them.You mind if I take a minute to post that?Streamsll love it.Go ahead, said Gwen, as the rest of the group scrambled to concur.He flicked at his earset and began muttering, eyes down and unfocused.Subvocal dictation, state of the art.The others ostentatiously did the same, or pulled out tablets.The skinny, blue haired norm was tapping away almost frantically.They are all just sheep, Rhys thought.If hed said it was a problem, theyd have gone with that too.He judged them too absorbed for the moment to notice anything in the general hubbub and slid a half step back, disengaging his arm and grunting softly at his sister.Guh.Rgu om.Gwen.Think Im going to go.She turned, holding her place in the circle, frowning as she whispered back at him.Ah?Rki.Why?I thought you were okay.Ki.Ta.Rnuloh.Im fine, just tired.Its not my thing.Rkitay.You might feel better if you stayed.Rhys shook his head.Nhh.Rnff.No, Ive had enough.The producer was finishing, eyes up now and looking at them quizzically.Gwen shot Rhys a last, fleeting scowl, eyebrow quirked in her if thats really what you want to do look, and then her brow smoothed back to perfect and the smile slid onto her face as she turned back into the conversation.Rhyss own proximity sense flared and he turned too, finding Callan behind him, paused in midstride and looking at him in surprise.Rhys opened his mouth, and found he had no idea what to say.He shut it again, and felt his cheeks go hot.Sorry, said Callan, I couldnt help overhearing.His eyes slipped over the back of Gwens head, and lingered on Rhyss face.Twin speak?I know about it, of course, but Ive never heard it used.Rhys stared.You knew what that was?Oh, of courseyour language ability.Most people just hear baby talk.Not me.Whats the matter, are you not feeling well?He nodded at the drink still clutched in Rhyss hand.That stuffs lethal.Im fine.Hang on, you understood?How?Callan shrugged.Cryptophasias almost always just mispronounced words from the mother tongue, organized via a very basic syntax.Neither of those factors is much of a challenge for me.But kids usually ditch it young, or else they never learn normal language at all.Da says it was all Gwen and I spoke when they found us.Rhys found himself rubbing his free hand self consciously over his hair, and dropped it awkwardly.We were only toddlers, so it took them a while to realize it wasnt just babbling.We picked up regular speech okay, but we never completely stopped using it with each other.Sorry, he shrugged.Bad habit.Not at all.Callan smiled at him.I havent come across a new language in seven or eight years.At least.And the UN sends me bloody everything these days.Really?They had somehow fallen into step, moving idly away from Gwen and her group.Groupies.Rhys tried to shrug off the dregs of his irritation and thought of setting the glass downhe hadnt really wanted the drink to begin withthen decided it gave him something to do with his hands.I thought you just worked with half a dozen or so main languages.There arent even that many, not anymore.The essential ones are English, Mandarin, Hindi, and Spanish, and Spanish is starting to fade.But so many of the worlds texts have never been properly translated into any of themeven the best apps dont get the nuances right.It takes a person fluent in both, and as the language pool shrinks therere going to be fewer and fewer of us who are.If it isnt done in the next couple of generations vast amounts of literature, history, journalism will just be lost.So youre translating the literary heritage of the planet?Rhys blinked, and took a sip anyway.Yes.Sounds grand, doesnt it?Sounds like something thatll take way more than one lifetime.Callan laughed.He had a rich, textured voice, just on the right side of resonant, and a warm chuckle of a laugh.I dont have it all to myself, fortunately.Theyve got a couple of others like me on the project, plus as many multilingual norms as they can scare up.But youre right, theres no way itll all get done in time.Still.Rhys was staggered by the enormity of it.That entire legacywhatever surviveswill be filtered through just a few of you.You get to put your stamp on it.It must feel amazing, to know that what you do now is going to last for the whole of human history.It does.Callans gaze slipped inward, and his expression turned thoughtful.Its good to hear you put it like that, though.When Im cooped up indoors on a sunny day, translating obscure Kurdish poetry, its easy to forget how lucky I am.He grinned at Rhys, present again and sparkling.How about you, then?I have a feeling your sister is about to conquer the world through song; what are you going to be doing?Rhys grinned back, wondering how much was safe to share.He had just decided on a compromise when he again felt the slight pressure, like a prickling in the back of his brain, that told him someone was coming up behind; and detected the vanishingly faint spiced musk scent and rustle of sound that told him who.Ill fill you in, sidestepping away from him, when were not about to be interrupted.When were what?Oh.Callan glanced around, startled, as Aryel came up between the two of them and tucked a small, strong hand inside an elbow of each.Good, you havent left yet.Rhys snorted.When did Gwen find time to tell you I was going?What with the fan club and all.For once she looked surprised.You?I didnt mean you, I thought Callan was getting ready to slip out.And dont be snarky about Gwen, she earned it.Aryels voice lowered and filled with concern.Are you all right?Fine.Oh.Okay, then.She cocked a reproving eyebrow at him.Well, its about you anyway so Im glad youre together.Callan, are you around in the morning?I was going to take Rhys down to meet Herran, but Ive just had a message.Theres somewhere else I need to be.You want me to introduce them?Sure.Nodding over her head to Rhys.Whenever you like.Thanks.He looked down at Aryel.I still dont understand why I cant just knock on his door, though.Its not like we dont know each other.Were not just stream friends, were friend friends.Dont I know it, after that stunt he pulled with the alarms.She sighed and glanced at Callan.It must seem unnecessary given how close you already are, but...Callan was nodding agreement.Youll understand when you meet him, he told Rhys.Herran interacts much more easily, more naturally, onstream than he does in person.There is a. ..pattern to communicating with him in the physical world that has to be followed.It can take him a long time to get comfortable with someone whos standing next to him, and no time at all if theyre onstream.It shouldnt be a problem for you, though, since you already have a relationship.Rhys will pick up his cues very fast, said Aryel.I think itll take five minutes.But you still need a gatekeeper to get you started.Its no problem.I was going to drop in and see him after breakfast anyway.Callan looked from Rhys to Aryel, the corner of his mouth twitching as though he might be about to break into that warm laugh again.He had been so reserved when he joined them at the concert, almost morose, and then there had been the flash of anger at the Reversionist antics.He had looked too stern to be handsome.But after the music and merriment and a couple of drinks his face had relaxed, was amused and open and very, very beautiful.He smiled down at Aryel.And youre right, as usual.I was about to head home, but then I ran into Rhys instead.So if you want to go soon, glancing back to Rhys, green eyes catching the light like emeralds, Im ready any time.Aryel watched them leave, keeping her own smile sedate, aware that too many onlookers might read too much into it.If his name cropped up in the river of gossip no doubt already flooding out of the evening and onto the streams, Rhys would be mortified.She turned briskly away from the entrance to find that Reginald stood next to her.His own grin was unabashed.Well, that was quick.Stop it.Oh, please.They were checking each other out before we even got in here.They didnt know they were.At least, Im pretty sure Rhys didnt.Maybe not Callan either.Hes been out of circulation for a long time.So?Stuff happens, whether youre aware of it at the time or not.Ill place a wager on them getting the circulation goinghe theatrically waggled his eyebrows at herbefore the week is out.Maybe before the evenings out.What odds are you offering?Theyre just two young men, walking home on a balmy, moonlit night.She could not help grinning back at him.What could happen?With any luck, a great deal.He needs it.He appraised her, squinting down his nose.I should see if I cant find someone to see you home.Whatll you do, strap them to a kite?Thats a piss poor excuse to spend your life alone, Aryel.Reginald.My dear Da.Can you imagine the uproar?What this...circus...would turn into?She refrained from waving at the room, instead letting her gaze slide absently around it, and back to him.My life is complicated enough.He could deal with the complications.More importantly, he would.Who would?Dont be coy, girl.You know who.The bushy eyebrows now arched in the direction of Eli Walker, on the far side of the marquee and listening with every appearance of interest to a commentator from one of the more breathless socialstreams.Do you a world of good.It wouldnt do him any.There was steel in her voice, and Reginald knew he had finally gone right up to the edge, and possibly slightly over it.Ive already asked a great deal of him, and I may have to ask more, but Ill neither lie to him nor tell him the truth he wants to know.Not if I can possibly help it.I wont risk the damage to us both.Binary        Divergence There is a moment when she understands that she is different.She is still very, very small when she knows this, but she is already aware of disparity.She knows that the men and women who care for her, who feed her and bathe her and dress her in clothes poorly adapted for her awkward anatomy, who have gentle voices and kind eyes under brightly glowing hair, are not the same as the ones who instruct them, with their crisp tones and sharp glances.Those ones wear shiny white coats, and their hair does not glow.Under the coats their clothing varies, and she glimpses different iterations of skirt and suit and boot.Her carers all wear the same shapeless, gray drab pants and loose tops, much like her own.But the gap between the carers and the others is not a matter just of clothing or hair color or even their roles as servants and served.There is something missing from the warmth of those gentle men and women, from the affection she longs for and looks forward to.There is a dullness about the eyes below that brilliant hair.The kindness is real but somehow empty, shallow.Their awareness seems far less acute than hers.They teach her to speak, simple words repeated over and over, and she knows, with a frustration that causes her sometimes to ball her little hands into fists and scream at them in her fury, that she could learn so much more, so much faster, than they are capable of teaching.The others watch.They have more words, those others, and she would like to learn them.Their gaze is as quick and inquisitive as her own, and there is a certainty about them, a confidence in the way they come and go and move and speak, that she is drawn to.But they are testers, not teachers, and they rarely smile or speak to her directly.Mostly they take her to the cold place, where everything is as shiny and flat as their coats, and she is undressed and measured and probed and scanned and twisted and spread and stretched.Some days it hurts, and when she cannot help but cry they call in one of the attendants, a large woman with hair called orange or a thin man topped by purple to comfort her.So she understands difference, but it takes a particular day for her to understand it in relation to herself.It is a day when they have detoured through the room where they keep the other children.There are four.(She knows this because the orange woman has recently taught her her numbers, first to five, then when she insisted on more, to ten.She could see them stretching on and on in her mind and she wanted to be given the names of all of them, but the orange woman seemed to know no more, and she grew angry and cried, and the orange woman cried, and there were no more numbers. )Two of the children seem to be asleep, eyes closed beneath the clear plastic hoods of their cots.One twitches and makes muffled mewling noises, through a mouth pinched into a strangely sharp projection.The skin of her back is distended, and beneath it things like cables seem to curl around and about each other in a tangled, terrifying mass.Some days her eyes are open, and then she is propped into a sitting position in her cot; but they are never aware.She has no arms.The other is still and silent, save for the muffled hiss from the tubes that go into his nose and mouth.His arms and legs are shrunken and twisted, curled into his chest; but his shoulder blades are massive, sharp edges pressing triangles through the skin.More tubes emerge from beneath the blanket that covers him to the waist.She has never seen him otherwise, and his eyes never open.The other children are awake and out of their cots.One has a sweet, vacant face.There are little flaps for arms this time, and a body that ends abruptly at the hips.She smiles without comprehension when she sees them.The fourth child does seem to understand something, though it is hard to be sure since the face is almost nonexistent.Round blue eyes stare at them over gaps that might be a nose and mouth.That one is able to walk, though his spine is painfully twisted, but they are both strapped into strollers for the short trip to the testing room, and the purple man and a white coat woman are waiting to do the pushing.The senior white coat who is taking her today stops and looks them over.His gaze travels across the hissing cots, and then he looks down at her and shakes his head.What makes you so damn special?he says, in that tone they sometimes use where they dont really expect an answer.He squats down in front of her suddenly, eye to eye, frowning.She frowns back.If it werent for you we could have shut the whole batch down by now.He sounds angry.But no, we have to keep at it until we work out how the hell we came up with you.You are the fucking anomaly.We cant even manage to fucking replicate you, so I dont see the point.Ano ma lee, she says carefully, hoping he will explain.He blinks at her, a jolt of surprise crossing his face, and then he stands abruptly and they proceed along bright white corridors where sounds fall dull, and into the testing room.She turns what he said around and around, trying to grasp the meaning, trying to fill in the words she doesnt understand with tone and gesture, trying to connect them to something she does understand.Things are beginning to shift.She can feel it, and it scares her.It scares her so much she wants nothing more than to give up and cry, but she knows that will not help.It will only confuse and exhaust her, and she senses a potential in the moment that should not be wasted.So she swallows it down and waits until they have put the sensor pads in place all over her head and shoulders and back, and the white coat is standing beside her starting to press buttons on the machine, and then she grabs his sleeve and tugs hard.Dok tor Ow wen.He turns and stares down at her, his face blank with astonishment.She hears the gasps and murmurs from the other white coats, but she keeps her eyes fixed on him.You.His face is still slack.You know my name?She lets go of his sleeve and points to the other children, hooked up as she is, waiting.She feels urgent, as though understanding is both close and crucial.As though everything depends on it.She asks a question to which she already, in that moment, knows the answer.Wike dem?she says.Awwel wike dem?He squats down in front of her again then, and the customary distaste in his face and voice have been replaced by something else.No, Aryel, you are not like them.You are not like anything.Binary       PROPOSITION       Binary       7 The city wheeled below her.She could see pigeons flee for the safety of ledges as they sensed her shadow.Crows peeled up for a closer look, then decided that whatever she was, she posed no threat.This high up the cars and people on the teeming summer streets were no more than specks, and she could take in the tapestry of the city: a chaotic matrix of pale roads dividing the uneven gray of roofscapes from green strips of parkland, punctuated by glistening towers that thrust up into her domain.She glided lazily between them, riding a warm current of air, enjoying the heat that beat down on her barely moving wings.She held the glide for as long as she could before shifting regretfully into a slow, graceful bank that took her left toward an elegant spear of black glass.To her right the brooding steel spike of Newhope slipped behind and out of view.The bullet shaped apex of the BelNatur building was blunted at the tip, a landing pad intended for the more brutal aerodynamic power of an executive helicopter.She beat hard for a moment to clear the currents that swirled around the tapering tower, then swept her wings back and dropped in from the top.There were only two in the greeting party, and she silently acknowledged the contradiction of being both pleased to be able to touch down without the usual gawking audience, and knowing it was more likely that the staff had not been told of her visitor were forbidden to witness itthan native uninterest.One of the people waiting for her was a blocky, middle aged man with lines deeply etched into his face, dressed in a discreet black uniform.His impassive expression slipped for just a moment as he watched her land, and then he flicked a sideways glance at his companion and pulled the mask of professional indifference back into place.The other was Zavcka Klist.She watched until Aryel had folded her wings and brushed back a stray strand of hair, as if waiting for confirmation that her visitor had given up the air and become earthbound once again.Then she stepped forward, hand out, crisp and formal.Ms.Morningstar.Thank you for coming.Aryel met her eyes, a gray as dark as smoke.As she took the proffered hand she wondered fleetingly if Zavcka would indulge in the childish spite of squeezing too hard.Instead the handshake was as firm, brisk, and brief as her own.Ms.Klist.She let the corner of her mouth kink up in time with an ironically raised eyebrow.Thank you for inviting me.Zavckas face twitched in response, but she accepted the polite fiction gracefully.Shall we go inside to talk?Its a bit windy up here.She glanced at the silent man, standing a couple of paces back with hands clasped loosely behind him, and added, For some of us.If youd prefer to stay outside thats fine.Its windy for all of us.By all means lets go in.She thought she caught a flicker of surprise, heard it confirmed in the guards grunt of approval.Perhaps they had expected her to insist on remaining in the open; if so he would have been unhappy at the thought of leaving his employer unprotected up here.So Zavcka had probably already made it clear that she would be speaking with Aryel Morningstar alone.As it was the man busied himself with a state of the art identipad that combined finger and retinal scans, and a heavy steel door slid noiselessly back.It looked new, and she thought with amusement as Zavcka ushered her through that they might well have installed it specifically to keep her out.A short, plushly carpeted corridor led directly to the elevator shaft that formed the spine of the building.The man, still unintroduced, stood back to let them enter and looked questioningly at his boss.Thank you, Dunmore.Thatll be all for now, she said, and he stepped back to let the door slide shut on the two women.Alone together for the first time, they regarded each other over folded arms.It took Zavcka a moment to register the shared pose, and she dropped hers to her side.Aryel rewarded her with a faint smile, and stayed as she was.Zavcka cleared her throat.Dunmore is our head of security.He was doubtful about asking you to meet here.Did he imagine I would be a threat?More that you might imagine yourself to be threatened.He tells me there are still gems who fear being disappeared, were they to venture within the walls of a gemtech.An outdated worry if ever there was one.I see I was right to think you wouldnt ascribe to it.Indeed.Aryel nodded seriously.There is also the fact that half of London just watched me land on your rooftop.So no, Im not worried at all.Zavckas nostrils flared.Aryel smiled at her sweetly.There was a soft chime and the doors swept open.Zavcka said, Here we are, in a tone that, while still impeccably polite, had turned terse.They stepped into a luxurious lobby, only a couple of floors below the roof level.It swept out on either side of them to the curving glass walls of the building, which let in panoramic views of the city below.Aryel could see that the expansiveness of the room extended into perimeter walkways that appeared to run around the entire circumference of the tower.Zavcka walked straight ahead, however, toward another corridor that cut through the heart of the building, and was lined with more of the beautifully biocrafted wood paneling that formed the back wall of the lobby.A reception desk guarded it, manned by a fashionable young woman whose poise appeared ready to dissipate when she saw Aryel.She half stood, then sat back down again, and belatedly shut her gaping mouth with a snap as she looked from Aryel to Zavcka.An equally fashionable young man turned with exaggerated casualness from, Aryel was quite certain, only pretending to speak to the girl as he leaned against the desk.He seemed better prepared, smiling and inclining his head graciously to them both.Just then two more people strolled into the lobby, feigning startled looks that, as always, became genuine wonder within a microsecond.They seemed not to have planned what to do once theyd gotten their eyeful, and Zavcka glared at them balefully as they paused in confusion and then proceeded hastily across the lobby to disappear into one of the walkways.A high pitched, slightly hysterical giggle sounded from that direction, swiftly muffled.The fashionable man shot a disapproving look after them, as Zavcka snapped at the girl.Ms.Morningstar and I will be in my office.Please see to it were not disturbed.She nodded, speechless and scared.There was a spark of something defiant in the mans eyes, but his tone was pure deference as he said, Can I get you anything, maam?Zavcka managed to suppress an irritated sigh.She had not, Aryel thought, intended to be quite so hospitable.Coffee for me, Khan.Ms.Morningstar?Tea, please.She flashed a smile at the two employees as she followed Zavcka into the corridor, partly for the effect she knew it would have, partly in real sympathy.Without turning around the BelNatur head said, I do apologize.I cant imagine what my staff is thinking.I can.Shall I tell you?Zavcka glanced back at her, frowning.Please.Theyre thinking that while youll be displeased, youre unlikely to dismiss or even really discipline them merely for happening to be in the lobby when I happen to walk through it.And that getting that close a look at me is worth the risk.They had reached the end of the corridor.Zavcka looked narrowly at Aryel as she raised her fingers to an identipad.You seem quite certain of your effect on them.Sadly, Im used to it.The door slid open as smoothly as had the one on the roof, and Aryel stepped into an office almost as big as the lobby they had left behind.The skywalk did not run all the way around the building after all; the rear wall was a sweeping curve of glass barred sky.Zavcka glanced at the huge biocrafted wood desk and the straight backed chairs before it, then appeared to make a decision.She led the way instead to a scattering of soft leather furniture and sank onto a sofa.Aryel selected a low armchair that her wings could rest over the back of.Thus raised and arched they were potent, almost a presence of their own as they shifted with her movement.Zavcka watched her settle, elbow propped on the arm of the sofa, chin on fist.She looked deeply reflective suddenly, as though considering the import of Aryels words, but there was still something avid in her gaze.Yes, I expect you are.But do you really regret your celebrity?Given the circumstances that led to it, Aryel said evenly, its a small price to pay.But would I have preferred other circumstances, ones that would have allowed me to remain fairly anonymous?Yes, and for far greater reasons than my own privacy.That was cutting very close to the bone.Aryel watched her reaction keenly.Zavcka could hardly have expected less, not on this subject, but she still looked away.It was almost a flinch of embarrassment.I. ..of course.The circumstances were shocking.A horrendous loss of life.Aryel wondered for an astounded moment if it was an oblique apology; if Zavcka Klist really intended, really had the nerve, to sit here and offer condolences for those bloodstained days.She thought of Callan and all he had lost; of the damage to Bal and Gaela and Gabriel, and the friends they had had to bury.Her mind finally fixed on Donal, another battle scarred survivor, and imagined the abuse he would be screaming if only he could hear this conversation.She held on to the picture, channeling her own anger into her mental image of his, and felt it leave her calm, cool, clear headed.It was a trick Reginald had taught her, long ago.Zavcka was back to her own cool stare, as though awaiting a response.Aryel sat and stared back, letting the tension build, until there was a soft tap at the door.Khan came in, busied himself pouring and serving, and departed with evident regret.Zavcka regarded Aryel over the rim of her cup, and began without further preamble.You must have inferred that my offer to Herran has to do with our infotech program.Aryel sipped before answering.The tea was good; hot and strong.We did.Although neither Herran nor I could infer quite what you had in mind.Or why you would imagine he would consent to helping you.Lets deal with the what first.I believe the why will become evident.A touch there of the old arrogance.She was onto more comfortable ground now.Never look back, eh, Zavcka?The past is another country, a big one, full of peril.If you keep moving forward fast enough maybe it wont catch up with you.Virtually all of our current infotech applications require a manual interface, said Zavcka.The most common technogiestablets, security systems, aircraft and ground vehiclesall of them rely on us to transmit our instructions via some intermediate mechanism like touchscreen or audio input or motion capture.That requirement is a fundamental limitation.She looked at Aryel as if anticipating disagreement.Aryel sipped her tea and said nothing.We think we should be able to do away with most of the intermediate hardware, if we can work out how to set up a direct neural link.She paused again, expectantly, and Aryel shrugged.I assumed as much from your announcement.But youd still need an interface.Weve made great progress there alreadywere working on a cranial band thats as light and unobtrusive as an earset.Youd simply think it on, do what you want to do, and think it off again.You could work on the fly, as it were.Aryel managed to smile at the pun.I rather like not working while flying.As it were.What does this have to do with Herran?Ah.Zavcka nodded.Well.Herran is, as we both know, very special.The core challenge of the work Ive just described is the accurate translation of detailed information between binary code and synaptic signaling.And were pretty sure that Herran is as close to a walking digital neural dictionary as has ever been.And you think that because?Zavckas lips compressed.Aryel sensed that another flash of temper, like the one shed seen out in the lobby, was being firmly suppressed.Lets be candid with each other, shall we?I think we both know that Herran can access and alter data in ways that no humangem or normshould be capable of.In retrospect I suppose its not all that surprising.He was designed to test the thesis that the human brain could be rewired to mimic an artificial processor.Why you would want to change the most subtle and powerful computing device known to humanity into something fundamentally inferior is another question entirely, and part of the reason the program was canceled.But we know that Herran had by far the most promising test profile.What he didnt appear to havethenwas anything remotely like normal human cognition, although it now seems his handlers simply didnt recognize his full range of competence.I suppose you know that his...departure...coincided with a mysterious failure at every level of a complex security protocol, from the sequential disabling of locks and alarms to unauthorized changes in the guard rotation.She paused for breath and to glare at Aryel, who was smiling gently.There was no trace of how that was accomplished.Nothing in the edit logs, no sign of a hack.The forensics team had never seen anything like it.Until three years ago, when they reported to me on how you had apparently hacked a datastream within this company that was so secret and so encrypted only a handful of people even knew of its existence.She held up a hand, though Aryel had made no move to speak.Ive no quarrel with you over the information you accessed, but I wanted to know how youd done it.And they couldnt tell me.Once again there was no trace.But at least this time theyd seen something like it before.So we looked for what the two events had in common, and the most probable answer was Herran.Aryel regarded her for a moment, then put her empty cup down on the low table with a clink.That is all very interesting.It doesnt explain precisely what you want Herran to do for you, or why you expect him to agree.We want him to help us.Hes got a brain that speaks binary as well as human.We want to work out how he does it, so we can create a translation matrix to replicate it.We wont harm him in any way, or make the process at all unpleasant for him.I said it would be rewarding, and I meant it.Well pay extremely well for his services.Herran doesnt care about money.He has what he needs.He particularly wont care about helping you make more of it.Zavcka nodded briskly to show she had expected this answer.At the moment, what weve deduced about his abilities is known only to me and a few of my most senior staff members.At the moment, we have no intention of revealing that information to anyone else.Which is fortunate, dont you think?The consternation there would be at the thought of a gem who can infiltrate any data, news, or socialstream undetected, find out anything, alter anything, create anything, and leave no trail whatsoever would bewell, it doesnt bear thinking about.The gemtech argument for registration and control of potentially dangerous gems would be back from the dead.That, said Aryel softly, was your argument.It was.It isnt any longer, but there are plenty of others still carrying the flag.And while some people might be comforted by the notion that his expeditions within the streams are likely directed by you, many, I suggest to you, will not be.Theyll finally have a credible reason to be suspicious of you.Theyll wonder who else youve had him spy on.Theyll wonder whether Herran, who BelNatur records suggest is severely autistic and probably incapable of moral judgment, goes off exploring without your guidance.Theyll want him controlled and cut off.Aryel leaned back in the chair and resisted the urge to flex her wings in irritation.Instead she looked thoughtfully around the room.Was this Felix Carringtons office?Zavcka blinked in surprise at the non sequitur.It was, yes.It suits you very well.She caught Zavckas eyes.Her own had gone hard as an August sky.That secret datastream you referred to earlier.Surprising how few other people did know about it.The only subscribers besides Carrington had already disappeared or been incarcerated.Of course thats not what he said at the trial.He mentioned your name quite a lot.The other woman was watching her with a sort of intense calm.There was a note of practiced boredom in her tone.By then he was trying to implicate anyone he could.Personally, I think hed become delusional.You know very well there was no evidence in the files you accessed, nor in what the prosecution forensics uncovered later, to suggest I knew anything about it.Thats not quite right.Aryel shook her head gravely.The forensics report represents the best efforts of the investigating officers.The files I released represent my best judgment.Which is open to revision.She paused just long enough to let the meaning become clear, and watched Zavckas eyes widen and her relaxed posture become rigid.Then she went on, quiet and relentless, What you have to consider, Ms.Klist, is that if Herran is capable of everything you claim, one must assumeas indeed youve suggested the public would assumethat there are other things he will have discovered as well.And if he is indeed my datastream spy and fixer, it would stand to reason that anything he knows, I know.Your own skills are remarkable; Im not surprised the authorities failed to pick up your trail.Herran is, as you say, in a different league.Zavcka fought for composure, staring back at her like a cornered cat.I dont believe you.No?No.If you had found anything to implicate me in the Gabriel affair youd have included it.Id be in prison too.You have no reason to protect me.True.You are merely a beneficiary of the situation you outlined a moment ago.If I exposed something the authorities couldnt corroborate independently Id have to prove that I hadnt simply invented it.And how could I have done that?By...oh.You couldnt have explained without bringing Herran into it.Of course.Zavcka sat back and drew a deep breath, calming herself, although her nails clicked unconsciously against the arm of the sofa and a tic appeared to ghost across her pale face.The dark eyes were bitter, and Aryel could see the fear flickering behind them.But her voice was steady as she finally said, Well.We appear to have achieved a stalemate.She looked around the office, as though a way out might appear.Aryel looked past her, at the wide sky beyond the glass, and longed to be gone.She sighed.Yes, but all that means is neither of us can threaten the other into anything.Which is as it should be.I have plenty of reasons to doubt your integrity, but you now have a reason to exercise some.Ill talk to Herran about the project and your offer, and see what he says.Its not for me to decide whether he takes you up on it.Isnt it?No it isnt.I dont have servants or staff, Ms.Klist.I have friends.That did produce a flinch.It was, Aryel thought, the very least she deserved.But we had better be clear right now that, in the unlikely event he agrees to work with you, there are going to be conditions.Binary       8 Sharon Varsi pressed three fingers to an identipad and announced herself, once again running the mornings briefing on the first full day of the Festival over in her head.Everything had run fairly smoothly so far, and if the ragtag troop from the night before was the worst theyd have to deal with the police could count themselves fortunate.She could not think what else this summons might be about.The door slid back, and she stepped inside.The man who had asked to see her was rising from his chair, swinging the tablet on its angled stand to the side, although his eyes still lingered for a moment on whatever he had been reading there.Commander Masoud of the Metropolitan Police shook her hand.DI Varsi.All right?Very good, thank you, sir.He waved her to a seat.Hows it going?The Festival?Its early days of course, sir, but thereve been no real problems yet.A few hackbot swipes at the infostream, a couple of noise complaints.The usual.There was a disturbance at the concert last night thats gotten some attention.Might as well be the one to bring it up.The speakers were hacked for a couple of minutes.It was sorted out fairly quickly.He looked amused.Ive seen that onstream, along with your report of the incident.Very well handled, I have to say.I wish I could take the credit, sir.By the time I got to them it was pretty much over and done with.The young woman who faced them down.Friend of the family?In a manner of speaking, though wed only just met.Shes Reginald Morgans foster daughter.Sharon wondered if, despite his overall tone of approval, Masoud had called her in to have a word about allowing Gwen to confront the Reversionists.By rights it should have been left to the professionalsI told her so, afterbut she reacted very quickly.By the time I realized what she was going to do, shed already done it.I thought it best to let her finish the song, rather than disrupt the event further.Mmm.Well.Masoud gestured vaguely, dismissing her concern.Youre right of course, though I got the feeling, watching, that she could probably handle herself.And she made them look ridiculous, which is more than we could have managed without blowback from the public.Any worry about repercussions?You mean to her?No, I dont think so.Not from them anyway.
