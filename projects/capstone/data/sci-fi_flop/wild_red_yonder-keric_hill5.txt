""I am willing to make a deal to get home," Mabok said, "Only you must know how to fly the Pinak better than the last time."Mabok laughed, but Gavin replied assuredly, "We can learn if you teach us.""There is a planet far from here where other Purple Men live," Mabok told Gavin."There are no Jaka military there.You must take me there in the Pinak and leave me with them.Then you can have the Pinak.My family can travel there and meet me.Are you interested?""We're interested," Gavin said, "We're definitely interested.Mabok shook Gavins hand and Gavin could see a little bit of a smile.***Gavin approached the Colonel, who was talking loudly on his cell phone."Who assigned the personnel on this project?"the Colonel growled on the phone, "Theyre just a bunch of college boys without any kind of discipline whatsoever!All they care about is tinkering with the alien equipment.We are not here to play with toys!This is a military operation.We have security to worry about here.Get me some real soldiers here by next week!"After the Colonel finished he angrily punched a button on his phone to turn it off.We swung around to face Gavin."Colonel," Gavin said, "The Purple Man has agreed to teach us about his ship.Can we get him out of his cell for a couple of hours a day so we can""I dont care if you get him out of his cell all day long," The Colonel yelled, "Just get out of my face!"***Cliff exited the Pinak through the now open equipment bay door.He found Gavin and Jeff with Mabok and his guard, Wes.A bunch of alien equipment was laid out on the ground."Whats going on, Gavin?"Cliff asked."Mabok is showing us how to manufacture fuel," Gavin answered."Hes been cooperating very well," Jeff said, "except he keeps saying that we need to hurry.He doesnt realize that all of this is new to us.Gavin, have you talked to the Colonel about all of this?""He hasn't given me the time of day," Gavin said."So I haven't told him about Mabok's plan yet.""So how does this thing make fuel?"Jeff asked."Here is a fuel processor," Gavin said as he pointed to a large piece of machinery."Water is pumped in and converted to fuel, and the fuel is then pumped into the ships tanks in there," Gavin said, pointing to some hoses that led into the engine room.Several men were using wrenches to fasten an irrigation pipe to the equipment.Calvin Schmitt stood nearby with an extra section of pipe."Calvin here has been a great help," Gavin said, "He helped us connect up this water line to the fuel processor.""Thanks for your help," Cliff said to Calvin."Anytime.""Well, Gavin," Jeff cut in, "Weve had a long day, so well head to the trailers.""Ill meet you there shortly," Gavin replied.***"Whats the problem, Gavin?"Jeff asked as Gavin dressed quickly in their trailer."Come on, let's go to the ship," Gavin said."They just told me that a message is coming in on the Pinak radio. "Jeff followed Gavin to the Pinak and into the radio room."I think Im picking up something," Gavin said, holding out his hand for quiet."Plistark, junto Jaka shordin Cartoh.Jiklew baront ferten.Kurtoona feh lenn acunta norheg lenn, nor... "From Gavin's expression, Jeff knew that something was interesting.After the message was over, Gavin turned to Jeff."How many days since we captured the Pinak?"Gavin asked."Twenty one," Jeff said, "Why?""Mabok said his home world would try to communicate with the Purple Men here on day twenty one," Gavin said."He was right about that.If he was right about the rest, we only have ten days to destroy the way station.I think it's time we got this show on the road."***Gavin went to wake the Colonel as soon as he had climbed out of the Pinak.The commander rubbed his eyes and looked at Gavin, "Now what were you saying?""We would like to launch the Pinak as soon as possible," Gavin said again, "Mabok is willing to help us stop the fleet in exchange for his freedom.""And he claims we can use this ship to stop a fleet of Purple Men?"the Colonel asked doubtfully."By sabotaging part of their transportation network," Gavin explained."Transportation network?""Yes, sir.""How do you know that this isnt hogwash?""Sir," Gavin explained, "I don't know that this isn't hogwash. ""Were not going to launch the ship," the Colonel said."I think that even if this isnt a hoax, we wont be able to do anything about it, seeing as we dont have any experience with combat in space.Thank you for bringing this to my attention, and Ill contact the Pentagon in the morning.This ship is too valuable a possession to risk on this Purple Mans word.Now don't wake me up this early again for your dumb ideas," the Colonel concluded roughly.***Cliff and Jeff knocked on the door of the detention trailer where Mabok was held prisoner.Wes, the guard, opened it up."Yeah," he said gruffly."There is a leak on the ship," Cliff said, "and we need the Purple Man to help us patch it up. "Wes eyed them carefully.Cliff shifted his weight around and looked at Jeff nervously.Cliff began to get scared that Wes knew he was lying."Ha!"Wes laughed, "You expect me to believe that story?"Wes saw them exchange a worried look."You know, Id say that you two are going to do it!"Wes exclaimed."What?""Youre going to launch the thing into space, arent you?""No, theres a leak and we  " Cliff tried to explain.Wes lowered his voice, "Hey, I heard the rumors.Im with you on this one.Ill go get the Purple Man."Cliff and Jeff just stood there, astonished.Wes let Mabok out, and unlocked his handcuffs."If you have any room on board," Wes asked, "I would give an arm and a leg to...Well, is there any room?""Yeah," Cliff answered, almost laughing, "Get your stuff and lets get moving!"***Cliff stopped in his tracks and motioned for the others to hide behind a fence.Jeff looked around and saw the sentry, too.The man was pacing around the ship under the bright lights.There was no way past him.The sentry turned and saw them standing just outside the perimeter fence.Cliff turned to go away."Hey, you!"the sentry called out.He walked over to them with a flashlight."Hold it right there!"Then he recognized Jeff and Cliff."Oh, excuse me," the sentry apologized, "I thought you were someone else.Some UFO snoop has been hanging around the area causing trouble and  " the sentry stopped mid sentence when he noticed Mabok."Wait a minute!Shouldnt he be in his trailer?""Joe," Wes whispered to the sentry from behind Cliff, "Will you be quiet!Were trying to sneak on board here!""Listen," the sentry said, "You cant mess around on the ship at night, the Colonel said it was off limits and he was as grumpy as ever.""Joe," Wes said again, "Were going to take off, so will you be quiet before one of the other sentries sees us!""No," Joe said slowly, "the Colonel said no.But are you really going to launch?""Yeah, so will you shut your trap and get on board?"Wes growled.***Jeff shook Gavin until he woke up."Gavin, lets go!"he whispered as loud as he dared."Wha  what?""Were going, come on!"The curtain on the bunk above Gavins bunk slid aside and a head popped out."Youre gonna launch?"A couple of lights turned on behind the curtains of the two other bunks and other faces appeared.Gavin and Jeff made their way to the Pinak with five other men silently following behind with their bags.Gavin climbed down the ladder into the cockpit and turned around to see half a dozen men already inside.Cliff came through the hatch on the back wall."Cliff," Gavin called, waving a hand towards the others, "Who are all these people?""Well... "Cliff tried to think of an explanation."Permission to come aboard?"one of the men asked."Okay," Gavin replied, "We might as well.Well probably need all the help we can get.But, Cliff, is there anyone on the base that doesnt know were leaving?""The Colonel, I hope," Cliff replied.***The horizon was beginning to brighten a bit as Calvin Schmitt trudged toward his barn.He glanced at the Purple Man ship several hundred yards away with its cluster of trailers around it.He started to cut across a section of his field and looked down to notice a few inches of water in the furrows.The federal guys must have disconnected his irrigation piping without turning off the water.He stabbed his shovel in the ground and started towards the trailers.***"Mabok," Gavin called from his seat in the cockpit, "How much fuel do we have?""The tanks were almost full when we disconnected the pipes," Mabok replied as he rushed back and forth from control panels in the cockpit.Cliff climbed up through the floor hatch."Gavin," Cliff called, "Theres another group of men that just came aboard in the equipment bay."Gavin grumbled and followed Cliff to the back of the ship.Inside the equipment bay there were eight more men, standing with some of their belongings."Listen guys," Gavin said as soon as he had stepped through the airlock, "I dont want you to get the impression that were taking this ship up just to check it out.Theres a chance we might not come back.So, anyone can get off now.Just tell me if you want to."A man in the back raised his hand."I understand, Frank," Gavin said sympathetically, "I dont have a problem with anyone dropping out.""No," Frank replied, "I just wanted to know if I have time to get my camera."***Calvin Schmitt walked with his dog, Baker, up to the barbed wire fence and looked inside.No one was guarding the fence like they usually were.The floodlights were off, and the gate was open.He walked in and followed his water pipe to the side of the alien ship.A big door on the side was open and the lights were on inside.Calvin saw a man moving some duffles around."Excuse me," Calvin called out."Yeah," the man answered.Calvin recognized him as the man who usually guarded the Purple Man.It was Wes."Are you done with the water?"Calvin asked, pointing to his irrigation pipe that was lying on the ground gushing water."Are we ever!"Wes exclaimed."Were taking this baby into space, buddy!""Really?Is it alright if I watch the blast off?""Alright?Hey, pull up a chair!"***"Gavin," Mabok said as Gavin came back in the cockpit, "Were ready to button it up and lift off.""Good, start closing the hatches," Gavin said.Cliff climbed up the ladder to the top hatch and peeked out before he closed it.The sun was almost up.He glanced at the Colonels trailer and noticed that the lights just flickered on inside.Cliff slammed the hatch down."Gavin," he gasped, "The Colonel is awake!"Gavin could see in his mind what the Colonel would do if he caught them.He turned to Mabok."Lets get out of here.Ill go shut the bay doors, and you start up the engines.""Right."Wes was stowing the baggage when the engines started.The ship shuddered a little and then a high pitched whine built up in the engine room, followed by a roar.Calvin's dog jumped through the bay door into the Pinak while he wasnt looking.The dog was sniffing around someones bag of food.The ship started to lurch and shudder as it built up power and then slowly lifted a few feet off of the ground.The dog began running back and forth excitedly along the edge of the open bay door, crouching and barking as if he wanted to jump out.Calvin turned around and gasped when he saw Baker inside."Come on Baker!"Calvin shouted, holding out his hands."Come on!"Baker pranced back and forth, looking at the ground below, which was bathed in a flickering orange glow.He didnt come.Gavin scrambled through the airlock into the equipment bay."We gotta get the door closed!"he shouted, cupping his hands around his mouth.Wes sprinted over to the controls.He jammed the lever down and the door started creaking closed.After that, Gavin quickly left the area.Neither Wes nor Gavin had noticed that Calvin had jumped onto the ship and was lunging after his skittish dog.Up in the cockpit, Mabok started easing the Pinak forward along the ground.It shuddered and wobbled.It was a lot easier for him to control the ship with the computers now up and running, but the astronauts had messed with some of the engine parts during the previous flight and not everything was working correctly.Wes still hadnt seen Calvin or his dog because he was chasing down a couple of bags that had tumbled out of an open locker."I feel like an airline stewardess putting everyones junk in the overhead compartments," Wes grumbled to himself as he shoved bags into the lockers and slammed them shut.The bay door closed seconds before Calvin reached it in his effort to get out of the ship.Gavin came back in the cockpit to see Mabok wrestling with the controls."Are all the doors shut?"Mabok asked."Yeah," Gavin answered, "Hows it going?""You left a couple valves closed when you landed and Im having a hard time maneuvering.""Which ones?""It's the Glorkin Sal and Vindergut Sal," Mabok replied."The what?""The Glorkin... "Mabok started to repeat himself, and then stopped, "The big lever on the large metallic box needs to be pulled back, and the red handle on the large pipe on the very bottom of the engine needs to be turned.""Right," Gavin said, and dashed towards the back.He lost his balance and crashed into the wall a couple times as the ship lurched back and forth."The lever on the metallic box... "Gavin mumbled to himself.As we went back, he noticed a breathless Calvin running up to him with a dog."What are you doing here?"Gavin asked incredulously.Calvin didnt know what to say, but just stood there speechless.Gavin knew by his expression that Calvin wanted to get off."We cant land now," Gavin said, "Or well never be allowed to take off again.Can you stay with us for a little while?""I guess so," Calvin said."Glad to have you, then," Gavin said, "Im Gavin. "He pointed at Wes, hard at work with the baggage."Start putting these bags into that locker over there.Hey, by the way, do you need anything for the trip?""Well," Calvin answered thoughtfully, "I already got my pocketknife with me.I should be fine."The Pinak was now steadily climbing into the sky.All that could be seen from Calvins farm now were the three glowing engines receding into the distance."Gavin, I had a little trouble with the door," Wes said as Gavin dashed past and disappeared into the engine room without responding."I can see youre busy so Ill tell you later," Wes said, more to himself than to anyone else.He turned to Calvin, who just shrugged.Frank poked his head through the airlock."Hey guys!"Frank said excitedly, "There are windows in the cockpit and the views great!"Wes and Calvin jumped up and followed Frank forward.When Gavin arrived at the cockpit, everyone else was already there.Mabok was working hard at the controls, and everyone else was glued to the windows.Gavin had to squeeze past a couple of people to get up to Mabok.Outside, the sky was no longer blue, but starting to turn purple as they neared the outer reaches of the atmosphere.Mabok turned to Gavin and said, "Youd better get ready for weightlessness.Were almost to orbit, so I suggest you prepare yourselves.""Right."Gavin turned to the others."Okay, everybody, we will be weightless soon, so get out of the cockpit and make sure all your stuff is secured.We dont want anything floating around."The men reluctantly left.Gavin grabbed Jeffs arm as he started to leave."Jeff, I want you to count everybody and start getting them into the spacesuits just in case.Make sure that everybody already knows how to get a suit on.""Sure."Gavin sat down on one of the three seats at the controls and buckled himself in.He watched out the window for several minutes while Mabok piloted the ship.Then Mabok turned to him, "Ready?"he asked.Gavin tightened his belt and nodded."Ready."Mabok eased a stick forward and Gavin felt his body slowly rise out of the seat.It seemed like it was being pulled upward.His stomach felt like it was smashing against his lungs.As they transitioned into weightlessness, some of the other passengers were not quite ready for what was happening.Jeff had them all in the equipment bay."Whoa!""Oh boy.""Whats going on?"Cliff smiled at the others comments.He was holding onto a handrail on the wall of the bay and it kept him from floating off, but some of the others had nothing to keep them from flying around and they literally bounced off the walls."Okay, everybody," Cliff called, "Calm down and let's get these suits on."Gavin turned to see Jeff floating up the ladder into the cockpit."Gavin," Jeff said, "Weve got twenty six men, counting you and Mabok.""Good," Gavin replied."There are some problems, though.""Whats that?""We only have enough suits for twenty.""Wow," Gavin said, "It looked like we had enough suits for everybody and their dog.""There is that too," Jeff said."What?""Calvins dog. "8Cliff got out of his bunk, but he felt like he had been run over.He looked down at his hand.It was wrapped up, and it felt like it had been blown up like a balloon.His stomach was clawing at him for some food, so he wearily drifted up into the kitchen and grabbed a packet."Cliff," Jose yelled, "Youre alive!""Barely," Cliff answered.***"Guys," Jose said, climbing into the cockpit, "What do you say we go back to Earth.""Back?"Gavin asked.Frank came up the ladder and stood behind Jose."Weve been talking and we think we should head home.We're serious."Gavin sighed."Let's find out what everyone else thinks.""Everyone agrees," Frank answered, "except Jeff.He says hell do whatever you want.""Gavin," Cliff said from behind Frank, "I could lead you back, now that Ive taken some readings with the telescope.""Maybe that is the best thing to do," Gavin conceded.***Down in the sleeping quarters a dull game of Fish was ongoing.On the wall was a big piece of drafting paper with everyones name on it.Below their names were tallies for each game they had won.Wes led as he stowed away a set of swordfish."Thats sixty two wins so far!"Wes bragged as he tallied up another win."Not even Frank can compete with my all powerful mind.""Ah, be quiet, Wes!"Joe called from his bunk, "You just have a fishy mind, thats all.""Man, Im sick of this stupid game!"Javier grumbled, tossing cards across the room, "And Im sick of the stupid gruel!Weve been in this metal coffin for three months already!""Dont call the Shark a metal coffin!"Wes warned."Shark bait, more like it!"Javier retorted."It is getting pretty boring," Calvin said."Three months ago we were on Earth," Javier said wearily, "Beautiful South Dakota!""When you were there, you said it was the worst place youd ever seen!"Joe sneered."The grass, fields, clouds," Javier said as he gazed off into the air with a smile, ignoring Joes remark.Then he snapped out of it."Three months of boredom," Javier complained, "Waiting.Waiting for what?All we waited for this time was just to get ambushed by the Purples.""Well," Frank said as he entered the room, "Now were just going to be waiting to get home.Gavin agreed to head back.""Yes!"Javier cheered."Gavin says well leave in the morning," Jeff said as he came in the sleeping quarters, "Everyone on Gavins shift needs to be up in eight hours.Everyone else, you have a little time to yourselves before we start fixing this place up.All this junk floating around is starting to get hazardous.""Tell me about it," Wes called as he gathered the fish cards, "I bumped my head on someones duffel bag this morning and about knocked myself out!"***Several hours later the Shark was silent.Everyone lounged around, mostly sleeping.Calvin was relaxing in his bunk when Baker, who now was pretty good at moving around, started barking."Baker!"Calvin yelled, annoyed.Baker kept barking."Calvin!Keep that dog quiet, will you?"Javier growled from his bunk.Calvin got up and looked for Baker.He wasnt in the room, but he sounded like he was in the equipment bay.Calvin didnt bother to put his boots on and floated through the airlock.As soon as he was inside the bay, a hand clapped around his mouth.He looked around in surprise.Purple Men!***"I dont really care about your hunting stories, Wes," Jose grumbled.Both men were floating in the kitchen of the Shark."Yeah, but let me tell you about... "Wes started to say, but stopped.A Purple Man was in the hatchway of the kitchen with a gun pointed at them.Jose and Wes looked at the Purple and then at each other."Ill tell you about the time I was staring down the muzzle of some purple guys gun," Wes finished."I hope this one ends good," Jose said as the Purple Man shoved them through the hatch and followed behind them.***Two high ranking Purple Men looked at the Red prisoners, who were bound to the bay wall.One strolled back and forth in the bay, occasionally throwing a look at the Reds.Gavin looked up when they brought Cliff into the bay."Cliff," he said, "I thought you were on lookout.How come you didn't spot them coming?""I did," Cliff said as they tied his hands and feet."But the intercoms weren't working, so I couldn't tell you."One of the two Purple Man officers started talking to them.Even the ones who didn't know the language seemed to get the main idea by the tone in the man's voice."I am Lod, Liaison Officer for the pursuit division of the Sixth Fleet," he said, and hesitated a little for a response.If he wanted to inspire awe with his introduction, he didnt get much."You thought you could get away from the Jaka," he said proudly, "The best trained space force in history.You thought you could outsmart us?"He pointed at the other Purple Man behind him, "No one escapes him.That's Krid Zaff, commander of the pursuit division of the Sixth Fleet.You were pretty stupid to be caught so easily, but what do you expect from a bunch of primitive criminals?"Lod let out a laugh, "And you left a trail that even a child could follow!I was warned that you were dangerous, but this," Lod looked at them piercingly, "This was hardly worth our efforts. "Lod stopped when he noticed Denz and Mabok."And you," he said as he glared at them, "By helping these Reds, you've sealed your fate.You're going to wish you were never born."Lod raised his hand to strike them, but Krid Zaff stopped Lod with a terse command.Lod lowered his hand and Krid left the room.Two Purple Man guards took up positions in the bay with guns at the ready."It looks bad, guys," Gavin said."I dont think they can make the charges stick," Wes said, "I didnt get to hear my rights.""Or a phone call," Javier said wryly."Man," Jose said despairingly, "Id like a cheeseburger right about now."***Krid Zaff walked down the hall and mumbled to his aide, "Lods little speech is the first time he has ever said anything good about me."They were interrupted as Lod shouted after them."Yes, Lod?"Krid asked and turned to wait.Soon Lod caught up."Set course for the Political Prison station," Lod commanded."The Political Prison?"Krid asked, astonished, "That is for spies and saboteurs.These prisoners should go to a military prison camp.""The Oligarchs have stated that these Reds are spies and saboteurs," Lod answered."I will ask my superiors in the Sixth Fleet to confirm this," Krid said."There is no need," Lod said, holding out a clipboard, "This is a direct command from the Liaisons to you, Zaff, stating that you must take the Reds to the Political Prison."Krid stared at the clipboard, with his jaw clenched."Dont worry, Zaff," Lod said, "They'll be in good hands."Krid sighed and his aide looked at him and began to ask, "So, to the Political Prison?"Krid nodded reluctantly, and the aide turned to go and set the course."One more thing, Zaff," Lod said."I will need to stay at the prison with the prisoners to help in their interrogation.I wont be able to go with you. ""Thats the best news Ive heard all day," Krid said."Oh, dont worry," Lod said quickly, "My superiors will supply another Liaison to go with you when you leave the prison.Also, be assured that I will rejoin you before the invasion of the Reds planet."***The next few days were tiring for the crew, who were tied up, barely fed, and roughly treated.The worst punishment, however, wasnt mistreatment, but the fact that they didnt separate the prisoners."Will you knock it off!"Javier shouted."Calm down, nobodys hurting you!"Joe replied angrily."If you keep tapping your fingers, Im going to go crazy," Javier said with a growl."Silence!"Lod commanded as he entered the bay with Krid."Weve arrived at the Political Prison facility, where you will be staying until you provide us the information we want.""Oh, boy," Gavin mumbled.Krid turned to the guards."Get ready, our ships leaving in five minutes."The guards saluted and left with Krid.Different guards entered, but they had black uniforms and a hungry look about them."Liaisons," Denz mumbled to Gavin, and motioned with his head towards them."They're the Oligarchs' minions to make sure everyone does what the Oligarchs want. ""They don't look very nice to me," Gavin mumbled to Denz.Suddenly there was a knock on the bay door.When the Purple guard opened the hatch, there was a loud gunshot and the guard flew across the room.A Red leapt inside with his gun still hot and a knife in the other hand."Chuck!"Wes shouted."Glad to see you!""I dont know if Im glad to see you, Wes," Chuck answered with a smile and let down his gun, "But theres no time for that.Lets get out of here."Sam came behind Chuck."Its all clear!"he said."Good work, Sam," Chuck said, "Now go cover the top hatch and Ill untie these guys.""Chuck," Wes said joyfully, "Howd you get here?""Well, the Purple Men chased down the Buccaneer and we ended up getting captured and coming here.Once we got here, well, lets just say we managed to escape," Chuck said as he started cutting their straps with his knife."And if I told you all about it then youd never forgive me.I had to do a little dirty dealing."So the Purple Men caught up with you, too?"Gavin asked."Yeah, they caught up with us in the Buccaneer, but before that, we made it back to Earth in one piece and got some more men to come with us.""It was a good thing you weren't there," Sam cut in, "The Colonel was really mad at you. ""Then we started attacking under this general named Monterrey who was given charge of the whole thing," Chuck continued."You should have seen it, we took five enemy ships!We had a whole fleet.But it was too hard to manage a large force, so we scattered and tried our luck separately.""Where are the rest of the guys?"Wes asked."We were the only ones from our original group on board the Buccaneer," Chuck said, lowering his eyes, "Sam and I were the only ones that got out alive.The new guys didnt make it.They were executed here at the prison.This is a dangerous business. "Chuck looked up as he cut the last strap.Everyone was stretching and rubbing their wrists and ankles."We dont have much time, and I dont want to lose anyone else, so lets get the engines going!""Right!"Jeff answered, "Gavins shift, man the engine room.My shift, man the forward maneuvering thrusters.Cliffs shift, man the aft maneuvering thrusters.Denz, you get weapons and help Sam defend the hatch.Lets move!"Denz got up and laughed."Feels great to be free," he chuckled.Then he ripped open some lockers and grabbed weapons and ammo and slung the batteries around his waist, then put on boots and ran up to the hatch.Sam was standing in the hatch behind the cockpit.Gavin was hastily checking the controls.Sam leaned through the hatch and fired his gun, then ducked back in the hatch as a shot hit near him.Denz held up another loaded gun for him and set about reloading the spent one."Power up the maneuvering thrusters!"Gavin yelled.A whining sound came from below, increasing in pitch."Red pipes all the way open!"Gavin shouted back."Red pipes open!"came the reply.Sam leaned through the hatch again and fired, ducking just as another blast hit.He grabbed another gun and fired again, dodging flying dust and debris."Were ready!"Gavin yelled.Sam took a reloaded gun and fired one last time, then ducked inside the hatch and slammed it shut."Were secure!"he said."Fire main engines at fifteen power," Gavin commanded.The ship lurched free of the structure and shook with the roar of the engines.Soon the Purple Man base was behind them.***A signal light flashed out in deep space.Krid lowered his binoculars.He stood on the bridge of his Frigate and thought deeply, then turned to a subordinate."The Reds have escaped in their Pinak," he said."Shall we stand by for pursuit?"the officer asked."We dont have enough fuel for it," Krid said, "Coming way out here to the Political Prison took our last reserves.No, our only choice is to go to the supply depot. "He sat down angrily in a chair, and growled."I knew we should have refueled before heading to the Political Prison, but blast it, Lod wouldnt let me."Another officer still looked through his binoculars."The last of the message, sir," he reported."What is it?""The prison says that the Reds were already sentenced to be executed, so we are ordered to destroy them on sight.Do not negotiate or even board their ship, especially if they offer to surrender.Oligarch Sanzen was at the prison and was assassinated by one of the Reds during their escape.""What was Sanzen doing in the middle of the fighting?"the officer wondered aloud."Sanzen definitely isn't one to shrink from a fight," Krid said, "Even if he is one of the Oligarchs.""Now you see why it is pointless to try and treat the Reds civilly," the new Liaison said, "You shouldn't doubt the decisions of the Liaisons.""The decision of the Liaisons to kill Red civilians got us into this mess," Krid said, "If it weren't for that, we wouldnt be in this predicament.""We can handle this little predicament," the Liaison said, "and let me remind you that if you question the Liaisons like that in front of the men, I'll have you reported.Our job is to make sure the Navy carries out the Oligarchs' wishes, not the old fashioned traditions of the Navy.You don't want to undermine the men's loyalty for the Oligarchs, do you?""Definitely not," Krid said."Good," the Liaison said.Then he left."He sounds exactly like Lod!"Krid mumbled to himself."I thought I was free from his annoying chatter, but all those Liaisons must be taught from the same book."Krid sat silently for a while."How long until we reach the depot?"he asked another officer on the bridge."Twelve hours," the man answered."Blast it!"***"Alright, Cliff," Gavin said as he worked the controls, "Give me the coordinates for home.""I've got some bad news," Cliff said slowly, "They took us so far from our last position that I don't recognize any of the stars.I don't know which way is home."***"Mabok!"Denz called as he came into the kitchen and saw him."Hello, Denz," Mabok replied as he prepared some food."It has been good to have another Purple Man here to talk with," Denz said as he grabbed a packet of food and leaned back."So what do you think of these Reds, huh?""Very strange," Mabok said, "I am amazed that they get anything to work without the computer.""Yes, thats true," Denz replied with a nod, "But I like it.They get down to the basics, and dont mess with the frills."Mabok nodded in agreement."Take Cliff, for example, he draws up maps on paper, and not many Purple Men could do that.They spend most of their time looking out the windows.Can you believe that?Most of our people spend their time looking at screens.""It is much harder to do it their way," Mabok said."Yes," Denz agreed, "But I like their way better.I want to be how they are.They learn about the stars and planets by first hand experience, while we just learn what the screens tell us.""If the computers had been on more, we would know where we are now."The two Purple Men paused for a little bit.All of the chatter on the intercom had stopped.Denz and Mabok left the kitchen to see what was happening and headed through the airlock into the cockpit.Gavin was standing alone in the center of the cockpit.With just a few gestures, and a wave of his hand, the ship rolled over.The motion stopped with another sweep of his hand.After a few moments, they noticed a mirror fastened to the airlock hatch behind them.Denz leaned over and saw Jeff in the room below.He was imitating Gavins every move as he watched in the mirror.Denz looked at Mabok with a doubtful expression.They floated down the ladder into the exercise room.Jeff glanced at them, but kept looking at Gavin through the mirror, imitating his hand signals.Denz and Mabok stood to either side of Jeff and looked over his shoulders.They could see Gavin in a mirror above, but they could also see men back in the engine room, through a series of open hatches.The Reds in the back of the ship were watching Jeff and running the rear thrusters based on his signals.Two men were also controlling thrusters in the exercise room to either side of Jeff."What are you doing?"Denz asked when it seemed they had stopped."Controlling the ship without intercoms," Gavin said."The blasted things keep quitting when we need them the most.""See," Denz said, "They're crazy!"15Before long, Gavin and Jeff sat in a group of men in a gun bay on board the flagship.The flagship itself was a Slok that had been captured from the Purple Men somehow.Gavin was talking to the man next to him when the man suddenly jerked upright and saluted.So did the rest of the men.Gavin and Jeff looked around doubtfully."Whats all this snapping and saluting?"Gavin asked.Some of the men around them glared at them and motioned for them to stand up, so they did.They saw a portly gentlemen stride into the room in his magnetic boots.He returned the salute and motioned for everyone to sit down."Men," the general started, "I want to tell you about the enemy we will be facing today.As you know, the Purple Men came to this planet to kill and to destroy us, and that is what they have done.Our people were massacred as they tried to repel the invaders.Then, through blood and sweat we were finally able to defeat the Purple Men and drive them off the Earths surface."Luckily, some abandoned Purple Man ships fell into our hands, but we didnt know what to do with them.We had no leadership and no vision of how to protect the Earth with these new weapons.Some fruitlessly tried to use the captured vessels, but to no good end.Our ships were chased and battered from star system to star system.Then, the enemy captured one of our ships called Buccaneer.Gentlemen, no man survived from the valiant crew of the Buccaneer.The Purple Men killed every last one after they had thrown down their arms.""He must not know that Sam and Chuck were captured," Jeff murmured to Gavin."However," the general said, straightening proudly, "That was when we began to see the need for leadership and strength.That is why I am here, men.Ever since I came out here into space to lead the forces of Earth in the glorious cause of freedom, I have never lost a battle.I repeat, I have never lost a battle.I want you to know that I never will.As long as I am alive to fight the Purple Men, not one of them will set one foot upon our soil.Not one."Here is my plan, men.The Purple Men are overconfident and they are cowards.They must hide behind their advanced technology.I have the heart and soul of a fighting man, which is something they do not have.Instead of waiting for the invaders to attack me, I am going to attack them.They will not expect me to move first, but I will, and I will hit them so hard they will never stop running until they get home.I am going to drive our fleet in a column right into the middle of their formation.I will then be able to use the cannons on both the starboard and port sides of my ships.Since a fighting ship normally only uses the guns on one side, I will thus be able to attack them with the same firepower as a fleet twice this size.I am counting on surprise, speed, and courage.Who is with me?"The group of men cheered loudly to signal their support."Thats the spirit!"yelled the general.Gavin raised his hand, and the general motioned for him to speak.The rest of the men quieted down."What's our plan for a loss of communications?"he asked."Loss of communications?"Monterrey repeated, confused."When we lose our intercoms," Gavin explained."They always jam our intercoms."Gavin and Jeff could tell by the blank stares that the men here didn't know what they were talking about."Have we thought about a backup plan?"Jeff asked, "The Sixth Fleet is composed almost entirely of Frigates and Gallaxeons.On the other hand, our fleet has only one Slok and the rest are Pinaks.If we get outgunned, what is our plan for retreat?""What are you talking about, Sloks and Pinaks?"a man asked from nearby."And whats this about the Sixth Fleet?""They don't know those terms," Jeff whispered to Gavin."You know, I am starting to get a little worried about this plan," Gavin said, "We might not be ready to do this.""Right," Jeff said, "I think we have a better chance of fighting these guys over the long term.We shouldn't risk losing all of our ships in one battle.We should take advantage of our speed and maneuverability.Hit and run tactics will be what we can do best with PinaksI mean small ships."General Monterrey scowled."Boys," he said to Gavin and Jeff, "I appreciate your ideas, but we dont have time to debate this thing.I am sure that what we need now is a show of strength.That is what they arent expecting.I plan to hit them hard and put them out of the game.""Now," the general said to the rest of the group, "The first and last craft in our attack column will be the most important ships in my attack fleet.I am going to put my flagship, the Dreadnought, in the last place to cover the rear of our column and prevent any counterattacks.We need a good crew in the first ship to begin the attack."Monterrey turned back to Gavin and Jeff, "You seem to have a lot of fancy ideas.Ill trust you to be in the lead with your ship, the uh""The Shark," Jeff said."Right," Monterrey grumbled."Now, lets get my fleet ready for this attack.Remember men, everything depends on this one battle.Everyone on Earth is waiting and hoping for my victory.I will defeat these invaders.I am going to make every one of the Purple Men suffer for what they did to the Buccaneer.""Remember the Buccaneer!"A few minutes later, Gavin and Jeff climbed aboard the Shark and helped transfer several containers of ammunition into the hold from another pirate Pinak."Who does this Monterrey think he is?"Jeff asked as they worked."He certainly seems to think highly of himself," Gavin said."Yeah.Its funny that he never mentioned how we were the ones who captured the Shark and started this whole thing.""I don't think he knows a lot about space battle.He hasn't thought this out very well.""I agree.Do you think we should go along with it?"Gavin paused for a few minutes to ponder the question."Theyre going to need all the help they can get," Gavin finally said."But if anything goes wrong, we can always make a run for it.""Okay," Jeff said."Ill go with you.Lets just hope Monterrey doesn't mess everything up."***On the flagship of the Sixth Fleet, there was another briefing taking place.Purple Man officers filed into the room and took their seats.Krid walked down the familiar corridors of the huge Gallaxeon and entered the room."Krid!"called an officer named Greggan, "My friend, youre back!"Greggan slapped Krid on the back and gave a laugh."Good to see you, Krid," said another officer."The fleet isnt the same without you," Greggan said."Is it better or worse when Im not around?"Krid asked with a smile."Its certainly much more boring," said Greggan."Im glad youre here for the battle.""It doesnt seem like there will be much of a battle to me," Krid said."But I bet you're glad to get your squadron back. "Greggan said, "Your ships will be right next to mine in the battle formation.""Attention!"someone shouted.The Admiral of the Sixth Fleet came to the front of the room and outlined the tactical details of the Reds pirate fleet while the officers jotted down information.Then the Chief Liaison took the floor."This isnt just a routine battle," the Liaison said, "We are here to make a show of those who dare oppose us.We want Reds to forever remember and fear the fate of the pirates we will be fighting today.The Jaka have been humiliated and defeated once on this world.We must make sure that doesnt happen again or our people will never be safe here.I am confident that we will succeed.After all, I think everyone knows that the Sixth Fleet is the most respected naval force in the known galaxy.Once you smash the Red pirates as the Admiral has outlined, we will move forward with our plans for invasion."The Chief Liaison projected a picture of an Earth city on a screen and continued, "We have already chosen the city for our first strike.Your mission will be to deliver our troops to the surface to totally annihilate this metropolis.The remaining Reds will be forced to submit to our will or suffer the same fate as this city.This way, we will finally be able to restore order to this planet."The Admiral stood up quickly and said, "Ive just received word that the pirates are on the move.Everyone to your ships."***After stowing the ammunition on the Shark, Gavin told the men about General Monterreys attack plan.No one said much, but left to get everything ready.Joe pulled on his space suit carefully, checking it for leaks or damage.He put a picture of his family in his pocket.He then checked his gun and knife to make sure they would work in the battle ahead.He gathered up all of his personal belongings from his bunk and stuffed them in a bag.He pulled out a letter for his family that he had written just in case he died and placed it in the top of the bag."Theres North America!"called Jose from the cockpit.Joe went up to see it with some of the others."Its so close," Joe said, "I would give anything to be able to get down there.""Theres California," Jose said, "I can almost see my house!""Okay, men," Gavin said as he entered the cockpit, "Get ready.Were starting to move out.""To think that we are so close," Joe said, still looking at the Earth, "but we might not live to see it again."***In single file, the pirate ships cruised boldly toward the lurking battleships of the Purple Man fleet."Open the bay doors," Jeff called.The bay doors on the pirate ships slid open to reveal the grim guns and dim faces of the warriors from Earth."Load the cannons," Jeff ordered.The men brought up the gas cylinders and power cables and loaded the cannons."Get ready to fire," Jeff called out.The men cranked the cannons up to the edge of the bay doors.
