All of the ships we've seen so far are the same gray color.""It has to be the Jaka!"Denz said as he entered the cockpit, "No one else would be out here.""Good," Gavin said, turning the Pinak around and firing the engines."Get a gun crew ready!"Jeff yelled down the hatch, and several men scrambled out of their bunks."You know, as a kid," Gavin said a few minutes later, "I always wanted to be a pirate, but now I just think of them as criminals.""Well, Gavin," Denz said, "I prefer to think of us as privateers.We aren't stealing ships just for the money, but we're fighting for our people.""Yeah," Gavin answered, "That works better for me.""The money certainly doesn't hurt, though," Denz added with a grin."I'll take the controls, since you don't know the computer very well."They sat silently for a while, as the ship got closer.After fifteen minutes, instead of a bright speck, Gavin could start to see its shape.Jeff went to the equipment bay.Denz swung the ship around sideways so that the gun could fire at the ship.So far it looked like the enemy hadnt spotted them.Cliff came into the cockpit.Gavin leaned back to shout through the cockpit hatch at the other men."Tell them they can open the bay door now!"Jeff heard from inside the bay, slammed the airlock shut, and started to crank the bay door open.The gun crew was ready with their suits on and already standing by the gun.Just as they were about to start firing, the lights on the Pinak flickered and the ship started turning around.The enemy ship was drifting out of their gun sights."What are you doing?"Jeff called on his intercom to the cockpit, "Stop turning the ship!""I'm not doing it," Gavin called back."We're having trouble with the controls!"Just then all of the lights went out."They have control of our computer," Denz said to Gavin, frustration in his voice, "Get your cyber attackers to lock the Jaka out of the power controls.""Cyber attackers?"Gavin asked, confused."Whoever does your computer security," Denz explained.Gavin just looked at him blankly."Who was the one who knocked out the computer on the Buccaneer when you captured it?"Denz asked."No one," Gavin answered."No one?"Denz exploded, "You don't have any one sending virus attacks at the enemy?""Nope.""How did you keep the enemy from getting access to all of your computerized controls before?"Denz asked, starting to panic.***Meanwhile, Jeff got the gun crew to crank the gun around to follow the enemy ship as the Pinak kept rotating.Joe aimed the cannon and fired, but just then something exploded in the back of the equipment bay, just behind the gun crew."They overloaded the gas generator by remote control!"Denz called on the intercom.Debris flew everywhere and gas rushed out of several ruptured pipes.Frank rushed to close the gas valves, and the gas stopped leaking.When the debris and gas cleared from the bay, the enemy ship was still there.It didnt seem to be damaged.Joe must have missed."You were never a very good shot," Jeff said to Joe, who had been aiming the cannon.Jeff started cranking the gun back into place."Im hurt," Joe replied on his intercom."Joe, you know I was just kidding about being a lousy shot," Jeff said, turning to face Joe.Jeff stopped short when he saw Joe clutching his arm with a grimace of pain."Oh, you mean youre wounded!"Jeff exclaimed."Ive got a leak," Joe gasped.Jeff grabbed Joes other arm and rushed over to the airlock with him floating behind.Some men took their places beside the cannon and Jeff saw a flash of light when they fired it.He shut the airlock door and started pumping the air back in.As the air filled the airlock, the ship lurched again and Jeff could hear metal groaning.He turned on his intercom."Gavin!"he called, "Let's get out of here.This isn't working!""They have complete control of the ship now," Gavin said.Everyone looked at each other with a sinking feeling when they heard Gavin say that on the intercom.It seemed like they just lost the battle."Let's go back to manual control," Jeff said as he tried to get Joe into a bunk."Turn off the computer!""You can't operate the ship without a computer," Denz wailed, "You're insane."Gavin shoved him aside and flipped a circuit breaker that shut off all of the computers."Everyone, get to your stations at the thrusters and the engines," Gavin called over the intercom."We're going to do this manually like we did before!"The men scrambled to their posts and took up position.Now there was something they could do about their plight.They all seemed to feel a surge of adrenaline.The fight wasn't over."Full power on the main engines!Yaw left at five power.Now...Now!Pitch up at three power.Now...Now!"The ship lurched forward and swung around.Denz almost fell over in shock."You're flying the ship without any computer safeties?"he gasped."That's right," Gavin said."The men are piloting the vehicle by hand," Denz said in awe as he looked around."One slip and you could easily be destroyed, or crash!I've never seen this before.You're taking your life in your hands in a dangerous vehicle. ""Millions of us do it every day on my planet," Gavin said.As they passed by the enemy ship, Jeffs gun crew kept firing until it went out of sight behind them.Gavin kept the engines at full power until the enemy Pinak was gone.Luckily, they werent being followed.Cliff looked out the side window as the enemy ship disappeared.After an hour, Gavin cut the engines off and left the cockpit.He went to the bunkrooms.Luckily, only Joe had any injuries.Javier had some medical training, so he had been able to stitch up a cut in Joes arm.Gavin went back up to the cockpit and sat down wearily.The enemy had taken over their computer and sabotaged several components on their ship before Gavin had shut the computer off.They could have been easily killed.This piracy wasnt going to be easy.***Six days later, the ship was in orbit around a different planet.Denz told them where they could stop to repair the damage.After firing the engines, they found themselves flying through the atmosphere of the barren planet.Halfway down to the ground, the ship started to get hard to control.Apparently there had been more damage to the engines than they thought.Gavin was barely able to bring the ship down in one piece.As it was, the ship came to rest on a steep hillside, and fell over, then crashed onto its side.The passengers and any loose bags were tossed all over.Cliff and Wes climbed out of the top hatch in their space suits.It was awkward with the ship lying on its side like it was.The sky was very pale, but there was some kind of air, and the sun was shining brightly.They looked around at their surroundings.There was a random smattering of craters and hills.After a few minutes walking around the ship, they headed back inside.Gavin was standing on the cockpit wall, because everything was on its side."The ship looks pretty stable," Wes said."It probably won't shift anymore.""Good," Gavin replied, "Let's get to work and fix this baby up. "A work team suited up and headed outside.It was cold and dry, but it felt nice to have solid ground under their feet.They found that they didn't need to keep their helmets on, and they could talk to each other through their oxygen masks.Denz set to work showing the crew how to repair the damage.***After helping clean up the ship, Gavin headed back into the engine room to see how things were going.He found Denz next to a maze of pipes and valves.Calvin and Jose were sitting next to him.Denz tightened a bolt and leaned back as he opened a valve.Gas sprayed everywhere from one of the joints in the pipe.Denz staggered back as the gas sprayed in his face.Calvin tried to block the spray with his hands so he could get closer to the pipes.The frigid air was beginning to form ice on the machinery around it.Denz wiped his face off and began cursing in his language.Finally Calvin closed the valve, and the high pressure stream of fluid weakened and then slowed until it was just dripping.Denz continued cursing and spitting.Jose leaned down and wiped off a gauge near the valve.Denz blinked and peered at it."Forty!"Denz yelled angrily, "Blast it!We have to fill it all over again.Blast!"***Wes was standing on the side of the hull by the nose.He had a can in one hand, and a wadded up T shirt in the other.The T shirt was all red, and Wes had red paint smeared all over him."Whats going on, Wes?"Cliff asked."Cliff!"Wes called, "Hey, come on up here!"Cliff climbed up on the hull and walked over to Wes."What are you doing?"Cliff asked as he looked around."Im painting a sharks mouth on the ship!Hows it look?"Cliff then realized what it was.A large gaping black mouth with sharp white teeth, and red outline was painted on the gray hull."I found a bunch of paint stuff that they use to coat engine parts," Wes said, "and I decided that this ship was just too drab, so I painted on a sharks mouth!""Thats pretty nice," Cliff, replied with admiration, "It looks just like those old airplanes.""Yeah!"Wes answered excitedly, "Thats where I got the idea.There werent any brushes, so I used a couple of old shirts."Cliff looked at Wes's handiwork for a few moments."Um, Wes, theres one problem  ""And Im going to paint an eye up there.Itll look just like a shark, because the whole thing is gray, and its shaped kind of like a shark anyway, except that it has corners.The telescope tower looks just like a fin.I might even paint some gill slits farther back.Itll be great!""Wes, shouldnt the mouth be curved down, you know, kind of like a mean scowl or something?""Curved down?"Wes asked, "Oh, yeah it is, see at the corner of the mouth there?""But thats the top of the ship down there," Cliff said, pointing to the top of the hull where the hatch and cockpit windows were."You have the mouth curved up."Wes squinted around, looking at the ship in silence for a long while."Well, you know, with the ship upside down on the slope of the hill and all  That ends at the top, and I thought...Since it sloped up that way, I didnt stop to think about  ""  thats alright, Wes.It doesnt look too bad.Itll be okay."Wes tilted his head sideways to look at his painting.I guess its kind of a toothy grin, isnt it?""Well, it still looks pretty mean to me, with the sharp teeth and all, but it is kind of a goofy smile."Wes looked at the sharks mouth for a while."Ah, who cares?No Purple Man out here knows what it's supposed to look like except us, and well all be inside where we cant see it anyway!"Wes said."Yeah, just paint the eyes and gills and itll look pretty good."Jeff walked up to them, fidgeting with his oxygen mask."I have a suggestion, Jeff," Wes said."Go ahead," Jeff said with a wave of his hand."Seeing as we still dont have a name for our ship," Wes started, "And with my good paint job in mind, I suggest that we name this ship the Shark.""I dont know how you can call that paint job good," Javier grumbled as he walked up behind Jeff."Hey!"Wes replied defensively, "Its pretty nice, you have to admit.""No, I dont," Javier answered."Well," Jeff cut in, "Any objections to Shark?"There was silence and a few shrugs."Okay, Shark it is," Jeff said, "And now lets get back to more important work.We're going to use the thrusters to tip this thing over and get out of here."***"Looks like some kind of vacuum cleaner," Gavin said, turning a gun over in his hands.Jeff shook his head and fired the device at the wall.A projectile flashed through the air trailing a cable.A reel on the bottom of the device let out the wire with a whine.Then the projectile stuck securely to wall.Jose, who was standing nearby, tried to pull it off of the wall, but it stayed tight.Jeff smiled and pressed a button and the projectile detached and fell to the ground."Its a kind of grappling hook!"Gavin said excitedly.Jose placed the hook near the side of the ship and it stuck to the hull with a pop."How does it stick?"Jose asked."I don't know," Jeff replied, "but I have the perfect plan for using these.""They sure could make fishing easier," Wes grumbled, and rubbed his large stomach."Call the men together and I'll tell them the plan," Jeff said to Gavin, "And Denz, see how many more of these we have. "***"I think the plan will work, Gavin," Jeff said."I cant think of anything that can go wrong," Jose said."Well," Wes added, "It is complicated, but itll certainly work better than what we tried last time."The conversation was interrupted by a flash of light and a blast of hot air.A crackling rumble came from the other side of the Shark.They all leapt in the air and Jeff sprinted around and slid to a stop on the other side.A blackened crater lay next to the Shark, with smoke still drifting up and dust everywhere.Jeff pulled out his gun and scanned the horizon.Gavin came behind him.Denz followed and put his hand on Gavins shoulder."I told you not to put the propellant and primer close together!"he told Gavin, pointing to the crater."You lost twenty cannon rounds.""How... "Gavin stammered."The propellant and primer for the cannon," Denz explained, "You put them together, and Boom!Thats why we keep them on separate sides of the bay.If you put them close by each other, they will explode.Were lucky no one was hurt.How are we going to defeat the Jaka when you can't follow simple instructions!"***Outside the windows of the cockpit the blackness of space drifted by lazily.It was the last day of a long week.They had expected to see action and battle shortly after launch, but it hadn't materialized.Out of sight below the ship, sunlit craters and mountains of a windswept world were passing by slowly.The lazy feeling in the ship was shattered when Cliff called from the telescope tower farther back in the ship."Incoming ship!"Cliff yelled."You can probably see it through the cockpit windows."Gavin grabbed binoculars.Soon he had spotted it also.After gauging the distance to the other ship and the planet, Gavin smiled to himself.They were in a perfect position to execute their new plan.Down in the bunkroom, the men sprang to action, scattering playing cards everywhere.Excitement charged the air as the men climbed into their gear and hastily prepared the ship for action.***Cliff, Gavin, and Jeff sat in the cockpit tensely.All the men were waiting at their posts."Should be any time now.""Do you think we got the timing wrong?"Gavin said, checking some gauges."I hope not," Cliff answered.Light shone through the cockpit windows and lit the cockpit brilliantly.A thin crescent was all that could be seen of the planet below, which was now a lot farther away.Then, the light suddenly faded.The sun was disappearing behind the planets edge.Soon only a sliver of light could be seen, and then the sun vanished.Gavin reached up and shut off the cockpit lights.Cliff could only see a few dim instruments glowing red in the control panel at first.After a few moments he could see the stars through the windows."Lights out!"Jeff yelled.The faint glow coming up through the floor hatch in the airlock behind them was suddenly extinguished.Now everything was pitch black except for the stars and dim instrument lights.Frank was glad that he had learned how to operate his thruster blindfolded, because now he had to.He thought about Sam, who had trained with him, and wondered if he and the others on the Buccaneer were home yet."Stay on the lookout," Jeff called through his headset to Javier, who was outside of the top hatch with binoculars attached to his helmet.The ship was eerily silent for many minutes.Everyone stood motionless at their posts and didnt utter a word."Guys," Jeff called, starting to feel nervous in the silence and darkness, "You can talk all you want.They cant hear us.""Im not taking any chances," Wes called from the maneuvering thruster right below the cockpit."Its a vacuum outside, Wes," Jeff called, "Sound doesnt travel through it.""Thats what you think," Wes replied."I see something coming around the planet.Its still in the sunlight," Javier called through the intercom."Small object moving at three thirteen, forty five!"Gavin jumped to look out the windows and gave commands to turn the ship to the coordinates.He aimed the nose of the Shark right at the enemy vessel."We see it," Gavin called."Fire the main engines, men.""Are you sure they cant see the engine exhaust?"Cliff asked."Were pointed right at them, so the ships hull should block the light coming from the engines," Gavin answered."Anyway, well know soon enough.""Id say its about four miles away," Javier called through the intercom.Gavin looked at his watch."Cut the engines," Gavin told the men, who pulled the throttles back."Clear the main fuel lines!"Jeff yelled back."The ship just went into the planets shadow," Javier called."Stay calm, everybody," Jeff called out, "They cant see us.""Javier," Gavin called, "Tell me when you can see it.""Im looking," Javier answered.The cockpit was unbearably dark and quiet for several minutes."I see it!"Javier called excitedly."Stars are blinking out at six twenty one and one ten!And theres light combing from a window.""Turning to those coordinates!"Gavin said, and gave the command to fire the maneuvering thrusters, which were positioned on the four corners of the Shark.Fortunately the maneuvering thrusters didnt spit out a visible flame like the main engines, so Gavin still didnt have to worry about the approaching ship seeing any light that would give away their position.As he finished his turn, he saw several stars wink out, and then he saw a black silhouette in the sky.Light came out of a window in the black silhouette."I see it!"Gavin called."Now well get even closer and hope they dont spot us."Gavin was anxious and sweating from the strain.He gave orders to the men as they inched closer to the silhouette in the stars.It was getting bigger."Get ready to turn," Gavin said."Lights out in the right hand bay!"Jeff shouted, "Open the door!""Yaw left at five power," Gavin said."Now!"The Shark was pointed straight at the shadow.Then it silently swung around so that the right hand equipment bay would be pointed at the other ship."Cancel the yaw...Now!""About two hundred yards!"Javier called.Gavin bit his lip as he concentrated hard.Javier called out periodically from his lookout post."One hundred yards!""Really close!"Javier felt like the other ship should be able to see them.He could see a telescope tower and a blocky shape."How long do we have, Cliff?"Gavin asked.Cliff looked at his watch."About ten minutes until the sun comes out," Cliff answered."Wed better hurry," Gavin replied."Looks like about fifty feet!"Javier called."Do you see it from the bay?"Jeff called on his headset as he floated downstairs and headed for the equipment bay."We see it!"came the reply from the equipment bay."Joe, Jose, and Denz, leave your thrusters and get to the bay quick!"Jeff called."Ready, Gavin?"Jeff asked."Ready," Gavin answered."How about you, Javier?"Jeff called over the intercom."Looks good from here!"Javier answered.Jeff took a deep breath."Okay," he called over his headset, "Fire the grappling hooks!"Seven men stood abreast in the equipment bay in the open doorway.They each held up a grappling hook and fired.With a lurch, seven hooks shot out and flew straight towards the black shape.Jose felt the vibration from the grappling hooks gun as the spool of cable unwound.Then the vibration stopped, and the cable went loose."Mine is secure," Jose called out.***The Purple Man Captain Kom floated in his bunk on board the other ship.He heard several clangs come from the engine room and felt the ship lurch slightly.He thought the crewmen were messing around.He hoped that they hadnt broken something loose or damaged anything.He turned back to a report and kept reading."...this suspicious activity requires that all ships, even freighters, maintain a full alert at all times," the report read, "Recently, a Jaka Pinak reported that a ship approached without identifying itself.It is likely that the ship was manned by Red pirates from a newly discovered planet.A battle ensued in which the Jaka Pinak was able to disable the pirates with a cyber attack.However, even with a fully successful computer takeover, the pirates were still able to fire their cannon and control their ship.The Jaka Pinak suffered several hits before the pirates escaped.It is possible that they have a new type of computer warfare that we don't understand."Captain Kom stuffed the report into a locker and turned off his bunk light.The government was getting fanatical again.He figured he didnt really need to keep the men on full alert.He'd tell the men in the morning.***The seven Reds grabbed a tether and clipped it onto a cable.They released their magnetic boots from the floor, and gripped the cable in one gloved hand, their stolen alien guns in the other.Denz had helped train the men on how to load the guns with gas, charge them with power, and fire them.Each man had a belt of gas cartridges and a battery strapped to their hip to reload their guns."Go!"Jeff called over his headset.The men started floating along the cables, helping themselves along with their left hands while they gripped their guns with their right.Joe didn't get far before he came back."My arm is still hurting too bad," Joe said to Jeff, who nodded."Next group, ready to go," Jeff called.He took up position by a cable along with the rest of the crew.They got ready to slide along the cables after the first seven men were safely on the enemy ships hull.***Purple Man First Mate Kren felt a strange swaying motion in the floor of his ship.He looked down at the freighters control panel."Sir," he called out, "Im getting radio transmissions from nearby.""Where?"the second mate asked."It seems like an intercom outside the ship at about a hundred feet," Kren answered."Probably just some reflected signals," the second mate said, "Don't worry about it."***"Two minutes to sunrise," Cliff called at the same moment on the Sharks intercom.***On board the freighter, Kren had to shade his eyes when the sun came out from behind the planet.In a few seconds, the full strength of the suns light was beating down on him through the cockpit window.As he let his eyes adjust, he heard the top hatch open and close, and then the airlock started pumping.He casually looked through the small window and saw several men in the airlock.He looked again in shock at their faces.The men were Reds!He started towards the ships control panel, but one of them held his gun up to the window.If the Red fired, it would shatter the glass and let the air out, and Kren didnt have a space suit.He held his hands up and walked away from the control panel.A few moments later the airlock clicked open and the men came out.One of them pushed Kren and the second mate to the wall and pointed his gun at them.Then they waited and four more Reds got into the airlock from outside and started filling it.***Captain Kom heard other bunk panels opening and closing nearby.It must be time for the next watch.The Captain looked at his clock.There was still another hour left for them to sleep.Could the crew be getting up early?He reached over to open the panel to his own bunk, but it slid open before he could touch it, and a Red was floating there.The Red had his helmet off.At first sight, the Captain could see why they were called Reds.The man was pinkish tan, not a normal pale color.The Red raised a gun to point at him, and the Captain knew it was over.He cringed and waited for the shot, but it didnt come.He opened his eyes again.The Red hadnt fired.The reports had said that they were bloodthirsty criminals, but to his surprise, this Red hadnt killed him yet.The Red motioned for the Captain to get out of the bunk.Several other Reds were waking up the crew and forcing them into the cargo hold.Soon the Captain was in the hold with them and a Red walked up to him."We will put you down on the planet," Gavin said to the Captain.The crew was amazed that he spoke their language."You wont be hurt unless you resist."Now Captain Kom knew why they were called savages.The Reds were going to maroon his crew down on the planet and let them slowly die without oxygen.These pirates were worse than the stories about them.***The Purple Man crew of the freighter waited listlessly in the small crater on the surface.The Reds had taken them down to the planet and left them in this bowl shaped depression.Several Red guards were standing on the rim of the crater with guns at the ready.Captain Kom reached in his magnetic boot and pulled out a small transmitter."Dont worry, men," he said into his space suit headset, "I smuggled an emergency radio with me.There was another ship close behind us.Its a Navy Slok, which is a warship almost twice as big as the pirates Pinak.One quick call and the Slok should be bearing down on the pirates at full speed.""Good thinking, Captain," Kren said over his headset.Kom turned some knobs and dials on the small radio.He started transmitting on the radio using a code similar to Morse code.***In the large cockpit of the Slok, a Purple Man crewman quickly detected the message."Captain!"he called."What is it, Lieutenant," the Captain answered as he strolled over to him."We're picking up an emergency transmission.""What is it?""It's the code for hijacking.It's coming from the Valtari system.""Plot a course for Valtari at high speed," The Captain called to the man piloting the Slok."Captain," the Lieutenant said, "I'm getting a message in standard code on the same frequency.I'll copy it down.It's from the freighter Condor.""That's Captain Kom's ship," the Captain mumbled.After a few minutes, the Lieutenant was done copying down the message."What does the full message say," the Captain of the Slok asked.The Lieutenant pointed to the screen."MAYDAY, MAYDAY," the message said, "FREIGHTER CONDOR HIJACKED IN THE VALTARI SYSTEM AT VALTARI THREE.RED PIRATES ATTACKED AT NIGHT FROM LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED METERS.THEIR SHIP WAS IMPOSSIBLE TO DETECT.WE DIDN'T HAVE A CHANCE TO FIGHT.WE'VE BEEN LEFT TO DIE ON THE SURFACE.""Two vessels in sight on the telescope!"a Jaka crewman called to the Sloks captain as he read the report."We're picking up the computer signature of the freighter Condor, so that must be one of them, but we're getting nothing from the other ship's computers."What type of craft is the second ship," the Captain asked, "Can you see in the telescope?""Were so far away that it's impossible to tell what the second ship is.""Lieutenant," the Captain said, "Read me the message we got from the Pinak that was attacked a week or so ago.""ALERT, ALERT," the Lieutenant read, "UNIDENTIFIED VESSEL ENCOUNTERED AND ENGAGED IN THE BERENZ SYSTEM.CYBER ATTACKS SEEMED TO HAVE SUCCEEDED IN TAKING COMPLETE CONTROL OF THE ENEMY VESSEL.HOWEVER, AS WE APPROACHED TO BOARD THE VESSEL, IT'S COMPUTER SIGNATURE ABRUPTLY VANISHED FROM OUR SCOPES AND THE VESSEL TURNED AND FIRED ON US.WHILE WE TRIED TO REACQUIRE THEIR COMPUTER SIGNATURE, THE VESSEL DISAPPEARED.""Hmm," the Captain mumbled as he scratched his chin, "If we can't pick up their computer signature, and cyber attacks are completely ineffective..."***Cliff got into the right side equipment bay of the Shark just as they were attaching cables to what remained of the Soyuz capsule, which was still wedged into the back of the bay.A crane taken from the hold was attached to the edge of the open bay.The cables went from the Soyuz to the crane, and then through some pulleys.Cliff grabbed one of the cables to help out.Lots of men were already gripping them.A few had metal bars and were trying to pry the Soyuz out."Okay," Jeff said over the intercom, "Lets try it again.One, two, three!"The men hauled back on the cables as the others tried to pry the capsule loose.It was hard to pull on the cable.There was no gravity to help by leaning back.With all the men helping, the Soyuz finally scraped loose and pulled away from the wall.Then it slid slowly out of the bay.Once the cables were detached, the other men hauled them back.Cliff looked at the Soyuz and thought back to its first flight.He was a little sad to see the capsule go.Several pieces of debris followed it as it drifted away."Okay!"Jeff called, "Lets get the supplies from the freighter and put them in the bay!"The men filed off to the freighter."Where is the freighter's landing craft we sent the prisoners down in?"Cliff asked Jeff."Our guys should be bringing it back right now," Jeff answered.***"Hold on," the telescope crewman on the Slok called."There is another ship coming into sight that I hadn't seen before. "The telescope man on the Slok, who at such great distance could not tell for sure what the ships were, saw another twinkle of light as the Soyuz drifted away from the Reds Pinak."Another ship!"the Captain gasped, "How many of these pirates ships are there?""There's no way to know if we can't pick up their computer signatures," the Lieutenant said."There could be others hiding in the planet's shadow.That's how they surprised the Condor.""Captain!"a crewman interrupted, "Another transmission...It says, ' DO NOT DELAY.SET COURSE IMMEDIATELY.THEY LEFT US TO DIE.'""They must be warning us to leave so that we are not captured also," the first mate answered, spooked by the ominous message.The Captain stood silently for a while."Set the engines at full power," the captain said quietly, "Let's get away from here.""Yes, sir."***Captain Kom sat on the planet surface and grumbled, "The Slok should have arrived by now.I just sent another message for them to hurry and get here. "The Reds had left in the landing craft long ago."Let's go to higher ground to make sure they can pick up my transmission," Kom said, and motioned to his men to follow and they climbed out of the crater."If the Slok doesnt come soon, well run out of oxygen. "As they cleared the rim, a large stack of crates came into view."Its food, oxygen, and pressure tents!"a man called, as he looked over the crates."The Reds must have left them for us!""We should tell the crew of the Slok," Kren said.Kom looked at the transmitter."The power ran out!We cant call them now."***Reports of the capture of the Condor soon arrived at the Jaka Navy.They sent waves of speculation and rumors among the Purple Men.An invincible, invisible, and murderous fleet of Red pirates could be anywhere.Reports of pirate sightings began coming in all over the galaxy.EpilogueCliff stared out the window of his office at the sun setting behind the nearby mountains."Daydreaming again, huh?"asked a co worker from the cubicle next to him."Yeah," Cliff said, "I just cant concentrate on my work anymore.""Well, Im leaving for the weekend," the co worker said."Youre the last one here, so youll need to lock up for the night again.""Okay," Cliff replied.The co worker studied him for a while."I dont understand you, Cliff," he said, "It seems like your mind is always somewhere else.""Im tired of sitting here at the computer all day.Its just pointless.""Well, Cliff, if you ask me, what you need is to get your feet back on the ground and get on with life.Youve been back from space for a year now, but that is the only thing you think about.I mean, I set you up on a date with a really nice girl last week, but all you talked about was Jupiter.""Whats wrong with Jupiter?""Boring, Cliff, really boring.""I guess so.""Yeah," the co worker said, shaking his head as he turned to leave, "See you on Monday."By the time Cliff left work, it was dark.After leaving and locking the front door, he paused to look up at the stars."Cliff?"a womans voice asked.Cliff jumped a little when he heard it, not expecting anyone to be nearby.He recognized the voice, but couldnt remember where it was from.He turned around to see who it was.A woman was standing on the sidewalk leading up to the building."Yes," Cliff said, looking at the person, "Im Cliff.""I am so glad to have found you," the woman said, "I was hoping that you hadnt gone home yet."The woman walked closer and Cliff suddenly remembered her."Palla!"Cliff said, "What are you doing here?""Looking for you," Palla said."Why?""Denz and Mabok stopped to visit me when they were passing through the star system on their way back to the Jaka planet," Palla said."They told me about the Wadi Kahn.""I was thinking about the Wadi Kahn just today, Palla," Cliff said."I was wondering if I would ever be able to go back.""That is why I am here," Palla said, "You are the only one who knows how to get there.""Oh, I can get us there," Cliff said."Wheres your ship?"Palla paused."I don't have a ship.I only had enough money to have a transport drop me off here.Don't the Reds have some ships now?""Yes," Cliff said, "But they are all off limits.The military owns them now."Palla was downcast."Wait," Cliff said, "There just might be an old ship we could use after all."***Javier drove along a bumpy dirt road in his old Toyota."I cant wait for you to see this, Patty," he told his wife, who was sitting in the passenger seat, "I hope you dont mind coming out here on the way back from our honeymoon to check this out.""I dont mind too much," Patty laughed."When Wes and his wife told me at the wedding that they were going to come out here this weekend to see our spaceship, I just had to come.Look, there he is."Javier pulled the car over and parked on a bare patch of dirt next to Wess truck.Soon the four of them were hiking through the brush over a low hill."Its almost been a year since I saw the Shark," Wes said as they walked, "And boy am I excited to check it out.I told my wife, Susan, that Id show it to her before they scrapped it.""Its been a year, has it?"Javier asked."Yep," Wes said, "Time sure flies, doesnt it?""Are you sure it's still here?"Susan asked."I think I see it right now," Wes said, pointing in the distance.The Shark was still lying where it had crashed.The familiar shape of the spacecraft brought back a myriad of memories to the two men as they approached it.Wes cut through a chain link fence and they slid through."Monterrey never did care too much for this ship," Wes grumbled."You'd think he'd at least give it better security."As they got close to the ship, they heard sounds coming from inside.***Inside the Shark, Cliff flipped a switch and heard the engines roar to life."You did it, Palla!"he shouted with delight."Lets get ready to take off!"Palla stood back from the engine, wiping off her hands.As they turned to walk up to the cockpit, they stopped short.Wes and Javier stood in their way."Did you think you could get away without us?"Javier asked."I guess I couldn't get away without you the first time, either," Cliff said with a smile, "Dont just stand there.Wes, you can open up the main tanks and I need Javier to power up the maneuvering thrusters.""Yes, sir," the two men said simultaneously.***The next Monday, Cliff didnt come back to work.In fact, he never came back to work again.11Cliff and Denz sat in the telescope tower in silence."Im getting depressed," Cliff said, "All I can think about is food.""Me too," Denz said."Tell me about Krid Zaff," Cliff said, "You seemed to know something about him.""Sometimes I forget that you are not Purple Men," Denz said, laughing, "I think you should know about these things.Krid is famous among the Purple Men because of something that happened five years ago.For years, the Jaka had been searching for the Shadow Fleet of the Tonns.The Shadow Fleet had been raiding Jaka outposts and isolated Jaka ships, and the Jaka had to destroy it or they would lose their foothold on that sector.However, every time a large Jaka fleet got close enough to attack the Shadow Fleet, the Tonns would quickly disappear and leave the Jaka with only their discarded equipment as a memento.The Jaka knew that the man who found the Tonns Shadow Fleet would be a hero, and they all wanted the honor.Until then, Krid Zaff, a Ramasian Pinak captain, had been little known in the fleet."Krid Zaff knew that the key to finding the Shadow Fleet was to find their supply depot.The problem was that they moved their supply depot any time the Jaka got close.While all of the other Jaka officers focused on trying to sneak up on the Tonn fleet without being spotted, Krid decided he would get to the supply depot and wait there for the Tonns to come to him.Through amazing shrewdness, and a lot of luck, Krid managed to follow a trail of clues to a camouflaged supply base on a remote planet.To make sure the base belonged to the Tonns, he hid his Pinak behind an asteroid near the supply base.When the Tonns arrived and Krid was sure he had the right place, he left his hideout and headed back to notify his superiors.He thought he hadnt been seen, but before long his crew spotted six Tonn ships encircling them at a distance."As Krid tried racing away, the faster Tonn ships kept up with him and mercilessly bombarded his ship, waiting for Krids men to be worn out so they could board and capture them.Krids crew fought back for hours, even capturing two Tonns who had tried to board his ship.Only Krids wild maneuvers kept the Tonn ships from getting close enough so the rest of their men could board.But, it was only a matter of time before Krid would run out of ammunition and fuel."In a last effort to save his ship, Krid sent his Pinak into a steep dive towards a rocky planet.His ship fell so close to the surface that his men saw the shadow of their Pinak flitting across the crafters just below them and mountains flashed by beside them.The Tonns kept a safe distance from the surface, so they began to fall behind.The planets gravity catapulted Krids ship ahead of the Tonns.Right before going into the shadow of the planets dark side, Krid ordered his crew to dump out the rest of their ammunition.A huge fireball erupted in the twilight of the planets surface, making it look like his ship had crashed.Krids ship slipped into the night side, then turned abruptly and followed the length of the long narrow shadow of the planet as they sped away from the sun and the Tonns."The Tonns split up.Some searched the explosion site while others waited for Krid to come out into the light on the other side of the planet.The debris from the explosion and Krids high speed maneuver had fooled them."Later, when the Jaka fleet came to attack the supply base, the Tonns had already gone, but ever after they would say that capturing Krid Zaff was like trying to hold an angry bee in your pocket.Not many captains can take on six Tonn ships and live to tell the tale."***Calvin sat in the kitchen, looking at his boots.He had brought his cowboy boots from South Dakota and hadnt worn them except for the first day when they had launched the Shark from his farm.He held his dog Baker in his lap.Baker was whining softly as Calvin petted him.He looked his boots over again and tried to figure out how he could eat them.If only he could boil the leather somehow to soften it up.After a few moments, he began to feel very light headed, and he decided to head to his bunk to take a nap before he started cooking.He saw Frank sleeping soundly in another bunk before he floated into his.After a while, Calvin woke up slowly when he was jostled around in his bunk.His head hurt and he wasnt thinking too clearly.He slid the panel to his bunk open and stepped outside.His mind kept telling him that something strange was going on.It finally dawned on him when he stepped on a sharp object that he was walking on the floor without magnetic boots.The ship was vibrating and there were sporadic lurches in the floor as he made his way toward the cockpit.He headed up the ladder to the cockpit and wondered at how hard it was to heave himself up by the rungs.It was strange to feel the pull of gravity again.He poked his head through the hatch into the airlock and looked through the open door into the cockpit.Gavin and Cliff were seated in chairs, and outside the windows there was a brilliant pink and orange glow.Gavin was giving commands into his headset, but Calvin couldnt hear them over the noise of the engines.He climbed into the cockpit and sat in one of the chairs to watch.After a few moments, Gavin got out of his chair to lean closer to the windows.The orange glow had faded and the ship was vibrating much less.Cliff looked out the windows on his side.After a few quick commands, Calvin felt a lurch, and then the ship was suddenly quiet and still.They must have landed.Gavin and Cliff kept giving commands to the men to switch settings on the engines and a host of other details.Calvin was so tired and hungry that he just leaned back and rested his head on the control panel on his right.He was reluctant to hope that they had found a planet with food on it, for fear of having his hopes dashed.He shut his eyes to wait and rest in the stillness as Gavin and Cliff went about their work.He heard movement in the airlock and looked back to see Mabok typing commands in the airlock controls.Mabok stared in awe at what he saw in a readout on the small screen in the airlock.He was still for a few moments, and then he closed his eyes with a smile and gave out a big sigh."Eighty two percent nitrogen, eighteen percent oxygen!"Mabok said to Gavin and Cliff."Wonderful!"Gavin exclaimed, "We can breathe it!""The pressure is a little lower outside," Mabok said as he gripped the hatch lever in his hand and looked at Gavin."Should I?"he asked, motioning to the hatch.Cliff nodded and headed over closer to the airlock.Mabok gave the lever a pull and the hatch popped open with a loud hiss that lasted for half a minute.Calvin felt wind flow past him as air escaped out of the hatch, and then the hiss died down.Mabok heaved the hatch all the way open until it clanged on the top of the hull, and then he climbed out.Bright sunlight came through the open hatch into the airlock.Calvin felt a hot breeze coming through the hatch and smelled the clean, fresh air.Gavin and Cliff climbed out of the hatch also, and Calvin rested in his chair for a few moments until he mustered the strength to get up and take a look.After so long in cold space with little light or heat, Calvin basked in the warm glare of a sun that filled his whole body with warmth.He looked over the hull of the Shark towards the horizon.Heat waves boiled off the skin of the Shark and made the air shimmer.Soon he was sweating.He climbed down the rungs on the side of the Shark and stepped on the ground with a smile.It had been so long since he had stood on the ground, and he relished the feeling.He leaned down to run the dirt between his fingers, and got a sharp thorn in his index finger.He had never been so glad to get a thorn in his finger before, because a thorn had to be made by...a plant!This planet had life!Calvin looked around at the dark green plants spread out into the distance on the dry dirt floor of the planet.Gavin and the others were gathered around some of the plants.The plants all looked like they had been baked in the sun far too long.The big ones were about eight feet tall and very wide.Sparse, scraggly branches spread out in every direction.The plants had tiny, dark green leaves that had a thin, layer of shiny fur and seemed to have a waxy coating on them.The branches often had thorns and would leave a black, sooty mark if you brushed up against them.Calvin looked around for any fruits, but he could see none on the plant.He scanned the horizon again and took in the reddish brown hills and peaks in the distance.The baked peaks looked like they had been ancient volcanoes that were beaten down through the years.The hills all had the same bushes, but there were also some spiny looking plants scattered among them.Maybe those plants had fruits."Calvin," Cliff called to him."Yeah?""Bottle up some water and bring it back out here!Were heading over to those hills!"Calvin climbed up the rungs to the top hatch.
