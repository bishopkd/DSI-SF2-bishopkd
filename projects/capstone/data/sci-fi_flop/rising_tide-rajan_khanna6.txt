Passcode, a voice says.Shit.Someones down there.But friend?Or enemy?I grab the microphone.Tamoanchan, this is Ben Gold and Miranda Mehra.We dont have a passcode.Were just returning to the island.We came to see if you were okay.After a brief pause, the voice, male, comes back.Ben Gold?Yes.Another pause.It seems like they recognize the name, but because I spent time on Tamoanchan, or because I fucked with a bunch of Gastown raiders?You know the eastern landing ground?the voice asks, after a moment.Yes, I say.Proceed there.Someone will meet you.I look at Miranda.What do you think?We both look out at the island.There are a few bright spots that are probably airships low down the way that Tamoanchan used to keep them, but they could be anyones ships.I think we have to go, Miranda says, resigned.Me, too.So I bring the Dumah around to the eastern landing ground.Keeping the ships down low means that they cant be spotted easily from the sky.They have a hydrogen operation, several, actually, that help refill the ships and let them lift off if grounded.I see the usual assortment of ships, but have they just been captured?I try to see the Osprey, Diego and Rosies ship, but I dont.Which doesnt necessarily mean anythingthere are several places they stash ships.On the Dumahs belly cameras I can see a small crew near a securing station, a place where theyve made it easy to anchor.I try to make out what theyre wearing.Valhalla raiders favor furs and leathers.As good as the cameras are, I cant seem to get that level of detail.I drop our anchor, and the crew helps secure it.I lower the Dumah closer to the ground, then send Miranda to drop the ladder.Before we leave the hatch, we face each other.I wish youd kept the gun I gave you, I say.I still have the dart gun, she says.A pistol that shoots small tranquilizer darts.Its better than nothing.She straightens my jacket, presses lightly against the star still affixed to my coat.Lets go.I go first, figuring if they take a shot Id rather it get me than her.But none come.I lower myself to the ground, then approach the crew.The way the sun is coming down through the trees, its hard for me to make them out.My fingers itch for my revolver.I stay close to Miranda.Then I can make out the crew.Three people, two men and a woman.I think I recognize one of them from my time here before.From the original Tamoanchan.Part of me relaxes, unclenches.I suddenly realize that Im holding Mirandas hand.I give it a squeeze now that I am starting to realize that were among friends.Then one of the men pulls a gun on us, because of course he does.I have that kind of luck.They treat us better than Mal did (or at least better than Mal treated me; Miranda seems to have fared just fine).And much better than those Navy assholes.They take our weapons, but they put Miranda and me in the same placenot a cell, but something slightly cozier.But bare.There are guards outside.What do you think is going on?I ask.Miranda smiles.The usual Ben Gold charm.I laugh.We dont wait long.The door opens and four people walk in.I recognize one of them.Brana.Short blonde hair, hard face.Shes the leader of the Tamoanchan Council.She was the one who questioned us the first time we came to the city.With her is a man with Asian ancestry, a scar on the left side of his jaw.Looks almost like a burn.Theyre flanked by two Tamoanchan peacekeepers wearing their brown and green and carrying rifles.None of them are smiling.None of them look happy to see us.Brana shakes her head.I knew you would be trouble the first time you came here.I should feel apprehensive about all of this, but I dont.I feel calm, somehow.Relaxed.I think its partly because were here.Theyre here.Tamoanchan survived.You were the one who let us stay, I say.She nods.A mistake that Ill no doubt continue to pay for.You know, I say, I get the feeling youre not too happy with me right now.Should I be?Her face twists as if in disgust.She points a stiff arm at me, first finger extended.You were supposed to stay here.Instead you convince Diego to take you to Gastown, risking our location.Compromising our location.All for what?To get your ship back?I notice you didnt bring it with you.Did you find something better?Does anything really matter to you?You have no idea what youre talking about, Miranda says, moving forward.Theres a faint flush in her face, the kind that she gets when shes excited about some data, or when shes angry.Ben got his ship, and then he sacrificed it.We almost sacrificed our liveswe were ready toto save all of you.Branas still frowning, showing no reaction.Ben took out the raiders that were headed here.He was trying to do right by you.Im not surprised that Miranda has my back, but it still feels good.Branas tough, but Mirandas tougher.Brana crosses her arms.Yet our location is still compromised.In the hands of the worst possible people.Ben wasnt the one who told them, Miranda says, her voice low and steady.I grimace.It was Diego.But Im the one who put him in that position in the first place.Can we stop this?I ask.Miranda and I came back because we needed to make sure you were okay.And yes, I blew up my ship to stop the raiders from reaching you.I know you still think of us as outsiders, but we both want to be here.Im sorry that I got Diego involved in all of this, and Im sorry for what happened to him.I cant take any of that back.But I was hoping that I could help you.That I could fix this.Now.Brana raises an eyebrow.How?We were on Gastown.We have some idea about what youre up against.About what were all up against.I just want to figure out a way to keep Tamoanchan safe.And Miranda, well ...Ill let her talk about that.Miranda crosses her arms over her chest.First I want to know who this is.She gestures to Branas companion.Im Lewis, he says.Hes the leader of the minority party on the Council, Brana says.I realize that I dont have the slightest idea of how the Tamoanchan Council works.I suppose I shouldnt be surprised that they have different parties, but I just assumed Brana was fully in charge.I put out my hand.Im Ben, and this is Miranda.Lewis takes my hand, tentatively, and says, I know.I suppose my reputation precedes me.He flashes me an amused smile.You could say that.You said you have something, Brana says impatiently.I have data, Miranda says.Data I took from Gastown.It should help advance our research immeasurably.Meaning what, exactly?Lewis asks.Its the first time hes shown interest in any of this.Meaning that were closer to a cure, Miranda says.But perhaps even closer to what Ben promised you when we first came here.A detection system for the virus.The mans eyes widen.Brana shakes her head.Look, I say.Were here.You have us.Why not just sit down and put it all on the table.Talk this through.Then you can decide what you want to do with us.Brana seems to mull it over in her mind.The man looks at her, then back at me.I think an exchange of information is warranted.I nod at Lewis.Then maybe we can start by talking about what happened here?When we left Gastown, Rosie had Diego on board the Osprey and they were headed straight here.Miranda and I flew to try to intercept the raiders and succeeded.With a little luck and a lot of foolishness, we managed to take them all out.What does that mean?Lewis asks.There were five ships.Three were carrying live Ferals.Its a tactic they used back when they attacked Gastown.They drop the Ferals in ahead of their attacklet the panic set in, and then come in afterward to mop up.So what did you do?Lewis asks.My lips curl up in a grim smile.I flew my ship right in the middle of them and blew her up.Made quite a pretty light show.How did you survive?Brana asks.We jumped out of the ship in a raft, Miranda says.We fell into the water.Lewis looks at me like Im crazy.Fair enough.I shrug.Thats ...hard to believe, he says.Youre telling me, I say.So what happened here while we were doing the impossible?Lewis leans back in his chair.Rosie and Diego made it back and raised the alarm, so we started an evacuation.So you were off of the island before the attack came?I ask.Thats just it, Lewis says.There was never any attack.What?We evacuated and had a few ships come back to check on the island, and no other ships came.None?Lewis shakes his head.That doesnt make sense, I say.Maybe, Miranda says.When you found Diego, you said it seemed like he had just told his interrogator about Tamoanchan.Maybe a small group left Gastown right away without being able to assemble a larger group.Maybe we got all of them.I remember what Tess told me the first time I visited her.I did hear that with the disruption down at the plant, they had sent a number of ships there.That might have prevented them from sending a larger force.But surely they would have recorded the location.Maybe, Miranda said.Could they really have lost the location?Or could they really not care?We need more information, I say.Brana nods, then shakes her head.Of course.And youre the one to find it, right?Leave the island again?I dont think so.Someone should.Things are starting to come together in my mind, but Im not ready to bring them up yet.So they didnt come here.Thats good.How is Diego?Brana looks at her boots.Hes recovering.His wounds were substantial, but none of them life threatening.His sisters been caring for him.Good, I say.Rosie would defend him to the death.Of course, Im probably not her favorite person right now, but Ill still need to see him.What happened after you fell into the water?Brana asks.How did you get out?Ill tell you, I say.But can we sit down at least?Its been a long couple of weeks.So we all sit like civilized people.Except that their side has two armed guards on it and, judging by the way theyre standing, theyve been given orders to shoot if necessary.Miranda is next to me, close by.Lewis and Brana are opposite us, but with adequate space between the two of them.I tell them both the whole story, going back to what happened after I left Tamoanchan.How I went to Gastown with Miranda, Rosie, and Diego.How we met Claudia there.How Rosie and I went with Claudia down to the helium plant to check it out.How we found evidence of Gastown scientists experimenting with Ferals.Miranda fills them in on what she and Diego got up to back on the floating city.Then together we take them through leaving Gastown, taking out the raiders, and then an abbreviated version of what happened with Mal, the naval base, and escaping.By the end, Lewis is looking at us incredulously.All of that happened in the past few weeks?Just about, I say.I left out a few things.Quarantine is painfulthree days of confinement and restricted rationsbut in the end they let us back into Tamoanchan.Its late afternoon as we walk up to Diego and Rosies house.Its a simple, wooden dwelling.Theyve taken the time to paint it in a light color thats not quite white but not quite anything else.Their door, however, is green.I realize that the houses colors are pretty close to the Ospreys colors, their airship, and I raise my appreciation.What are you smiling at?Miranda asks, and I remember what were here for and chase the smile from my face.Diego.The last time I saw him, his face resembled ripe fruit more than it resembled a face.His dark brown skin had been covered in cuts and bruises, one eye swollen shut, his face stained with his own blood.I didnt see the torture, but I could see its marks.They had broken him.A more steadfast man I couldnt imagine.And they broke him.Im sometimes afraid to think of how.Are you going to knock?Miranda asks.I want to.I need to.But I hesitate.This is all my fault.Just do it, Ben, Miranda says.And so I do.I reach out and knock on the door.It opens a moment later.Rosie appears in the doorway.Shes taller than Miranda, though not as tall as memuscular, hard.Her long, dark hair is pulled back in a ponytail and she wears a worn baseball cap on top of it.Whatever logo or symbol it might have sported has long been worn away.When she sees us, her eyes widen at first, then narrow.As she looks at me, her face twists into a disgusted frown.Hello, Rosie, I say.Shes silent for a long moment.Her expression doesnt move.She just stares at me.Then.You have a lot of nerve coming here.I wanted to see Diego.She closes her eyes for a moment, tilts her head to the side.Then a wide smile crests her face, a humorless smile, and she opens her eyes and shakes her head.After what you did to him.Rosie, Miranda says.Diego made his own choices.And Ben got him out.Rosies face goes hard.He wouldnt have been there if not for you, she says in a low, cold voice.I know, I say.And if I could go back and change that, I would.If I could take his place, I would.Fuck you, she says.Just...Can I see him for a moment?Rosie continues to shake her head, then turns toward the door, one arm on its edge.Hes still not healed, she says.I nod.I dont know why.I just dont know what else to do.And based on the last time I saw him, of course hes not healed.Those bastards took him apart.The visible scars will probably be the least of his worries.I think then that shes not going to let us in to see him.That shell keep me out because she blames me for what happened to him, and I dont blame her for blaming me.Rosie, Miranda says, Ben did all he could to save you.All of you.He was ready to sacrifice his life for that.So was Miranda, I say.Rosie looks up at me.Her face doesnt soften, not even the least bit, but her eyes narrow as if shes searching me.Then a voice comes from behind her.Let them in, Rose.Diegos voice, deep and warm and rumbly.Rosie looks back at him.Cmon, Rose, he says.I want to see them.Rosie steps back from the door and pulls it back with her, gesturing in with her hand.I step inside, Miranda right behind me.Diego is standing behind her, where the light from outside dims.Hes wearing a wool cap, and beneath it his face is healing.There are scabs and bruises on his dark skin, but the knitting has begun.He still looks like shit, though.Diego, I say.I hold out my hand to shake, but Diego grabs it and pulls me in, slapping a large hand on my back.Thank you, he says.For getting me out.Thats not ...you dont need to thank me, I say.He pulls back and looks me in the eyes.No, I do.He smiles at me, but I think I see something behind it.Pain?Or something else?Miranda steps forward and hugs Diego.Shes all but swallowed up in his bulk.Im so glad youre okay, she says.Likewise, he says.Back on Gastown, while Rosie and I had infiltrated the helium plant, Diego and Miranda had investigated together.At the time it had driven me crazyMiranda would barely talk to mebut now Im glad for it.Of course while they seem to have bonded because of their time together, Rosie hates my guts.I dont think your sister is a fan, I say to Diego.Diego sighs and waves a hand.Shell get over it.Shes just protective of her big brother.How are you doing?Miranda asks.Mending, Diego says.The pain gets a little less every day.The bones are knitting back together.I wince at that.You look better, I say.Diego shifts uncomfortably.There are some good doctors here, he says.He nods, perhaps a bit too emphatically.They took very good care of me.He looks up at me.Did I really look that bad?I get that same image of his face, swollen and beaten and broken.You werent at your best, I say.Though better than a Ferals ass.His smile fades to stone seriousness.If you hadnt gotten me out ...I dont know if ...I couldnt have lasted much longer.Now its my turn to shift uncomfortably.I shake my head.Lets just say were even.His face widens in surprise and he immediately winces.Even?he asks.For getting me to Gastown so I could get my ship.He thinks about this for a moment.Nods.How is she?he asks.It shocks me for a moment, his question, and I quickly look away.She didnt make it, I say, not knowing what else to say.As soon as its out, I regret it.Diego is starting at me, wide eyed.Then he starts shaking his head again and again.Then all of that...Ben gave up the Cherub, Miranda says.He sacrificed it to stop the raiders headed here.He almost sacrificed his life.So did Miranda, I repeat.I can feel Diegos eyes sharply on me, but Im looking at Miranda.You almost died?For Tamoanchan?I feel heat flush my face, and I suddenly want to be somewhere else.I didnt really think it through, I say.It happened so fast.Diego starts nodding.Then thank you again.I nod back.But the urge to run for the door remains.You know what?Diego says.I think this calls for a drink.Absolutely, I say, the urge to run suddenly forgotten.Then, Can you drink?We dont have a lot of fancy painkillers, he says.So I pretty much have to.Rosie brings in a bottle and some smudged glasses.Shes not looking at me.Even if Diego seems okay with me, she is definitely not.I flash back to something she said to me a little while ago when we were looking for the Cherub.She knew what to look for.She told me the first time we had met that she had been looking for ways to take the Cherub down.If it became necessary.It gave me a shiver then and it gives me one now.The liquor is brown, like whiskey.But it doesnt look like something from the Clean.What is this?Something one of our locals makes, Diego says.He picks up his glass and turns it around, looking at the liquid inside.He distills his own alcohol and even has some old oak barrels he found or bartered for.He ages it in those.He raises his glass to me and Miranda.We follow suit.To the Cherub.I toast, then take a sip.Its strong, almost creamy.Slightly sweet.There are definitely flavors I cant identify.Impressive, I say.He nods.Miranda raises her glass.To Tamoanchan.We all take a drink.Then it seems like its my turn.I raise my glass.Look at Rosie, then Diego, then Miranda.To ending the Sick, I say.It surprises me, but I realize that I mean it.Not just the Bug, not just Mirandas cure, but Valhalla, the raiders, Gastown, the death and destructionall of it.Miranda catches my eye, a strange expression on her face, then we all take a drink.Mine is long and deep.I wipe my mouth with the back of my gloved hand.Were all silent for a moment.Then Diego says, So whats next for you two?I take another sip of this pretty amazing whiskey and then I shrug.The Council isnt too happy with me right now.They even confiscated the ship we took from Mal.Mal?Oh, right.I fill him in on everything that happened since we left him at Gastown, finishing with our days in quarantine after Brana and Lewis left.Miranda chimes in when I get to the information that we got from Tess.My friends are out there.She shakes her head.Possibly being tortured.Certainly being mistreated.I need to get them back.Can you put in a word with the Council?I ask Diego.Diego looks at his drink and shakes his head.The Council...One large, brown hand curls into a fist.Gastown screwed me.Oh.He raises his head and meets my eyes.Im lucky Im not in a cell right now.I think its only because there wasnt an invasion that Im not.As it is, theyve cut me out.He takes a drink of his whiskey.Finishes the glass and refills it.They let me stay here, but I might as well be a prisoner for all theyll let me do.I hear Rosie make a noise, a growl or something, deep in her throat and she turns and walks out of the room.So were all in the same boat, Miranda says.Grounded, I say.We all reach for our drinks.Do you both have a place to stay?Diego asks.Im trying to head out to see Sergei and Clay, Miranda says, but they said I wouldnt be able to get a ship until tomorrow because of the patrols theyre still running.I shake my head.Then you should stay here, with us.Diego, Rosie says from the next room.We have the room, he says.Its simple, but...That would be great, I say.I look to Miranda.She nods.Thank you, she says.Diego, Rosie repeats.Can I talk to you?Diego gives me a look as if to say, Im in for it, then stands up and leaves the room.I notice that the effort pains him, though he does his best to act as if it doesnt.We can hear their low voices in the next room, but I find I dont want to hear what theyre saying.I know most of it.Rosie doesnt want us here.For a moment I think about telling him well find another place.But we have no other real friends here.No barter.And I want Miranda to feel safe for a night.Rosies voice raises and I hear the words all that happened and a few moments later, ruined your reputation.I throw back the rest of my drink and only then realize that Mirandas way ahead of mealready halfway through her second glass.As usual.This is going well, I say.Shell get over it, Ben, Miranda says.Maybe she shouldnt, I say.Shell get over it, Miranda repeats.I nod, but I dont know that I believe it.A few moments later, Diego returns to the room and leans against the doorway.You can stay, he says.Im sorry, we dont have a spare bed.We barely have beds ourselves, but we have some blankets we can lay down in front of the stove.Youll have to share.I look at Miranda and raise my eyebrows.She says to Diego, That will be fine.Thank you.Good, he says.Then were all set.He settles back into his chair and reaches for his glass.Whos ready for more?Me, I say, perhaps a little too eagerly.I slide my glass forward.Diego fills it.The three of us toast again wordlessly.Rosie doesnt join us.The blankets smell very clean, and we lay them on the floor in front of the stove.The stove is an interesting contraption, made of iron that was probably resmelted somewhere along the way.It burns wood, and a pipe carries the smoke outside.The island gets chilly at night, but the area around the stove is nice and warm.I shed my jacket, then my shirt and pants until Im in my underclothes.It feels strange to be so uncovered around other people.I feel vulnerable.But I also realize that for a little while Ive stopped thinking about the Bug and being infected.I know that Miranda and I havent been together the whole time but, and it goes against everything Ive known and felt my entire life, Im not worried about her infecting me.Its against all my instincts, but then they seem ridiculous right now.So I slip under the blankets, and they feel warm and soft against my skin.Miranda likewise strips down to her underwear, a simple pair of underpants and a bra.Theyre from the Clean, I see.The elastic is loose and puckered, the color faded to a gray, but shes obviously kept them clean and taken care of them.I feel myself go hard at the sight of her so unclothed.Its not something I see very often.Ferals dont count.She slides under the blankets next to me and that hardness gets, well, harder.I didnt think my body could be hotter, but the temperature under my skin ratchets up another few hundred degrees.I can feel Mirandas presence next to me.Its like shes pulsing, giving off waves of force.I dont look at her.My mouth is dry, my teeth gritted together.I can smell the soft, homey scent of the blankets and my own sweat and Mirandas scent, the smell of her skin, and theres this maddening fuzziness in my head.My cheeks flush.Ben, she says, and moves closer to me, leaning into my body.My arm goes around her and pulls her close, and that heat, that fuzz, intensifies.I feel like a metal cable vibrating, thrumming, at her touch.Miranda, I say, and turn toward her.Her smell is all in my nostrils, her body against mine.I am almost blind and deaf and dumb.Some kind of wave rises in me, and as if we have no choice at all, my mouth moves forward, and hers does too, and we find each other, and our warmth mixes together.I dont know how I can be hard and liquid at the same time.My thoughts disappear.Skin against skin.Lips on lips.What remains of our clothes slid and pushed away by fingers and toes and friction, glorious friction.I lose myself.The world comes together in brief momentsa glimpse of her light brown skin, the hardness of a nipple under my fingers, then my tongue, her hand on my cock.But each moment is washed away by this intense feeling, this physical euphoria that rises from my center, up my chest, and into my neck and extremities.Miranda climbs on top of me, and we move together, and I gasp and the whole world disappears and just ...pleasure.Pleasure.Bliss.Ecstasy.And need.Building need.Were breathing hard and gasping and biting and kissing and sliding down this slope, and I feel it building and building and building and then, in a moment of startling clarity, I lift Miranda off of me as I come and my whole body shudders with her in my arms, and we lay, panting against each other, sweaty and, slightly later, serene.For a short while, I lay there, trying to take all of this in.Trying to hold on to this small, perfect island of contentment in a dark and dangerous sea.Then, when I feel like I have it, I roll Miranda over and move down her body, my head ending up between her legs.A different kind of intimacy as I move my tongue, exploring Mirandas body, tasting her, feeling her move and hearing her gasps and moans.I listen for her sounds and respond to her movements, and she gets louder and fasterthen her legs grip my head and she lets out a last strangled sound and then relaxes.I crawl back up to her, and we fall asleep against one another.As I slip into that sleep, I think, Were going to have to wash Diegos blankets.THIRTEEN FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA Ben and I had sex last night.Its something thats been building for months, the physical tension, I mean, and I can say that it didnt disappoint.Ben was ...Ben was passionate, and unrestrained in a way that surprised me.He can be so careful, so controllingwhat comes from a life focused on survivalbut I felt that he was just there with me, in the moment, and the world, the world he fears, stopped existing for a brief, glorious moment.Only ...its more complicated than that.Of course sex is sex, and it doesnt always have to be something significant, but in this case theres a lot happening beneath the surface, a lot of emotions and feelings and ...theyre complicated.I have to admit that I still havent quite gotten over what Malik told me about their past.Im sure Ben could explain it in a way that would make sense to meand I know that he was a different person back thenbut he left someone behind.Someone he possibly considered a friend.And that chills me.And though I tell myself that hes a different man now, that he was willing to sacrifice not just his ship but his life for Tamoanchan, I cant seem to forget that.Its related, I have to guess, to the prison camp.To the idea of leaving people behind.And knowing that a group of my people, people I have worked beside as we try to figure out Maenad, are sitting in a prison camp run by our enemies.Who knows what they might be facing?Torture?Starvation?Executions?I cant stop thinking about it.It kept me awake.After Ben had fallen asleep, I lay in his arms for a time.But I couldnt sleep.I fell in and out.Like I was back on the ocean, in the raft, constantly juggled by the sea.So when I heard Diego stirring, and saw him go outside, I followed him into the predawn air.He looked like he was having a harder time sleeping than I was.He had circles under his eyes and a hollow, haunted look on his face.Nightmares?I asked.He nodded, and one hand massaged the back of his neck.Its like when I relax, suddenly Im back there.Gastown.He looked at me, his face so sad.I see them ...theyre hovering over me.He clenched his fists and turned away.They have knives and clubs and...He paused, a choking sound coming from his throat.Sometimes they just have their fists.And Im trapped.He looked back at me, his eyes wide.Not just in the dream.Im there, lying in bed, and I cant move.I cant...I walked up to him and put an arm around him.Im sorry, Diego.Im sure it will pass.In time.Thats what I said, but as soon as it came out, I realized how tepid it sounded.I have no idea of what hes going through.And while my specialty is biology, I know how much psychology can affect it.Its fine, he said, pulling away from me.His face settled into a stony mask.I wanted to reach out to him, tell him it would be okay, but I was already feeling like a fraud.This was a disease I knew very little about.What are you doing up?he asked, shifting the focus on me.I hesitated.He had his own problems, but ...I dont know.I told myself he might enjoy the distraction of someone elses problems.But maybe I was just being selfish?I needed to talk to someone and he had offered?So I told him about what was haunting me.I need to get my people back, I said.And as soon as I can.He nodded, enthusiastically.I wonder if he could relate to them being imprisoned there.Tell me about Lewis, I said.What about him?What are he and his party trying to accomplish?Diego shrugged.Hes been leader of the minority party for a few years now.Hes tried a few times to put his party on top, but Brana and her folks have been too popular.People here are scared, about our vulnerability, but they want to forget about that.To have a life.Branas hard line gives them the sense that they can.So why was Lewis there to meet us the other day?I get the sense that he is trying for one last push.With the raiders and ...what happened on Gastown.He shrugs.He must sense Branas vulnerability.I just dont know if he can do anything about it.Maybe he just needs a little help, I said.What do you mean?He searched my face, suddenly suspicious.I had to remind myself that this was his home.His people.And here I was trying to manipulate it for my own needs.Maybe Ben had rubbed off on me too much.I shrugged.Brana hasnt been a friend to us.She only reluctantly let us set up on the small island.She hates Ben.Shes been awful to you.Diegos face was impassive.Maybe we appeal to Lewis instead.Diego started pacing.I got the feeling I was making him uncomfortable.Can you set up a meeting for me?Diego narrowed his eyes.Im not on the inside anymore.He shook his head.They dont listen to me like they used to.I walked up to him.Damn it, Im ashamed of it, but I walked up to him and I put my hand on his shoulder, reaching up to him.Please, I said.You must still have contacts.Can you reach out to him?He looked down at me, meeting my eyes.The sun was just coming up and I remember him seeming enormous.And steadfast.And I remember thinking that he was meant for another world.An older world.I think so.Then do it, I said.He didnt ask me why or to explain, which I was grateful for.I was tired of talking.I needed to do something.Instead I just leaned up against him and together we watched the sun rise.Diego set up the meeting at a place called the Frothy Brew.I recalled Ben talking about it in the past.I think maybe raving about it is more accurate.He always got a little ridiculous when it came to beer.Me, Id prefer another whiskey or Maliks wine, but I ordered a light ale and chose a table.Lewis found me soon afterward, settling into a chair opposite me, a dark ale in hand.Diego said you wanted to talk.He sipped at his beer like it was a practiced motion.I was hoping you could help me, I said.He didnt respond.Instead he took a long draught of his ale.There are some scientist friends of mine, former colleagues, and theyre being held in a prison camp run by people out of Gastown.Im sorry, Lewis said.So am I, I said, meeting his eyes.Which is why I want to get them out.Lewis steepled his hands together, drew them close to his mouth, the fingertips touching his lips.Then he said, I dont think thats going to be possible.A hot, fiery anger kindled in the pit of my stomach.I capped it, but I still felt it pushing through.I get it, I said.Theyre nothing to you, except maybe a risk.But ...what if they could offer you something?Lewis flagged down a server for another drink and said, What do you mean?I mean that Im one of three people working right now on studying the virus.Imagine if there were three times as many.Go on...You know what a jigsaw puzzle is?I asked.He nodded.Imagine the picture of the Maenad virus is like a jigsaw puzzle.And like most jigsaw puzzles any of us have seen, its missing a lot of pieces.The pieces we have give us a fraction of the picture, but theres still so many missing that we cant get the whole thing.Okay.The data I took from Gastown helps fill in more of the pieces.Only there are only three of us to see how they fit together.If I could get more people, if we could all work on filling in the puzzle, we could definitely make some progress.He pushed his empty cup away and leaned in.Tell me exactly what you mean.There was my opportunity.To lay it out.To make my case.I inhaled, held it for a moment, then exhaled.Based on the data, and some calculations Ive made, I think I can make a virus detection kit.He frowned.How would that work?It would be a simple blood test, I said.Wed need specialized equipment, of course, but once we do that, once we can identify the virus, it should be an easy thing to do it on a regular basis.Lewis pulled his cup back to him and curled his hands around it.How long would it take?The blood test?I shrugged.Maybe an hour at most?And this would be reliable?How would you make sure it works?We would do rigorous testing, of course.Testing on clean subjects as well as infected ones.Ferals.Yes.Alpha, our Feral test subject, would be ideal.But we would want to do field tests.On living Ferals.Yes, I said.Though anything along those lines would be done off of Tamoanchan, of course.Alpha is on a nearby island.We might test on the mainland as well.The waitress returned with another dark ale and set it down in front of Lewis.He sipped at it absentmindedly.As you can see, I said, it would eliminate the need for quarantine.At most you would need to hold people for the time it took to run the test.And that means a quicker turnaround for supply runs and, most importantly, safety.If someone did arrive infected, you could identify him almost immediately and take immediate action.Lewis nodded, then took a swig of his beer.Isnt this what you already agreed to do for Brana?Yes, I said, expecting that.Ben and I had made our bed with Brana on our previous visit, but it became clear on us returning that she wouldnt support us.So I reformulatedreformed the equation.Our agreement was that I would research along these lines.But thats not really important.Not in your world.Oh no?No.I dont care anything for politics; Ive never been interested in restarting civilization or analyzing the best forms in which to do so.But I know how to lead people.Anyone who works with scientists realizes that its maybe the hardest way to lead.I know that a group of people, all with genius level intellects, all wanting to head off in their own directions, is maybe the hardest group to corral.But thats what Ive been doing.And thats what I know.So I told him.It doesnt matter how the test works or whom I originally talked to about it.It matters who announces it.Who brings it to the people.If we do this, and I appear with you to talk about it, people will link this to you.This could be a big win for your side.Lewis leaned back, his face thoughtful.You need an edge over Brana, I said.Youre racing her, but you keep coming up behind.This can put you ahead.He tapped the rim of his cup.You have a choice, I continued.You can keep playing it safe or try for something bigger.Something grander.You want to lead your people, you dont do that with backroom deals and power plays.You get up in front of them and you spin them a vision of the future.You draw them a pictureTamoanchan, five years from now.A paradise.A city unlike any since before the outbreak .A city free of the virus.Free from fear of the virus.He stared at me, his eyes slightly glassy.And what is it that you need to make this happen?More hands, I said.Sergei, Clay, and I can do a lot, but I need people to help with the analysis.I need people to verify and duplicate my work.And I need people to question me.Well need to gather supplies.And well need to run tests.That will take time, but it will be quicker with more people.And these people need to be brought here.We need to be in the same place, I said.We work as a team.And theyre being held in a prison camp?he asked, sipping at his beer.I nodded.I dont know how many.But if we can get them out, and back here, then well not only be saving them, we may be saving everyone on Tamoanchan.So you need me to authorize the resources to get them.Think of it as an investment.In the future.He shook his head.What makes you think Id be able to back something like that?I have to operate within the Council, and Im telling you that Ill be voted down by Branas party.Theyll delay a vote until its a moot point.Youre an outsideryou dont know how the Council operates.Its not designed for efficiency.And theres no other option?Is there any way you can put her on the defensive?Have her party have to catch up?His cup paused halfway to his mouth, then he put it down on the table.I recognized that lookinspiration.There is an emergency order, he said.Whats that?He leaned forward, suddenly energized.Were allowed to authorize measures without getting Council approval if doing so is vital to the safety and security of Tamoanchan.Theyll likely fight me on that, but by the time they do, itll be too late.He slammed his hand down on the wooden table.It was just about then that I sympathized with Ben.Specifically how he convinced Diego to take him to Gastown.He wanted the Cherub so badly that he hammered at Diego until he acquiesced.I want my people back so badly that I did the same to Lewis.This is an enormous risk for me, Lewis said.So we have to set some parameters.Like what?Ill need something tangible.And soon.I nodded Youll get it.Ive been studying Maenad since I was a child.My mother and father studied it before me, and with the data that I recovered and my friends ...we can do this.Weve been waiting for a breakthrough like this.The other steps are in place.Now we can cross the gaps.He chewed on this for a little while.Ill need to assume full oversight of your research.What does that mean?I asked.It means that for my help and my risk, I will conduct periodic visits for progress and safety.It means that ultimately you report to me.If I do this, your project becomes my project, and I intend to make sure it comes to fruition.That was the hardest pill to swallow, to be honest.Im used to running my own projects.I knew Id need to enlist someone else, but to give up control ...that didnt, no, that doesnt sit well with me.Who was Lewis, anyway?Just a politician.With an agenda.I almost said no.But then I thought of my people, in a prison camp.Trapped, tortured, and abandoned.This could be my only shot to help them.To bring them back home.I cant have you interfering in my work, I said.My work, Lewis said.If we do this, its my work.For my friends, I thought.It isnt about meits about them.And all the people we might help.You stay out of the science, I said.He shrugged.Thats not really my thing.Youre in charge when it comes to that.Everything else, though, goes through me.I leaned back.I thought about how I used to have all my people together, and a safe place to study.I thought about how long I had been in charge.Then I thought about how it all had come crashing down, so quickly.I remembered the lives that were lost in the process.I looked Lewis in the eyes.Okay.I agree.Lewis nodded slowly.He drummed his fingers across the table top.I do, too.Thank God, I thought.Then lets get to planning, I said.FOURTEEN They put the Dumah at the western edge of the island where theyve set up yet another airfield.Its smart thinking.With the risk of attack still looming, theyre setting up multiple places to get ships off the ground.Multiple areas for evacuation.Multiple targets for enemy ships.Shes a strange looking ship, I think, as we approach, now that I can see her up close in daylight.Shes not like anything Ive seen before.Flatter than most ships, and with that matte coating to the envelope.But she looks sleek.Not as sleek as the Cherub, but sleek nonetheless.Shes being topped up as we approach, the hoses feeding her hydrogen to get her ballonets nice and plump.Guards stop us before we get to the airfield proper.We have orders to keep him out, a grey and grizzled man says, indicating me.My reputation has traveled, I say.Lewis waves a hand.Ive canceled them, he says.He holds up a piece of paper.Can you read?The guard shakes his head.Then youre going to have to take my word.You know who I am.I have a signed declaration here from the Council.An order saying this ship is to be released at once and given over to this man.The guard doesnt look happy, but he takes the paper.He cant read the writing, but he obviously recognizes the seal thats on the paper.And he steps aside.Which is a relief but makes me wonder how easy it would be to stage a coup on Tamoanchan.I know that Lewis is taking a risk, but hes taking it for his own benefit.Im also aware of how this whole thing could blow up in our faces.Lewis turns to me.You sure you know what youre doing?Thats funny, I say.I was going to ask you the same thing.Lewis turns to look at my copilot.Diego still looks beat up, but hes here.And I still dont know if thats a good thing or a bad one.It was his idea.As we were laying out the plan, three things became apparent(1) the Dumah made a great dirigible to use, as she could get close without being seen and we could use her cameras to help spy out what was going on, but (2) she didnt have enough cargo capacity or space in the gondola to take on the number of people we were talking about.So that meant another ship.A passenger or freight one.Diego immediately suggested the Osprey.But (3) I needed a copilot.I couldnt run everything myself on the Dumah.Of course Lewiss plan meant that we couldnt really appropriate any ship captains or ships from the islandthat could be made to look like they were weakening the islands defensesso that left me and Diego, seeing as hed been relieved of his duties.Miranda of course wanted to come with me, but Lewis crushed that idea.I need you here working on the virus, he said.Getting things ready for the others if Ben is successful.That if seemed to make her flinch.I knew she was angry, but the fact was I had to agree with Lewis.Her place was on the island, working on her cure.It wasnt that I didnt want her with meof course I didbut she was most valuable doing what she did best.And I could get along better in a fight without having to worry about her.Still, things feel strange with her.We spent the last night in front of the stove again, but things were different.We kissed and touched but ...she felt distant.I hope that shes just worried about the boffins.As we lay there, next to one another, shoulder to shoulder, Miranda asked me, Ben, why didnt you ever tell me your middle name?I sighed.I was hoping you would forget that.You know me better than that.She looked at me, all concern for a moment.Its not ...Cherub, is it?I gave her my most wounded expression.Its still too soon for those kinds of comments.She placed a hand over her heart.I am terribly sorry.So ...middle name?I shrug.I never ...the way my father told it is that my mother picked it.Miranda was silent.I rarely talked about my mother.She chose it.And I didnt really have anything left from her.So ...I guess I grew up thinking it was something special.And secret.Unconsciously I reached up to my chest, where I used to wear my dads Star of David.That star was gone, but Id gotten a replacement, the one currently pinned to my coat.I suppose you want to know what it is.No.No?I mean yes.I do.But not now.I looked at her, all questions.She placed a hand on the side of my face.Come back to me with all my people, and then you can tell me, okay?I nodded.Okay.Then I pulled her to me and held her in my arms until we both fell asleep.But I woke up alone again.Ben?I snap back to Lewis, only just realizing that I had been lost in my thoughts.Yeah.You ready?I nod.Lewis stares me down.Dont fuck this up.Ill get them back, I say.But not for you.Lewis turns to Diego as if appealing to him for help, but Diego just pulls me toward the Dumah.Thats the ship you stole?he asks.Sure is.Diego whistles.That old friend of yours must be out of his mind with anger.I smile.Yeah, I say, and I feel a twinge of something.More conflicted feelings.I know Mal was ready to kill me, but once more I had a part in that.Ben Gold, always fouling the water.Technically, Miranda stole it, I add.Oh, well thats all right then.We board the Dumah and I briefly show Diego the layout of the controls, covering both the flight controls and the controls that deal with the bank of monitors.Then I settle into the pilots seat and start up all the engines and rotors.A hum goes through the ship, and I feel a slight vibration.A purr, almost.Everything looks good, so I release the anchor and let us rise.Shes quiet, Diego says.Sure is, I say.Thats one of the reasons I wanted her.Diego lays out the set of maps we brought with us.Using the information from Tess, weve managed to trace our route east, though well need to check out the landmarks when we get to the right place.I push the engines to full, turning us back toward the mainland.Even with full power it will probably take us a few hours.Enough time to chat with Diego about why hes really there.You didnt need to come, I say.Yes I did.You said that you needed someone else to fly this thing.I know.But it didnt have to be you.You trying to prove something?No.He shakes his head and turns back to the monitors, examining the controls.I wanted to help.And I needed to do something.Ive been stuck in that house for too many days.I turn the chair to him and cross my arms.And this has nothing to do with you showing everyone that you can still do this?That Gastown didnt damage you that bad?His expression darkens and he sets his jaw.I realize I might be entering dangerous territory.He places both hands on the console.I think youre the one with something to prove, he says.What does that mean?Remember, Ben, Rosie and I were the ones who told you about the Gastown raiders coming for Mirandas people.I saw you light out of there, desperate to save your friends.Only you didnt.A wave, cold and angry, rises through me.I did what I could to fight the raiders.I was outnumbered and outgunned.Do you really think that?he asks.That you did everything you could?I become conscious of my heart beating hard in my chest, and I stand up from my chair.Are you trying to imply something?He meets my eyes, his face expressionless.Ben, I dont need to imply anything.Are you telling me you dont feel guilty about that?And of course as he brings it up, I do feel it resurface, that feeling that maybe I could have done more, could have tried more.The fear that maybe the old survival instinct got the better of me.And yet...I think you have me beat on the guilty feelings front, I say.What?
