"Don't you think we should change the porno broadcast to something more suitable for the occasion?"Jerry asked."Sound idea.There is a program here of the mental retardation of a longtime DnDrf sniffer whose chitin is about to go soft. ""No, I think not, not in a railroad station. ""Then how about this.A low type mind working on computations for betting on the daily jeddak races. ""That's more like it, sort of person who would work here, I imagine.Plug it in. "They entered an area of wide corridors and great stacks of boxes.Occasionally a flatbed cargo carrier would appear, driven by a Hagg Loos, but they were so noisy that they announced their arrival, and there was always time to hide.Soon after this they found one of the cargo carriers standing idle, and after a swift look at the controls, they climbed their machine aboard.With a twist of the handles they were off, moving much faster now, part of the busy workings and ignored by all the other workers they passed.Jerry was whistling happily when they spotted a high arched exit ahead with a patch of blue sky shining through."This looks like it," he told Slug Togath."Press the button, and let's get out of here. "They rumbled forward and were almost free of the station when the ugly form of a Hagg Loos popped out of an opening in the waIl.A very official looking monster with cop written all over it, from the golden shield nailed to its chitin in front to the ugly looking weapon it clutched, and even to the fiat claws on its feet.As the thing trundled in their direction, Jerry flipped a switch that allowed thoughts to enter but not leave."You jeddak racing fan moron," the thought arrived,  "what do you think you are doing driving out of the station with that load of bombs?Can't you read?Now let me see your ID, and get away from those controls before I let you have it. "It was disaster.14  BIRTH OF THE GALAXY RANGERS!Really a disaster for the cop.Jerry was ready at the gun controls, and he swiveled the tail about and pressed the right button, and from the poison sting the supersonic crumbler beam lashed out.The hapless minion of the law instantly crumbled into a heap of white chitin dust, and the cargo carrier rumbled on.But the alarm was out!Sirens warbled and alarms clanged while the guards converged from all directions."We had better leave the cargo carrier here," SlugTogath shouted, busy at the controls."Not just leave it  make them a real present of it!"Jerry yodeled, spinning the wheel that sent the clumsy machine crashing into the doorway.Great motors hummed in the legs of their robot Hagg Loos machine as it jumped clear just in time.At full power they sprinted away from the station and the growing excitement at the jammed exit, and just before they turned the corner, Jerry sighted carefully and put a quick zap of the heat ray into the load of bombs.They blew up nicely indeed, shaking the ground with a mighty thunder and bringing down half the station behind them.Chortling, they fled, strolled rather, so they would not be noticed.Inside the strolling machine Slug Togath unfolded a map of Haggis City that the spy had sent them and guided them swiftly toward the secret lair of the spy, X 9."Careful now," Jerry cozened, "we are getting close. ""I can read a map just as well as you can," Slug Togath grumbled."That's nice," Jerry mused."Say, do you notice that that manhole lid  the one over there about twelve feet in diameter  is sort of lifted up, and I think I can see two glowing eyes watching us from under it. ""The police!"Slug Togath wailed, and his tentacles stumbled over the controls so that their robot danced a little two step on the pavement."Easy does it there, old squid head," Jerry consoled."Don't get carried away until we find out what it is.Might just be the sewer men at work, you know. "From a loudspeaker on the wall came an impatient hissing."The manhole is also hissing," Jerry observed."And it may just be hissing for attention.Let's sidle over in that direction. "Attempting to look innocent, the twenty foot long machine disguised as a great white scorpion foxtrotted sideways until it was close to the manhole.The glowing eyes followed them, and when they were close a hoarse voice whispered, "One, two, three, four, five.... ""The password!"Slug Togath shouted, then switched on an external loudspeaker."Six, seven, eight, nine, ten," he said into it."What kind of cockamamie password is that?"Jerry asked, aggrieved."A five year old could figure that one out. ""It's what they call native psychology. "The manhole lifted higher, and a white claw beckoned them forward.After a quick look around to make sure they weren't being watched, the machine shot forward and down the giant manhole."The Hagg Loos have such short tempers that they can't count past four without getting so irritated they stop.In this manner do we know that the great beast lurking here is none other than the Hagg Inder spy who goes by the name of X 9. ""Hiya, X 9," Jerry said into the microphone."You took your own sweet time about getting here," X 9 grumbled."I been lurking in this damn sewer so long that I'm covered with fungus. ""Hazard of the game," Jerry said offhandedly, ignoring the other's bitter tongue."We came as soon as we could after you stopped answering the radio on the secret wavelength.What happened?""They caught me cracking into the secret laboratory and became suspicious.I talked them out of it for a while; after all, I am head of intelligence on this filthy planet.But I couldn't convince the Lortonoi of my innocence, they were too shrewd for that, and when they wanted to subject me to their infamous mind vacuum technique, I fled and have been hiding out here ever since waiting for you. ""But you know the location of the secret laboratory!"Slug Togath exulted."That I do. ""Would someone let me in onto what's going on?"Jerry muttered petulantly."Chuckee hungry," a new voice said as Chuck woke up with a wide yawn."Here is what has happened since you were sold into slavery," Slug Togath explained, counting off the different points on his tentacle tips."First, experiments showed that the new cheddite was far stronger than the original piece, perhaps owing to the presence of certain gastric acids of your female companion.More experiments are planned to determine validity of this, although female companion presents great resistance to sample takers.Suffice for the moment that not only has the cheddite projector been aligned to project the Pleasantville Eagle, within which it is installed, to a precise and distant spot, but it can take with the Eagle at least one hundred other ships. ""Chuckee thirstee," the almost brainless hulk muttered and struggled against the strap that held it to the chair.Jerry gave it a couple of inches of straight rye in a glass which soothed it somewhat."So the massive attack is planned and ready," SlugTogath continued, "but could not begin until the precise location of secret laboratory was known.Since the first attack must blast straight to the lab and stop any attempt to escape with the cheddite projector there, nothing could be done until that information was obtained.Which, if you will pardon my saying so, X 9, is the purpose of our presence here and if you have the coordinates for the secret laboratory they would be greatly appreciated. ""83556.98 by 23976.23," the master spy instantly replied.Slug Togath wasted no time.He flipped the switches that hurled power into the ultlra radio with the secret wavelength and, with a certain smugness in his voice said,  "Slug Togath reporting from Hagg Loos.The coordinates of the secret laboratory are 83556.98 by 2396.23.Do you read me?"They read him all right, for the results of his message were dramatic to say the least.The instant he had stopped speaking the sky above became black with Hagg Inder battle cruisers, one hundred of them, instantly transported there across the gulf of space by the power of the cheddite projector.As soon as they had appeared, they roared into action, each hurtling toward an assigned target so that a moment later great explosions rocked the ground as ravening death hurled down from the wide open projectors and guns of the fleet.Crackling bolts of electrical destruction tore at the national armory, the spaceport, the liquid lead works, the factories, the sewage plant, everything for they showed no mercy.The very air crackled with the discharge of the mighty energies, and the solid earth beneath their claws trembled at its magnitude.Cautiously they lifted the manhole cover and peered out at the rain of destruction.But as they did so, some force grabbed onto X 9 and the robot Hagg Loos and plucked them up into the air.Jerry and Slug Togath both rushed to the weapons, but even as they touched the triggers, they saw the source of this strange force and relinquished their grips on the weapons.For they were being pulled straight up to the Pleasantville Eagle, which circled and swooped above.At the last moment, before they were crushed against the dural, the force lessened and drew them on, softly as a falling rising feather, to rest against the underside of the wing.They could see John waving from the pilot's compartment as his voice crackled on the radio."Welcome back, gang.As you can see, we were ready to go as soon as we got your message.We jumped here, and an automatic tracer zeroed in on your radio broadcast, and the new magnet beams, developed in the laboratories of the Hagg Inder under the tutelage of the eons old wisdom of the Garnishee, whisked you up.Now, so you don't think I'm just flying in circles and beating my gums, you will notice that below, as we talked, the gunner on the cheddite projector has been peeling back layer after layer of that immense fortress, hurling the layers into the sun of course, to expose the laboratory.Ahh, I believe that is it. ""It is indeed!"X 9 agreed, hurling the thought at them, since he had been telepathically following the conversation."Sic 'em!"Jerry jubilated as the flying fortress of the 747 dived like a hawk into the ruins.A light touch on the wheel, aided by a quick projection from the cheddite projector landed them right in the middle of the lab among the fleeing Hagg Loos, a good number of whom were squashed by the wheels as they dropped.Even as the wheels hit the combat doors (newly installed) dropped open, and from the cargo compartments roared weapon wielding Hagg Inder warriors, while from the cabin, no less roaring or weapon wielding, came the Garnishee fighting men.Carnage was instantly spread among the benches.The ravening Hagg Loos asked no quarter, nor would they grant it, fighting back with anything that came to hand, benches, crystal retorts, bars of metal, urinalysis samples; they were utterly fearless.But fearless, they died under the assault of the allies, who swept all before them."Would you kindly get us unstuck from this wing?"Jerry said, not too graciously as they thrashed impotently under the attraction of the magnet ray."Sorry about that," John apologized, cutting the power.They dropped to the floor, and as they fell, Jerry saw a sight that made his blood run cold."Over there!"he bellowed into the microphone hooked to the external speakers."Two of the crustacean swine are escaping with the cheddite projector.Stop them at all costs!"Even as he spoke, the robot machine was hurling its mass across the room, plowing through any Hagg Loos foolish enough to offer resistance.There were two of the enemy scientists carrying the machine, and one fell instantly to a lightning bolt from the forward gun.But the other, protected by the bulk of his fallen companion, dived for a secret door, pushing through it and closing it behind him.Jerry, in close pursuit, could not stop in time, and the machine plowed into the door with a horrible metallic clanging, then short circuited.Electricity arced through the metal shell, and the occupants screamed sharply and leaped up as this same electricity raced through their metal chairs making a fundamental difference.An instant later the fighting warriors were there, dragging the disabled machine aside, battering down the door and rushing through the opening, led by the bellowing Lord Prrsi, who was shouting mighty oaths and war cries."There the blighter goes  tally ho!"and the hunt streamed on.But the moment's respite at the door had been enough for the fleeing Hagg Loos scientist.He hurled himself and his precious burden into a monorail car that vanished into a tunnel mouth followed closely by bullets and blasts of energy."In a car heading due north," Lord Prssi reported."Pursuit impossible since this is the only car. ""North," Jerry mused as he struggled out of the ruined machine, and with Chuck following on the end of a string, Slug Togath behind, he bounded athletically and hurriedly across the ruined laboratory and into the cool embrace of the Pleasantville Eagle."North, that sounds familiar.Do you have a tracer on the cheddite?"he asked, sweat bursting from every pore."What has happened to Chuck!"Sally screamed, wringing her hands before the empty eyed husk that had once been the man who loved her with every fiber of his being."Got him," John said, fingers rushing over the cheddite tracer controls."Heading north at a great rate. ""Into the air and follow!I have a funny feeling that I know what is going on. ""Chuckee hungry," the husk muttered, and, through bloodshot, gummy eyes, it made out the round female form hand wringing before him.All those bumps meant something, the elusive memory was there  yes, it had it!"Chuckee hungry!"the husk bellowed and leaped, tearing Sally's clothes from her until she stood before them, naked except for the black wisp of her Maidenform bra and even wispier black panties."Enough of that, Chuck thing," Jerry sighed and karated it into unconsciousness once more, then hopped around the room on one leg, sucking at his swollen karate hand which he had forgotten about.Sally vanished, screaming weakly, and they turned back to the more important business at hand."Due north," John said grimly."I have a sneaking suspicion. ""So do I," Jerry agreed."And isn't that an extinct volcano just coming into view?""The old ploy with the volcano and the spaceship," John laughed coldly."But we have them this time.The instant it rockets into the air you get it with the cheddite projector, and zingo!end of the fiendish race of Lortonoi. ""You're on  and here it comes!"Jerry jammed his face against the viewfinder as smoke billowed from the mountain and a great spaceship hurled itself into view.He focused with a quick turn on the controls and jammed down on the firing button.The Lortonoi ship vanished."You did it!"John shouted, slapping his comrade on the back with delight."One blast, and there he went.What a shot!"Jerry smiled sheepishly and covered his face with one hand and peered out between his fingers."Well, thanks, but you see, it didn't happen quite that way.It seems that the spacer vanished a millisecond before I pressed the button.Meaning.... ""Don't elaborate, I get the message. ""Meaning that they have mastered the use of the cheddite projector and have fled with it, to wreak even further havoc through the civilized galaxy.But they'll not get away with it," he swore."I have a tracer on them, and they are hopping with ten light year jumps out that way, toward that cluster of stars.We'll fuel up and take off after them; we have no choice. ""And I will help," swore Slug Togath, who had entered,  "and my Garnishee warriors will follow as well. ""Not to mention the fact, chums, that we are ever so grateful on Hagg Inder," came the beamed thought of Lord Prrsi."Least we can do is pitch in and lend a hand, only civilized thing to do, you know. ""That's it!"Jerry exulted, smashing his fist into his palm and wincing."That's it!Don't you see what that means?For the very first time in the eons old history of the universe the civilized, intelligent races are banding together against evil, to combat it wherever it is found.A band of brothers, fighting together, dedicated to the pursuit of liberty, equality, and fraternity. ""I wouldn't exactly phrase it that way," Lord Prrsi commented."I would rather say we are fighting for the maintenance of the class system and the continuancy of special privileges for the few. ""Call it what you want," Jerry shouted, "it is still democracy.Our gallant little band will go forth, fighting against any odds, pushing out the frontiers of liberty.We chosen, noble few will stand forth alone, just as the Texas Ranger did on the frontier of our land many years ago. ""You've said it, man," John broke in."That's the word Rangers.Rangers of space, combating evil wherever we find it. ""The Galaxy Rangers," Slug Togath said in a hushed voice."Where does an alien go to enlist?"15  THEY SPEAK OF KRAKAR  The great royal hall of the Hagg Inder was gay with bunting, colorful with noble decorations, slippery underfoot with the perspiration of the humanoid races who found that, even with the air conditioning turned full on, what proved to be a cold chill for the Hagg Inder was a scorching furnace for them.But no one cared!Today was an important day, so important that it would go down in galactic history forever.Today the Galaxy Rangers officially came into being.The future Rangers thronged the floor, looking up at the dais where the king himself would pin on the first star of the first Ranger, number one, the lucky creature who would be commandant of the most powerful force for democracy that the lenticular galaxy had ever seen.There had been a small difference of opinion on who the commandant would be.Since the Pleasantville Eagle and the cheddite projector, the backbone of the force for the Rangers, belonged to the four Earthlings, it had been decided that one of them would fill the top post.Sally was a simple girl, and Chuck was out of the running as well, his brain still no more active than a squashed watermelon despite the efforts of the finest Hagg Inder brain men, so the choice naturally fell upon the remaining two.Jerry felt that since he had invented the cheddite projector, he should be number one, but it was pointed out to him that the guy who invented the Monitor had not been admiral of the Union Navy, so he grumbled into silence.As far as the other races could tell, the Earthlings were identical in abilities, and either would suit.In the end, a deadlock set in, with equal feelings  or lack of feelings  for both Jerry and John.Since the king was throwing out the first ball, the decision was left to him, and he chose John without an instant's thought."Discrimination," Jerry muttered to Sally where they sat sweating in the audience."Just because he's black and they're black, they pick him without an instant's thought. ""But, Jerry, darling," she reasoned, "isn't it always like that?After all, on our tree shaded, Midwest, bible belt, WASP campus wasn't John the only black and he was the janitor?"He darted a suspicious look sideways out of narrowed brooding eyes."What are you, a Commie or something?""Shhh  the king is about to speak. "A rustle of eager interest ran through the great hall on silent cat's feet and was replaced by a hushed siilence as the king clattered slowly forward."Hagg Inder, Earthlings, Garnishee, strange looking creatures of many races.My mate and I wish to announce, upon this auspicious occasion, the founding of the soonto be historical, instantly galaxy famous organization by the name of.... "He blinked his faceted eyes at a metallic sheet on the stand before him."An organization by the name of the Galaxy Rangers. "Instant pandemonium filled the great hall as cheer after cheer split the red hot air.It took a long time for the enthusiasm to die down, and the king could only be heard after portions of the floor under the noisiest spectators had been electrified."With this bold band of brothers formed, the next need is for a gallant leader to lead these gallant warriors and, after careful democratic selection"  a single angry snort was ignored  "the Earthling John was nominated unanimously for this signal honor, and it is my privilege to present him with badge number one of the Galaxy Rangers. "There were more cheers as John stepped forward and the king pinned the golden star upon his chest.John screamed hoarsely as the king ran three inches of pointed steel wire in John's pectoral muscle since, in the heat of the moment, he had forgotten that aliens pinned the pin to their clothing instead of drilling a hole in the chitin for attaching these kind of things.With shaking fingers John finished pinning on the golden star with the large number 1 upon it, the words "Galaxy Rangers" picked out neatly in diamonds, and turned to the microphone, blood seeping a ruddy patch into his clean white shirt."Fellow Rangers, I greet you.I am going personally to pin Ranger star number two upon my old friend, Jerry Courteney, and after that it is your turn.Don't fight as you rush forward; there are stars enough for all.What an opportunity this is!Travel, education, career, the job of your choice, free medical and dental attention, and that can mean a lot  like, for instance, that alien there with more teeth than a piano keyboard, he'll really make out.This is the opportunity of a lifetime.We are here creatures of many different races; I count among the escaped prisoners from the DnDrf mines at least forty different species and who knows how many offspring from mixed marriages, all eager to join up.As further inducement to enlist, I mention the fact that we have no transport to take you back to your home worlds, and as soon as we Galaxy Rangers take off, the Hagg Inder turn off the air conditioning and, zowie, it's two hundred and fifty degrees again.But don't let me attempt to pressure you in my enthusiasm.Let your conscience be your guide.And form a single line to the right, and anyone who doesn't want to come can just stay here and sweat it out.For, ha ha, a long time. "To a man, or really to an alien, they volunteered, and the Galaxy Rangers were already making a mark in history.But all was not happiness.Later, after the exhausting ceremonies, the Earthlings were sitting in the first class lounge of the Pleasantville Eagle, having cocktails and chopped Ormoloo liver and facing one inescapable fact."He's got about as much intelligence as a damp kitchen mop," Jerry said, nodding to his old buddy Chuck, who sat on the floor chewing happily on a shoelace and mumbling to himself."Could the Hagg Inder physicians do nothing?"Sally implored.John shook his head in an unhappy no."They did their best, their top people, super mind readers and all that.Too far gone, they say, for their meager talents. ""And their meager talents are the best in the galaxy," Jerry brooded."So I guess we ought to start thinking about euthanasia next, as soon as we are sure about his will. ""You cannot!"gasped Sally."Why not!If he's going to sit around and drool like that for maybe fifty years more, he is not much good to anyone, including himself. ""You are so cruel!""I am not.I'll bet you that Chuck would want it that way.I certainly would if it came to the choice. ""I say, not interrupting anything am I?"Lord Prrsi asked, poking one great faceted eye into the room."Nothing important," Sally snapped "Just murder and such. ""Well, yes, indeed.Then I'll just slip in and curl in the corner and turn my heater on high.Yes, thank you, I would appreciate one, very tasty. "He smacked loudly as he drained a gallon of dry martini at a gulp."I've come here rather unofficially, so to speak, and would appreciate it if what I tell you stayed inside these four walls.Or would it be six if you counted ceiling and floor?""Prrsi, old sting tail," Jerry said, "we are not in the mood to discuss state secrets at the present time, I hope you'll understand.We are discussing the fate of our incapacitated comrade Chuck. ""Well, so am I, old fruit.But what I propose is highly illegal and dangerous. ""What is it?"the three friends asked, leaning forward as one."Well now.Hear me out, I beg, before interrupting.The tale I have to tell may sound strange, but I heartily assure you, it is true, though a well kept secret.Far to the south of here just beyond Averno Desert are a range of sharp hills that the local peasants call the Mountains of Madness.Many people who venture into them are never heard of again.Many years ago the then king sent an expedition into the hills, armed, tough minded Hagg Inder, utterly fearless, sneering at alien or beast.They were gone for months, all track lost.Finally, a single survivor, chitin scratched and filthy, crawled into a village just beyond the mountains.He would not speak of what had occurred, and the peasants were not that interested in hearing the details in any case.But he was brought here and spoke with the king and the nobles, and since that time we in the royal house know about it but don't say a word. ""About what?"Jerry asked, completely confused."Didn't I ask you not to interrupt?"Lord Prrsi said peevishly, lashing his poison barb back and forth and rattling his claws on the walls.They were silent."Well, to go on, if you don't mind.The secret has been kept ever since.In those mountains, in a certain valley, lives one of our race, an ancient of uncountable years.He lives in a cave by himself, a hermit mystic who does not wish to be disturbed as he thinks his centuries old thoughts.If anyone comes close, he blasts their mind with a mind blast of such intensity that it cannot be averted.Now, as you know, our race has great mental powers, second only to the foul Lortonoi, and even against them we can hold our own.This will give you some idea of the mental strength of the hermit.Word of the mind blasting is common in the area, so of course, few venture that way.But before he died, the sole survivor told us that the hermit does not blast minds just like that.He asks the potential mind blastee three questions or riddles, and if they are answered, why, then the prisoner goes free. ""What has that got to do with us?"asked Sally."I don't want my mind blasted. ""Goodness, no one would want to blast your sweet little mind, Earthling female.If I might continue.Now it seems that one of the party had been struck on the head by a fallen boulder and his chitin crushed in and his brains pretty well mashed to boot.He was being taken back for medical treatment, although all there agreed that his case was hopeless.But it wasn't!The hermit, with the incredible strength of his thoughts, restored the hapless victim to normality before asking the questions.His brain was so good he even got two of them right, though he muffed the third and had his restored brain instantly blasted. ""I see," Jerry mused."But it's a long chance. ""It's the only chance," John said.The silence stretched as the two men looked each other in the eye; then it stretched some more."Well, I'll go if you won't," Sally said, springing to her feet."Can you get me a map, Prrsi?""Ahh, you are indeed a stout brick, little Earthling chum.But, hope you won't mind my saying it, it will take a far sturdier mind than yours to stand up to that of the hermit.It will need a mind of at least seven hundred and forty three IQ, a genius, a person of great moral fiber and strength, a natural born leader, one healthily oversexed. ""That's me," John and Jerry said, with one voice, standing at attention, volunteering, not realizing how well they had been conned by the cool brain of the red hot alien.Before they really realized what they had become involved in, they were in heatproof suits, stuffing the protesting Chuck into one as well, waving good bye to Sally and rushing out of the city in a great tractor treaded vehicle with Lord Prrsi at the wheel."We didn't bring much in the way of supplies," Jerry grumbled."Either way, this trip won't take long," Lord Prrsi said breezily."Gee, thanks," John muttered, and they settled down to a day and a night of uncomfortable boredom.The powerful machine tore across the desert, the untiring Prrsi at the controls, sending up an immense cloud of dust from its treads.When night fell, glaring headlights of piercing actinic light speared through the darkness and their pace never slowed.At noon, on the second day, they raced toward a range of mountains that had been growing steadily before them, and Lord Prrsi braked to a squealing stop at the mouth of a narrow canyon."I don't imagine you chaps can feel them, with your rudimentary powers, but I have been fighting mental waves of great intensity for the last couple of hours, attempting to turn me away.Instead, I have followed them to their source, this canyon.I am afraid I must let you out here, for I dare not go on.Take your hopelessly incapacitated friend and proceed.I wish you the best of luck. ""An atomic pistol would be a lot more help," Jerry said ingratiatingly."Weapons are forbidden in the valley.To possess them means instant death, I will wait for you here.Farewell,"  Step by hesitant step, the brave Earthmen climbed up through the crumbling scree, leading the Chuck thing at the end of a leash, It was hard going, and they had to stop to rest many times and suck at the nipples of the water tanks inside their helmets.They neither saw nor heard anything out of the ordinary, though both were possessed by a feeling of immense dread.A wave of depression against which they had to push physically.But they pushed because they were that kind of men, now having to carry the screeching, brainless Chuck forcefully.Finally, before a sharp turn in the narrow valley, there came a mental blast that almost seared out their synapses, a mental command that said but one thing."STOP!"They stopped, frozen, unable to move, even Chuck paralyzed by the intensity of the command.Then a voice spoke to them, or rather a mental voice spoke within their own minds, and they heard it louder than they had ever heard any sound with their ears."LEAVE HERE WHILE YOU ARE STILL ALIVE!""We have come this far, we will not turn back," Jerry said staunchly."And would you mind turning the volume down?"When the voice spoke to them again, it was still loud, but bearable."You know that there is no return from this valley of death unless the Test is passed?And few pass it,"  "We know that, but we have come for our friend's sake.If we pass the test, we sort of hoped "  "No bargains!I will decide what is to be done.Come forward. "Their feet almost did not obey them as they shuffled forward against the mounting wave of mental dread that filled the valley.Around the turn they staggered and stopped, without willing it, below a shelf that lay just in front of the black opening of a cave.They knew it was in that cave, even if the skulls and skeletons scattered on the ground before it were not a dead giveaway."I am called Baksheesh, and all who have come here have feared me!""Well, here are three more, Mr.Baksheesh," Jerry gasped, knees trembling despite everything he did, chilled and shivering despite the 240 degree temperature outside their suits."Are you prepared for the question?""We are. "John shivered in response."Then you are first.You have ten seconds to answer the following.... ""Hey, you didn't mention any time limit before this. "A cold chuckle was his only answer."Prepare now.We play this game by my rules since it is my game.Ready.What is black and deadly and sits in a tree?"John tightened his forehead in concentration as the seconds ticked away, gleefully counted off by the murderous Baksheesh.Jerry leaned over and tried to whisper, but a blast of mental energy blew up a boulder next to him."None of that or the mind blast blasts right now. ""Sorry, I didn't know coaching was against the rules. ""It is now.Seven ...eight ...nine.... ""I have it!A crow with a machine gun. "A wave of miffed mental radiation swept over them and was instantly gone."Think you're so smart!"the mental voice muttered."So let's see how well your buddy does on the next one.Five seconds on this one.And miss one question and you all die. "Jerry steeled himself, tightening his muscles and thinking healthy thoughts to clean his brain."Ready when you are, Baksheesh," he said.And back came the mental blast with the question."What looks like a box, smells like a lox  and flies?Five...four.... "It was counting faster now."Three ...two... ""A flying lox box!"Jerry shouted defiantly, and the muttering wave of mental anger in reply told him that he was right."That's two out of three, but it's anyone's ball game yet.I'm going to ask your drooling friend there the next question.... ""But you can't!He's not human.His mind has been chopped up by the vile Lortonoi. ""Hmmm, yes, so it has.And a sloppy job too, just like them.Here, I'll lift this mental block, erase that pattern, pour another in here, tap this subconscious memory and drain it into the right lobe.There, he's as good as new, maybe better.Now my question.... ""Hold on," John called out."We don't know if you have really fixed his brain; you may just be saying that.We'll have to talk to him first. "His words were cut off by a bone chilling cackle of shrill laughter."My rules, remember?Now, Chuck thing, you have one second to answer the following question.Ready now, think.What is the square of the product of 456.
