I know that smell, he told me, though he obviously couldnt remember what it was.Maybe something took up refuge in it?A squirrel or a bird or something?Jimmy never bothered to answer, just took out some tools hed hidden under the tree with his disguise.I realized my time was up, Id served my usefulness and could go.I dont know whether hed bothered with breakfast or not, but the following morning Jimmy was gone before I was awake.I knew hed confessed all to Delilah cuz I heard their argument in the night: that familiar story of her threatening to leave him if he was going to fill her world with junk yet again.I went down to see him but he didnt say much, only that the construction of the satellite was so outdated, he didnt even have the right tools to work on it.I stayed for a little while, watching him try to improvise, getting that obsessed look about him.When it became apparent he wasnt going to say any more, that any suggestions I might have wouldnt be welcome, I left him to it.I mean, as pleased as I was to see him burning with a little passion again, I really couldnt see the pointit wasnt as if the laser was still intact and we could build some kind of cannon or something.All he really had was an oversized squashed tin can with a few odd wires and broken circuits inside, which I wouldnt have thought much use to anyone.Mind you, we werent talking about anyone, we were talking about Jimmy.I was helping Delilah again, this time by taking the garbage out, which meant walking it up the street a ways and maybe throwing it on a fire, rather than have it stack up and create suspicion.As I headed back I saw Gigi coming out of the smoke from the opposite direction.I thought shed probably come to see Gordie.The rivalry between her and Hanna for our little matinee idol was now pretty much out in the open.Not that I understood itIdve thought Gigi far too cool and Hanna altogether too serene and sensible.But there you go: love makes fools of us all.Plainly we were in for another day of fighting over who was going to do what for the invalid, and as is the way of these things, the more they tried to please him, the less he appeared to appreciate it.In fact, I had an idea the little shit was beginning to really enjoy himself.As it turned out, Gigi hadnt only come to see Gordie, she also had something for me.She paused as we entered the churchyard and handed me a note.It was only folded in two, but I almost tore it, how fast I straightened it out.My love, Things are starting to change in here.I dont feel as safe as I did.I think somethings going to happen.No matter what, I want you to know that you made me happier than anyone has a right to be.I will love you forever.Lena  I read it through twice, the kick in my stomach even harder the second time.Whats going on?I asked Gigi.She shrugged in that way she and Gordie have, like shes indicating indifference, but actually shes about to give you bad news.She tried to escape...A Special got hurt.Is she okay?Yeah, yeah.Shes fine.I started envisaging it in my mind and my impotence erupted into anger.Shit!It wasnt the first time, Gigi added.More like the fifth or sixth.It was funny, no matter how concerned I was, I still couldnt help but feel that bit proud.Really?The night you tried to get in there.She tried to escape?She knew it was youshe made it to an outside door, but they caught her and dragged her back.I tell ya, that almost reduced me to tears: the thought that while Id been trying to get to her, shed been trying to get to me, that wed been that close.Can you get a message to her?Not anymore, Gigi admitted after a moment.They got her drugged and secured to the bed.Orders of the bitch.Nora Jagger?There must be a God, she said grimly, cuz sure as hell, shes the devil.I cursed several times, kicking at some nearby rubble.Not only was I making no progress, with every day the task was becoming that much more difficult.Gigi started to walk toward the shelter, expecting me to follow, but I spun around and headed back to the street.I couldnt go in there: sitting around and talking, going over it yet againwhat was the damn point?Catch you later, I called.Gigi looked a little surprised, but I was gone before she could reply.For some reason that had upset me as much as anything.Itd never occurred to me that Lena might try to escape.In fact, shed probably be that bit angry with meof course shed try to escape!That was her all over, the way she was...but now they had her secured to the bed, attending only to her basic needs, like she was some queen bee.It was more habit than anything that sent me in the direction of Infinity, but somewhere along the line I acknowledged that there was no point, that Id seen all there was to see.I continued walking, though, so lost in my frustration I didnt give a thought as to where, on and on until eventually I found myself at the ocean, not far from where we came ashore the night we escaped.I went down the beach and sat on the sand, gazing out across the murky sea to a point where the smoke and water merged to form nothing.I couldnt actually see the Island; for all intents and purposes it no longer existed.That place had been the most oppressive hell I ever couldve imagined.The years I spent wanting to get off it, pretending it didnt matter, til in the end it didnt, cuz all hope had gone.I gazed up and down, despair lapping at me in the same way the waves were the sand.I hadnt noticed them when I first sat down, but now I saw there were a few zombie sick about: little groups who barely had the strength to sit upright, just like on the night of our escape.What was this illness, for Chrissake?Were we likely to get it?Did anyone recover?It looked a bit like a one way ticket.Okay, if they were lucky, they got replacement organs, but that was only a part of the storyccording to Gigi there was a list of other symptoms as long your arm that someone elses organs just couldnt cure.Really, I cant tell you what the thought process wasmaybe it had something to do with the Island and remembering that once Id thought there was no way we could ever beat that place.Or maybe it was an old head like mine just needing to be left ticking over for a while, to make sense of stuff in its own sweet time: the zombie sick, the fires, what happened at Dr.Simons, that damn enticer, and even the convoy of white trucks that turned up at Infinity most afternoons...Whatever it was that caused me to put everything together, to fit isolated facts into an understandable picture, it was like a flash of lightning picking me out on the beach.All my thoughts, conscious and otherwise, suddenly clicked into perfect alignment.Jesus!There it was: I had an idea!That night, when everyone was asleep, I slipped from my sleeping bag and made my way down the wall toward the fallen tree, keeping as quiet as I could.After Id left the beach, Id returned via Infinity, just to check I was right, that it was the same routine every afternoon.It was the final piece in a very complicated jigsaw.When I got back to the shelter I insisted on cooking, even though it was Delilahs turnwhich gave me the opportunity to pocket the knife wed picked up at the camping store.I also took some organi plasters and bandages, and rummaging through the garbage, found an appropriate screw top plastic container.I didnt go all the way down to Jimmys workshop, just far enough that if I did make any noise the others wouldnt hear me.There wasnt a lot of moonlight filtering down through the smoke, but enough for me to see what I was doing.Id scrubbed the knife spotless earlier, sterilizing it as best I could in boiling water, and now I placed it on a low branch along with the plastic container.Tugging my shirt up to my armpits, easing my pants down a little, exposing my bare skin to the cool of the night.Jesus, was I really going to do this?Pains a funny thing.You can never really appreciate how bad it is until youre actually suffering it.I guess cuz Nature wants you to learn, but then forgetotherwise youre just gonna live your life in fear.I placed the blade flat against my bare hip, feeling its shrill coldness, then took a deep breath, and another, all the while telling myself that if I thought about this for too long Id never go through with it.The problem was, it had to be precise.I couldnt just make a quick slash and leave it at that: it had to be deep enough that it looked authentic, but not so deep it would do me serious harm.I stood there for another agonizing moment, gripping the knife as tightly as I could, the blade poised over my flesh while every fiber of my body screamed at me not to do it.Jesus!Oh God!I managed to stifle it to some degree, but I still gave out a cry of pain, knowing I couldnt stop there, that I had to keep going: push the knife down, slide it through my flesh, cut a long, deep incision.Even before I gave it a proper look, I knew it wasnt long or deep enough, that Id have to do it again.Oh no, I kept moaning, no, no, no I stuck the knife in again, probing at the cut Id already made, digging deeper, slicing further, feeling my flesh tearing apart.It was probably the worst pain Ive ever knownpartly, I guess, cuz it was self inflicted.I raised my head and let out this long silent scream to the night, the agony pulsing through me in waves, yet finally managed to pull myself together enough to remember the plastic container and placed it under the wound to catch as much of my blood as I could.I stayed in that same contorted posture for a good fifteen minutes, letting the blood slowly drain down, surprised at how little there was.Finally, when I was sure there was no more, I pressed the two edges of the wound together and stuck a large organi plaster on it, instantly reigniting the pain and causing me to cry out once more.I felt faint, nauseous, as if a growler had chomped on my side, but I still managed to wrap the bandage around me, cover the plasters and after picking up the knife and container, returned to my sleeping bag.Not that I slept much, not with that pain, particularly when I tried turning over.Mind you, with what I was planning, I knew all too well that I had a whole lot worse to come.Into the Fire        NINETEEN It took a couple of uncomfortable days for the cut to start to heal, for the organi plasters to really get to work.If I made the wrong move and the others saw me wince in pain, I just told them my ass was still giving me the occasional twinge, which was a conversation I knew no one was gonna be that eager to pursue.I didnt see the point of making some grand announcement about what I was planning, not then anywaythere wasnt a lot they could contribute, and if I was really honest about it, I was also worried that theyd be so negative about the idea, Id lose all faith in it.One person I did need to talk to was Gigi.Shed made herself pretty clear on the subject, but I still wanted to ask her if there was any chance of a little inside assistance.And, of course, though it hardly needs saying, I also needed Jimmys helpI mean, didnt I always?I went down to his workshop to find him giving a rather bored looking Gordie and Hanna a lecture on the development of punishment satellites, pointing out various components and explaining what they once wouldve done.The moment they saw me, they seized the opportunity to escape.Where ya going?Jimmy called after them.Were in the middle of a game, Gordie called back.What about?he started to say, but they were already gone.Huh, he grunted.I could beat them both blindfolded.I smiled agreement, then hesitated for a moment, wondering how to go about this, fearing I was in for a difficult time.In fact, I got so damned irritated with the situation, I just lost all patience and dived in, telling him exactly why I was there and what I needed.Jimmy stared at me as if he couldnt believe what I was saying.Why?he said at last.It was a fair question, and if there was any chance of him helping me, I needed to answer it as best I could.I took a deep breath, propped myself against an accommodating branch and told him exactly what I had in mind.With each new revelation his mouth gaped ever wider until soon he was staring at me as if I was metamorphosing from human to alien.Jesus!he gasped when I finished.What?Youre not serious?Why not?Its suicide!Jimmy, I protested, youre the one said I had to think my way in there.Yeah, but...think on.The odd thing was, despite the fact that I could see he was genuinely shocked by my plan, I also sensed something else: that maybe, just maybe, somewhere amongst all that mumbled and jumbled disclosure, Id earned a little of his respect.Theres an awful lot of assumptions there, Big Guy, he said.I cant just leave her there.What if youre wrong?he asked.What about?He made this face, like he was spoiled for choice.Everything!Jimmy, listen, dont do this, I begged.Im scared enough as it is, I know its not the greatest plan in the world, but its all I got.Nowand I was ready to go down on my knees if I had tocan you do it?He gave me the old market traders shrug, and then, to my enormous relief, followed it up with the familiar long intake of breath, as if it was absolutely impossible, quite out of the question, but maybe Id picked the one person in the world who might be able to handle it.I could give it a shot, he said, plainly already running through the idea in his head.And maybe, you know, if you did get in there, I could try jamming things up a little from the outside.Just get me what I need, I told him.I can do the rest.He made this face like he wasnt so sure about that.Youre not gonna tell the others?Nope.Theyll wanna be involved.Nothing they can do.He grunted, like that was my first big mistake.Oh, Im sure we can think of something.Okay, so as plans go, this one was frothing at the mouth, and Jimmy was absolutely right, there were so many places it could go awry.Maybe I had the whole thing ass about face?I mean, Ive already told you, thinking is not my strength; Id been forced into it cuz no one elsed come up with anythingnot even Jimmy.Mr.Meltoni used to say, Know your place and things wont get complicated.The very last words he wanted to hear from any of his boys was, Boss, I been thinkinghed fire them on the spot.In fact, if hed caught me doing what I was about to, Idve been on my way out the door, too.Eventually, I did tell the otherswhat I had in mind was so damn dangerous I didnt think it was right to just slip away without saying a word.Or to put it another way, who knew if Id ever see them again?We had a long discussion, as I anticipated, a lotta stuff was said I couldve well done without, but in the end, no matter how great their doubts, they insisted on participating.Which was just as well, cuz Jimmy had come up with a few ideas, A little bit of frosting on the cake, as he insisted on calling it.He reckoned triggering the growlers was down to movement rather than pressure.That day I threw rocks over the fence it had just been single impactsit had taken Hannas footsteps to actually mobilize them.What we needed was to give an impression of movement, to have several people throwing rocks one after the other.Jimmy was convinced that would bring them out, and having growlers on the loose would not only be a distraction, but severely restrict the movement of the Specials.Which sounded kind of frightening but feasible.Meanwhile, he was gonna see what else he could do to cause a little extra chaos.It sounded great, but as far as I was concerned, kinda nibbling at the edges, trying to distract Infinity from what was really going on, which was me getting in there.The thing was, though, was I gonna get in there?And if I did, what state would I be in?I needed to talk to Gigiand soon.I went to the usual placesor what was left of themspraying message after message.This time I kept it really simple:  HELP!It was enough, shed know it was me, and sure enough, I woke the next morning to find her fast asleep in Arturos old sleeping bag again.Actually, it was quite disturbing that she could enter the shelter at night, bed down and make herself comfortable, and not one of us ever heard her.I always thought my old ears were still pretty well tuned to that kind of thing, but I guess I was wrong.It was a good job she didnt wish us any harm.Id kinda got used to the reactions when I told someone what I was planning on doing, but no one was more dismissive or more openly hostile to the idea than Gigi and it really threw me.She acted like it was personal, that my recklessness was infringing on her in some way.If it hadnt been for the others sticking up for me, I dont think shed even have discussed the subject.Delilah and Jimmy got a little short with her, telling her she could at least try to help, and when Gordie and Hanna formed an alliance in my defense, well, she was pretty much forced to change her mind.In the end she said shed speak to someone, find out what they thought and get back to me as soon as possible.That afternoon, despite having to drag him away from tinkering with the satellite, Jimmy and me went out to search for all the things hed need.We went down to the industrial area, finding a lot of places broken into and occupied, mainly by the zombie sick.I guess theyd gone there to search for something that might ease their condition and just never had the strength to leave.There were hundreds of them, all wailing and pawing at you as usual.Thank God we were able to just push them aside, that their weakness meant their attempts to trash the place hadnt amounted to much and everything Jimmy needed was still there.We bagged everything up, he gave me a heavy box to carry, and we were out of that place in less than fifteen minutes, waving to those who came to the door to moan and howl after us.I mean, it was a terrible thing, and I did feel sorry for them, but again it went through my head that if it was that contagiousand bearing in mind the amount of contact wed had with the sickwhy hadnt any of us caught it?Despite how much he knew it meant to me, how lucky we were to find everything on his list, on the way back to the churchyard it became obvious that Jimmys thoughts werent on the plan but elsewhere.You know, they say smell is the most nostalgic of the senses, he said as we paused for a few moments to take a rest.What?I asked, my thoughts as far away from his as his were mine.I smelled something on that satellite the first day we brought it back.Jimmy!I groaned, thinking we had more than enough to worry about.It might be relevant.Lets just deal with one thing at a time, huh?I told him, not unreasonably.Its cool.You got my full attention, he reassured me, then got that look about him that meant I had anything but.How longs it going to take you?I asked, trying to concentrate his mind.If I had the right tools, I could take it apart in a few hours.Not the satellite!This!I said, gesturing at the bags and box we were carrying.Oh...Dunno, he replied.I need to do a bit more research.Jimmy!I cried, frustrated by how casual he was being.You said it yourself: its gotta be one hundred and ten percent accurate.Theres no margin for error.Yeah, I said it myself, he repeated impatiently, cuz I know.I picked up the heavy box again, reminding myself it was fragile and that I shouldnt throw it at anyone, however aggravating they might be, then stomped on.I mean, I didnt like losing my temper with the little guy, especially not with the pressure we were under, but I hoped it might help him focus a little.But I shouldve known better.We were almost back to the churchyard and hed barely said a word the whole way when suddenly he turned to me as if rousing himself from a coma.Maybe its got something to do with the fuel?he said.Despite all my doubts, the fact that he kept reminding me he wasnt any kind of a chemist and never had been, Jimmy still came up with the goodsat least as far as I could tell without putting them to the test.As much as it pains me to say it yet again, the way he adapts and makes do, how resourceful he isthe guys invaluable, a genius by anyones descriptioncertainly his own.On the other hand, Gigi didnt bring anything like such good news.She hadnt been able to get a message to Lena and wasnt optimistic about any kind of inside help.In fact, she was so lukewarm about the whole thing, to be honest, I wasnt even sure shed tried.It slightly threw mesomewhere inside I felt an old rusty antenna give a slight twitch.It wasnt just that she was being dismissive, I had the feeling there was something else.Not that it made any difference; as soon as the time was right, I was going, come what may.The only problem wasand, shit, that was an ironyI had to wait for Infinity to make the first move.A couple of days passed with torturous slowness; the others not saying much and me kinda grateful for it.I was forced to take off the organi plasters cuz my wounds were healing too quickly: like everyone else, they had to bide their time.With everything else that was going on, I hadnt been paying too much attention to the kids.I was aware that Gordie and Hanna were spending more time togethernot that they seemed to enjoy it that much; they barely said a word to each otherand that more and more of the things they did involved the other.What I wasnt prepared for was Gordie asking me for advice.Id got into the habit of sitting out in the churchyard after dark and keeping an eye on things, gauging the Citys mood and waiting for my moment, and one night he came out to join me.He took a while to speak, and when he did, it was all about me and my plan.To listen to him, youd think Infinity were in for the hiding of their lives, that Id reduce that place to rubble, along with anyone who happened to be inside.It aint gonna be easy, I told him, noting someone running down the far side of the street and wondering if it meant anything.Youll pulverize em, he sneered.I guess it was his idea of a pep talk, but it was making me feel even more uncomfortable, as if my madness was contagious.For a while he went silent and I thought hed said all he wanted to, but he hadnt even started.Dyou like Hanna?he asked.course I do, I replied, now knowing where we were going with this.Shes special.He sat there for a moment, slowly nodding his head.What about Gigi?Yep, shes special, too.But in a different way.Again he nodded.Which one dyou like most?Gordie!I protested, I like them both.Huh, he said, like I was being a big fat disappointment to him.Which one dyou like most?I asked, cuz that was really the point.I dunno...Hannas nicer, but maybe Gigis more fun.I chuckled and he instantly scowled.Why you laughing?No old guy would have a problem with that dilemma.So whats the answer?he asked hopefully.Whoa!I cant decide for youno one can.Ohhh, he groaned in frustration.Anyways, you dont have to decide now, I told him, getting up.But whatever you do, you treat them both with respectdyou hear?He nodded, and as we walked back to the shelter I managed to put my arm around his shoulders without it getting shrugged off.Hey, maybe this being a father business wasnt gonna be as hard as I thought.Another couple of days ground slowly by.It was starting to drive me crazy, and to make matters worse, just as I feared, the others accidentally came out with stuff that made me wonder just how much faith they had in me and my plan.Delilah talked about how Lena wouldnt blame me if I couldnt get into Infinity; Hanna put her arms around me and started to cry, saying it was for no reason, but it didnt exactly put my mind at ease.In fact, Jimmy and his satellite became a bit of a haven from all their well intentioned comforting, and as soon as I got the idea that was where the conversation was going, I would head off down to see him, grateful for the fact that he almost always ignored me.The little guy was still utterly obsessed with that satellite in the way that only Jimmy could be: trying to make sense of the bit he had and constantly speculating on the bit he didnt.The only times we saw him were at meals and bedtime.Which was why, helping Delilah re bag the food where the rats had got in, I was surprised to see him bustling up toward us.Gordie and Hanna were playing games on the mini screen as usual, but he snatched it from them.Hey!Gordie protested.Whats going on?I asked.Jimmy didnt answer, just started punching in information, his fingers moving at astonishing speed for an old guy.Mind you, I was a little surprised at what he eventually came out with.I been peeing down there.Sorry?I been peeing down there!he repeated.Oh, I said.I mean, okay, it wasnt such a big deal; maybe I had dug the new latrines a little too far away.How could I be so stupid?Jimmy cried, returning his attention to the mini screen, and I glanced at the others, wondering if anyone was making any more sense of this than I was.Urine!Jimmy cried, as if it should mean something.Ammonia!I didnt say anything then but actually, it did remind me that Lena had said something similar.They really did put those things up there on the cheap, he added.Dyou understand any of this?Delilah asked, turning to me.Not a word.The satellites were solar powered, but they always had a backup, an alternative source of fuel, Jimmy told us.Dyou know what hydrazine is?All four of us looked from one to the other, but Jimmy didnt bother waiting for a reply.Had a lot of uses: first as a rocket fuel last century, during the Second World War, later for space exploration.Its highly toxic; caused a lot of problems.On more than one occasion, craft falling back to Earth had to be blown out of the sky rather than risk contamination.When all those other countries, tinpot and otherwise, joined in the arms race by building their own long range ballistic missiles, a lot of them used cheap hydrazine derivativesI mean, who cares if their missiles are polluting the atmosphere when their job is to cause as much damage as they can?Is that what the punishment satellites used?I asked.Something similar...This one, he said, gesturing toward his workshop, probably lost the majority of its solar power capacity at launch and had to switch over to alternative fuel almost immediately.Which is why it didnt catch fireor not for long.There was a pause and Gordie turned to Hanna, his expression about as interested as when Jimmy gave them that lecture about the satellites beforebut I knew there was more to come.Thing is, he continued, the way those satellites were put together, the systems they used, most of the backup wouldve slowly leaked out over the years.For several moments we sat there wishing hed just come out and say it and not tease it out of us as usual, hoping someone might put us out of our misery.I shouldve known who itd be.So those people on the beach, the ones we keep running intothe zombies, Hanna said.Theyre not sick, theyre poisoned?Jimmy made this face.Maybe.Oh my God!Delilah croaked.I dont know what they mixed that stuff with, but not only is it toxic as hell, its got some kind of aggressive binding agent, so instead of evaporating the way it should, it ends up bonding with everythingconcrete, stone, steel, everythingwhich is why this whole damn City is burning, and why the fires go on for so long and keep exploding.Again there was a pause as possibilities reared up before us like growlers outta the ground.Have we been poisoned?Gordie asked, suddenly looking a lot more attentive.Jimmy shrugged.Maybe.To some degree.But I reckon theres a kind of micro climate out on the Islandwe always got more extremes of weather, and the wind off the oceanhopefully that protected us from the worst of it.I never felt well over there, Delilah grumbled.She was right: illness had been a way of life.We used to blame the garbage, and probably most of it wasbut not all, apparently.Still my mind raced on, careering through this new information, trying to link it with the old: was that why they kidnapped Lena, cuz shed spent all those years underground, in a completely unpolluted environment?I guess that would make her pretty special, but for what purpose exactly?So the satellites werent protecting people, Hanna commented, they were killing them.But Jimmys thoughts were already elsewhere and, without another word he turned and hurried back toward his work area, feeding information into the screen as he went.For several moments there was silence, then Delilah sighed.That man never brings good news.In a way, she was right, but the little guy could only bring what was available.I also realized something else, that I shouldve had some idea about before: that was why Infinity were so intent on killing him, they were scared of what information hed picked up when he broke into their system and what he might add it to now he was back on the Mainland.That hed tell everyone the satellites hadnt been judgment from on high, but a plague, and that, ironically, the person being constantly described as the biggest ever threat to society was, in fact, its savior.For the rest of that day my mind was in turmoil.I had no idea if what Jimmyd said affected my plans to rescue Lena in any way, but for sure I was left with this uneasy feeling that the situation had erupted out of control yet again.I didnt bother to sit out and watch the street that night.All my confidence had been ripped right out of me.In fact, as embarrassed as I am to admit it, I felt so beaten, so pessimistic about what I was trying to do, that just for a moment it went through my head that maybe itd be best for everyone if I didnt wake up in the morning.Which, as it turned out, was a whole lot closer to the truth than I ever couldve imagined.Clancy!Clancy!Someone was calling to me from out of the darkness.Took me a while to realize it was Gordie.Yeah?I said, struggling up onto one elbow, but he didnt need to say any more.I could hear it, too: the sound of distant beating and shouting, the slight thrum of a Dragonfly over the Cityit was another Clean up.I didnt hesitate for one second, jumping to my feet so quickly I had a bit of a dizzy spell and had to stand still for a moment.No sooner had it subsided than I was ready to go.Are we still doing it?Delilah asked.I am, I said, and there was a brief pause, as if everyone was taking that in.Got everything?Jimmy asked.Yep, I said, checking my pockets, feeling the extra bulk.Good luck.Thanks.Well be at the fence.I went around and thanked everyone, hugging them, then made my way out into the dark and smoky night.Into the Fire        TWENTY Once I emerged from the dense vegetation of the shelter I could really feel the atmosphere, as if something tangible was rising up over the City, hanging there like a perfect storm about to break.I clambered across the rubble to the street, trying to work out which direction to take: sound can move in odd ways around a city, particularly with so much smoke.At first I started to walk up toward the Square, but then changed my mind, taking the next turning, heading over in the general direction of the ocean.Immediately that sound became more specific, more frightening, as it echoed along the street toward me in onrushing shock waves.Over and over that familiar thump thump thump!thump thump thump!was getting louder with every step, more threatening.I picked up my pace.I needed to work out exactly how I was going to do this before they arrived, and by the sound of it, they werent that far awayand yet the street wasnt as busy as Idve expected.I checked the other side, and glancing up an alleyway saw the crowds and panic Id been anticipatingId turned too soon.I crossed over and headed up the alleyway, at that precise moment a running mob coming bursting around the corner.I tried to dodge and weave my way through them, but there were far too many and slowly they pushed me back until I was pinned up against a wall.I fought my way out, getting jolted and shoved, punched and screamed at, but in the end I somehow managed to get through.As I got to the junction, I saw a large group of Specials marching toward me, intent on blocking off the alleyways so no one else could escape.I slipped around the corner just in time, finding the nearest doorway, keeping as far back in the shadows as I could until theyd passed and I could merge into the crowds unchallenged.I got a real shock when I took my first look down that smoky, chaotic street.Those nights they swept down our way, demolishing the church and everything else, I dont reckon theyd rounded up more than a couple of hundred peoplehere there were more like thousands: old people, desperately trying to run, to force their stiff old arthritic joints to function; kids darting from side to side like mice looking for a hole to escape; even some of the zombie sick were getting swept along with it, as if their feet werent touching the ground, that they simply didnt have the strength to resist.All of them had been flushed out of their hiding places: abandoned buildings, lean tos, storm drains, anywhere theyd mistakenly thought they were safe.And behind them, like some huge cacophonous wall rearing up toward us, came the now familiar shouting and beating, the clanking of heavy machinery, the piercing spotlights of the Dragonflies.Now that Id joined the flow and knew which way it was being driven, I had to somehow get to the front of it.The only trouble was, the amount of panic, the surging and swirling hysteria, it was damn near impossible.I tried to speed up, to even run a little, but within moments thered be some kind of obstruction and people would lose it, screaming at each other, not out of anger but just pure, blind terror.All possible exits were closed off, side streets, lanes and alleyways, doors into functioning buildings, anywhere where they thought we might be able to escape.Yet somehow I managed to slip and slide my way through, using a minimum of force, trying to ensure my progress was as uneventful as possible, acutely aware of the package I was carrying, that if it got broken, this whole thing would be off.I got shouted at a couple of times by people taking exception to me pushing past, but I just apologized as best I could and kept going.Behind me I could hear the growing thunder: the roar of the engines, the screaming chorus of the hunters, even the occasional loosed gunshot.Id known it would be an ordeal, a further vent for madness, but there was something else, too.I couldnt exactly say how, but in some way it felt different.Maybe it was the sheer scale of it, the unpredictable nature of such a huge crowd, or perhaps it had something to do with the uncertainty, that no one had the faintest idea where we were being driven.For sure I couldnt think of a square or park in the vicinity big enough to hold so many people, and if it wasnt going to be that, what the hell was it?Ive never been the greatest sports fan in the world.I used to watch a little on the screen, but the only sporting event I ever actually attended was the track with Mr.Meltoni.For sure, I had no idea where any of the Citys major sporting venues were.If I had, maybe I wouldve had second thoughts about what I was planning on doing.I kept checking the signs to see if there was any indication of an upcoming open area, but it still took me a while to realize that the only destination being regularly signposted was the stadium.Even then I didnt get it, not until it came into view, all brightly lit and glowing, and I heard the muttering of those around me.They started to cry out in protest, trying to turn around and push back the other way, knowing it could only mean something unforgivable.For a few moments they held their ground, refusing to go any further, but the Specials pushed up hard behind us, using their weaponsclubs, electro shields, shock glovesand after a bit of a struggle and several people getting zapped and writhing on the ground, the protest disintegrated and we were herded forward again, into the heart of the stadium through a long, cold tunnel.We stumbled out onto the floodlit grass, taking a few dazed and blinded steps forward, then stopped and gaped all around, realizing we werent alone.The upper stands were filled with hundreds, maybe even thousands of shooters, all sitting there surrounded by the remains of their fast food and beeror maybe sushi and champagneweapons in their hands, eagerly peering down on us.The Specials stopped their beating and a line of them quickly took up position around the periphery of the field while others blocked the exits.Two Dragonflies hovered overhead, their spotlights shining down like finely stretched luminous webs.I was so shocked for a moment all I could do was stare.This wasnt what Id imagined, not what Id had in mind at all.Id anticipated a square or park, somewhere where there would be nooks and crannies, bushes, places where I could hide if necessary.That wouldve been dangerous enoughbut out there, brightly lit and totally exposed, with nowhere to hide?It was like some huge mass firing squadwhich, I guess, was exactly what it was.All around me I could see others coming to the same conclusion, the disbelief on their faces being replaced by terror.There were cries of helplessness as they frantically looked left and right for a way to escape.I dont know what set me runningthere was nowhere to go.I could see shooters studying prospective targets through their sights, going from person to person, wondering who to take down first.One young woman in particular was smirking at me from the front row as if to say, Im gonna get that big old bastard before anyone else does and I just turned and fled, dodging around those also running, pushing aside those too scared to move.From what Id seen of Clean ups, no one was that much of a shot.I figured if I ran to the center of the field, maybeand I do mean maybegiven how inept they were, I just might manage to stay alive.Some really hap hap happy announcer welcomed everyone to the main event of the evening and started geeing them up, saying it was time to, Take out the trash!Someone started shooting even before he finishedcourse, he remonstrated with them, told them to wait for his say so, but only in a jokey way.And finally, with his voice rising to a deranged pitch, those around me screaming in terror, the shooters baying in excitement, he called out to everyone to, Clean up this City!It was like the whole world exploded.Gunshots, laser burns, jeering and howling, insanity on a scale you simply couldnt imagine.I saw the old, the young, the sick, person after person, tumbling to the ground, bodies mounting up, falling on top of each other.Many were so badly wounded they were no longer recognizable as human, but just slashed and punctured weeping chunks of meat and bone.How long it went on, I dunnoI guess it wasnt any more than a minute or two, but it felt like the most godless of infinities.It wasnt until the shooters stoppedto reload maybe, or to take another gulp of their drinksthat I heard the screaming.It was the most chilling sound thats ever entered my heada grating collision of terror and pain, and in that moment, realizing that everyone here was gonna be cut down, I knew my time had come: that it was now or never.I pretended to panic, to run blindly, dodging people, leaping over bodies, then suddenly toppled over as if Id been hit and hadnt immediately appreciated it.Colliding with the grass face first, smelling the moistness of the watered soil, hoping Id died a convincing death.I didnt make the slightest movement, just in case someone had zoomed in to make sure.I was just another lifeless corpseno more, no less.However, after a few moments, my hand began to stir and slowly inch its way down inside my parka until I eventually located the thick plastic bag Id dug out of the garbage, its precious contents slopping around inside.I slowly tugged it out and placed it under my forehead, then began to push down with all my might, straining my neck muscles, for a tense moment fearing the plastic might be too strong.Yet finally it broke, exploding all over me, drenching me in a mixture of water and my own blood that Id drained from my self inflicted wound.It covered my face, my hair, my neck and chest, and I hoped the fact that it was real blood, that it was verifiably mine, meant thered be no suspicion of my fatal wound.But that wasnt it, of course.That was the easy bit.I slowly raised my head, just the merest fraction, taking in the view around me, knowing it might well be my last glimpse of this Earth.If it was, then it sure wasnt the one I wouldve chosen.Youve never seen such carnage, nor heard such a terrible noise.The smoke was so thick now I couldnt see most of the people in the standswhich, I guessed, was the reason why a lot of them had stopped shooting.Nevertheless, there was still more than enough going on for anyone to worry about who was dead and who wasnt.Again I kept my movements slow and easy as I reached down into my other inside pocket and located my second precious package, thanking God when I drew it out and saw it hadnt been broken.With all the jostling and fighting, the heavy fall I took pretending to be shot, it wouldntve surprised me.I carefully unwrapped it, slightly rolled to one side, priming the syringe as I did so, then stuck it into my stomach and injected myself.I had just enough time to remember to throw it clear of my body before its contents went to work, and then everything around methe floodlit stadium, the shooters, the screaming of victims, and finally my consciousness itselffaded into nothing.I once took a bullet for Mr.Meltonis wife.I mean, you dont think about these things, you dont have time.Either you do or you dont, and I did.At the time, the business was going through a bit of an unsettled period, loyalties had got a little blurred and Mr.Meltoni mustve been concerned, cuz he insisted on me accompanying his wife wherever she went.Which, in her case, was pretty much always shopping.It was a duty I hated every bit as much as walking that damn dog of hers, Mitzi, though what I hated the most was when she insisted on taking it with us, so I had to put up with a double helping of humiliation.She used to make us wait outsideI mean, talk about embarrassing: standing there with this buttoned and bowed ball of expensively coiffeured fluff sitting on my shoes.And I swear that stupid pooch knew how uncomfortable I was, cuz she always added to it by pooping in the doorway of Valentino or Chanel or wherever it was.Or maybe she was just making a statement.Maybe she hated shopping as much as I did and wanted everyone to know.Either way, for a big guy to have to clear up after that little thing while all those fur coated ladies pushed by with their noses in the air was well up on the shaming scale.I remember, we were just starting to suffer winter and the first fall of snow was thick on the ground.The sidewalks hadnt been properly cleared and people were slipping and sliding all over.These two guys mustve been watching us for a while cuz they obviously knew her routine pretty well.Thursday was Gucci day and they were waiting for her just down the street.As it happened, Mrs.Meltoni had just called Mitzi and me in to give our opinion on a dress, which was another of my duties I hated.What could I say?Its nice?Its okay?And as for what I thought the dogs opinion washow the hell did I know?I mean, she was a beautiful young woman.Mr.Meltoni took good care of her.It was up to him to pass the compliments.Not that it mattered what I said, in fact, I reckon she only asked my opinion so she could ignore it.Anyways, thank the Lord, when we left that shop my arms were empty for oncewell, apart from Mitzi.I saw these two guys approaching as we made our way toward the limo.They were both carrying packages, but it was the way they were carrying themstraight out in front of themthat made me suspicious.I got this really bad feeling, a whole tidal wave of it, and suddenly had one of those moments where you become a spectator of your own actions.I just let Mitzi fall to the ground and leaped to shield Mrs.Meltoni.At that precise moment, both guys parcels were blown away by the guns they had inside them.I took one in the shoulderwell, more to the back reallyas the two guys immediately turned to run back to their vehicle, but one of them slipped, and grabbing his companion, took them both down.They were just lying there, floundering around, trying to get up, with me slumped a few feet away bleeding heavily and Mrs.Meltoni screaming out at the top of her voice.God knows what wouldve happened next; I guess theydve got to their feet eventually.But to my astonishmentmaybe cuz she was so indignant at being so unceremoniously droppedMitzi went on the attack, yapping furiously and leaping at the gunmen, getting her teeth into one guys ear.It was mayhem, old time variety, though thankfully, a patrol car just happened to be passing by.Mr.Meltoni was really grateful; he even insisted I took a spell off.For some reason, though, his wife was never the same with me again.Even worse, from then on she took to calling her mutt Mitzi the Mindershe even had it inscribed on its damn diamant collar.Forget the fact that it was me who took the bullet, that I put my body between her and two gunmen.But the point is, either you do or you dont, and despite what you might think now, you wont know until it happens.And I guess its just as well that most of us go through our lives without ever having to finding out.It really depends on who you are and what it is you want to protect.Doubtless Jimmy was right: what I was doing was suicide.Someone was probably loading a bullet or firing up a laser that had my name on it even as I passed out.But I was doing what I could to protect the woman I loved, not to mention the child wed created together, and when it comes down to it, wed all do that, wouldnt we?In a way, it was that convoy of white trucks thatd really set me thinking.The fact that they went into Infinity at more or less the same time on set afternoons.It didnt make any sense.They were clean up vehicles for transporting the dead (leaving them in dumpsters, apparently), so why did they need to go to Infinity?Of course, anyone with half a brain wouldve got it right away.When I told Jimmy, he didnt so much as bat an eyelid, as if I was doing no more than stating the all too damn obvious.If there was one thing Gordie falling victim to an enticer had taught us, it was that the transplant business was way out of control.And thanks to Jimmy, we also knew that satellite poisoning meant there was an endless queue of people clamoring for replacement organs.Nothing was coming over from the Island anymore and the price had obviously gone through the roof, so I guess it made perfect sense for Specials to go through the bodies after a Clean up, checking for any that might have something worth taking.Young people mostly, but others, toolike some old dude who looked like he mustve recently stumped up the cash for a new young kidney?Who had the typical scar of a back street transplant surgeon?Hed be taken to Infinitys hospital wing to be investigated...wouldnt he?Okay, and if youre thinking thats a fair example of taking a bullet for someone, then you still gotta little ways to go.See, even if I stayed more still than the dead themselves on that grass, getting dragged off and heaped up along with other possible donors, thered still be no chance of me getting into Infinity, cuz the moment they scanned the truck at the gate and checked life forms against Infinity personnel, itd be all over.I wouldnt have to play dead, I would be.For a while that was where I got stuck, there just didnt seem to be any way, then I remembered what Dr.Simon had done with Lena, how he was able to transport her without risk of being discovered.And that was why I went to see Jimmy, to get him to look up his analysis of what was in that syringe and make up some more.So now I hope it makes sense?I was actually standing in front of the bullet.It was on its way toward me.Jimmy had warned me a thousand times I was relying too much on conjecture, that if I had one detail wrong, made one incorrect assumption, my whole plan would come tumbling down like a troupe of weak kneed acrobats.He couldve also added that it would probably cost me my life.Whatever happened, the little guyd been determined Id come to no harm cuz of him.His role in this was absolutely crucial, his calculations had to be spot on.I dont know how big the window was between me being scanned at the gate and when the bodies started getting cut up, but for comfort I reckoned I needed to start coming around almost the moment I was inside the compound.At first hed said it was impossible, that there were far too many variablesthe strength of the mixture, my body weight, what Id eatenany number of things.And he kept punctuating his sentences with that same warning, over and over: that he wasnt any kind of chemist!I hoped he was setting himself up as usual, trying to make a task look even more difficult than it was, but there was an uncertainty about him I didnt recognize.Maybe this was too much even for Jimmy?Anyways, Im sure you can fill in the rest.After weeks of intense thought, walking the City, not sleeping at night, that was what Id come up witha shot so long it was gonna have to follow the curvature of the Earth.But what did you expect?People dont change: Im just a dumb old big guy, and to tell ya the truth, it wouldntve surprised me if Id never woken from that long cold darkness.Into the Fire        TWENTY ONE I dont know when, but at some point I realized my eyes were open, and theyd been that way for a little while.There was no thought there, though, in fact, no connection between them and any other part of my body.I guess Im dead.I have to be.I dont have any kind of physical presence at all, nothing to indicate Im still part of this world.Finally its happened...I stood in front of one too many bullets.An automatic door opens somewhere, shushing wide, vibrating when fully extended, then shushing back closed again.Someone mustve come in.But come in where?Maybe Im not dead?Maybe Im in a coma?I hear muttering voices, but I dont understand what theyre saying.It could be a foreign language, but I dont think so.Its my language; I just dont understand it.And where the hells my body?Do I have one?Has someone taken it away?Only my eyes remain, sitting in a cold dish of some unspecified solution, with just my bloodshot old pupils staring out.I feel it.Only dully at first, but slowly it becomes that bit more acute.Someones taken hold of my dish and is moving it around, slopping the solution over the sides, my eyeballs almost going with it.Be careful, will ya!Thats my only remaining contact with life.Yet eventually the dish is set down, but along with something else, that Im pressed hard up against and dont like.I think its a bodyright next to my dishand at last I realize Im not a dish at all, Im still a bag a bones old big guy.The body started rocking back and forth, as if something was causing it to vibrate.There was a saw working near me, buzzing away, eagerly going about its work.I didnt like that sound, not just the buzzing, but the material it was slicing through.It was soft, vulnerable, not at all right for the sharp whirling blade of a circular saw.And finally my mind clicked into gear enough for me to recognize what was going on: the body was being cut up.I could actually hear them going inside it, the slurping, squelching sound of them searching for anything worth taking.Now I knew where I was.I was at the butchers and he was going to slaughter me, cut me up into pieces and display me in his window: sell me in portions to be taken away and cooked, roasted or barbecuedJeez, I had to get outta there.I had to cram myself back into my body, fill it from head to toe, and make it whisk me away.I tried to move, but they mustve secured me somehow; I couldnt budge, not even lift a finger.All I could manage was to open and shut my eyes.I tried again, my brain sending out the necessary signals, but still my body remained dormant, dead.I heard more movement, the sounds of people lifting a substantial weight: another body, maybe.The one next to me, the one theyd cut up and ransacked, was dragged away.I heard it thump heavily down onto the floor.Jesus!Was it my turn?Someone ran something down my scarmaybe his finger?and made some comment about what a botched job it was...Hey!Wait a moment!I felt that!My body was beginning to respond, to regain some sensation.And at that precise moment, the circular saw was turned on again, whirring back into life, and I could hear it coming toward me.I wanted to jump up, to get away from there as fast as I could, but I still couldnt move.Time and time again I sent the message out, begging my body to do what I was asking, til finally, I tried so hard that body and mind collided and I sort of convulsed.Shit!a male voice near me criedI guess the guy whod been holding the circular saw.Whats the matter?asked another male from the other side of the room.He moved!Dylan!He fucking moved!Hes just settling!Its rigor mortishes been dead for a day.The guy with the circular saw never replied but I could feel him standing there watching me.I dug down as deeply as I could, searching for the places where I was re forming, where my mind and body were spluttering back into life, and finally I managed to turn and look him in the face.Jesus!he gasped, dropping the circular saw and jumping back.Despite my head feeling as if it weighed substantially more than my entire body, I still managed to raise it up a few inches.I hadnt been so wrong about it being a butchers: that was exactly what it looked like, with bodies, parts of bodies, limbs and innards strewn everywhere.Kill him!came the voice from across the other side of the room.Fuck!...Fuck!his stunned companion kept repeating as he backed further away, and finally realizing I wasnt secured at all, I struggled up on one elbow.I was on a long bench, one of maybe twenty or thirty bodies, most of them, it pains me to say, children.I tell ya, Ive never seen anything so repulsive, so utterly inhuman, in all my life.The guy on the other side of the room despaired of his companion and came at me with a large knife.I didnt know if I had the strength, the coordination, anything at all, to fight him, but grabbed this stool next to the bench and started swinging.The only problem was, I was lurching and swaying around like Id been on a bender for the last two weeks.He started jabbing the knife at me, partly posturing, partly hoping to do me some damage.I waited til I thought he was in range then swung the stool at him as hard as I could, almost swinging myself off my feet and missing him by the proverbial country mile.But the effort, the need to make myself function, was starting to accelerate my recovery.I swung again, this time only missing by half a country mile.One further attempt andI gotta admit, more by accident than anythingI managed to knock the knife out of his hand.He immediately tried to run but hit the bench and I was able to get in a good shot to the head and down he went.I turned, lurching toward the door, trying to cut the other guy off, managing to nail him just as he was frantically punching the door open button.But ya know, my body mightve been swinging back into operation, but my mind was still fumbling around for the on switch.For several seconds I just stood there, frowning at the guys on the floor, wondering who the hell they were...Where was I?What was I doing there?I went to the door, opened it a crack and peered out into a long shiny corridor smelling of antiseptic: a hospital, for sure, which explained the bodies, but not what was going on.Why were they being cut up?And whered they come from?And then slowly, I started to get a feeling, not remembering exactly, but a sense that something terrible had happened.Something was skulking in a corner of my mind; something I knew Id regret remembering...People being killed...carnage...slaughter.And just like I was in the dark of that stadium and theyd turned on the lights, it all came back to me.Jesus!This must be Infinity!The plan worked!God bless ya, Jimmy, I knew I could count on you...And that meantoh my God!I was somewhere near Lena!I went to the door and checked the corridor again.I needed two things: one, to know her exact location, and twocuz it wouldve been picked up by the scanner if Id tried to smuggle one insome kind of firearm.I had to wait a while, but finally saw a Special approaching.I ducked back in til he was just about level with me, then leapt out and grabbed him, yanking him into the room.I hit him in the stomach, winding him, and as he collapsed to the floor, grabbed his laser.He started to struggle, but stopped when he felt his own weapon jammed up against his temple.Wheres Lena?I asked.Who?Wheres the woman theyre holding?Wheres Dr.Simon?I demanded, pressing the laser harder, making an indentation on his forehead.He hesitated just long enough for me to be sure he knew what I was talking about.I dont know!I didnt have time to play games.I flicked the laser to stun and shot him in the leg and he doubled up in agony.Id try harder if I were you.He just lay there, moaning with pain, but I went to shoot the other leg.No!No!he begged.Five seconds, I told him, but he didnt need them.Top floor, he cried, Everythings up there.I upped the laser a little more and shot both him and the two butchers laying comatose on the floor in the head.By the time they came around, Id either be far away or back lying on that table.As I made way down the corridor an alarm went off.I didnt know if it was something Id done, or what Jimmy was up to over by the fence, but as I searched for the elevator, several people who shouldve challenged me were too busy looking out the window, giving out with these little gasps and cries, the occasional stunned expletive, which I guessed meant the growlers were out.I found the stairs and decided to take them, glancing out the window on my way up and sure enough, seeing a pack of growlers over by the fence.It took me a couple of moments to appreciate that they had someone down on the ground, that they were jostling each other to get in on the kill.I briefly panicked, thinking it might be Jimmy or one of the kids, but I could just about make out a Specials uniform.What the helld happened, I didnt know.Maybe there was some kind of misunderstanding or malfunction?Surely the growlers could be turned off if necessary?Or maybe Jimmyd done something?Whatever, the guy was paying dearly; even from where I was, I could hear his screams.It wasnt hard to work out why hed gone over there.Someoneand though I couldnt see them clearly, with all that grace and poise, it just had to be Hannahad climbed the fence and was now surfing the cameras; riding one, doing a couple of little ballet steps, pirouetting around, kicking out the lens, then stepping off and waiting for the next.That was probably whatd set off the sirens.The guy mustve gone over there to stop her, maybe shoot her down, but with the aid of the growlers, Hannas dance of destruction was carrying on unimpeded.Knowing how competitive Gigi was, I wouldve expected to see her over there riding cameras too, but there was no sign, and it went through my head that maybe that was just the slightest cause for hope.If she wasnt with them, maybe she was overseeing a little inside helpfor sure, it was beginning to look like Id need it.When I got to the top floor, it was the same story as below: more and more people were clustering around the windows.It left the lawn!a woman squealed, obviously talking about a growler.Look!Some kinda malfunction, an older Special told her, trying to sound reassuring.Theyll fix it.How am I going to get home?I hadnt really appreciated just how much of a distraction the growlers would be.I saw this corridor leading off the reception area with a private sign over it and had almost sneaked down there without anyone noticing.However, at the last moment the older Special glanced back and caught me.Hold it!he shouted, drawing his weapon.I ran as laser blasts started instantly scoring the walls and floor around me.Turning, firing back, I managed to drop this young guy coming after me and made it to the end of the corridor and around the corner.There were several doors in front of me, but only one with a couple of guards posted on it.The nearest guy just about got his weapon up and pointed in my direction, but I got my shots away first, leaping over both bodies before theyd even settled.I tried the door, to my relief finding it unlocked.Nothing mattered to me in that moment other than the person I was desperately hoping to see inside, in whose eyes I prayed I was about to live.However, when I got in there, I was met by an empty room, large, expensively furnishedthey really were taking good care of herand yet, the moment that thought entered my head that this was where shed normally be, I knew something was wrong.Even if it was an unfamiliar place, I should still get a sense of her.I heard a commotion out in the corridor and punched the button to deadlock the door, then, just to make sure, melted it with my laser, grateful to see that the whole thing was heavily reinforced.No one would be coming through there for a while.I was tempted to just call out her name, to shout it in the way Id wanted to for so long, but caution urged me to go quietly.I went through the door at the end of the room into a short hallway and was confronted by two other doors, one slightly ajar.A mans voice came from insideJesus, it was only a few words, but I knew who it was immediately.Dr.Simon!I pushed the door open as slowly as I could, inch by inch, breath by breath, dearly hoping to see Lena.However, she wasnt there.It was someone else, and I gotta say, one of the most disturbing sights Ive ever seen in my life.Dr.Simon stood there in all his usual fineryimmaculately tailored suit, pristine white shirt, shiny silk tie; hair that had never spent more than two weeks away from a hairdressers scissors or two minutes from a combbut this time, however, he was jacketless, and his sleeves were rolled up as he massaged someone on the table.I say someone, but it couldntve been more obvious who it was.Nora Jagger was stretched out on her front, utterly naked, though that wasnt the first thing to strike me about her.The doc was working on her legs, or what little there was of them.See, Gigi had been right: she really had had all her limbs removed, and I tell ya, it really shook me.It wasnt what she looked like, it was what shed done.How could she?What sorta person would have their arms and legs cut off so they could attach strongermore lethalartificial ones?I mustve made a noise, let out a groan or something, cuz suddenly they both turned toward me.Nora Jaggers reaction was instantaneousshe was off that table and scrambling across the room with surprising agility.
