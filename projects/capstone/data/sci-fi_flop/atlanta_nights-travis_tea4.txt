Some briefs spurt of happiness that was all.It hadnt meant anything  not to her.It was  all going wrong.There, he growled, his tone of voice    betraying his deep seeded anger.The  burgers are cooked.Penelope drew back from his rough beha vior, her lovely face shaping itself into  puzzled lines.Honey, she ventured, you ...you sound so angry.Im not angry!Bruce denied.Pulling   out his wrought iron patio chair with a  clatter, he hurled himself down onto it, his  actions contra punting his words.He shoved  the tray toward them.Go on.Eat them.Isadore surged to his feet, his rock     hard muscles rippling and his red tail  bouncing.I dont think Pen wants to, he barked.Oh no?Bruce shot back.And how would you know?Because, Isadore tilted forward, his eyes clutching Bruces like pincers, his tone  low and menacing.I know shes a vegetarian.Whic h you, my friends, seem to have  forgotten.Penelope let out a soft gasp.Bruce sat like  a statue turned to stone feeling despair  engulf him like a black blanket of horro r dragging itself over all his senses.Isadore is  right, he acknowledged to himself in heart rendering misery.I did forget.Its all my fault.Ready to go, Pen?Isadore demanded masterfully.I. ..I guess so, she hesitated.Isadore gave Penelope his arm, his ro ck hard biceps bulging under the sleeve of  his white tee shirt like potatoes in a flour   sack.Hesitatingly she took it.Together they strode out of the patio and vanished into the night, leaving Bruce s itting forlornly at the  table staring at the hamburger patties on their tray, smoking like the charred ashes of his  dreams, while inside his head he was listening to his mothers laughter.12         The reception was a disaster for Callie from the moment she stepped into the hall.Clearly famished from weeks of living on Xena drin and Diet Pepsi, she made a beeline  for the appetizers.The Swedish meatballs   were obviously the most fatty thing on the  table.To her dilated pupils those little red  tinged morsels of mad cow must have looked  like manna in the making.But as soon as  she picked up a tasseled toothpick, the damn  meatball launched itself off the stick and made its sticky, greasy, ambling way down the  corset of her Vera Wang bridal gown, over all that hand crocheted tulle, and splattered its  death throes on the open toe of her Jimmy Choo shoes.The bride backed away from the table,  letting out a strangled gurgle and waving  her French manicured fingers in the air.She began hyperventilating.A cadre of caterers  descended upon her, seltzer, bleached linen napkins, and industrial strength cleansers at the ready.Those wedding pictures were goi ng to have to be photoshopped for days to  make that dress ever look ivory again.I backed up, trying to hide the fact that  I was laughing so hard I was afraid I was  going to spray shrimp cocktail all over my Ma nolo Blahniks.Of course, I backed right  into Richard Isaacs.We hadnt said three   words to each other at the church, but Id  immediately spotted him there.His Armani  suit was so sharply pressed I imagined you  could cut cheese with the creases.Being a stock manipulator, and a police stoolie, hed  probably stolen more cheeses than hed cut.Still, it was hard to ignore his ruddy, good  looks.I knew he had a yacht anchored on the Outerbanks, and his aftershave helped his  allure by retaining a hint of sea air.The blue  in his Ralph Lauren tie made his eyes seem  more piercing, and the gray encroaching ar ound his temples had yet to establish a firm  beachhead on the rest of his scalp.Yvonne, he said, in a gravelly voice that  hinted of a two pack a day habit only  recently dropped.I was hoping I would bump into you.Rub up against me was more like it.He hadnt moved more than a millimeter  since my well toned derriere had grazed his hi p.   We both watched in silent amusement  as Callies groom, Bruce, forced his way through the sea of starched aprons to comfort  his fainting flower of a bride.Now Bruce, I heard the frail flower   snap.You just go away and let these  professionals do their work.Go get mah Aunt Eustace some champagne.Dutifully, Bruce left Callie to her sta  ff and went to get some liquor for Aunt  Eustace.Echoing what I was thinking, Richard wh ispered, Do you think she sent him to  the oldest, ugliest broad here because shes already afraid of comparisons to younger,  prettier company?Here he patted me on my  back as if to let me know who the young,  pretty, company was.Now Callies only got maybe five years on  me.And I know for a fact that shes  still got all her natural software and she keeps it in good shape at the gym.Being a lady I  would never mention some of her other habits.Besides, whats a little Botox between us  girls?Still, I was flattered that Rich ard would include me with the younger set.Considering Callie was totally robbing the cr adle marrying dear, little Bruce (for Gawds  sake, shes old enough to be his Mother!)I wa s enjoying Richards attention.Of course,  hes old enough to be my father.But lets just say I like them with a little steel in their  girders.Plus he still has shoulders you could hang a lion off of.I decided to go for the gusto.So, Richar d, I said.Think you can help me with  a little problem Im having?Richard backed up a few inches.What did he think I was going to ask him for?Help with insurance?Stocks tips?What to do about some incorrigible STD?I lost my navel ring.Somewhere over by  the gift table.I was hoping you could  help me look for it.His eyes lit up with a predatory gleam.I hoped it wasnt just the idea of finding  gold.I planned to have him panning for more  than a little circle.I was looking for the  big O myself.Over at the gift table I did a full bend ove r to scan the floor.From his position I  was sure he couldnt miss a good gander at my leopard thong.It didnt really go with the fuchsia bridesmaids confection I was stuck in, but I felt it added a little  je ne sais quoi to  a rather dowdy outfit.Besides, it set off my  auburn tresses better than fuchsia.Fuchsia,  for Gawds sake.Callie wasnt being shy a  bout trying to make all us other girls look  bad!Ah, but back to my prey.Its just a little  old, navel ring with an emerald on it.I  heard it go clink when I dropped Callies gift    off.I felt I needed some fortification  before hunting under the table for it.Here,  I raised my glass of Veuve Clicquot, and he  gallantly clinked his Baccarat crystal agains t mine.Care to help me look?I asked,  straightening up and giving him the benefit of my fully bleached smile.He gave me a frank, appraising stare.At least I hope the stare was for me.He  could have been tallying up how much silver and how many checks there were lying on  that big, round, table, but I suspected the thought of my thong was more enticing.Coming?I asked, holding up a corner of  the tablecloth.Taking a quick glance  around the room, I saw that only a bemuse     d waiter, who was holding his champagne  bottle at the ready, was watching us.All the other guests were too involved with the  dress drama to give our portion of the room a gander         Without looking to see if he would follow, I crawled under the table.Fortunately,  the cream carpeting was very thick.Now Id see what he was made of.If he was as  stuffed as his shirt, he would probably beat a quick retreat from such a silly situation.I held my breath for a few moments.Just  as I was starting to feel really foolish, I  heard him enter our little domain from the r  ear.He was awkwardly clutching a nearly  full bottle of champagne.I brought reinforcements, he said, as he poured more bubbly into my glass.In  case we get stuck here for a while and need to fortify ourselves for the search.Ah, a man after my own heart.All ready to liquor up for love.We clinked glasses again.Now what exactly are we looking for?he asked with a grin.Oh, just a little golden O, I say.Its   got a bit of green emerald, just like my  eyes.I batted my eyelashes at him, in case he had somehow failed to notice my  startlingly beautiful color.Encouraged by his attention, I continued.First we pat the rug, I say.Kicking  off my slingbacks, I run my feet seductively over the carpet and all around his pant leg.To his credit, Richard immediately took     off his shoes, and socks, and began  running his toes through the lush carpeting.So what do we do when this doesnt  work?he asked.Well we can start crawling around looki  ng for it on hands and knees, I say.Taking care not to bump my head on the bottom of the table, I yet again favored him with  a view of my pert derriere.Leaving hi s shoes behind, he clam bered onto his own hands  and knees and followed me around.Ooh, I say.Feel here.I move his hand just over my knee.Is that something  we should be looking into further?I ask.I dont know, he responds, fondling my knee in earnest.Let me see if I can  find the gold.In a move I would think was  practiced, if not for the awkward angles we  are at which keep our head from bopping on th  e table, he climbs swiftly over me, and  shoves his knees up between my legs.Let me see what I can feel, he whispers.Moving his hands up from my knees to run over my hi ps, then my tummy, they come to rest on  the points of my push up bra.He rubs     his fingers in concentric circles around my  breasts.I havent had such a thorough feel  since my last gyno exam.And Richards  hands are mercifully warm.His tongue reaches up to caress my ear.I can feel him  nibble around the diamonds in my lobe.Unable to resist I say, But what about my navel  ring?One hand leaves my breast and tries    to find a way to enter my skintight dress.When he cant find an easy entry, he reaches up under the skirt and pinches my belly  button.Your navel feels perfect without orname ntation, he whispers breathily in my  ear.But for engineering this rather unique experience, I promise to take you to Tiffanys  where you can pick out the emerald of your  choice.Unless, and here he pushes my bum  into the rug, leaning his full weight against me, so I can feel how ready he is for an  adventure.Unless, he says again, You want to roll around some more and see what we  can find.I struggle slightly, wondering when I lo st the upper hand in this seduction.My  foot hits the champagne bottle and cold bubbly spills over, adding a tingly sensation to  my toes.As his hand has now slipped from      my navel to my love shack, Im in no  position to do more than wiggle.I have to  muffle my moans by biting down hard on his  tie, because all around us I hear guests return ing to the room.His hand moves inside of  me with the skill of many years of experience.This is why I like my men with a little  steel in their girders, I think.None of these pretty boys of Callies will ever know how to  do this so quickly or so well.The band finally stops playing that insipid Butterfly Kisses.Trust Callie to  choose something so banal, and it moves on to   the Stones.Richard seemed more than  ready to Pump me up.He moved his hand from my boob and we were so close I could  feel the tension of the teeth as his zipper  slowly uncoiled.When I felt his muscle move  against me I realized he had been going   commando.I got wet just thinking about it.Proving how strong he was he snapped the  reinforced lace waistband on my thong one   handed.As I felt his missile seeking my s ilo with all the power  of American know how  behind it, I readied for the first strike.All of a sudden, I saw the unmistakably    cheap shoes of the champagne toting  waiter appear inches from my nose.Ther e was a soft knock on the table over my head.Cheesit, the jig is up, I heard the waiter   say.Your champagne has soaked into the  tablecloth and theyre bringing over a new one, before all the gifts get wet.I moaned with frustration and rolled my   hips, trying to get a taste of Nirvana  before the world could stop my fun.But   Richard was already rolling over and zipping  up.Another time, Ma Cherie, he said.Without even a final kiss, he was gone.Ooh, hell pay for that,  I thought.And gathering  up my thong, along with the  scattered threads of my dignity, I prepared to  dance my ass off for the rest of the night.The Atlanta rain came down hard and glitzy blue and transparent in a gorgeous  murky haze over the bustling city, as the popular  and highly exclusive caf reposed in its  cozy yet diffidently a corner nest along the  posh avenue lined with trees and littered with  pedestrians and people walking and their various and sun dried pets.They sat at a table near the window, wa     tching the traffic and the gentle yet  soothing pitter patter of the little feet that sounded in their earlobes but that was the  purity of the rain.Rain soothed and made gently the souls musings.Isadore Trent lazily perused the me       nu of this trendy place, filled with  extravagantly outrageous and overpriced items such as  foie de grass and pate.The wine  list alone made his pocketbook shudder with     delicacy, but of course he pretended he could afford it all and more and then he   merely put down the menu with a sniffling  disdain and addressed the companions across the table from him.What a great lunch, eh, Isaac?What will you be having?Not sure yet, replied Isaac Stevens, the older man, hair close trimmed and  distinctive and beard pepper and salt imposing, and gave a satisfied smirk and a wink.I  think Id like to watch the scenery first.I know how you and Bruce Lucent love this kind  of thing too.Young rutting fellows that you   are.And he motioned with a brave and  subtle rotation of his steady eyes, not toward the rainy window, but at the passing buxom  and slender waitresses and well dressed  young women being seated a little away from  them, two tables down.His eyes were visibly popping with sensual overloads.Yes, keep looking, old man, said Henry Archer in the empty seat next to them.Only Isadore could hear that voice,     ringing like a bell of the Notre Dame  Cathedral in his mind, and resounding in the dinnerware, and rebounding in the cutlery  and the window glass, for Henry Archer wa s dead and buried, his post accident twisted  body rotting in his resplendent grave, for he c ould definitely afford it, and his wife Callie  whod inherited his millions, was just decent  enough to respect his last wishes regarding  his own corpse of his very self.Callie, the frigid socialite arrogant woman.How is business, or should I even ask?said Isadore, with his red hair pulled  back in a casual yet stylish ponytail, hard bodied, and gushing sex appeal as only a 20   year old young man could, in his very prime of  existence and radical experience of life.He had no need to stare at the women pa  ssing by, because they continuously stared at  him, watched his redheaded careless macho  yet a sensitive ponytail, his rippling muscles  concealed under neat casual wear.He drew them like a magnet drew hungry flies.Thats what you think you are, said Henry Archer, the eternal voices in his very  mind.But you are not, you know.You are not.Not ever.The rain continued to beat down, first patter then come down in drizzles, and for a  moment Isadore was distracted enough by the  eternal rhythmic sound to gaze outside the  window, and just look at the sublime incandes cent beauty of the city nature flourishing  before him.Weeping, crying, haze and silv ery shadows stood leaning in the air before  the window.A young passerby woman paused, lean ing to pick up a bag that fell into a  puddle, and for a moment she reminded him       of Irene with her long blond hair and  voluptuous straining body, oh so a ripe acacia fragrant mouth.Yes, she was a hot number, that one,  mused Henry Archer, ghostly and virile  just below his ear, and across the table in that empty and ominous seat.Hush, bastard, you devil!Isadore wanted to say, but couldnt, because Irenes  father, Isaac Stevens would think he mad, or worse, he would begin to suspect.Irene was  there in his mind, and so was Henry Archer who grinned in his suave manner, once again  reminding by his confident glossy white teeth why her had been his willing mistress and  lover.There is the matter of Richard Isaacs, of course, said Isaac suddenly and quietly  through the sedate thicket of his distinc tive beard, putting down the menu on top of the  plate and inadvertently making the water glass  clank gently and ricochet merrily against  the salad fork.Yes, I know.The rain pitter pattered and there was silence in the noisy caf, or maybe in their  minds.Silence.Noisy caf noise.Moments later, their young strawberry auburn headed waitress attended them  with a pleasing winsome grin full of healthy  teeth and gums.Her generous bosom swept  forward in her tightfitting blouse, unbuttoned  precariously and yet full of devious intent  to reveal the tender rosy heaving flesh under the starched straining cotton.What may I get you, gentlemen?she said in a honey pert voice, and a flash of  white pearly teeth in a face of unusual refine  ment for such a creature.What was she  doing hear in this seething and empties a trendy morass of human dross and raging  worldly clamor?Ah, mused, Isadore to himself, She  is another unfortunate, probably alone in  the world and needing to pay her way in the world of men.She may be writing a novel in  secret, and I know her kind.And he had an  immediate need to comfort and console her,  and felt a pang of desire in his southern regions of the hard young body.Give us another minute, honey, will you?said Isaac, grinning at the waitress  and winking gently like an older man who is respectable, no doubt, yet has spent a wild  youth sowing his wild oats and a bit of wheat and barley too.Would you like some more water, sir?said the nubile waitress, addressing  Isaac, but Isadore felt her posture straining to ward him like Jack toward the beanstalk of  his dreams.He could almost read her eagerne ss to serve him, not the other.The world  narrowed and spun, then receded like the glory of the outer rain and inner worldliness.Silence and moments of pitter patter.You are the one with a sex death wis    h, hissed Henry Archer in his ghostly  presence permeating the room.Just look at her, you know she wants you.They all want  you.Except Irene!You could never have her, because she will always be mine.She  cannot ever forget my youthful bodybuilder physique, the firmness and the rock hardness  of me, the only things that would satisf  y.  Her father does not know that his sweet  innocent Irene was a wildcat in my bed.I   could always make her mew.And to my  musical key, none other.She purred for me  like a bobcat kitten before it became fully  grown, gained poundage and muscle bulk, and  discovered other wildlife of its kind and  ilk.Vibrant, innocent but sensual, purring.Ever purring for me, she was         Actually, I think I am ready to order now , said Isadore, firmly ignoring it all,  flipping back his red forelocks out of his  face and beyond the back to where the bulk of  the abundant and suggestive ponytail rested against his wide strongly utterly virile back   a back that could do the beast with two back s so well, when one of the two backs came  into question and under scrutiny (but the ot her back of course depended on the woman  writhing with him, under him and on top of him ah, the beasts they would make!).He ignored the voice of Henry Archer and the ghostly vacant and evacuated  presence among them, and concentrated on  thoughts of lunch and  thoughts of Richard  Isaacs, while retracting and folding away a ll distracting thoughts such as Irenes blond  fairness to the back of his subconscious mentality.We really should talk to Richard about  his behavior, said Isaacs low baritone  while the waitress deftly and smoothly poured   water over his shoulder into Isadores  glass and then Isaacs glass.Her bosom was  almost spilling outside and the depth of her cleavage was undeniable, like the depths of    the liquid in the clear cool jug and the  profundity of the dripping rain outside.Isadore visibly forced himself to     unglue his eyes from the panorama of  mummeries and femininity, and said, I will have the lightly braised spring lamb  au jus,  and a vinaigrette au coq.Would you like soup or salad?said the  waitress in a breathless soprano.Her  impressive mammary watch was inches away from Isaacs distinctive bearded face.Salad, please, and what kind of dressi ng do you have?said Isadore, lifting his  sensual narrowed eyes from his table se tting and allowing them free reign and bounce  over her lovely face.We have French, Italian, Sun ripened tomato and Avocado, Thousand Islands,  honey mustard, low cal French, low cal Ita lian, low cal Thousand Island, Oriental Thai  Oregano, and a house dressing with secret ingredients, which I highly recommend            Go ahead, order the French, mocked Henry Archer.You know Irenes French  kisses were sublime and yes I tasted them repeatedly and dolefully.Low cal Italian, said Isadore, neve r blinking, yet narrowing his eyes and then  widening them in involuntary but firm pup il dilation and watching the wavelength and  frequency of her eyes, so that the waitress wa s the first one to blink away, but first she  heaved her chest in an automotive reflex that was not to be denied.As I was saying, Richard has gone too far at this point, interjected Isaac  Stevens, pulling down the white linen napkin   sterile like Cassie Archer yet pure like  Irene Stevens  on his lap.I saw him the ot her day at the Racquet Club, and he looked  pale and just sick withexhaustion.Wonder whats the matter this time.The waitress jotted down Isadores order,  then looked at Isaac with the patience  of a saint who has to work tables in order  to support a family and possibly just a writing  habits, not to mention, pay bills and federal taxes.Isadore picked up his water glass ruefull y, considering what was within, a cousin  of the rain pattering on the window, and drew  the parallel between the microcosm in the  glass and the macro cosmos outside.No, one is pure, not even the rain, said Henry Archers hateful ghostly voice.Isadores fingers shook so that in that moment he spilled some of the cool and  refreshing once tap but now double filtered c    ontents of the glass    just droplets of  mountain spring purity    onto his shirt.Ah!Isadore exclaimed, and grabbed a napkin  to dab at his shirt in some confusion,    while Isaac and the waitress, and the whole  restaurant, and possibly the whole world star ed at him, and the moment extended itself  into eternity and then redoubled upon itself  like the emulsifying and moisturizing nature  of the rain.In the empty seat across the table, Henry Archer cackled like an evil genie  without a bottle to return to, nor needing one , since he was fully dead, and Isadore could  make himself believe it at long last.His spirit and conscience hung boldly in the air while the rain outside continued  to come down in the greatest flood.And Isadore suddenly felt himself refres hed and free of shame and guilt and able  to speak at last.He opened his mouth, cleared his throat      , swallowed the past, digested the  moment, and started to honestly speak to Isaac Stevens about Richard Isaacs.In the deepest closet back of his mind, how ever, there will always be the rain and  Irene with her raining liquid blond hair, th  e complex daughter of his lunch companion  and confidante.The rain came down.Oh, joyous yet serene emancipated rain.Penelope sat, sipping a Peach Martini (her third) while the staff hustled all around  her table.She hadn't been back to Atlantas Food 101 restaurant since graduating college,  but it had the merits of terrific food, no loud  music, and excellent bartender, and, above  all else, there was absolutely no connection  to her time with Bruce.She had no few fond  memories of the place, and the memories were justified.Just since she'd arrived, no fewer  than 3 guys (2 Pro hockey players and a Minor  League pitcher) had hit on her.Once, she  would have enjoyed their attentions.Now, she was impatiently awaiting Andrea's arrival.Andrea who never came on time unless sh e happened to be laying on someones  watch during sex.Andrea who was gorgeous in   ways even Penelope could appreciate,  since Bruce had never given Andrea a second  glance.Yet, she was engaged to Bruces college roommate, Jeff, and still had managed to retain her friendship with Penelope  despite Jeffs requests not to.Penelope was just signaling her buff, young  waiter Greg to bring another Martini  when Andrea appeared, striding swift toward  her table.Her lean, 5 6 frame and dancers  leg with calves pulling tautly as she appr oached, had heads turning up and down the  aisle.When she bent over and kissed Penel ope on the cheek, 2 guys nearly fell off their  chairs, and another received a vicious, teeth rattling smack from his female companion.Andrea was breathless, causing her chest to  heave enough to sea sicken even the  mightiest of sailors."I'm so sorry I'm late.We were in a planning meeting this morning  when the main server failed, and it's been nonstop phone time with our clients all day. "So spoke Ms.Temporary Secretary.Penelope waved over Greg."It's OK.Let' s just get you a drink. "Within moments  there were delivered 2 Peach Martini, and a Sex on The Beach for Andrea.The women  sipped and made small talk over a plate of appetizers, though Penelope was itching to get  to her main concern.Penelope's simple Caesar Salad and Andrea's North Georgia Trout had finally  arrived when she finally broached the main issue."Are you going to tell me?Or are we  both going to pretend it never happened?"Andrea said with a sigh, "How about le t's do that, Penny?It's done.Terminado.Do we have to go through all the details?The Pre Nup is singed, the rings are exchanged,  and the gift checks cashed.Let it go.Let him go. "Penelope shook her head, her ponytail wavi ng behind her as if to swat a platoon  of troublesome flies."I need to  hear it, Andrea.I need to hear it for myself before I can relegate him to the arms of that wo   man, and move on.Once you tell me about the  wedding, I can put Bruce behind me for good. "A  small, childlike part of her petulantly  crossed the dainty fingers of her left hand where it lay out of sight in her lap.Andrea took a deep breath that nearly shattered the already precarious equilibrium  of her blouse's buttons."All right.If you rea lly need to torture yourself, I will.The  ceremony and reception were held at the Archer place. "Penelope snorted."It was probably as much an exorcism of her husband's spirit as  it was a wedding. "Andrea raised her hand with all the author ity of a 20 year veteran school crossing  guard on a rainy Spring afternoon."If you're    going to be like that, I'm not going to  continue.Jeff isn't thrilled that you and I are  still friends, but out of respect for me, lets  just get this over with. "Penelope nodded."Sorry.Go on. "Andrea nibbled as she spoke, covering the initially distasteful taste of the tale  with the smoky richness of restaurants' speci   al recipe BBQ sauce."There were only  about 50 guests, mostly on Bruce's side.Ca  llie doesn't have much family, and I guess  most of her guests were business associates from Archer's business. "Andrea paused for a sip of Sex before   plunging on with all the subtlety of the  neckline of her favorite blouse."Before you ru in this already awkward story, yes, Callie  wore white.And her bouquet was Calla Lillies.Cute touch, no?That Personal Assistant  of hers ...Maude?...Milicent?...whoever ...was the Maid of Honor.Bruce and Jeff  wore gray tuxes, with white sneakers.It was a very simple ceremony, and Bruce's mother  cried the whole time.To be honest, I half e xpected you to jump out of the shrubbery, or from a helicopter, or something screaming S top this mockery of a marriage!when the  minister asked if anyone knew any reason why these two should not be married.Penelope glowered a bit, but Andrea rushed ahead having warmed greatly to her  tale."Jeff gave a marvelous toast.He told   that story about the night Bruce and those  basketball players stole all the bread that had  been delivered to the college cafeteria, and  there was no bread for meals the next day, and how he woke Jeff at 3 a. m. , and clobbered  him with a loaf of French bread, and there was bread all over the floor of their room, and  Jeff ended up cleaning it up, but how they've stay  ed friends ever since.That story still  cracks me up, though I guess it's more touching  now that I see what a bonding moment it  was for them. "Penelope waited while Andrea finished o  ff the last of her ribs.Much as she  generally liked Andrea, the girl had a certa  in flighty    no, make that "airheaded"     quality to her personality that was scratching at Penelope's nerves like a cat with 7 paws  in a sofa factory.Why couldn't she see that Bruce's marriage was not a subject to be taken  humorously.Andrea let out a burp, not so manly a belch  as to attract undue attention to them,  but not so ladylike that one or two heads di d not turn their way again.Wiping her mouth  delicately and fiddling about with the few ti ny fish bones on her plate, she went blithely  on.And their vows were so lovely, Penny.Th  ey wrote them themselves, and I never  knew a computer geek like Bruce could be so eloquent.Callie went first, and she said the  loveliest things about Bruce and them and  their relationship.How he had pulled her up  from the deepest depths of her mourning, and given her reason to rise from her bed in the morning light, and yet still more and greater r eason to return to it at nightfall.She swore  to love him all the days of his life.Penelopes mind decided this was a fine   moment to play heckler to this divine  comedy.Wonderful.She means to outlive this husband, too!Andrea was oblivious to this bleak inte rnal exchange.And Bruces vows.Oh,  Penny!You would have been so proud to hear him say such things.He went on about  how Callie was the Tech Support Agent who       had taken him off a Musales Hold and  brought him through the ultimate upgrade of the Operating System of his heart, and made  his thus far sad and lonely existence 100%     compatible with life, the universe and  everything.I was so moved I made Jeff quote every tech specification he could remember  while we made love that night.You have no  idea how hot that stuff can make a girl!We  should try to get you a computer nerd of your own.Penelope barely registered the last of Andreas tale, as the harsh reality of the  situation struck her with all the destructive force of reality.Bruce had no feelings for her.That demanding woman had rebooted his me  mory, erasing all the good, warm, tender  history theyd shared.She was nothing but a part  of that sad and lonely existence from  which he was fleeing.He felt nothing for the   time theyd shared.Nothing for all the  amazingly raunchy and kinky things shed allo wed him to do to her (or had she do to  him) when his Internet explorations had in troduced him to one of the many particularly  exotic forms of foreplay that had kept  them abed on many a night, and many a feigned  sick day from work.Penelopes vision slowly closed in on he r, leaving her finally aware of only two  things: Andrea licking her lips while describing the decadently delicious German Black Forest wedding cake.The thought  Why did Henry Archer have to die?Why couldnt it  have been Bruce?With that, she lapsed into unconsciousness, earning a bruise on her  forehead from her fork, and a crouton up her   nose before buff Greg carried her to the  managers office, and called 911.Less than sixty seconds after she'd come  through the front door at Bruce Lucent  and Callie Archer's wedding reception,     Yvonne Perrin knew she was in trouble."Hey there!How's my very favoritest bridesmaid?"Yvonne looked around just in time to dodge a beefy faced and obviously drunk  man who was trying to kiss her."I'm not                                                                        "         "You remember me I'm Uncle Roger!"he said."I was at the rehearsal dinner. "He  tottered slightly, then pulled a mashed l  ooking disposable camera out of his pocket."Let's get one of these nice people           to take our picture together, huh?"She knew how  that would work: he'd get his arm around her for a good long  grope and a couple of wet kisses, while some  other hapless guest took forever to figure out the camera's dead simple controls.She priv ately vowed that if she couldn't get out of  it, she was going to do the whole thing with   a lovely smile on her face and one of her  spike heels planted squarely in            the middle of Uncle Roger's foot.Mercifully, the little cellphone in her handba g chose that moment to start ringing.She transferred the bag to her Uncle Roge r side hand, made an apologetic "just a sec"  face, and flipped open the phone."Maria Lisa?"said an unfamiliar voice.Yvonne beamed."Hi, honey!I've been looking for you, too. ""Maria?Estas?                                                                 "The guy on the phone sounded urgent.That wa     s probably why he'd dialed the wrong  number."Estoy en mi casa.Necesito ir a mi trabajo. ""They are?Right now?"Yvonne turned and made a  quick "this is going to take a teeny  bit longer" gesture to Uncle Roger, then went  back to the call."Tell them to wait and I'll  be right there. ""Por favor, Maria  estoy muy tarde para mi trabajo. ""Sweetie, where are you?I'm right by the front door. "Yvonne stood on tiptoe and scanned the room, looking for a good escape route.The big  arched doorway over to her right looked prom ising."Just tell me which way to go, and  I'll be there quick as a bunny," she told the guy.He let out a furious burst of idiomatic Spanish and hung up, hard."Thanks, honey, I'll be right there!"she caroled, and snapped the phone shut."Gotta run,"  she told Uncle Roger, and took off through the crowd.* * *  She should have known, Yvonne reflected bitterly.God knows Callie had e mailed her  enough pictures while the wedding was in its  planning stages.Trouble was, she'd never  been able to get the attachments to open.Th  ey were bin hexed, or something like that.Probably a virus.But even without seeing the pictures, it should  have occurred to her that if anyone in the  world were capable of picking out non sucky  bridesmaids' dresses, it was Callie.And so  she'd discovered, when she'd arrived at the  church and gotten a glimpse of them.They  weren't sucky at all.Not the problem."Oh lord," she'd said out loud."It's pr      actically the same dress    and hat!"She'd had just enough time to dash back to    her car to grab a lightweight shawl she'd  providentially left lying on the back seat tw o weeks earlier, then come back and find an  out of the way seat at the rear of the  church.During the ceremony, who'd be looking at  her anyway?But that wasn't going to work during the r eception.At close range the shawl just looked  tatty, and when she was standing up it did not hing to camouflage the rest of her gown so  distinctive, with its subtly off shade organza overdress that looked like absolutely  nothing else being worn at the party          except by the bridesmaids, of course.Sometimes, life is just not fair.* * *  A few minutes later, Yvonne found what sh  e needed: An out of the way dressing area  with a good mirror, in the pool house way over  on the other side of the grounds.It wasn't exactly private, but it was around three corners from the poolhouse entrance, and the pool  house itself was reassuringly dark inside.Besi des, with all the guests still up at the main  house doing their initial meet greet and congratulate, she had the place to herself.She switched on the overhead lights directly above the mirror and took a long  hard look at her dress.Would the organ  za come off without leaving the underdress in  rags?It seemed a shame to remove it  she'd   loved this dress  but consoled herself with  the thought that if six other women in their social circle had the exact same thing hanging  in their closets, she'd never have been able to wear it anyway.Yvonne unzipped the dress to her waist,  and took down her bodice so she could  look at its construction.She was in luck!There, underneath the facing, was a neat little  row of hand set stitches fastening the overdre ss to the underlying material.It must have  been designed to be removable all along.Sh e rummaged in her purse for the ornate little  silver pocketknife she'd inherited from he   r grandmother, then went to work ripping  stitches.The front came away easily, and the back was nearly as quick.That left the waist.She looked around, sighed, shrugged, and              peeled her dress off entirely.When she was done, she bundled up the remains and put her dress back on to see  what she had."Less dress; that's for sure," sh e said aloud to the mirror.It was still pretty,  but now it showed far more skin; and with the organza draping gone, she'd had to forego  her bra and its attached slip.She shimmied her shoulders experimentally and watched the  effect.She didn't                        quite            fall out.The matching organza sunhat would have  to go as well.Before, it had matched  the dress perfectly.Now all it matched was the oddly forlorn looking roll of fabric she'd tucked safely away on a high shelf.Yvonne   started carefully removing the hatpins that  had secured the hat to her elaborate hairdo.The minute the hat was off, her glossy  red hair came tumbling down around her  back and shoulders.Yvonne sighed in exasperation.In this humidity, she could see it was  already starting to curl.She twisted the unrul y red hank into a loose knot at the nape of  her neck, tying it off with the hatband and cl  uster of silk flowers from her castoff hat."Very nice," a male voice said lazily from  somewhere behind her."It says a lot  for a dress that I don't mind seeing you put it back on. "Yvonne gasped and whirled around, looking  for the source of the voice while she  groped behind her for her long hatpins."Who "         "Sorry," said the voice.There was the  ratcheting click of a Zippo lighter, and in  the brief flare of its light she saw an older man in formal wear sitting in an ornate high   backed wicker armchair.Then the lighter     clicked shut, and all she could see in the  shadows was the red glow at the end of his cigarillo."How long have you   " she began, then        stopped."I'd have heard you come in. ""I'm afraid so," he said."I'll have to beg your pardon.I had just finished making a  phone call when you walked in. ""In the               dark              ?"she said."Not too dark to make a phone call.You're blinded by those overheads. "Inside her head, an inane little voice was busily calculating  I had the slip on when I took  the dress off, I put the dress back on over the slip, I pulled the slip off over my head while  I still had the dress on, he didn't see much     Another voice was saying formal wear, he's  either a guest or he's an employee who has so mething to lose, still not safe but maybe I'll be okay, keep him talking, where's my knife where's my phone        And something that  wasn't exactly a voice was thinking something like                       Mmmmmm?"I expect you're right. "She walked over to the switch plate and turned on the rest  of the room lights.The mysterious man in the chair now  looked less mysterious, but perhaps more  intriguing: wide shoulders, narrow wais t, a ruddy complexion; not young, but neither  afraid of nor defeated by his age.He looked, she suddenly thought, like a man who was  lightly sparring with his age, and enjoyi ng the fight.His suit was perfectly tailored.He  never rented that suit   , she thought;   not with his build    .She approved of both.The man returned her attention, studying her as she did him.He looked pleased.Yvonne felt herself blushing, and the vexations and frantic pace of the day evaporating as  though they'd never happened.She was in her thirties, her girlhood long behind her, and  she'd never lacked for male companionship;  but she suddenly felt that little pleasurable  dizziness of the dance beginning again, as always feeling like it was the first time in the  history of the world.The nice thing about being in your thirties,      she reflected,  is that you can  appreciate that feeling for what it's     worth, and not worry about what it isn't.Then memory kicked in."Richard Isaacs," she said."I've met you.One of Bruce  Lucent's parties. "His smile widened."Yvonne," he said."I   didn't catch the rest of your name.It  was noisy.You were wearing green silk,   the exact shade of the philodendron hanging  behind you. "She laughed then, feeling absurdly  flattered, and walked across the room  to offer him her hand."How do you do?"she      said."I'm pleased to finally make your acquaintance. "He took her hand and held it lightly in hi  s own for a few seconds."I'm afraid I  really am going to have to ask for your forgiveness," he said."I should have said  something when you came in, but I didn't, and  after that I was fascinated.I had no idea  that women were capable of transformation on such short notice. ""You mean my dress?I had to.I was ambushed. ""What kind of ambush makes  you take your dress apart?"As Yvonne walked back to the narrow shel f in front of the mirror to collect her  bits of belongings and stow them back her   purse, she said, "I cleverly deduce that you  weren't at the wedding ceremony. ""You are correct.What did I miss?""Bridesmaids.Six of them.Every one of  them wearing that same dress and hat. "His jaw dropped."My god.Isn't there some kind of law against that?Bridesmaids  aren't supposed to dress like human beings. ""You'd think, wouldn't you?"Yvonne sai      d."But Callie picked them out. "He shook his head; and then a thought struck him, and he began to laugh.Yvonne watched, feeling a little wary."Share?"she asked."I was just thinking that you're being terri bly brave.My first wife once wore the  same dress worn by just  one other woman at a party, and she sulked about it for a week  and a half.If she'd arrived to find           six  other women wearing her dress "         "Spontaneous human combustion," Yvonne said solemnly."I'd always wondered  what caused it. "Then a brief silence fell between them, and she found herself  wondering self consciously whether she was keeping him from the party.Just as she was wondering whether she should say something about it, he said, "This is lovely, and so are  you  but should I ask whether I'm keeping you from the party?""Oh!"she said, at once relieved and afra id she looked too relieved."I was about  to ask you the same.I have no obligations, besides attending; and if I know Bruce and  Callie, this party will run through tomorrow morning.How about you?""I'm   here   for  the party.I do have one other item on my agenda , which is to try to have a conversation  with a former business associate of one of my former business associates."He grimaced."A man named Roger.I don't know his last name.I'm supposed to recognize him from an  old snapshot they found in the files. ""If it's the Uncle Roger I met as soon as I came in the door, you're too late. ""He's left already?""He's three sheets to the wind.That was   the other reason I came back here and  started hacking my dress apart. "Richard studied her bare shoulders."And        this is supposed to discourage him?""It's supposed to put a crimp in any furt  her rounds of 'Hey, sweetheart, didn't I  meet you at the rehearsal dinner. ""Ah," he said."Now I understand.You      took off your uniform and buried it. ""Exactly.I'm a noncombatant.Now, shall I take a look at this snapshot of yours?I  think I'd recognize him if I saw him. "Richard shook his head."I left it behind. "He picked up a cane she hadn't noticed  he was carrying, and got up out of his chair.He was moving a little stiffly."I                don't  remember that from the party,"            Yvonne said."When were you hurt?""An auto accident.Nothing worth mentioning.I'll get over it; I just haven't yet.He limped over to what Yvonne had taken for  a section of wall."Could you turn out the  lights?There now.Good.This is a louvered  window.You can see most of the yard from  here.Tell me if you spot Uncle Roger. "Richard started turning the crank that would open the louvers, and Yvonne came  and stood beside him.She abruptly reali zed she was close enough to smell him  a good  smell, hard work and clean skin and a hint   of Old Spice  and to feel the slight radiant  warmth of his body, there in the darkness.There was a single sharp knock in her chest, as  though her sternum had been kicked from the   inside, and for a moment she closed her  eyes and fought to keep her balance.Her heart was hammering so hard that she thought  he must surely be able to hear it."There," he said, and she blinked; a nd shook her head a little, trying to clear it.Outside the louvered window, the late afte  rnoon was turning into early evening.
