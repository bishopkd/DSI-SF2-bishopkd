Id prefer not to get your blood all over my ship.So would I, I think, but this could be it.He could be taking me away to my execution, despite what he promised Miranda.I lash out at the man on my right with my leg and catch him on the inner thigh.Then I turn and grab for the rifle of the man on my left.If I can get to the trigger I can  My head.Pain.Swimming.I reach for thoughts, and something dark is wrapped around my head and Im moving, feet banging against the ground.As my senses start to come back, I realize Im being dragged down stairs, deeper into the ship.My body wont respond except to tell me about the pain in my ribs, and in my feet, and most of all in my head.Then were through a door and I smell the ocean and fuel and metal, and Im suddenly splashing through a cold so deep that my heart seems to skip in my chest.Then Im dropped into the cold, freezing, smelly water, and I suck in breath and start to shiver.Someone grabs my hand, and something hard is clapped around my wrist.Then another something on the other wrist.Im shivering and spitting and sniffling as the shroud is removed from my head.Im deep in the hold of the ship.Mal covers a solar powered light that I squint against.Im waist deep in oily, dark water, and each of my hands is cuffed to a pipe.What the fuck?I say through chattering teeth.Mal looks down on me.On the outside he looks as calm and collected as ever, but I can almost see something nasty surging underneath his demeanor.I realize Ive learned to look for those signshe may be charming and civilized, but like a snake he can strike at any time.Or at least thats what I expect from him.Benjamin, Benjamin...Mal shakes his head.I had such dreams for you.So many ways I thought of to revenge myself on you.Elaborate productions, simple, visceral thrills.I wanted it to be ...epic.Or at least poetic.But ...it seems the world has seen fit to choose for me.I go cold.What do you mean?He screws up his face as if he just swallowed something rotten.The Phoenix.Shes experienced ...a mechanical failure.For a moment, a brief flame of hope kindles in my mind.Mals warship has a problem.What kind of mechanical failure?I ask.He slams a hand on one of the metal pipes.These ships ...they naturally take on water.Its something that surprised me when I learned about it.Every minute, every day, some water leaks into them.There are pumps, down below, that pump out the water, keep it at a manageable level.That sounds like a lot of work, I say.It is.This ship is ...a lot of work.If not for the fact that many of the tasks are automated, I dont know that we would have gotten her moving.I have some people who know computer systems.We have this thing hacked and rigged more than a junker.What does this have to do with the pumps?I try to keep my voice level, but its not going well.I keep pulling on the cuffs, a reaction to the cold water, and thats causing them to dig into my wrists.The computer systems are the easy part, comparatively.The Phoenix has some hull damage.Some of it exacerbated by a deficiency in our navigation skills.We lack the ability to haul her out of the water to fix it.The pumps have more to do and now ...some of them have ceased working.Thats your mechanical failure?Yes.He bites the word.Youre taking on water.His pained expression answers for him.And this is ...what?An illustration of that fact?He smiles, ever so briefly.My people and I are going to have to evacuate.After years of preparation, we will abandon this ...ark.The smile returns.We will, but you wont.What?Youre staying right here.Mal...Its not what I would have wanted, but in a way its fitting, he says.And I think it qualifies as poetic.You cant leave me here, I say.His face goes hard, and I can see that his disappointment at this unexpected failure saturates his whole being.Hes defeated by chance, and he doesnt take defeat well.If I push him too much, he might just kill me here.That might be a mercy, I think.Actually, Benjamin, I can leave you here.I can do it easily.And, though this loss pains me in so many ways, this one little piece will give me satisfaction.Beyond measuring.What about your promise to Miranda?I promised her that I would leave you alive until the ship reaches its destination.I am fulfilling that promise.I just didnt expect the final destination to be the bottom of the ocean.Mal...Good bye, Benjamin, he says.He takes a moment to stare at me, savoring the moment.Possibly the last time he, or anyone else, will see me.Think, Ben, think.But all I see is Miranda.Youll get Miranda off?He is silent for a moment.Then he says, Yes, of course.She hasnt wronged me.Shell be safe.He starts walking toward the stairs, his men flanking him.I nod.Its a shot of relief in a big bottle of shit.A bright spot.Just like Mals bright spot in the shit of him losing his boathe gets to dispose of me in a very fitting way.Even I can see it has a kind of symmetry to it.But what if the ship werent sinking?Wait, I say.You said your pumps were failing.I assume you tried to fix them?Of course, he says, pausing at the bottom of the stairs.Then you need replacements.He sneers at me.We dont have any.Are you looking?His eyes narrow.What do you take me for, Benjamin?Im a forager.Of course Im looking.But Im not hopeful.We did this kind of search before.Most of what we found was below the water, and we had no way of getting to them.What if you could?Good bye, Benjamin, he says.Then he and his men walk up the stairs, closing the heavy metal doors behind them.Im left in the dark.In the cold water.The smell of it is thick around me.The ship creaks, and I wonder if Ill go insane before the water gets too high.Or maybe Ill freeze.This is not how you end, Ben.You have to get out of here.But how?Think, Ben, think.He needs pumps.Cant find them.But there must be more out there.Somewhere.Who would know?Other foragers?Too risky, and foragers dont share information easily.Information.It touches off something in my mind.A thought bubbles up.Someone who deals primarily in information.Lord Tess.But surely Mal thought about her already?I call out into the darkness.Mal!Mal!No response except the sloshing of water around me.The creaking of the ship.Mal, I think I can help you!Nothing.Could he even hear me through the ship?It could work.It might save the ship.And that might save me.At least buy me some time before I go down.Mal!I scream as loud as I can.My throat hurts with the effort.Everything hurts.I try to work the cuffs, but theyre on tight and the pipes theyre connected to are steady.I gather my breath for one last scream.Its hard with the cold all around me.Mal!I know where you can The door opens.I see a light at the top of the stairs.Mal descends.What are you talking about, Benjamin?he asks.I know how you can get your pumps, I say.My voice sounds raw.You need a knowledge broker.I take a breath.Lord Tess.His face turns sour.No, he says.No?She and I had a ...falling out.What kind of falling out?I ask.I hurt someone she cared about.At my questioning look, he adds, I didnt have much of a choice.He shakes his head.No, she wont help me.Then let her help me, I say.You?Let me go in your place.She likes me.Say what you will, but Lord Tess always had a soft spot for me.I can use that to get her to help you.Hes silent for a moment.You know shes the best knowledge broker around.You know that she can get you what you need.And you know where to find her?She hasnt moved in the last few years.I know where she is.No one touches her because shes too valuable.And you really think that you can get her to help.I smile at him.Through the shivering, it feels more like a grimace.I know I can.He snorts and shakes his head.If you think Im going to trust you, you sustained more damage in that fall than was obvious.Of course not, I say.But you need me.And you need me right now.What I need are new pumps.I can get them.He shakes his head.Ill have to think about it.Then think fast.He looks me up and down.Benjamin, how did you come to be in the ocean in a life raft with the wreckage of the Cherub all around you?I frown.I thought Miranda explained it to you.I want to hear you say it.I consider my words very carefully.I took on some raiders.Out of Gastown.The Cherub didnt survive.A wave of nausea hits me, though Im not sure if its from thinking of the Cherub or from my current predicament.They attacked you?Took out the ship?No, I say.I attacked them.I took out their ships.With the Cherub?Yes.Why?I carefully choose the next wordsI cant tell him about Tamoanchan.Not Mal.Not now.I cant tell him that I was trying to save a whole island of strangers, and a few friends who were on it.Instead I just say, They were after some friends of mine.He raises a thick, dark eyebrow.You gave up your airship, your beloved Cherub, for your friends?Incredulity drips from his words.Things change, I say.He narrows his eyes, chewing on it.Well see, he says.Then he leaves.I have no way of telling time down here in the bowels of the ship.I shiver and soak up the water.My muscles ache.My jaw, too, from the chattering.I think a lot about Miranda.The last time I was in freezing water was after we jumped out of the Cherub.She was floating in my inflatable raft.I fell into the water.I thought I was going to die then, but I didnt.She was the reason I clawed my way to the raft.Shes been my light in the darkness so many times before.I could use that right now.Then, after some time, Mal returns with his thugs in tow.Ive considered your proposal, he says.And?Ive decided that a slim hope is better than no hope at all.And there it is.Mal loves his ship more than he hates me.Thinking back on everything, he must really love his ship.So youll let me go?There are conditions, he says.Okay...You will leave this ship with a crew of my people who will take you to Lord Tess.If and when you get what you need from her, they will take you to whatever your destination is.Try to run or pull something, and they will kill you quickly and without mercy, understood?Okay, I say.Its not the best arrangementbut it gets me out of this cell and into the air.And it gives me a chance.And what happens when I get back?Pardon me?If I get you your pumps, and they work, and your ship is saved ...Im not going back into a cell.If Im just going to end up the same way, why should I bother?His eyes narrow and the slightest hint of a smile touches his lips.You will bother because if you do not, I will let your friend, Miranda, die.My mouth drops open.Whatever I had been expecting, it hadnt been that.You wouldnt, I say.Wouldnt I?Youre not a killer.That trace of a smile vanishes from his face.Its been a long time, Benjamin.You dont know what I am.You said you had no issues with her.She didnt wrong youI did.He inclines his head.True, but then you went and convinced me that you could get me my pumps.Im not setting you free.Not now.So to motivate you I needed to find something else.Mal...I know you, Benjamin.You are slippery, and untrustworthy, and far from dependable.So I must take ...drastic measures.You dont have to do this.He ignores the comment.Miranda will take your place.Right here.If the ship goes down before your return, then so does Miranda.For a moment, desperation fills me and I try to move forward, pulling at the cuffs.Mal doesnt even blink.Mal wades forward, his face close to mine.You dont know what Im capable of, Benjamin.Not anymore.Fail to return, or take too much time, and Miranda will sink with this ship.Those are my terms.I only then realize that my hands are curled into fists, the nails pressing against my palms.Then I have a condition.Anger touches his eyes.You dont get to make conditions.I insist on this one, I say, biting the words.You put Miranda into this.Then I want to make sure that shes okay.I want to see her.If youre going to use her like this, I need to see her.He tilts his head, considering.Then he nods.Very well.You may see her.Just to confirm that shes safe.But otherwise you must leave immediately.I try to think of a way around this.No matter what, one of us dies.Her if I fail.Me if I succeed.She would have survived, too, if I didnt try to convince Mal.But, what if there are other possibilities?Maybe I can slip Mals people, get free, come back to get Miranda.Or maybe you get yourself killed and you both die, the voice in my head says.Too late now, I think.And it is.Mal now has a chance.With me.And he will hold me to it.Take me to Miranda, I say.Miranda starts saying my name when she sees me, but it gets lost in this rush of blood in my head, and before I know it Im moving forward and pulling her close to me and holding her tight.The scent of her hair fills my head and some tension in me uncoils and some hope for the future returns.She holds me back, her arms tight before she pulls away.Youre cold and wet, she says.Long story, I say.Im glad to be out of the water and not freezing, but I feel like shit.Let me look at you, she says.She pulls back my shirt and inspects the bullet wound from however many days ago.Then she feels my forehead and then my wrist, quickly finding my pulse.Well, your wound seems okay.I did a good job patching you up.Yeah, I say.Thank you for that.And she did.I mean I still feel some painhell, I was shot and stabbed and all thatbut Im feeling a lot better.Aside from the freezing and the head blow.I think you should hire me to protect you, Miranda says with a smile.I think you might be right.I spend a moment to take her in.Her dark, wavy hair is tied back in a loose, messy ponytail, and her glasses still perch on her nose.Good.I was worried she might lose them in the fall from the Cherub.Her light brown skin looks paler than usual, and she looks tired, but otherwise she seems to be in good health.Fed, at least.I lose some time staring into her light brown eyes.She places a calloused hand on my cheek.We dont have a lot of time, I say.Why not?I shake my head.The ship.Its sinking.I know, she says.Well ...I convinced Mal that I could find a way to fix it.What?She looks at me, incredulous.Can you?I think so.How?I have to leave the ship, I say.Go see someone.See if I can find a replacement for his pumps.Youre leaving?One hand is on her hip.The other pushes back a tangle of hair from her face.It was all I could think of, I say.He was going to let me sink with the ship.Miranda exhales noisily and shakes her head.What did you do to him, Ben?Thats not important.Ill tell you all about it later.I put my hands on her shoulders.But you need to knowhes letting me go, but...But what?I hear the edge in her voice, the familiar sound of her realizing that this isnt going to be good for her.Hes using you as leverage.What?Hes going to put you down below.Where the water is coming in.Incentive for me to come back.Quickly.Ben!I know, Im sorry.I never expected that.If I knew thats what he was going to say, I never would have proposed it.But its too late now.He wants to make sure Ill come back, and hell use you to make that happen.Ben...I hear the anger in her voice, and she turns away from me.Ill come back for you, I say.I promise.Im not going to abandon you.Ben Miranda...She turns back to me.Her jaw is set.I know, you plan to come back.To get me.But theres no guarantee that youll be able to do that.And I was working on a way to get you out of here.I told you, Miranda, I didnt expect it to go this way.You never do.Mal wasnt going to let me go.He was going to let me sink with the ship.I know him.He made you a promise, sure, but all he promised to do was to keep me on the ship.He would have done that.Until we both went under.I thought that this way I would have a chance.In return for me.I throw up my hands in frustration.I know.I know.He outmaneuvered me.Mirandas silent.This is the only play I saw that I could make.I know someone.Someone I think can help Mal out.If I can convince her to help, Ill be able to get back here and youll be safe.And at least Ill have bought myself some time.Time to hopefully figure something else out.Who is this someone?Her tone is flat.Clinical.Another person I go way back with.She shakes her head.That doesnt bode well.I can do this, I say.Ill either get help or else Ill figure something out.But no matter what, Im coming back for you.She closes her eyes for a moment.Id like to believe that, Ben.And I know that you want to.But this is a big gamble.It hurts, to be honest.That Miranda doesnt believe in me.Miranda...Ben, she says.Were so close.I have the data from Gastown.I can make some real progress here.And then ...this.Shes talking about data about the Bug that she stole from a lab on Gastown.A group of scientists there were studying it for use as a weapon.Miranda thinks it will help her in her search for a cure.I didnt do this to hurt you, I say.I know, she says.Please believe me, Im not going to let you go down with this ship.I promise you.We both need to make it back to Tamoanchan.I drop my voice low on the name of the island.Its a secret, and I dont want Mals people to find out about it.Tamoanchan is where Miranda and I had been headed when the Cherub went down.Gastown raiders had found out the location of the island and were heading toward it to attack.I managed to take the raiders down, using my airship as a bomb.It stopped the immediate threat, but that doesnt mean that Tamoanchan is okay.The raiders must still have the location of the island.FriendsRosie and Diegowent ahead of us to warn the island, but who knows if they were able to evacuate in time or even where they would go.We have no idea if theyre okay or not.I worry about Sergei and Clay, Miranda says, talking about her colleagues back on Tamoanchan.Theyre also boffins, scientists, out to find a cure for the Bug.We left Sergei and Clay behind a couple of weeks ago now.If the island is in danger, then they are too.Well get back to them, I say.Both of us.Her expression is devoid of any emotion.I hope so.Ill come back, I say.Youll see.She meets my eyes but doesnt say anything.Miranda, I Im interrupted by the reappearance of Mals guards, ready to take me away.Good bye, Ben, Miranda says.I cant bring myself to say it back to her.Mal stands before a table, upon which there are several items of clothing.Your clothes, Mal says.Dried from your immersion in the ocean.I didnt do anything about the stains.I reach for my pantsold, worn denimand shed the pants Im wearing, which are thin and shapeless.Being unclothed in front of Mal and his people is strangeIve only ever really been naked alone, or with Claudia, or, far back, with Dadbut putting on my pants, my old, familiar pants, gives me something back.Makes me feel more like myself.Next he hands me my shirt.Its also worn, but thick, soft, warm.It bears a check pattern that used to be dark but has faded to mostly assorted shades of grey.I shrug it on over the t shirt that Ive been wearing.Your coat, Mal says, didnt fare well during your immersion in the ocean.He holds it up, and I see it warped and peeling like a dying tree.I need a coat, I say.He holds up a hand, placatingly.I know.And though clothing is as valuable as ever, I cant send you out into the world without one.So ...here.He lifts up something long and dark.This should fit you.I take it from him and hold it up.Its different than my previous coat.I worry about its length.I like to keep my legs freeunencumbered.The material isnt leather but something thick.It would be tough to tear through.I guess this is my only choice?I ask.He nods.I put the coat on.Its heavier than my old one, and it falls to my calves.I dont like the feeling of it on my legs.But it fits pretty well and has plenty of pockets to stash ammo or barter in.The collar can be turned up to protect my neck.Good, Mal says.Like thats that.And I guess it is.One last thing, I say.I reach for my old coat and find the Star of David that I had pinned to it.I take it off and pin it instead to my new coat.The pin doesnt penetrate the fabric, but I am able to thread it to one of the fasteners so that it sits over my heart.Mal raises an eyebrow.You were never one for affectations.Things change.He grunts.Then he rummages in a bag and pulls out my fathers revolver.Some things dont.He holds it up by the handle.I couldnt actually believe that you still have this.I narrow my eyes.It has sentimental value.Then immediately regret saying it.If Mal wants to fuck with me, not giving me the revolver would be a good way to do that.Can I have it?Mal screws up his lips.No, he says.Not now.I will give it to your escorts.If its necessary, they will give it to you.However, if you insist on being an irritant or, worse, a problem, then I will instruct them to toss it into the ocean.Are we understood?I nod.Like everything else about this deal, its not as bad as it could be.But its not good.One opportunity will be hard enough to find.More?I just hope his people are lax.I reach down to the coat pockets.Theyre a little lower than my old ones, and a bit deeper.I dont know that they will allow for a good draw.Hold on, I say.I need a holster.Why?Mal asks.You have no gun.I sigh and roll my eyes.No.But if I need to use it, Ill need one.Mal just stares at me.It could be the difference between life and death, I say.And if I die getting you your pumps, then you dont get the pumps.Its not strictly true.But true enough.I see Mal weighing it in his mind.Ill see what I can do, he says.My people will bring you up on deck.He looks down at his hands, splayed out on the table in front of him.Then he meets my eyes again.Good luck, Benjamin.Thanks, I say.Dont take too long.I nod.How long do you think I have?He shrugs.A few days.Three at most.The clock starts ticking.FOUR FROM THE JOURNAL OF MIRANDA MEHRA In my history of studying the Maenad Virus, I dont think its ever confounded me as much as Ben Gold.Maybe because viruses, even considering mutation, tend to act according to understandable principles.Ben Gold ...not so much.That he left me again is not really very surprising.Ben is very good at leaving.Ben likes to run away.No, Ben likes to fly away.That he did it to try to save himself is one of the few things that makes sense with him.Hes spent a large part of his life trying to stay alive.Its a skill that hes honed to a sharp point.Its just that that skill, and really most of his past life, is at odds with what Im trying to do.In the beginning of our association, I had to convince him to carry my blood samples on his ship.He fought and he bucked.Because he was risking his survival.And yet in the end he came around.Or at least I thought he had.But its really only been a few weeks ago since he left me the last time.Where Ben and I differ ...well, I dont have time to go into all of it, but I see the risk as being worth it for something greater.The risk of dealing with infected blood, or transporting a live Feral, is palatable if it brings us closer to a cure.I thought he had come around to that way of thinking, especially when he sacrificed the Cherub to save Tamoanchan.Hell, he almost sacrificed his life to do it.I thought something had changed.I know he didnt plan to put me in dangerBen wouldnt do thatbut he has this tendency to leave chaos in his wake.Bens impulsive.He makes decisions without always thinking them through.Its one of the things that infuriates me about him.Okay, Miranda.Be honest.Its also one of the things that I like about him.I take longer to make up my mind.Many times when he acts, Ill be making lists, weighing the positives and negatives of actions and positions, calculating percentages.Its the kind of thinking that I need to maintain in science.The truth is that we are often better together, when we can balance one another.Which makes it exceedingly frustrating when he goes off on his own.Damn it, Ben.I often think that he likes to play the hero.Dashing off to risk his life, thinking that hes protecting me when all hes doing is preventing me from doing any good.And the good I can do...The data I took from Gastown is still in my pocket.Every moment that passes, I itch to get it back, compare it to our data, share it with Sergei and the others and see where that takes us.I think it might take us a few steps closer to a cure.I hope to everything thats good, that Ill get a chance to use it.I didnt really know what to think about the idea of Malik threatening my life.Since I got here, to the Phoenix, hed been nothing but nice to me.Respectful, even.I know that he has a severe problem with Ben, but hed always treated me well.And yet here he was, threatening to send me down with the ship.I knew I needed to confront him about it and get a sense of what exactly he intended.With Ben gone, and the possibility of him failing, I needed a plan to get myself free of this situation.I wasnt going to let the Gastown data go to waste.It would not go down with me.Luckily for me, we have our dinners.I didnt get a chance to fill Ben in on anything, but I wonder if he would have been surprised to know that Malik had been inviting me to dinner on a regular basis since shortly after picking us up out of the water.During the day, I would work on whatever medical issues needed attendingsetting broken bones or irrigating wounds or just bandaging peopleand in the evenings Malik and I would dine together.It seemed perfectly natural to me, of course.I was the one who convinced Malik to save Ben.I was the one working him.At first we talked about what had happened with the Cherub.Then, my skills as a doctor.But after that ...we just started talking.After seeing Ben, and discovering my new status as a prisoner, I expected that to change.And yet, mere hours after Ben left, Malik himself appeared at the door to my cabin.Is it time to go below?I asked.I stood against the wall of the cabin, my arms crossed.Still mad at Ben.Still mad at the situation.That fucker.No, he said.I came to invite you to dinner.Do you normally dine with prisoners?I asked.I prefer the term honored guest.Maybe we can settle on hostage, I said.He smiled.Will you come to dinner tonight?I thought about it.I thought I should say no, but I needed to figure a way out of this.And I needed more data.Also, his food is spectacular.Its always hard to turn down good food.I nodded.Wonderful.He turned to go.I stopped him before he left.Why do you hate Ben?He waved a hand in the air.Id rather not get into those details at the moment.Maybe another time.At dinner?He smiled at me.Perhaps.I am forced to admit that Maliks dinner arrangements were always impressive.Like always, I was escorted to a private room where he was waiting for me.Just the two of us, a small, intimate table, and lit oil lamps around the room.I think you forgot the food, I said.He smiled.Its being prepared, he said.Please, have a seat.I sat and soon could smell the aroma of the fish and vegetables that were cooking in the nearby galley.My stomach spasmed in anticipation.Malik ate better than anyone I had ever met.That was one of the reasons I kept accepting his invitations.Then Malik opened a bottle of wine.Ive always preferred the stronger spirits, but when I tasted it, I had to admit it was goodsmooth, silky, and yet still having an almost fruity flavor.The conversation turned to me.My background.I started giving him my scientific background before realizing he was asking about something differentethnicity.Why do you want to know?I asked.He shrugged.It doesnt matter, of course.Why would it?Its just that you defy easy categorization.I chose to take it as a compliment.Some people still cling to the importance of ethnicities, but most people couldnt give a damn.What does it matter if your ancestors were English if there was no England anymore?The concern mostly came from zealots and fanatics.I wouldnt have even answered if I didnt think it was an intellectual question.Malik seemed the kind of person who would know aspects of history and nationality.I decided to answer.Im a mix, I said.If I were an airship, Id be a junker.A little of this, something of that.The way I was told, Ive got some Indian, Brazilian, Irish, and French.Thats a lot for the Sick, he said.Youve obviously never been on a science commune, I said.Theres a certain comfort in the fact that everyone understands disease transmission.Romantic attachments are loose and fluid.And you?My mothers people were Muslims, he said.She was raised in the faith.She used to pray to the east several times a day.But you werent raised that way?Things were ...more difficult when I was a child.Partly because of me.I think it became less important.He sipped his wine.Or rather survival became more important.He looked down at his glass, rotated it between his fingers.I thought I saw a dark cloud come over his face for just a moment.Then he covered it with a smile, looking up at me.How did you lose her?I asked.I was being manipulative, pushing on the sensitivity he had just shown, but I needed to gain some ground with him.His face grew tight.He drank a long sip of his wine, then he finally met my eyes.I dont like to talk about it, he said.Suffice it to say that she sacrificed herself to save me.I was old enough to start looking out for myself.But only barely.That must have been hard, I said, holding his gaze.He smiled.It forced me to learn quickly.I learned how to make friends, how to convince people to help me.The smile vanished.And I learned ...other things.My parents both died when I was young, I said, scrambling to cover the gap that seemed to be opening up between us.I only remember fragments of them.My father, his brown hands bent around a microscope.My mother, taking me up in a balloon, a smile on her face.That must have been difficult, Malik said.Having them both taken from you at a young age.I nodded.It was.But I had Sergei.Sergei?he asked.I smiled.He was a friend of my parents.A student of my fathers.He took me in when they died.I felt warmth in my chest, thinking about Sergei.I miss him so much.I hope hes okay.Sergei took care of me.Malik raised his glass.To Sergei.What could I do but raise mine?To Sergei.I felt tears collect in my eyes, but I pushed them away.I wasnt going to show weakness in front of Malik.But I missed Sergei and last I knew, Gastown ships were headed for Tamoanchan, the island where he was.Where Id left him.When we blew up the Cherub, we took out those ships, but what if there were more?Are you okay?Malik had asked.Yes, I said, sipping at my wine.I was just thinking of ...old times.Malik narrowed his eyes and stared at me.What?I asked.I know you told me about you and Benjamin.That you hired him to protect you, but ...why him?Ah, I thought.Here it is.Whatever was between them had sparked this question.I smiled at him.Ill tell you.But in return you have to tell me why you hate him.He regarded me for a long moment.Are you sure you really want to know?Yes, I said, without hesitation.He nodded.Okay, then.So I told him about how I had been researching Ferals, taking blood samples to study Maenad back with Sergei and the others.I told him how on one of those excursions, in Old Monterey, I had been abandoned by the ship captain Id hired to take me.I told him how Ben had found me and saved me from Ferals.He seemed to know what he was doing, so I hired him, I said.I think at first the lure of food and fuel was enough to keep him interested.And now?Malik asked.For some reason, when he asked that, I thought about the kiss.As Ben prepared to throw us out of the Cherub, as we wondered if we were about to plummet to our deaths, he grabbed me and kissed me.I kissed him back.It was a good kiss.Probably an 8 or a 9 out of 10.It was a very good kiss.I think Bens changed, I said.He believes in more than himself.Malik smirked.I dont believe that someone like Benjamin can change.Everything changes, I say.Its a fundamental fact of nature.Malik tilted his head in agreement.And yet the bacterium changes in but a few moments.The stone, the mountain ...a lifetime.I think Benjamin is of the latter kind.It was a good point.I had to give him that.What did he do to you?I asked.And so he told me.I still wish I hadnt asked.My efforts with Malik were blunted by his story about Ben.I am still digesting it.Trying to reconcile it with what I know of the man whom Ive spent most of the past few months with.Do I really know him?Has he really changed?And now, of course, Im frustrated by my lack of effect.Any moment now, Maliks people are going to show up to escort me into the bowels of the ship.This was my chance to find my way out and I failed.What can I do, trapped below?For better or worse (and it feels very worse), my fate seems tied up in Ben.And I have to hope that he does what he says he can.I dont feel very confident.I can hear them at the door.My time is running out.Ben ...please come through.FIVE To be honest, I never thought I would be so unhappy to be back in the sky.I love being in the air, its where I belong, but, well, not like this.I know, I knowmy dad used to say something about beggars not being choosers, but Im aboard a strange ship, and I cant fly her or even navigate, and I feel powerless.The ship is called the Raven and her captain is a zep named Whistler.Whistler was probably born a woman, based on bone structure, but now eschews gender altogether.Its not uncommon in the Sick where sex is a potentially deadly prospect.Or, who knowsmaybe Whistler was just born that way.Thats not my problem with Whistler.My problem with Whistler is that Whistler has been in my face since this whole thing started.Seems that Mal wasnt exaggerating when he said his people would be on top of me the whole time.Whistler wears a lot of leather, which adds to the hard image.A metal cuff, lots of piercings, and big, black boots complete the picture.Hair, short and dark, sits messily on Whistlers head.The perpetual scowl, I think, is mostly in response to me, but who really knows?I give them Lord Tesss location, the San Francisco Public Library, hoping that doing so wont piss Tess off, but how else am I going to get there?Chang, Whistlers second in command, a rough looking fellow with a shaved, scarred head and a wispy mustache, lays in the course.When did both of you hook up with Mal?I ask.Fuck you, scavenger, Whistler says.Ship captains these days have no manners.Take us in from the south, Whistler tells Chang.Weve seen ships flying the route to the north.What kind of ships?I ask.Shut up, Whistler says.This is going to be a delightful trip.If this is a trap, Whistler says, just know that the first thing Im going to do is put a bullet in the back of your head.Whistler carries a large handgun strapped to one leg.One shot from that would leave tiny pieces of my skull and its contents all over the place.Its not a trap, I say.Lord Tess is a knowledge broker.Shes open to anyone.Shes valuable enough that people leave her alone.Its best to just let the information flow.Truth be told, I hope thats still the case.I thought I knew how the world worked, and then everything went upside down on me.Gastown, the big city in the sky, was supposed to be the start of a new era, the seed of a new society.That had been enough to make it untouchable until raiders out of Valhalla, a sky city back east, took it over.I thought all they wanted were the resources, and the helium the city in the sky had, but when I looked a little closer, seems they were working with a group of scientists I call the Cabal, who were experimenting with the Bug.Everythings different now, everythings crazy.Since the people on board hate me, I focus my attention on the ship.The Raven is longer than the Cherub was, thinner, but the Cherub was sleek, smooth, like a wide, slightly flattened bullet.The Raven is somehow blockier and gives the appearance of awkwardness.Still, we appear to be moving at a decent clip.Shes also armed, which is something I never really went in for.But Mals people do.He always thought that it mattered.The two gunners on board dont like me either.Inside, the Ravens pretty spareWhistler commands from the rear of the gondola with a good view of the ships surroundings through the windows that ring it.Its mostly gray metal, with a few reinforced panels bolted onto it.Chang sits in front of the controls closer to the front of the gondola.Some kind of personal objecta bit of netting with some crystals or jewelry attached to ithangs from the right arm of his seat.I think about asking him what it is but then dont.Id probably get another fuck you or fuck off or die, you fuck.Did Mal tell you all to hate my guts?I ask.No, Whistler said, we did that all on our own.I dont get as much lip from Chase and Orkney, the other two members of the crew, but thats mostly because theyre off manning the large guns, one on each side of the Ravens shell.I had entertained brief thoughts of overpowering the crew.Taking control of the ship and forming a plan to rescue Miranda, but I would only chance it if I knew I could succeed.And even though there are only two people here with me, one of whom is flying the Raven, I still cant chance it.Mirandas life is at stake.So I wait.You said its a library, Whistler says.Yes, I say.Thats a place where they used to keep books.The stare that Whistler gives me deserves its own caliber.So this woman has access to all of these books.Yes.Then why do people need her at all?Why not take the library and the books as well?I sigh.Its not about the books.Even if you can read, do you know where to find what youre looking for?Do you want to read through book after book to find it?Whistlers face contorts into a sour expression.Thats what Lord Tess offers.She will get you the information.Sometimes by checking a book.Sometimes by trading information someone traded her.I think she even has some working computers in the place.But what she offers isnt the books.Its the service.And youre sure she can get us those pumps?Yes, I lie.I dont know for certain.This might be something Tess cant do, but Ive risked it all on this one shot.And unlike Mal and me, or Mal and Tess, Tess and I have good history.I think shell do what she can to help.You better hope youre right, Whistler says.Chang nods, silently.Ive been thinking the same thing.So ...Hawaii, I say.Whistler glares at me in response.You going to become, what, farmers?Live off the land?No response.Sorry, but you guys dont seem like the type.Mal said he wasnt very smart, Whistler says.I get the feeling its directed at Chang.Sorry, I say.But were zeps.Are you really going to be happy down on the ground like a plod?Giving up the sky?Whistler turns to face me.The sky aint what it used to be.One hand clenches into a fist.Do you know what the lifespan is for the average zep?All of us are past it.Living on borrowed time.Flying from one dangerous situation to another.Risking our lives again and again.What Malik has given us is a better chance.A chance to find our own place.In a paradise with good weather and the chance to grow our own food and maybe die of old age instead of in a firefight, or getting clipped by a Feral or because the ship loses an engine.I can only swallow in response.Im not naive enough to think that its going to be easy, Whistler says.But I am willing to give it a chance.Why wouldnt I be?That shuts me up for a while.The San Francisco Public Library is a pretty boxy building.Im sure it looked nice back in the Clean, but its stained and worn, and all the glass has been boarded up now.Two guards stand outside, in a metal cage, armed with rifles.The cage protects them from Ferals, and also keeps us out.Us, in this case, is me, Whistler, and Orkney.Whistler tasked the knobby, bald gunner to be one of my escorts and insisted on coming with me.They were afraid Tess would shelter me.I cant say the thought hadnt occurred to me, but here we are.We stand outside the cage, out in the open, on the ground, as the Raven circles above us.In the rain.Were here to see Lord Tess, I say, wiping wet hair from my face.Im an old friend.The guards dont talk much, but they let us into the cage, one operating the door, the other ready to unload if necessary.Once were in, we hand over our weapons (and get patted down just in case).Then they secure the cage and open the doors to the library proper.No tricks, Whistler hisses in my ear as we enter.I can still put you down, even without my gun.Just let me do the talking, then, I say.We go way back, but she doesnt know you two from Feral shit.It strikes me as were walking from the hallway into the library that we are extremely vulnerable.If Tess werent here, for example, this would be a great way to strip visitors of weapons and then use them for whatever nefarious purpose you wanted.I dont know for sure that shes hereonly that she was here last time.Easy, Ben, I think.Dont get paranoid.The place is dark, with plenty of side corridors for attackers to hide in.Our steps echo off of the ground, which is remarkably well preserved.Its old, and musty, but cleaner than most old buildings Ive been through.I wonder how much blood this floor has seen.As we move down the hallway, steps begin echoing toward us from the opposite direction.Attendants?I dont remember them from last time, but maybe the operation has grown.My blood chills when I see whos approaching.Two people, one tall, one of medium height.The tall one is a woman with a large nose and a square jaw.Her companion is clean shaven, with pock marked cheeks and a pale complexion.She wears a shirt made of metal links, and on top of that is a kind of scarf or shawl that seems assembled from feathers.Maybe vulture or eagle feathersblack and long.Her head is shaved except for the very top, and the hair is pulled into a long tail held in place with metal rings.Her companion wears a fur vest on top of a loose shirt, but I can see the muscles bunch beneath it.A long scar on the top of his head divides his short hair into two parts.Hes wearing a necklace, too, and I think its teeth strung together.Some long and pointed.Others, short and blunt.Like human teeth.My blood chills because their appearances mark them as being from Valhalla, the floating city in the east.For a long time, Valhalla was the only city in the sky, and then Gastown was created.Gastown was a free city, a city of trade, a city trying to bring civilization back, lift it off of the ground and into the sky.It was also a city that had access to helium.Then the Valhallan raiders attacked and took it over.Turned it into a fiefdom of Valhalla.Used it to launch raids and attacks.Used the helium to lift their own ships, and bartered what was left for exorbitant prices.It was Valhallan raiders who attacked Mirandas last headquarters, the Core, and killed some of her people.It was Valhallan raiders who stole the Cherub.It was Valhallan raiders who were on their way to attack Tamoanchan.My hand reaches down to my holster for my revolver, but ...its not there.Were fucked, I think.Theyve taken over Tesss operation as well.I tense, getting ready to do ...I dont know.Something.Anything.I put out a hand to halt Whistler and Orkney.We stop.The Valhallans approach, their eyes flicking over us, their faces blank.Take out the woman first, I think.Hope the others take the man, then run back to the cage with any weapons we can strip.Im formulating this plan, and then...The raiders pass us by.They dont pause.They dont stop.Were less than buzzing flies for all the attention they pay to us.What was that?Whistler hisses.My pulse returns to normal.The energy bleeds out of me.Nothing, I say.Never mind.I continue on, and then were there, in the audience chamber in the San Francisco Public Library.Lord Tess was old the first time I met her, so shes positively ancient now.Shes also remarkably well preserved, especially in a world where the average life expectancy is something you can count on your fingers and toes.The story goes that she actually remembers the Clean, or at least had a parent who lived in it and so knows more about it than most people.Looking at her, I can believe it.Her face is pale and a mess of wrinkles.She keeps her hair short and doesnt wear a scarf or anything on her face aside from the large, dark glasses that cover her eyes.She wears a dark sweater that covers her neck and some kind of shawl around that.Her pants are thick and loose, and she wears thick slippers on her feet.She sits in a large, comfortable looking throne, draped all over with blankets and old rugs.Books stand in tottering, old piles around her.The throne sits in a large, open space in the library.
