Please respond.She flicked the switch back.We have to wait, Captain.There is a delay because the signal channel is sent out in six parts and refracted off detectable gravitational fields.Hopefully the signal will only fully reconfigure at the destination.A few minutes went by with nothing but silence from the external com.The com started hissing.Out Drifter, this is General Khar of the Moros Gamma.Were glad to hear the good news  Hello, General Khar.We need a way to pass the alien fleet, said Sara.Its going to be difficult, Out Drifter.We are reluctant to shut down our EPHX cannonsThe aliens have been bombarding the cannons with missiles for weeks.They know the cannons lenses are deteriorating  You have to shut them down for us; otherwise we cant get to the surface and make the delivery you need.We understand, but the only option we have is to use what remains of our fighter fleet to attack the aliens as we open a way for your ship to approach.If we dont provide a distraction the aliens will follow you down to the surface and wipe us out.We need about two hours to prepare our fleet for battle  We are less than an hour away at interstellar speed, said Sara.Well wait for your signal to approach.We are running a gauntlet here, General; there is a chance we wont make it.I plan to come out of interstellar speed just short of the atmosphere; then I will make the dash for the surface.How many ships are in the alien blockade?The aliens have approximately eight hundred fighters, twenty four smaller cruisers and two main battleships  Sara drew a deep breath and put the palm of her hand to her forehead.She closed her eyes and waited a few moments before speaking again.How many ships do you have?We have thirty four fighters, and we have adapted fifteen standard transport cruisers into battle worthy ships  She shook her head and her eyes filled with apprehension.General, do you really think you can create a distraction with so few ships?Its our only chance he answered.Sara didnt say a word for a few seconds.She simply stared at the console without blinking.Michael knew her mind was racing through all the possibilities.Well wait for your signal to approach and provide you with our approximate arrival time through this secure channel.She switched the external com to standby and lowered her head.A moment later she laughed.Whats so funny?he asked.If I wasnt laughing I would be crying.Im going to buy myself a present if I manage to get through this alien blockade.I know you can do this, Sara.That makes one of us, she said, laughing again.Captain, this is complete madness.I expected a blockade of about one hundred alien fighters, not eight hundred.I hoped to find a gap and run for it, but eight hundred alien fighters!There wont be any gaps in the blockade.We will have to fight the aliens no matter what I do, and thats just getting to the surface.Getting away from Moros Gamma will be nearly impossible.Sara, we have come this far.We can make it.Captain, why are you always so confident?You never worry about anything.Fearing the future doesnt make the future any better.I believe we can do anything if its in the realm of possibility, and getting to Moros Gamma is in the realm of possibility.She leaned back in her seat.My people believed they could hold back the alien invasion of Gazar Prime, but their belief didnt stop the aliens destroying my home world; no amount of confidence could halt the destruction.I understand about being positive, but some things are just impossible.Its a matter of being realistic.A realistic person would never attempt to break through this blockade.What about hope?Hope is a dangerous word in my life.Michael looked out into the distance.He knew one of Saras gifts was that she was so pragmatic and methodical about life.This way of thinking had driven her to be extremely efficient, and she was certainly one of the best pilots he had even met.She believed completely in cause and effect, and nothing would sway her belief.She had lost hope in the idea of hope itself when her home world had been obliterated.She simply couldnt dare to hope again as she had faced the desolation of life after all hope was lost.Sara, trust me; I know we can do this, he said confidently.Can I really trust the Epherian Emperor?she asked with a dash of sarcasm, raising an eyebrow.Thats up to you.Will you use your magic if we get into trouble?If you say yes I just might hope a little.Its not magic; its science.Im sorry, Captain, but what you do is not scientifically possible.Its only seems like magic because you dont understand it.You have to understand that the End Machine would know our exact location if I used my powers.The End Machine or eight hundred aliens fighters.Which would you prefer to fight?she asked.Neither, but certainly not both at the same time.SEVENTEEN      Michael watched the navigation console as the Out Drifter drew closer to Moros Gamma.He expected to drop out of interstellar speed at any moment.The aliens know were here, said Sara as she reached up and drew down the combat visor.Are you ready, Captain?He nodded as she switched to normal speed.The ship drastically slowed and Moros Gamma appeared in their viewing panel.The planet was relatively close to a small red dwarf star.Sara instantly veered to the right and downward and then turned the ship back toward the planet, increasing the engines to full power.Michael couldnt see the blockade.Where are they?Above us, she yelled.A moment later a cascade of bright laser beams lit up the darkness of space; it looked like it was raining lasers.An explosion rang out and the Out Drifter rattled.The electronic shield instantly dropped to fifty five percent.We have three hundred fighters on our tail, she yelled as she brought the Out Drifter into a spiralling evasive maneuver.The space surrounding them was lighting up with plasma blasts and rockets were whizzing by.Sara fired every weapon she could.The Out Drifter had over eighty rockets remaining, and she unleashed every last one in an attempt to hold back the alien pursuit.Here is the rescue party!she said.Dozens of ships were approaching from the planet.A heavy blast rang out, and the Out Drifter shook again.The entire control console switched off and went completely dark; a moment later the console flickered on again and powered up.Michael breathed a short lived sigh of relief.The life support emergency light started flashing.Captain!We have a hull breach!Were losing oxygen!How long?Not long!Theres a small hole in the ceiling of the cargo bay.Im closing off the cargo bay doors and isolating the area.Is everyone out of there?Theyre in the living room, but Ethan is in the engine room.She hit the internal com switch.Ethan, I have to seal you in!We have a hull breach.Do what you need to do replied Ethan.Seconds later the Morosian fleet rocketed by and engaged the alien fighters in close combat.The Morosian squadron was an assortment of rundown rust buckets.The battle erupted behind them.Saras entire focus was on getting to the surface of the planet.The shield was at three percent, and the hull breach was destabilising the ship.She was straining to keep control.They entered the planets upper atmosphere and the ship started to shake.A group of alien fighters broke away from the main battle to follow them.Captain, divert whats left of the electronic shield to the upper side of the ship.Michael couldnt see her reasoning.Shouldnt we protect the back?Not unless you want to be cooked by the friction as we pass through the atmosphere.We need to protect area where the heat shield has been breached.Will three percent be enough?he asked as he diverted the remaining power of the shield to the top of the ship.Sara ignored the question; she went into a trancelike focus as she guided the ship through the atmosphere.She kept a blistering pace, as fast as she possibly could with a crippled ship.A group of alien fighters were gaining on them and had entered the atmosphere.Michael watched the shield system indicator; one percent remaining.He looked out through the viewing panel and could see the mountain ranges below.They flew through some scattered clouds descended on a downward gradient toward the surface.Sara reached forward and hit the external com switch.General Khar, this is the Out Drifter.We have entered the atmosphere with fourteen alien fighters in pursuit.We need a navigation signal to follow to your docks.Do you have any ground based defences?Our ship is damaged.We cant hold off these fighters.Theyll be on us in less than a minute.Were sending a squadron of combat air vehicles to assist, said General Khar.Our land based cannons will make light work of them if they keep following you.The navigation signal is on.Keep a steady line of approach  Sara glanced at Michael.We are lucky this time, she said.A moment later a squadron of about fifty air vehicles appeared in the distance.Sara followed the signal and seconds later the squadron flew past and attacked the alien fighters behind them.The alien formation split as the battle erupted.They continued to descend and followed the navigation signal which led them into a deep canyon between two rows of towering mountains.They then followed the base of the canyon and arrived at an immense cliff face which made up the side of a mountain.A huge spaceport was carved directly into the mountainside.The entire area was crowded with battlements and heavy turret guns of every variety.Sara slowed the ship down and entered through the great opening which led into a gigantic cavern.There were a series of landing platforms; most of them were empty.A group of people were waiting for them at one of the last platforms.Sara gently landed and shut down the reactor.She closed her eyes and took a deep breath.**  Gartax sat in his raised command seat in the dark and dingy central chamber of his fleet battleship.A subtle red glow lit the entire area, and the chamber was kept moist by dripping condensers in the ceiling.Gartax had always felt at home in dank environments.He sneered down at his five advisors; they trembled in fear as they looked up at him.Gartax hated everyone and everything in existence, even his own race.His mind fed on the feeling of hate.Hate drove him onward, and it was hate that gave him his power.He craved power alone, because in his corrupt mind he could only see two real possibilities for any living creature: power or vulnerability, and he despised vulnerability with his entire being.He was the master of the entire fleet, and it was precisely through his commitment to hate and the accumulation of power that he had climbed through the ranks to his position.He clearly remembered the defining moment when he had killed the former Fleet Master with his bare hands.The overwhelming feeling of power he felt in that moment had stayed with him ever since.Why havent we found the exiles?he asked bitterly in the harsh alien language.Our scout ships have searched constantly, answered Akemak, who was one of his longest surviving advisors.Akemak had been an advisor for five months, which was far longer than any other advisor had previously survived in the same position.Not good enough!growled Gartax.Akemak took a step back and lowered his eyes.He dared not say another word or disagree with the Fleet Master.From the far side of the command chamber appeared an alien with large dark eyes that were tinged with purple.His skin was a pale shade of grey which reminded Gartax of himself; there was a striking resemblance.He felt a little less hate for this newcomer for this reason alone.The aliens name was Fraxon, an ambitious youngster who had climbed quickly through the fleet ranks.Fraxon crossed the floor and stood before Gartax.I have personally located the exiles, he said proudly, bowing his head low.Gartax felt a rush of excitement rise through his body.Speak!he howled.The exile ship was seen by our fleet guarding Moros Gamma.Moros Gamma!repeated Gartax with a doubtful sneer.If you are mistaken I will have you cast into the vacuum of space.I have verified the unique design and specifications of the ship myself.I am completely sure the exiles landed on Moros Gamma.I would not bring you this information unless I was sure.I expect you to kill me if I am wrong, but I am not wrong.Why would they go to Moros Gamma?I do not know, answered Fraxon.Gartax turned to his advisors.Capture them!Divert every available ship to the blockade at Moros Gamma.Take these exiles alive and bring them to me in chains.Gartax could hardly contain his excitement.You have done well, Fraxon.You may have Akemaks position as Fleet Advisor.Akemak, I condemn you to live out the rest of your life alone on an uninhabited mud world.There you will find plenty of opportunity to pursue your ambitions among the worms.Akemak collapsed to his knees.Fleet Master, please; I have served you well.Not well enough.Take him away!growled Gartax, sneering and baring his sharp teeth.Three guards appeared from openings in the side of the chamber.They roughly grabbed Akemak and proceeded to drag him across the floor.Gartax watched until Akemak was gone and then chuckled in pleasure.He looked back to his remaining advisors.Return my ship to base.I will inform the Master Shadow.**  Michael was the first to leave the ship.A gathering of about twenty men were waiting for them on the docking platform.They were rugged mountain men with long beards, and they were all wearing mountaineering clothes.Ajax, Ivan, Acacius and Cynthia followed Michael over to greet the Morosians.A tall and proud looking man with a long grey beard, dark eyes and strong features stepped forward from the group.He examined the crew for a few moments before speaking.I am General Khar.I am the leader of the Morosians.Welcome to our world.You are the first visitors from another world to come to Moros Gamma since the alien siege began six years ago.My name is Captain Michael of the Out Drifter.We almost didnt make it.Passing the blockade wasnt easy.We understand the difficulty.Every ship we sent to help you was lost.We were forced to reactivate the EPHX cannons immediately after you entered the atmosphere.Our ships couldnt return even if they wanted to.Im sorry to hear about your loss, said Michael.It was a necessary sacrifice, said General Khar sternly.Those men did what they had to do to save our people.We Morosians believe in sacrificing ourselves for the survival of our people.This is the only reason we have endured and our neighbours no longer exist.It was a noble choice they made, agreed Michael.It was not their choice.They followed my command, said Khar indifferently.Khar stared at Michael for a long moment.The strain in the Generals dark eyes was clearly evident, and there was a similar look in the eyes of every other man in the Morosian group.The constant threat of complete obliteration had taken a heavy toll.Did you bring the lenses?asked Khar.All of them, replied Michael.Good.We are grateful to you.Honestly, we did not expect anyone to come, or rather, we did not expect anyone would be able to reach us.You are welcome to stay in our city until you are ready to depart.We will pool together the one billion credits for the transfer.It will take at least a day to gather the money.Were not in a rush.My mechanic needs to repair my ship.We had some minor hull damage as we fought our way through the blockade; its nothing we cant fix, but we need a day or two to complete the repairs.Our mechanical engineers will be willing to help if you require assistance.Thank you, General Khar.**  Sara, Ethan, Dog Two and Gopher agreed to stay with the ship.Ethan had enlisted Gophers help, as it turned out that Gopher had worked as a mechanic before becoming a thief.Ajax would have preferred Gopher to stay in deep sleep until they could drop him off on an appropriate world, but Michael wanted to give Gopher a chance in much the same way he had given Ajax a chance.Michael, Acacius, Ajax, Cynthia and Ivan were led by General Khar and his men to the far side of the docking platform.A series of elevator doors were set in the rock wall.These elevators take us deep underground to Hadeseron, our last remaining city, said General Khar.The aliens destroyed our surface cities in their first assault.We lost two thirds of our population.We were forced to move the remaining population to Hadeseron, which was an underground mining town before the war.How many people live in Hadeseron?asked Cynthia.Two and a half million, answered Khar.We expanded the city to accommodate our entire population.The surface of the planet is not safe, even with the EPHX cannons, because the EPHX cannons can only prevent spaceships, rockets and bombs reaching the surface.The aliens use long range lasers against anyone who chooses to venture above ground.There is nothing we can do to stop the laser attacks.They entered one of the elevators, which was large enough for a vehicle.Moments later they were rapidly descending.After about two minutes the elevator came to a complete stop.We are three kilometres beneath the surface, said Khar.The elevator door slid open.Directly ahead was a massive subterranean cavern.Lining the rocky walls of the cavern were five levels of walkways.Many metal bridges spanned the distance between the walkways.Side tunnels shot off in every direction.The area was bustling with people, and it seemed to Michael that the cavern was the centre of the underground city.Every man had an untrimmed beard and mountaineering clothes, and the women wore long silky dresses, which appeared to be colour coded depending on their age.The women seemed to be congregating in groups away from the men, and it was instantly apparent to Michael that the Morosian culture was strictly divided along gender boundaries, which the entire population adhered to without exception.Khar led them across the smooth stone ground into the city and everyone stared at them as they continued on.Our survival is linked to our ongoing commitment to our traditions and cultural values, said Khar.Every Morosian is happy to follow our traditional way of life.We do what we must do to survive.You should know, Captain Michael, we think Morosians are far superior to every other civilisation in Triangulum.Our ongoing survival is evidence of the strength of our people.We have outlasted every other civilisation in our region.Thats absolute space junk, said Ajax with a laugh.The only reason you have survived so long is because you have those EPHX cannons.When they fail itll be goodbye Moros Gamma.Id give the aliens two hours to wipe you out.Khar lifted his chin.He glared at Ajax and his eyes burned with wrath.You insult my people, he hissed, his lips curling sharply downward.Ajax met Khars stare and stood tall.He clenched his fists.No, Im not insulting your people, but I think youre insulting everyone who has died fighting in the war.We are in this together.No one is better than anyone else.The situation was about to explode.Khar was a proud man, and Michael could see he wasnt someone who would easily back down.The last thing he needed was a fight between Ajax and the leader of the Morosians.General Khar, we admire the self discipline of your people, said Michael.We understand the suffering and sacrifice you have faced whilst fighting the aliens.Ajax, tell General Khar that you understand the sacrifice the Morosians have made.I understand, said Ajax soberly, but he didnt unclench his fists.You see, said Michael, looking back to Khar.Khars eyes shifted from Ajax to Michael.You will never find a more self disciplined people anywhere in Triangulum, he said.It is wrong for me to become angry.The words of your crew carry little weight and will not change the way things are.My men will show you to the guest chambers.Later this afternoon I would like to host a feast in your honour.It is our custom to welcome guests.A feast?questioned Cynthia.Indeed, a feast, said Khar.He directed some of the men to guide them to their rooms and then walked away without another word.**  They were taken down a side tunnel which led away from the main cavern.Their rooms were not far from the exit elevator and were small chambers carved out of the rock.They were each given their own room which consisted of a small bed, a communication console which was attached to the wall beside the bed, and a small wooden desk.Cynthia rested on her bed.She reflected on the time since joining the crew of the Out Drifter, and her mind was in a spin with everything that had happened.Her original plan was only to get off the space station; at best she hoped to join a crew and make a modest income.The last thing she expected was to be working for the Epherian Emperor and be caught up in a quest to save humanity.Her doorbell sounded.She quickly sat up and walked across her chamber.Acacius was standing outside the door.Acacius, is everything okay?I need to talk with you, Cynthia.There is much you need to know.EIGHTEEN      Gartax was on his knees in the central dome of the alien fleet command.He was trembling as the Master Shadow swirled around him like black smoke.The darkness pressed against the light.Icy shivers were shooting through his body.He had never been so terrified in his whole life, and he could hardly keep himself from falling face first to the ground.The presence of the Master Shadow was overwhelming, and he felt he could die at any moment.There is a risk, said the End Machine.The exiles could escape before I arrive at Moros Gamma.You will send a message to your commanders and tell them to offer the Morosians a peace treaty.Tell the Morosians that they will have peace if they deliver the exiles to us.I have calculated that they will give you the exiles.The exiles must not be harmed; I want to examine them closely before I destroy them.In three days I will arrive at Moros Gamma, and I will take the exiles from your fleet.They must not be allowed to escape.They will not escape, said Gartax, bowing low.What if the Morosians refuse to hand them over?What if they dont trust us to keep the treaty?They are desperate people; they will cling to any glimmer of hope you give them.I will completely obliterate their world if they do not agree.What about the treaty?We cannot suffer the existence of a human world at the centre of our growing empire.The End Machine laughed, and the menacing laughter echoed throughout the dome.A deathly silence followed.Gartax lifted his eyes and gazed up into the swirling shadows above.Terror filled his entire being.Your kind was built to consume.You are parasites and nothing but an aberration.You have more in common with a machine than a living creature.I attempted to rebuild a human being from raw elements.You are the failed consequence of my ambition, entirely corrupted.Your hollow minds are focused solely on the acquisition of power; nothing else will ever matter to you.You only work together for mutual benefit.For these reasons you would not be able to honour a peace treaty even if you wanted to.Once you have imprisoned the exiles you can continue your siege or do whatever you want with the Morosians.Gartax bowed his head low.We will do what you ask.**  Michael sat at the desk in his chamber.The strain of the enormity of the task at hand was beginning to show.He felt the shadow of the machine was growing nearer.His priority was to get off the planet as soon as possible.He lifted his wrist com.Sara, how are the repairs progressing?Well hello, Captain she answered.Theyre nearly complete, or at least we dont have a hull breach anymore.Gopher is quite a mechanic; even Ethan is impressed with his skills  Are we ready to fly out of here?We can leave if we need to.Ethan and Gopher are working on repairing the outer armour, but, Captain, to be honest, I dont think we can pass the alien blockade  We made it through once.Im sure we can do it again, he said.Captain, we had the help of the Morosian fleet, and the Out Drifter was nearly destroyed.We narrowly avoided a rapid decompression.A few more seconds and it wouldnt have mattered if I sealed off the cargo bay  Do you have a plan, Sara?She didnt reply for a long moment.Michael looked at his wrist com, thinking it may have automatically switched off.Im working on it, Captain.Its going to be very dangerous.Ill do my best  Youre the best pilot in the galaxy.In that moment the doorbell sounded.Michael crossed his chamber and hit the door switch.The door slid open and Ajax was standing outside.Michael could instantly tell something was wrong.What happened?Ajax didnt answer and instead signalled for him to step out.Michael glanced left and right down the tunnel; Ajax was alone.The door automatically closed behind him.They have planted listening devices in our rooms, whispered Ajax.Are you sure?asked Michael in a low voice.Im completely sure.I have an advanced spy scanner integrated into my wrist com.I dont trust these Morosians.Cap, we have to get off this planet.I agree.Sara said the Out Drifter is nearly ready to fly.Once we make the credit transfer we will leave without delay.Sooner the better, said Ajax.What should we do about them spying on us?Its not right, Cap.Dont do anything.My guess is theyre only spying on us as a precaution.Pretend you havent noticed.Its best if they dont know that we know.Well be out of here soon, and I dont want to create any unnecessary commotion.**  Cynthia, Acacius, Ajax, Ivan and Michael were taken into a large luxurious dining chamber which was adorned with fine tapestries.Before them was a long oak table covered with dozens of prepared dishes.Khar directed the company to sit along the right hand side of the table.Five commanders of the Morosian armed forces were seated opposite them.Khar took the seat at the head of the table.The tapestries are impressive, said Michael.Indeed, they are, said Khar.These tapestries were woven four hundred years ago by our people to record the history of our civilisation.The first tapestry shows the era of settlement and terraforming our world.Our world was never considered a prime world by the Epherian Empire, but to us it has always been treasured, and we would not trade Moros Gamma for any prime world.Actually, I would be prepared to say the harshness of our world is the precise reason we are so strong in our disposition.It takes a strong world to forge a strong people like us.They are well made, said Ivan.Yes, they are.Such ancient crafts have been lost elsewhere in the galaxy.Khar lifted his chin; the haughty expression never entirely left his face.You will be happy to know we have pooled the one billion credits together on a single GCTD.He reached into his jacket pocket and drew forth a GCTD.He looked at the device for a moment and he drifted off into thought.I remember the time when credits were important.Our trade with other systems was always at the forefront of our minds.The alien attack changed everything.Credits are worthless to us now.After our last trading partner fell to the aliens we decided to abolish the guild credit system.You see, there is really no need for credits anymore.We only need to survive the invasion.He placed the GCTD on the table and slid it across to Michael.Michael read the indicator which clearly stated one billion credits.He took out the GCTD that Tyr had given him and connected it to the other which was unlocked.The credits instantly transferred from one device to the other.Thank you, said Michael.As I said, credits have little meaning to us.Gathering the funds was a simple process.My people were more than willing to part with them.We will be ready to leave in the morning, said Michael.The sooner the better, said Ajax gladly.Very well, said Khar, averting his eyes.However, there is one problem.My commanders believe there is no chance of your ship breaking the alien blockade.We simply do not have a fleet able to help you pass as you did before.For these reasons we have decided not to lower our defences.What are you saying?growled Ajax.Powering down the EPHX cannons again would carry a significant risk, continued Khar.The aliens are waiting for us to drop our guard.We believe you should remain here permanently because it is impossible for you to leave.We have no intention of staying here, said Michael firmly.Lowering our defences was never agreed to in the terms of the deal with the Tunnel Makers.We only agreed to transfer of funds, nothing more, said Khar, staring blankly at Michael.Michael leaned back in his chair and crossed his arms.Obviously it goes without saying.We deliver the goods and you allow us to leave.Not necessarily, replied Khar.My first priority, as I previously stated, is the survival of my people.I will not put my people at risk to benefit a small group of smugglers.You knew this was the case when we arrived, said Michael, raising his voice.Perhaps, but it does not matter.We are two and a half million people; your needs are insignificant in comparison.You are a reasonable and intelligent man, Captain Michael.Surely you understand that it is not wise to risk the lives of so many for the benefit of so few.But we only need you to shut down the cannons for a few seconds, argued Michael.Seconds we cannot spare, replied Khar indifferently.You lied to us, said Acacius.We would not have made the delivery if we knew of these terms before our arrival.Khar lowered his eyes and shook his head.You will be given a place among our people, which is a great gift from our perspective.This is space rot!yelled Ajax, kicking his chair back and standing up abruptly.He slammed his fist into the oak table.We dont want your gift!Im not staying here.I dont care if I have to use a jetpack to get off this planet!I dont want to stay here either, said Cynthia.Dont worry, Cynthia; we will be leaving, said Ajax with a snarl directed at Khar.Khar ignored Ajax and Cynthia.He looked directly at Michael.Your ship would be incinerated in seconds if you tried to pass the EPHX cannons; nonetheless, you are more than welcome to make an attempt.Michael stood up and stared harshly down at Khar.You are pushing me into a corner, General Khar, he said sternly.I dont have a choice, said Khar, his voice icy.We will give you time to think about our terms.Im sure, if you are reasonable, you will see we are right.You always have a choice, said Acacius.I do not agree, said Khar.This feast is over, said Michael.Everyone, gather any gear you left in your rooms.Return to the Out Drifter as soon as possible.We need to discuss our options.**  Michael and Ivan were walking back to their rooms together as their rooms were located in a separate tunnel from those allocated to where Cynthia, Acacius and Ajax.My facial and emotion recognition programming detected some inconsistencies with what General Khar was saying to us, said Ivan.What do you mean?I believe General Khars mind is divided.I recognised patterns of a person who is choosing between two options.It seems like he has made up his mind to me, said Michael.No, Captain, he is considering a second alternative.He may want to dispose of us, or something of a similar nature.Why would he want to kill us?I do not know; nevertheless, murder is only one possibility among many.All the more reason we get out of here as soon as possible, said Michael, quickening his step.They turned to enter the tunnel which led to their rooms.They were met by a group of ten heavily armed Morosian soldiers.Michael instinctively reached for his pistol.Freeze!commanded the leader of the squad.Michaels hand was resting on the holster.The soldiers had their plasma rifles ready to fire.He considered using his powers, but he knew that would only show the End Machine their exact location.Whats this about?he asked.The soldiers didnt answer.A moment later a second squad of soldiers appeared in the tunnel behind them, cutting off their exit.General Khar walked up from behind the second group.This is about the survival of my people, answered Khar.Dont worry, Captain Michael; you will not be harmed.What do my crew have to do with your survival?said Michael.We delivered the goods you requested and you paid us.We have no further business.You are right.I am sorry for treating you and your crew this way, but my people face desperate times, and we must take every available advantage.Khar turned so he had his back to them.Just before I met with you in the dining room I agreed to a peace treaty with the aliens.The aliens are not interested in peace, said Michael.Youre wrong, Captain Michael.They offered us a peace in exchange for you and the crew of the Out Drifter.They want you unharmed.We agreed to the terms.No!said Michael as icy shivers spread through his body.You cant do this to us.Regretfully, we have no choice.I already agreed to the treaty, said Khar as he started to walk away.Michael felt three darts strike his chest.The potent synthetic tranquiliser quickly seeped into his bloodstream.He struggled to hold himself up, but he collapsed within seconds and everything went dark.
