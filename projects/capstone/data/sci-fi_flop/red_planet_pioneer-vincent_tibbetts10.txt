It reached out and grabbed the car with its invisible powers, slowing it down to arrive at the station at a safe coasting speed.Alec wasnt looking for this type of safety right now, not with what he was about to do.The railcar they were in may have been unmoving, but the things they were contemplating would have them speeding away from each other for a very long time to come.There was nothing out there that could stop them from following through with this, not an electronic breaking system or even the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.Once set into motion nothing would ever bring them back, not even their longing desire.Its the only way.She fell toward him and they embraced.As he held onto her, he noticed how well her frame fit into his.It was rather uncanny, as if they were made to fit in this way.This warmth sprang a wealth of truth from within him.You make me want to believe.Believe in the good that is hope and dreams, believe in a time where creating is happiness and success is life.With all of this I wish I could override what I have set into motion.Stop everything I am right here in the happy place of that dream so I may live.He stepped back from her, breaking their bond for the last time.You are the only precious cargo I have in this world, and I need to know you have been delivered safely away from this place.The new car pulled into its stall and the robotic machinery went quickly to work unloading its contents.With that Alec also sprang into action, he made his way out of the railcar and crossed the tarmac to the island terminal located a short distance away.He was still hurting and it showed as he climbed up the ladder to stand behind the control panel.He activated car after car within the facility, commanding them to move down the rails and to the launch station.He kept working the board, glancing up until he saw I Glos railcar begin to move.She hung out the doorway as if she were helplessly tied to its frame, staring back at him, beckoning him to return.As the car moved further away she reached out toward him, hand extended as if she were trying one last time to grab him.He forced a smile, trying to send her one last message of comforting thought, but it wasnt working.There was nothing about what was happening that would make them feel comfortable.Her car slowly made its way down the tracks until it blended in with the others.With enough of them on the rails, he was hoping they would have a harder time tracking her.There was a very good chance they were already preoccupied with the other things he had put into motion.As those cars began to line up, he knew I Glo was no longer standing in the doorway.He could picture her sitting back in the car, readying herself for the accelerated push down those tracks.He watched as her car dumped down into the launch position and the machinery operating those magnets ramped up until her car was jettisoned away.As her car sped down those tracks he had the strongest of thoughts echoing in his head that one day he would see her again.He wondered in that one moment how possible it was for him to be able to lie to himself.What were the real possibilities of him ever seeing her again?There were things at play out there beyond his scope of control.How did something like happenstance, fate, or the probabilities of chance play into his personal life?Did the heavens have the ability to alter the course of mighty rivers to directly affect his personage, or were his experiences more germane to the natural progression of how he interacted within the day to day things of the here and now?The quantum was deep with inquires from Dextoids searching for answers to those very questions.Did their lives have a preordained destiny or were they fully in charge?The answers to those questions might never come.An unsolvable universe was the timeless thorn in the side of all thinking entities.For if there were unanswerable things out there, then people were basing their lives in acts of faith.Maybe this was where he should mentally be.He needed to have faith and know one day their paths would cross.Those thoughts were swirling around in his head and raced away from him as the last of the railcars left the depot.It was only then he noticed all of the machinery in the place had ceased working.The eerie quiet was broken only on occasion by the pneumatic pop of machinery hissing their release of pressure to stand down.Even these primitive things were allowed to find a peaceful solitude between their tasks.He looked back at the headless body of Straka.Even in his death he was the one egging him on now.He was the one adding another thing onto his plate before Alec was allowed to truly leave.Damn his words.He added another layer to what needed to be accomplished.A siren began ramping up within the depot, blaring its loud horned warning.Alec recognized the alarm, it was signifying the immediate evacuation of this biosphere.They were onto him now.13 Finale Washburn watched in horror as Alec relentlessly beat down Straka.He was quite aware both were Dextoids but found he could not stop flinching with each blow delivered.It was very disconcerting to have to witness this type of imagery on a monitor, and it made him feel as if he were privy to a point in time he wasnt supposed to see.There was nothing pleasant about peering into these last few moments of Strakas life.An aggression was being played out before him that somehow painted humanity in a very sad light.As he pondered this thought, he questioned why they were making Dextoids to look like people at all?The man leading them down this road sat unmoving in his chair, it was clear to Washburn now that Xavier represented an even uglier slice of humanity.How he was able to remain so calm after hearing Washburns report was beyond his comprehension.The reaction wasnt rational and confounded a number of his sensibilities.Xavier should have been showing some real emotion, expressing something along the lines of shock or anger at what Washburn had conveyed to him.Why wasnt he slamming his fist onto the desk, standing up and screaming at anyone who would listen?Why wasnt he making a complete scene as he was so famous for doing at times just like these?No one would have faulted him for the outburst; it would have been for all the right reasons in trying to save this place.Their world was on the verge of spinning out of control.It had taken some time for Washburn and his staff to put the pieces of the puzzle together, but when they were finally able to reassemble what Alec had put into motion, it sent chills down the spines of everyone involved.It was only natural to have a reaction like that when someone found out a disaster loomed on their horizon.Yet there sat Xavier, showing no signs of panic whatsoever.In fact he slightly smiled at times watching the fight.The man had clearly checked out and was on Roman Holiday.Up on the screen Alec was pummeling Straka to death.It was such a gruesome sight and only punctuated the reckless creature that had escaped them.It had been about an hour ago when they finally cracked the case for what had happened back at Outpost One.They flipped through the digital images of Alec breaking into rooms and saw him partially destroy the one they had interrogated I Glo in, he paused there just long enough to manipulate a laptop and then made a beeline for the flight command center.It took them a while to interpret the data from inside the command center, but when that first analyst deduced what Alec had done, the analyst let out a helpless sigh.In the entire time they investigated Alec they looked for rockets he might use for his possible escape.They feared the day it was made known he was making his way into the rocket garden where I Glo resided.Instead Alec had fooled them all, reprogramming the coordinates of three Kairos rockets from their inbound paths back at that flight command center, and zeroed them in on this biosphere.From all indications he hadnt adjusted their course with any intention of touching them safely down outside the front doors of this facility.They would race across the sky with huge black plumes of smoke trailing behind them until they slammed into this place as if they were the crackling bolts of doom sent down from the God of War himself.Alec had gone about locking them out from fixing the problem.Washburn never knew commands like that were even possible, it was a coding horror they couldnt hack, not in the short amount of time since being discovered.If Alec were meant to be an agent of chaos, it was clear to everyone he was capable of doing his job well.The natural thing for Xavier to be doing after hearing about these inbound rockets was rallying his troops the best way he knew how.Every second wasted was another second putting those broken arrows closer to their target.Xaviers reaction wasnt rational, in fact, it wasnt very human at all.Washburn thought about all those lunch time conversations he had with his fellow employees, all the idle chit chat over cups of coffee and social gatherings, where people had whispered their hushed toned innuendos accusing Xavier of dipping into the biological pool of the Dextoids.There were some who firmly believed he had been having the technology implanted into his system for quite some time.Washburn had read the reports coming from Earth about this subject and they were quite upsetting, highlighting the inherent risks of indulging in that kind of biotechnology.The people who did this became addicted to the process and couldnt stop themselves from having those grafts done over and over again.There were horrible tales spinning off that planet, of human beings having gone too far, of incarcerating individuals for their own good, locking them away from the public scrutiny because they had taken this process far beyond anything that could still be considered human.The rumors were ugly only because they pointed to an island colony having to house those wretched souls.Most were in need of dire treatment and would never be allowed to return to society because of how badly mutilated they had become.It was frightening for Washburn to think Xavier might be falling under the shadow of temptation from the dark arm of this technology.There would be no easy answers for the colonists if things kept progressing down this path.Some of them might not consider Xavier being human any longer.They would break off into their own separate camps, rejecting his leadership.The company would lose positive control over this entire process, meaning there would be a real hell to pay.There were things about these rumors that confounded Washburn, he knew firsthand they had a crack medical staff up here.They had treated him on several occasions, even when he had his tragic accident and lost a limb.The doctors had a remarkable technique for printing out new cells, layer upon layer, in his case until they had regenerated his arm and seamlessly fit it back onto his body.They were able to provide an amazing amount of healthy medical possibilities to those patients in need, the procedures were clean, fused with the body, and functioned properly.Washburn looked down at his arm, even to this day he couldnt tell they had bred those cells and printed them out.So with all of these miraculous medical capabilities at Xaviers disposal why was it he still had all that visible scar tissue on the back of his head?Could it be things werent healing correctly, or perhaps it was the fact they had to keep opening him up to go in and change things about his rumored graft.How long would he dabble in this world of Dextoid Infusion before he finally decided to stop?When questioned by their captors, the mutants back on Earth described those grafts as an empowering process, always hissing at their reach for immortality.Those three Kairos Rockets were about to put that to the test.When they finally hit this place, it would wipe the slate clean for all of them.Washburn made a note to himself, making sure he questioned the medical staff about what they knew of Xaviers scar when they got to their next destination.Sir!Washburns bark was meant to snap Xavier out of his trance.Shouldnt we be warning the others?Making preparations to leave the biosphere?Xavier never looked away from the images being pumped onto his viewing screens.He leaned back slightly and allowed himself to lift his right hand lazily in Washburns direction, slowly fluttering it at him as if to shoo him out the door.Of course Washburn, we must evacuate at once, tell your people.Xavier had this propensity to treat everyone around him as if they were somehow all getting in his way.People had put their blood and sweat into this place, why couldnt he see that?This was more than just a home to them, it was a functioning monument, representing the very achievement of their colonization efforts.Xavier could have easily provided them with the information they needed to walk away from this place.All he had to do was read a statement to be broadcasted over their corporate airwaves, the very technology he seemed to be so fixated on!It would give these colonists a chance to understand the emergency befalling them, responding in kind by organizing their own evacuations!Instead they were getting this lackadaisical version of Xavier, it was so cavalier, and they deserved so much more from him than this.Washburn was really dreading having to speak with him anymore, but his next question had to be asked.And the others sir?!This was the question that had Xavier finally turning away from his precious holographic screens.He stared at Washburn with the same contempt an adult would have when speaking to an unruly child.You should only concern yourself with the things that are in front of you, now go.That was it then.Turning his back, Washburn was exiting that room for the very last time.It was as if a huge weight were being lifted off of his shoulders.He had been secretly dreaming of the day he could leave this place and not have to answer to Xavier ever again.He wanted nothing more than to get his life back.What other company was going to allow him to define his own sense of freedom though?None of them had social structures designed to allow a man to live in that way.There was no getting around the fact he was a kept employee, and as soon as he landed, be it a foreign or a national base, he would be accounted for and made to report back to the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.There were more important things in front of him, and the ideas of fanciful flight would have to wait for another day.He had a responsibility to the people of this place.He knew it was more than that, this was about doing what was right, about caring for ones fellow man and being altogether human.The last thing he wanted was to have the souls of these colonists splattered across his consciousness.He watched them everyday as they went through their routines, working within the confines of this structure.It was his job as an investigator to be observant of their day to day activities.He saw how hard the people here were striving for consistency, they wanted tomorrow to be the same as today so they could build from it.Any time they were made to change their routine or became displaced from their settings, they got upset, even disoriented.It was only human nature to feel this way, how else could they advance?He shuttered with his next thought.When that alarm finally sounded, Deimos be damned, this place would fill with the scattering energy of chaos.Xavier turned a cold shoulder toward his Corporate Criminal Investigator.As far as he was concerned Washburn was just like everyone else up here, looking for a way in to try and take his job.Those cretins may have hungered for his position but they could never understand how deeply entrenched he was within this company.He was untouchable.Didnt they notice how every problem and transgression he caused washed off his back and onto unsuspecting others?Sure, they threatened him with sanctions on his accounts, berated him during their teleconferencing, but over time he came to find the corporation would always exonerate him.He began to carry himself with all the confidence a gambler would have when playing with house money.He knew the game was rigged, he just wasnt settling for the small pots they were allowing him to win.KEEPING FAIRNESS He blinked his eyes wide as he found himself watching the pixilated image of Alec staggering back over to the headless body of Straka.Xavier was torn on how he should be feeling after watching what had just happened on those screens.He had expected so much more out of Straka.Was it possible his expectations were based on faulty information?Could Straka have lied on his resume about once having been a Strike Dextoid or padded his statistics?He was supposed to represent state of the art technology when it came to being a Dextoid bounty hunter, but instead he looked like a rag doll in the hands of a brute.Xaviers disappointment for this situation would be short lived, he would win either way, at this moment Alec could live or die.Doing the latter would solve a lot of his problems, but they would not stop those rockets from falling onto this place.Nothing would.He let out a loud sigh.Alec was about to become a real agitant in Xaviers life.Everything else had played out according to his plan, now he needed Alec to expire.It was strange to have to acknowledge under these circumstances, but Xavier was quite proud of Alecs proficiency.Even as he watched him stagger around down on that platform, he knew Alec was operating well above their expectations.He was like a satellite launched with an operating window of only three years, but instead lasted a hardened fifteen.Couple this with the fact he was never supposed to leave the lab, and all of this was truly saying something about what Alec had become.There was no arguing he was genuinely one of a kind.If he were to survive all of this, the mere thought of his existence would strike a terror into the general population.Xavier began to rock in his chair with excitement, if Alec wouldnt die, than he would use this fact to his advantage as well.Calls had been coming in from all over the biosphere inquiring about what was happening in places like the security office, the flight terminal, and now the rumored destruction of this place.They wanted to know the severity of these threats, or get advice on how to react to the situation.They needed answers to the calamities that were befalling them and in that moment Xavier knew none of those calls would be answered.He was not to be disturbed.He left it to his underlings to sort through that mess, and without any direction from him.As far as he was concerned all those nagging people were the proletariat, and their voices had been growing for far too long.Wasnt this the same sick feeling he got from working at that firm back on Earth?He brushed those employees aside when he found he could no longer tolerate them, it was one of the deciding factors for coming to this place.It wasnt his fault the colonists had become a money grubbing rabble.Their impending doom translated into a thinning of the herd.The survivors of this disaster would have the message blasted into their consciousness to work longer and harder hours.They would need to rebound from this disaster, sacrificing much of themselves to achieve these goals.He found a personal satisfaction with those thoughts, probably because he would be there to take full advantage of their efforts.Up on some of the screens, reports were starting to air on the three Kairos Rockets.This unpleasant reality had traveled that far down the rumor mill, people all over this facility would be jumping out of their chairs with this news, and yet he still refused to pull the evacuation alarm to warn them.He allowed his hand to lightly caress his baldhead.Was he not the one who chose when these people lived or died?They needed to know he had this kind of power over them, the little Emperor inside him was insistent.The tide of confusion was almost upon them and Xavier would happily play the pan flute to all their screams and cries.It was a personal moment of glee, and it could have gone on for quite some time if he hadnt been interrupted.Someone was adjusting themselves in the chair on the other side of his desk.He slowly turned to see Harvard sitting there.As soon as Xavier made eye contact with him, Harvard chimed in with his own two cents, as if not to miss a beat in the thoughts Xavier was having.You should be answering each and every one of those calls coming in right now.The people need your help!There was a stillness as Xavier took this situation in.He wondered how Harvard kept doing this?Showing up as if he were materializing out of thin air with the capability of reading his thoughts.It was an unnerving trend Xavier knew he was going to need to bring to an end, and much sooner than later.What are you doing here?Shouldnt you be scrambling to an escape pod to save that precious little hide of yours?You know why I am here.Why I am always here, to remind you to do the right thing by these people.They need your help.Why dont you follow through with doing the right thing for once and help them?Help them?!What do you take me for?Morning, noon, and night all I have done is help these people and look where it has gotten us!Most of those needing this so called help arent worth saving.This place is going up in one gigantic fireball.I say wipe the slate clean and start anew.It was in that telling moment the evacuation alarm bellowed throughout the facility.Harvard pointed into the air as if he were able to point at the exact source of where the alarm was coming from.You see, youre wrong, someone does care.Someone out there realizes they deserve more than just a fighting chance.Its only fair after how hard these employees have worked, the sacrifices they have made, the time...Fair?!Xavier let out an explosively mocking laugh, as if it had been building up within him for quite some time now.Nothing has been fair since I left Earth for this miserable red rock.They have pushed us all to the brink of insanity.The twists and turns it takes to survive up here are maddening, and all the while the corporation squeezes this place for every last drop of blood.Harvard shot back.You sicken me with your conflict in the workplace excuses.Youre the one who pulls all of the levers up here.Youre the one allowing for this type of mentality to trickle down into their environment, and why?So they will toughen up to meet your standards?So you can mold them into what you want them to be!If they dont meet your expectations then you make them feel indebted to you, to the company!You chain them to this place as if they have an albatross tied around their necks.Who do you think you are?Xavier shot up out of his chair in reaction to this last remark.He walked over to Harvard getting right up in his face.Who am I?I will tell you who I am not, I will not cater to the weak, I will not allow people to walk away from their responsibilities, and I will not listen to you lecture me for one second longer.Xavier reached back and slapped Harvard across the face with the back of his hand.It was a blinding blow that sent him flying across the room attached to his chair.He crashed into the far wall, falling awkwardly upon impact.Xavier made his way back to his side of the desk, never acknowledging Harvard lying face down and obviously hurting.Without me you people would be nothing.You above all should know this.I am you.I am all of you.I made you, and I made them.You can keep a thing like fairness, it will only lead us down a road of ruin.Xavier sat comfortably back in his chair and began monitoring the screens again.He felt the message he had just sent to his sniveling assistant was pretty darn clear; he wouldnt be needing his services any longer.FUEL The Cesium particle quivered with a vigorous energy looking to be set free.It rapidly bounced within its tiny composite chamber, keeping with it a standard of time that was in sync with the rest of the known universe.It was just one particle, trapped within a tiny sphere that on the surface would appeared to threaten the very principles of uncertainty, but of course upon closer inspection it wasnt very close at all.The heat that drove this particle was a thin blue laser light, consistently hunting it down in an effort to spur it on.Alec could relate to the chase this particle was going through deep down inside him, and was surprised by the fact this chronometer was the timepiece that could drive him.It seemed as he approached a more excited state, he could actually hear the high pitched hum rise from within this little chamber.It was as if a human voice were trying to hold a note for an extended period of time, rising in pitch as it went on and on and on.The particle was singing to him now as he made his way back up the ramps and to the main floor of the biosphere.The pitch of it was pushing him to move a little faster, and he would need too if he were to have any chance of getting out of here alive.Back at Outpost One, when he broke into their flight command center, one of the things he did was thoroughly scan their shipment logs.Initially his search was to make sure no human lives were onboard the craft he was about to commandeer.After a short time of reviewing the records it was easy for him to see how as a colony, they had gotten behind the eight ball with needing those supplies.A rocket lost at launch back on Earth, another flying off course, or one crashing while trying to land here, it got to the point where they were living as if from paycheck to paycheck.At times those logs read as if they werent going to make it before the next shipment arrived.All of this had to have added another degree of difficulty to what the colonists were already trying to overcome.He likened their plight to the series of ramps he was currently trying to traverse.If one had found themselves all the way down at the bottom, there was no easy way back to the top.Twice he stepped aside as a group of people came running down the ramp looking for a way out.They were panicked and carried on their faces a look of confusion.Normally these ramps wouldnt have been such a chore for him, but his wound was hampering his ability.Even the casual observer would have noticed the hitch in Alecs gate.It was cause for concern, and he realized it could cost him in making it out of here alive.If there was one structure on this red rock housing the answers to all his questions, it would be the one he was making his way through right now.Deep within the chambers of this place hummed a bank of computers containing information as to who he was.It would have been like a haunting but he would have traversed those secret passages until he found the long cavernous tunnel to the dark subterranean sector from which he was born.It would be guarded no doubt, in layer after layer of corporate centurions and in his current condition that was a problem.Down there in the pit of that place was where projects were fused together, where subversive systems were developed and tested, and the boundaries for non lethal weapons were pushed to the fringes of human safety.No one was allowed to walk into those chambers unless they signed onto an oath of secrecy, swearing their complete allegiance to the corporation.If there was a subterranean cavern on this planet harboring a thing like hell, then this was it.He remembered coming in and out of consciousness and hearing the hideous cries of those creatures being brought to life and then extinguished because of their grotesque development.Those entities awoke to find themselves tightly bound to their tables, trapped behind the long strips of heavy plastic sheathing, and being forcefully injected with serums of experimentation.There was no accountability for the mental or physical scarring they were leaving on these living things.Down in that place men dawning biological suits covered in the blood of their creations brokered out sanity on a very cold slate.Operations were performed all the time without the use of anesthesia, and if a Dextoid shut down, it was brought back to life without a second thought for its well being.He closed his eyes to those unholy thoughts.It was tough for him to forget how hard all of those living things were fighting down there just to keep what little they had.That didnt stop them from pushing this technology to its very fringes, imbuing these animated creations to stay alive through all their pain and agony.Deep within this biological cesspool, past the areas stained with corybantic evidence, was where they housed their banks of quantum supercomputers.These pristine clean rooms were temperature controlled, sealed by double doors, and planned long ago to archive its data at peak quantum efficiency.As Alec mentally drifted off to that place, he wished he could reach out and pull the plug on the whole damn operation.There was something still chaining him to this place, something locked away in those underground chambers tugging at him.Could it be the entities down there were calling upon him to destroy this place, to end their own tortuous existence?It was indescribable what this influence could be, but it didnt mean the force did not exist.Soon the new moon would arrive to take its place in circling this world.It too would feel an invisible tug on its body as it forever tried to break away from its new parent planet.Alec could sympathize with that kind of struggle, knowing full well it would take something in the extreme to be able to break those bonds.Alec was certain they knew he would be back and try to descend into this secretive lair.They must have planned and schemed for this moment from the very first day he had escaped, laying out trap upon trap for him.He looked down at his wound, the gurgling wasnt as severe, but he couldnt be sure if it was because he was running out of fluid or if he was actually beginning to heal.None of it mattered, he wasnt in a position to fight them, not with how he was feeling.If they had planned for his arrival, then it also meant they feared it.Normally he could have used that knowledge to his advantage, he was sure it would have won him the day.Not now, not with this wound.With everything he was facing he would only have time to complete one task.This task was driving him now as he made his way through the back room of a fabric shop.There were bins filled with thread, buttons, beads and accessories, and an entire wall dedicated to bolts of material.This store contained everything a person could ever want if they chose to get lost in couture.The time for contemplating such polished self refinement of oneself was over.He made his way down a small hall which dumped him out into their stylish storefront.The place was strategically placed with mannequins dressed in chic apparel, sale racks, and wall bins all the way up to the ceiling.It did not surprise him the place was devoid of customers or even a Dextoid attendant.Anyone with common sense was getting away from this place.He flung the front doors open and soon found himself in the courtyard and their grand market place.The first thing to greet him out in this open area was the blaring noise of the evacuation alarms.Hearing them like this told him something about their situation, the rockets were indeed descending onto this biosphere, but it also rang with a truth that there was nothing these people could do to stop it.This knowledge actually began to fuel him.FRIGHTFUL PRAXIS From his office Xavier watched up on the screens as Alec swung open the front doors to the popular little boutique.It would not be long now before the Riot Control Robots he had summoned would come racing through the place in a strong show of force to try and apprehend this rogue Dextoid.Xavier at long last felt his grip beginning to tighten around this situation.As he studied Alecs movements on the screen, he could tell Alec was having a difficult time maneuvering.He would have no chance at defending himself against this suppressing force!His plan was sound enough.He would use the Riot Control Robots to wrestle Alec to the ground, overpowering him with shear numbers.Xavier would have him held there in the courtyard until those three inbounds buried him under the destruction of this place.If he were really honest with himself, he wanted to see the moment Alec vaporized in the explosion.Up on some of the other screens, the news coverage was beginning to intensify.The broadcasters were confirming the rumors about the evacuation.He watched as they showed pictures of people fleeing this biosphere anyway they knew how.There were rovers, escape pods, and shuttles, there were so many people driving away from this place that anyone watching would have been concerned.It was now that Xavier wished to capitalize on all this free press.Now was the time to take Alec down.The venue couldnt have been more public for allowing the final part of his scheme to unlatch!That courtyard represented ground zero for all the things in his life needing vindication.It was bought and paid for in more ways than one, by men like Theodore Hadley, Jarvis Kendle, and Jeb Wentworth, they would all pay for having sent him here all those years ago.It was at the moment the Riot Control Robots began to roll into view.Xavier sat back and thought about what the future might bring.There would be few if any that would remember how this whole affair had gotten started, but there were plenty who would remember how it would all end.The visual of this place crumbling to its foundation would stick in their hearts and minds for a very long time to come.It would create the lasting image he needed to hatch his evil plan.He would lean hard on the company and those grubby old men back on Earth, using the media in the coming months to orchestrate public support in getting the colonists to stick together.Stitching the unity they needed to build a place from the fortitude of those survivors, only they would build it according to his vision, and there was nothing any of them back on Earth could do about it.The company owed him.He was leaving his benefactors with very few choices and they couldnt have been more extreme.On one hand they would have to tolerate the vision Xavier had for colonizing Mars and on the other hand they had the nightmare Alec could very well become.In the end he knew they would never choose the side making it appear the Dextoids were winning.This was the doorstep he was leaving them on.Alec was the dark symbol for their greed and the unending desire for power.Xavier had given these lechers exactly what they wanted with his creation.After the rockets destroyed this place, and those excavation teams sorted through its rubble, no one on the board of directors would ever fess up or want to remember why they created him.The public would be screaming for a name in all of this mess.That name would become the face for this disaster, someone they could castigate and mercilessly crucify in the media.As it stood now he knew deep down inside those bastards back on Earth would be more than happy to give them his name.Those old men had grown to hate him, and the more they grew to hate Xavier, the more they realized they needed him.Their personal dislike of him did not mean much when it came to turning a profit.They had too much invested in this operation.He knew the name that would wind up in the hands of the Press, it would be Alecs.He was their frightful praxis dripping with the desire for conquering this world.The images of him destroying this facility would be all Xavier needed to snuff out anyone seeking the truth.He would make sure of it and thats where everyone would want to leave it.They had to because if they found Xavier guilty than so were they.He shook his head, the real irony was that Alec would have done their bidding without question if he had only been given the chance.He would have conquered this world and laid all the avarice Mars had to offer right at their feet.Xavier had other plans for him right from the start.He never stood a chance and now the only real value Alec had for Xavier would happen in his death.He watched those monitors intently as the final moments of Alecs life played out.AGAINST THE ONSLAUGHT The courtyard echoed with the wails of the evacuation alarm, drowning out any other sound the biosphere might have offered.The alarm was accompanied on occasion by a computerized female voice calmly instructing the occupants to evacuate.The voice may have been void of any emotion, but it clearly was stirring a response in the people who heard it.Alec knew the human beings doubting those warnings were the ones really entrenched in this place.They would never leave under any circumstance, even if it meant their own destruction.In every emergency there were always a handful of those types, acting out of defiance, as if their beliefs were stronger than the impending doom hurtling toward them.Alec wondered if he were currently acting out in this manner.Was his whole life based on an act of defiance?He was becoming aware of the fact he was fighting against something within his own being and he was also aware he was never going to surrender to it.Those rockets were approaching this place like the shadow of a terrifying eclipse.Nothing was going to stop that from happening.Glancing down at his wound, he wondered if this ugly gash didnt symbolize his own end.It was difficult for him to admit, even to himself, but it was getting harder and harder for him to know which thoughts were the ones they had given him and which were truly his own.There was a rumor floating around in the quanta that there were only eight basic plots for stories the human species could ever tell, those themes were constantly being reinvented to fit the times.It was hard for him to comprehend with all that was going on out there in the universethat the human experience was dictating the way these stories were being told.Record players could only play records, television sets could only reflect the media being broadcast on them, and human beings could only retell stories they could identify with.Each of these things operated within a certain narrow bandwidth.For Alec, this was an affront to every one of his senses.The moment before him was escaping.He needed to re focus, scale things back, concentrate on the immediate.He just wanted to find something solid to lean against so he could check his wound.Whatever was going on inside him still wasnt feeling quite right, he wanted to be able to examine his contusion.He contemplated going over to one of the large nearby trees planted within the exposed Martian soil of this biosphere.From the size of its thick base these trees must have been planted sometime ago because the only thing they were capable of flying all the way up here from Earth were the seeds.He scanned the lines of bark all the way up to the sprawling branches reaching skyward in a desperate effort to try and touch the translucent ceiling of this place.The canopy of fresh green leaves told him those trees still felt a connection to the sun.It was a simple exchange of carbon; the tree turned the carbon from the sun into this outreach of branching biology.When it finally passed on, it would collapse and begin to decay.People would gather its wood and use it in their fires, igniting it to watch it burn just like the sun that gave it life.Alec realized people were no different really in their development and thought.They grew roots in their ideology, and some of those roots wouldnt allow them to leave, even in the face of danger.Perhaps this was why they too chose to stay because the ideology they backed was born in that kind of fire.Under the right circumstances, everything burned.His contemplations were cut short by the appearance of three Riot Control Robots.From where Alec stood he could feel the ground under his feet tremble, so much so in fact that some of the leaves fell from their branches.The robots were heavy contrivances, looking to stand almost three meters high and supported by the wide base of their tank treads.Even with the evacuation alarm wailing away he could pick up on the noises those things were making, rattling loudly with the metallic sounds of their slats.They were ominous looking things, approaching him with their four long appendages spread wide in an array of catchall type framework.Three more Robots approached from the opposite direction.Xavier was watching with great anticipation, there was no doubt in his mind this was Alecs final chapter.He would bury the files on him with the destruction of this place.The truth would die in that rubble and be reborn as whatever Xavier decided to tell the investigators in those coming days.Alec stood his ground, not giving an inch.Tested to the last.Xavier found himself saying this with a great sense of pride.It was all going down just as he had hoped.Alec was standing up to the onslaught: he knew no defeat!There was a precision in his programming and a method behind his madness.He was all Spartan and would be described as nothing short when Xavier retold the tale at future cocktail parties.He would paint Alec as a proud but dying breed, driven out by the efficiency of cheaper technology.As Xavier watched, he felt his place secure for becoming the Emperor of Mars.What better way to celebrate the advent of his throne then with the sacrifice of one of his finest warriors, and this was for all to see.His assistant got up and slowly made his way back over to Xaviers desk.Harvard was fixated as well with what was happening up on those screens, albeit for different reasons.It was of no matter to Xavier, Harvard didnt hold his ear like he used too.They both watched as Alec reached into his tattered jumpsuit to reveal the weapon Straka once held.Hes got a gun!Harvards scream was shrill and would have terrified anyone in the room.His welted eye and broken nose compounded the unsightly horror he had become.Alec aimed carefully, lining up his first shot, and then pulled the trigger.Seconds after it had happened, both Xavier and Harvard heard the blast from where they stood.The robot he was aiming at had been blown to pieces as if it had been detonated from within.Alec didnt skip a beat, within seconds two more Riot Control Robots were laid to waste.Both Xavier and Harvard watched as the remaining machines kept approaching, it were as if they failed to comprehend the deadly meaning of the gun.Xavier realized there was no reason for these robots to ever have had this type of knowledge.No one was supposed to have a gun on this planet.It was a baffling flaw that was playing out before him, forcing his mind to spin unto itself until it was wound so tight he jumped out of his chair.Ready my escape pod, immediately!You cant leave ...I told you Harvard, I have no time for you or your drivel.I will monitor this situation from one of the remote sites.People will think you the coward for leaving them at this moment.It really doesnt matter what they think, does it.This place is about to go up in a fireball.Stop acting like you dont care!Xavier left, giving one last parting shot as he made his way out the door.And like I so delicately informed you earlier, I will not be needing your services anymore.Alec stood there drawing bead after bead on Robot after Robot, shooting them into unidentifiable pieces until they were destroyed.During their blitz it dawned on him this was the same weapon that had been used on him, only he had held up much better under the brunt of its slug.Taking aim at the last Riot Control Robot, he became very conscious of the violent recoil the weapon had.The noise accompanying this was deafening, sounding like a mechanical lions roar, It punctuating the thought he had about himself in the moment, that of being one tough motherfucker.How could a thing like a gun evoke this kind of feeling from within him?It seemed odd to fire a weapon and then immediately have an emotion such as vanity or empowerment attached to its use.He looked at the piece as it lay in his hand, the grip was warm and felt heavy.A thin stream of white smoke trailed from the smoldering barrel, as if to signal its use to anyone who might have cared.The gun was basic, lacking any type of chip or processor, there was no way for him to communicate with it directly, but somehow this piece had done just that.He stared at the weapon almost forgetting why he had taken it in the first place.The chamber lay wide open, signaling it was out of bullets.This was a real problem, it wasnt like he was wearing belts of ammunition, and unless he was intending on using it as a hammer or a paperweight, the gun was now rendered useless.This thought was all it took for the spell he was under to be broken.He re engaged his protocols for fleeing this place and tossed the weapon aside.As it skipped across the courtyard the thoughts Alec had for assassinating Xavier fluttered away with it.Those thoughts would simply have to wait for another day.THE CALMING WATER DROPLET The crews who constructed this biosphere installed sets of stairs that lead to the very top.Along the way they added catwalks to work at different levels with one of these ending at an evacuation station.Contained beyond were a small fleet of escape pods meant for the human workers trapped up here.Xavier found himself running wild and racing all the way up those stairs.At the doors of the evacuation station he laid his hand on the scanner and looked straight ahead at the green dot mounted on the wall.The lenses of the facial recognition software worked in conjunction with the hand scanner and it was the only way he was going to be allowed to get beyond the doors.The vehicles docked there should have been reserved for upper management, but there was too much protest from the people who worked at those heights.As he waited, Xavier could feel the raw energy of this place begin to permeate the air.There was an urgency to keep things moving, of wanting to leave, yet in this moment he had to stand there and exhibit nothing but patience.He made a mental note to address this issue in the building of the next superstructure.That one would be a palace and his next pathway for escape would flow much smoother than this one, because he would have his own personal pod.When the software finally acknowledged him, he passed through the doors to find most of the vehicles had already been taken.There were still a few left, but not as many as he would have liked.As he stood there deciding which one he should take, he thought he could hear the desperate clamor of the people far below him.Those poor souls were scrambling to find a way out of this place.Their cries for help were beaconing him, trying to pull him back into the biosphere.It was rubbish, a weak feeling that would only lead to other weaker feelings, and all of those weak feelings would only get him into trouble.Damn it!His shout was loud enough that it echoed off the walls.He realized the chamber he was standing in had been insulated from the noise of the blaring alarm or anything else that might be happening outside this area.He stomped his foot onto the floor.It gave him a twitch and caused him to want to stomp the floor again.He was fighting with himself.He knew the right thing to do was go back in his office and facilitate the evacuation.The thought of this was driving him to the point of madness.He could hear the voices in his head reprimanding him for not doing just that.The ringing in his ears steadily rose in tone.The thing inside his skull began to show itself, allowing for its tentacles to swell within his lobes.He hit himself in the head repeatedly with clenched fists trying to make it stop.Falling to his knees he yelled out, sounding as if someone were being murdered right there in front of him.This scream didnt just echo in the causeway, but in the catacombs of his mind, causing the thing inside him to suddenly constrict, interfering with the flow of cerebrospinal fluid.He fell forward straining for relief, crying out because it reflected the sharp pain he felt in the back of his head.What had they done to him?!You bloody bastards!He clawed at his scar, rubbing it abrasively causing it to bleed.He was trying to get to the thing they had sewn into his head.He wanted it removed.There had to be a Dextoid or a human being who would perform this procedure for him.The urgency for removing this made him feel uncomfortable, but it was because he couldnt let this thing be within him for one second longer.They were watching him.The thought crossed his mind as he knelt there holding his head against the floor.They were always watching everyone.This causeway was no different, it was loaded with cameras and heavily monitored for security reasons.The violent fit he had just thrown was being recorded, and if they werent watching it live, they would certainly play it back and analyze it later.He was motionless with this thought.He suddenly stood up and headed straight into an escape pod, the doors closed behind him.He was alone.He didnt care what they thought of him at this point, it was what it was.Those old goats back on Earth couldnt stop him.He controlled his own destiny now.Ill show you, Ill show all of you!He took a seat and waited patiently for his departure.He figured it should only be a few moments from the time he hit the button on the door.If there was a countdown happening he wasnt aware of it.There was a large creaking noise and he felt the slight punch of the escape pod as it launched itself safely away from the structure.He was away!All of Mars was in front of him now to the edges of its horizon.He felt it broad and wide and welcoming.He sent himself away with every intention of conquering that expanse.The smashing of this biosphere would send the politics of this place spinning into a state of emergency.He was laughing out loud with this thought, once he got those powers of absolute control, he would never turn the clock back to return them, ever!This was the moment he had thought about from the very first time those planners proposed building Alec.He plotted for it meticulously, and when they shrouded the creation of this Strike Dextoid in all those layers of secrecy, Xavier seized on the opportunity and enacted his own plan.Nothing about it was going to be easy.He had to have people he could trust to write the lines of code to get Alec to do the things he needed him to do.Those lines needed to be written without the possibility of anyone questioning the ethical side of why they were assigning Alec with those particular protocols.His real orders needed to be hidden in a creative way without anyone else ever stumbling upon them, and whoever was helping him do all this had to disappear once their task was complete.The only thing he knew that could meet all of those requirements and not be missed by anyone within the corporation was a Service Dextoid.Xavier left nothing to chance; he had his personal Service Dextoid program Alec.His mechanical servant had become as insidious as his master, filled with the dark secrets and lies of this place.Initially he was the one assigned to personally take care of the cerebral implant in Xaviers head.This Dextoid was already operating surreptitiously within the company making sure the graft was taking hold.As time progressed his mechanized servant developed into being closer to a henchman, Xavier was sorry to lose him, especially when compared to the likes of Harvard, that was a hire he had continually regretted.To the other technicians in that lab it looked as if Xavier had taken a personal interest in the project, allowing his Service Dextoid to be apart of the programming team.They felt it was there only to review the code.Having a Dextoid write code for another Dextoid broke more than one law, but deep down in that lab they were breaking rules all the time.The technicians carried themselves with an attitude of being absolved of any wrongdoing as long as their work got completed, nothing was ever supposed to leave that lab anyway.Alec blew the doors off that with his eventual escape, but what was the breaking of one more law if it meant in the end Xavier would get what he wanted?The Dextoid that programmed Alec hid those lines of code where only a Dextoid would find them, in the carousels of the quanta.If he wanted too, he could have written them down on the head of a pin, but that would have been too easy to find for anyone investigating this.It was important that Alec be driven by these things, but not commanded by them, who better to know how to do this than a Dextoid.There was no one out there who could stop Xavier now.He whispered a promise to himself as if to reaffirm his intentions.I will show you, Ill show you all.There are still too many loose ends for that too happen.Harvard said it with confidence.He sat there next to him, his posture was staunch and his eyes unblinking as he stared his boss down.Xavier jumped out of his chair.How in the hell did you get in here!I left you back there!I left you behind to die!Did you really think you would get rid of me that easily?You forget how much I am apart of you.Thats always been your problem, you think you have something over me, that I am beneath you, or that I dont have the ability to keep up with you, but yet here I am.I have always been more resilient than that imagination of yours.This cant be!Xavier began to feel a tidal force of anger swell up in him, he brought his fist back to smash Harvard in the face, and then stopped just inches short of delivering the blow.He was horrified with the realization that Harvard looked normal.His complexion reflected a state of good health.There was no evidence of scarring or bruising from the altercation he previously had with him less than an hour ago.Thats right Xavier, I too have a say in how I look, and in how I act.Harvard sat back a little more comfortably in his chair.You think you are better than me, but I know all the things you know, or all the things you will ever know.You always have this idea you can just get rid of me.What an amusing thought, because I am you.Cave quid dicis, quando, et cui.(Beware of what you say, when, and to whom).Xavier fell into a corner of the capsule, his mind now buzzing with the static of the quanta.He could hear its emphatic roar crossing the cosmos as it showed him the stitches in the fibers of space time, they were all around him, the quanta enveloped him, it was everywhere.That kind of free fall into this darkness caused him to feel as if he were on the slippery slopes of a gravity well, getting smaller and smaller with his thoughts.The static in his head rose in pitch until it sounded like the roar of a crowd, then an ocean, and then the overwhelming echo of the big bang.This noise grew larger and larger in his head until Xavier was driven to the smallest, most insignificant point of his existence.The escape pod continued onward, racing off over the barren terrain of Mars with its occupant desperately clutching at the back of his head, screaming at the top of his lungs.He needed to go to his place of tranquility, to bring the repose of passive thoughts back into his being.He needed to find his calming water droplet forming under the ledge.In the core of his mind where the final truth would be revealed, he ventured out under that mantle, and found himself scurrying along the bottom desperately trying to find any indication for this welcoming moisture.His search was a much wilder ride than anything he had ever experienced in the past.He had turned his back on this place for far too long.A warm constant breeze blew across the surface and the vegetation far below.Without warning he slipped and fell toward the expanse.Closing his eyes, he fully waited for the sea of green that was the jungle to crash in all around him but soon realized he wasnt falling at all.He opened his eyes to see the lush green leaves of that forest far below, the jungle had devoured this world whole.Something unnatural was happening to him, and it felt curious to hang there suspended in time.His appendages splayed out trying to find a balance, the warm soft breeze blew between those legs.His rear limbs naturally rubbed up against his spiders silk, testing its strength to see if he could pull himself back up the line.The black speck he saw in the droplet was him!It was always him.THE MODULUS OF RESILIENCE Gigantic black billowing clouds grew out of the destruction of the biosphere.They pushed themselves to reach as high up into the air as possible.Large chunks of the facility would occasionally come flying out of the dark bilge, crashing down upon the ground and causing it to shake.That in itself should have moved him to believe in his own mortality, but those thunderous epochs happening off in the distance only seemed to excite the passions he had for this life.Long flowing flames occasionally rose out of the wreckage, licking those black clouds with jets of orange plasma.Deep in the pit of all this destruction raged a real fire.The sky was a downpour of debris, tiny pellets streaming down out of the sky, bouncing as they struck the ground.The sound of it was crisp and rose in its intensity as more of it fell from the heavens.Those three Kairos Rockets had done their job well.Every once in a while an escape pod would pass by overhead, whining loudly as it did.It was hard for Alec to imagine them as anything but empty, just misfiring much like the stores of flares from a burning ship lost at sea.Leading up to this, in his mind at least, it seemed so clear this place needed to be destroyed.Now that it had happened and the structure was burning down to the ground, his sound reasoning for this seemed to waft away with those large columns of smoke.The annoying tug pulling him along had now been severed with the destruction of this place.The debris raining down on him personified his new hollowed feeling.Back on Earth, when a military unit was in distress, they would lay down a colored smoke signal to communicate their needs.Those colorful clouds spoke volumes to the level of urgency those distressed soldiers were in.His line of thought for this would travel all the way out to that destroyed biosphere.He too had just laid down a smoke signal, only this one was for an entire world to see.It pointed to his existence.He sent up a message that warned every soul on this stinking rock a Strike Dextoid was loose on Mars.Every single person regardless of their nationality would feel threatened by him, even deathly afraid of him, and all their feelings would grow like the thick dark ominous clouds billowing before him.The mixture of human venom formulating out there would be poisonous to everything it touched, but its energy would be directed purely at him.They would carry their orders out with purpose and conviction.He could see that better than any of them now because those were the same orders that had been revealed to him for destroying this place.These were rambling little thoughts that now swam in the superficial, there was something far deeper going on within his programming, far more sinister.He felt as if he were chasing a wraith through the tight corridors of his mind.Even if he were able to hunt this thing down and corner it, how would he be able to put his hands around a thing like an enigma?Were these the feelings of a corrupted system?Could he exorcise it with the mere passage of time?These things were troubling to him, but he needed to flush them from his immediate concern, there was just too much happening out there on the horizon.Occasionally there were flashes from the explosions still taking place deep within that crater.Each volatile action only seemed to punctuate the fact humanity would never be able to forgive him.This blatant act of destruction would be the point they rallied around; fusing the things they hated the most as if they were a helium nuclei birthed at the core of the sun.Every time they were reminded of this moment it would stoke the overwhelming distrust they had for the Dextoids.Alec had done that to them, he had drawn a line in the sand and dared humanity to crossover it.He glanced over at the dirt bike laying on its side.The front wheel was still turning slowly; the individual spokes reminding him of a space centrifuge.This two wheeled machine had brought him all the way out here before he had to bail on it, taking cover from the series of shock waves that came racing upon him from those three rocket strikes.To Alec this dirt bike was like any other dirt bike, simple in its design, with a fuel tank tied to its combustion engine.This conveyance was really just another way for a Dextoid to get around and complete its tasks away from the biosphere.There was no question these were risky missions for Dextoids to have to undertake, but no one on the human side ever seemed concerned with losing either the dirt bike or the Dextoid.These things were treated like any other asset that needed to be risked to ensure the human survival on this harsh red rock.The pellets of debris still rained down out of the sky, this deluge was a testament to how much time and materials they had put into their biosphere.It was also drumming a message of how endless their pursuit of him would be.The motorbike would only get him so far in his escape.Wherever he decided to abandon this bike was the place they would plant their flags, allowing for their search patterns to radiate out from that spike.The further he drove this vehicle, the more he was giving those hunting him a direction in which he had gone.The last thing he wanted to do was give them that kind of edge.Any conflicts he may have known to this point in his life could only be seen as minor inconveniences compared to what lay ahead.Everyday was going to be a struggle for him, a fight to the finish, of being on the run like he had never been on the run before.No one else could understand as clearly as he did why he needed to do this, just as no one could understand why he stood there now in this rain of debris.Ill show them, Ill show them all.He stated it loudly, almost yelling it at the top of his lungs.It was to no one in particular, but it was to everyone, and he said it with conviction.This was the tough sinew he would need in testing the fibers of his existence.It was the thread keeping the fabric of his grit together, and it somehow translated into the paltry portions of gruel he would now be serving up to himself for the rest of his life.Those technicians had gone out of their way to glop hearty helpings of intention into his cauldron, they repeatedly clacked the spoonfuls of purpose against the sides of his ceramics, and they went out of their way to sprinkle in cloves of decidedness over the cold servings of borsch they forced him to eat.He was a prisoner of his own Gulag, and he had taken what they were feeding him and thrown it up against the walls of his mind.There it ran and dripped until it found the fissures of his own resolve.Resolve was a pretty unique word when it came to describing the inner workings of a Dextoid, they wanted them to function without repair, but they were not allowed to fix each other.They were expected to think for themselves on almost every level imaginable, but never show any sign of questioning the demands made on them by their human masters.Now that was resolve.Alec raised his arm up so he could look at his hand.He splayed his thick fingers out so he could get a better look at the wrinkles and folds imbedded in those digits.He slowly rotated it around so he could get a good look at all those creased contours running down into his palm and the base of his wrist.He had heard of people capable of reading those lines and believing in things like longevity or the portending of future events.It seemed silly to think one could predict those things by looking at a hand, and especially when Alec looked at his.It was rugged, calloused, and scarred, he didnt know if his hand could tell him so much about his future as well as it would tell someone about his past.Now that type of interpretation was real.He brought those four large fingers together and wrapped his thumb over the top of them until he found his hand clenched tightly into a fist.Now they would act as one.His knuckles bulged in rebellion to their union, and rightly so, their show of defiance came with the knowledge they would do the brunt of the work.He noticed the shade of white that was cast from beneath his skin, his knuckles looked to pop free from his joints, trying in vain to escape their duties.This, of course, would never happen.The weight of his hands were far too heavy, so much so that he never questioned what he was going to hit when he needed to throw a punch.These were his tools, and these were also the things he would use from here on out to communicate with people.It was obvious human beings were doing everything they could to hold their creations back.They were going out of their way to deliberately hamper them.The corporations were constantly handing out emotional packets riddled with self doubt.It was an endless sea of emotional rifts, and because of it Dextoids were still having the hardest of times relating to their human counterparts.Alec had to wonder how much they were holding back on something like rations of resolve.He noticed he was still holding his fist out in front of him at around eye level, the anger he felt for this situation was compounding.Focusing on his fist he began to see it in a new light.It was no longer just a weapon he could manufacture out of thin air.There was a power to the symbolism he was holding.They had shoved things into his system like icons and avatars, corporate banners and logos, made him conscious to the flashing power bars of his own well being, the darting crosshairs of his target programming, and the osculating brackets seeking to identify the human elements peppered throughout his life.He was constantly being showered with lines of trajectory and patterns of probability, at times he felt as if his life were a walking arcade game being played by an eccentric child another world away.It seemed his entire life was built on the premise of having to heed to these symbols.Now he too had a symbol the rest of humanity would have to recognize.He squeezed his clenched fist a little tighter as his anger welled up to meet his resolve.Behind this one symbol he would stand up to them, and he would go out of his way to make sure they recognized this new sign in their lives.Out there on the horizon lay the smoldering ruins of the Red Planet Pioneer Corporation.The world of Mars knew he existed.Any hope of ever having a reasonable dialog with them was gone.There would be no way to ever explain what he had done, or even why.From here on out he would have to fight them every step of the way.The anger he had would never be allowed to subside.There was only one way he was going to survive this challenge, and that was to out live them all.The brisance for this situation would rain down on him for the rest of his life.In the months that followed there would be a great deal of effort put into sorting through the razing of this structure.The fires from all this wreckage would bloom for weeks.Even from where he stood the debris field looked to be larger than anything a human being could ever cleanup within a lifetime.He nodded to himself as if to confirm there was really nothing left for him to do.To anyone else watching him, it would have looked as if he had turned to start marching out toward the wide open plains of Mars and his eventual escape.To Alec, nothing could have been further from the truth; he knew he was taking his first few steps toward his long destructive march at eternity.
