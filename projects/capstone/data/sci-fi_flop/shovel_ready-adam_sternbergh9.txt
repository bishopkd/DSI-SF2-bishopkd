Then stopped himself.Prayed instead.For some kind of release.He heard on Facebook that David and Beth had split up.Saw Beths status changed to single.Started waking up joyful for the first time in months.Put in for a job at his old church.Youth pastor.The Prodigal returns.A fisher of men.His first day back, unpacking books in his new office, Beth and David stopped in to surprise him with a welcome home basket.Warm socks and hot cocoa.His favorite treat, or so she remembered.He used to clutch hot cups of cocoa on the sidelines when the youth group went ice skating at the pond.Watching the two of them skate in lazy circles, oblivious to anyone else.She didnt know it had just been something to hold on to.An excuse to sit it out.Hot cocoa, slowly going cold.He always poured it out into a snowbank when it was time to head home.They handed him the basket.Standing hand in hand.Welcome back.He smiled.We patched things up.He smiled wider.Great news.A smile hed practiced for years and would eventually perfect.He worked with the teens, the youth.Went from Wednesday night volleyball star to referee.Whistle at his lips.Later led the prayers.All the girls formed crushes, naturally.Ray of Sunshine, they called him.Ray of Light.Told him he looked like that guy from the old TV show.The Greatest American Hero.Im no hero, he told them, American or otherwise.The older girls liked to sneak up behind him, finger his curls playfully and in mock wonder, until he brushed them off like horseflies, told them to cut it out.They also liked to linger a little too long in the passenger seat of the car when he gave them rides home.Engine idling.Pregnant moment.Nothing happened.He was pure.An excellent pastor.Hed drop them off and drive home alone.Stay up late reading in the lamplight.But it always found him.Home, at school, back home, it didnt matter.Gripped with lust.He turned out the lamp.One day Beth and David stopped back at his office.Hand in hand.Good news.We got engaged.Later, alone, David asked Mark to be the best man.He said hed be honored, of course.I wouldnt think of asking anyone else.Youre a lucky man.Shes a catch.A year later they stopped by his office again.He looked up from his lesson plan.The story of Bathsheba.What now?Pregnant?No smiles.Beths eyes red.We need to ask your advice.By all means.Have a seat.David was considering a missions trip to Mexico.Mark grimaced.The only news from that region was of drug tensions and body counts.Both rising.Not the safest spot on the globe.David nods.You go where youre called to go.Beth speaks up.Were also talking about starting a family.I see.David shrugs.But that means if Im ever going to go on a missions trip, the time is now.And its only a year.She swats him.Only?Smiling.But nervous.Sick over this.Shes grown into such a beautiful woman.Mark clicks his pen.Recalls school.The nights, mostly.Clicks the pen again.Clickety click.Embossed on the side of the pen: the cross.The old rugged cross.Clickety click.Puts the pen down.Looks David square in the eye.Best friends since childhood.Go.Mark leaned forward.Elbows on knees.Hands gripped to whiteness.Watching the lions.Watching New York.Where he wound up.Confessing to a stranger on cold stone steps.David never even made it to the guesthouse.The flight hit bad weather, got delayed, arrived past dark.They decided to risk it, which was stupid, of course.The stubborn gumption of the faithful, as my grandfather liked to say.Hit a road block.No doubt he tried to convert them, even to the end.Im sorry.Its not a story about temptation at all.Dont you see?Not about lust, or love, but punishment.Gods wrath.How it follows you.When the Lord is displeased.He rubbed his hands like he was trying, and failing, to get warm.Said it like something hed only just remembered.But the thing David had done displeased the Lord.Sounds to me like youre mostly punishing yourself.Look at me.Playing shrink.Well, if thats true, Im doing a terrible job.Thats why I called you.Failed even at that.So what happened with her?Beth?She was crushed, of course.Broken, really.Inconsolable.You didnt try?To comfort her?No.I couldnt even look at her.Not after that.So I ran.But you loved her.He looked at me.Not her.Him.32.I pull off the red ribbon, pocket the box cutter, but dont head inside.Not yet.Theres a place in Hoboken where I like to go to when I need a moment to think.The door says SOCIAL CLUB, but really its just a bunch of old guys playing cards who know how to make you feel unwelcome.My first visit, they shunned me like they were Amish farmers and I was selling electric razors door to door.By visit three, I was getting good at shooting my own withering looks at any hapless strays who happened to stumble in.Its the kind of place where an espresso appears at your elbow without asking and fistfights break out over checkers.Just try opening up a chess board, youll get cuffed upside your brainiac noodle.So after Milgram drops me off, I decide to make a detour.Sit a bit and think about that motorman.Espresso appears.Without asking.I nod a thank you to the waiter.He nods back.Puts down a second cup.Ive never told anyone about this place, not Mark, not Rick, not anyone, so imagine my surprise when Simon the Magician pulls out the chair opposite mine.Chair legs scrape the tile floor with a squeal.Canasta players frown.Simon the Magician.Ta da.He sits down, folds his hands in front of him, and sighs, like hes come to break up with me.Then he opens his hands.You want to go somewhere, get something to eat?Maybe pancakes?Im more of a waffle man.Of course.Well then, let me cut right to it.I know you just met with Milgram.I know what he offered you.Okay.Let me offer something better.Im all ears.You keep the girl.I give you Harrow.I lean in, so as to not be overheard.To be truthful, given what you did to my friend, Im inclined to just come across this table right now and cut your face and keep cutting until I hit something hard.He scratches at his beard.Ah yes.Your friend.Ugly but necessary.Really?Whys that?He gestures between us, like now were connected.You have him, you dont need me.Now you need me.Maybe we should continue this discussion outside.We can do that, sure.But we tried that once and I dont remember it ending too well for you.That was a dream.This is the nuts and bolts world.I do better out here.Simon watches me.His fingertips drumroll the tabletop.Spademan, let me invite you to take the long view for once.Your gizmo buddy is dead.Respiratory issues.Dont be cute.In any case.Hes gone on to his earthly reward.Without him, your whole plan falls apart.You still want Harrow, but you know you wont get within fifty yards of him with anything like a weapon in your hand.And he still wants the girl, and he still has me, and Im still very good at my job.He pauses, rubs his palms together, like hes considering whether or not to betray a confidence.Then he leans in.Voice low.But this is where I can help you.Or I can get up right now and disappear from your life.At least temporarily.Your call.Leans back.Having finished his pitch.I shrug.Truth is, Simon, youre too late.She already bolted.Right after you sent one of your cronies to kill her.My crony?Sure.Turncoat doorman.Hes uptown right now, doing the backstroke in his own blood.Her work, not mine.Simon grins.Backstroke, huh?Maybe more of a dead mans float.Simon pats his pockets.While he does this he says: But I thought you were supposed to protect her, Spademan.Yeah, well, so did she.He pulls a cellphone from his pocket.Lucky for you, I can help you with that too.Tosses the phone on the table.Phone spins like spin the bottle.Stops at me.I watch him.He seems like that rare, enviable man completely content in the world.I feel an angry urge welling up to toss the table aside, I could be on him in a second, Id have a moment or two to leave a permanent mark before he recovered.After that, it would just be animal time, two dumb beasts clawing.No one here would say a word, let alone intervene.These old men have seen worse and kept silent.Thats how they all lived to be so old.But then I think of Mark and temptation.The sword devours one as well as another.Then I think of Persephone.And I ask what I shouldnt ask.So what will it cost?Simons grin upgraded to a smile.What does anything cost?He names his price and just like that, were just two merchants haggling, over spices, over fabrics, over slaves, a scene as old as the world.I have a nest egg.His price isnt the whole thing, but close enough.I have to ask him one more thing, though.What about the motorman?He pauses.Considers.What about him?For starters, does he exist?Sure.Best as I know.Where do I find him?Simon looks me over.Wonders if this is a deal breaker.I wonder the same thing.Settle down, chief.One deal at a time.I want a name, Simon.Forget that.This isnt about that.This is about this.And if there is a time to leave, draw a line, take a stand, this is it.I dont.Instead I say: How do I know I can trust you?He holds his hands out.Nothing up my sleeve.What you did.I dont forgive you.I dont expect that you would.Last question.Why?You familiar with the term simony?No.I do know Judas, though.He sips his coffee.Well, then, you get the drift.Black Judas.Says to me: Do you remember that old game show where they put someone in a plastic booth, turn the fans on, and dollar bills start swirling?You had to grab all the money you could?Sure.I always thought that would be a much more interesting game if they put two people in the booth.Let them fight it out.He backs his chair up.More like life.He stands.Also, Harrow is old.And his empire is vast.And, like nature, I also abhor a vacuum.He reaches out his hand.No more wrecking ball of bone.Just a hand.I want to say deal with the devil, and it is, but thats not all it is.Dumb luck.Sometimes you have to hope it comes when you need it.We shake.Okay, Simon.Now how do I find her?Simon points to the phone.First number on speed dial.And why on earth do you think Persephone would answer a phone call from you?Trust me.Shell pick up.33.This time, she finds me.I get back to my apartment and shes already there waiting, dressed in her hoodie, Docs laced over sweatpants, like a soldier.Chatting with Mark.Seems happy to see me.Hey.Hey.You came back.Yep.And I brought friends.Eight mangy stragglers, refugees from the camps.Hard to tell the boys from the girls.Too much grime and everyones got dreadlocks.I hate dreadlocks.I spot the one guy with the sliced up forehead.I guess he and Persephone patched things up.Theyre all hungry, too, siege starved, havent eaten in a week.Spent the last of their energy dodging nightsticks and paddy wagons.Tossed every trash can they passed for food on their way here, found nothing.There arent a lot of pedestrians in the city anymore.So no trash.No real use for garbagemen.I order a tower of pizzas from the one place in Hoboken that still delivers.Hurricanes, blackouts, bombs spewing toxic waste, you call their number, they never dont answer.I like that.Fresh and hot in twenty minutes.Plus, the name of the joint is the Last Slice.I like that too.My kind of place.While were waiting, one hungry kid wanders off and starts rooting through my barren fridge.Finds nothing but bottled water and waffle batter.So he opens the freezer.Just a Ziploc.Takes it out.Shakes it.Thinks maybe hes found my secret stash.Which he has, sort of.Gropes the baggie.Squeezes the paper wrapped package.Feels four stiff cylinders.Smiles.Dude.This is some serious spliffage.I take the Ziploc from him.Politely.Place it back inside the freezer.Trust me.Its too much for you.Bummer.Close the freezer door sharply while his hand still lingers on the opening.He snatches his hand away.I give him a smile of my own.Tell him.Watch your fingers.Eighteen minutes later.Doorbell.Pizzas here.They have a kind of party, finish off the last of Marks beer.I sit with Persephone.I was worried.Im okay.Dont run away.Dont leave me alone.Fair enough.We sit a minute more, wait for the city to make the next sound.Then she says: So you met Simon.In the flesh.And hell help us?Well see.She reaches out, rubs my arm.I heard about Rick.Im sorry.Thank you.If hes out, does that mean were screwed?Maybe.Maybe not.I may have found us a replacement.Okay.So whats next?Honestly, thats between me and your father.She pulls her hand back.Not exactly.I had a day to think about it.Which I did.And?And I have an idea.Good.Me too.She looks at me.All business.Im pretty sure youll like my idea better.Mark and Persephone escort the gang of carcasses out for a field trip to the riverfront.Fresh air.Sunshine.I tell Mark to maybe throw a few in, for a bath.Truth be told, Id asked for privacy.Miracle of miracles, I got it.I finger the business card.Then call Milgram.She wants to talk to him first.Alone.Naturally.Not here.In there.Why?Shes scared.Understandably.This way is more comfortable for her.She needs to clear the air.We can arrange that.Not a problem.And I want to meet with him.In person.To hand her over.Of course.And I want the motorman.He will be delivered to you.After you deliver her to us.Understood?Yes.Ill deliver her.I hang up.Turn to Mina.White cross of bandage on her forehead.Red cross, etched in blood, seeping through.Black cross, underneath, stitched in sutures.You sure you can do this?Look.I was his girl, not his fucking apprentice.But I do know my way around a bed.And I am plenty fucking motivated, I will tell you that.I hope so.If I wasnt, would I have tracked your ass all the way here?To fucking New Jersey?Skinny Mina.Mina saves the day.Maybe.Mina Machina.34.Sunday.New York Reborn.Madison Square Garden jammed to the rafters, if it still had rafters anymore.A gospel choir kicks it off.A thunderstorm of tambourines.Across the stadium, fifty thousand hands clap in unison.Then a warm up sermon.Opening slot.Light the fire, stoke the brimstone.Local preacher, made good.Then T.  K.  Harrow appears.Angelic.Faintly glowing.Waves left.Waves right.Hosannas rain down.His image wobbles a little, then corrects.He smiles.Hologram.Most know.Few care.All cheer.Im down in the financial district, back at that same abandoned bank.Hike the stone steps and enter.My footfalls echo in the lobby.Farmboy heads me off at the pass.Farmboy is just as good at frisking as I remember.Finds the box cutter in my boot and a pistol besides.My gun.I finally dug it up.He confiscates both.Ushers me in.In Chinatown, Mina in darkness hovers over two beds.Mark in one, Persephone in the other, side by side, like a blood transfusion about to begin.Tubes and wires strung in between.Mina lit by the blue glow of her laptop.Whole thing rigged like shes trying to jumpstart a car thats been dead for a century.Margo the nurse sits behind her, smoking.You sure you can do this?Mina, cranky.You worry about the vital signs.This part I got.Mark and Persephone already gone into the limnosphere.Eyeballs shiver under closed lids.Off to see the wizard.Mina, crankier.This chick is pregnant, you know.I know.So you shouldnt smoke.Margo blows fumes out her nose like a bull about to charge.Dont worry.Its okay.Im a nurse.In the dream.Persephone, alone.Barefoot.Shes dressed in her baptismal dress.Fathers favorite.Floral pattern.Matches the pastures that stretch out on either side of the path before her.The cobblestones cool underfoot.Radiant.Catch the sun and amplify it back at her.She squints.Wow, he wasnt kidding.Paved with gold.Milgram greets me with a handshake like Im here to apply for a loan.His smile tells me Im not going to get it.Mr Harrow will be with us shortly.Hes just finishing up his meeting.With her.Hopefully all will go well.No worries.I can wait.Between here, heaven, and Madison Square Garden, Mr Harrow is a busy man today.The frisking farmboy is joined by three more farmboys.Muscles bulge under shirts.Guns bulge under jackets.They form a loose semicircle around me and Milgram, like hes the cowboy and Im a skittish calf that might bolt.The frisking farmboy hovers directly behind me like hes daydreaming of all the different parts of me he could break, once hes given the go ahead.Milgram folds his arms.And they say you cant be everywhere at once.I shrug.Miracles of the modern world.Milgram nods.Indeed.Margo, still smoking.Having cracked pack number two.That cut on your forehead looks nasty.You get that looked at?Its fine.Mina stroking, then coaxing, then cursing her keyboard.Mutters.Now where did you get to?What happened?Seriously, I need quiet right now.Long suck on a cigarette.Paper sizzles.You didnt lose her, did you?Somewhere in there?No.No?No.I didnt.Okay, good.Mina scours the screen.Not her.Him.She follows the path through the pasture.Butterflies flutter and land on her softly.The path ends at a temple.End of the yellow brick road.The temple is columned, like in Roman times.Or someones idea of Roman times.She climbs the stairs to the towering oaken doors.Each one as tall as a building in its own right.Round iron knockers, big as hula hoops, for giants, she guesses.The rest of the temple made of gold.Two farmboys, strapping lads, stand sentry.Dressed as centurions.They stay silent.The doors swing open.Inside, a courtyard.Statues.Fountains.At the far end, a throne.Her father stands.Milgram kills time by giving me a tour, like were in a museum.At one time, banks were thought of almost like churches.I mean, look at this structure.Its magnificent.The painting on the ceiling alone would have taken months to complete.And the vault.Breathtaking, no?A kind of holy of holies in its own right.Its sad to think its all moved online now.Data zipping hither and yon.All so ephemeral.Nothing left to stain your fingers with.While he prattles I think of what Persephone told me.About the dream.About Paved With Gold.About Rachel.Milgram was the mastermind.You look beautiful, Grace.Her father, in a rippling white robe.Majestic.Imperial.Laurel wreath on his brow.His obsession with emperors.He can name the succession by heart.Augustus.Tiberius.Caligula.Claudius.So much for the footsteps of the humble carpenter, huh, Dad?I know its all a bit over the top, Grace.But you know, render unto Caesar and so on.And dont forget, this is heaven.Or as close as most people will ever get.And when we all get to heaven, we do want it to look a little bit like heaven.He descends the few stairs that lead down from the throne.I was so worried about you.Really?Dont ever run away from me again.I didnt think I was safe with you.Well, we have a mutual interest in your safety now, dont we?He reaches out to touch her belly.She bats his hand away.Maternal instinct.He smiles.Why do I have to learn about these things from other people, Grace?It leads to all sorts of misunderstandings.But you should have known Id never let a grandchild of mine come to harm.Whatever his provenance.He reaches out.Grazes her cheek with a knuckle.She flinches.Cant help it.But she hates that she flinches.His hand flush on her cheek now.Welcome home.Brushes a curl back from her forehead.His knuckle on her skin.Her skin against his knuckle.She knows that touch.As real as real.Milgram developed the technology.He was convinced there was a way to make off body even better.When you tap in, youre in a computer construct.Could be open to anyone, could be limited access, or could be something private by request.You might go in alone, you might bring a few friends who tap in by your invitation.Medieval feast, a sultans harem, Old West cathouse, whatever.But everything else besides you in that world, the horses, the harem girls, the frontier whores, the beds, the feast, the clothes, the props, theyre all part of the construct.Just the computer filling in the blanks.Take the farmboys back at the country church.Me, Harrow, Simon, Mark, were all people, comatose in our beds somewhere.The farmboys were computer code.Just part of the program, like the pews.So if a farmboy hits me, I feel pain, because Im a real person.And if I hit a farmboy, the punch feels plenty real to me, but the farmboy only simulates a pain reaction.Its the computers best guess at pain.The best guess, for most people, is convincing enough.But not for everyone.Mina spits on her laptop.Cheap Chinese piece of shit.Marks eyes jitterbug under his lids, like theyre searching for the exit.Margo cant tell if hes dreaming or drowning.I thought you said you piggyback people all the time.Not all the time.Sometimes.So whats the problem?Theres no problem.Margo stubs out her butt.Im bringing him up.Give me a second.Both bony hands now free of the keyboard, Mina clutches instead at her wild witchs nest of black hair.Goddammit.Where are you?I thought he was riding in with her?You know, like a skateboarder grabbing a bus?Thats what you said, right?Yes.So where is he?I think he let go of the bus.There is a certain kind of off body customer who wants to, say, humiliate someone sexually.Harbors a dark rape fantasy.Fuck you with a knife to your throat, get off on your screams, that kind of shit.Fear and pain as aphrodisiacs.Brands, whips, blades, etcetera.If you can think it, someones already thought it and done it.And someone else watched it.And someone else heard about it and wanted to go and do likewise.In fact, one of the whispered selling points of the limnosphere, at first, was that it would let people like that burn off that sick energy.At first.Problem is, to that kind of person, the computers best guess was never quite good enough.So that was the first thing Milgram figured out.The other thing he figured out was something no one else had thought of.Or if theyd thought it, they didnt put it into practice.They didnt dare.He figured out that it makes a difference to have a real person on the other end.A real person reacting to you.Giving you feedback.Take Mary and Magdalene, the church twins.The heart of Harrows big demonstration.The first one, Mary, was just the computers idea of a girl.The computers idea of a downy cheek.The computers idea of a blush.The second one, Magdalene, was a real girl, tapped into a bed somewhere, feeling everything on the other end.Reacting to my touch.So, too, was my wife.My Stella.Someone was playing her part.Feeling my hands on her face somewhere.Feeling my kiss.Its the only way to make it feel that real.So what Milgram figured out was that you can tap people in, doesnt matter who they are, what they look like out here, once theyre off body you can basically pour them into an empty vessel in the construct, use them as you will.And once theyre tapped in, theyre prisoners.They cant tap out and they cant control or even interact with the construct.They just provide the feedback.The emotional underpinnings to the simulation.Give it that extra juice that only comes from real pleasure.Or real pain.Bigger market for that second one, it turns out.That was Milgrams innovation.New wine, old bottles, that sort of thing, except in this case, its the other way around.Old wine.New bottles.Bottles made to be broken.So what you do is, you conjure up a made to order nightmare.Then cast these people as unwitting extras.Or, in some cases, as the star.Rachel was a star.Milgrams tour is done.Now were just waiting.Milgram tries to grin, winces, bobs on the balls of his feet.Like were two businessmen at a convention, waiting for an elevator.I pipe up.I want to see him.He should be with us momentarily.No.I want to see him now.See that hes actually here.But hes in his bed.He wont want to be disturbed.Dont worry.I wont wake him up.Scouts honor.Milgram glances at his farmboys.All right.Follow me.Nods his head at Farmboy Number One.The frisky one.You too.And he leads us both to the back of the bank.To the vault.
