A small smile played around his lips.Yes.But you wont tell me their names?They wouldnt mean anything to you.But they do to you?Yes.You warned me on the way over.You said not to promise too much.What did you mean?They will use you if you let them, and they wont care if they use you up.Dayn filled the ferry with laughter.Really.And youre not using her?Naveen stiffened.Im giving her fair return.Dayn said, Shouldnt we get more as her audience is going up?They were at it again.Ruby held up her hands.Dont fight.Youre probably both right.She glanced at Dayn.We wouldnt be out here without Naveen.She looked at Naveen.You are getting rich off of me.Ill finish these four concerts at the rates we agreed on, but I want more after that.And what will you do to earn extra?Can I get you to start commenting and working on our communication nets?Hed been after her for that for a long time.I cant.I need time to write songs.Youre stubborn.Im tired.Ruby yawned, as if finally released from the tension of the rather odd breakfast.Dayn put an arm around her and she leaned into him.The last thing she heard was Naveen mumbling, Maybe we need a medical bot today.74     Onor and Marcelle shared a table at the far end of the bar.Marcelle sipped fizzy water with a hint of fruit in it, and watched him contemplatively.What are you trying to figure out?he asked her.If youre happy.Pregnancy had changed her.He loved this Marcelle better than the younger version hed known, although it was a mystery to him how such a natural process could make a woman so much more centered on emotions.If she had cared about feelings before, she hadnt shown it.When they were teenagers, shed teased him relentlessly.These days, he often felt unsure about how to react to her so he just said, Im worried.We should have heard from Haric.Im worried, too, she whispered.About almost everything.He reached across the table and cupped her face.She was so thin her cheekbones rose like ridges under his fingers, as if the baby was eating everything she put into her system.Dont worry about the things you cant control, anyway.And you can control what happens to Haric?I might be able to do something about it.A frown creased her forehead.I knew you were thinking of leaving.At least she didnt object.Not that hed call the tone he heard in her voice happy.Haric would come to save any of us.Marcelle pointed toward the door he had been trying to watch.Is that the couple youre looking for?He turned to see the tall woman and the shorter man inside the doorway, looking around.Yes.Send Joel a message?She bent to her slate.He held up a hand and waved.They came over and sat, and Onor introduced Marcelle.Once more the man and woman remained anonymous.Onor looked at them and said, Why dont you just make up names?Misrepresenting yourself is illegal here, the woman said.We need your help, Onor said.They looked curious but waited for him to speak.We have ...something Naveen helped us with.A situation.He was having trouble with words.Fear that a situation Koren already knew about would backfire?We have two AIs sharing a single webling.It was the only place we had for them.We want to separate them, so one of them can be carried with us.Can you help us set that up?The mans eyes had narrowed.It could be risky.Why is it important?Theyd asked about exposing Koren, and they needed Ix to help with that, and this would protect Ix.We ...it will help with what you want us to do.To expose Koren.The man stared at him for a long time, measuring.I can call someone.He stepped away from the table, touched his slate and then his ear, and in a moment he was talking in tones too hushed for Onor to hear.What would you like?Onor asked as he called Evie over.She gave a mute look that implied desperation and he shrugged to let her know that he had no word from Haric.Evie looked as if Harics absence had scraped something vital from her, but she turned away with their orders.Perhaps their relationship was more intense than he had thought.Joel appeared, making a hole through the crowded floor by moving chairs aside to get SueAnnes wheelchair through.They sat down and greeted the woman, accepting her return smile.Allen noticed them and came over.As soon as the man finished with his phone call, he sat back down.Ruby says hello.You saw her?Onor asked.How is she?Marcelle asked.Joel leaned in.When did you see her?Recently.Shes okay, but she looks weak.Who was with her?Joel asked.Dayn.Joels eyes narrowed.Not KJ?Have you seen KJ?We know who he is.He was off proofing the next place Ruby is supposed to sing.Joel sat back, brow furrowed.What do you mean, weak?She says shes just tired.That she misses you and will see you soon.I want her home.Were not in control of that, the man said.But we did order up a medical bot examination for her.Marcelle leaned in, clearly interested.What can a medical bot do?Im in charge of medical here, and we have some of our own from the Fire, but all they do is help lift people or help with simple surgeries.They cant tell, for example, why someone is tired.The man answered Marcelle.The kind of bot we ordered her time with should be able to tell that for Ruby.Can I see one?Can you send one here?You can order one, the man said.Ill see that someone sends you information.Thank you.Marcelle put a hand over her belly, and he saw it jump slightly as the baby kicked.SueAnne frowned.What will that cost us?Were paying for Rubys exam.We have another thing to talk about, Onor said.We sent someone out to look for cargo, like you asked us to, and they seem to have disappeared.You sent one person out?Onor nodded.We heard Koren knows youre looking.She found Ruby at a party and told her to tell you to stop it.Onor sat back, suddenly worried.So theyre both in danger.I want her home, Joel repeated.Marcelle was stroking her stomach, as if danger to Ruby meant danger to their child.You got from her to us in one day.Can we go?Joel asked.We can pay you.SueAnne glanced at Joel with a sour look on her face but Joel ignored her.Maybe.But first we need to find the person you sent for proof.Theyre in immediate danger.Ill go, Onor said.I sent him.Who do you want to take with you?One of the dancers?Chitt?No.The Jackman.Joel frowned.Really?What about Chitt?Marcelle spoke.The Jackman loves Onor like a son, and hes smart.Onor glanced at the man.We need to move the AI first.Its as good as done.Onor waited in the bar for The Jackman, Marcelle yet again beside him.It had taken three hours to prepare, and Marcelle looked exhausted.You should go lie down.I might not see you again.Of course you will.You dont know that.She didnt flinch or turn away.Evie plopped down at the table.She wasnt wearing her waitressing uniform.Onor blinked at her.Youre not going.Try to stop me, Evie replied calmly.Haric wouldnt want you to go, he told her.The Jackman elbowed his way through the door.Onor picked up his pack.Aleesi hadnt exactly been copied, but a secure connection to the webling existed in a two inch by two inch wafer in his pocket, and he had a fistful of small round nubs made to fit inside ears.Evie stood.Onor opened his mouth to tell her no, but Marcelle put a hand on his arm and gave him a look hed come to dread.I would go if it was you.Onor glanced at The Jackman.He shrugged.If it were Marcelle or Ruby we wouldnt be able to say no.I bet Evie wont listen to us either.Youre getting soft, old man, Onor said.We might need her help.Evie practically glowed.Onor leaned down to hold Marcelle, and she whispered in his ear.I love you.I love you, too, he said.Dont have that baby until I get back.Then you had best hurry.75     The day after the odd breakfast, and only two hours before Rubys next concert, Ruby and Jali stood in the dressing room, laughing.Jalis fingers flew through Rubys hair, braiding in long strings of shiny thread that would look a tiny bit like flames under the stage lights.They had left the door open.KJ came in, leading a silvery beast that looked as shiny and malleable as the ones they had first seen on the Fire.Its not from Koren?Jali asked.Theres a note from Satyana.She says its in appreciation for your help.A bribe?KJ shook his head.I doubt she can force you into anything.I would like to see the bot in action.Ruby stared at him for a long moment, fear rising in her throat for no good reason.She was fine.Put it in the corner and Ill mess with it after the show.You only have it for an hour, he said.She and Jali looked at each other, and Jali sighed.I can do fewer ribbons than I planned.Give me five minutes to adjust the design.KJ gave Jali such a stern look that she took a step back from Ruby.Ill finish as soon as its done.The robot looked at Ruby.Strip please.The robot sounded human and female, almost like SueAnne.Ruby stared at KJ.He backed out of room.Ill be right out here.And dont let Dayn in either.Jali stayed, glaring at the machine as Ruby stripped.She felt far more vulnerable naked in front of the silver doctor than she ever had in front of a man.We dont have time for this.Ruby struggled not to grab her clothes and throw them back on.After all, she could reach her clothes.The room was small.I dont even know how to send it away, Jali whispered.Ruby still wasnt completely sure she should trust Satyana.Or anybody for that matter.But she had to trust someone.Shed done it with Naveen.The robot reached for her arm with more dexterity than she expected, although to be fair it could probably do surgery.Its grip was cool and slippery.It was also too firm and precise for her hand to actually slide free when she tested it.Hold still, it told her.Its other hand came up, not in a gripping shape but rounded.A needle poked free and slid smoothly into her arm, blood flowing almost immediately and faster than Ruby wanted.The robot doctor seemed very capable.The part of Ruby that used to repair robots wanted to know how it worked.Stand still.It made a slight whirring sound as it snipped a tiny bit of her hair, and then it scraped some skin from her hip with a cold metal blade.At that she moved away, just be to be told again to Stand still.Jaliet braced her, and she gritted her teeth and let it keep touching her, once behind her knees, once at the wrist.Then it withdrew and said, Stand away, which could only have been a command for Jali.Close your eyes.Ruby obeyed.You too, it said to Jali.Ruby forced herself to take a deep breath and trust.She heard a hum, and a faint warmth passed from her head to her toes.You may get dressed again.Ruby opened her eyes to find that the robot had changed shape and was parked against a wall, ignoring them.Lets just put on your clothes for tonight, Jali said.Ruby tugged her underwear up and fastened her bra before saying, Yes.She felt better just for being that covered.Jali went right back to finishing Rubys hair, her fingers pulling tight across Rubys scalp from time to time.She tugged hard enough to apologize twice, a sign that she was as disconcerted by the machine as Ruby.Jali poured a blue gray dress with colored fringe over Rubys head and tugged it in at the waist with a cinched strap.She used the small Fire pin to hold a flame colored scarf across Rubys shoulders.Jali herself wore the other one, and the third had been given to KJ.Ruby kept glancing at the machine.Surely the hour had passed.It made her feel fretful.Is it a bad sign that its been here so long?I doubt it.I think so, Ruby replied.Maybe its in awe of you.She shook her head.A small part of her had been afraid of her weakness for a long time, had been hiding it from herself as much as from Joel and Jali and KJ and Onor and everybody else.Its almost time to go on.The expected knock came on the door.Coming!Jali called.She snatched up a brush for last minute touches and took Rubys hand.Lets go.The door opened to reveal Satyana instead of the stage hand.76     Onor sat next to Evie on the train.Her dark hair reminded him of Marcelles, but otherwise she was less angular than Marcelle and even thinner.The look on her face drove out any sense she might be fragile, though.In fact, she looked so intense he felt glad she was with them.He glanced around the slightly swaying car.Two men were deep in conversation near the front.A robot sat three seats away, its only movement to rock with the train.A pretty woman wearing a deep red jumpsuit snored two seats behind him, blue hair hiding half of her face.No one paid any obvious attention to them.Onor dug into his pocket and pulled out three of the small round objects the technician had handed to him.He handed two to Evie and watched her pass one to The Jackman.He spoke softly.Put those in your ear.Theyre called earbugs.Then we can talk to Aleesi.The Jackman narrowed his eyes.We need her.Thats how we even knew what train to take.What else do we need to know?The Jackman stared at the earbug, making no move to bring it near his ear.Didnt you write down where we get off the train?The Jackman always accepted new things slower than most.We need Aleesi.Think of having her help as a silver lining for getting attacked.I dont like it.We do need her.Or some AI.Everyone around us knows more than we do.Which ear?Evie asked.Onor shrugged.Evie lifted her right hand and tucked a black curl behind her ear.She showed him an empty hand, and then her face screwed up in an odd way.Are you okay?She said Yes, but her face stayed so tight she looked like she was in pain.The Jackman shook his head ever so slightly.A refusal.Onor leaned his head onto his hand, trying to look natural in case the robot actually was watching them.He used his index finger and his thumb to push the earbug into his ear canal.It burrowed, warmed, and seemed to spread out.It felt alive.Nothing had ever moved so deep in his ear, and for a second he wondered if it was going to pop his eardrum.Even though it didnt actually hurt, it felt strange enough that he understood the look on Evies face.I was wondering if you were ever going to talk to me.He whispered as softly as he could.Hi, Aleesi.You dont have to make any noise at all.Just think youre talking.What?He could still hear the word.He tried again.Like this?Yes.Evies voice, only in his ear and not from beside him at all.She wasnt even looking at him; her head was turned toward The Jackman.Yes.Shes got it, Aleesi said.Try again.You dont even have to form the words.He glanced over at the Jackman, who still had his fist closed over the earbug.Do it, he said out loud.Thats worse, Aleesi said into his ear.Softer.Damned machine, he thought.Better.He laughed.The train stopped, and the doors opened automatically.No one got on or off.The Jackman still looked dubious.But then, he hadnt spent any time with Aleesi.If Aleesi hadnt started out chasing Onor with intent to kill, he might actually like her.She felt more human than Ix ever had.It took almost half an hour for all three of them to be able to talk to each other and to Aleesi.He subvocalized the way Aleesi had taught him.This is like on the Fire, when we could all talk to Ix, only then we had to speak out loud.You can still talk to me.Ixs voice.Through Aleesi.Onor hadnt realized it would work like that.Thats great.Can Ix talk to its copies?Ix answered.I cannot.Ix is old, Aleesi elaborated.It wasnt designed to do that.So lets get on with restoring your riches.The Jackman spoke, loud enough Onor could hear his whisper as well as the sound of his voice amplified through the earbug.Why do you care?I dont like the way that youve been treated.Koren should not have been able to get away with what she did.Out on the Edge, we have morals.And your morals are why you attacked us?The Jackman said, again too loud.Subvocalize, Aleesi said.The only way that my masters at the Edge can get new resources is to capture them.Were forbidden to go into the inner system.If they opened trade, we wouldnt be pirates.The Jackman made no response, although Onor had the feeling he was intensely uncomfortable.Evie spoke.Didnt your masters capture you?The usual captures were asteroids or comets or derelict ships.Lets get on with this.Exchange Four is bigger than Exchange Five: in addition to nearby habs, it serves one of the main ports where ships bring goods into and out of the Deep.The Jackman said, Okay.Ive downloaded a map to all of your slates.Ive noted the places Haric stopped and the people he talked to.I recommend that you start with the last people he saw before he disappeared.Ix and I will send information to your slates as we get it.Im going to be watching you, so if whatever happened to Haric happens to you, I may be able to record it.How are you going to watch us out here?The Jackman asked.There are open cameras throughout the exchanges that any AI can access.Just AIs?The Jackman looked unhappy.Not people?It would take you seven point three days to watch the combined video from five minutes of all of the cameras through Exchange Four.Evie leaned forward, looking excited.Can you show me the video you have of Haric?Ive put it on your slate.So, what is Ix doing to catch Koren?Its studying the Deeping Rules.So what should we do now?Im watching video, Evie said.And she was, one earphone dangling against her chest and the other in her left ear, so she had one for the AI and one for the video.Ill look at the layout of Exchange Four, The Jackman offered, pulling his slate out of his pocket.Onor sat back, the train seat digging against his shoulders.The blue haired woman still snored behind him, the robot still appeared asleep, and the two men had stopped talking.One was absorbed in his slate and the other appeared to be listening intently to something.Even though absolutely no one was looking at them, Onor couldnt shake the idea that they were being watched.77     Satyana stood in the doorway, her unnaturally blue eyes staring from Ruby to the medical robot and back again.Fury tightened her jaw so sharply that Ruby took a step back.She pressed into Jali who murmured, Easy.Sit down, Satyana said.I have to go sing.Really.Its time.Whatever information kept the robot here and brought Satyana had to be cruel.If youve got bad news, you can tell me after the concert.Satyana kept looking at Ruby as she said, Jali.Go tell Naveen shell be a few minutes late.Jali put a hand on Rubys back, as if holding her up.I want to stay.Satyana shook her head.Jali looked at Ruby, who nodded.Ill tell you what she says.Jali stepped away, slowly, and then hesitated again by the door, looking back.Go on, Ruby said.Keep Naveen out of here until I come out.Hes not going to like me being late.The look of betrayal on Jalis face was almost enough for Ruby to call her back in.She would have, except for the stoic, barely contained anger that sat on Satyana like a curse word.As soon as the door closed behind Jali, Ruby snapped What?How long have you been sick?Im just tired.Satyana stared at her, unmoving.Unyielding.I cant stop here.If I stop, people will starve.Youre almost dead.Ruby blinked at her, a sudden wave of shivers running up her spine and goose bumps rising on her arms.She stood up.Im not.How much weight have you lost?I dont know.Has Jali had to take in clothes?Make them smaller?Almost everythings new.She heard the childishness of her words, but there wasnt anything else she could do.She was fine.She had to be.Everyone needed her.Are you nauseous?Sometimes.When was the last time you felt well?Before we got here.Are there other people sick?Ruby hadnt asked Marcelle for an update in the last week or so before she left.Shed been caught up in finances and clothes and getting ready, in Aleesi and Ix, and a thousand other things.Yes.Some.A few died.Early.We thought it was just from being here.Koren tested us all when she came, but maybe she missed the babies.Her damned robot.Looked just like the one you sent.Maybe it was the one you sent.But then Satyana hadnt been there, not on the ship.Anyway, most people are getting better.She was babbling.Satyana spoke slowly, as if that were the only way Ruby might hear her.You need treatment.It probably wont save you.Maybe nothing can save you now.Ruby sat and breathed, hard and ragged.Satyana sat in the one extra chair that was there.Im mad at the whole damned universe.I need you, and you need me.The two of us are enough to make change.She sat forward, looking closely at Ruby, placing a hand on her shoulder.You have to get better.The robot says you cant, but youve done other impossible things.Ruby sat and stared at her for a moment.She needed to go.Naveen wasnt going to wait forever, and there was an audience out there.What did the robot tell you I have?An allergy.A deep one.We call it the Death of Hope.The Death of Hope?How could anyone name something that badly?There are things we put in our food to keep us young.Thats probably what Koren was testing you for reactions to.When we first started with this, some people died.Not many.But after the first generation, no one died.We thought it was gone, forever.Its like cancer, which used to kill us but doesnt any more.The Death of Hope makes you thin and it steals your energy and grows things inside you that kill you.But then, some cancers were like this; caused by things that were meant to do good.Our people die of cancer, Ruby said.Some of the old.We know enough to find it in the young, though.If I got it now, Id live.Satyana shook her head.What if I dont eat any more of your food?What if I go away?That would have worked if youd known before you came to live here.Its too deep now.By the time the Death of Hope shows upby the time it steals your energy, its really, really hard to fix.Well try.Well try very hard.Rubys thoughts seemed to batter against a ball of pain that she couldnt let come up yet.It felt so sharp it seemed to be physical, even though shed just been giggling with Jali.She had been feeling better than she had been for a few days.But now ...now there was a monster inside her that might come out and steal her joy, her strength.Some of our children lived through it.I dont remember the details, but Marcelle could tell you.She wanted to clutch her stomach but she didnt let herself.What about the adults?Ruby shook her head.I dont know.I have to sing.Im going to sing and then were going to talk about this.Jali is going to be with me.Shes not sick?Satyana asked.No.Ruby shook her head.No, shes always been thin.Ill have the robot test her.There was no time to think about any of this now.Listen to me sing.She could barely talk without collapsing.She stood up and stretched and breathed.I have to sing before I think about this.Satyana whispered, Im sorry.Itll be a good concert.Ruby held her hand out to Satyana.Come listen from backstage.But dont tell Naveen.Not yet.Satyana shook her head.I have something else to do.Good luck.What happens next?The bot stays with you and it starts treatments.Ruby forced her hands not to shake.Will it hurt?Satyana offered a small smile.You already hurt.She leaned in and gave Ruby a hug.Her arms were strong and she smelled like cinnamon and stim.Go.Ruby went.78     Exchange Four felt twice as big as Exchange Five.Spaceship crews wandered here and there, some with clear purpose and some gawking.Onor saw children and families and even a few people that looked old.They passed the job market, which was still half open.Holographic pictures of spaceships spun above the aisles with open positions scrolling through the air under them.Onor leaned over to Evie and whispered in her ear.We should remember this.There may be a day we need to get off the Deep.Id love to get out of here.Her gaze kept sweeping the crowd as if she could force Haric to emerge.The Jackman stared at his slate, trying to orient it to the rows of booths.The Exchange felt so confusing that Onor was glad of Aleesis voice in his ear, saying, Fourth booth on the left.Haric stopped and looked on his way in.Come back later though.First, find the last place.The Jackman has it as a bright yellow dot.Whats the fastest way to get there?Let The Jackman lead you.It will give him a focus and you need to learn your way around.Yet another thing he liked about her; she taught them instead of telling them.Ix had been terrible at that.Onor glanced at the booth Aleesi had told them to come back to.Pendants shone and sparkled in artificial light, gold chains draped over leather bolsters, and at least three groups of customers eyed the merchandise.Evie pulled toward it, but Onor took her small hand in his.Stay close.I dont want to lose you.Aleesi can help us find each other, Evie hissed.And if I lose you, Haric will kill me after we find him.She glared at him and pulled her hand free, but she stayed near him.Why are there so many more people here than at home?Onor subvocalized.Many are from visiting spaceships.The Deep is known for its shopping.People can buy everything from starship fuel to food to baubles they have no possible need for at the Exchanges of the Deep.It took thirty minutes and two wrong turns to find the booth Aleesi was sending them to.At least twice, Onor became briefly convinced that they were being followed, but then the suspected follower turned away from them.When the Jackman looked up and said, Were there, Onor and Evie stopped beside him and the three of them looked the booth over.Its not what I expected, Onor said.The booth sold animals.Or more correctly, animal DNA, animal fetuses, and animals designed for specific purposes.A large, hoofed animal with a doleful face pulled a plow in one picture, a small cat like animal sat on a mans shoulder, looking ready to leap off and protect him, and a variety of small and fluffy beasts in an even bigger variety of colors followed children or cuddled with them on couches.A man stood behind the booth, feet planted, watching a small throng of customers.A few were children, apparently thoroughly engaged in looking through the entire catalog.Evie approached the booth, The Jackman and Onor right behind her.They stood behind the children, watching the catalog swing by.Onor subvocalized, I should have been more interested in the cargo.I wouldnt know if any of these came from the Fire.Ix is watching.Does it know?Onor asked.I didnt think Naveen had copied all of its memories.It has many fragments of the Fires manifest.Onor felt the weight of the things he didnt understand.A tall woman wearing an open pressure suit and comfortable shoes that didnt match it called two children back to her and walked away, leaving the booth momentarily empty of customers.Evie stepped up to the man, who offered a salesmans broad smile.What can I do for you?Evie held up her slate and showed him a picture of Haric.Have you seen this man?A slight, dark look passed across the mans face as his smile transformed to a blank look.No, I have not seen him.Evie brought up a video clip of Haric standing in front of the booth.Onor winced.I cannot be expected to recall all of my customers.He inclined his head.May I show you anything?Onor stepped in.Were interested in anything new.Perhaps items youve only had in your catalog for a few months?The man smiled.He pulled up a picture of a cat like creature with white fur.Perhaps like this?Its a new mutation of our best selling childrens pet for spaceships.It trains easily and can take cold sleep.Onor shook his head and said, Thank you.The man wasnt going to show them anything, and now theyd announced their presence to everyone.He had expected Evie to do better, but he hadnt remembered how young she was.He tugged on her arm, pulling her away from the booth.The Jackman followed, the look on his face sour.As soon as they were out of earshot, he leaned down toward Evie.Dont tell them what you want.She turned to face him.Then how will we find anything out?Build trust first and try to wheedle clues out of people.That will take forever.The Jackman sighed.Better that than alerting your quarry with direct requests.Theyve no reason to trust us.Or we them, she shot back.But were the ones who need something they have.Evie looked daggers at The Jackman, but she nodded.They learned nothing more at the next five booths.After the fifth boothone that sold rare minerals in large and expensive lots, The Jackman suggested, Lets take a break and stop for something to eat.Evie had taken to staring at the ground.I dont want to stop.I want to find Haric.Onor said, I need fuel to keep going.Besides, The Jackman said, Its dinnertime.Maybe we can find a place playing Rubys concert.That means the Exchange is going to close soon.Evie looked depleted.Where is the closest food?Onor asked Aleesi.A few beats of silence passed before she answered, long enough for Onor to realize he hadnt actually heard from the robot spider girl for some time.I have news.Yes?Evie slipped up and spoke out loud.Haric is in the Brawl.He was checked in two hours ago.The Jackman cursed out loud and then muttered, For what?For being here without permission.No one from the Fire is cleared for this section of the ship.I didnt know that, Onor said.No one ever told you.It may be something you can use against Koren.Another thing, Onor muttered.The Jackman looked alarmed.That means its not legal for us to be here.Who cares, Evie said.Dont we want to get caught?Then well be with Haric.I can tell people where you are, Aleesi said.Why hasnt anyone caught us yet?Onor mused.They dont think you know anything, Aleesi said.So they think Haric does?Weve got to go, Onor said.We can check into the Brawl, right?Evie looked hopeful and The Jackman shook his head.She frowned at the older man.Its better than getting thrown in.Onor stiffened.Hes not going to be easy to find in there.We have to look!The Jackman said, Im not going.Evie looked aghast.Why not?Someones got to stay free to pull you out.Besides, I need to tell the others.Aleesi will tell people, she said.The Jackman just looked at her and shook his head.Onor looked at Evies desperate face and said, Ill go.Lets buy something to eat.We dont have time.Youre not going to be able to get food later.He took her arm, pulling her gently toward the food aisles.She resisted him, and then gave in with a disapproving sigh.Behind them, The Jackman muttered, Fools and children.Youll get yourselves killed.79     Ruby stood at the edge of the stage and stared out at the crowd.She tried to drink in their energy, to fill with it so she could burst into voice and give it back to the people who had come to hear her.There was nothing.No, that wasnt right.It almost felt like a wall stood between her and them.She took a deep breath and held her hands together in front of her.She lifted her head.Good evening.A few polite claps.Im sorry I was late.Ive just heard that there ...there may ...maybe I will have to learn some new things.But now, Im going to sing for you.This evening, Im going to start with something simple.A lullaby.This is what we sang to the babies who fretted at night, and sometimes to the old as they neared the end of their lives.Her stomach still hurt, but she told herself it was imaginary.Pain was the past, it might even be the future.But it could not be now.It helped.A little.She opened her mouth and started singing.Singing the lullaby drove the soft words and the comfort that she had to send into her voice through her whole body, soothing away a layer of fear.Underneath the fear, anger bubbled.After the lullaby swelled to its slow end, Ruby stepped as close to the edge of the stage as she dared.The song had cracked the wall between her and the audience, giving her back a sense of them.They wanted something stronger and deeper.Now that weve calmed down, are we ready to wake up?A faint chorus of yes and yes and sure tickled her ears.Thats not enough.Are you ready?Yes!Really ready?Yes!Then lets have a night of revolution!She moved into The Owls Song.The audience went with her, singing the chorus, standing on their feet.She didnt take a break.She sang every song shed ever written, from beginning to end.She saved the Brawl song for last.She prepped them for it.Ready to Brawl!Ready!Ready to change!Ready!Ready for the song!Ready!She had kept her anger through all of the songs, the anger mixed up with the pain in her stomach.It had driven her past and through her exhaustion.As she prepared to start the Brawl song, she felt anger thicken her spine, felt it in her feet and the top of her head, as if the anger flowed in and through her and out into the hall, a raw arc of emotion between her and the people watching her.Her anger at the universe for making her sick, her anger at Satyana for telling her, at the robot for finding it, at herself for not seeing it, for not knowing.She let her anger at the whole mess ride inside of her and she threw the feeling into the words.As the song poured out of her, the anger went into it, imbuing her voice, hollowing her out.She sang eight verses of the song.Four of them were verses no one had heard.The last one was a verse she hadnt even thought of, a sound that flowed out of her and carried tears with it, so she stood and emptied herself and tears flew down her face and joined the drops of sweat that salted the stage under her feet.The singer grows ever Weaker Locks her loss and love Inside and sings Her death Sings the losses Of all her parents And theirs, locked In the memories Of families, Lost From the joy of life Time passes.She is going now, going Down into the dark Before her own people, Before her love Before the Fire The audience made no sound.She heard her steps, her breath, her words, her tears falling onto the stage.She let the right three beats fall and then held her arms up toward the sky as she started the chorus.Look inside See despair The audience joined her.A hundred voices, then a thousand, then more.Starve it out Embrace the hope Of helping The lovers of our hearts The sound of all of the joined voices filled the room full of a bittersweet hope.She took a bow and tipped forward, her hair spilling around her face as she fell onto the stage, every last bit of energy wrung out from her.80     The train stopped, the door opened, and Onor and Evie stepped out.Onor half expected The Jackman to follow them, but he didnt.Stay safe, old friend, Onor whispered.Good luck.Evie pulled Onor through the same dirty station Naveen had led him through the first time they came here.Instead of going rightthe way Naveen had led himEvie tugged him left, following signs down an elevator into a small vestibule.A human guard stood at the far side.He straightened up as Evie and Onor approached.Can I help you?They had worked out how to approach this on the train while they ate tomato and peppered protein paste sandwiches acquired in Exchange Four.Now, Onors mouth tasted like dry fear and he had to force out the words.Were here to see if this is a place where some of us can live.Its been hard to get work.The guard looked at them with narrowed eyes.Hard everywhere.But theres no work here.He turned his gaze to Evies breasts.People dont come here on purpose much, not when theyre young and healthy.Theres a lot of us.Suspicion drained from the guards features.You came in from that ship.The Fiery Beast or something.The Creative Fire, Evie corrected him.We cant use your technology.Mostly.And you cant learn?Its hard.The guards face softened even more, and he grew a little tiny bit of a smile at the edge of his lips.It might have been touching if they didnt need to just get in as fast as possible.Were allowed to check ourselves in, right?Onor asked.We checked.Yes.But its a mistake.Onor decided at add to their story.Well be bought out.We need to know what its like in here, kind of like an advance guard.The guard looked puzzled.You want a tour?Yes, Evie said.Theres observation bays up above.Ive been there, Onor said.Will that really teach me what skills we need to live here?A shake of the guards head.Isnt that singer buying you free?Ruby?If she can sing every day for the next year.Is this the only way to get in?Evie asked.The guard stepped back.Almost no one comes this way.The very old, sometimes.Enforcers can make sure they get food.Most people are sent here.Evie said, Please, again, her voice small.You dont have anything valuable with you?the guard asked.Evie shook her head.Our slates.Keep them close.Be careful of your clothes if you take them off.Youre a little fine for this place.If you really do get out and then come back, bring trade goods.Trade goods?Onor asked.Things people want.Food.Drugs.Clothes.He held out a slate to each of them, looking as if he were committing a crime by allowing them in.Sign here to verify you are entering of your own free will and that you understand the cost of your stay.Taking the pen felt far more final than he had expected it to.His signature came out scrawled and almost unreadable.The guard waved Onor and Evie through a doorway.Your progress will be monitored.You will walk forward the whole way.If you turn around, credits will be added to the amount it takes to buy your freedom.I will guide you, Aleesi said in their ears.Last piece of advice, the guard said.It gets almost dark after dinner.You must be picked by then.Picked?By a gang.Youll see.At least they hadnt lost the earbugs.Onor still had an extra in his pocket, which he planned to give to Haric.Their footsteps echoed in the long corridor.The walls were scratched and dark and bare, the only adornment a long metal handrail that went all the way though.At the end of the corridor, a metal door irised open into a small empty room.Onor and Evie stepped in.The door closed and the far one opened.From above, the Brawl had looked big and confused.From here, it looked far, far worse.He realized he had half expected to find Haric just on the far side of the door, waiting for them.Instead, three enforcer robots stood at strategic points, and a press of people they had never seen watched them step into the room.81     Ruby sprawled bonelessly across the stage, breathing in great gasps of air, feeling the cool floor under her cheek and her right elbow and pressing against her calves.Her dress bunched tight across her chest, so it was hard to breathe.She tried to push up, to stand and take her bows.She felt and heard the audience willing her to stand up.Maybe if she could get a few breaths, a few moments.She managed to get up on one arm so that it was bent at the elbow.The fabulous fiery braids that Jali had spent so much time on hung over her face as if hiding her from the room.Applause mixed with the sounds of dismay and concern washed across her from near the front of the room, and calls for help for her.She heard Naveens voice as he hurried onto the stage.He spoke to the audience.Thank you!Thank you.Why didnt Naveen help her?Arms folded around her while Naveen kept talking and the audience kept clapping.She felt herself lifted from the stage and managed to hold her head up and wrap her arms around her rescuer.The brush of lips against her forehead caused her to roll inward and let her cheek fall against Joels chest.It wasnt possible that he was here, that he had picked her up.Not unless she was dying and he had come to lead her to the doorway all souls passed though.As he murmured her name, he sounded distressed and soft all at once, and entirely unlike someone who was taking her away from the world.Cloth.Get me a damp cloth!he called as they passed through the great curtains and cut her off from her audience.He clutched her tight to him and kissed her on the mouth, and only then did she believe he was real.Part Six          82     Ruby opened her eyes to her own familiar ceiling.Crisp sheets bunched around her legs.She shifted, testing.Her legs responded to her commands.She shouldnt be here.It took three breaths to remember her last moments on the stage, and being lifted up and carried behind the curtain.She closed her eyes and wished the memory away.But not her sweetheart.She could smell him and hear his breathing.She murmured his name.Joel.A hand touched her cheek.I should have been with you.They needed you here.She held out her hand, the movement slow and unsteady.Help me stand.His fingers brushed the hair from her face.Give it a minute.Did I get ...how did I get here?Satyanas robot give you a painkiller.You slept the whole time I took you back.You let them put me to sleep?I wasnt giving you a choice about coming home.I shouldnt have.I should be out there, working.Her protest was weakened by how good to felt to be here, how much she loved Joels fingertips on her lips and the sound of his voice.What about Jali?KJ?Did they come home?No.Satyana flew us home in a ship that barely had room for both of us.Probably the Honey.Did she show you the private habs out there?He looked both angry and lost.She showed me enough to demonstrate how much power we dont have.I know.He stood, took her hand, and tugged her to a standing position.She swayed.Her stomach felt as if shed been sick for days, but there were no knives of pain.She took a step toward the privy and almost lost her balance.Joel had to help her.She shook and her limbs only obeyed her under protest.She must look as weak as she felt.At least each step seemed a little more solid.By the time theyd crossed the room, she felt strong enough to shut the door with him outside.She stared into the mirror.Her face had thinned.Shed looked into mirrors before every concert, but shed been looking at the clothes Jali draped over and around her and at the way her hair had been done.Shed been thinking about songs instead of sickness.Surely she had another concert soon.She had to look better by then.She couldnt imagine eating, but took a cup and water from the sink.Then another.She filled herself on an amazing amount of water.A nightmare had fallen over her waking moments and it was all she could do not to fall to the floor under the weight of it.Dying wasnt acceptable.She managed to find a brush and get it through her hair, leaving a few of the toughest tangles until she found help for them.She needed Ani.Ani always had a comb.And a laugh.A hot washcloth felt rough against her skin, but at least it reddened her cheeks.As soon as she opened the door, Joel took her into his arms, clutching her tightly.His shirt was rough against her cheek and he smelled clean and felt like safety.He picked her up over a weak protest, and carried her to the bed, setting her down very carefully in the middle and sitting at the edge with a warm hand on her forearm.His voice sounded thick and a little hurt.I talked to you almost every day.You didnt say anything.I didnt know.I thought I was just tired.I am.Maybe.Just tired.If I rest I can go back.His only response was a stricken and disbelieving look that suggested she would never leave his direct protection again.She could argue after she got strong again.What did Satyana tell you?That youre going to die.She said maybe not.She said I could beat it.He smiled softly.Of course you can.I can.I wont be able to stand it if I lose you.The tone in his voice devastated her, a softness colored by so much longing that she felt tight in her chest just looking at him.Tell me about home.Whats happened here while I was gone?We talked every day.Im sure you kept all the sweetest bits from me.That made him smile.The bar is doing well.You told me that.People from the rest of the Deep come a lot, now.Some of them say they want to help us make Koren pay for what she stole from us.He looked serious, like he wanted to know what she thought.Theres a bigger conspiracy.Thats in trade for us helping them.He raised an eyebrow.Satyana?Yes.She asked me a lot of questions about you last night, and about us.I didnt feel like I could answer them all.Ix.Is Ix helping you?Yes.He hesitated.You should rest a little.Ill go get you some food.He stood up and planted a thoroughly chaste kiss on her forehead.You can do better than that.He could, and he did.He tasted like stim.As he left, she felt sure there were things he hadnt told her.83     Onor stayed close enough to Evie to protect her if she got into any trouble.Her shoulders slumped and her steps dragged.They hadnt rested since they left Ash, and at some point soon theyd be so tired theyd make a serious mistake of some kind.He touched her shoulder.Lets sit and think about this.We need a plan.Theres no place to sit.Ill find one.His feet already hurt; hers must, too.The one time theyd tried to sit on an empty bench, a gang of men had surrounded them and demanded they move.One more stop first, Evie told him.As if to make sure he knew she meant it, she pulled out her slate and held it up toward a woman standing guard outside of a scrap of protected territory.Have you seen this man?The woman reached toward the slate, but after one close call Evie had learned to keep it tight in her two fists.Yeah, sure.Tell me?If you trade me something.The woman gestured toward the slate.Not this.I need something.I dont have anything left to spare.She had traded away a comb and her necklace of colored beads in the first few hours, both times for bad information.An enforcer bot turned a corner near them, heading their way.They had been careful to avoid them.The woman laughed, as if she found both Evie and the silver bot absurd, or maybe the timing.Go that way.I think I saw him yesterday.Onor let Evie lead them in the direction of the womans pointed finger, which was also away from the bot.As soon as they walked out of the womans earshot, he whispered to Evie, Thats the fourth set of conflicting directions youve gotten.Haric wasnt even here yesterday.I know.She turned to look at him.We needed to go somewhere.The first man you asked sent us toward the observation wall.Onor flicked his eyes up.He could see one of the observation windows far above.Maybe even the one Naveen had taken him to.It looked far out of reach.The only other two people who answered you sent us in two other directions.She didnt say anything.Arent I right?Aleesi answered.Yes.Can you just tell us where he is?Onor asked.Do you have a clue?I cant see where you are.There are no public cameras in the Brawl.All of the space in the Brawl seemed to be guarded by family groups or gangs of opportunity.Onor took Evies arm.Lets walk and talk.Quietly.Stop drawing attention.What would Haric do if he were standing here?Ive been trying to decide that.Piles of food and slates and blankets and clothes seemed to be the protected heart of most territories.From the observation window, he had seen that people grouped, but from down here, the lines were clear and guarded.It was what he would do if people from the Fire were here, keep them together and safe and not let strangers in.This must be what the guard had warned them about.A group of two made a small, vulnerable target, especially if one of them was a pretty girl.Im sure Harics trying to get away to get back to us.To you.Evie blushed.What if we were trying to get home?What would we do?Walk around by the doors.I bet theres one set in each wall.We came through one and didnt see him.So that gives us three more to look at.Lets look before Im too tired to walk that far.So we start with the closest door.Okay.Onor tried to size up the enclaves they passed.There was no unclaimed space; they had to join a group or talk one into temporary rent if they wanted a place to sleep, or even to sit.He should have bought trade goods instead of letting worry drive them down here so fast.Look carefully into all the groups as we go.Haric has no idea were here.But he might be trying to hide until we can find him.Even though he stayed close behind her, Onor missed a tall man on the right grabbing for Evie until she screamed.The man tugged her through three other men until a wall of muscle separated her from Onor.Let her go, he demanded.Two men stepped toward him.Evie screamed his name.Onor!84     Ruby woke when the door opened.Instead of Joel, Marcelle stood with a cup of tea, some warm brown bread, and a relived smile.You need something to give you strength.Thank you.Ruby took the cup from Marcelles hand.She had pushed pillows together to create a nest that let her sit at the head of the bed and read news on her slate.Marcelle glowed so bright with impending motherhood that Ruby put a hand on her protruding stomach.You look ready.Marcelle sat on the edge of the bed and sipped at her own tea.I have to wait for Onor to get home.Where is he?Haric went to save the world and now Onor and Harics girlfriend Evie and The Jackman have gone to save Haric.Ruby stiffened.Have you heard from them?I havent, but Joel is off talking to Aleesi.That explained her conviction that Joel was hiding something from her.He should know better.I need you to help me get dressed.I want out of this little room.Joel will kill me if I let you move.Did being pregnant steal your sense of adventure?Ruby asked.Joels used to me disobeying.Pain struck from somewhere in her abdomen and she turned her head away from Marcelle.When she turned back, Marcelle looked stricken.Joel told me you might be dying.Are you?Not if I can help it.Satyana is sending a medical robot to help me.You should use it to look at the people youre so worried about.There arent any left.Ruby shivered.They died?We lost twelve, but thirty five or so got better.Marcelles brow creased and she extended a hand to feel Rubys forehead.Do you think its the same thing?The robot said so.Satyana says its called the Death of Hope.I hate the name.Marcelle touched Rubys cheek.The ones we lost were mostly infants and older people.You should be fine.Marcelle didnt look as confident as she sounded, but Ruby let it go.She would be fine.Help me get dressed.Eat first.Youre so thin your clothes will start falling off you soon.Ruby took a bite of the bread, which was hard to swallow.It calmed her stomach a little but it also filled her up.Thats enough.Its not.Dont be stubborn.Help me.Marcelle stared at Ruby for a long time before she extended a hand.Ruby chose the simplest version of the old uniforms that she could find.It galled her that Marcelle had to help pull up Rubys socks since it hurt to bend that far.The details of Marcelles earlier statement crept up on Ruby.Harics not old enough to have a girlfriend.You tell him that.Ruby laughed.It felt good to laugh.It seemed to take forever to traverse the small apartment and make their way to the bar.She sat down heavily in one of the chairs.Allen came right over to her and pulled up a chair, unasked.I heard Joel brought you back last night.He put a hand on her arm.We were rooting for you.What happened?She bit her lip.I dont know.I got tired and sick.Ill go back.I have to.Was that drunk part of the problem?Allen asked.She had to think about that a minute.You mean Naveen?Yeah.I dont trust him.I never did.Marcelle said, I think hes okay.Naveen wasnt easy to describe.Ruby did her best.Hes part of something bigger than we know.Everything is part of a conspiracy here.Were like children running amok through other peoples plans.You should see what I saw out there.The waste.The beauty.Its all so different than I expected.A wait bot showed up with two glasses of water and a plate of crackers and spreads.I wish people would stop trying to feed me.But she took the water and sipped at it.The bar was three times the size it used to be.I like what youve done here.It was partly for people to watch you.She sat back.Really?Watching the concerts?You always filled the place up.Ruby imagined the empty seats full of people eating and drinking, stopping from time to time to cheer for her.Im not worth all that, she said.Of course you are, Marcelle said.We didnt do this for you, Allen said.We did it for us.He smiled at her.Good.Ruby sipped some more water and Marcelle helped herself to a cracker and pushed the plate toward Ruby.She ignored it.Place is empty now.Itll start filling up.Ruby wondered what they were going to watch without her, but she didnt ask.She still didnt want to think about a world that she wasnt in.She couldnt let it happen.Not to her.Not yet.Not for years.As if on cue, Lya and a train of whispering women came through the door.They surrounded her in a circle.Ruby looked, but Min wasnt among them.She must still be back with Naveen and Jali and the others.Hopefully she was okay.Allen stood up.Dont cause any trouble now.Ill have you kicked out.Lya glared at him.Ive got enough friends for it.Would you give us some privacy, please?Lya asked.Allen looked at Ruby.Is that what you want?Ruby looked back at Lya.Okay.Yes.Allen and Marcelle left.Lya waited until they were all the way out of the room, then said, We have a message from Min.Ruby had been expecting a barrage of whispers and accusations.Yes?She says you cant trust Ix.Naveen manages it.He changed Ix so that it tells him everything it learns.Ruby sipped at her water, shifted in her chair, and drummed her fingertips on the table.Ix was the one trying to trap Koren.So was Naveen trying to help or hinder that?If they won back the profit from the Fire, she wouldnt have to sing any more.But Naveen hated Koren.Why would Min want to help me by telling me this?Why should I believe her?If she only felt better.It would be so much easier to think.Lya shook her head.Maybe you should believe her because she isnt your friend and she told you this anyway.Youre not the only one who cares about anything, you know.I know.She took a deep breath.Did Min say how she learned this?I asked her to get close to Naveen.And Naveen told her this?No.She heard him talking to someone else.He said that he was getting information about Haric from Ix.Is Min sure?Yes.Thats not enough to tell us that Naveen means us any harm.But we know hes keeping secrets.Everyone keeps secrets here.Even you, Lya.Min told me something else.Ruby swallowed and lifted her head to look directly into Lyas eyes.Lya pulled a lacy, white shawl that looked homemade tight around her shoulders, as if she were cold.She said you came back here to die.Would that make you happy?Ruby asked.Lya pursed her lips.It took her a long time to say, I used to think so.85     Onor couldnt see Evie.Three of the men who had snatched her stared at him, as if calculating his weight and speed and finding him wanting.A dark one, a huge one, and a blond giant who was at least as old as Joel.He couldnt let time go by.If Evie got hurt or raped, Haric would be devastated.Onor would never be able to forgive himself.Dont do this.Please.He stared at the men, who in turn stared at him.We have to be somewhere.Were looking for someone.I cant leave her.Then come on, the dark man said.Show us what you can do.His hands fisted at his side and his muscles looked bunched and ready under gray black skin.Onor tried to look brave as he subvocalized to Aleesi and Ix, Evie in trouble.Im going to try for her.I could lose.Tell Joel.Fear thrummed at his throat, drove adrenaline through his limbs, demanded action.He stepped toward the men.You cant just take her.Thats not legal.Do you see an enforcer?Spoken by the giant blond, twice as wide as Onor and a little taller.Onor stared at him, certain it was bad tactics to look away and search for a robot.We might be able to use a fighter.Show us you can fight.The men pushed forward, the blond giant in the fore and the other two behind.The man swung at him.Onor ducked.Laughter, and a second swipe of the big arm, this one connecting with Onors arm.Not a break, but he could feel pain deep in his bicep.Onor shouldered into his attacker, trying to unbalance the bigger man.The man tensed, pushed forward.Onor stomped on his foot.Evie!He called.Here!Good.She sounded strong, and still close by.Another blow, this one a hammer up into his stomach that lifted his feet and set him back down, stumbling slightly.Aleesis voice querying him.Whats happening?Onor was too busy struggling for breath to answer.He took three steps back, hoping for time.Give up?He had to take two gulping breaths before he could answer.No.Three of us could kill you.Evies voice from behind them, shouted.Run away.Think of Marcelle.Aleesis voice in his ear.You could die for fighting in the Brawl.There is an enforcer coming.Stall so it wont see you fighting.Onor glanced at the three men.They should be rushing him, but they were watching.Maybe this was like getting beat up on the lower levels of the ship.An initiation rite.Tell me about this place.Tell me what I get if I fight you and win.The girl lives.But you may not get to keep her.Onor frowned.And if I lose?The big man gave him a funny look.Then you lose the girl.I have other resources.Ix.Aleesi.Maybe Naveen.You should let us both go.Show us.The men were close enough he could smell the stale sweat of their bodies.The biggest one reached forward and grabbed Onor.Onor slid down out of his arms, landing on hands and knees on the hard floor.Arms slid around his torso.He kicked, but only managed a barely glancing blow.As the big man picked him up, Onor looked for the enforcer bot.Surely it was close.The man carried him fairly easily behind the protected property lines.Onors sides hurt from being gripped so hard and his arm hurt from being hit, but he managed to hold onto his slate.The man dropped him onto the floor beside Evie.Her eyes were wide and filled with desperation and anger as the men surrounded them.Onor pushed himself up to a crouching position, keeping as light as possible and trying to be ready to spring in any direction.The enforcer bot wasnt going to able to see them.Aleesi was silent in his ear.If only the AI could see as well as hear him.Nothing happened.No one threw another punch at him or tried to hurt Evie.Onor stood.He offered Evie his hand and she stood as well, the two of them looking around.What do you want?Onor asked.The tall blond who had seemed intent on killing him ten minutes before just said, Wait.Maybe they were waiting for the enforcers to pass.Whatever.It let him catch his breath.Onors legs hurt, and his stomach and arm still felt the blows that had rained down on him.Evie looked from face to face in the group, turning around to take each of them in at once.Onor watched her back, so he didnt see whatever made her gasp until she was gone from his side.He turned to find Evie buried in Harics arms and Naveen looking directly at Onor, a silly grin on his face.It took Onor a breath or two to step in and hug Naveen.How did you find us?It doesnt matter.What matters is getting you to court.Court?About Koren?Yes.Come on.Ill fill you in on the way.Haric can go with us?Of course.Onor got his first good look at Haric.Dark bruises and a cut marred his face.Someone had helped him clean up, but dried blood still flecked his shirt.What happened?Onor asked.You dont look too good either.Although Haric did look quite pleased to see Onor.He stepped forward and gave him almost as deep a hug as hed offered Evie.He seemed to have grown in the few days since Onor had seen him, gained something that made him feel adult.Harics voice sounded slightly husky as he said, Thanks for coming.I couldnt leave you loose in here.Oh, Ive been rescued for almost four hours now.Haric glanced at Naveen.But we need you.The assembled crowd around them still didnt look friendly, but they looked ...calm.Naveen addressed the big blond man.Get us to the door and Ill credit your accounts.Five of the men peeled out of the circle, and they returned to the aisle way, one man in front and three behind.Onor and Naveen walked behind Evie and Haric.You know these people?I hired them to find all three of you.They didnt find us.We walked by and they snatched us.It worked, didnt it?They beat me up.That was a show for the enforcer bots.Did it have to hurt so much?Naveen grinned.You did want it to look authentic, right?Not that authentic.Naveen appeared to be enjoying himself, although Onor sensed more nervousness in him than usual.It felt damned good to be back beside someone who understood the rules in here.Thank you.Thank me when were really out of here.We need to miss all of the bots.Why?Were not fighting.Because I had control of them, and now I dont.That means someone else does.That explained the undercurrent of nerves.Koren?Could be.Gotta be someone with a lot of credit.Could be unrelated to us.This place is a zoo of hacks and hatreds.They walked on for a while.A few of the guards and others they passed looked at them curiously, but most looked away.Onors guess was that the men theyd hired had reputations here.Why are you helping us?Dont worry, Im getting what I need out of it.Of course he was.Naveen took care of Naveen.Onor didnt even ask; it would become clear soon enough.How did Haric end up in here?He learned some things.So he was sent here to die.And you rushed in and saved him?Naveen laughed.No.I hired these guys to do it.One of them died saving him.Thats why theyre so long in the face.The group stopped, bunching up for a moment.They want us to go the other way, Evie hissed.Theres an enforcer bot.Damned things were never around when he wanted one, only when he didnt.He turned.They just had time to really get into a good formation again when the two men who were now in front stopped abruptly.This time, he could see the enforcer bot that had stopped them, the silver cylinder dipped slightly toward them as if showing that it had found its quarry.As soon as he turned away, he could see that the first bot had followed them.There was no place to go.86     Noise drew Rubys eyes toward the door just as The Jackman rushed through it, looking wild.He spotted their table and his eyes rounded with surprise.He came over to Ruby.What are you doing here?She laughed.Visiting.He could work out the details later.What do you know about Onor?He and Evie went into the Brawl.Theyre chasing Haric.Ruby stilled.Marcelles voice came out iced with control.I thought you said they went to an Exchange?Are they okay?Ruby asked.The Jackman shrugged.They were fine when I left them.Haric got caught.They went after him.His breathing sounded labored and his face looked flushed with exertion.Wheres Joel?Allen said, Probably in the morning meeting room.He spends all his time in there.The Jackman asked Ruby, Do you know where he is?She shook her head.I just got here last night.I dont even know where the meeting room is.His face softened as he looked at her.Is everything okay?Are you okay?She must look really bad if The Jackman was asking.Im better than Onor and Haric.She stood up.Lets go find Joel.It seemed to take a long time to reach the small meeting room.After Ruby, Allen, Marcelle, and The Jackman filed in, the space felt over full.There werent enough chairs.Joel motioned Ruby next to him, and gestured for her to sit on his lap, a rare public show of affection.He looked worried.I didnt mean to be gone so long.Im glad you found me.Me too.His hand encircled her, resting lightly on her tender stomach.The warmth felt good.Have you heard anything?Onor and Evie found Haric.Theyre safe?We dont really know, SueAnne said.Lya trailed in the door.Joel tensed.Ruby shook her head at him softly.Let her stay.Joel looked like he was about to argue when SueAnne interrupted, speaking to the AIs.Are they still in the Brawl?Aleesi spoke.I can hear them talk.They sound worried.Ruby narrowed her eyes.So they are in danger.Yes, Ruby, Ix said.Naveen is there.He may be able to make it all right.Surely Naveen wouldnt have gone into the Brawl in person unless it was safe.Ix?Ruby mused.Is there a way for Naveen to earn credit from all of this?He can broadcast anything.She remembered what Lya had told her.Do you work for us or for Naveen?I work for you.Joel was giving her a strange look, but she plowed on.She knew Ix.Shed had many conversations with it over the years.Do you report to Naveen?What do you mean?Does Naveen talk to you?Directly?No.Maybe Lya was wrong.Do you talk to Naveen?Aleesi interrupted.Ix.Check your outflow data.Surely Aleesi didnt need to talk to Ix out loud.
