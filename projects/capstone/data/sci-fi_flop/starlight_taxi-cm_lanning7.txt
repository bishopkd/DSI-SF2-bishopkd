David started whistling as the driver closed the door behind him.Tanya gave him a scowl as he walked toward the elevator.It was a slow descent into Hell for the driver as he finally got to ground floor and went outside.He lost it on the parking lot and puked under a tree.Wiping his mouth with his sleeve, he got into Starla and started the drive back to Lefont.All he could picture in his mind was Samantha...Jamies 5 year old girl.She spent some time at the office.Pattie would watch her for an hour or two after daycare until Jamie finished her shift.Goddammit, the driver muttered, a tear rolling down his right cheek.Im sorry, he thought.As he pulled back into Lefont, he parked outside the hub and went in.Jamie was being put into the back of a police vehicle as Samantha cried, being held by Pattie.The driver couldnt watch.He lost it again and ran into the bathroom to hurl.After taking a few breaths, he made his way into Chris office.His bottle was half empty, and a glass of bourbon sat untouched.Chris was looking out the window with the blinds open, his shadow coming across the blue carpeted floor and stopping at a nearby bookcase.Corporate called a few minutes ago...I get to keep my job, Chris said, without turning around.Oh yeah?Yeah...unfortunately, were down a driver.Jamie got busted for drugs, Chris said quietly.Samantha could be heard crying in the background.The driver walked over and picked up the glass of bourbon, downing it in one gulp.How did you get my job back?The driver picked up the bottle and glass and turned to leave.Chris raised his voice.How did you do it?The driver stopped for a moment and lowered his head.By now, Chris had turned around and was watching him, waiting for an answer.Dont ask questions you dont want to know the answer to, was all the driver said before he left.The commute home was miserable.Hed spent the day doing something pure evil, and all he wanted to do was get back and see Karmen.Parking Starla in the driveway, he walked up to the front door with the bottle of bourbon and glass.Karmen?On the marker board held to the fridge by magnets Karmen had left him a note saying she had to get to work, and shed call him later tonight.Well there you have it, the driver muttered.He walked slowly over to a cabinet and pulled out a white pack of cigarettes.Solstice growled when she saw them, but the driver took his drink and smokes out the back door.Going down to the grass were three cement steps.He left Solstice inside and sat down, lighting up a cigarette and taking a big drag.The nicotine didnt make him feel better, but in his mind he thought it did.He poured himself a drink and sipped it slowly as the moon started to become visible.Sometimes we have to make hard decisions, the driver muttered.After another few drinks, he picked up the bottle of bourbon and screamed as he threw it into the tree in his backyard.It smashed into the trunk, sending glass down into the grass below.Solstice scratched on the back door, wanting to be outside with her friend, who was clearly miserable.The driver didnt want to be with anyone, though.He wanted to be alone.Whoever said misery loves company had not met the driver.He was distraught over his filthy deed, and he wanted nothing more than to stew in his rage.The sad thing was, hed get his wish.He had all weekend to suffer for his recent actions.No Karmen to visit, no Chris to go on runs for, no neighbors doing weird things outside, because even Travis and Krickett were out of town.The driver was truly and utterly on his own, divided from even Solstice by a door.8: A Little Chat with God  The drivers alarm went off, and he awoke slowly.His red eyes screamed at the light.He hadnt shaved all weekend, and a small beard was beginning to form.Lack of sleep, much alcohol consumed, and still fresh guilt on his conscience all came together to create the Monday from Hell.He got up and walked over to the door where Solstice was sitting and waiting for him.She barked excitedly to see the driver up, but he was unable to return to her enthusiasm.Opening the back door, he motioned for his husky to go outside.She sat down and put her head on the ground.You dont need to go outside?She made no move, and he closed the door.Going in the kitchen, he got her out a can of food, opened it, and put it in her bowl.Solstice ran over and started eating immediately.Thanks for being patient with me, the driver said, patting her on the back.Hed been ignoring calls from Karmen all weekend, not wanting to talk to anyone.Hed have even send Solstice somewhere if he could have.The driver wanted to be alone with his guilt, and he had been.What sucked for the driver was it didnt seem to help any.Well Hell...I thought two days of suffering would let my guilt move on, but that just doesnt seem to be the case, the driver thought.A clap of thunder shook the house, and the driver looked out a window as rain drops started coming down unexpectedly.Awesome, the driver muttered.He hated being wet, and no matter how good the coat or umbrella he carried was, somehow, hed always get wet in the rain.Mother nature always defeated him, no matter his preparations.Going to get in the shower, the driver grabbed a green towel from his hall closet.He stripped, looking at all the scars on his body in his mirror.The driver cleared his throat and took a scalding shower.After showering and drying off, the driver threw on a blue t shirt and khakis under a brown leather jacket and his pub hat.He ran outside without taking Solstice with him, and she wasnt taking that well.He didnt leave her home alone much, and there was a reason for that.She hated being away from him.He heard her howling as he got into Starla.Travis was walking back up his driveway next door in a navy officers uniform.Why on Earth is he...you know what?I dont have time, the driver thought.He rolled down Starlas passenger side window and hollered over at his neighbor.Hey Travis!His neighbor turned and looked at the cab driver.How ya doing?I didnt see you at all this weekend, Travis hollered back.Im fine.Hey, listen, can I get you to let Solstice out this afternoon?Im not taking her with me today.You still got that spare key to my house?He nodded and flashed a thumbs up over at the driver.Great.Thanks!Ill bring you and Krickett home some dinner as thanks, the driver said, rolling up his window and taking off.Soon hed left Earths atmosphere behind.His earpiece buzzed, and in it he heard Pattys voice.Driver 2269, youre off to Tuscaville, a town of 50,000 in the southern hemisphere of Mars, Pattie said.Thanks Pattie.Im on my way.Who is my client?Hes a preacher needing a ride out to Payout City on Oberon, she said.The driver slapped his forehead with his hand.Why...why me?He couldnt stand religious folks.As a whole, he hated them and found they were a pretentious lot.There werent many left in this day and age, but the few that were left believed in ridiculous things.This day cannot get any worse, the driver thought.Your clients name is Dominik, Pattie said.Roger that, the driver said, heading off onto Intergalactic Road 34 toward Mars southern hemisphere.He tuned the radio in to some station that was playing solo piano music.As a song went off, he heard a female DJ with a melodic and soft voice say, That was Tims The Slacker, which has been popular in recent months.Coming up next well have one from Brad Wayne.Reaching into his left pocket, he pulled out his white package of Redillo cigarettes.He knew he was running low.Solstice not being with him at all times was allowing him to smoke at a higher rate than he had in past weeks.His mind was loving the nicotine, but his lungs sure werent happy with the return of the smoke.Pulling out what he discovered was his second to last cigarette, the driver lit it and inhaled deeply.He looked over at the passenger seat and did not see his usual companion.This bothered him a little, but his husky would make him happy, and he didnt think he was worth that at the moment.Looking at the yellow beams of light on the Intergalactic Road in front of him, his mind wandered to the little girl of the co worker hed gotten fired and arrested.He wondered what happened to her.As he got closer to Mars, the traffic got a little heavier.The red planet was more populated than Earth at this point, and the number of people traveling to and from showed that.As he came down into the atmosphere, he found a highway heading south and hopped on it.He radioed into Pattie and got some more detailed instructions on how to get to his client in Tuscaville.Youll take Highway 72 south, and eventually youll run right into it.Im showing youre on the right track now.Your client is about fifteen minutes south of you waiting outside a restaurant called Giovanis, Pattie said through his earpiece.Thanks, Pattie, the driver said.He continued south and eventually came upon the exit for Tuscaville.Lets get this over with, the driver muttered.Pulling up to the small restaurant, the driver began to look for his client.It wasnt long until he saw him sitting outside with a large pizza box next to him.The man was mostly bald with some hair left on his sides.He had a white beard that matched the color of his hair, and he was wearing a navy blue suit jacket and matching pants.The driver thought he looked like a typical minister, but at the same time, the way this man carried himself on the way to the car didnt appear to have the arrogance he associated with most of the religious scholars the driver had seen on television or had the misfortune to meet in real life.Unlocking the back door, the driver turned and saw his client get into Starla slowly.The man extended his hand toward the driver.Hello, my name is Dominik, he said.The driver slowly took the mans hand, unsure why he felt drawn to do so.A minute ago, he was ready to shut this mans mouth if he got out of line with his religious talk, but now, his annoyance was slowly retreating.This guy seemed pretty normal.Maybe its the pizza box that is throwing me off, the driver thought, looking down at the white box with simple red lettering on the top that said Giovannis.Dominik noticed the drivers stare and opened the box revealing a couple slices of thin crust Italian sausage pizza.Help yourself.I couldnt quite finish the pizza I ordered for lunch, and I hate letting food go to waste, Dominik said.Are you sure?Absolutely, Dominik said, moving the box up to Starlas front seat.The driver picked up a slice and took a bite.Wow, that has some kick to it, the driver said, his tongue tingling from whatever they put on the Italian sausage.Sorry.I guess I should have warned you it was a little spicy, Dominik said.Dont be.I like it; it just caught me off guard, the driver said, finishing his slice quickly and reaching into the glovebox.He pulled out a napkin and wiped his hands.So, Payout City?Thats right, Dominik said.Why does a preacher want to go gambling?Oh, I dont want to.One of my friends is in the hospital there.Im going to visit him and make sure hes okay, Dominik said.The driver shrugged and turned back around.He took off, and after a little bit, he was leaving Mars behind and getting on Intergalactic Road 87 toward Uranus moon Oberon.The trip would take a couple hours, and the driver, although not really annoyed by Dominik like he thought hed be, was not wanting to start any real conversation with Dominik on the off chance hed want to talk spiritual matters.About half an hour into the trip, Dominik cleared his throat and asked, So, how long have you been a taxi driver?About 25 years, the driver said, keeping his answer short to discourage any continuation of questions.Wow.Thats a long time.I can only imagine how many miles youve put on this vehicle going through the galaxy.The driver bit his tongue.He started to sweat.Turning his head slightly, he put all his effort into not saying what he wanted so badly to say.At last, he sighed and gave in.Even if it led to further conversation, he had to correct the minister.Her name is Starla, the driver said.Excuse me?The cab.Her name is Starla, and Ive driven her for 25 years, the driver said.Oh...sorry.I meant no offense by calling it a cab.I didnt know she had a name.None taken.Im just letting you know, the driver said, picking up the last slice of pizza in the box next to him and driving with one hand.Dominik let him finish the slice before asking him the next natural question in the conversation between cab driver and passenger.Why Starla?Because I work for Starlight Taxi.Oh.Thats unique, Dominik said.The driver said nothing in response and kept his mouth shut.Dominik kept the silence for another 45 minutes before trying again to strike up some small talk.Not much for conversation, are you?Im not really in the mood, the driver said, somewhat cross.Sorry, I didnt mean anything by that, Dominik said, somewhat awkwardly.Sighing, the driver said, It isnt you.I just had a rough weekend.Normally Im all for chatting up my passengers.Are you feeling okay?No.I feel like crap, the driver said, his cross attitude returning.Well...if you want to talk about it, Id be more than happy to listen, Dominik said.Its nothing.Dont worry about it, the driver said.I understand.If you change your mind, it looks like we still have a while before we get to Oberon, Dominik said.The driver said nothing for moment and then started to consider Dominiks offer.Maybe hed feel a little better if he spilled his guts to this stranger.You just listen?Because I swear, if you start talking about God, Im gonna send you to meet him, the driver said.Ill just listen, Dominik said, folding his hands in his lap.Putting his last cigarette in his mouth, the driver lit up and put the nicotine in his system hed need to tell this story.Ive spent the last few days feeling extremely guilty about my actions on Friday.I made a deal with the devil, so to speak.Dominik didnt even raise an eyebrow at that remark.He just listened, as he promised.The short version of a long story is I got a co worker fired and arrested so my boss could keep his job, the driver said.He went into greater detail about his deal with Peter and Chris being forced into early retirement.Describing Chris as the father figure he was, the driver actually started chuckling when he described the tumultuous relationship he had with the old man.Those chuckles disappeared when he got to the part of the story about snitching on Jamies drugs and Samantha having to watch her mother get arrested.I know that what I did was pretty dirty, but it was the only choice I had to save Chris job, the driver finished.Sensing that the driver was done talking, Dominik said, That sounds like a rough situation.I had no idea that a taxi company could be so...well...dark.Its just the higherups that are like that, apparently.Chris is a great person to work for, the driver said.He sounds like hes a good manager, Dominik said, smiling.Another lull entered their conversation as Starla headed on toward Oberon.Dominik looked outside at the infinite white sprinklings of light just on the other side of his doors glass window.Taking a chance at stirring anger in the driver, he took a deep breath and said, You know, you arent like most people.It seems the bulk of society is always looking for other people to blame for their problems, you know?We live in a time where people hate accepting responsibility for their actions.The driver listened, waiting for Dominik to arrive at a conclusion.He made no point to stop the minister from speaking.When he saw that the driver was listening to his words, Dominik continued, You dont seem to be like that, though.You, do the opposite, which is in many ways just as bad.You look for situations where you can feel guilty and then take it to the extreme.How so?Well, consider the woman you got arrested.You were trying to save your boss job after hed been fired through no fault of his own.This woman was breaking the law and company policy by taking illegal substances, Dominik said.Yeah, but she wasnt hurting anyone.Not to mention, she has a daughter.We all knew her secret.She just took a pill now and then to take the edge off, the driver said.Im not saying this woman is a bad person.For all I know she could be the best mother in the world.What Im saying is, if you hadnt turned her in, she could have been caught any other day.A random drug test...an angry co worker...a surprise inspection...any of those things could have tripped her up.Still...she has a daughter, the driver said.She likely knew there were consequences to her actions.She just paid for those consequences a little earlier than she expected to.And to top it off, you werent turning her in for selfish gain.You were doing it to save another mans job...a man who...by the looks of it doesnt do anything wrong in running his taxi hub, Dominik said.The driver said nothing because he was thinking on Dominiks words.He wanted so badly to agree with the minister, but he still thought he should feel guilty for costing a single mother, who had never harmed him, her job.Look, I imagine you have other things to worry about on a day to day basis.We all carry around our own burdens at times, but this isnt something you need to carry.By the looks of it, youve suffered more than enough for something you never should have felt guilty for in the first place, Dominik said.Nodding his head, the driver looked in the rearview mirror and said, You make a strong case, preacher man...and whats more, you did it without condemning me to a fiery oblivion.Im impressed.Im just trying to reel you into my church so I can condemn you later, Dominik said, laughing.And for the first time in days, the driver laughed.He laughed harder than he should have because Dominiks joke wasnt all that funny, but he laughed until tears were running down his eyes.As he wiped the tears from his eyes, the driver entered the atmosphere of Oberon.Starla jerked a little bit, but ultimately, the crater covered moon let the driver in just fine.Of all the planets and moons in the galaxy that had been terraformed, Oberon was perhaps the most luxurious.Cities lined the moons reddish surface, each with more money than the last, and a number of bad things happened in those cities that the One Galaxy Republic turned a blind eye to due to the taxes the casinos generated.I almost felt bad about taking the minister to such a rough place.
