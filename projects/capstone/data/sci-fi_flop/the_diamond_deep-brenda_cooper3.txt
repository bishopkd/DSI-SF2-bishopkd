She did whisper, Thank you.Thank you.Thank you.If Ix replied to her, the room was too noisy for Ruby to hear what it said.During the long time that it took for the room to quiet, Ruby wondered if humans had been hurt on the ship, or if instead they had simply damaged robots.Maybe Adiamo was populated by machines, and they were coming home to become the soft slaves of robots.Nothing else happened on the screen.The ship continued to hang in space, and no more pieces broke off.Can it hurt us?she whispered.No response.She spoke into the microphone.Ix!Can it hurt us?Im calculating.Onor and Marcelle had come closer to her.Ani was with them.The screens went dark, as if to signal that the show was over.Ix spoke.I believe we have damaged the other ship enough that we will be able to pass it and continue on our way.It may or may not be able to repair itself.For now, we are safe.21     Ruby sat at the head of the bed, naked, her legs curled up close to her, her body a ball she held together with her interlocked arms.Exhaustion and relief warred in her nerves.They could have died.Winning felt like exhilaration and abomination all at once, like victory tinged with a feeling she couldnt quite put a name too, but which was like the way she felt about what Joel had done to her enemies.Power used because there was no other easy or comprehensible way to survive.Joel moved around the room, putting things away, organizing.His jaw was tight and stiff, his face unreadable.Usually he relaxed in here, with her.Even though he had refused her entry to his councils, it seemed like so much had happened since then that they were already different people than the ones who had started the argument that still lay between them.She forced herself to stretch, used breathing techniques KJ had taught her to let go of the fears and exhaustion gnawing at her.She spoke quietly.I could add value to your councils.He stopped and stared at her, his face softening a tiny bit.You will not add any value if I am not able to hold onto my power.I may have disposed of one enemy, but there are more.Ruby winced but kept her voice as soft as she could.You need representation from my people.It wasnt possible, not today.Save this fight for a time when it wont distract us from more important things.Ruby bit her tongue.Besides, he continued, If you didnt press in public, I wouldnt have needed to turn you down in public.Damn him.She held her temper and her hurt as far away from her heart as possible.My people have good strong voices.Theyre brave and they know how to work together.Are they your people?Joels words made Ruby flinch.Even now when youre here, with me?he added.How long can that hold true?The implications of his thought made her angry.Of course they are.I grew up with them.I went to them when you wouldnt let me join you.I sat with them in the common room and we waited for the ships to win, sure they might not.I sat with them, waiting to die.His voice rose a touch and got more commanding.If I had let you into our council, you wouldnt have gone to your people.Maybe that was the right decision.For you to be there.That stopped her for a moment.Maybe so.But everyone needs a voice in your councils.If Ix had failed to blow up that ship, we would all have died.He raised an eyebrow at her, still standing in one place, one hand on an open drawer.What would have changed about the decision if you had been there?Or if more people had been part of it?A crowd makes a decision impossible.She turned her head to hide the frustration that must be visible in her eyes.Not to acquiesce, never to acquiesce.It was a good decision.Almost all of your choices are good.But decisions made in the dark arent always fair.You and Iwe can be a symbol.We can be the mother and father of our people, united.We can stand side by side and represent the balance of work and command, the joining of man and woman, the beauty of song and the strength of a ready warrior.He laughed and she realized how exaggerated her words weresomething meant for lyrics instead of to heal an argument.But they were true.She didnt try to take them back.He pushed the drawer shut and continued stripping, standing there long and lean, marked with old scars from years spent training and fighting, but nonetheless whole and vibrant.Even when she was angry with him, he drew her.Maybe even more then.She opened an arm toward him.He came to lie beside her.She let her fingers play through his short, graying hair.He had not acknowledged what she asked for.I love you, she said.Remember before?The first time we met?I told you that I needed to matter, that I needed to be more than a lover.You do.You are.She ran her hands over his shoulders, her touch light.The best lover, he murmured.So strong, so perfect.For a few moments touch was the only conversation between them.Then he whispered, You have more power than you know.But there are places others are not ready for me to allow you to go.But they will be.You can help them to be ready for me.He reached a hand up and caressed her cheek.In the meantime, I am happy to listen to you.Im valuable for more than bedroom advice.She took his hand in two of hers and began massaging his palm, using her thumb to draw strong circles in it.Perhaps she had pushed far enough for this moment.He would think about it.He was like that often, listening to her with no reaction and then evaluating what she said.Ask me a question.He smiled, his blue green eyes bright in a face paled with exhaustion and slightly reddened by arousal.Such a hard life he led, so much pressure.She wasnt sure he was going to answer, but he finally asked, What do you think it means that the only greeting from home so far is an attempt to steal from us?That we must be very, very careful.He sighed.Yes.There may be no need for any of us at all now that the ship is back.Perhaps we were always slaves.She drew in a sharp little breath, and then let it out slowly.It cannot be like that.We are too brilliant, too creative, too strong to waste.But we were wasting you, even inside this small ship.She put a finger over his lips.At least you know that now.Yet he had wasted the people who followed Ellis and Sylva.She slid to her knees and straddled him, her naked body touching his in as many places as she could manage without dropping all of her weight onto him.Perhaps we should make sure not to waste this night.Tomorrow is getting even more uncertain.In answer he pulled her down, kissing her so hard that she felt her lips bruise.It felt good.Part Two          22     Onor finally found Ruby in the cargo bar, chatting with Allen.Colins fight leader had become one of a handful of heirs apparent after Colin and Pars deaths, but in the three days between then and now, no decisions had been made.Ruby smiled up at the man, her head cocked, her face fully attentive.Onor hesitated: Ruby twirled a glass of wine in her hand and a hint of red flush stained her cheeks.She turned her head as Onor approached, and it became too late to back away.Besides, he didnt want to.Clearly she was able to read his mood.She stood up, her face instantly gone from soft and teasing to tense.What happened?I need to talk to you in private.She looked torn, but this wasnt a conversation he was willing to share with Allen.This wont take long, he added.Ruby whispered something to Allen, kept her glass, and followed Onor as he turned and led her out of the room, and into the same private space where he and Haric had told Colin and Allen about the approaching ship.Unsurprisingly, Ruby ignored the table and sat on the worn blue couch.She gestured for him to sit beside her.I prefer to stand.Now that he had her in a private place, he didnt know how to begin.Angry sentences piled up behind his lips, unwilling to emerge.She waited him out, twisting her hands in her hair and pulling out clips, letting it fall.He turned away.He tried to modulate his voice, but failed.I know what happened to Ellis and Sylva.And the others.She didnt say anything.The silence dragged on until he couldnt help himself, and he turned to look at her.Her pale blue eyes showed no remorse at all.Her muscles had tensed, and her lips thinned.Some of the other sentences hed been holding back came out, sounding disjointed.It was murder.Turning off life support.How could you?Do you know how horribly they died?She nodded, controlled calm to his storm.Her words came out slow, as if she were on stage talking to a group of children.They were trying to take over the ships command.Right when we were being attacked by an enemy.That doesnt make it honorable.They would have killed us.Maybe.But you could have locked them up.They could have been killed in a fair fight.Most of their followers were just blind; we could have saved them.KJ and his people could have taken them.I doubt they could have gotten in to command.He realized he had moved to stand over her.She smelled of wine and spices, and her face stayed cool and collected.She took another sip of wine, holding the glass to her lips for a second too long.When she finished, she said, They were your enemies, too.I wouldnt have done that to them.Even to protect me?She stood up, her gaze meeting his evenly.Joel did it to protect me, so he didnt need to worry about me and the ship all at once.Her words felt like punches in his chest.Not because they were wrong.Because they were wrong for her.She lived for fairness, fought for fairness, and now she was defending cold blooded murder.He stepped back, and the wall stopped his movement too fast, the room too small to contain them both.We did thiswe fought this fightfor justice.For everybody.You cant just become like Garth, and kill people because they ...they inconvenience you.Ruby took another sip of wine.She had become so much better at controlling herself than she used to be, so much more ...theatrical.He slammed his fist backward into the wall, the sharp thud and the pain both good.Youre not the same anymore.You would have hated yourself.She closed the distance between them and her hand came up and slapped his left cheek hard enough to shift his balance so that he fell against the wall and had to shuffle his feet to keep them under him.Her cool had gone completely, her voice high and tight.You cannot know what we have to deal with, what its like to be responsible.Every day Joel and his people have to make decisions they hate.I do fight them, some of them.I fight more than you can possibly know.So tell me how you fought this one?She met his gaze for a moment, and he finally saw guilt and confusion on her face before she turned away.I didnt.I didnt know about it.Not until after it was done.He stood behind her, close enough to smell her again, and he put his hands on her shoulders.Her shirt was so thin that he felt her bone and muscle beneath his hands, even felt the warmth of her body.A single multi colored strand of beads hung around her neck, visible from behind only because shed tugged her hair all to one side.Her muscles tensed under his hands.He tried to shift his weight and turn her, but she shook her head, refusing to meet his eyes.Why do you protect Joel?he asked her.Hes smart enough to keep us all safe, and hes willing to care.She turned, breaking his grip so his hands fell by his sides.Her eyes were damp.Theyd lost the guilt, and instead she looked resolute.You cant understand.Try me.I cant be everything, Onor.I must maintain my position or I will lose my ability to keep the fairness we have won.Choices have to be made.She paused, took a deep breath, and when she started again her voice was firmer but softer.If weif IIf I fight every fight, I will lose one day.And if I lose, then weall of us from graywill lose our voice.Her look melted the anger out from under him, so he felt a bit loose in his moorings, a bit empty.We can also lose if youor wegive up our principles.Dont you think I know that?After all weve been through, Im clear on what matters.But we have gained so much that we cannot afford to lose, and power contains compromise.She paused.Youre the one who is always talking about power, thinking about power.We used to be the ones who didnt have it.Now we do.She did.As if she were reading his reaction, she said, You, too.Joel trusts you.The Jackman and Conroy trust you.Come on out with me and help me work on Allen.Once you have power, you dont keep it by fighting.He touched her cheek.She gazed at him for a long time, a universe of feelings in her eyes.Then she turned away.23     Ruby hated pressure suits.They stank.The best one shed been able to find had slightly short legs so she always felt like she should bend her knees, and the right elbow joint was harder to move than the left, so she expected to overcompensate in low g and jerk herself to the left of where she wanted to go.Everything must have been perfect when the Fire left Adiamo, but she was willing to bet half of the damned ship would fail by the time it got home.She didnt like the airlock a whole lot more than the stiff and stinky suit, especially since it felt crowded with two of them.KJ sat closest to the bay door.She had wanted Onor or Marcelle, but the only way Joel had allowed her to visit the robot spider was with KJ right next to her.She held her breath while pressure equalized, relaxing only when KJ could open the inner door to the cargo bay.They sat side by side on the lip of the lock, looking down.The small amount of gravity that Ix let them impose on the bayabout twenty five percentallowed their legs to hang down in a fashion.Lights illuminated most of the vast space, although there were corners where shadow still ruled.The traverse lines had all been replaced and strengthened.A crew of KJs carefully trained fighters, now nicknamed spider dancers, waited on the far side of the bay by the other airlock.They crouched as still as the metal ribs of the vast bay.They would only move if KJ asked them to, or if they perceived that KJ or Ruby were in life threatening danger.Blocky, multicolored cargo containers were strapped and bolted to the walls.The containers the robots had cut loose had been retied with bright yellow straps, so that they stood out from the others.Two spiders sat unmoving, still trapped in ropes.They looked as dead as she had been assured they were; chains and ropes held their metal limbs in lifelike poses.A third had been reduced by half.Four legs had been taken out of the hold piece by piece to be examined by a bot repair crew.The last living one sat where it had been captured, still trussed in rope and chain.It flexed its metal appendages against its bonds.It sees us, Ruby whispered.KJs answer reminded her of a conversation theyd had getting ready for this.They have a good sense of their surroundings, and act as if they can see in every direction at once.I want to get closer.Of course you do.If they were in a world without helmets and radios, she was certain hed be laughing at her.She grabbed a traverse line and hooked onto it.Be careful, KJ whispered.Ill be right behind you.The vertical traverse passed near a horizontal line, and she switched, heading toward the bot shed saved.When she stood on the outer edge close to the bot, she stared in awe.Its mass reminded her she was small and soft.Its front appendages ended in the claws that had cut cargo straps as if they were paper, severed traverse lines, and destroyed humans.The claws were as tall as Ruby, and each of the three long metal bones between the joints were also as tall as Ruby, and wide enough that she would fit inside them if they were hollow.Each leg could bend in three places.KJ glided down the traverse and stood beside her, both of them silent in front of the bound enemy.Ruby took a deep breath through her mouth, doing her best to avoid the suit smell and the almost unmanageable temptation to rip her helmet off.There was air, but the safety protocols in the cargo bays were strict.She chewed her lower lip.Its not completely different than our bots, she said.I can see how the claws move.KJ responded in his typical dry tone.It is bigger than most of ours.Theres transport bots that are a quarter this size.She tried for humor.I suppose its possible to consider the trains a bot.Whatever works for you.Just dont leave this anchor line and dont get too close.Lets get started.As if in answer, the bot flexed all of its appendages at once, straining its bindings.She wondered if this one had torn Colin in half.Ix.Ruby called the AI up, surely unnecessarily.Protocol, like the helmets.Ix, tell it were here and tell it we want to know why they invaded us.I will translate.The conversation should have been fast.Machines talked to each other much more quickly than humans.But it wasnt.She waited, and waited some more.She listened to her breath, and KJs breath through the radio link between them.There was time to wonder if Ix hadin factdecoded enough of the speech between the bots to build a communication bridge between itself and the invader.She shifted, trying to get comfortable with the floating feeling of low g again.Ix chose a voice she had never heard, tinny and feminine.What happened to the Thief of a Thousand Stars?Ix changed to its most common voice.That must be the invaders ship.Aptly named.Ruby regarded the huge bot, which did not react directly to her presence in any way.We damaged it.It has been left far behind.We had no choice.This time the answer was fast.But it is not completely dysfunctional?Does it have life support and engines?Ruby managed to bite back a comment about how she hoped not.We dont know.Silence.After a while, Ruby asked Ix, Is it talking to you?No.Nor is it moving.But its not dead?Im not sure that question applies.It remains capable of responding as far as I can tell.There is nothing like this in my history of Adiamo.Ruby had prepared questions in her head.Ask it if Adiamo is full of people or robots or both.More time.KJ shifted and moved, stretching.She followed his lead.It helped calm her.The spider dancers remained in the corner, but they too stretched and moved, as if following their leader.At one point in Ixs long silence, the bot thrashed and flexed, although the bonds held.It is not answering.Very well.More standing.She had asked Ix to record this, hoping it would be a good backdrop for a performance.She looked at KJ.While we wait, can we climb around some?Maybe go look more closely at one of the dead ones?KJ didnt respond immediately.Please?In answer, he stepped back and pointed up the traverse line she still held in her right glove.He wanted her to go first.Very well.The leap up worked pretty well, and she clung to the line with both legs.Her body remembered a trick shed been taught, and she pushed out from the line, so her hands and feet were both on it, but not her belly.She walked her hands up, then her feet, then her hands, then her feet, hands, feet, her appendages hard to keep stuck to the line with no gravity.A matter of gripping with her gloves and toes.KJ hadnt started up after her.She was a good way past him now, and the robot looked smaller.She let go and pulled, which felt less awkward, but was slower.She stopped again, and this time KJ started up after her.He moved with no extra movement, no real pull on the line, nothing.He made small movements to maintain trajectory and add speed, as if null g made him dance.She grimaced.Ix?Did it say anything yet?No.Are you still trying?What do you suggest?Play it our history.One of the lessons from school.The one that starts when we leave Adiamo.KJ spoke up.You want to give an enemy our history?I dont see what it can hurt.How do you think it will help?Maybe if it understands us, it will be sympathetic.KJ laughed.Follow me.They had reached open space near the middle of the bay, all of the closest objects other traverse lines, the robots small again.KJ contorted his body, drawing completely in on himself, and then pushed, sailing for a nearby horizontal traverse line.She tried to mimic him exactly, but wavered when it came time to let go, stealing her own momentum from herself in a brief flash of fear.She fell away from KJ and the lines.A hand grabbed her long before she expected to be caught.Thank you.He helped her get both hands onto the new line.Her fall had cost them some distance.Thank you again.We should have sent you in with these damned things first.Youd have survived and wed still have Colin.Yes.She wished she could see his face.So why didnt that happen?I was guarding Joel.He paused, and then pointed.Up.Were going to look at the one thats been partly taken apart.Joel probably made the decision about who went where.Ix?Make it tell us why it killed people if you can.It is not responding.Can you tell if its listening to you?Only if it responds.Ruby was slower than KJ, but she didnt make any more serious mistakes on the way to the half a bot.It was scratched and dented where the spider dancers had separated its parts, but it was still big enough to be daunting.She gritted her teeth and looked away the first time she touched it.All of the legs on one side had been removed by KJs spider dancers.The remaining legs were still tied down.The torso was small, maybe the size of a human torso.There were no animals or insects on the Fire, just plants and people and robots.But Ruby had seen pictures.In Adiamo, the game about their home system, there were four legged mammals, myriad insects, and birds of all sizes.She studied it.Even though it was far larger, it was simpler than the robots shed grown up cleaning.It was a better description to say they all joined below it.The design of the robot encased the small torso in a cage that the ends of the legs could rotate around.Or at least that was the best way she could think of to describe it.This part of the design was nothing like what she knew.She crouched, holding onto one of the legs and staring.Elegant, she whispered.And what were you really?Whatever was in the cage, nothing could touch it during normal operation of the robot, at least not as far as she could tell.There was an inner structure that supported it, but no strength, no torque.She pointed.Why didnt you take this part?We couldnt cut it free.Theres a team coming back for it this afternoon.Okay.I want to see it.Tell me when?Were keeping it pretty much out of sight for now.She froze in place, wishing yet again that they werent in suits.The bulk limited her ability to display body language.KJ?Yes.Flat, noncommittal.Last I checked, you and I were on the same side.The one that wants freedom and information and fairness and a voice for all, right?Silence.Answer me.I dont work for you.Of course you dont, she snapped.She took a deep breath.But you and I should be working together.Before I came up from gray, I worked on robots.I know a few things.And theres some more things I suspect about these.I know.So dont keep secrets from me.He said nothing.The man was harder to read than anyone she knew.Ani could have him ...Sex with KJ would be a perfect dance, but youd probably never know if youd given him pleasure.Follow me, he said, inching up toward the claw.Look here ...we think it was designed to be a weapon.So maybe he was willing to answer her in his own way.She paid careful attention while he pointed out features of the claw and the arm, and then the powerful, flexible feet.They stared at the object in the cage.It was almost featureless, as long as her calf, and almost as big around as her waist.Smooth and black.Have we gotten a good look at this in the live bot?The way its tied we cant see it at all.She rocked back, staring at it.No, were not going to move the live one.She laughed.Im not that much of an idiot.But maybe theres footage.Ix?Can you review your recordings for anything we can learn about this?It has to be the brains.Yes, Ruby.Is it talking to you yet?No.All right.Let me try one more time.She needed a reaction, some kind of win for keeping the thing alive.Back at the bottom of the bay and staring up at the bot, Ruby said, Ix?Translate.Ready.We are unhappy that you invaded us.It is a fact that we damaged your ship, and it is done.It cannot be undone any more than the way that you killed our people can be undone.Now that you have our history, you know it has been a long time since we left Adiamo.We have told you our story.Will you tell us yours?Ixs spider voice asked, Is the Thief of a Thousand Stars following you?She didnt know.Ix responded.No.The machine remained silent.She stood, nearly floating, holding onto the vertical traverse line.Ix?Yes, Ruby?Is the air in here safe?Yes.She unclipped her helmet so the spider thing could see her.Dont, KJ warned.Its only a rule.She drew in a breath of fresh air, full of strange lubricants and smells that must be unique to cargo.Shed had her helmet off on cargo beforealways against ordersand she didnt remember the oily tang she scented now.She didnt know what she was hoping for, just that maybe ...maybe ...the bot would react to her humanity.There had to be some way to touch it, and damned if any talk theyd tried had done it.She started in on Homecoming:  Long and dark is our night flight No stars shine inside Fires skin, only Me and you.And love.Were going Home No reaction.She sang it all the way through, putting as much feeling as she could into it.As her words trailed off, KJ whispered, Bravo.He didnt sound as ironic as she expected.She whispered back, Youre welcome.She sang two other songs.Singing to the unresponsive metal seemed both ridiculous and right.Ix interrupted.The Creative Fire is being hailed by Diamond Deep.Another ship?KJ asked.A space station.Ruby put a gloved hand on a suited hip and spoke to the robot one more time.Were going to go talk to Diamond Deep.Well be back.We would ...we would really appreciate information.She waited, hopeful.KJ interrupted her.Time, Ruby.I know.After you.Put your helmet back on.She had promised to obey KJ, and shed already pushed it.Still, she hated fastening the damn thing again, losing her own senses to the overwhelming stench and dulled sight of the suit.On the way up the traverse lines, she struggled to turn her thoughts from the huge and non responsive machine toward the space station.Diamond Deep.Halfway up the traverse lines, she asked, Do you think the station will be friendly?Are you asking me or Ix?You.I think its best not to expect anything.That way, youll always be surprised, but youll never be caught napping.Like the robots.Like the robots.Next time you practicewith the spider dancers, in a cargo baycan I join you?How could you possibly have time?I want to do everything.He was silent until they reached the airlock.While they were inside, out of sight of the robot and maybe even of Ix, he whispered, You cant be everything.You have to trust others.The words stung.I trust you.He laughed.A light came on.KJ opened the outer door of the lock, and he and Ruby spilled out into the corridor.KJ took his helmet off after they were safe, and Ruby followed his lead.You did well in there, he said.How?It didnt respond to me at all.You didnt threaten it, or bully it.You were sincere.Iflike you suspectit is more than a machine, then you may have affected it.Do you believe me?Yes.I hate leaving it right now.Well come back.Hurry, Ix interrupted.Joel wants KJ with him now.Hes sending Dayn with a faster cart.24     Onor stood with his back to the wall of the map room.Sharp worries crawled up his spine at the new threat.After the spiders, he didnt trust anything from Adiamo.The core of the command level assembled, coming in by twos and threes until about twenty five people filled the room.Ruby came in with KJ, looking sweaty, her hair a touch awry.Back when Joel had been supporting the insurrection army Onor belonged to, he had felt nothing but admiration for the man.As he watched Joel walk over to Ruby and whisper in her ear, Onor wondered if power itself corrupted.Now that Joel stood in Garths place, he seemed to have become more like the man he overthrew.Ruby herself had lost clarity, ripped between conflicting loyalties.Maybe that was what you got for sleeping with the enemy.He shrugged off the thought as uncharitable, but he felt a stinging kernel of truth in it.Ellis and Sylva, and so many followers, killed so coldly.After Joel and Ruby finished a low conversation that drew their heads together, Joel addressed the room.We have received a message from one of the space stations that orbits Adiamo, the Diamond Deep.After you hear it, please keep the contents secret for now, and think about how we should respond.He glanced at Ruby, his voice firming.Then we will play it for others.To her credit, Ruby didnt argue in public.She wasnt happy, though; Onor could see that in the way she swiped her fingers through her hair, tugging on tangles hard enough that it had to hurt.Her power was twofold: the power of the love the outer levels still held for her, and her power to keep Joels attention.No, threefold.Her feelings had powerthey were what drove her to risk, what came out through her songs.Listen carefully, Joel said.A warm voice issued from speakers near the ceiling, booming into the room with a touch too much volume.Creative Fire.Welcome home.I am Headman Stevenson, the freely elected leader of the orbiting station Diamond Deep.We are pleased to see that you have returned.Please have your pilot set course for our station.We will open a data transfer to receive the downlink of your journey so that we can arrange a proper reception.Is that all?Ruby asked.Yes.Onor took a deep breath.Pilot must refer to Ix: no one in this room was navigating.If they hadnt run into the ship with the spider bots, he would have taken the announcement at face value.But they had.For a time, no one spoke.Joels quietly asked, What do you think?Laird said, I dont trust them.SueAnne followed him.We have to go somewhere.Even if this whole system is untrustworthy, we are slowing down and falling apart.I would not give them data, KJ mused.Not yet.Lets find out what they want it for first, and who they are.Ix?We were sent out here by the government on Lym, right?Shouldnt we speak to them first?Lym is no longer highly populated.It is not the seat of power in Adiamo anymore.Think of it as a big park.Onor shifted, watching the backs of peoples heads from his post by the wall, wishing he could see their faces.The conversation continued for five or ten more minutes, although it didnt get closer to resolution.There simply wasnt enough information.He wasnt the only one who came to that conclusion.KJ spoke up.We dont need to respond immediately.We do have two ways to learn more.One is for Ix to continue listening and evaluating and learning.Andsince this must be our decision and not the machines choicewe need to be shown everything Ix is learning.Joel agreed, Shortly.KJ continued.The other is that thanks to Ruby, we may have a way to learn directly from the invaders.As you know, one of the robots in our hold is still functional.Ruby is working on communicating with it.Although there is no real progress so far, it is an avenue worth pursuing.Laird spoke up, Then we should work on it!KJ countered, She has started to build a rapport.Laird looked at Joel, as if to ask him to stop being an idiot.Joel ignored the content of the look, and very calmly said, Ruby is one of us now.Laird narrowed his eyes.It was Rubys idea, Joel continued, and she has invested the time.Ix is working with her, and KJ.I cannot afford to spend your time there; I need you as my advisor and my weapons master.Ruby will continue the work after she rests.After spending generations getting here, we do not need to answer Diamond Deep today.Joel walked toward the door closest to Onor.He gave a hand signal that Onor should follow him, and to his surprise, Onor found it was just he and Joel walking out of the command room.Joel walked him through a maze of corridors.The ship creaked and groaned around them, and from time to time a maintenance bot whirred along a wall.Their footsteps almost matched, although Joels fell slightly heavier.Joel turned around at a door he didnt open, and led them back the way theyd come.Onor expected to feel angry with Joel for the lives hed taken, but instead he remembered the mans strengths and then felt guilty for it.This was Rubys dilemma, too.Being close to power and understanding the nuances, being torn by conflicted loyalties.Everything Onor could remember about who he was before they won battles and changed the ship would have condemned Joel for his choices.But right now, they needed him.No one in command would follow Ruby.Colin had been torn into bits, and SueAnnethe best other choice by temperamentwas too old.Laird would be a disaster.Onor hated the new order on the ship.Joel broke the silence first.Im pleased at how well you did in the cargo baygetting you and Marcelle away safely.Onor felt surprised that Joel even knew Marcelles name.Thank you.If Marcelle hadnt been so fast, we would have been caught.Tell her Im glad shes safe.Joel gave him a look that suggested he knew what had happened between he and Marcelle.Onors cheeks heated as he said, I will.What were they like?The spider bots?Surely Joel had seen them.Big.Very big.And fast.I was surprised how fast they were.None of our robots are that fast.What did they make you feel like?Angry.He felt it all over again, the sense of violation.They invaded our space.They killed a man I respected.Thats how you feel now?Angry?Yes.But how did you feel when you first saw them?When you realized they could jump?When they got close to you and almost caught you?Were you afraid?Of course.Onor hesitated, searching for the right words.It doesnt matter what we felt.What we did matters, what they did.That they killed.Joel smiled softly.I would have been afraid.He paused.But Ruby sees something else.Onor had known shed saved the last bot from destruction, but he hadnt known about her and KJ trying to talk to it.What does she see?They arrived at the end of the corridor and the closed door again, and turned around again.Information?A slim chance to learn something?Or maybe just the chance to get attention?Joel was getting to know Ruby.Shes brave, Onor said.And she wants the best for us.She would fight anything.Joel laughed, his laughter bigger and richer and more relaxed than Onor imagined it possible to feel at the moment.Shes not trying to fight it.Shes trying to talk to it.Onors laugh was much more controlled.Words are her most powerful weapon.She acts like she thinks its alive.Could it be?Thinking?I didnt think so at the time.The damn things metal.He paused, remembering it.I dont like Ruby so near the thing, even if its tied down.I have protection in there.They walked a while longer in silence, so far that Onor grew thirsty.Once again, it was Joel who broke the silence, and once more it was with a question instead of an order.Should we feel as afraid of Adiamo as you felt about the spider?Onor bit back his first instinct, which was to say of course they should.Maybe we shouldnt trust Diamond Deep yet.But surely the entire system cannot be hostile.Joel stopped and turned to look at Onor.Why not?Because we came from here.Joel didnt respond until they had made another complete walk and turn.You and Ruby are two bridges I trust between us and the working people.Onor felt surprised to be included.Thank you.Are they afraid?Of course they are.I want you to go and find Conroy and The Jackman, and tell them to start the drills again, and the practice sessions.These arent to be secret any more.Right alongside the classes Ruby and Ix plan to offer about Adiamo, we will re form an army of workers, just like the army that you all built before.Only this time it will be formal, and it will be trained, and it will even be armed.Even if we never need it, the act of making an army will soothe the ship.Training keeps people occupied.Onor liked the idea.Is there anything else you want me to tell them?Yes.Tell them we need them.Thank you, Onor said.Theyll be glad to hear that.25     To Rubys surprise, the robot repair shop smelled good to her.She had hated it as a child, wanted to be free of it, fought for just that.And now the clean and old oils, degreasers, and newly washed rags all smelled like home.Shed worn the worst clothes she ownedan old pair of blue pants and a gray shirt shed asked Jali to dig up for her when she was recording a song about being in the working class.The irony of her dress wasnt lost on her.Four technicians surrounded the table.Two of them were from KJs team of spider dancers, and the other two were robot mechanics.One man, one woman, both of them scarred on the hands and arms from wrestling with sharp metal tools and parts every day, both dirty.They greeted her as if they were in awe, voices hushed.The woman was Frieda and the man Allo.Shed met Allo when she was a young apprentice, maybe twelve.He had looked big and successful to her then, like something she might become someday.I met you once.You were teaching us about welding safely.His eyes rounded.I dont remember.I was young.You were a good teacher, Allo.He looked so pleased at her words that she was glad shed remembered his name.A wall had been knocked out between two workshops to make enough space for the whole robot leg to spread across long tables.Ruby stared at it, distaste welling in her throat.Pick it up, Frieda suggested.The leg?It was huge.Yes.Ruby braced and extended her arms, tensed, lifted.And came fully to standing as if she had been bounced.Wow.How can it be so strong?Its material weve never seen here, Allo said.Ruby addressed one of the robot dancers.What about the middle of it?Were you able to go back and get that?Over here.Over here actually meant in a different, smaller room, on a normal sized table, and with lights shining on it from all angles.It was still in its cage.Here, separated from the surrounding power of legs and great clawed arms, it was even harder to imagine that it had any structural significance.It could only be controls.Is this made out of the same material?Allo said, Just the cage.The thing inside of it is soft.Poke it.Her arm was slender enough to fit through the protective bars, and so she reached in and touched the surface.Cool.Hard.It dented slightly under her finger, but she wouldnt have had the strength to poke a hole in the surface.It didnt feel at all vulnerable.Just ...different.Slightly greasy and entirely unfamiliar, even creepy.This time, she found a freshly cleaned suit outside the airlock.It fit her as if shed been measured for it.Thank you, she said.KJ smiled.You wont be able to tell me you cant see through that glass.Its not as if the air isnt good.Whats going to happen?The sky could fall.Enemies could find a way to change the mix of oxygen.Besides, it might be harder for the robot to snip off your pretty little head if you have your helmet covering it.She laughed at his list of fears.Ill try and resist my natural predilection for stupidity.You do that.KJ was laughing, too.When you were afraid, she thought, laughter was a good thing.Back at the bottom of the traverse, the robot still towered over her.Ix addressed her, using a communication channel that didnt broadcast out loud.It has been asking me questions.And have you answered?Ruby asked it.If the question was something factual about the ship.KJ gave me permission to do that.So you answer to KJ but not to me, Ruby teased.KJ is Joels chief strategist.She didnt bother to ask what the damned machine thought she was.KJ suggested I convince the robot that we have in fact killed the ship it came from.And did you?Yes.It wants to talk to you now.KJ must have known.This explained the new, clean suit.She swallowed and took a deep breath, regretting the promise to leave her helmet on.Are you recording?Yes.Go ahead and broadcast.She stared at the robot, wishing there was a way to look into its eyes.Or that it had eyes to look at.What should I call you?Im Ruby.This time the answer was immediate.Aleesi.She had been expecting a stream of numbers or something.Thats pretty.That was my human name.It was Rubys turn for a slight hesitation.A human named you?My mother.I was a girl once.Ruby drew in a sharp breath and clutched the traverse line harder.Aleesi continued.That is why we live at the Edge of the worlds.So the thing she had felt this morning was a brain.She felt good.The beast wasnt merely alive.It was human.She had been right.More than right.KJ regathered his sense of equilibrium first.But you do not look human now.I am not one thing.Well that was clear.Why does having been human mean you live at the edge?We are ...not allowed in human space.Why?she pushed.I have not died.The inner worlds consider death an absolute.It can take a long time, but it must happen.Thus only full biologicals have rights, and I am an abomination.So you dont have to die?KJ looked curious.This instance of me can die.Thats likely, now.Being part of my ship was my protection.Ruby wasnt quite ready to feel sorry for it ...her.You came here to kill us.She saw Colins face again, heard his voice teasing her.Remembered a kiss, from a time before she met Joel.You killed a man who I liked very much.We did what we were told by the controlling voices.We came here to survive.The way to change and grow is to gather new things, to have materials and knowledge that no one else does.Even if it belongs to someone else?Ruby asked.Who owns The Creative Fire?The people who sent it away are long dead and they have no children with the power of such a long remembrance.Ruby glanced at KJ reflexively.She couldnt see his face clearly through the helmet, but his eyes had narrowed and he looked stiff.So how will you survive now?he asked.Will you adapt to us, or will you kill us if we untie you?There is no reason to kill you now.We consider the ship ours, Ruby said.The spider didnt offer an answer to that.After a few long moments of silence, Ruby asked, Why are you in danger?You will kill me or the people inside the system will kill me.Aleesi sounded matter of fact about it.Ruby couldnt tell if the machine felt fear since Ix used a robotic voice to translate Aleesis words.We will not kill you if we dont give us a reason, Ruby said.Her words earned a sharp look from KJ, so she added, I mean that.KJ didnt challenge Ruby, but changed the subject.Why?Why would people inside kill you?Because I am not allowed inside, and you are bringing me there.I am in five other machines on my home ship.If it lives, they live.I may yet live in those, but I cannot talk to any of my selves.No one answers.The first day, when I was alone hereafter the deaths of the others.A pause.The first hours after, I could hear my other selves on the Thief of a Thousand Stars.Now I cannot.We are too far away.Im sure I never will.I have chosen to talk to you because to be alone is to die before my time.I dont know how to be alone.The translated voice still showed no emotion, but this time there was no mistaking the feeling in the words.Ruby forced herself to let her hands unclench from the traverse line.She sucked at her water straw.The implications of Aleesis story whirled through her head.There was cruelty and opportunity, and more hints that they should fear going home.Have you always been at the Edge?I started inside, but I was bought and sold and bought and sold.There is a black market in things like me.You were human and they sold you?I was born of a human, my inner seed is human.But I am more.And anything rare has value in the inner worlds.You will see.You will be rare.Fear crept in through Rubys indignation.She would find a way to be sure no one on the Fire ever became part of a slave market.She said, Go on.Tell the rest of it.Eventually a man on the Thief of a Thousand Stars bought me, and then, while I was still young enough to adapt, they stuck me in here.When you go back, and I get caught, theyll kill me.Joels voice startled her, tinny but serious as it poured through the speakers in her helmet.Ask it about Diamond Deep.Or other places.See what it will tell us about where we are going.She hadnt known he was listening.She didnt like it, but at the same time, feeling like he was there with her warmed her.She whispered back, trusting Ix to route her words correctly.I will.She raised her voice.Aleesi.Tell me about the inside.The inside hates us.They are united against any human/machine hybrid that includes a human mind.The inside hates others, too.We growthe Edgewhen people flee the inside.There is one government and many.What is the most powerful place inside?The Diamond Deep.By far.We call it the station that rules the planets.And what is it like?They hate us.Aleesi was answering from its own narrow point of view.She exchanged another glance with KJ, noting he looked more puzzled than startled.What is inside?he asked.Humans.Planets.The enforcers who come out to hurt us come from inside.A friend on the Thief of a Thousand Stars told me there are a few good things on the planet Lym, and in the place called Moons Refuge.Ruby sipped water from the tube in her suit.Aleesi wasnt sounding as smart as any grown human she knew, and certainly not like Ix.In fact, the robot spider girl wasnt sounding very formidable at all.Are there machines inside?Like me?Human machines?Only if they are hidden.But otherwise, yes, of course.How would you run the world without machines?But there are humans?The Diamond Deep is full of humans?The Diamond Deep is full of many things.Humans are the most plentiful.KJ spoke up again.What do you know about us?How did you know a way into this ship?I dont know how the controlling voices found a way to enter you.They gave codes to the ships that carried us.But I know that we found you in the library of history and that we know when you left, long before the sundering and the remaking and the blending and the Age of Explosive Creation.I know we came to you because anything so old must be a wealth of rare ideas.26     Onor hesitated in the doorway to Jaliets studio.Onor credited her with changing the way Ruby dressed and walked and even how she wore her hair and what she washed it in.He had expected the studio to be an explosion of color and perhaps chaos, but instead it was neat and orderly.Colorful drawers lined one wall, a mirror another, and a third was all hanging closet.Jali herself sat in a single chair that rotated on a base bolted to the floor.He had seen her in public at events and occasionally beside Ruby, always perfect and maybe even otherworldly.At the moment she looked like a normal human being: she wore a soft gray shirt and simple blue pants and low shoes that looked both comfortable and homemade.Her black hair had been tamed in a neat braid that accentuated her generous mouth and dark eyes.She wore no ribbons or jewelry except a single thin rope of braided colors around her neck, the universal symbol for support of Ruby and Joel.Come in, she said.Its good to see you again.Theyd only spoken in passing.He found himself a tiny bit tongue tied.Ruby talks well of you.Jali smiled.And of you.Did she tell you what were doing?She said something about developing a style.Jali laughed.Thats right.We want to meet our makers in something coherent, beautiful, and simple.In all of our colors.She appeared to be genuinely having fun, which might explain why she was so good.It will have to be something we can fight in if we need to, but also something we can attend a party in.She paused and cocked her head.What do you think?I think its a scheme of Rubys.Of course it is.All good things on the ship come from Ruby.Really?he asked.It was hard to tell if she was teasing, although he thought he heard a touch of cynicism.What about Joel?Ruby keeps him in power.You cant think that.He felt slightly offended.She laughed and rummaged in a drawer, pulling out a long measuring tape.What do you think?Ruby couldnt hold the command or logistics levels.Joel would never have won without her.She walked around him, as if she were noticing every detail.You can relax here, she said.There is nothing to guard against in my studio.Except for maybe Jaliet herself.I am relaxed, he replied.No, she said.Youre not.Drop your shoulders.Hold them back a little.Chin up.Relax your knees.As he complied with each demand, he did, in fact, feel better.She measured him and wrote notes, muttering.Then she made him move, so she could see him walk and stretch and reach into invisible pockets.Are you doing this for everyone?he asked.Im making the design for everyone.Daria and a small army are going to help make and fit the uniform onto as many people as possible.Daria and Jali might be natural friends.They both worried about how everyone dressed and moved; Jali just did it at a higher and more precise level.How are you going to get enough material?Weve collected old uniforms and found a way to dye them black.Thats being done now.Well, almost black.So were all going to be gray?The thought made him smile.With touches of color.It will be one uniform for everyone, with purple and orange insignia that spans all of the old levels.She held up swatches of colored cloth.Ruby asked me to fit all of her friends myself.The list is forty people long.She made a face.I dont suppose you have any idea how much time I have?I wish.Were actually in system now, you know.Ix doesnt appear to know where to go, so we just have to choose.I know.Im not sure that damned game described this system at all.She stepped back and stared at him again, a slight frown touching her lips.Do you like the idea of Diamond Deep or the idea of circling Lym?Ive always wanted to go to a planet, to have a sky.But apparently theres almost no one there.Are we even sure we ended up in the right star system?She had said it with a smile, but it knocked him off balance.The planets and the sun are in the right place, he replied.Theres just new stuff here, too.More stations.Ix says people have built whole planets they live inside of.Almost like living in the Fire, she mused.Well, theyre bigger, he offered.We cant do that.Live here.The Fire needs repairs.She paced.From the classes Ix is teaching us, we havent changed much.I keep thinking half of this place could be robots like the one that almost got you and Marcelle.A familiar voice came in over his shoulder.Did I hear my name?Come on in.Youre a few minutes early.He hadnt seen Marcelle for days, except on the exercise floor, sweating to Conroys commands again.She looked surprised to see him there, and perhaps a touch hesitant.The dark ringlets of her hair framed her face in a way he found enchanting enough to wipe away the slight regret he felt.If it werent for the dark circles under her eyes, she would look truly beautiful.Jaliet addressed Marcelle.Ruby told you what were doing, right?I love it.Marcelle came up close to Onor, put a hand briefly on his arm as if it was drawn there.Will you stay until shes done, and then share a meal?He felt the tiniest bit trapped, and guilty for feeling trapped.Of course.Im free for the next hour.Jali measured Marcelle and moved her from pose to pose.She managed to keep up a stream of small talk that included both Marcelle and Onor, to brush out Marcelles hair until it shone, and to pin it up in a way that made Marcelles thin face look broader and softer.As he walked out with Marcelle, he said, That woman could run the ship.Marcelle grinned.She could.I love the uniform idea.I like that well all be gray.Marcelle slid an arm around his waist.Youve been busy the last few days.He swallowed.I have duties.To Joel and Ruby.She fell quiet; not a typical state for Marcelle.She seemed to sense his hesitation, to match it.She pulled her arm off of his waist.Will you come down and visit us?Id like to show you the teams working on the new uniforms.We took everyone that cant fightyoung or old or hurtand theyre making the new material and uniforms while they watch Rubys classes.Did you set that up?he asked.Me and Daria.People in every pod are working together.Kyle brings food to the sewing lines.Theyre sewing off time, so the regular shift work still gets done.All this in just a couple of days?He and Marcelle were training with the old squads again, too.People need to be busy.Theyre scared.Walking beside her felt confusing.He wanted to hold her and yet didnt, as if it would betray Ruby if he did.He was wrong, but knowing that didnt change the confusion being close to Marcelle caused him.They hadnt made love again, but he remembered what she felt like, and how she sighed and softened under his hands.Damn.Are you scared?he asked her.Of course I am.Surely you are, too.He laughed.Im one of Joels guards.Im not allowed to admit it.Idiot.She deserved better than he was giving her.Marcelle?Yes.I dont ...I shouldnt ...Finding words that wouldnt hurt her felt impossible.I have a lot to do.Joels got me running messages again as well as being one of his three guards.Im not going to be able to see you a lot.She spun in front of him, stopped him in his tracks, made him look at her.I dont regret sleeping with you, Onor Hall.I never will.And I want to do it again.And again.She swallowed, her chin trembling even though her voice hadnt.You can be in love with a ghost if you want.I love her, too.I always will.Ill even follow her anywhere.But she has never chosen her partners for love, and she never will.I think she loves Joel.The words had escaped him before he thought about them.Marcelle laughed.She does.But would she love him if he had no power?He wouldnt be Joel if he had no power.Marcelle shook her head.You are so exasperating I have no idea why I love you so much.She turned and stalked away from him.He had been weak to sleep with her.Now there was this new awkwardness between them.He was pretty certain he was the biggest fool on the ship, but he had no idea how to change a truth that had existed forever in his heart.Ruby.Damn it.27     Ruby spun in front of Joel, holding her arms up, doing her best to balance on one leg.Do you like it?He sat on the couch in their living room, his journal perched on his knee, his face haggard.Every display in the room was lit up, showing one scene or another from the Adiamo system.Still, he found time to notice the new uniform she wore.Tell Jali she succeeded beyond our wildest hopes.Ruby felt pleased.I will.Theyre almost done getting everyone of fighting age fitted out.They plan to sew the scraps together for children and old people.Thats good.He returned to staring at his journal.She curled up close to him, tucking her bare feet up into the slightly long pant legs.The uniform would match her best boots.There had been no way to make new shoes or boots, so that part would look handed down in spite of their best efforts.But for a ship that hadnt seen new resources for generations, it was pretty damned good.You smell tired, she said.Of course Im tired, he said quietly.We all are.Maybe we should have another festival.We already had the festival of homecoming.What would this one be?The festival of ignorance?Is there any new news?He sighed.He pointed at the screen opposite them.She recognized Lym: a ball of blue and green and brown with white caps of ice.Weve found a few places in Lyms orbit big enough for us.Ix is pretty sure we can park there without damaging anything.But no one on Lym seems to know anything about us, or to care.Were better suited for a planet than a space station: we have ships that will let us land on one, Ruby said.He pointed to a small display that usually showed the map room or one of Joels secret command rooms where he held his councils.Thats Diamond Deep.They say we can dock there safely, but the first contact we had with them was a demand that we send them everything we have of value.I remember.Aleesi doesnt trust Diamond Deep.Smart robot.I dont either.What does it say about Lym?She doesnt remember much about it.Says its some kind of nature preserve and only approved humans can live there.She also has a friend who hated Lym.Apparently shes only got what shes heard to go on.I think shes being honest with us.But I dont know how much Aleesi actually knows.Sometimes its more like talking to a child than an adult.At least on politics.Joel fell silent, staring at the screens.Id like to keep Aleesi safe.Its more important to save our people than your pet robot.Pet girl!That didnt sound right.Damn it.She wants to live.Me too.Ruby laughed and kissed him.Of course.But if we can do it all, I want to.You always want it all.She kissed him again.What else is there to want?He laughed.If Aleesis told the truth, we have learned a few things.Enough.We learned that theres no one government in the system, and no one most powerful coalition or place or planet or religion or anything, although there are some universal laws and a single court to sit over just those.I dont like the idea of a court.Do you?he asked her.Ix had helped her study courts some on their way in.We could have used a court here.Maybe fewer people would have died.The judges would have been corrupt.I suppose so.She had been hoping he would stop agonizing and put an arm around her, relax a little.But his body hadnt shifted to allow her to fit nicely along his side and his elbow was digging into her.She stood and started pacing.We need to choose.Now.You said there are only a few days left, anyway.What are you waiting for?He shook his head.More information.Well, were not getting any.I know.Ruby mused out loud.Two stations and a planet right?We cant dock anywhere without permission, and once we stop, we probably cant start again.So doesnt that mean were better off with the planet?At least we have ships that can get to the surface.Ix thinks theres more political power in the stations.She sat down again, clutching her hands between her legs.Theres enough power in any of these places to crush us.Now he put an arm around her and gathered her close.She snuggled into him.There was a legend at home that we cant start the Fire up again if we stop her.Is that true?Ix thinks it would be hard.Starting is even harder than stopping, and the ship is falling apart.I want to see a sky, but I think we should go where the power is.She bit her lip and looked at him, watching his face for some clue about how he felt.This was big.Bigger than either of them, bigger than they had the tools for.But inaction was going to drive her nuts.As if he heard her thoughts, he said, We have to decide soon.So decide now.He sat still, staring at nothing.Its not like you to hesitate, she whispered.Its a big decision, but if we dont make it, Ix will be sure we dock somewhere.Its job is to protect the ship.And mine is to protect our people.He looked so torn.Shed never seem him this way.Do you want to sleep and make up your mind in the morning?He stared at her for a long time, his face so tight it was possible to imagine she could see him thinking.He whispered, No.We will go to Diamond Deep and throw ourselves into the teeth of a power we dont understand.Youre right about the power.Well be all right, she said.Were strong.Sing me a song?he asked.She started Homecoming, but he shook his head.The seed song.The one about how strong we are.It was a good choice.She turned off all the screens and all the lights, and sat beside him in the dark and sang.Part Three          28     Ruby stood beside Joel in the crowded map room.The air was drenched with the taste of stale stim.People completely ringed the map table, including some who had never seen the map room before, perhaps never envisioned such a large display that a hundred people could stand side by side around it.Ruby had held an art contest to burn the month spent slowing, and one winner from each discipline stood around the table with their families.One of the women was visibly pregnant, a sign that their reversal of the decree against children mattered.It made Ruby feel warm.Even Allen had joined them from the cargo bay, and from the amazed look on his face when he came in, it was possible that he had not been here before either.The ships strength had scattered around the room to protect the leaders: KJ and his silent dancers, some of the fighters from the cargo bays, and Joels bodyguards.This included Onor, who stood behind Ruby and Joel.Ruby assessed the crew.The new uniform had turned out even better than Ruby imagined: Dark gray with a multicolored piping strip across each shoulder, and rank insignia on the top of the right arm and over the left breast.Jali and Rubys aunt Daria and their entire army of willing hands had created a miracle.Daria was in the back, looking taller and thinner and more elegant, as if the simple act of working with Jaliet for a few weeks had given her new grace and purpose.Haric stood beside Ruby.She had put him on Jalis list of people to pay attention to, and his new uniform fit perfectly, although it made him look younger than Ruby had hoped for.It accentuated his thin shoulders and the smooth skin on his face.If only they looked as strong and well ordered as their uniforms.The people who had never been here before looked pale face and wide eyed, a little scared.Children were clutched tight to their parents breasts.This would be the first glimpse anyone outside of the inner circle would have of the Diamond Deep.Through some magic Ruby found fascinating, Ix had removed the pinpoints of stars and even the sun, Adiamo, from the image that filled the tables flat surface.An image of the station sat in the middle of the screen, no bigger than Rubys fist.It looked like a spill of colored beads had been spread across black, some lit from the inside in whites and yellows.Its shape looked as fractal as the edges of leaves.People leaned in, squinting at it.They pointed and talked.Look how many parts it has.A piece just moved.Its so complex.One of the children said, Pretty, and her mother stroked her hair and clutched her tighter.The girl was no older than three, trapped by her mothers fear, her little arms waving as if asking to be let free to go play.Ix let the image of Diamond Deep grow to the size of a dinner plate, then double that, and then double again.It now filled a full third of the huge map table, big enough for people to begin to pick details out of chaos.It was now possible to make out a variety of shapes.Each part was connected one to another, the outer texture and shape of the station appearing random.Darker blocks in a myriad of sizes had become visible at this resolution.Ruby watched the wonder on peoples faces as they realized each of these tiny dark blotches was a spaceship.Look at them all!Are any as big as the Fire?I bet that ones bigger.What are all the lights about?It looks thin.Ix responded to that last comment, which had come from Haric, by rotating the image.Haric had it right; the vast sprawl of ships and station was long and wild, but it was also thin, no more than two or three ships and bubbles of station deep.Is it that shape for light?Conroy asked.Yes, Ix replied.What Ive shown you so far is a static photo at varied resolutions.Close your eyes.Ruby ignored the machine and watched the crowd.Most people obeyed and stood with their heads bowed and their eyes closed.Here and there people held hands, including some she was sure had been near strangers.She took the moment of quiet to reach for Joels hand and squeeze it.His face showed no emotion, but his hand was warm and calloused in hers, and he gripped her fingers in a sharp hug before letting go.Nothing before thisnot even the ugly ship or standing below Aleesi and holding a conversation through the machinenothing had prepared her for The Creative Fire seeming as small as a seed.On the table, stars appeared and grew into bright points of light, and then faded as new brightness seeped from the corner closest to Ruby and Joel: the light of the sun, bathing the still rotated and thin view of the station from above, setting parts of the structure to reflecting light through other parts, so that only a small bit of the station was actually dark.Light even reflected back, clearly hitting objects on the far side of the station from the sun and coming back from behind them.Mirrors!Jali exclaimed.Almost, Ix replied.The little girl who had called the station pretty wriggled out of her moms arms and onto the table, standing over the space station, her face rapt.The light from the table bathed her skin in shifting colors.She didnt speak, but she reached her hands out and touched the surface of the table.Ruby took the opening.She sees an opportunity.That is what we must make this.Our opportunity.Our chance to grow as a people and to learn.The mother called to the girl, who ignored her.Ruby loved it: the symbolism was beautiful.We will take care of each other and of our children.Ix darkened the table for a moment and the child returned to her mother.As soon as her little bare feet left the table, it came back alive.The station rotated again, the sense of light remaining.Ix caused the image to grow.Here and there a part moved.A ship left.A ship arrived.The bright spots that had looked like beads with lights in them still looked like beads with lights in them.Just bigger.Some were clear and others clouded with swirls or color or full of things inside.Haric pointed to one.Tell me about those.I have been receiving some data from the station, and it has included a map.I dont understand it all.The bright places appear to be where the people who live on the stations instead of in the ships live, and where they grow their food and store their goods and attend school.It is like all of the rooms on the Fire separated and brightened and attached one to another by tubes.Some are not even attached.So we might think of the station like a big ship?Allen asked.KJ answered him.That would be a dangerous oversimplification.Joel cleared his throat.Diamond Deep is so complex that parts of it might always be a mystery.It appears to be the most active place in Adiamo, and to have the most people.It is only one of many places people live, though.We think they trade with each other.Ix tells me we might not even recognize the things they trade.We will be strangers there.Well need to protect what is ours: our stories, our goods.At least until we understand more about these new people.He paused and people whispered to one another.Ruby moved closer to him, wanting to show the solidarity they had been working to build.She had not yet made it into his secret meetings, but she stood beside him here and now.When Joel picked the conversation back up, he said, Well be docking there in a week.Diamond Deep is not still; it moves.We are still moving as well.Three tugships will attach themselves to us and move us into the trailing edge of the station.It will take time to maneuver the ship to attach to the station.Allen asked, Have you talked to anyone from the Diamond Deep?No.Joel managed to sound only slightly unhappy about this, although Ruby knew he mistrusted the situation deeply.Machines have talked.One of the men from the outer pods, a water system worker, spoke up.They arent all machines, are they?Like the robots that killed some of ours?SueAnne answered him.There are people there.Ix has verified that it is not a land of robot spiders.Ruby thought of Aleesi, who still sat trussed in a cargo bay.Joel continued.After we dock, well stay aboard the Fire.There will be a process of meeting and of waiting, a way to be sure of our safety and theirs.We will proceed carefully.Earn each others trust.We should stick together as one ship, one people.Ix will broadcast what you have seen and what the station looks like as we approach it to every display in every common room after dinner tonight, and will do so continuously so that each and every crew member can see where we are going.Some of you may feel afraid.But we are a strong people who have journeyed across the stars.We bring value to this place, and whatever we find here, we must remember our strength.Ruby raised her voice and added, We are people of the fire, and we will learn and grow here.We will create a home here.I promise you.29     Onor stood outside the lock in his pressure suit, about to visit the killer robot spider.This had been Marcelles idea.Something about facing their fears.Onor still wasnt quite sure how he had been talked into this.The last time he and Marcelle had been here they were nearly killed, and he had lost himself in her afterwards.His insides felt plagued with unsettling knots of fear and arousal that didnt go together at all.At least this time the suit fit, worked, and smelled more of cleaner than old sweat.Youll like this, Ruby said, Aleesi is a very social being.She was taken as a fairly young girl and put into her first robot body.She seems simple sometimes.I dont think of her as a child, just as someone who has been limited.She is used to having other copies of herself to talk to, and to being surrounded by others.I guess its like a family.A family of killers.Ruby already had the door to the lock open.He had offered to go through first and wait on the other side, but Ruby had decreed that Marcelle and Onor would go through first and she would follow.He suspected she knew how things stood between him and Marcelle, although she had never said anything about it.The women probably talked.On the far side of the lock, he and Marcelle stood on a wide beam and clutched the ribs of the bay.He had sworn he would be strong, but as soon as he saw the spiderseven trussedfear washed over him and his hands shook.Maybe it was a good thing he was in the damned suitit let him hide his physical reaction.How do you feel?he asked Marcelle.Are you okay?Im scared.But I wanted to come.I know.He hadnt.But you dont have to be tough.Coming in that lock was one of the hardest things Ive ever done.But I cant become a scared person.Youve always been brave.There was silence, then Marcelle said, I promised Ruby Id keep up what shes been doing.Learning from the damned thing.She says shes going to be too busy when we land.He glanced across the bay at three spider dancers, who hung on the far wall, watching them.Guards, in this case, but they spent time with Aleesi and gathered information.Hed read their summary reports.Theyd learned more about the Edge than about inside, but they were also getting some language and culture.He glanced back at Marcelle.Why you and not just the spider dancers?She trusts me even more than them.I do, too.He told her.I trust them with my life, but you with my secrets.She laughed, the first time her voice hadnt sounded tense since they cycled through the lock.They used to be secrets.The sequence of lights that indicated the lock was about to open blinked white and red light across Marcelles faceplate, and then Ruby joined them on the beam.Lets go.They followed Ruby down a traverse line.She had become so fast and natural in here that he and Marcelle struggled to keep up with her.They stopped at the bottom beside the trussed robot.He had been this close when they were being chased, maybe closer, but he couldnt recall details.Only fear.Rushing blood made his fingertips feel like hearts beat in them.There were so many chains holding the robot down that he shouldnt feel this way.Hello, Aleesi, Ruby said.These are my friends Marcelle and Onor.They may come back and visit you when I cannot.Well be at Diamond Deep soon and Ill have other duties.The robot spoke in Ixs voice.Pleased to meet you.Talk to us about the Diamond Deep, Ruby said.I have told you everything I know.For my friends sake.So they can ask questions.Just summarize the things that youve told me.Ixs Aleesi voice went off in Onors helmet again.Diamond Deep is the oldest station here, and the biggest.It was built as a project of a long ago government, started just before your ship left the system.Old spaceships that could no longer move, but which could be lived in, became part of it.The station survived the sundering by staying neutral and letting ships from all sides of the fighting meet here.Diamond Deep came out ahead in that, winning so much material and metal from fleet salvage that it was three times as big after the war.Then the nano tech revolution changed it yet again, remade it piece by piece, built the habitat bubbles and gave it manufacturing facilities.Ships are made here for the whole system, and have been since before the Edge was created.It sounded like a prepared speech or a memory of a lesson.But you have never been to the Deep?he asked.No.When I was a human child, I was on Lym.Onor asked, Did you miss being on a planet?Yes.It felt absurd to be having an almost normal conversation with something that had tried to kill him.I heard you dont like it that we came here.My kind is not allowed to live here.Marcelle asked, Will they know youre here?They will know everything about this ship.Ix broke in, using its deeper voice so they knew it wasnt the robot talking.She is very convinced that there is no way to keep secrets from anyone inside.Is she right?Perhaps.How long ago were you a human child?Marcelle asked the robot.At the beginning of the Age of Explosive Creation, which was many generations ago, even though it began after you left.It is when robots created their intelligence, and when humans learned to live longer and younger and where beings like me were created and rejected and fled to the Edge if we wanted to survive.So why are you talking to us?
