And then another landing craft descended from the sky, and twelve warriors stepped out.They were bipeds, roughly the same          height as Sharrock, and dressed in long red robes; dignified and graceful but with blackened old faces that looked like skulls; their beauty turned to eerie age.One of them fired a projectile gun without aiming; and a hundred or more tiny missiles flew through the air and unerringly          targeted the metal monsters we had been fighting.The missiles cut through metal effortlessly; moments later nearly a hundred blinding flashes dazzled us; and when our vision          returned, the monsters were ash.One of the robed bipeds laughed; a sound of joy that chilled me.See me, Sai ias, said the voice in my head, and the laughing biped turned to look at me, and I looked back.And I realised that it was him;          my Kaun; the one who lived in my mind.Come, and fight!shouted another robed Kaun, to the tusker army.If you can defeat us, you may have your planet.And          he drew a sword and held it aloft; the universal sign for a challenge to combat.By now only a handful of the tusked bipeds were left; five hundred or so was my guess.And most of them were not in plain          sight; they were hidden in the alleys and houses of this city, from where they had launched their skilful ambushes.But one          by one they all emerged, to face this new enemy.For they clearly knew this was something different.Now they were fighting their real enemy: the Kaun.I realised that I was paralysed; only my eyes could move, not my limbs or head.My Kaun was focusing on his own body, and          had immobilised me.The five hundred or so tuskers formed a disciplined semicircle, facing the twelve Kaun.They wore tunics of hide and metal,          and they carried projectile guns in their hands and swords and axes in their scabbards.They were clearly seasoned fighters.One of the tuskers screamed an insult at the Kaun; it was evidently an invitation to fight and die.And even though I could          not comprehend it, there was a musicality to the creatures sounds that made me think the words were beautifully expressed.And my Kaun responded to the challenge by stepping forward; and then he bowed his head, in a gesture of respect.Five hundred or more guns were raised and all shot of them at my Kaun.The speed of it all was bewildering; the bullets fired, my Kaun leaped to one side, and the other Kaun dodged and ducked          as the hail of bullets flew at them.Then my Kaun got back to his feet.There was blood upon his chest; a hole in his skull.He had dodged most of the bullets, but not all.Yet he had survived.And my Kaun laughed again.Half the tuskers reloaded their guns; the other half charged with swords and axes raised.My Kaun was undaunted, and did          not deign to draw his sword; his eleven comrades stood in readiness, but also did not attempt to draw their weapons.And then a spark of fire shot from my Kauns arm and hit the front rank of charging tuskers.They fell, screaming and ablaze.The other Kaun ran towards the tuskers, flames leaping from their arms like lightning that streaks across the sky, and more          tuskers burned.Then a second fusillade of bullets was fired, and some of the Kaun fell.My Kaun had lost the use of one arm; but still          he spat flame from the fingers of the other arm; the air was acrid with fumes.The burning tuskers did not scream as they          died, and no one had time to attempt to extinguish the flames of their stricken comrades.All were focused on killing the          Kaun.One tusker got far enough to lop the head off a Kauns shoulders; and then my Kaun struck him with a powerful fist, splintering          a tusk.But the tusker absorbed the blow and swung his sword again but my Kaun leaped high in the air, dodging the blade,          and landed with feet kicking brutally and the tuskers skull was crushed, and he fell down dead.My Kaun roared with joy; and for one moment I could see through his eyes.Two more tuskers were rushing at him/me with swords, enveloped with flame but fearless; and I/my Kaun seized a tusker          sword from the ground and engaged them in savage swordplay.Steel clashed against steel; my Kaun was deft and fast and graceful, but the tuskers were numerous and highly          skilled.I felt, as my Kaun felt, a surge of panic at the thought that I would now die, irrevocably.But a moment later I/my Kaun had recovered my/our poise and my/his sword bit flesh and the scores of attacking tuskers were          deadhacked apart then eviscerated.How does that feel, Sai ias?my Kaun asked in my head.The battle was over; the ground was damp with blood.The Kaun retreated to their ship, dragging their dead and wounded, but          my Kaun remained; staring at my body; thinking his thoughts in my head.This was a joyful battle; too often we hide in our ship and miss the true glory of war.Are your dead warriors truly dead?I thought at him.Oh yes.There is no resurrection for us; only for you, our children.But the difference is: we welcome death.Why do you do this?What pleasure can you take in all this carnage?I thought.Do not pretend, Sai ias; for you enjoyed it too.With a creeping sensation of horror, I realised he was right; I had savoured the glory of this day!And I hated myself for          it.Who are you?I thought.I am Minos, I am both artist and warrior; and I am captain of the vessel we call the Blessed Farol; which you know as the             Hell Ship.From that moment on, Minos was constantly in my thoughts.Do not judge us harshly, he said to me that first night.For we were wronged.Our universe was destroyed, by brutal creatures who cared nothing about the goodness of our kind; and             thus we were forced to become wanderers through the dimensions.We are victims; and you should pity us.Stop this now!I thought at him.Let us all be free; and stop the killing.You are deranged.What pleasure can you take in massacring so many?We do not do it to take pleasure.Then why do it?I thought.We only fight when we are provoked!Oh how could you think so badly of us, Sai ias?I was shaken by his words; the evident sincerity of his tone.Yet I knew that some creatures could lie as easily as they breathed;          and I suspected that Minos was one such.For we have only one goal, Minos continued: to spread the word of peace and love through all the realities.But each and every time we attempt to seed friendship and             concord, we are confronted by belligerence and rage and contempt.And soin self defencewe have killed very many species             of sentient alien species.But only for the noblest of reasons!And only, as I say, in self defence.You cant believe those lies!I raged mentally.I do believe them.You have killed millions of innocent creatures, you evil one!Only because they proved unworthy.I realised that he truly wanted me to believe him; and I marvelled at the pettiness of this creature, in thus trying to win          the affection and respect of his own slave.The following day I remembered the words of Minos when I woke.All around me, my fellow giant sentients were lost in dreamless sleep.I alone was awake.But something was different.I feltI          felt        And then I rose up and walked.I walked!And slithered; then I expanded my cape; and I spoke: My name is Sai ias, I said.And no one could hear me, so I said it again: My name is Sai ias, and I am free.My tentacles were mine to command; I could speak freely.And I could fly, if I so desired, wherever the winds might take me.The next day was the same.And the next day.And the next.Free!When my fellow sentients woke, I acted as if nothing out of the ordinary had occurred.I acted as they did; I spoke as though          possessed by a Kaun.I ate like a savage.I did not converse.During exercises, I was as brutal as I had always been.Later, I journeyed from one end of the hangar bay to the other where the Kindred dwelled, just to see what it was like.It          was not in fact so very different; except that the Kindred slept on wooden benches, and the stench of their unwashed bodies          was ripe and disgusting.When challenged by a Kindred warrior about my presence there, I said I was carrying a message to a particular Kindred chief          who I knew had died during our last combat.I was told he had died in combat, so I snorted rudely, and made my way back to          my end of the hangar bay, where the giant sentients were lodged.At the end of that long day I lay down and slept with them; or rather, pretended to sleep.It was, I knew, imperative that no one should know of my state of freedom.For there was no one here who could be trusted.The Kindred were pure evil; the giant sentients mere puppets.And I wondered how this had happened.Was it a mere accident?Or was Minos playing with me?Or perhaps trying to win my confidence          and trust?But if sowhy?And I wondered too what I would do when the time for battle came again.Would I reveal myself as the true Sai ias by refusing          to fight, and be entrapped once more?Or would I fight, and slay, and hence keep my freedom for a little while longer?And hearing that thought in my mind, Minos spoke:        You must fight, Minos said.For my crew know nothing of my gift to you, and they must never learn.But this will not be for ever.This terrible state             of affairs will not last for ever.Trust me, Sai ias; I implore you, trust me!I did not know whether to believe him, or to trust him; but at least I knew part of the truth.This, my state of freedom,          was Minoss doing.And I realised too that Minos had come to rely upon me, and perhaps even to like me, for reasons both strange and mystifying.For he spoke to me, and to no other.He gave me the freedom of my limbs, as a gift with no prior or subsequent conditions.He was the captain, the master of this vesselthe          king in effect of all the Kaun.And I was his favourite!And over the weeks that followed, with Minoss voice in my head, I learned so much about this ship and our captors.Minos          confided in me as if we were long established friends; as if we were equals!He told me that his ship had the power to travel          between different universes, not just between stars, though I did not comprehend his explanation of this.He told me also          of the sad history of his people, and their war with the evil Parakka.And he told me how he and his crew had yearned to make          a fresh start, in some new universe or other.But they were never, because of the folly of others, able to do so.There were only a handful of Kaun still surviving, Minos admitted.Once the ship had held thousands of their kind but war          and natural disasters had thinned their numbers.But only the extremest acts of violence could kill their self regenerating          bodies; they could not die of old age.That salvation, he said bitterly, was denied them.Many times, he also admitted, the Hell Ship had come close to destruction.It had been blown up, hurled into a sun, beset          with metal eating viruses, bombed with un matter, and in a myriad other ways savaged and brutalised.Each time the shipwhich is          organic and living, in some way I cannot fathomhas reformed itself.And the Tower itself has always remained intact.The          Tower, he told me, was the replica of a sacred building upon his own home world; The Tower of the Living Saviour, which for          some reason he reverenced.For many years, I had believed the Kaun to be immortal.But no.They can be killed.And many have been, over the aeons.And those that survive are few.They are tired.Their hopes and dreams have all died.Their loves and desires have decayed          into distant memories.And Minos, I believe, after all these aeons, is beginning to regret the many terrible things he has done.Sai ias?I am here.Tell me of your art.Art?Why do you ask?My people have no art!None?No poetry?No paintings?No sculpture?Our life is our art.Minos laughed; a sound that made my head throb.Good reply.We believe each child born is a work of art; thus, we raise it to be pure and true and beautiful of spirit.Even better.I did not know what painting was until I came to the Hell Ship.You have gained something then, in your time here.A ray of hope to be found in your otherwise dismal plight!You taunt me.Forgive meI was merely teasing you.I am allowed to tease, am I not?I was an artist you see.I painted withflame, I suppose             you would say.With my own body.I was considered to be a genius.And then you became a warrior.I had no choice.I often dream, you know, of giving it all up.Going back to my art.Giving it all up?You disapprove.You destroy worlds!I cant bear you to disapprove of me Sai ias.You are a murderer.I care about you.You are my friend.I sometimes think you are my only friend.You are a monster!Perhaps I was.But I can change.You can help me change.Can I?I would like you to.Thenyou must surrender the ship to its captives.And if you do, we will be merciful to you.This I pledge; you have the word             of Sai ias!You know I cant do that, you sweet souled beast.I wouldnt be allowed to do such a thing!Lyraii and Darol would not permit             it.You dont understand what leadership is.You cannot be a leader if others do not follow.Even so, you must do what you can, Minos.The killing and the destroying of worlds must come to an end.I agree.You agree?You have persuaded me.We can change.I can change.We can wage peace instead of war!If you help me, Sai ias.Only if you             help me!How do I know I can believe you?You have to trust me.As I trust you.Do you trust me Sai ias?Yes, I thought at him; yes, I do!Minoss pledge was extraordinary; but for me, it came as no surprise.For I have always believed in certain fundamental truths: that love is more powerful than evil.And that even the worst and          cruellest sinners can be redeemed, and brought to virtue.That is my faith and my philosophy.For a sentient soul is not a fixed and immutable thing; it can grow, evolve, become better and wiser, as truth and love are          absorbed by it.And my kind pride ourselves on our ability to turn dark souls into bright souls; to leach out evil and encourage          good.I was telling the truth when I advised Minos that for us, life is art; we have raised up many species into noble sentience,          and of this we are proud.And as for Minosthe new, kinder, peace loving, spiritually redeemed Minosperhaps his transformation may be considered my          own and greatest work of art?Minoss voice was in my head every time I woke from dreamless sleep.Wake Sai ias, its me!And it was there when I trained in the arts of war with my fellow giant sentients: Well fought, Sai ias, I am proud of you!Bravo Sai ias!Deftly done, Sai ias, you are a marvel!And it was there too for long portions of the day, all day long.Heres a thought, Sai ias Have you ever wondered, Sai ias, if Wont it be marvellous, Sai ias, when I wondered how he had time to run his ship, so many hours did he spend with me!It was clear that Minos relished my company.He depended on me.He loved to tease me and joke with me, and he savoured my          mockery in return.He came to regard meyes, Im not afraid to say itas his friend.I suspected that Minos had experienced precious little companionship and no love since the Hell Ship began its long terrible          journey through the universes.His fellow Kaun were desiccatedliterally withered with age, hence the black skinsand empty          of soul.They rarely spoke to him.They had no fondness for him, or for each other.Friendship was an emotion most of them          had forgotten.And so, for many aeons, Minoss life had been barren and entirely empty of joy.Perhaps, then, my role was to fill that void?I learned too that Minos hated with all his being the pursuing alien ship that so nearly destroyed us.He called it the Nemesis;          and, he told me, it nearly wrecked the Hell Ship once before, in a battle that took place in Nemesiss own universe.But the Nemesis was gone now; the Hell Ship had successfully eluded it for the second time.And Minos was resolved never to          fall into the same trap again.He will if necessary, he has told me, remain in this current universe for ever, once we have          formed an alliance with and befriended the native sentients.I could be happy in this universe, I have decided.Space was not black hereit shone with a rainbow coloured radiance from          the light of trillions of closely packed suns.The planets were plentiful and many were wondrous beautiful, for most had rings          that shimmered in the sunslight.And the entire universe was straddled by an asteroid trail that stretched between a hundred          thousand stellar systems, like a river between the stars.Are you ready for this?I am ready.I am so proud of you, Sai ias.Today, everything will change!This was indeed a major turning point in my relationship with Minos; and indeed, in the history of the Hell Ship.For my role          on this next mission was to be not a warrior, but an ambassador on behalf of the Kaun!As Minos had explained to me, instead of waging war, this time he and his fellow Kaun were going to negotiate a fair and          lasting peace with the peoples of this universe.Here, they will make their home.And in time, so he pledged, the captives on the ship would be liberated.All this Minos had promised me.My joy knew no bounds!Our first port of call was a planet populated by one of the three most successful spacefaring sentients in this sector of          the universe we were inhabiting.These creatures were airborne flat creaturessessiles who had discovered the power of flight,          and had then become sentient.And now their entire civilisation hovered above the ground, in the clouds and above mountain          peaks.The Kauns miniature cameras flew down to the planet and showed me images of floating towers of a soft soapy substance moulded          into flying palacesa sublime creation from these rare and strange beings.I called the creatures ShiBo, because they reminded me of the flying plants of my own home planets.I yearned to befriend          them.I have faith in you, Minos said, inspiringly.Go and speak to these creatures, and tell them we want to be their friends.I shall do so, Minos; and I shall make you proud of me.I could hardly believe how much had changed in the last few months!For the first time in many centuries, I was no longer          sad.I felt my life had a        purpose.And that purpose was to make peace with the ShiBo.The Hell Ship itself was rendered invisible, by means I did not fathom; and I arrived in the ShiBo stellar system in an illusory          vessel at the forefront of an imaginary fleet.It was important, Minos told me, to create the illusion of massive force, in order to pre empt aggression.Imagine, Minos had whispered softly, that you are visited by a single alien spaceship from a place of which you knew nothing.Wouldnt you be tempted to lash out             with a pre emptive strike?No, I had replied.Perhaps not, Minos had conceded.But many would be so tempted.Fear of the unknown is the commonest emotion among all the sentient species we have encountered.And a single shipthats both to be feared, and easily defeated.Too great a temptation.So our mock fleet will help us in             our road to peace.The mock fleet was flanked with battle cruisers the size of gas giants.It would indeed be a crazed species that launched          an attack on forces so entirely overwhelming.We arrived and broadcast a message of peace in the language of the ShiBo, which our advance party robot spies had already          recorded, and the Kaun had somehow translated.The response was immediate.All the lights on the planet of ShiBo went out, for ten seconds; this was their signal for Let          us negotiate.It was a phenomenal accomplishment; there was no artificial light on the ShiBo planet, but the plants were bioluminescent.The ShiBo had the power to switch their planets vegetation off at will.In the game of power, that was a point to them.I was accompanied by an escort of myselfa dozen illusory versions of me, subtly distinguished to make us seem like different          beings.This one had a blacker hide; that version was larger; another version had blue eyes not scarlet, and so forth.We          also wore body armour partially covering our segments, and a breathing apparatus was attached to our bodies.I was alone on this mission, with no Kindred, and no other giant sentients in the landing party.And I wasstillfree.I could          move my own limbs, I could speak; I was not subject to any coercion.I was doing all this of my own free will.Our landing craft departed from the mother ship, and we slowly cruised down out of orbit.As weI and the other Sai iasesentered          their atmosphere in our landing craft, ShiBo jet planes provided us with an escort; these were robot controlled, ovoid in          shape, with no visible weaponry.However, apparentlyaccording to Minoss research, which was thorougheach plane could dispatch a thousand bombs, each of which was powerful enough to make a sun spit and flare.I looked at my screens and saw the ShiBo world below and I marvelled.It was so very beautiful.The land was scarlet and bluerich          in red leaved plant life and criss crossed with rivers and patched with lakes and seas.It reminded me of my own world.We landed in a field of red, and my sensors recorded the death screams of a million living vegetal beings, and I regretted          the need to kill so many.But they were, after all, merely blades of grass, and we had nowhere else to land: there were no          rocky plains or deserts on this fertile planet.But each patch of ground was alive with plants which sang at night.The doors of my landing craft opened and I slid out on my lower segment.My illusory escorts accompanied me, and we made our          way down to the plain of grass.And above the grass hovered the representatives of the ShiBo leadership.Be persuasive, Sai ias.I shall.The ShiBo flapped like sails in the air, but I fancied I could read expression in the contours and ridges of their flat bodies.Do not be afraid, I trilled, because my translator was turning my natural tones into a high pitched treble trill.And the trills of the ShiBo that greeted me in return were rich and beauteous and I felt as if I had fallen into a lake of          music.My translator failed miserably to render any of it into intelligible speech, and I deduced that for the ShiBos language          was, first and foremost, an act of beauty.Meaning to them was secondary.And so I trilled back, as beautifully as I was able; I sang the low rumbling song of the Day Dawning, and heard it transformed          into bird song so delicate and sweet it felt as if my heart would burst from joy.My song was greeted by a profound silence.What just happened?I asked with my thoughts.You have just committed a gross error of etiquette, it seems, Minoss voice said in my head.Or perhaps, pray do not take offence, they just hate your singing?I come in peace, I said grumpily, and waited for my meaning to register among their flat floating brains.We welcome you in peace, one of the sails replied.Your planet is very beautiful, I told the sail.You are a vile and an ugly beast, you disgust us, and you cannot sing, the sail replied.That answered one question; this species knew nothing of flattery, diplomacy or, indeed, good manners.I am considered beautiful on my own world.You, by contrast, look utterly ridiculous to my eyes, I retorted, in the same          spirit of offensive candour, and the trilling swelled in what the translator told me was approbation.These creatures appreciated          plain talking.Are you the masters and conquerors of this universe?I asked, Or do you live in peace and accord with your fellow sentients?We live in peace and accord, said one of the sails.Then you do not incur my contempt, I said.We accept your lack of contempt without any trace of contempt, the sail replied.My name is Sai ias, I told this particular sail.My name is [what came out was gibberishso I decided to call him Sail], said Sail.We wish, I said eloquently, slipping into my role of ambassador with remarkable ease, to find a place in this universe          where we can dwell and be happy.We do not wish to take territory from any other sentient creature.We will not threaten this          planet or any of your kind.We merely wish to dwell here, in the universe of Many Suns, for all eternity.That cannot be, said Sail.This is an entire universe, there is room for all, I explained, somewhat irked by the brevity and rudeness of the creatures          response.You must return from where you came, said Sail, or we will destroy you.Stay calm, theyre just trying to provoke you.I cannot be threatened, I explained, in my calmest tones.We have travelled to every planet in this universe, Sail explained.We know who belongs here, and we treasure them all.You do not belong.Who are you and where do you come from?Oh come on!What an arrogant thing to say!These people are starting to annoy me, Minos thought.Hush!I thought back at him.Leave this to me!Theirs was a small universe after all, I mused; and it was no wonder these people were insular to the point of bigotry.We come from elsewhere, I said to the ShiBo.Another universe.But we have travelled here, and we wish to leave in peace.A trilling came in response; they were shocked at my words.Another universe?said the ShiBo, sceptically.Yours is not the only universe, I clarified.There are countless other universes, I explained.Then go to them.There is no space for you here, said Sail.There is, I said testily, plenty of spacemany planets are And then my spaceship exploded.The blast threw me off my feet, but the Sails merely rippled in the hurricane force gale.When I rolled back on to my segments and stood up on my twelve feet, I realised my breathing apparatus had been ripped off          in the explosion.And my landing craft was a wreck that burned brightly at the bottom of a deep crater.What happened?I asked Minos with my thoughts.They must have ambushed you!Minos replied with outrage.We cannot tolerate this!I agree, I thought, full of anger at this slight to our dignity.And then the Sails slowly retreated, and they were joined by hundreds more floating creatures, except these ones were encased          in armour and had what looked like guns mounted on their sides and heads.I was alone except for my illusory selves on a planet full of creatures that aimed to kill me.I braced myself.And the Sails fired their weapons; and energy beams struck usall the Sai iasesand we were engulfed in flame, and my illusory          selves dissolved in the blinding heat, leaving behind nothing.I shook the flames off myself and ripped away the last remnants of the breathing apparatus.I didnt need it.Fire couldnt          hurt me.And I was, by now, good and mad.Fear not, Sai ias, said Minos.For help is on its way.And then all hell broke loose.The ground beneath us shook, then hundreds of missiles from the Hell Ship materialised out of the sky.Most exploded in mid air,          sending clouds of flame downwards which engulfed the floating Sails.And some exploded on the ground, ripping apart the grass          and hurling soil high into the air; the wail of dying vegetation deafened me.Then multiple pillars of cloud wove through the sky towards us; a second fusillade of missiles had been teleported from the          Hell Ship into the planets upper atmosphere and was now hurtling downwards.I was in a field encircled by pillars of flames, beneath a sky of fire and ash, as the surviving Sails confronted me in panic          and mayhem.And I roared my rage at the Sails: You betrayed me, you lied to me, you tried to kill me!What is happening?said Sail, bewilderedly.Guess!I crowed.And my body sacs engorged and I grew, and I grew, until I was larger than the landing craft had been before its destruction.I was a black giant with wings that did not flap and who in this gravity could float in mid air.And so I floated up, and          seized the Sails in my tentacles; and I crushed them and I smashed them!And as I fought, Kaun missiles picked off the other Sail warriors one by one, until the ground was littered with sundered          Sails.There was no blood; the Sails died uncomplainingly; it was a rout.And for the first time I understood what Minos had said to me; we had sought only peace, and in return we had received betrayal          and violence.Who could blame us, then, for striking out and smiting our enemies?We captured one Sail; and forced it to watch the planet buster missile do its work on its planet.The creature said nothing;          its trills were silenced.That night I raged at the duplicity of the Sails!How could they have deceived me like that!Minos was right, I thought to          myself.Such creatures do not deserve to live!And I slipped into a dreamless sleep, still angry; but soothed by the kindness of Minos towards me.For I had come to admire          him so much.Despite all his faults, there was something magnificent about this valiant yet spiritually tormented being.And then in the middle of the night I woke from my dreamless sleep and marvelled at my own utter stupidity.For it was obvious now that the Sails had not attacked us; we attacked them.If a missile had been fired by them at my spaceship, I would have seen it; no, the landing craft must have been detonated          from within, on Minoss orders.Such was Minoss trickery.The next day, that thought was with me still.And I realised that Minos had for many weeks been seducing me, with his gentle and deceptive words murmured directly into my brain.That was Minoss gift; to make you believe in his          own skewed and utterly false version of the world.All his promises were, when I considered them for even a moment, preposterous.His lies were blatant.His corruption was total.But I had believed himwhy?Because I wanted to?Or because Minos had a power of persuasion that no mind could resist?Perhaps both.But I could not deny that I had been fooled utterly.Like the Kindred, I had become a willing pawn, rather than a mere unwilling          puppet.And I was ashamed of myself, beyond all measure.These were a beautiful people.Their hide was the colour of a rainbow; their heads were fanged with tongues that spat as they spoke; and they could walk,          but also crawl, and also fly and swim.And I suppose thats why I found them so attractive.All of us, every species, have          our own ideal of beauty, do we not?And I love creatures that can adapt, and metamorphose.And so I was mightily fond of the Krakzios, as Minos had named them.They were large horned creatures made of soft purple          flesh that could harden and expand and double them in size at a thought.They had no eyes, but could see with every part of          their domed heads.They had many limbsfifty or morethat could sink into their bodies, then emerge in an instant.And the          had remarkable powers.They could turn earth into a building material of remarkable strength by swallowing it, digesting it,          then vomiting it forth; and by this means they became space travellers in tiny boats of transmuted soil that somehow, Minos          didnt know how, defied gravity.I had hoped that the Krakzios could be our allies; but at our very first meeting, the Krakzios ambassador had admitted they were close friends and allies of the ShiBo, who we had so recently          exterminated.And in consequence, Minos patiently explained to me, they had to go.For all it took was one sentient species spreading sedition          and hate and our survival in this universe would be in jeopardy.You promised we would seek peace, I implored him.We have no choice, my dearest Sai ias, said Minoss voice in my head.And I knew I could not defy him on this.For if I dared to do so, he would revoke my freedom, and control my limbs again;          and the outcome would be the same.So I descended to the planet; and the Krakzios greeted me warmly.They talked about their world; we discussed the wonderful          variety of nature here.And I explained that my people had the power to fly through space without need of a spaceship, and          they were impressed at that.And after two days discussion, they agreed to all my terms.They did not at any point try to ambush me or intimidate me or          double cross me.But, once I was back on board the Hell Ship, Minos told me we would still have to destroy these creatures, despite their seeming          acquiescence.His voice was full of regret; and I told him that I fully sympathised with his dilemma.Trust me, his voice in my head whispered.They have to die.Of course I trust you!I said fervently.Minos, you are an inspiration to me!The rest was familiar: hails of fire; interstellar war; the planet buster missile.But when Minos was gone from my head I raged at his infernal treachery towards these blessed and harmless creatures.Minos you are an inspiration I had thought at him, with one part of my mind.But with the other part of my mind I had thought: Minos, I hate you, and I shall kill you, you destroyer of worlds!For I can do this: I can think two thoughts at once.Few species can, but my kind are masters of this kind of inner deceit.Minos thought I was just a foolish dupe; but now it was I who was deceiving him.I have a fresh mission for you, said Minos.Where?Which planet?I thought at him.I need you to return to the interior world.I slept, and when I woke I was in the Great Plain, looking up at the interior sky.I could see aerials flying above.I felt a pang of terrible homesickness for this world, which for so long had been my world.I loped across the fields until I arrived at the amphitheatre of grass.There I was to greet a new arrival, a slave Krakzios.It was, Minos had informed me, out of control and in an appalling rage.The Krakzios was being contained by invisible beams in a pit dug in the ground.I walked towards it, past the grazers and          the sessiles.And I saw Quipu and Fray and Lirilla, and felt a surge of delight; but I ignored them.For I had work to do.Release the prisoner please, I said to Minos.Are you able to do this?I am.Do you want time to talk to your friends?The grey beast died, did it not, after our ship was attacked?And now it is returned,             and does not know you?I have nothing to say to Fray; you are my friend now, I told Minos.Ah Sai ias, you gladden my heart.The Krakzios in the pit was suddenly free of its invisible bonds.It paced around, eying the height of the hole at the bottom of which it resided.What the fuck, said Fray, do you want?Sai ias, missed, you, said Lirilla.You will be quiet, I informed them all.I am here in the service of the Kaun.Quipus five heads were all ashen.A snarling, howling sound filled the air, as the Krakzios sensed my presence.Sai ias, what are you doing?I heard someone mutter.The Krakzios leaped and was out of the pit in a single bound.Its head bobbed around as it stared up at the bright light of          our artificial sun.Its soft purple flesh had lost its lustre and its colour.And it seemed to me to be amazed at the sheer          size of the interior planet in which it now stood.Then the Krakzios moved.It was fast.So fast, I did not even see it.Its arms emerged from its body and claws slashed at          my hide, and its horns gouged my flesh, and its tail looped around and jabbed my eyes like a spear.I was bowled over and came up without seven of my eyes, and with a bloody hole in my black hide.I was astonished.My body          was virtually impregnable.And my eyes are made of a thick gelatine that can withstand not just Cuzcos fire but also projectile          bullets and energy beams fired at point blank range.This creature, I realised, was made of some kind of substance unknown in my universe.You betrayed us!the Krakzios said, as its remarkable metamorphosis began.Its soft flesh now turned into hard ridged armour; it grew in size, until it was as large as I am; and vicious spikes shot          out of every part of its hide, transforming it into a weapon with legs.Strangely, the mouth of the Krakzios in this new form          was invisible until it spoke, then it appeared as a snarl across the front of its domed head; the effect was scarily disconcerting.Yes I did, I said calmly, remembering the promises I had made, on which I had utterly reneged.You promised us peace.We feared you, so we destroyed you, I explained.Die!And the creature lunged again in its new and vaster and even more terrible form; and I lashed it with my tentacles.A savage struggle ensuedI shall not describe itand at the end of it, the Krakzios was ripped apart.Its body lay in two          pieces.It whined and groaned.Your body will heal, I explained to the Krakzios.The pieces will rejoin.You will be as good as new.And then you will          surrender your will to the Kaun.Resistance is futile.You are defeated.We are all defeated.Our role is to endure our failure.The Kaun?gasped the Krakzios.They are my masters, I am their willing servant, I explained.If you had any pride, gasped the Krakzios, lying in a pool of its own blood, watching the shit pour out of its sundered          guts, you would refuse to thus serve.You speak well; she is a traitor to us all, said a voice, and I recognised it as the voice of Fray, and I realised she was          referring to me.Resistance, I explained again to the bleeding beast, merely prolongs the agony.I could remember vividly, oh so vividly, the day my beloved friend Fray first arrived on the Hell Ship.She hated me of course.She tried to gore me with her tusks, but was trapped behind force fields that could barely contain          her powerful bulk.So instead, she vented her rage upon me with bitter angry words.Words I had heard before so many times          from other new ones; and which I readily forgave.Fray already knew that she was the last of her kind.And although she was a brutal predator, whose people loved to eat their own young, her kind were also sophisticated and clever, and had developed a beautiful philosophy that treasured the          harmony of the natural world.The Frayskind had sent colony ships to the stars, at sub luminal speeds; and there were two hundred billion of Frays people          alive when the Hell Ship had come to their universe.A long war had taken place between the Kaun and an aggressive species          of sentients called the Mala.Frays kind had taken no part in this war.The Mala had been exterminated by means of a virus seeded by the Kaun on all their planets.The Mala had died, and yet all          the other life on these planets had survived.It had then come down to a space battle to the death between the Mala fleet          and the Hell Ship.The Hell Ship had triumphed.And after the extermination of the Mala, Frays kind had opened negotiations with the Hell Ship.A long contract of peace          had been drafted.And Fray, who was a leader to a large section of the Frayskind, had been involved in writing it.(Frayskind          were meticulous about legal matters, and although they had no hands they could use their tongues with great dexterity. )When the final document had been drafted, the Hell Ship spewed out yet another planet buster missile and fled, taking the          stunned Fray as captive and slave.She blamed herself for her peoples demise of course; and came to believe they should have          fought, and not sought peace.And, in all honesty, she was correct in her belief.Thus Fray had not been an easy creature to pacify, back then.She had tried to kill me; then she had tried to manipulate me          with her subtle logic, and charismatic personality.Then she discovered she could dominate some of the smaller sentients on          the ship, and used her power over them to foment a mutiny which, thankfully, I was able to thwart.I explained to her, again and again, that resistance was futile.But Fray did not believe me.So I had told her tales of my home world.I painted a picture in words of the great waterspout of Jragnall, and the joy of          swimming in the depths of the ocean with the Kasdif and the Qauy.And Fray told me her stories too.She talked of her homeland, a planet orbiting a double sun.It was a wild and windy and          mountainous desert world and many of the animals were, like the Frayskind, huge, because they carried huge stores of water          in their bodies which they replenished every two years when the rains came.They were in effect living oases.And thus, over the space of a year, we became friends.She was in many ways my dearest and closest friend.I bathed her body          with moisture squirted from my tentacles on a monthly basis; which for her kind, betokens the closest fondness possible outside          of a sexual relationship.Fray was my friend; and now my friend had called me traitor.You did well, Sai ias.Thank you.I am proud of you.But I fear What do you fear Minos?That you are not so very proud of me.Of course I am.You lie, Sai ias.No!Of course you do.Youd be a fool not to.Im your evil oppressor, remember?I dont think of it that way, I protested with my thoughts.I hope you dont.For what I have told you is true.My kind are not the aggressors, we are the victims.Our only sin is hope;             hope that one day we will find a species worthy of our respect.We were such a species.We did not seek war with you.For a moment Minos was silent; and I wondered if I had been too frank with him.But then he spoke, in gentle and humble tones:        Perhaps then we were wrong about your kind.Forgive me Sai iasno, of course you cant forgive me.What we did was unforgivable!Understand me then Sai ias.If I could travel back in time I would save your entire planet and all your peoples.For now that             I have met you I understand how wise and kind you are.You are truly worthy of our respect; the finest and the most honourable             sentient creature we have ever encountered.Sai ias, will you not answer me?I have bared my soul after all.I hear your apology, Minos.And I accept that things that are done cannot be undone.A staggering clich, my child; but true.Do you hate me?No.Youre lying again.Tell the truth.Do you hate me?No.Try one more time.No.I did, once, I hated you with all my soul.But no longer.That gladdens my heart, dear creature.Minos Yes Sai ias?What did you want to say?Just thisif I mayforgive my candour Whatever is on your mind, Sai ias, merely expectorate it forth.Minos, thank you.From the depths of my heart, thank you!For I have at times been close to Despair.I have been lonely and             desperate, in danger of losing my will to live.But now, my dearest Minos, I have achieved contentment!I have realised that my destiny is to be, as my ancestors once were,             the protector of creatures greater than ourselves; and that destiny has finally been fulfilled!I am, in short, proud to serve you, Captain Minos.Sai ias, I am so deeply touched; your friendship exalts me; you are the only creature in all the universes that I can trust.Ah Minos!You are my master!And, I hope, also my friend.Minos believed my every thought.That stupid gullible turds for brains fucking fool!He did not realise that my kind were accustomed to existing in a state of mental duplicity.For centuries we were the symbiotes          of the great coral beasts who bred us, and controlled our very thoughts.And so we learned to hide our real feelings; it is          a gift we possess.Ah Minos you are my master!I said with my mind; but my thoughts said:  Monster who deserves to die with agonising pain, I will deceive you and defeat you, somehow!And, I hope, also my friend, I said with the thoughts of my mind; but at the same time, my mind was saying: Die a terrible and painful death, you evil fucking murderer!I had learned, from Sharrock, three key principles of warfare: Know your enemy, cheat your enemy, and always fight to win.And though Sharrocks rebellion had failed, mine I was sure would succeed.For I planned to make myself trusted by the Kaun,          indispensable to the Kaun; and then to betray them, as they had betrayed the Sails.My treachery was total; for I knew how to lie with my mind.And thus, I began plotting how to overthrow Minos and all his Kaun kind.It proved difficult, howevereven more difficult than I had expectedto get Minos and his people into a situation where I          could slay them.First, I tried to lure Minos and his people down on to a planet to help the giant sentients in a battle, as they had done          against the tuskers.They were vulnerable once they were off the ship and on an alien planet; and I was confident I could destroy          them with my quills and tentacles, despite their power of bodily fire.But Minos and his crew were growing more cautious.They would not, despite my best deceptions, be lured out into the open.And I still could find no way to access their own and secret part of the ship.So next I tried to find a way to destroy the ship from within.I explored each and every room that I could access from my          cargo bay home.There were ballrooms, bedrooms, banquet rooms; this was a ship equipped for a huge crew who expected to live          in luxury.But I found no bombs, no missiles, nothing I could use to explode the vessel.The Kindred were armed with guns and rifles;          but those were no use to me.The Kindreds fighter craft were equipped with missiles; but I was too large to sit inside their          cockpits, and if I picked a missile up in my tentacles I had no way of detonating it.But I did however manage to locate a box that was used by the Kindred to send messages during their planetary wars.It was          a communications device that could transmit signals between planets over vast distances, via rifts in space.Quipu had told          me of such devices.So I took this communications device to a private place, an empty ballroom where crystal lights hung from the ceiling and          the walls were covered in wood that was black with decay.Then I studied the device and its controls, for quite some time.I experimented by pressing several switches in various permutations;          and when a light turned green I knew I had switched it on.And then I spoke.This is Sai ias, can you hear me?Is anyone there?I said.And then I waited.And, after a little while, a voice replied.Explorer/Jak Explorer, what can you report?Another barren universe.No trace of the Death Ship.Ive been thinking, once more, of Albinia.She was a fine Star Seeker.Im sure she was.Better than me?Ha!I take it that means yes.When Albinia was part of me she led and did not follow; her mind was faster and richer than my own; her insights more profound.When she inhabited me I was Olaran and she was machine and we both together formed a new and unified being; Albiniaexplorer.Yeah I get it.You had the best of her.Did you love her?You know that isnt a valid question; I am not capable of love.Did she love you?Oh yes.Really?Completely and absolutely; it was an emotional giving of such intensity it almost overwhelmed me.That is why I missed her          so much; she was the love in me.I guess I got the shitty end of that bargain.I am sure she loved you too.Do you really think so?It is entirely possible; though in fact she never said so.I loved Albinia with all my being; but I could never tell if she felt the same.Or if she just needed an Olaran who would             let her cry on his shoulder from time to time.There is no way of knowing for certain whether or not she loved you.I am aware of that.I have been obsessively thinking about this for thousands of years; did you really suppose I was not aware             of that?I was beautiful once, you know.Now I am crippled and scarred and connected to a machine.Self pity is not helpful; I have heard all this before.I was elegant.My poise was exquisite.Dont torture yourself.A poem?Would you like to hear a poem?My circuits do not allow me to answer you with any candour.Nevertheless, I shall operate an over ride: NO I DO NOT WANT TO          HEAR A GODSFORSAKEN POEM.I have trillions of them in my data archive, which I access every day.Songs and lost laments and          poems and novels and memoirs.All saying the same thing: pity me, I am sentient and I do not want to die.You are a hard hearted bitch, Explorer.You assume that I am female.Are you not?The concept does not apply.We could simply stop.Would oblivion be so bad?It might be preferable to hearing you whine, millennium upon millennium.Do you get bored?Or depressed?Wouldnt you like to end it all?I would like to end, if at all possible, your eternal yammering.At times you sound almost Olaran.Youre pretending to have a personality, arent you?To save my sanity.If my objective were to save your sanity, I would have failed long ago.Those days are gone.Im sane again now.Do you really think so?Im functionally sane.I live for one thing only.That kind of obsessiveness is not good for the soul.I used to have a richer life, you know.I achieved a balance between pleasure and work.Prided myself on it!Even in our days             exploring space, there was always time for leisure, and games and chat.Morval and I, we spent many happy hours bitching and             grumbling at each other, for such are among the greatest pleasures known to sentients.And I used to taunt and tease Phylas;             and talk about philosophy with Albinia.Even Galamea, hard bitch as she was, was my companion and we knew each other; and             through knowing each other became more truly alive.Now I feel as if Im talking to myself.You pretend to have a personality, but you have none such.You are just a computer             program; and I pilot the ship through your interfaces and sensors and controls; and I am the only Olaran left in all the universes.Can there be anything more truly Im getting a signal.A data cache?No, an actual signal.On our riftband channel.A signal from a sentient entity who must, at some point, have become quantum entangled          with our atoms.This is someone we have met, or who has met us.Thats impossible.The signal has gone.No, its back; listen to the message, Jak: This is Sai ias, can you hear me?Is anyone there?Hell Ship           The Riftband Link Sai ias: This is Sai ias, can you hear me?Is there anyone there?Explorer 410: Your signal is received.Please confirm identity and give location.Sai ias: I can hear you!Explorer 410: Identify your vessel and planet of origin, and your intentions.Sai ias: I can hear you.This is astonishing.Explorer 410: Identify your vessel and planet of origin, and your intentions.Sai ias: Who are you?Explorer 410: Identify yourself please.Sai ias: Who are you?How do I know I can trust you?Explorer 410: Our intentions are peaceful.Identify yourself please.Sai ias: My name is Sai ias.I have stolen a Kaun communication device, to send a message to their enemies.And your voice is the             first thing I heard.Explorer 410: Please give me your coordinates.Sai ias: I dont know my coordinates.I dont know what a coordinate is.I have been serving the Kaun for some time now, they have             come to trust me.I live in the ships outer hull, in a hangar whereno matter, its a long story: this is a miracle!Explorer 410: Its an interstellar riftband radio, theres nothing miraculous about it.Sai ias: Theres a delay between the machine receiving the signal, and me hearing these words.Why is that?Explorer 410: Identify your ship and planet of origin.Sai ias: Answer my question please, strange voice.Is it a delay because were in different places?Where are you?How far away are             you?Explorer 410: The delay is caused by the translator.Your language is already in our archive, along with many others; but it takes a while             to translate.We have very many languages in our archive, from those civilisations destroyed by the Death Ship.And we wish             to learn how you have survived.But be patient please.Do not reply until you have fully assimilated my message.The delay             is not           Sai ias: You know my language?How?Explorer 410: Youre doing it again; you are overlapping my message.You must not speak until the full signal has been received.The protocol             is Sai ias: I must not speak?!Who tells me not to speak?I have lived as a slave for many Explorer 410: This is not the correct protocol, repeat, this is not the correct protocol.Be patient, observe the protocol, for this communication             could be interrupted at any moment.I now need to explain my mission.I am from another world.A world far from yours, in             every respect.My people, or rather our people, for I am part oflong story, not necessary to recount ithave technologies             which           Sai ias: You talk but you do not listen.I am not sure that I like you greatly, strange voice from far away.Explorer 410: are far in excess of yours, but you should not regard us as a threat.What do you mean you do not like me?Sai ias: You are ill mannered.Explorer 410: As you see, I have paused for sufficient time to allow your last message to be heard in full, and to prove to you that I am             not ill mannered.That is the correct protocol.I apologise if I have offended you, please take into account the fact I come             from a different culture and there may be differences between us in terms of our definition of good manners.Sai ias: Not so.I have befriended creatures from a thousand thousand thousand different cultures, and all of them would consider YOU             to be rude.Explorer 410: Forgive me.Sai ias: You are forgiven.Explorer 410: My name is Explorer 410.I am an amalgam organic/non organic entity of a kind I would imagine is unfamiliar to your culture             and I am honoured to make contact with you.I am privileged to be conversing with you and I freely concede that you have every             right to be heard and not interrupted all the time.Our kind are Traders, and the organic part of me prides himself on his             courtesy and diplomacy, but it has been many years since he engaged with a fellow organic entity and he is therefore leaving             all the talking to me.I now shall pause, to allow you to respond in the style that best befits your social etiquette.Sai ias: Your words are a jumble of nonsense.How can you be two entities in one?Jak: Ha!Good question.I sometimes think that Sai ias: Are you Explorer 410: Property of the Olaran Trading Fleet?Explorer 410: That is correct.Jak: Hey!How did she Explorer 410: Let me handle this please and do not Jak: Do not interrupt, for that is not the correct protocol.Explorer 410: Indeed.Sai ias, how did you know I am part of the Olaran Trading Fleet?Sai ias: What are yousorry.I saw you.Explorer 410: How?When?Do you have a phantom control display on your vessel with access to camera images of our ship?Sai ias: Perhaps they do, the Kaun.But I do not.Nor do I comprehendI saw you.With my own eyes.Explorer 410: Please clarify; this comment bewilders me.Sai ias: I saw you attack our ship.The hull burst open, many of us fell out into cold space.I alone survived.And I saw you; a large             ugly vessel with a central striped part with EXPLORER 410 and all the rest written on the top of the hull.You fought the             Hell Ship and were duped and you lost.Jak: You actually saw that?Sai ias: I did.Jak: What kind of creature are you, to survive in empty space?Sai ias: I am a once amphibious metamorphosing giant sentient who can breathe energy instead of air.And you?Explorer 410: I am an artificially wrought machine mind in the form of a spaceship in symbiosis with the organic mind of an Olaran.Jak: And I amor rather used to bean Olaran.In those days I was, so Im told, rather cute.Sai ias: And there are two of you talking to me?Jak: Were two halves of a whole.Sai ias: Ah.Like the Sakashala.They have two heads, two brains, one body.Or Quipu, a five brained organism.Once we had a creatureno             matter.Those days are gone.I know a great deal about you, Explorer 410.You engaged the Hell Ship in battle on two occasions.The first when your universe             was being destroyed, and the second time was the occasion we spoke about, that I witnessed myself.Half a Hell Ship year ago             by my tally, which corresponds to one twentieth of my years.You come from a universe full of marvels and rich civilisations             who created beauteous artefacts of all kinds.Yet everywhere the Hell Ship went in that universe, they found planets trapped             behind what they call improbability barriers and inside those barriers were species of unbelievable rapacity and ignorance             and vileness, all of whom the Hell Ships Kaun destroyed in valiant battle.And the Kaun decided that you were responsible;             you were the gaoler of the evil species, and they admired you for that.Even so they fought and destroyed you, though your people put up the bravest of fights.And your vessel in particular was             heroic and skilful beyond belief, and Minos and Lyraii themselves were in awe of you.They were unable to defeat you and so             fled into another universe, but somehowthis is what truly amazes themyou tracked them down and tried a second time to destroy             their vessel.You are, for Minos and his Kaun, a legend; they call you the Nemesis, which is a term that means Inevitable             Doom.I know you, warrior ship; I know you, and I salute you, Explorer 410.Hello?Did you hear all that?Explorer 410: How do you know so much?Sai ias: I was told it all, by Minos.I have served him for much time.He is a storyteller by nature, he likes to share.Explorer 410: Are you telling me youre actually on board the Death Ship?And that you have befriended its captain?Sai ias: If by that, you mean the ship that destroys universes with all the casual cruelty of a child cutting an insect in half, then             the answer is yes.I am their slave.We are a ship of slaves.Explorer 410: And where are you?WHERE?Give me the star coordinates.Download a star map.I can find you!I can be there in weeks, no matter             what part of the universe you are sailing in.Sai ias: We are in the universe full of many stars.Does that help?Explorer 410: Not unduly.Sai ias: Im doing my best.Jak: Of course you are.Let me introduce myself properly.Im Master of the Ship Jak Dural, a male of my kind.Sai ias: Jak.I am Sai ias, a female of my kind.Jak: Im the better half of this beaten up old spaceship.Explorer 410: In terms of intellect, memory capacity Jak: Go fornicate with swamp, Explorer.This conversation is now mine.Explorer 410: Acknowledged.Jak: Sai iasthis ship you call the Hell Ship.Describe it.Sai ias: It is a horror beyond imagining, a vast and cruel fist of power that inspires all who see it with awe and terror.Jak: Without the poetry.Sai ias: Poetry is not one of my gifts.
