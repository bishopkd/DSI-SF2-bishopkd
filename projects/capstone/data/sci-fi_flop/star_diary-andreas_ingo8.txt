They need to accommodate thousands of passengers.The laser cannons are big enough to knock out smaller asteroids.The whole army is involved in the build!Its a question of an extraterrestrial threat!They have observed mans technological progress and now treat humans as a threat to their position in the universe!How do you know all this?Ive been at the factories and seen the ships.Ive had contact with the commanders of the various stations.And what role would you play in this?A threat has been found in the U. N!Harold interrupted, There are men and women on earth who interact in the alien agenda, trying to stop the arms race!The man groped for new cigarettes but didnt find any.He wiped sweat from his forehead and reached for another package.He found it and took out some new cigarettes.So the list you have  Yes!There is a list of persons who conspire against humanity.The motive behind this is not clear.Simone examined the man.She couldnt believe in the conspiracy, the space ships and the alien threat.What she could see was that the man was afraid for real: Afraid that his information would get into the wrong hands.Afraid that war would break out.Afraid of her.She examined the man at length: She saw his sincerity.Similar things had happened earlier in her career.She ran into maniacs every few months.Shed tried to do away with such clients.They werent so interesting.The only thing that was needed was a listening ear: A clarity of vision that resulted in giving the right drugs.When the clients came out of psychosis, they always saw things in a new light.Simone left the man and united with Christopher outside.She saw nothing unusual in the case and didnt understand the caution.Is he reliable?Christopher asked excitedly, Or is he lying?Obviously, he speaks the truth, as far as his sincerity is concerned, but the actual story I leave to others to ponder.Okay...Christopher said.I have the list.What list?The list of conspirators in the U. N.   Explain.I cant.Its just not possible.Come with me on a short trip.I have to show you something you havent seen before.* * *      They departed in a small spaceship: Now, only inhabited by themselves and a robot.They were going to a major installation a few dozen miles from the space lock.Christopher seemed to be getting quieter the longer the journey went.Simone looked at Christophers condition as her main obstacle: Obviously he was crazy on one level, on another level, he worked normal.She wondered what they would find, and wasnt a little bit worried about their safety.Finally she abandoned Christopher and sat down at the robot that controlled the entire ship.It was a sea of light from strange instruments she couldnt place.In the distance she could see the outline of the destination, the back illuminated by the setting sun.Being out on an impossible mission seemed to be a stroke of genius: Simone needed a break from the monotony of her hard work.Here she found deviants and dimwits: People who sold their souls to the space devil just waiting for the inevitable end.Christopher joined with Simone when the spacecraft decelerated and the massive destination filled the whole perspective.You wont believe me before you see the ships.Christopher said.And the couple donned their spacesuits for an extraterrestrial evaluation.Simone gasped when she saw the structures with her own eyes: On the inside, in an area of thirty thousand square meters, she could see the silhouettes of metal bound monsters.These were huge spaceships equipped with oval discs, which marked the difference between the upper drivers compartments and the weapons on the bottom.Simone used the gas mixture in the back burner to maneuver closer to the huge laser cannons and homing rocket throwers.Her figure seemed to disappear into the mouth of one of the laser cannons.She could pretend that she hadnt heard.But faced with the reality of the laser cannon, she wasnt quite the same person anymore.Christopher spoke to her over the radio and gave her his version of the story: There was no question of an alien race who would invade Earth.The space ships were an earthly concern to obliterate parts of humanity.The U. N.  had been divided into two camps, unnoticed.The list contained the names of the leaders who opposed the new empire.But they worked in secret.If the list were to be delivered the opponents would be revealed and the end would come.How did you come to this conclusion?Simone asked.Ive known about it for a long time.Christopher said, I cant reveal it now.What I know is that Harolds list mustnt get delivered.We must detain Harold until the threat has been eliminated and U. N has closed the factories.* * *      She was by herself in the tormented environments of the space station.Shed been shown to a room where she could sustain herself while Christopher and Harold conversed.There was a sense of lost time.The disc of the sun had disappeared behind the horizon; the earth was dark and menacing underneath.The outline of the moon appeared next.She did not know if she could trust any of the men.As far as she knew, they could be mad.The space ships could have been manufactured by some unknown purpose: Perhaps as patrons in a future colonization.Yes, she was kept in the dark by forces she didnt understand.She visited the restaurant where shed eaten only eleven hours earlier.There was food scraps on the table, flakes of corn and other provisions.It didnt feel like eleven hours since last time.She returned to her room.
