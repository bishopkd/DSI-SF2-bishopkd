Tired and methodical as their long crawl had been, whoever had been in the lead might have stumbled right on through the opening at the end.That would have been awkward.Because on the other side of the screen where the conduit terminated there was at least a hundred meter drop to the floor.The Sum of Her Parts     12 Ohmy.After all they had suffered, after all they had survived and accomplished, her reaction to the sight spread out before them on the other side of the conduit screen was more than a little inadequate.The climate duct did not open onto a research laboratory.At least, not onto anything recognizable as such.What it did open into had to be what the frightened Morgan Ouspel had called The Big Picture.Warmed or cooled air from the duct fed into an enormous chamber whose dimensions were so extensive that she could not see the far side.Pillars of metal and gleaming hospital white composite rose from the floor far below to pierce the high ceiling.Tubing and cabling ran everywhere, as if the pillars were being squeezed by a thousand chrome snakes.Blobs of unrecognizable composition and purpose linked pillars and pipes.Though muted by masses of muffling synthetics, the music of live machinery echoed throughout the chamber: pounding, screeching, and humming, interrupted on occasion by the crackle of powerful electrical discharges.Not a single person was in sight.Kneeling beside her, a baffled Whispr could only stare.Ill down Freddys firkin if theyre not making something herebut what?Try as she might Ingrid was unable to identify any of the machinery that was visible through the mesh, much less whatever industrial process was being carried out.And all of it hidden from the rest of the world deep beneath the empty Namib desert.No doubt the facilitys emissions were thoroughly blocked and secured from detection by passing military or archaeological satellites.Not that there would be any reason for any individual or company to run anything except a casual geoscan of this part of the world.And probably not even that since a discoverer couldnt exploit a deposit or excavate a ruin found in the Sperrgebeit anyway.I dont know, Whispr.I dont know what its all about.If they are making something hereIve never seen anything like it.Just like, she told herself, she had never seen anything like metastable metallic hydrogen.Her hand went to her chest and the precious storage capsule secured inside her brassiere.Its only a guess, but maybe this is where they make the metal that the storage thread is fashioned from.She could see him frown in the light coming through the screen.He gestured toward the activity on the other side.All this to turn out storage threads the size of a hair?Not the threads, no, she corrected him.The material from which the thread itself is made.And the implants, too.He remained doubtful.Awfully big setup for making nanoscale mechanisms.Maybe those are made elsewhere, from the metal thats fashioned here.Gathering excitement banished some of her exhaustion.In the research lab!If this is where they make the metal, maybe the research center is nearby.She peered intently through the mesh.I can see doors off to the left, on at least two levels.The ready, finished MSMH could go straight from here to a lab to be formed into threads, or implants, orother things.Very reluctantly he allowed himself a modicum of optimism.If we go back and try your staff doctor bluff, at least now we know what direction to go.He nodded toward the screen and what lay in the immense room beyond.Anybody starts questioning us, now you have a place, something specific, you can talk about, even if in general terms.Description validates presence.She nodded, her eyes shining in the dim light.As long as nobody asks me for details.They started back the way they had come.Not only did it feel as if they were making better time retracing their steps, the lure of discovery helped to motivate them both.I didnt recognize anything in that room, she told him as she crawled.I didnt see anyone, either.Not a mechanic, not a supervisor, not an equipment operatornot a soul.Whispr was less perplexed.So the operation, whatever it is, is fully automated.As advanced as that complex looked it wouldnt surprise me if that was the case.Still She sounded dubious.Its a strange kind of setup.I cant imagine something that big and important being run without any supervision whatsoever.Remember what Morgan Ouspel told us?He said, Ive seen the Big Picture.Its real, and it moves.She looked back the way they had come.I guess he was talking about machinery.But I didnt see any moving parts, either.Didnt he also say, Ive seen the Painters of the Picture, and they move toothey are not of God.I still dont understand what he meant, and I dont see how he could have had a reaction like that to what weve just seen.She shook her head.Theres got to be more to it.When were stopped in a corridor by a security tech who sticks a gun in your face, he muttered back at her, you can ask them in person.Muscles shouting and knees aching she waited patiently inside the duct at the end of their interminable crawl while Whispr climbed out the service hatch and checked the subterranean corridor where they had started.Confident it was as deserted as when Gwi had first brought them there he murmured an all clear and she stumbled awkwardly out to rejoin him.After so many hours spent moving in a hunched over position it took several minutes for her body to reorient itself, for muscles long unused to unwind, and for those that had been overstressed to relax.There was much to be said for the quadrupedal San Meld.She sat and drained the remaining, carefully conserved contents of her water bottle.Meanwhile Whispr was slowly working his way up the corridor, pausing occasionally to ensure that the way forward remained empty.Each time he came to a steady drip from a valve or the underside of a conduit he would cup a slim, splayed hand beneath it until he had gathered enough of the liquid to smell.Invariably making a face, he would then move on to the next.From where she was seated and resting, Ingrid quietly tracked the experienced scavengers progress.Retracing his steps, he paused beneath one drip already sniffed.This time he cupped both hands beneath it, waited until the fleshy basin was half full, and drank.Slowly at first, then with increasing satisfaction.Content, he let the remainder splash to the floor, returned to her side, and extended a hand.She passed him her empty bottle.Are you sure its potable?she asked him.Im no chemist, doc, but Ive had to drink a lot of bad water in my time.This tastes fine, and its nice and cold.That doesnt mean it isnt nice and cold and full of arsenic or heavy metals or who knows what.But I think its okay.Right now Im more afraid of going thirsty than being poisoned.He smiled.I figure I can afford to take a chance because if anything goes wrong I know where to find a good doctor who works cheap.After refilling both bottles to the brim he returned and handed hers back.When she slipped hers into a pocket of her pants, he eyed her questioningly.Not thirsty?He nodded toward the conduit they had recently exited.After all that crawling?She smiled.I think Ill wait to see if you bend in half in the next thirty minutes.He responded with a lopsided grin.How very scientific of you.How noble.Fumbling with his too large pants beneath the overgown he took out a couple of the nutrient paks he had pocketed from his backpack.Even if youre gonna wait on the water you better have something to eat.No telling when well have the next chance.He looked up the dank, dim corridor, back the way he had just come.After that I think we should get some sleep.Were overdue.She protested.Im fine.Im wide awake and Id rather keep moving.He considered.Okay.Well just lie down here and rest for a few minutes.Just long enough to let the kinks in my legs go away.She reluctantly agreed.Selecting a flat topped conduit nearby she stretched out atop it.The inner pipe that the outer insulation protected generated an audible hum.Lulled by its soft thrumming and the slight vibration of the smooth surface she lay down carefully and closed her eyes.But only for the few minutes rest they had agreed upon, she told herself steadfastly.Within five minutes she was dead to the world.SHE WAS RUNNING AS fast as she could; arms swinging, legs pumping, chest heaving.Behind her the hideous cackling laughter of the pursuing magified hyenas was growing progressively louder.No matter which way she turned, no matter what thrust of stone she tried to hide behind or stream she crossed, she could not shake them.Terrified, she looked back, only to see slavering muzzles trailing spittle that were like streaks of mercury and eyes burning with expectation drawing closer and closer.A ravine lay just ahead.Its sheer sided walls were unclimbable by man or beast.In her youth she had been a decent athlete and she felt she could leap the gap.In any event she had no choice.The nearest hyena, a big male, was snapping at her heels.Gritting her teeth, tensing her muscles, she reached the edge and kicked hard, scissoring her legs and windmilling her arms to gain distance.As she began to descend she saw that she wasnt quite going to make it.Arms extended to the utmost, she reached in desperation for the far rim.Her bare hands slammed into the gravel edged far side of the gorge, sending a shock wave of pain all the way up to her shoulders.Her fingertips dug into the rock and dirt.Straining, digging her feet into the side of the drop, she fought to pull herself up.Behind her she could hear the pack croaking its frustration as its members halted on the far side.She had won.She had beaten them, beaten the odds, beaten Something heavy slammed into her back.She could smell its thick scent, a combination of raw animal musk and the lingering stink of dozens of scavenged carcasses.Wrenching her head around she found herself looking directly into the eyes of the alpha male hyena.Its wet nose was streaking her neck.When it opened its jaws, jaws powerful enough to crack bone and draw out the marrow, she could see right down its throat.As it snapped at her face she screamed and lost her grip, sending the two of them plummeting toward the boulder strewn bottom of the gulch.Missing her face as she jerked back sharply, the ragged carrion stained teeth slammed into her shoulder and bit deep.Whispr pulled back as she swung wildly at him.He had been shaking her shoulder, trying to wake her up.Now he stepped away, his eyes wide.As she panted hard and sucked at the damp air the last vestiges of the nightmare wisped away like bits of shredded tissue.You were dreaming.Laconically he added, Bad dream.I know, I know.Hands braced against the cool conduit atop which she had been sleeping, fingers pressing tight against its waking world solidity, she sat there while her respiration returned to normal.Thankthank you for waking me.His expression changed abruptly, as if he had suddenly realized that he had dropped his characteristic sheath of sarcasm and indifference like a medieval knight shedding his armor.Yeah, well, I have to admit it was entertaining while it lasted, but I didnt want you rolling off your first class bunk and busting your nose on the floor.We got enough to do without having to spend time on cleaning up blood.He looked away from her and back up the corridor.Still seated on the conduit she stared at his back.For the briefest of moments after awakening from the unnerving nightmare of pursuit and death, shed had a glimpse of him with his guard down.In his expression she had seen real concern and genuine alarm.Fear not of her but for her.And there had been something else.Something deeper and more profound and far more agonized.It left her unsettled.The awkward silence lingered and grew until she finally spoke.Its okay, Whispr.Im fine.It was just a bad dream.She pushed herself off the conduit.It wasnt all bad.I actually slept some.She looked around at their surroundings.In the dark tunnel it was impossible to tell how much time had passed, how long she had been asleep.Had he slept?Or had he stood guard the entire time, watching the corridor.Watching over her.Were not getting any closer to our goal by sitting here, she pointed out.He turned back to her, recloaked in full facial mask and emotional armor.Was wondering how long you were gonna sit there and mope.Lets get with it.Doom awaits.Back to normal, she thought.She was not sure if she should be relieved or disappointed.They consumed the remainder of the nutrition paks Whispr had brought from his backpack, washing them down with cold water collected from the comparatively unpolluted drip he had found.After drinking they washed their faces and hands as best they could to remove not only the grime they had acquired while crawling through the seemingly endless conduit, but also the dust and dirt that had accumulated during their long trek through the desert.As for their new clothing, thanks to the electrostatic repulsion that was a standard component of all professional medical attire, it remained relatively clean.When Whispr had finished, she gave him a hurried once over.Youre the skinniest medical orderly Ive ever seen, but I think youll pass casual visual inspection.Remember, deportment is everything.Just act like you know what youre doing and keep your mouth shut.First ones easy.The secondI dunno.Had the circumstances not been so serious he would have grinned.Turning, he started off up the corridor once more.Hurrying to catch him, she put a hand on his arm.You cant lead.It wont look right.Im the doctor.You can walk next to me or behind me, but you cant lead.She waited for the expected sardonic comment.It was not forthcoming.He simply nodded, looked uncharacteristically sheepish, and fell into step beside her.How do I look?she asked him.Leading question, he murmured.Without going into pleasurable detail, Id say good enough and determined enough that I dont think the CEO of SICK itself would challenge you.She ignored the compliment.I mean, do I look like a physician?Or more like someone whos just trying to look like a physician?I dunno what a physician is supposed to look like.Lemme put it this way: if I met you in a hall and you offered me a pill, Id take it.Her mouth twisted slightly.Why do I have the feeling that if you met any woman in a hall and she offered you a pill, youd take it.But Im going to take that as a yes.She nodded forward.Is that a lift over there?He scrutinized the rectangular recess in the wall they were approaching.Looks like it.Better hope its not key or security coded or well be stuck down here for a day until Gwi comes back.Halting in front of the elevator threshold he examined the door as well as the wall on both sides.There was no sign of a keypad, security swipe, or retina scan.Just a single simple unmonitored contact pad.At his touch, the door slid to the left and they stepped inside.Ascending one stop, they found themselves staring out at a virtual duplicate of the service corridor they had just left.Ingrid nodded at her companion, Whispr slid a finger across the lifts control pad, and they ascended another level.Though more brightly lit and not as crammed with machinery, the second floor up presented yet another, cleaner version of the two levels they had already visited.It was when the lift door slid aside to allow them egress to the third level that they were shocked by such unaccustomed brightness they had to fight not to turn away or reach up and rub at their eyes.When her vision finally cleared, Ingrid saw that one corridor ran straight away from the elevator while another crossed from left to right directly in front of them.In contrast to the dank warren of automated maintenance passageways they had just scrutinized these halls were teeming with people.Naturals and Melds alike moved purposefully in all three directions.Preoccupied individuals strode past conversing couples or small groups with the ease of experience, secure in the knowledge that they would find their intended destinations without even having to look up.Their confident attitudes stood in contrast to those of a doctor and her assistant who remained standing in the elevator.Ingrid and Whispr had not seen so many well attired people in one place since leaving downtown Orangemund.Nearly as slenderized as Whispr, a Meld clad in loose gray engineers coveralls stepped into the lift.Giving the motionless Ingrid a furtive nudge and following close behind, her companion edged her out into the passageway.When the engineer did not bother to look in their direction as the lift doors slid silently shut behind them, Whispr realized they had passed their first test.Unmoving among dozens of pedestrians the two intruders stood bewildered, uncertain which way to go.Realizing this was bound to lead to awkward questions the longer they lingered, Whispr leaned down to murmur in her ear.Move, doc.Start walking.It doesnt matter which direction.We cant keep standing here with our thumbs up our asses.Somebodyll notice.Then somebodyll comment.Then He did not need to elaborate further.Striving to make an educated guess based on the direction of the lowermost service corridor they had just left and the climate duct through which they had recently crawled, Ingrid turned to her left and broke into a slow but even stride.After the long days spent traversing the Namib, every face was a surprise, every sound a revelation, every smell a shock.She had to force herself to avoid making eye contact.She didnt know any of these people and she didnt want them to know her.Any idea where were going?Whispr had adopted the perfectly blank expression he utilized when in the presence of police.North, she told him.I hope.If this passage doesnt break off at an angle or start to curve we should be walking in the same direction as the big room we saw from inside the duct.And if were not?Well stop someone and ask for directions to the main research center.She was only half joking.Several hundred meters on, the corridor she had selected was still running straight and trueand hopefully in the right direction.While she continued to avoid looking directly at any of the facility staff she was well aware that a number of them had glanced in her direction in hopes of establishing a connection.Each time this happened she found herself damning her most recent and excessively colorful cosmetic meld.Two approaching men were not to be denied.One was a science Meld.Maniped neurological storage created a smooth but not unsightly bulge on the back of his neck while each of his fingers boasted an additional joint, the better to help with manipulating intricate scientific equipment.His associate was a Natural, middle aged and mildly attractive.It was he who confronted her, sidling sideways just enough to block her path.Behind her, Whispr tensed.Though they had no weapons, as a professional riffler he was confident he could handle these brainjuicers without so much as a knife.The problem would not be putting them down: it would be what to do with them afterward.As was often the case, it developed that he was worrying overmuch.Afternoon, Red.An engaging grin revealed that the Natural was not as pure as he first appeared.He had undergone at least one detectable cosmetic manip: hed had his teeth pearlized.When he smiled, small rainbows flashed between lingering bits of breakfast.At least now we have confirmation of the time of day, Ingrid told herself.She smiled back.Good afternoon.She tried to go around him.He was having none of it.Hey, why such a hurry?I dont think Ive seen you around the clinic.Been sick recently?Well, no.The wattage of his dentition increased.I dont get sick.Then you wouldnt have much occasion to see me, would you?She looked back at Whispr, her tone thoroughly professional.Eric, dont forget to take a double antiseptic shower tonight.Im afraid some of those local cultures might have gotten on your skin.The science Meld spoke up uncertainly.Cultures?Yes.She smiled pleasantly.Were working with some derivatives of local hederotoxin and the stuff can be hard to handle.You have to wash carefully when youre finished working with the syringes because See you around some time, Redmaybe.Clearly alarmed, the Natural stepped quickly out of her path.He and his friend resumed walking in the other directiona bit faster than before, she thought.Youre learning, a pleased Whispr told her softly.They continued on.A pair of women in mechanics outfits waved as they turned up another corridor.Ingrid smiled pleasantly and waved back.Ive had a good teacher, she told him.The seemingly interminable subterranean passage continued to stretch out before them.With no end in sight she hoped as much as felt that they were still heading north.Occasionally a man, woman, or Meld would wave or smile in their direction.While Whispr continued to ignore all such acknowledgments of their presence, Ingrids confidence grew each time she returned a casual greeting.Maybe we can pull this off, she began to think.Given such crowded and busy surroundings it was starting to seem possible that anyone who managed to penetrate this deep into the complex might pass unchallenged.As they had surmised earlier, external security was so tight at Nerens that it might readily be assumed anyone present truly belonged there.She had become so relaxed that by the time they paused at another far less crowded pedestrian intersection she failed to react to the curious stare of the young woman who was walking in their direction.At first she thought the woman, who could not have been out of her mid twenties, was a Natural.Only when the tech came closer did Ingrid notice that each individual strand of the womans shoulder length black hair was in fact a prehensile manip.The technician had been melded so that when operating over a work bench, in addition to her hands she would also have the use of hundreds of long, thin tentacles controllable by thought training alone.By themselves feeble, when braided together the Medusa melds would allow the woman to manipulate fine scientific apparatus with the utmost precision.Excuse me, miss, but where are you going?Youre a long way from the clinic.As Ingrid hesitated, taken aback for the first time since she and her companion had exited the lift on this level, Whispr unobtrusively began to sidle to the womans left.If he could get behind her and get his hands around her neck before she divined his intent Research.Ingrid responded to the query with becoming swiftness.Were on our way to do some restricted research.Strands of her hair writhing like nematodes in Perrier, the younger woman frowned and gestured in the direction of Ingrids left breast.For a wild moment the doctor feared the tech had undergone some kind of bizarre X ray meld that enabled her to locate the concealed capsule and the storage thread it held.I dont see a clearance tag.Wheres your security glowp?Glowpglow pin.Ingrids right hand reflexively reached toward her chest.Challenged thus a couple of months earlier she would have dissolved in panic.Time and experience had instructed as well as hardened her.Damn.Mustve left it in my room.This wasnt enough to satisfy her youthful interrogator.Anyone cleared for Research is supposed to keep their security glowp fastened to their work apparel at all timesdoctor.Queen to knight four, Ingrid thought.What she said was, I just had this cleaned.Cant you tell its just back from the Laundry?The young tech leaned forward slightly, studying.There was no denying the freshness of the older womans apparel.Still Before she could pursue the matter further Ingrid added, I dont need it because Im not going inside Research.Theres a junior worker whos recovering from a recent bout of non acid dyspepsia and since Im headed that way anyhow I told him Id stop by and see how the medication I prescribed for him is working.Hes supposed to meet me outside Security.But youre right, she concluded apologetically.I should have switched my glowp over to my new outfit before getting dressed this morning.I understand.To Ingrids and Whisprs immense relief, the tech smiled.Id forget the obvious regularly if I didnt make notes every night.This place is really conducive to daydreaming.Then she did something so blessedly unexpected that Whispr was hard put to restrain himself.She nodded down the branching corridor.After youre done at Research youd better go back to your quarters and pick up your tag or somebody else is sure to confront you, Dr.?MacGregor, Ingrid told her without hesitating.Dr.MacGregor.Have a good day.Leaning to one side she peered around Ingrid.You too, sir.Stepping past both of them she continued briskly on her way.When speaking of Research, the tech had gestured toward the branching corridor.Inadvertently and unintentionally the guesswork had been removed from Ingrid and Whisprs search.Moving with renewed energy they headed off in the indicated direction.Ingrid tried to hunch over slightly, wrinkling her physicians coat so that the location of the nonexistent security tag would be less prominent.Because of her recent body maniping this proved difficult to do, but she tried nonetheless.So we know where were going.Striding along beside her Whispr kept his voice down.That still doesnt get us inside.An increasingly confident Ingrid smiled sweetly at him.Lets not get ahead of ourselves.One bluff at a time.Yeah.You did good back there.Real good.Ever think of working for a living by fronting for a riffler?Like you, maybe?He raised both hands in mock alarm.Hey, no chance!Youre too good for me.In more ways than one, he thought dejectedly.Pressure relieving badinage was set aside and they lapsed into silence as they approached a doorway.It looked exactly like any number of similar portals they had passed on the long walk from the service lift.That is, Whispr mused appraisingly, if one disregarded the subtle gray surface sheen that indicated the barrier was made of military grade composite and the three reinforced eight centimeter thick bolt hinges that fastened it to the interior wall.Not your average door.In addition there was a live human guard sitting behind a desk placed off to one side of the passageway.Dressed in the uniform of Nerens Security he wore a holstered sidearm and a look of boredom that bordered on the bucolic.At present he was staring at a box screen.The absence of a projection visible to anyone but himself suggested that he was enjoying entertainment of a private nature.Probably pornography, Ingrid decided as she and Whispr approached the threshold.Good: his thoughts would be elsewhere.Her companion tapped her on the shoulder and she looked back the way they had come.Conversing animatedly among themselves, three men clad in nearly identical tech garb were coming up fast behind them.Like the guard, two were Naturals.The third sported a reddish beard and a full lab meld right down to his fingers, half of which had been replaced with advanced techrap.From the fabric above the hearts of all three flashed a softly pulsing glowp.Nodding imperceptibly at Whispr, she slowed her pace and feigned conversation.Well I think youve got it all wrong!the youngest of the three technicians was insisting loudly.Interleaved suspension is not the best way to manage a volatile blend!Uh huh.Objecting vociferously the Meld wiggled the fingers of his right hand.Expensive biobond instrumentation gleamed in the light from the illuminating strips painted on surrounding walls and ceiling.And what would you do?Manipulate them manually?Depends on the composition.Ingrid accompanied her unsolicited advice by smiling dazzlingly and inhaling deeply.Six pairs of unmelded eyes immediately shifted in her direction as she allowed herself to be swallowed up and surrounded like a female humpback suffering the courtship of a trio of smothering suitors.Had the techs had tails they would have wagged.None of them paid the slightest attention to Whispr as he fell in quietly behind the trio that had become a quartet.Really?opined the third tech.What would you suggest, Missuh, doctor ?As she improvised cheerfully while managing to say nothing, the Natural in the lead leaned forward so that a scanner set flush in the wall beside the door could read his retina pattern.Simultaneously, a second and completely different scanner located below it read the information on the techs glowp.From within the wall a soft buzz was followed by a loud click.Only when the door opened inward and the technician stepped through was Ingrid able to appreciate its thickness and solidity.Flanked by the other Natural and the Meld and still talking, she positioned herself carefully between them.Meanwhile Whispr, striving not to be too obvious about it, moved up as close behind her as he dared.Absently, the Meld put his own eye up to the retinal scanner and his glowp close to the lower reader.Hidden motors continued to hum softly and the vaultlike door stayed open.Beyond, another corridor loomed invitingly.Ingrid took a step forward.Just a moment, please.Everyone turned.Having risen from his seat and his screen, the seemingly semisomnolent guard confronted them from behind.Ignoring the three techs, his attention was focused squarely on the only woman in their midst.Your name, specialty, and purpose, please, miss?Susan MacGregor, general physician.Im here to check on a patient.She flashed another award winning smile.Hes not contagious, if thats what youre concerned about.She turned to go through the open doorway.Your pardon.I must ask you to wait here a moment.Look, she began sternly, I dont know whats going on, but I have work to do and youre holding me up.We can discuss whatevers troubling you when Ive seen my patient and I come out.The guard did not reply.There was a commotion up the corridor.It was caused by the increasingly loud pounding of heavy feet.Half a dozen armed men and women, including two heavyset weapons melds whose left limbs terminated in large caliber automatic weapons, were hurrying toward the tantalizingly open doorway.Aghast, at least one of the formerly besotted technicians had moved as far away from Ingrid as the enclosing walls would permit.His companions merely looked stunned.I am sorry, miss, but in the absence of clarification I must place you under arrest.Leaving her, the guards glance settled on her companion.And for security purposes, your assistant as well.Ingrid launched into a bitter diatribe professing outrage.I hope youre as bored with your job as you seemed to be when you were sitting behind that desk, she told him angrily, because when your superiors hear about this you wont have to worry about being bored there any longer!This embarrassment is not going to go unremarked upon if I have to personally contact company headquarters in Cape Town!Having slowed to a halt, the armed and armored bodies of the quick response security team now completely blocked the corridor behind her and Whispr.If he was rattled by her indignation the guard did not show it.I would recommend that you do that, miss.His gaze dropped floor ward.While you are at it you might also explain why a company doctor and her assistant have chosen to go on duty pairing freshly cleaned clothes with remarkably dirty high tech desert boots.The Sum of Her Parts     13 There were five of the intruders.Maybe, Kruger thought as he studied the sullen, defiant faces, they thought that would be enough to overpower the security at Nerens long enough to steal whatever it was they had come for.First the trespassing floater and its crew that had been ambushed by magified meerkats.Now this.It was turning out to be an unusually busy month.Someone else might have found the dual intrusion diverting.Not Kruger.He liked things calm, quiet, and boring.Two women, two men, and one hermaphro.All Melds.Specialists in killing, infiltration, demolition, penetrationand more killing.They had been picked up several kilometers from the installation.Having been informed of their presence a curious Kruger had observed their approach from the multiple vantage points provided by silent, near invisible drones that flew well above the altitudes utilized by more common commercial searchers.It had been amusing.Watching them advance in fits and starts, covering their methodical approach with weapons drawn and ready to unleash narcotizing darts on any security personnel who might challenge them.Darts would make no noise and draw no attention.Oh, they had come well prepared, they had.The most likely scenario was that they had been air dropped by a silent superfast floater.Keeping them under constant surveillance and curious to see how they would proceed, he had pulled back his people and allowed them to enter the complex.There was often something useful to be learned from monitoring the activities of the unwary.Regrettably, in this instance the intruders had proved disappointingly predictable.Tiring of the game, once they were inside hed had the section of corridor they had infiltrated closed off and filled with a fast acting soporific gas.There had been no need to introduce anything fancy or expensive.One minute they were skulking along beside one another; the next they were passing out on top of one another.Both of the men were quite large and muscular.The bands that bound their arms behind their backs and their legs and ankles together were fastened to the wall.This kept prisoners upright.It was by no means inhumane.If they wished they could relax by leaning against the smooth bare surface behind them.Otherwise their range of motion was circumscribed.One of the power loaders that worked the oceanfront diamond shelves might be capable of breaking such security bands.Mere flesh, blood, and bone, no matter how extensively maniped, could not.The interrogation room was quite large, with a six meter high ceiling and four walls devoid of windows or decoration.Large floating digits marked the day and time.At one end there was a single door and a couple of chairs.Multiple vit pickups embedded in walls, ceiling, and floor recorded every millimeter of the chamber in very high resolution tridee.Members of Krugers capable staff had methodically checked the captives for everything from concealed weapons to incendiary clothing to intestinal explosives until they were certain there was nothing left on their various persons capable of shooting, stabbing, cutting, poisoning, or exploding.What was left to answer his queries were four people of different shape and identical demeanor.The hermaphro had bit down on a suicide capsule before Krugers people could get to him.Hello.My name is Het Kruger.I am the chief of security at this SAEC installation.You made an illegal entry into this facility and were caught.As you surely know, all travel into the Sperrgebeit is forbidden except to those who have been preauthorized by the relevant company department or Sanpark.None of you carry such authorization.Smiling pleasantly, he held up his communicator.Its screen was blank and its projector remained dark.If you were carrying such authorization, you would have knocked.Who, please, is second in command of your infiltrating group?Youll find out eventually anyway, I suppose.A slender Tibetan woman whose maniped gunhands had been unloaded nodded toward the massive, heavily maniped Dayak occupying the far end of the lineup.Sulok is in charge if anything happens to me.Kruger nodded and worked his communicator.From the ceiling a narrow openmouthed cylinder emerged.Emitting a soft pop, it disgorged an opaque yellow bubble the size of a watermelon.As the prisoners looked on, the bubble drifted slowly downward before angling to its right.Though the maniped Dayak fought and struggled with his bonds, he was secured to the wall behind him as effectively as if he had been nailed to it.Touching the side of his head the bubble hesitated, as if verifying its location.Then, despite the shouted protests of Suloks comrades and his own violent cursing, it englobed his skull.For a brief moment his furious features, slightly distorted, were visible through the engulfing yellow haze.Then the bubble ignited.This was followed by a great deal more screaming.By the time the flames had burned themselves out there was nothing left of the mans head.Seared carbon black, the top of his spine stuck up and out from between his shoulders, smoking like an extinguished match.The fire had burned partway down into the chest cavity.Exhaust systems hummed as the interrogation rooms automated climate control worked hard to remove drifting ashes, sootand the smell.Kruger stood and waited patiently for the survivors to exhaust their rage.Their insults and threats and unpleasant descriptions of his ancestry affected him like a cold shower: bracing and cleansing.When they had finally run down he approached the diminutive Tibetan woman who had identified herself as their leader and halted a couple of meters away.Though the bindings securing her to the wall were unbreakable by any known organic force irrespective of meld, Kruger always prepared for the unexpected.You suckling yak bastard!Evidently she was not quite finished.He raised one hand to his communicator.She stiffened and went quiet.Better, he told her.With a slight nod he indicated the stillsmoking corpse hanging limp in its bonds at the far end of the lineup.A necessary demonstration.To show that I have little patience with intruders.If you are curious, it involves a blend of aerogel and napalm.For the recalcitrant, it can be substituted for a meal.Acutely indigestible.Holding the communicator up to his mouth he noted the fear the movement engendered in their expressions.Purely from a professional standpoint, he enjoyed the reaction.Theyre ready, I think.Two figures entered the room: a man and a woman.The reaction of the three remaining prisoners to the appearance of the new arrivals was as varied as it was confused.Het Kruger was a type known to them: physically imposing, tough, lethal, completely self controlled, and dedicated to his work.But this pairthe prisoners did not know what to make of them.They could console themselves with the knowledge that neither would anyone else.They had to be Melds: no Natural human could grow so obese and still move with such apparent ease.What passed for clothing on their enormous bloated bodies consisted of colorful but untailored overshirts that fell almost to their knees.Matching blue or yellow pants accumulated in loose folds around huge feet that were encased in dark, loose fitting boots of unnatural height and width.The woman had skin the color of burnt chocolate while her companions complexion suggested that he was suffering from an advanced case of jaundice.Their huge dark eyes were sunk so deeply in their bulging, fat larded skulls that it was impossible to identify their exact color.Nostrils were wide and mouths reminded a couple of the prisoners of bottom dwelling fish.Advancing with a balletic waddle, they halted directly behind the security chief.When they spoke, the unexpectedly faint words seemed to come from somewhere deep within their massive, lumbering bodies.Why you try to enter Nerens?the man asked.The leader of the infiltration party strained to hear.What accent was that?Tongan, or perhaps Samoan?But there were too many clipped consonants, none of the softness in the brief query that would define Polynesian origins.Melanesian, perhaps, or even something localmeaning anywhere south of the Sahel.She responded without hesitation.The security chief had not put away his communicator.Not that it mattered whether she replied or not, she knew.She and her associates were dead anyway.It was the manner of dying she was bargaining.We were dropped off by floater and asked to perform a general reconnoiter and report back to Guangzhou.Report on what?inquired the corpulent female.Despite her similar size and shape her accent was completely different from that of her male companion.The bound woman shrugged as definitively as her bonds would permit.We were told to keep an eye out for unusual materials.Plastics, composites, especially metals.This response sparked a surprisingly animated conversation between the two blobs.Though the leader of the infiltrators strained to hear, the phrases being enunciated were too low and too garbled for her to glean more than an occasional word or two of the debate.When the overweight pair had concluded their discussion the man addressed the security chief.This time his speech was loud enough to be overheard.That is all.We are done here.Dispensation is yours, Mr.Kruger.The security chief nodded and the pair departed, barely managing to squeeze their respective bulks through the single portal.When the door had closed behind them Kruger turned back to the remaining captives.You heard the man.Dispensation is mine.Given your collective incompetence Im inclined to think youre relatively harmless.From the time your bumbling alerted the facilitys outer perimeter to your presence until the moment when you were rendered unconscious you were always under surveillance.You were only finally picked up because we got tired of monitoring you.To the prisoners credit a couple of them muttered a few choice sardonic comments.Im not going to waste time haranguing you.I have better things to do and more important demands on my time.You have cooperated, so youre going to be released.After all, youre only low level contract employees carrying out orders, and you didnt harm anyone while you were inside.He gestured toward the burned out human wick at the far end of the line.Youve paid a twenty five percent mortality penalty, chosen at random.We consider that warning enough.The captives could not have been more startled had Kruger suddenly morphed into a media star and announced that their present circumstances were a cleverly concocted sham and they were actually participants in a live reality vit.As he raised a hand to still their surprised murmuring, the groups leader eyed him coldly.We answered a couple of questions and now were free to go?Kruger gave an indifferent bob of his head.In a manner of speaking.Youll be taken well outside Nerenss security perimeter and set free.His tone hardened slightly.Without gear or clothing.Not even shoes.Ive been security chief at this station for a long time and I have confidence that the Namib will render the final judgment on your illegal intrusion.The other woman started to protest, only to be silenced by a sharp Shut up!from the groups leader.No one knew better than her what a tremendous break they had been given.She was careful not to smile.Were very grateful for the compassion.Speaking as a professional I know we dont deserve it.I for one certainly didnt expect it.Speaking as a professional, Kruger replied evenly, youre absolutely right.He raised the communicator.The prisoners tensed, but the commands the security chief uttered were directed to his staff and not at lethal apparatus.Entering the room through the single doorway a couple of security personnel commenced to free the prisoners limbs while others (too many others to try anything, the leader of the intruders knew) trained short range riot control weapons on the surviving trio.As Kruger had promised they were released, sans clothing, in an area of low dunes and gravel plains an indeterminate number of kilometers from the facility they had infiltrated.A light but thankfully warm breeze was blowing, uncertain whether to whoosh toward distant mountains or remain close to the nearby ocean.As their heavily armed escort trooped back into one of the two floaters that had carried them from the facility to this spot, the groups leader put her hands on her naked hips and took stock of their immediate surroundings.She did not speak until both transports had disappeared to the west.They think were going to die here.She spoke with a confidence born of extensive training.As if we need clothes or modern equipment to survive.Moving up alongside his commander, the big male Meld joined her in studying the southern horizon.Maybe theyre thinking that even if we do survive they can pick us up whenever they want.She nodded thoughtfully.Well have to keep well under cover.Fools.That Kruger: you could smell the arrogance drifting off him.He thought he had us cowed when he vaped Sulok.Probably hes used to frying poor stray prospectors and wandering animal poachers.He has no idea what were capable of.Well get out of this.She spoke through clenched teeth.And one of these days, in a restaurant or a pub or on a public transport, Ill make his acquaintance again.She regarded her companions.Were supposed to die out here.Well, the local animals dont, and if there are any Rousseauean natives, they dont either.None of them have our training or our survival skills.Lets get moving.She started southward, marking her heading by the sun.Keep an eye out for anything that looks useful; as food, weapon, or shelter.What about water?the other female Natural wondered.Dont worryI can smell water.What, you thirsty already?She jerked a thumb in the direction of now distant Nerens.If your mouths feeling dry why dont you head back toward the facility?Im sure theyll be happy to give you a drink.The other woman went silent.By evening they had managed to accumulate an impressive collection of found objects.Some bush berries proved bitter but edible and, more important, moist.Using their fingers and rough edged rocks the three of them were busy putting points on tough sticks to serve as spears.Clouds on the horizon held the promise of possible rain.Water carriers could be fashioned from suitable plant material.Oh, they would survive, all right.They would make it all the way south to the Orange River, avoid the town of Orangemund and any company agents waiting there, and work their way inland.All they needed was access to a single communicator and help would be forthcoming.Their employer would be disappointed, but not crushed.While their mission had been far from completely successful, neither was it a total failure.They had information to impart: details on Nerens security, memories of a portion of the internal layout, and a good deal more.A fire was easily built from scavenged dry sticks and the waxy branches of bushmens candle.Ancient human hunter gatherers had utilized the same survival techniques.Seated around the blaze and building it higher let them ward off the chill of the desert night.Yes, it was cold, but being dead was colder.Each of the trio was resourceful, well trained, tough.The Namib at night was chilling but it was not the Arctic.In letting them go, Nerenss overconfident security chief had seriously underestimated them.The group leader had closed her eyes and was resting her head on a small pile of dead brush when she heard the cough.At first she thought it was one of her comrades.Only when the deep, rough sound came again did she lift her head to blink into the darkness.Moon  and starlight showed her companions dozing peacefully beside the fading fire.Rising to her feet, she threw a few more twisted, wind scoured branches onto the blaze.Flames sprang higher and sought the sky.Embers danced briefly before flaming out.Turning a slow circle she sought the source of the sound that had disturbed her.She was not worried.If there was something out there it was probably only curious as to the nature of the intruders on its turf.If there was something out there that was more than curious, the substantial campfire would keep it at bay.The big Meld blinked sleepily and found her with his eyes.Whats on, Shu?Still studying the darkness beyond the glow from the fire the group leader shook her head.Not sure.Probably nothing.Thought I heard something.She stopped turning.Staring at her, the Meld started to sit up.Shu, what ?The eyes looking back at her did not blink.They were large and in the light from the fire yellow.Advancing with great deliberation, regal poise, and in complete silence, the male lion advanced toward her.Black of mane, he was at least three meters long and massed a couple of hundred kilos.Keeping her eyes fastened on the cat she knelt, reached behind her to grab one of the flaming branches from the fire, straightened, and thrust it forcefully in the lions direction.
