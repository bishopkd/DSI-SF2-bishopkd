Power to do what?He cant even conquer the Wolmen.But he is trying to weld them into one solid unit with his convicts.Dar smiled, amused.And just what do you think hell do with that unit?Build a very long ladder, and climb to Terra?He shook his head.Theres no way Shacklar can be a threat to anybody off this planetand the boys on Terra dont care what kind of threat he is to anybody on this planet.He tossed the plastic cube in the air and caught it, grinning.Not that I think you really are a spy.Of course, you could be a reporter, looking for a little bit of muck to rake, but why would you come all this way for it?To find something to report, Sam said with a vindictive smile.Nothing ever happens on Terra.Dar shrugged.Okaylets say you really are that hard up.What could you actually do?Turn in a ten minute report for a 3DT show about the horrible, crooked, scandalous doings out here on Wolmar?Sure.Youre far enough away to have a touch of the exotic.It might really catch on for a while.Were really bored on Terra.Dar shrugged.So wed be a six day wonder  Nine.Nine.And the Army would say, My Heavens!We didnt realize that was going on!And theyd send a formal, official notice to Shacklar that would say, You naughty, naughty boy!How dare you do all these horrible things!The way youre treating your convicts is criminal!And Shacklar, Im sure, would give them fifty excellent reasons, and finish by saying, But of course, since this isnt what you want, Ill be glad to do it your way.And Central HQ would say, Fine.You do it our way.Which they would go tell the media, and the media would tell it to the people in another show, and the people would sit back with that nice, solid feeling that theyd actually managed to accomplish something.And everybody would forget about it.And Shacklar wouldnt actually do anything?Oh, surehed give me a week of chores for shooting off my mouth.Which is okay; its restful to do something that doesnt involve any responsibility, now and then.Sam sighed.All right.Then you should just tell me about those laser parts because you want toand because theres no good reason not to Is there?None, except my firm conviction that youll put the worst possible construction on anything I tell you.What about those laser parts?Theyre military issue, arent they?Sure.What else would a general be able to get, that natives would want?That doesnt strike you as a little bit corrupt?Why?Theyre being used for a military purpose.The Wolmens military purpose!Sam exploded.Its gunrunning!I suppose you could call it that, Dar said judiciously.Suppose!Dont you realize youre signing your own death warrants?Not as long as things stay peaceful, Dar pointed out.Shacklar has more faith in trade than in firepower.Its awfully hard to fight your own customers.But not exactly unknown.True, Dar agreed.Thats why its so important to get the two groups to understand each other, and do some socializing.You might fight your customer, but you wont fight your friendif we can get them to be friends.If a real war does start, and if all the Wolman tribes ever unite against us, were dead.They outnumber us a thousand to one.Blasters would just speed up the process, thats all.Then why not sell them blasters?Sam demanded.Why just spare parts?Well, for one thing, whole blasters are a little difficult to get the Army to ship to a prison planet.Dar pressed a button in the side of the plastic cube; it started to hum.But spare parts theyll ship us by the thousands.Sam shook her head.The insanities of bureaucracy!She watched the humming cube begin to unfold and expand.And for another thing?For another thing, if we just sell them parts and instruction manuals, they have to learn how to put the dern things together.Dar smiled, a faraway look in his eyes.And that makes em begin to wonder how and why it worksso they end up learning technology.Waitll they find out what a headache that lathes going to be!Just to get it working, theyll have to learn so much!Something of a sadist, arent you?It goes with being a teacher.Dar watched the plastic cube finish swelling into a slant roofed shack, ten feet on a side.Bout time to turn in for the night.Sam shook her head, looking frazzled.If Id known it was like this   Hey, I never promised you a grav bed or synthsilk sheets!No, no!I mean this whole planet!The structure your Generals built up!The things hes trying to do!If Id known it was like this, I wouldve personally put a bomb on that new governors ship!Dar froze halfway through the door.Then he looked back over his shoulder.Excuse mewhat was that again?The new governor.Sam frowned.You knowthe one thats supposed to arrive tomorrow.Dar uncoiled back out of the door and straightened up.No, as it happens, I didnt know.And neither does anyone else on Wolmar.They didnt tell you?Sam looked startled.Well  anyway, theyre doing it.BOAs sending out a new governor, with power to ship Shacklar home and take over all his authority.Theyre kind of unhappy that the Wolman Question is taking so long to resolve.Oh, they are?Dar breathed.How interesting.Howd you come by this fascinating little tidbit?Common knowledge back on Terra?Well, I wouldnt exactly call it headline news  Were not quite that important, Dar agreed dryly.It was the last piece of paper to cross my desk the day I quitarranging transportation for this man Bhelabher and his aides.Bhelabher, mm?Whats he like?Oh  Sam shrugged.You knownothing exceptional.A career civil servant, thats all.Quite, Dar agreed.Stodgy, you might say?Stuffy, Sam confirmed.Very conservativeespecially about military procedure and the treatment of convicts What are you doing?Packing up.Dar punched a button and watched the shack start folding itself back into a cube.Were getting back to town.I said something?You didand youve got to say it again, as soon as possible.To Shacklar.Weve got to make sure he knows whats coming.3  Whatever you do, dont let him know whats coming, Cholly advised.But hes gotta get ready!Dar protested.Repel boarders!Fire when he sees the gleam of their spaceship!Damn the triplicates, full speed ahead!Over the top!Under the counter, Cholly corrected.Whatever happens, hes got to be able to truthfully say he doesnt know anything about it.Oh.Dar caught the inside of his cheek between his teeth.I forgot about that.Dont.Cholly began polishing the bar again.A clean conscience and a clean record, lad.First rule in political lying, Dar explained to Sam.Dont.Be able to claim somebody misunderstood youor did it on their own.Well have to do it on our own, for this one, Cholly amended.The Generals a horrible liar.Cant even claim he was misunderstood.Dar nodded resolutely.Right.How about a quick commando raid?Illegal, Cholly pointed out.You dont think you can get rid of Bhelabher legally!Sam exclaimed.Nay, but we can do it in a way that cant be proven illegal.He means weve gotta be able to claim it was an accident, Dar explained.Great.Sams lips thinned.Excuse me, sir, I didnt mean to slip that strychnine in your martini.Oh heavens, my bomb!I dropped it!Effective, but impractical, Cholly said judiciously.Very hard to ignore.But youve got to do something!Think of the good of the planet!I do, Cholly said thoughtfully, and personally, what Id say this planet needs is a good customs office.Real Scotch whiskey, mind, the sergeant reminded.Dar nodded.Straight from Terra itselfNova Scotia Regal.Two liters each, for you and your corporal.Fair enough!The sergeant shouldered his laser rifle and came to attention.Well stand guard day in and day out, matefor all day tomorrow, that is.Though why youd want to guard this old shack is beyond my understandin.Aint been nothin in there but spare parts an waste for ten years.There is now.Dar peeled off the backing and reached up to press the new sign into place over the doorway of the battered geodesic.A carpet, five chairs, two ashtrays, and a counter.Customs Office?The corporal squinted up at the sign.Is this official?Thoroughly, Dar assured him.Believe me, I knowI wrote up the orders myself.Shacklar ordered it, hm?You cant expect him to keep track of every little thing.The sergeant let out a throttled moan and stiffened, reddening.Dar looked up at him, frowning, then followed the direction of his gazeto see Sam coming up to him, dressed in a tight fitting blue uniform with gold epaulets and a visored beret.Dar stiffened, toohe hadnt been sure she had a figure.Cholly looked up his billings and found a Wolman whod ordered a sewing machine.She handed Dar a flat, neatly tied package, oblivious to their stares.His wife was willing to do a rush job.Dar shook himself.Uh, great.Whatd it cost him?Four power packs, six blaster barrels, two circuit chips, and a bathtub.Worth every credit, the sergeant wheezed, his eyes locked on her.Better get to it.Sam turned to the door.Ive got to set up the terminal and the paperwork.Uhright.Dar tore his eyes away from her and glanced at his watch ring.How much time do we have?Cholly says the ferrys due to take off from your moon at thirteen oclock, Sam said from inside the shack.What time is it?Thirteen oclock.Dar started stripping.Here then, Dar Mandra!Dar looked up, irritated, then snatched at his uniform; it wasnt good policy for a Wolman to see soldiers naked, and the man coming up with Cholly was the shaman of the Sars tribe.Peace, Dar Mandra.The shaman held up a hand.Uh, peace, Reverend.Dar scrambled into his uniform, sealed the tunic, and held up a palm.Honored to see you, but, uhwhyre you wearing a Customs uniform?Why, hes one of yer staff now, aincha, Reverend?Cholly grinned.Just to cover all bets, Dar.Ye e e e ah.Dars eyes slowly widened.Your hunches might come in handy, Reverend.Officer Haldane, for the time being, Dar Mandra.The shaman wrung Dars hand a bit awkwardly; he wasnt used to the custom.You understand, I cannot guarantee to know the speaking of their minds.Yes, yes, I know the Power sends the gift when It wishes, not when we do.Dar clasped his hands behind his back and massaged his knuckles.But I hope Itll be with us today, Rever  uh, Officer Haldane.I, too, the shaman said somberly.Shacklar must remain with us, Dar Mandra.I have no wish to see my young men die leaning on laser beamsnor yours, either.Definitely not.Dar was suddenly very conscious of his age.And I think you had best arrange matters so I need not speak.Oh, Im sure that wont be necessary, Reverend, Dar said quickly.You speak better Terran than I do.It is kind of youbut I do have something of an accent.Lessn mine, Cholly said.Still, the Rev has the right of it, ladthere might be an aide who knows something of Wolman.And though I have washed off my dye for the occasion, my nation is written in my face, for him who knows how to see it.The shaman stilled suddenly, then peered upward.The Power favors me this day, Dar Mandra.Your enemies approach.Dar squinted up at the sky, but couldnt detect the faintest glimmer of flame.Still  Your words good enough for me, Reverend.Shall we go look official?The ferry roared down, blackening the blast pit anew.Dar watched through the window as the ramp slid out and the hatch lifted.He saw the party troop out and stop in consternation at the sight of the shack.The guards glanced at each other and stepped forward; the sergeant went up to the group, holding his rifle at port arms, and had a few words with a fox faced man in the front row.Another man elbowed his way to the fore to interrupt their conversation.He wasnt tall exactly, but he gave the impression of towering height; and he was skinny, but he had a massive presence.The longer his conversation with the sergeant went on, the more clearly Dar could hear his voice; but the sergeant remained firm and apparently soft voiced; he just waited for a blast to blow itself out, then said a few words and leaned into the next blast.But Dar did begin to notice his rifle barrel twitching.Mentally, Dar upped the sergeant two pints of Scotch and a fifth of bourbon.Finally, the skinny man threw his head up in exasperation and started for the shack.His entourage swept along behind him, and the sergeant followed, poker faced.Get ready, Dar said softly, customers.The door slammed open, and the skinny man waded in.Who is responsible for this farce?Im the senior official present, sir.Dar kept his face carefully neutral.May I be of service?Service!You can serve me admirably by dismissing this piece of asininity and conveying us immediately to your Government House!Certainly, siras soon as weve cleared you through Customs.Customs!This planet has never had a Customs Office!Ive read all the reports!An innovation, Dar said truthfully.Were constantly trying to improve conditions, sir.The rest of the entourage had trooped in; the corporal shut the door behind them.He and the sergeant discreetly took up places at the corners of the room.Honorable Bhelabher  The fox faced man appeared at the skinny mans elbow.it may be that these good people are unaware of your official status.He gave Dar a glare of such intense malice that Dar felt his blood temperature drop.Out of the corner of his eye, he noticed Reverend Haldane wince just the tiniest bit.Well taken, Canis, well taken, Bhelabher harrumphed.He turned back to Dar.See here, fellowdo you know who I am?Not really, sirbut I would like to find out.May I see your passport, please?Dar decided Sam mightve had the right idea after all: strychnine.Fellow, indeed!Passport!Bhelabher bellowed.Young man, Ill have you know Im your new governor!Dar paused and widened his eyes just a trifle; then he leaned forward, holding out his hand.An interesting theory, Honorable; Ill have to validate it with Government House.Im afraid I havent heard anything about Governor Shacklar being replaced, though.May I see your passport, please?Absurd!On a planet full of convicts, certainly I should be above suspicion!But because this is a convict planet, no one can be above suspicion, Dar said smoothly.Im afraid I must insist on seeing your credentials, Honorable.Bhelabher began to redden, making choking, gargling sounds; but the fox faced man put a hand on his arm, and he subsided just short of magenta.Very well, if you must!Bhelabher growled.Atavista, our credentials, please.A skinny young woman stepped up to open a folder and lay a set of microholos on the counter.Her clothing was skintight and transparent which, given her figure, wasnt exactly an advantage; but Dar found he had to focus very tightly on her face anyway.That definitely did the trick.Sam took the microholos and began feeding them through the terminal.Dar noticed that the bottom wafer was a plastyrus envelope with Shacklars name on it.Reverend Haldane stepped up next to Dar, collecting the wafers as Sam handed them back.He glanced at the fox faced man and murmured, so softly that Dar could scarcely hear him, Each person has copies of all those documents in his luggage.Dar carefully didnt let anything show in his face, but he pressed his hand flat against the counter to show hed heard.He also noticed that the plastyrus envelope didnt come back to the stack.Sam finished and turned to murmur something to the Reverend.He turned to Dar and murmured, Officer Bine says the documents bear a lock code and will not read through our Central.Nice, Dar thought.Hed wondered how he was going to justify it.Sam seemed more interesting than ever.Im afraid well have to retain your documents, Honorable.What?Dar glanced up to make sure the roof was still on the shack, then back to Bhelabher.Im afraid well have to retain your credentials.You see, they seem to be locked under a security code which hasnt been transmitted to our computer.This is outrageous!Bhelabher stormed.Of all the inconceivable idiocies Ive encountered, this has to be the most imbecilic!Young man, I will not tolerate this!Im afraid we have no choice, Dar said regretfully.And, under the circumstances, Im afraid it will be necessary to search every item of your partys luggage.Bhelabher began reddening and gargling again, and the fox faced mans glare narrowed to an ice pick.I appreciate that you may find this unacceptable, Dar sympathized.If so, the shuttle isnt quite done refueling yet; Im sure the pilot will be glad to take you back.Bhelabher clamped his jaw shut, his eyes bulged, and the room was very silent for a few seconds.Then he released a huge hiss of breath and snapped, Very well.Well begin with mine.Canis, the bags, please.Canis glanced at him, frowning, but stepped forward and hoisted two valises onto the counter.Dar opened them and passed them to Sam and the Reverend, who each began shuffling through the stacks of paper thin garments in a half of each bag.Dar couldnt detect anything being removed but, when Sam closed the bag, set it upright on the counter, and turned to nod to Dar, there was a very meaningful look in her eye.Dar made a mental note that she was a sleight of hand artist, too, and never to play poker with her; but he also started making very definite plans to start playing some other game with her as soon as he could maneuver her into it.He opened the next suitcase and passed it on.They were quick, she and the Reverend; but there were a lot of bags, and the time stretched out.The aides began to mutter and grumble to one another, but Bhelabher stood rock still, legs apart, hands clasped in front of him; and Canis stood like a malevolent statue at his sideor a ventriloquists mannequin, Dar thought.He wondered which one was really doing the talking.Finally Sam closed the last case and gave him the nod.Dar turned to Bhelabher with a smile.All done, Honorable.Thank you, Bhelabher said sourly.I assume we now have the freedom of the planet?UhIm sorry, Honorable.Dar looked up in surprise.I thought Id made that clear.Clear?How so?There was an ominous rumble under Bhelabhers voice.Your credentials, Dar explained.We cant admit you officially until theyve been verified with Government House.We should have them back to you in twenty four hours, though.Twenty four hours!If General Shacklar has the lock code for your documents.Longer, if he doesnt.But Im sure he will.There was a moments silence while Bhelabhers face puffed up and passed magenta.Dar braced himself.Then the Honorable erupted.Dar leaned into the blast and listened closely; he was always out to improve his vocabulary.He wasnt sure what half the words meant; but he did get the impression that:  1) the Honorable was somewhat distressed by this turn of events;  2) the delay was totally unacceptable;  3) there was obviously a conspiracy afoot to prevent his assuming his rightful post; and that  4) he thought Dars hide would make an excellent ornament for his new office, nailed to the wall and tastefully decorated with a carefully balanced pattern of intersecting whip welts.When Bhelabher ran down, Dar glanced at Sam, who whipped out a pad and jotted down a few lines.Your protest is noted, Dar said with a small, polite smile, but Im afraid thats all we can do about it.Regulations are regulations, Honorable.Im sure you understand.Bhelabher took a breath, but the sergeant cleared his throat rather loudly and transferred his blaster rifle from his left shoulder to his right.Bhelabher paused in mid gasp, glanced at the soldier out of the corner of his eye, then slowly closed his mouth and turned back to Dar.Of course.Quite.I trust you have accommodations for myself and my staff while we endure this outrage?Not here at the port, Dar admitted.But there are some transient facilities in town.The sergeant will show you the routeand stay nearby, in case you should need anything.Solely for our convenience, Bhelabher said dryly.Surely.He turned to survey his staff.Well  there seems to be no help for it.I see now how badly this poor, benighted colony needs our ministrations, good people.However, until we have an opportunity to streamline this laughable attempt at a bureaucracy, Im afraid well have to endure some inconvenience.Please be patient.He started toward the door.The corporal stepped over and opened it for him.Bhelabher paused in the doorway to look back at Dar.You havent heard the last of me, young manbe sure of it.But you have heard the last of us, Dar said as the door closed behind the last aide, and your credentials.Right here.Sam started piling wafers on the countertop.Youre really good at that, y know?Dar yanked off his beret.I didnt know BOA trained pickpockets.Just a difference in emphasis, Sam said.Besides, I wouldnt have known what to do without the Reverend.He knew right where to look in each bag.Yeahthanks, Reverend.Dar started peeling out of his tunic.We couldnt have brought it off without you.The Power favored me, Haldane said modestly.I wish you luck, Dar Mandra.This will be, at most, an inconvenience to him.Well, Im hoping for morebut youre right; its only a delaying tactic.And he might not be delayed very long in getting Shacklar out here.He pulled on his coverall and turned to Sam.Better change.Weve gotta get out of here, fast.4  The glass chattered on the table, and Dar looked up.I could swear I heard a dull boom.Ayuh.Cholly tilted his head to the side.Id almost think I had, too.Queer; aint it?Right on the borderline between hearing and feeling.Sam turned to Dar Either it was very soft, or very far away.Soldiers dont go in for target practice much.Dar turned to Cholly.Anybody sell some Wolmen a cannon?Only the partsand they havent got the button yet.Mustve been a natural phenomenon.Dar tossed back the rest of his beer and set the glass down.How long do you think itll take em to realize we, ah, confiscated all the copies of their credentials?About as long as it takes them to find a hotel roomand I expect yer friend the sergeantll lead em the long way round the barn.If I know him, hell take em by way of the back pasturewhich is where Bhelabher belongs, anyway.The mans got all the tact of a barbell.Dar turned to Sam.Howd a blusterer like that get promoted to governor, anyway?They couldnt fire him, she explained.He had too much seniority.So they had to kick him up to where he couldnt do any harmto his bosses, anyway.No harm?What was he beforehand, a general?Chief filing clerk.Sam shrugged.Sorry, Dar, but thats the way they see it.Gossip said hed caused three rebellions by putting the right document in the wrong place.Perfect.Dar held out his glass for a refill.Not even as important as a pile of molecudots.To them, you are a molecudot.The door bonged, and a man in a very ornate jumpsuit came in, grinning from ear to ear.Youre off early today, Corve.Cholly reached for a bottle and glass.Bit of a frumus today.Corve adjusted himself to a barstool and accepted the glass.Boss decided to give everybody the day off and let the new guests shift fer themselves.That flock of civvies?Dar managed mild interest.Where they in from, anyway?Terra, seems.Corve took a gulp or two.Their boss claims hes the new governor.New governor?Dar frowned.What for?Weve got Shacklar!And wed best find a way to keep him, from the looks of this one.Now, Corve, thats not fer you to say, Cholly reproved him.You just holds the door at the hotel.Ayuh, but Im not on duty now.Corve turned to Dar.Its names Bhelabher, an its brains in its mouth.Just what we need to consolidate Wolman relations, Dar said dryly.Is he the new gov?Dunno; he cant find his papers.Corve grinned wolfishly.Hadnt but scarcely found his rooms when he let out a roar like a ship trying to land without jets; I swear he shook the whole hotel.Dar looked up at Cholly.Kind of an explosion, huh?Or a cannon?The chemical kind, I mean.Heard him all the way down here, eh?Well, cant say as Im surprised.I thought of luggage bombs, myself.But no, he came storming back into the lobby with his whole flock at his heels.Theres thieves in this hotel!he cries.Theyve rifled all our luggage!Well, I dont doubt the boss was thinking of rifling himbut no, he kept his face polite, and says, There are no guests in this hotel today but you and yours; and as for me and mine, why, I stayed here at the desk, the maids having her batteries charged, and the staffs there by the door, ready to hold it for you.Well, Bhelabher, he started up some deal of nonsense about how dumb it is to have a hotel with so small a staff to blame things on, but his top aide  face kinda like a rat   Fox, Dar murmured.an heuh  say again?He coughed.Sam kicked Dar in the ankle.Please go on, sir.Yeah, well, the rat faced one, he says, Those people at the Customs Office, Honorable  And Honorable, he hits his forehead with the heel of his handmust do that a lot, I notice hes a little flat headedand says, How obvious!No wonder I overlooked it!Why, of course thered be corruptionriddled with it!Bureaucratic piracy, without a doubt!And he starts for the door, thundering, But how could they have known where to find the documents?And the rat faced one, he says, Read our minds, no doubt, and all the rest of them, they set to wailing about how unfair it was, to have mind readers all about, and hows a decent bureaucrat going to make a living if all his little secrets are known, and what evil people mind readers are.And Honorable, he says, We must see the General immediately, and have those Customs people questioned, and I pulled the door and they swirled on out, Bhelabher and his whole covey right behind him.And I closed the door and like to fell over, laughing so hard I thought Id shake myself apart.No wonder.Dar managed to chuckle himself.Customs office?On a prison planet?And mind readers!Hoo!Corve chortled.Such a deal of nonsense!And thesere educated?Wull, knowing facts cant cure stupidity, Cholly mused, and Shacklars anything but stupid.Id love to see what happens when they find him.The door bonged, and a private stepped in, chuckling.I think were about to find out.Dar turned to the new arrival.Something go right, Cosca?All depends on which end you were on.Cosca pulled himself up to a barstool.Me, I was on the outside, listening in.Dont executives anywhere know better than to leave their intercoms open?Sam demanded.Just the other way around, Dar corrected.Sometimes they know better than to turn them off.What wasnt private, Cosca?A complaint, chiefly.Cosca accepted his beet Or maybe a challenge.I can guess the chief who made the complaint, Corve grinned.Who made the challenge?Same as the complainerthis Terran bigwig, Beelubber   Bhelabher, Dar and Corve both corrected.Whos telling this story, anyway?All right, Bhelabher.Honorable high huckster from Terrahe says.He comes sailing in without so much as a by your leave, roars, Wheres the governor?and goes slamming into Shacklars office afore a one of us could say a word.Matter of fact, we couldnt even hear ourselves, his gang was making so much noise, chattering about how telepaths was undermining the foundations of society  Telepaths?Dar frowned.Mind readers, Corve explained.Gotta hand it to emthey keep to a line of thought.Howd the General take it, Cosca?Well, he was in conference at the time  With his cat o nine tails, or a patient?Patient.As long as we can keep the troubled ones coming, it keeps him away from the cat.Analysis, it waswith Rogoure.Rogoure?Dar stiffened.Isnt he that private who almost chopped a Wolman in Mondays battle?The same.An you know how Shacklar ishe wouldnt ask the man to leave his knife outside.Well, Id guess that Rogoures paranoid.Dar started to grin.And they were deep into his childhood when Bhelabher charged in?Cholly guessed.Id saybut all I know is, Rogoure bellows, Theyve come to get me!and jumps up with that knife out  Good reflexes, Dar noted.Corve nodded.Hed make a top notch soldier.Well!I dont need to tell you.It got somewhat furry for a while there.Meaning Bhelabher was screaming, and Rogoure was shouting war cries, and Shacklar was trying to bellow them both into order?Something of the sort.Well, the General, he did manage to get Rogoure calmed down, and apologized for the interruption.But you know how it is, he says, when ones involved in government.Any Johnny in the street thinks hes got the right to bust in to see you at all odd hours of the day and night.Well, I can comp that, Rogoure, he answers.Id likely do the same if I felt I really had a gripe.Hed made progress already, that one.I hope you will, says Shacklar.Take it out on me, not on the Wolmen.Will you, Private?My word upon it, sir, says Rogoure.Next time Im feeling homicidal, Ill come for you.Good chap!says Shacklar.But if you do stay calm, Ill see you at this time tomorrow?That you will, sir.And Rogoure, he salutes.Well enough, says Shacklar, saluting back.Dismissed!And Rogoure clicks his heels, about faces on the mark, and marches out.And this time last week, you couldntve gotten him to come to parade rest.Dar shook his head.Shacklars amazing.Bhelabher didnt think so.Rogoure was barely out before the Honorable pulled himself together enough to bellow, What is this placea lions den?So it would seem, says Shacklar, when the folk who come dont even have the manners of a flea.I thought civilians still abided by the old quaint custom of requesting admittance when the door was closed.Even Sam smiled.He sounds a little miffed.Oh, his tone was fresh dry ice!Thats a rather poor reception, Bhelabher says, for the new governor of this planet.Well.I tell you, Shacklar all but froze.I should think the news wouldve come as a bit of a shock, yes.Oh, the Generals used to delusions of grandeur.You could almost see it going through his mind.I understand a cargo ship came down today, he says.Bhelabher nods.Myself was on it, and my whole staff.Well, if you knew the General, you could see he didnt think that ruled out aberrations.Youve come from Terra?We have, says Bhelabher, sent out by the BOA to take charge of this planet and rid it of corruption and of vice.Shacklar, he sat down at his desk and made a note or two.I assume you have got credentials to support your claim?I had, Bhelabher says, like it was an accusation, but the officials at your Customs Office confiscated not only the originals, but all the copies, too.Corve chuckled.Cosca nodded.I expect Shacklar thought so, toobut he didnt show it, of course.Bhelabher bellows, You must find those scoundrels!And Shacklar answers, It would be rather surprising if we could.In fact, its amazing that you managed to find our Customs Office, since we dont have one!Come, sir, Bhelabher says.Surely you at least know the departments of your own administration.I do, says Shacklar, and I tell you, theres no Customs Office.Where did you find it, by the way?Right at the spaceport, says Bhelabher.A small plastrete structure, about twenty feet square.One of the storage sheds, Shacklar says, nodding.What did it have by way of personnel?Two men and a woman, answers Bhelabher.Surely you know of them!Im afraid not, says Shacklar, though it shouldnt be too difficult discovering who the woman was; therere only about seventy of them in the settlement.Well, then you could begin to hear it in Bhelabhers voice; hed begun to figure it out for himself.Do you imply that these personnel were not official?Not really, says Shacklar.Im sure they appointed themselves properly before they took office.Well, Bhelabher was quiet then, but his face turned a very interesting color  Mauve, Dar supplied.Magenta, Corve corrected.Closer to maroon, Id say.Then he explodes: I have been deceived!I believe conned is the old term, Shacklar agreed.Certainly someone has played on your gullibility.Bhelabher rumbles, I dont quite think  Quite, says Shacklar.At any rate, this puts us both in a rather delicate position, Honorable.Bhelabher says slowly, Yes, I can understand that, which I, for one, found surprising.Your claims may be quite legitimate, Shacklar goes on.BOA may have sent you out here to assume the administration of this colony.Indeed they have!snaps Bhelabher.But you have no credentials to verify that statement, Shacklar points out.I have witnesses!Bhelabher huffs.My whole staff will testify in support of this robbery!Im sure they will, Shacklar says, and his voice was vermouth.But youll pardon me, Honorable, if I can not quite accept their testimony as totally impartial.Bhelabher says nothing, and Shacklar gets gentle.Im sure you must see that I cannot cede administration of this colony to you merely on your say so.But this is intolerable!Bhelabher cries.My appointment is totally legitimate!which was more than I could say for himself.As well it may be, says Shacklar, getting hard again, but it could also be a scheme of deception on a very large scale.Sir, Bhelabher rumbles, do I understand you to say that I am a confidence swindler?You do not, Shacklar answers, but since you wish to say it, you may.Certainly I must assume as much, since you lack proof of your claim.But this is intolerable, Bhelabher explodes again, Especially since it is far more likely that you, sir, are the schemer!You have absolute control of this settlement; how could a few of its inhabitants mount such a ruse without your consent, nay, your command?Is it not logical that you would so seek to maintain your own Well, sirs and madam, thats just about when the General turned round and slammed the door, and we had to content ourselves with what we could hear through the wall.Which was?Corve demanded.Oh, a deal of shouting and bellowing, and the odd low mutter from Shacklar, but nothing you could make out in words.It slackened, though, got softer and softer, till we couldnt hear nothing at all.And thats just about when we thought to see if the Generald maybe been careless with his intercom again.You just checked it, of course.Of course; I doubt that we listened for a full thirty seconds.Dar coughed delicately.We, uh, certainly wouldnt want you to violate a confidence or anything, but   No fear.Not much we could violate, anyway; bout all we heard was, when we pressed the button, the Honorable saying,  started when I was four.Thats when my mother became involved with the amateur holovision programming club, you see, and of course it demanded a great deal of time.Our district child care center was very nice, really, but most of the children were older than I was, and looking back on it, I see that they all must have been rather disturbed Shacklar murmured something sympathetic, but thats just about when the rat faced aide noticed us and started saying something about telepaths eavesdropping couldnt be avoided, but  Well, we decided the intercom was working, and switched it off.The ethical thing to do, Dar agreed.How long ago was that?Cosca glanced at his ring.Bout half an hour.Id expect that by this time hes into the traumas of grade school.Ever Shacklars way, Cholly grinned.If you cant beat em, analyze em.What were his henchmen doing, Cosca?Oh, the usualsitting around waiting, and bothering us for coffee, and wondering how the psi whod swiped their credentials had known they was comin.I mean, hedve had to, wouldnt he, tove been able to set up a fake Customs Office in time to catch em comin off the ferry?Makes sense, Dar said judiciously.Did they?Not a bit.Cosca shook his head.The rat faced one, he said this proved there must be a conspiracy of psis, all the way from Terra to here, cause that was the only way word couldve come out faster than an FTL starship could carry itat the speed of thought, which he claimed to be faster than the speed of light  Ridiculous, Sam snorted.Isnt it just?Theres nothing so unbeatable as wanting to stay ignorant.But even Ratty wasnt about to believe one single telepath could hear thoughts on Terra from all the way out here on Wolmar; so, he claimed, there mustve been a network of psis, each one relayin the message, till a telepath here picked it up and set up a reception for em.He didnt quite say Shacklar was a part of the conspiracy, and a telepath, too, but   But thats when you decided youd best take a beer break and cool off under the collar, hey?Cholly guessed.Cosca nodded.Got my perspective back on the way over, though, and got to seeing the humorous side of it.Well!Im recovered, and Id best get back to the office.And let one of your mates come out and cool off?Cosca nodded.And hope theres no mayhem been done while Ive been gone.Well!Ta, chaps!He headed for the door.And to yerself, Cosca.Cholly waved.Corve, would you mind the store for a bit?Dar and Sam and me got to talk over their list for the next trading trek.Eh?Eh, surely now, Cholly!Corve heaved himself up, ambled round behind the bar, and began whistling through his teeth as he poured himself another mugful.Dar looked up at Cholly, already halfway to the back room, and frowned.Then he nodded to Sam and followed.Whats this all about?she muttered as she caught up with him.Dont know, Dar answered softly, but somethings gone wrong.I wasnt supposed to go trading so soon.They stepped into the back room, and Sam stared.Books.All around.Ceiling to floor, and the ceiling was high.Books bound, micro books, molecue books, holotapes, and readers for everything.Even some antique paper books.Just your average hole in the wall tavern, Dar said cheerfully.Whats up, boss?Sit down, lad, sit down.Cholly pulled a large box from a drawer and set it on the table.Dar sat down, looking wary.The problem is, Cholly said, shaking out a large white cloth and fastening it around Dars neck, that the Generals likely to give the Honorable and his troop the freedom of the planet.Dar blanched.I hadnt thought of that.No, nor did I.  Understandable lack, Im sure, in view of the rush we were under; still, there it is.So you twove got choices: to hole up till it all blows over, or to go in disguise while theyre here.We cant be so well disguised that they wont recognize us, Sam blurted.Cholly held up a hand.Have faith.I had occasion, one time, to travel with a group of wandering actors   The cops were after him, Dar explained.Be that as it may, be that as it may.Cholly took some putty out of a can and started kneading it.Took a small part now and again, myself, and didnt do badly, if I do say so Well.The long and the short of it is, I became reasonably good with theatrical makeup, and accumulated a trunkful.Which we are now about to get the benefit of, Dar interpreted.Close yer mouth, now; you dont need no prosthesis on yer tongue.Cholly pressed the lump of putty to Dars nose and began shaping it into a startlingly natural hook.Robex, this isbest way of changing the shape of the face that the theater ever came up with.Beautiful, tisjust knead it till it gets soft, set it on cartilage, shape it, and itll adhere as tight as yer natural born skin.How do I get it off?Dar muttered.With the solventand it tastes terrible, so close yer great gape of a mouth.Then it dries as hard as cartilage, this being Robex # 1.Its changing color, Sam pointed out.Cholly nodded.Thats part of the beauty of it, dont yer seeit starts out pasty gray, but takes on the color of the flesh its on.Now, back in the old days, youdve had to choose the premixed sort of base that came closest to yer natural skin tone and paste it on all over yer fleshyou wouldve had Dark Egyptian, lad.But with Robex, you see, all you do is blend it into yer skin, and it does the rest.No need for base.Thats great for cartilage.But if it hardens that way, wont it be just a teeny bit obvious if I use it to shape my cheeks?Oh, we use Robex # 2 for thatdries to the consistency of whatever flesh its on.Cholly opened another can and scooped out a lump of dough.Yer own motherll never know ye when Im done with you, lad.My own mother, Dar mumbled, never wanted to know me at all.About an hour later, the door opened, and Corve stuck his head in.Uh, Cholly, I believe as how ya might want to be out here.Do I indeed, do I indeed!Cholly whisked the cloth off Sam and over his makeup chest.Ayuh, Corve, certainly.Whos the strangers, Cholly?Corve frowned dubiously.Why, this heres Enib Mas, Corve.Cholly gave Sam a pat on the head, incidentally setting the roots of her wig into the adhesive.And that theres Ardnam Rod.Just in off the freighter.Turns out Enibs had a year of college, and Ards had two, so I thought theyd like a look back here.Oh!Welcome, welcome!Corve bustled in, holding out a hand.What ya up for?Rather not say, Dar rumbled in his deepest voice.He pumped Corves hand.Pleased to meet you.Me, too, Sam said in a high, nasal tone.Do you ever get used to this place?Quick enough, quick enough.Corve shook her hand.You dont look too well, ladbut dont worry, Wolmarll put meat on yer bones.Well!Afraid I gotta be off, Chollyif I know the boss, hellve got over his miff, and be open for business again.Best to be sure, best to be sure.Cholly took Corve by the arm and guided him out.See you this evening, Corve.That ya will, that ya will.Heres yer company, Cholly.Good day to you.And Corve headed out the door, leaving Cholly to face General Shacklar and Bhelabher.Had him totally fooled, didnt we?Sam murmured.Not for a second, Dar muttered back.Why do you think he was so over polite?And didnt ask where Dar and Sam were?Sam said nothing, but her eyes were wide.nothing exceptional to look at, Shacklar was saying as Cholly bustled over behind the bar, but the drinks as good as you can get out here, and the foods excellent.Most importantly, though, this is really our community center.Groups meet here to discuss anything and everything, to socialize, and to work out personal problems into a sympathetic ear.Hello, Sympathetic Ear!Bhelabher reached out a tentative hand and smiled at Cholly with genuine, if confused, warmth.Cholly accepted the hand as Shacklar murmured, The Honorable Vincent Bhelabher; of the Bureau of Otherworldly Activities.Pleased, Cholly affirmed, with an eye on the General.Dar choked in his beer.Yes Bhelabher murmured.The General had mentioned something about your commercial enterprise He seemed rather bemused.Enterprising it is, enterprising it is.Cholly nodded.Though lately, its not been too commercial  Well, Im, sure therere slack periods in any line of commerce.But the General seems to feel that this particular line of exchange offers his only real hope of any lasting peace with the natives.The Generals too kind, Cholly demurred.Has he told you of his war games?Only a stopgap, Charles, Shacklar murmured.I was speaking of hopes for a permanent peace, which must be founded on mutual understanding.Im sure, Im sure.Bhelabher nodded genially.Still, Id like to witness one of these, ah, games.As indeed you shall.I regret that I wont be able to conduct you, myself, due to the press of business; will you excuse me, Honorable?Eh?Yes, of course, of course!Bhelabher seized Shacklars hand and pumped it.No need even to explain, of course, old chap; Ive had responsibility for major administrative sectors myself.Of course I understand!I hoped you would.Shacklars smile seemed real.Charles, I trust youll be able to spare the Honorable your best trader for a guide during his stay here.Oh, of course!With a wicked grin, Cholly slapped Dar on the back.None but the best.General!Ard here, hes yer man!This time Dar managed to at least get the beer down the right pipe, and lifted his head to give Cholly his best gimlet glare.But Cholly just kept grinning, as though he hadnt a care in the world, which he hadnt.Ard will see you get a thorough look at our piece of this planet, and a good bit of whats outside the wall then, Shacklar said.In the meantime, please be assured well do all we can to recover your credentials.Not unless theyre awfully good at reconstructing ashes, Dar murmured to Sam.She kicked him.I very much appreciate it, Bhelabher said earnestly.For my part, Ive seen to it that the shuttle pilot carried back a note to BOA, an official dispatch, of course.And the liner should be bound back inward in a week.Shacklar nodded.But Im afraid Ill have to ask your indulgence there.Honorableafter all, it is a two month journey to Terra.Oh, I quite understand!But if all goes well, we should receive a reply in half a year, Standard Terran.Still, I have hopes well recover our credentials before then.Im sure well manage to conclude the manner in some fashion, Shacklar assured him.Something beeped at his hand, and his brow netted.Cant they get by without me for a short hour?Yes, Fordstam, what is it?he murmured into his ring, then held it to his ear.After a moment, he sighed and spoke into it again.Yes, yes, Im on my way Youll excuse me, Honorable, but it seems one of my soldiers has been making decent proposals to a Wolman girl, and the tribes mayors concerned.Indecent proposals theyre used to, but they dont know quite what to make of this one.Well  Im sure it had to happen sooner or later, Bhelabher mused.Whats your policy on intermarriage?None at all, at the moment, Shacklar confessed.But I hope to have one by the time I get back to HQ.Will you excuse me?The General went out the door.Dar counted mentally, ticking off seconds on his fingers.When he got to five, a joyful whoop resounded from the street outside.Bhelabher looked up, blinking, but Dar nodded.Shacklard been waiting a long time for this incident.
