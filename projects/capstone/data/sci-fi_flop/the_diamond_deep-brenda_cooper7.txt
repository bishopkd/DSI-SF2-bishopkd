She took a deep breath, two.There was no microphone.Two small dots had been fixed to her face, and two thin wires hooked over her ear, all of it far finer and lighter than Foxs equipment for the Fire.Naveen had promised they would send her voice through all of the space here and out to the rest of the station.Below her and above her, positioned in a variety of places, a live band hid and waited for her signal.Joel would be watching.The others would be, too.56     Onor led Marcelle toward the door to the bar.Close your eyes.Really?Really.Ill lead you.Allen had saved them a front table.Joel and SueAnne were already seated.It took a few moments to steer Marcelle safely through the crowd and sit her down.He made sure she was oriented to the large projection wall that was the biggest single feature of the bar.Open your eyes.He watched her eyes widen.The picture in front of her was so clear that Onor felt he could reach out and touch the huge black curtains on each side of the wide stage.At the moment, no sound went with the picture.Marcelle looked around at the rest of the bar while Onor watched her face for approval.They had new wood grained tables and chairs, with higher tables near the back wall so that spectators could see over the heads of the other patrons.The painting wasnt all done, and since Onor knew where to look, there was an unfinished feel to the whole place.Not that it mattered; the bar was full.Haric and Allen and a few of the old bartenders from the cargo bars filled orders and dropped multicolored drinks onto the robots trays as they finished them, moving so fast they never stopped, almost like a dance.Most of the patrons were from the Fire, but there were Deepers there, and even a few sentient machines scattered amongst the tables.The concert must have drawn them, or maybe Naveens advertisements about the bar.As far as he knew, they neither ate nor drank anything, much less got intoxicated.He shivered when he noticed that one looked exactly like the machines that had accompanied Koren when she stole the Fire from them.He turned away from machine watching as a decidedly not sentient serving bot trundled between their table and the one next to them, which was filled with the old leaders of the underground: Conroy and Aric and The Jackman.Onor stopped it and ordered a drink for himself.Marcelle asked for a flavored water.Joel seemed to be lost in his own world, perhaps contemplating the tour and Rubys absence from his side.He already had a half empty glass of alcohol, which wasnt like him at all.SueAnne let out a heavy sigh, and looked even more sour than he had been afraid Marcelle might.We could feed five hundred people for a month on what it took to build this.Or maybe save a few people, Marcelle added.We need play space for sick kids and a few more private rooms.Onor couldnt let them think this way.The bar is making more than were getting out of Exchange Five on any one day.Their drinks arrived and he took a deep, long swig.Warmth filled him, a happy shock to his system.I invested in it.Marcelle looked startled.I gave Allen a hundred credits to help buy the projectors.Anger edged SueAnnes voice.So instead of putting wages into the central bank, people have been giving it to Allen?So we can starve sooner?Lights flickered on the projection wall, brightening and then dimming the view of the stage, reflecting in her angry eyes.No, Onor said.We wont starve.Some credit is coming in from outside.And whats being spent inside is still here.It doesnt go away because it changes hands.Naveen is teaching me how credit works, and its not like you think.We dont need to worry about what gets spent inside Ash, among us.We need to be sure more comes into Ash than goes out.SueAnne looked entirely unconvinced, and Marcelle still looked slightly confused.Joel had no reaction at all.He watched the stage so closely Onor wasnt even sure he heard the conversation.The flickering light deepened and the wrinkles in his face, and stole the color from his cheeks.He sipped his drink.A bright spot bloomed on the projection wall.Naveen strode out as if he owned the stage.He held his head high and it seemed that he looked at each individual in the bar even through the airwaves; surely a trick of camera angles.Onor expected the sound to come up as Naveen started talking, and turned to see Allen fiddling with a set of controls in his hand.As the room quieted, the quiet from the stage became more noticeable.Naveens mouth kept moving.Finally there were two loud crackles, and then Naveen might have been screaming in their ears, Introduce Ruby the Red, the queen who burns with creative fire, the best new talent on the Diamond Deep.Ruby must hate that.Surely shed force Naveen to be less dramatic next time.Allen kept playing with the controls as Ruby walked across the stage.Joel looked like he wanted to stand up and reach a hand out and touch Ruby.She looked beautiful, and confident.Jali had done herself up proud.Ruby stood in the center middle of the stage for a long moment.Allen had gotten the volume right.When Ruby spoke, her voice sounded calm and smooth, like a good drink.Good evening.I am so very pleased to be here.I know many of you have heard my music.This is the very first time I have sung live for the people from the Diamond Deep.She paused to allow a light smattering of applause that was mirrored in the bar.Ill begin from the moment our people learned we were coming home.Music swelled; the first high notes of Homecoming played on instruments Onor had never heard, higher and more haunting than their own.As Rubys voice started right on beat, perfect, he let out a sigh of relief.If only he was with her.He raised his glass and smiled at Joel, who touched his glass to Onors.They both drank.57     As the last of the applause wound down, Ruby took a final bow.Sweat poured between her shoulder blades even though shed only sung ten songs; five of hers and five traditionals from the ship.After each song there had been clapping and applause.In between, as she parceled out a few sentences about the Fire between songs, there had been respectful silence.She had succeeded.She ran to the wings, the stage lights flicking off as she left it, house lights coming up behind her.She turned to look: people stood, some still staring at the place where she had just been, others gathering their things.She glanced at the board.Virtual numbers clicked down as people logged off, but the highest amount was posted there in glowing orange letters.Eighty seven thousand.The size of the audience hit her in the gut, and she turned away from it.Jali plucked at her sleeve and Ani came up from behind and whispered, You were magnificent.The dim light of backstage was enough to show how pleased Naveen looked.She glanced back at the gallery, still full of people.If you added it all up, there had been nearly a hundred thousand people, and all of them were people she had never met.She had no idea how shed been brave enough to sing to them all.We have to go, Jali said.Go where?Time to change.We have a party to go to.Her whole focus had been on the performance, and now she wanted to sit and eat something and relax.Instead, she was rushed to a dressing room where Ani and Jali pulled her stage clothes off and put her into a short blue dress with her signature multiple colors lining the neckline and falling down one side in ribbons that tickled her elbow.Naveen stood outside the door, shifting his weight and looking pained, but Jali fussed and whispered, No worry, no hurry.Just bring him a drink next time, Ruby whispered.She closed her eyes and swayed.She shouldnt be this tired.Sit, Jali said.She let the lock of Rubys hair she was working on fall.Was it that hard?So many people.She checked the mirror.She looked like she felt.Can I have some stim?Ill get it.Ani headed out the door, leaving Jali and Ruby alone.Can you do this?Jali asked.The concerts, or the parties?This party.Jali glanced toward the door Naveen had just knocked onagain.The one thats hes so impatient for.Ruby laughed.I dont think I have a choice.Jalis tight lipped return smile felt like confirmation.Ruby blinked and looked around.Wheres Min?KJ took her off somewhere.Hes probably giving her the third degree.Ruby winced.They had traveled a day, slept a night, and rose to prepare; Ruby had worked with light and instrument programs all day.Theyd have a few down days now.There were two to three days between each of the events Naveen had set up.They were going from where they had docked the Fire, out along the long line of the Deep and back.Weeks.Jali spent another ten minutes teasing Rubys hair into loose curls.As a last flourish, Jali slid Rubys feet into small white sandals.Ruby took a last long look in the mirror.Id rather wear one of our uniforms.Did you bring any?No.And you cant wear a made over military style uniform to a party anyway.We all did.On docking day.And we looked nave for it.Ruby frowned at the mirror and the dress.In truth, she loved being coddled, but it was at odds with what she felt.Kind of like the way this beautiful, vibrant society that had people like Lake and places like the Brawl in its underbelly.Like a surface smile from a thug with a fist below the table.Ani returned with three small cups of stim.Naveen only let me bring a little.He said we have to hurry.Of course he did.Ruby drank all three cups, one after another.What about a work jumpsuit?This is beautiful, but I feel like a present in it.Jali unclipped and reclipped Rubys hair, whatever she changed so small Ruby didnt see why she bothered.Look, you are a present to these people.Look how many came.They adore you.The people in the Brawl needed her more than these people.She had taken on a whole society once, but that whole society would have fit inside this concert hall.Can you make an outfit that looks like our old work jumpsuits?Like the last concert on the Fire?I can do anything if I have enough time.Bless you.The stim was helping.She felt like she could stay awake for another few hours.Lets go.They opened the door.Naveens face went from worried to pleased.Thats beautiful.Naveen held Rubys arm as they neared the party.The corridor of the Star Bear was bathed in the murmur of conversation.Instead of letting her through the door, he held her still for a second and spoke to someone she couldnt see.As Naveen urged Ruby forward she tried to gauge the number of guests at the party, but the inside of the room looked like a vast seething mass of color touched by a very soft, warm light.A wash of bright white light landed on her face, forcing her to blink.Naveens voice came from speakers overhead.Ruby Martin.An announcement of her presence.The closest people turned, greeting her, adding congratulations.Their dress and eyes and hair and makeup and jewelry demanded attention.Many were tall and thin limbed, obviously changed.The hands she shook had long painted fingernails, or long fingers, or seemed so strong they couldnt just be normal hands.The spotlight stuck with her for a minute, and then swung the other way as another name was mentioned.After that another, then another.Ruby leaned close to Naveen and whispered, Who are those people?One is another singer, one a writer, and two are part of the ruling Council.Theres a rumor that Stevenson himself might show up.Naveen had told her a little about the way the station was governed.Councilors dealt with the economy.Internal struggles were handled by a peacekeeper force like the reds from the Fire, but which wore no obvious uniforms.There was a defense force and a court system.Headman Stevenson oversaw the whole thing.Will you introduce me to Headman Stevenson if he comes?If he comes it will be to meet you.But first, I want you to meet Satyana.The owner of the Star Bear?She reached across Naveen to take another hand, this one tinged a slight orange, the fingers all sporting silver and blue rings.And a patron of yours.You made her a lot of credit tonight.The orange hand withdrew and they went on.The faces of people who came up to meet her began to blur by the time Naveen led her to a small table, and she was sure shed lost all track of names.A large woman who sat opposite a small one got up to give Ruby her seat, going to stand behind the small one.A bodyguard, then.The compact woman had brown skin, deep blue eyes of a color Ruby had never seen, brighter by far than her own pale blue ones, and thick black hair that flowed down her back in soft waves.She was absolutely beautiful, but none of that beauty came from her simple yellow outfit or from makeup or baubles.Rather, there was a strength in her that Ruby recognized instinctively.She had power.Feminine power.The hand that Satyana held out was unadorned, and when Ruby shook it, she felt calluses along the ridge of the womans palm.Pleased to meet you.Of course.Thank you for the lovely concert.Thank you for sponsoring me, and for holding this party.Satyanas gaze was friendly, but assessing.Rubys friends, including Naveen, had been seated at a nearby table and were already ordering drinks from a human waitress.May we get you anything?Tea, please.Something that will help give me energy.And water.Satyana smiled.Excellent.She turned to the woman behind her.Britta, will you also see that someone brings us a snack?Britta looked taken aback by the chore, but she faded into the crowd anyway.Satyana leaned close.I would like to tour you around the outside of the station tomorrow.Just us.It was part of what I made Naveen agree to in order to book you.Ruby had promised Joel she wouldnt go anywhere alone.Id like that.After all, Joel was far away.The little defiance felt good.Ill pick you up after lunch tomorrow.Wear something comfortable.Ruby liked her already.Britta appeared with blue liquid in small glasses and a plate of small candies, fruits, and round chips decorated with colorful spreads.Ruby took one of the chips.How long have you been here?She laughed softly.Longer than youve been alive.She gestured around the room.Most of the people who could afford to attend this are older than me, and more powerful.Although entertaining well does give one some sort of power, dont you think?I suppose.She had not seen anyone like these people in the Exchange, not really.The guests at this party were physically soft, with calculating eyes.Tell me stories.What do these people do?Satyana sipped from her blue drink.They run things.They manage credit, or ships, or people.A few have simply been given riches by their families.Ask me about a specific person and Ill try and tell you.Ruby pointed to a tall man with long white hair decorated in feathers.What about that one?He created a series of healthcare bots when he was young.Made it rich early.Now he mostly looks pretty, but once in a while he starts a new company, makes a bunch of credits, sells it, relaxes for a while.At the moment, hes in a rest period.Okay.She pointed at a tall womanalmost everyone in here was talla woman who was taller than most of the rest of them, her skin and face all reddish blue.Thats Ferrell Yi.She runs Exchange Five.She owns it?Satyana laughed.No.Each Exchange has a manager.But assume she is powerful, and that she is paid well.The Exchanges are all owned by the people, by all of us.Ruby raised an eyebrow.Well, and run by the Council.The profit they dont take gets used to pay for central services.Which are?Transportation.Air.Water.Basic education.The blue drink tasted sweeter than Ruby liked, and she had to work to drink it.Curiously, her thoughts almost immediately seemed clearer.Whats in this?Satyana had her own cup.Plants.They are chosen to add energy to your system.Its good.Does the Council pay for the Brawl?Of course.Although in a way, we all do.The credit comes from the tax.Satyana leaned over.Turn around.Its Stevenson.The Headman appeared from behind Ruby, offering her a hand.That was beautifully done.You grace our station.He was both tall and broad, with swirling brown tattoos on his forearms and neck, a simple black shirt that flowed over black pants and black boots, and strings of colored beads that might have come from the Fire.It rocked her to see her symbol on him, silencing her voice for a moment.She swallowed her reactionpart anger and part confusionand managed to say, Its a pleasure to meet you.Thank you for coming to hear me.His smile disconcerted her almost as much as the beads around his neck.How could I miss the newest sensation here?She blushed in spite of herself.Thank you for the greenery.It made Ash much prettier.He smiled.Youre welcome.She searched for words.The Diamond Deep is quite fascinating.There is much I could show you.Will you join me for dinner next week?Instinct told her no.But surely this was a man with power she needed to understand.Naveen keeps my schedule.Hell know if there is time.He had eyes the color of the tattoos on his arms, a brown similar to some of the colors Naveen favored, but the irises were a very dark black.He frightened her in a way no known enemy ever had.If it can be arranged, my assistant and my bodyguard will join us, of course.His eyes actually seemed to darken.But his smile widened and he gave a half bow toward her.I will have my people schedule time with you through the inimitable Naveen.He turned to Satyana.Excellent use of your venue.Youve done well tonight.Satyana inclined her head a very tiny amount, as if acknowledging his power.Thank you for gracing my party.He turned away then, and Ruby glanced over at Naveen.He was deep in conversation with KJ, and she wasnt even sure he had seen the Headman.But Min was staring hard at her.She turned back to find Satyana looking contemplative.He likes beautiful women.She eyed Ruby.He does not like to be told no.I have a partner.That will not matter very much to him.Then Satyana laughed.You are a spitfire, arent you?What is that?Brave.I like brave women.Satyana stood.She barely came to Rubys shoulder.Ill pick you up tomorrow morning.Naveen has the details.On the short train ride from the Star Bear back to their rooms, Ruby sat beside Min, her eyes so heavy she had to force them open.Her words sounded slurred even though shed had no alcohol all night.Im sorry I havent been able to talk to you yet.Thank you for coming.Min gave her an odd look.Thank you for allowing us to continue to watch you.That wasnt quite what Ruby had expected to hear.As youve watched me, what have you seen?Min went quiet.Ruby was almost asleep in spite of her best intentions when Min said, I dont know yet.You like attention, and you draw it.Men and women flock to you, and power comes to you.We need attention, and Im working as hard as I can to see we get it.A flashing light from outside of the train briefly illuminated Mins face, emphasizing the scar.Did you bring us here so you could have attention?To the Deep?Min nodded.We had to go somewhere.It wasnt a good answer, but she didnt have a better one.Min went quiet again.This was not the vibrant woman shed met in common long before they landed.Look, Ruby said, Youll get to see a lot here.There are more important things for you to watch than me.Min regarded her solemnly.Maybe this had been a mistake.It would help me if you could watch everything.Not just me.Watch it all.And tell meand whoever else you wanteverything you see.Im not hiding anything here.Im doing the best I can.Think of it as witnessing about me and for me at the same time.As witnessing for the colony.Min didnt respond one way or the other.But just as the train was stopping, she whispered, Your concert was good.Ruby whispered back, Thank you.58     The next morning, Onor attempted to work the groggy feeling out of his head by wiping down the chairs and tables in the bar.Robots had cleaned the floor after closing, so Onor was trying to get all of the crumbs and bits swept into his hand so they wouldnt land on the floor.Haric and Allen stood together, washing glasses in the bar sink.As Onor worked closer to the dishwashers, he asked, So what did we make last night?One thousand three hundred credits.More than hed thought.Profit?Well, not from outside.One hundred ten came in from outside, so if I listen to SueAnne, thats the most we could make.At least theyd made something.Onor glanced over at Haric.The boy had hardly said a word to him this morning.Maybe he was still smarting from Rubys refusal to take him on the tour.Want to go see the birds today?Im sure you earned that much of the credittransportations only five for both of us.Take me to a bar?You dont drink.Allen laughed and addressed Haric.You drank a little last night.Harics cheeks reddened.Onor frowned.Ruby had told Haric not to drink.Why a bar?I want to get a job.So I can learn how to earn more credit.Onor blinked at him.And I want to learn my way around.So he could find Ruby?Poor kid had lost Colin to the spiders and now Ruby had left him.Now?Harics steady gaze said yes, please with no words.Can I show you the birds first?An hour later, they stood inside the aviary Naveen had shown Onor.Haric stared for a long time, entranced and puzzled.I didnt know theyd be so much better than the picture you sent.Pretty cool, huh?Can we have one?Can we take one back?Onor laughed.Can you imagine SueAnnes face if we bring home another mouth to feed?Haric let out a long sigh and sat down on one of the benches, his eyes tracking a small, bright orange bird.Were not learning fast enough.We need more than a job for me.We need jobs for a thousand people.Youre starting to remind me of SueAnne.Haric frowned.Start with your own job.Lets go.They started at the bar just outside the aviary.This was Harics idea, so Onor stood outside and let him go in.Haric returned in ten minutes, a dejected look on his face.They want experience.You have experience.In our bars.Lie a little, and count the time you were in the cargo bars.They want ten years.Oh.Maybe the others will be better.They inquired at six barsall they could reach without taking another train.By then, Haric looked so tired his feet dragged and his shoulders slumped, so he looked his age.He wasnt going to get any kind of job offer while he looked that that.Maybe we can talk to Naveen, Onor said.He might have some connections.In the meantime, its opening time for our own bar.Haric had started dragging a few hours before closing time, so Onor had sent him home to dream of birds.With so few people, the robots had been left turned off and Onor and Allen were managing the whole bar, which had stayed pretty calm.It probably didnt hurt that Onor was known as one of Joels bodyguards, and thus someone who could fight.Allen went to encourage the locals home and Onor approached the only table with off site patrons, where a man and a woman were deep in conversation.Hed noticed them earlier.Apparently new to the bar, theyd been pointing out details about the construction and the art on the walls to each other when he served them.The woman was the taller, with a thin face.She reminded him of Marcelle, although she was lighter in coloring.The man was a stockier and shorter version of the woman; they could be brother and sister.She held up a hand in greeting as Onor approached.Were about to close.The man looked around.Can we talk to you?Of course.About what?Your losses, he said.Onor gestured Allen over to the table.Allen stopped by the bar on the way and grabbed a pitcher of water and four cups.As he poured he eyed the newcomers curiously.Do you like the bar?The man seemed mildly surprised by the question.Well, sure.Its simple.Onor downed half his water.Im Onor, and this is Allen.The womans voice sounded soft and full of backbone.And we have chosen to be friends of the People of the Fire.Onor frowned.You asked me about our losses.Do you mean the ship?Sort of.He didnt like secrets.So tell me what you did mean.The man sat back.Can you get Joel?So they knew something about the community.Why?We need a decision maker.Onor used his slate to send Joel a message.Then he sent a separate note to SueAnne, hoping Joel wouldnt mind.Allen offered to break his after closing rule.Would you like a real drink?No.The womans fingers went to her neckline, and he realized she was wearing one of Rubys necklaces.Or a replica of one.It looked like all of the beads were stone, which they hadnt had on the Fire.The gesture looked natural, but he wondered if she were sending a signal the way players messaged their teammates in a game of Planazate.We enjoyed Rubys concert the other day very much.Thank you.What did you like the best?The man answered, Her voice.The womans answer was more emotional.The song for Owl Paulie.The way it had layers, love and revolution all lined up.It must have been terribly romantic to have to fight your way to equality.Your story sounds like an adventure video, and Ruby looks like a real heroine.It must have been sointense.Allen looked unhappy with the conversation.Have you ever seen anyone killed?No, but weve known people who died.Of disease?Or who were killedlike in accidents.It doesnt happen much.We dont see death.She paused uncertainly.Or at least I havent.The woman reached for the pitcher and refilled everyones glasses.I admit that part must have been hard.Allenout of view of either of themshook his head in disbelief.Onor managed to keep a straight face.I was there when Owl Paulie told us all to rebel.I thought Ruby led the rebellion, the man mused.Oh, she did.Owl Paulie was dead by then.But it wouldnt have started without him.Do you have any pictures of him?the woman asked.We have pictures of you and Ruby and Marcelle and The Jackman and others, but I dont think we have any of Owl Paulie.Joel walked in, pushing SueAnne.The couple refused to give their names to Joel and SueAnne as well, which Joel took with a sour face.SueAnne looked like she had been dragged out of bed.She wore no jewelry and her gray hair flowed wispy and loose around her shoulders and touched the edge of her chair.She started the conversation.What can we do for you at this hour?You should look into how your cargo was sold.On the Exchange?Joel asked.There are records of every transaction that happens there.Your AI must know where to look.What AI?Onor asked.No one was supposed to know they had a copy of Ix.SueAnne reacted smoothly.Our community net here is not at an AI level.We have looked up some of the information.The man sounded hesitant.Maybe we can share some of it with you.What did you find?Joel asked.Do you know everything that was in your cargo bays?Onor could see Joel hesitate.Eventually he said, We have some records.We also have our memories.Do you remember a series of rocks from Gaithers World?The first place you went?Allen had been silent, but now he said, I played with them once, I think.They were heavy, right?And mostly black.They were geodes.That means they had crystals in them.The chemical makeup is very different from anything in our system, and the colors are pretty.One of Korens companies is creating a demand for jewelry made from these crystals.Thats a beginning.It dawned on Onor what they meant.So we should get paid a part of what she makes off of everything?The woman smiled.We believe the cargo was legally yours.She should not be getting anything for it.Even if its salvage, you should have far more than she gave you.Hundreds of times more.Okay.But why do you care?Onor asked.Perhaps we share the same enemies.Koren?Not only Koren.Others.We might be allies.SueAnne said, Really?Why?We hardly know our way around here at all.Im not even sure we can find a privy outside of this area yet.Why do you think we have anything to offer to you?Didnt you see how many people watched the concert?Onor bit his lip, immediately even more distrustful.Joel said, The Deep is nothing like the Fire.There, we knew who our enemies were and how to hide.You know some of your enemies.Koren.Anyone with power.Your coming and your story is a threat to the power structure here.Really?Joel asked.We dont appear to have much power.The man laughed.Stories of revolution have more power than you think.Especially when they have a flesh and blood avatar.Joel sat back and stayed quiet for some time.Then he looked at the man and asked, Would it put Ruby in danger if we help you?The woman appeared to be affected by Joels concern.She smiled softly at Joel and said, Shes already in danger.You all are.The man leaned forward and looked from Joel to SueAnne.It will serve both of our causes if you can question Koren in the Court of the Deeping Rules.We will help you to the extent we canwe cant get caught.But we will be working to weaken her in other ways.We cant allow the Fires cargo to be a fortune machine for her.Why not help yourselves and attack the woman who stole from you?SueAnne pursed her lips and looked at Joel, shifting the burden of choice to him.He simply said, Well consider what youve shared with us.The couple stood.We can ask for nothing more.Good luck.Dont underestimate Koren or anyone else currently in power.59     Satyana gave Rubys outfit a doubtful look.Can you belt that shirt?You really wont want anything flowing.Satyana wore a form fitting green jumper.Her shoes appeared to blend into the outfit, although when Ruby looked closely they were separate.The tops closed perfectly around the base of Satyanas calves and the tight fitting pants slid over them.A small but bulging full pack hung over one shoulder.I dont have anything like that, Ruby said.Ill see that Naveen knows where to get you one.Theyre great under pressure suits.Ruby realized shed missed the connection.Hold on.Let me find a better outfit.Tell your people Ill have you half the day.At least.Okay.Come in?Ill wait.Ruby went back into their rooms and dressed a second time.Jali, who shared a room with her, rolled over and opened her eyes.Noisy girl.I need something tighter to wear.Come look at what Satyanas wearing.Now?Well, maybe when we get back.Its kind of like our old uniforms only so tight its like wearing skin.Is uniforms all you think about?Why do I keep dressing you up?Ruby laughed.I really do need that jumpsuit.The one for the stage.To go with the microphone gun.You brought that damned thing from the ship?Yes.Its not exactly in context here.Ruby grinned.I know.Jali sat up and raked her fingers through her hair.In the mornings, she looked almost like a normal human being instead of a goddess of fashion.She narrowed her eyes and looked closely at Ruby.Are you feeling better this morning?As long as I dont think about it.You need a few days rest.Ill sleep when we get back to Ash.Jali looked more worried than she should.Ruby was tired, but shed driven herself through it yesterday at the concert with no problem.Shed get herself through today just as well.Ill be all right.Whatever it is, it will get better.Jali looked sour, but she said, Bring us back tales.Satyana looked at the tight gray pants and close fitting purple shirt Ruby wore.A little fancy for our trip, but much better.She led Ruby back to the Star Bear.The pressure suits here were a dream.In the Fire, shed needed to strip.Here, she needed bare feet and bare hands to slide into the boots and gloves, and to tuck everything else in.The material was as thin as underwear, and the helmets were clear and easy to see through, and so light she barely felt the weight.She understood Satyanas outfit nowwith no loose clothes or even seams to bunch up, she looked beautiful even in the pressure suit.There was no mirror, but Ruby suspected she looked rather lumpy.So, Ruby asked.Where are we going?I wanted to give you a sense of the size and complexity of the Deep.Think of it as a trade for a good concert.Satyana led her into an airlock.They stood together in the quiet moment of air escaping.The suit expanded and tickled her spine.Out the other side, they stepped into a cramped interior bay of the Star Bear.Ruby counted four little ships.We had these on the Fire, or something like them.I was never in one.They were for when we landed at planets, and of course, the last time we did that was hundreds of years ago.She remembered that Satyana could be hundreds of years old.Generations ago.Satyana used a series of lines to lead Ruby through null g to the smallest of the ships, a squat and ugly thing that stood on six legs and had other appendages folded against the hull.This is a repair bee.In a fit of imagination, we named it Honey.Ruby laughed, even though she didnt understand the reference.Satyana managed a slow, stately jump up into the doorway of the Honey, and extended a hand to help Ruby into the craft.Inside, Honey barely had room for the two of them and Satyanas pack in the front.Two more seats sat facing backwards, but they were full of tools and clothes.Good thing I didnt bring anything, Ruby said.Satyana laughed.Shes small, but shes fun.Once the hatches were all dogged down and everything appeared ready to go, Ruby asked, Can I take my helmet off?Not yet.But strap in.Ruby had to watch Satyana carefully to figure out how to get that done.The straps were wide and thick, and the buckles unfamiliar.A door irised open in front of them, and Satyana piloted the small craft through it so smoothly that Ruby barely felt the movement.Not that they were moving fast.Satyana spoke into her microphone, communicating with the ship.Exit check, please.She fell silent long enough for Ruby to wonder what an exit check was, when the ship responded, Neutralized.In response to Rubys quizzical look, Satyana said, It clears the ship of listening devices.I special ordered the Honey so that she has a shielded command and control system, and the ability to burn out unwanted tech.So someone was listening?Satyana laughed.Someone was hoping to.Like who?Satyana shrugged.Could have been a competitor.She must have noticed Rubys blank face, since she added, Someone who wanted to know more about my business so they could steal my customers.Maybe catch me saying something I shouldnt and get me in trouble.Wow.I dont understand the way you people think.Happens all the time.Its not something you can be nave about.In this case, maybe someone wanted a scoop on you.Naveen has given you value, and your concert last night added more value, so it could be one of his competitors instead of one of mine.Naveen told me to be careful who I talked to.He said youre safe.Did he?Satyanas fingers danced over a panel of light in front of her, shifting bars one way and then another too fast for Ruby to follow.She stopped for a moment and glanced at Ruby.It could have been one of your enemies.Everything seemed like a fight on this station.The very thought of living like that wearied her.But dont you have security?How would someone get in here?Wouldnt need to be a person.Satyana relaxed back into her chair.You can take your helmet off now.And loosen your seat straps, but dont take them all the way off.Satyana took her helmet and her shoes off.There are cameras too small to see; robots that would fit on the tip of your finger, and that separate into smaller robots and swarm back; there are pseudo AIs that people have figured out how to trick.The less competent robots around here are often hacked.Its a high stakes game for the bored.The air smelled of grease and metal and the closeness of a recycled atmosphere.Kind of like the Fire, only without the added scents of growing things and food.It felt good to be off the Deep and away from crowds.Youre right.This station is a wonder of confusing things.Ruby watched Satyanas profile.Could she take a risk?She took a deep breath.What about human/machine hybrids?I heard a rumor those existed.Theyre not allowed anywhere in the inside system.There are some at the Edge.I met one once.What happened?Why arent they allowed?In truth they are, at least in some ways.There are machine aids to the human brain.Mostly theyre legal for simple enhancements like better and clearer vision or hearing.Some more dramatic mods are illegal, but can still be obtained.Theres always a few want to be superheroes.But the process of going the other wayof putting a human brain into a machine?Thats illegal.Why?It destroys the human.And human brains in robot bodies go insane eventually.Almost always.The Honey had an actual window.Ruby touched it.She had never seen a true window to space; everything on the Fire had been a picture created by Ix and displayed for them.The station receded in the window.Are the hybrids who live at the Edge insane?Satyana shrugged.Ive only been there twice.In general, its frowned on to go to the Edge.One can only come up with thin excuses so often.Why would you go to the Edge?Adventure.Curiosity.Kindness.A patron paid me to go there and bring a whole barge of food once.I suspect she was also smuggling other stuff to them, but I was as nave as you then.In the Star Bear?Oh no, this was three hundred years ago.I was young and stupid then.So are all the people on the Edge hybrids?No.Satyana smiled.You should worry more about the challenges you have here.There are even more than you think.She grinned.And I plan to present you with a proposition.Ruby waited.Satyana fiddled with the controls, slowing the craft so it drifted above the station.The Star Bear filled most of the window, a large rounded oblong of a ship with nothing svelte about it.Satyana stared at it, as if she seldom saw her own ship from this viewpoint.There is opportunity here.A lot of it.She goosed the little ship so it drove backward, making the Star Bear look a little smaller.Youre new.You have the freshest eyes that have seen our society.Maybe in forever.What do you think?I love how varied everything is.The birds are amazing, and the food.But some things here are wrong.Tell me.Well, its hard to live here.Everyone has to earn air and food somehow.We just made them for everyone.Satyana drove the Honey forward, toward the outside center of the station.The Creative Fire was a ship.This is a society.Think of the Deep as more like a planet than a ship.People on planets dont take care of their own?Just people on starships?Satyana frowned.Thats not what I mean.Then can you explain the Brawl?Satyana focused very intently on the controls for the Honey.Can you?Ruby whispered.In any society, there are winners and losers.So you hide the losers?Satyana still wasnt looking at Ruby.Its not hard to earn air and food.Three days or so a week of work.Ruby stayed quiet to force Satyana to think or talk, a trick shed learned from Joel.They flew slowly over and around structures.Once the Honey came too close and a small warning beep filled the cabin.Ruby didnt comment on it.Time stretched, only slightly awkward since there was so much to see.Satyana broke first, laughing, her face relaxing.People tell me Im single focused.Are all revolutionaries so fucking irritating?Do you believe that if you dont talk about the Brawl it isnt there?No.Have you ever gone there?No.Even just to see it?No.The Honey crept up over a pile of arms and booms and other structures and opened onto a field of bubbles open to the sun.Each of them looked mostly clear on the outside, full of greens and golds on the inside, and in a few places, dots of orange.One of our agricultural fields.There are five, and every time the station grows by a certain amount of new people, another agrifield is created and planted.The sixth one is being designed now.See the dark lines at the edges?Each bubble had a dark top, all of them oriented the same, although a few looked darker that the others.Yes.Those will flow down the bubbles at a certain time, like a sunset.Agribubbles keep the stations day and night cycles, which are synced to Lyms.Its gives the plants a cycle they understand, with built in day and night.Ive never seen a sunset.The Honey floated above the bubbles.The smallest of them was ten times the size of the little ship, the largest ten times that again.Is it all food?We plant a bubble of flowers or greenfield plants in every fieldlike the ones that you see in pots around most habs.Its something this station is proud of, one of the reasons the Deep grew in the beginning.Beauty for the sake of itbeauty because the human soul needs it.The others all do this now, of course.Ruby knew Satyana was trying to change the subject, but she couldnt help herself.Is that enough food for everyone?Of course.We also sell food to ships that come through here to dock.So we pay to grow it and we make the poor pay to eat it?Satyana looked frustrated with her.Youve got to pay the people who work here.She pointed.Theres a forest bubble in the middlesee the big one?Theres only three on the whole station.Its part of why we flew this way.She nudged the Honey closer.They make nothing.Theyre there to be beautiful, and to keep a complex ecosystem to grow certain medicines in.I think theyre also there because people love them.There are even fake rocks, so its almost like being on a planet.Some of the richer people here who started on Lym like to vacation there.Its expensive to go to them, but I can take you some day.If Ruby understood perspective and size and distance in this situation, the trees inside were enormous.There were trees in the aviary, and those had astounded her.These would dwarf them.Are there birds?Some.Smaller ones.No mammals though.Ruby frowned.Meaning no animals?Insects and birds.I want to go to Lym sometime.None of us have ever even seen a planet.She had trouble looking away from the forest bubble.I appreciate the things youve done for me.Setting up the concert.Taking me out here.It would be even more credit for you to take me inside of the forest bubble, right?You made me a lot of credit last night.Id like for that to happen again, for you to come back to the Star Bear and perform.I enjoyed that.I also want you to understand some things about the Deep.I think you may be able to help me some day.Many things happen on the station because people can help each other.Ruby tried not to react badly to the slightly condescending tone Satyana was using.Maybe it meant the woman would underestimate her.What do you need help with?There are a lot of powerful people on the Deep.Factions, if you will.People who have resources.Like you?Satyana laughed.No.Well, yes.But like me with many, many more credits.Koren is one of them.The woman who bought the right to greet you.Ruby swallowed.Bought the ability to greet them?She didnt present it that way.Of course not.You wouldnt have understood that anyway.Rubys cheeks warmed.Maybe she wasnt being underestimated.Maybe she was stupid, after all.Not much is as simple as it appears here, is it?Of course not.Satyana pointed at a series of bubbles with yellow golds and soft greens in them.Those are grain fields.We grow many kinds of grains.She couldnt focus on grain.Her head whirled at the idea of people bidding to take advantage of her and her people.How many people offered on the ability to greet us?Satyana shrugged.At least a few.It made the newsor more accurately, Naveen reported on it.Thats what made me notice at all.The Deep is huge, and a lot happens here that very few people notice.Did you bid?Satyana laughed.I couldnt.Im not in a discipline, and even after all these years, Im not exactly in the middle of the power structure here.Is Koren really a historian?Yes.Shes the stations main historian.But any of a number of heads of disciplines could have won.Engineering.Social Engineering.Medical.So it wasnt really a complete free for all?The disciplines are backed by credit.Koren had backers.Who?We dont know yet.We?Me or Naveen.Rubys stomach felt sour.They werent bidding to greet us.They were bidding to steal the Fire.Satyana reached for the small pack.Thats not quite accurate.They were bidding for your cargo, and for your information.New information can give people who want to craft new products an edge.She dug out a blue square and held it out toward Ruby.I dont really like those.This one is good.Okay.She touched her tongue to the square, let the sweet flavor sit in her mouth.It is good.So people competed to steal from us.They compete for everything here, though.Right?Whats so different?Nothing.Im trying to make sure you understand that there are people with a lot of power.She drove the Honey to the edge of the field of agribubbles, and pointed past it.See the habitats on the edge there, the big ones?Sure.Thats one of the places that some of our most influential people live.I cant take you there.All of the ways into them are keyed and hidden, and the prox alarms go off before you get a ship like this close enough to see anything.Special trains connect those places to the other habitats.Ruby stared at the private bubbles, lost in thought.But youll be invited to them.I wanted you to have context.How do you know Ill get invited?You already have been.They floated silently over the agribubbles, high enough to look out at the homes of people with power Ruby was having trouble imagining.What do you want from that?Why?Satyana shook her head.To start with, I want you to meet some people.Naveen has made you attractive to the common people of the station, but to get true safety, you need to meet people who may give you what I did, only at a higher level.Ruby thought a moment.You gave me a place to play, but youre like Naveen.More credit went to you than to us.Satyana gave her a long look.Were driven by that.By credit.All of us.But dont see us as that shallow.I want some of the same things you do.What things?More fairness.Ruby ate the blue square, slowly.This one was sublime; as different from what they had been fed during quarantine as the Fire was from the Deep.Even though it tasted good, food didnt calm her stomach as much as she expected it to.Satyana squinted at her.Thats not enough for lunch.I know.Im not hungry.You look queasy.Should I take you home?No.When would she have another chance to see the station from near space?Ix had filled the map table with images on the way in, but this was much more intimate.Satyanas face had grown worried.It wouldnt do to have something happen to you when were way out here.The Honey is too small for a decent medikit.Im all right.Take a good look at those bubbles.Youll meet people that most residents of the Deep dont even know exist.You may be invited to their houses.This is nearly impossible, but for you its happening without effort.Promising Satyana anything felt wrong.I can think about it.My first focus needs to be on my people, on getting us established.This will help you.If you get more popular, youll earn more credit.Ruby stared at the huge bubbles, only part of the station.She couldnt imagine the power it took to build them, or the technology.All of the control that the greens and the reds had wielded now seemed small.The petty authority that she and Joel had now, which was more like thankless work than being a captain and his lover, seemed even smaller.She wished Onor were here.His fascination with power could be useful.The view still made her think of the Brawl.She took a sip of water, remembering how so many people had told her less than the truth.She hadnt caught Naveen in lies yet, and Naveen trusted Satyana.Can you tell me who you want me to meet?Satyana looked like she had expected more, but she responded with grace.No.But I will see that you meet them.Ruby didnt like the secrecy.She stared at the huge bubbles of life in front of them and pursed her lips.Perhaps she could use some of her influence more directly.Do you have any work that some of my people can do?Paid work?Will that help persuade you to help me?It will earn my gratitude.We need ways to learn how to survive here.Satyana sat silently at the controls, looking out over the habitat bubbles.You really do want to save everyone, dont you?Thousands of people?Of course I do.Im responsible for them.Youll break your heart.Maybe it was already broken in this mystifying and difficult place.Ill take you back.Belt in.Rubys stomach argued with her and she felt cramped as she strapped back in, the lower strap across her waist compressing her belly.It took a half an hour of steady flying to return to the Star Bear.On the other side of the airlock, KJ, Dayn, and Ani stood against the wall, looking as though they hadnt been worried.Dayn raised an eyebrow at her.Didnt you promise Joel you wouldnt run away without one of us?Satyana shook her head as if bemused, and then lied smoothly.The ship was too small for three.She glanced at Ruby.Ill release you to your keepers.Next time you call home, have someone pick three men and three women to send over here to work.Not enough.Can I send forty?Satyana stopped and gave her a cool, measured look.Twenty.For two weeks.Then well evaluate.Theyll have to be excellent, and theyll have to start at half wages until theyre trained.Remember, this is a business.How could she forget?Thank you.You cant go off with people by yourself, KJ echoed Dayn as soon as Satyana was out of earshot.If shed stolen you, we would have never found you.KJs voice sounded smooth like always, calm to the core.Nevertheless, Ruby sensed tension.I didnt mean to worry you.Ill have to tell Joel.Why?Because I work for him.Rubys feet felt heavy and thick after all that sitting.She leaned against the wall.Dont you work for both of us?Didnt you hear I just got us twenty jobs?Thats a good thing, KJ said.But if anything happens to you, I may not be able to go home.Im here in Joels stead to watch over you.And Im an adult.Words were getting hard to get out and she slumped over.Are you okay?Ani asked.Just give me a minute.Catch her, Dayn said.Then there were arms around her, and the world spun inside her head and her belly and she felt herself being lifted.60     Onor, SueAnne, Joel, and Allen sat around the bar table where they had met the strangers the night before.Once more, the bar was closed, the scent of cleaner in the air stronger than the leftover traces of food and spilled alcohol.The table in front of them held only simple breads and water, a sign that Joel was in warrior mode.Joel was almost always above still, but Onor wished for more than water.It might be a long conversation.Joel spoke first.I didnt invite anyone else because rumors that weve been taken advantage of could be dangerous.He looked from one to another of them, his face serious.Onor frowned.Ruby would have played it by sharing it with everyone.But when it was his turn, he said, Okay.All right, Joel sat back.What do you think of this claim?Can we verify it?Allen asked.There could be real danger in taking Koren on.SueAnne spoke next.Someones got to actually spend time learning how we would even talk about this.The couple last night implied that Koren is breaking laws, but who would we appeal to, and why would they listen to us?I can figure out some of that from here on my slate, and after that, maybe I can head to the Exchange and see what else I can find.Ive developed a few contacts there.Thanks.Joel glanced at Onor.I think these people are right.Remember, I didnt like her from day one.Naveen didnt either.But I also dont like what they wouldnt tell us.They have their own goals.How do we know theyll protect us?Joel gave him an approving look before going all serious again.We dont.And we must be very careful what we say to whom.Koren could have spies here.Like the whispering women?Allen asked.Joel laughed.Irritations with no teeth.But strangers come in here.If one side of this argument found us, the other side could do so as well.True, Allen said.Ill watch out for that.Bars are the best place in the world to hear about things.Joel grunted at that.Onor spoke up.I have an idea about verification.Tell me.Use Haric.Hes an old hand at mingling, hes looking for jobs out there, and was before these people found us so it wont look like hes doing anything new.No one will think we gave him anything important to do.Hes too young.Joel frowned.He wants to do something that matters, Onor said.He would also recognize some of the cargo.He was a cargo rat.SueAnne looked at Joel.We cant do without you or Onor.Allen is best used here.So you do need help, and Haric is about the most earnest boy Ive ever met.I think he can do this, and that hed be happy about the chance to help.Onor addressed SueAnne.Hell need some credit.And you dont have any hidden here from the bar?Allen stiffened, but Onor saw her point.Thatll keep it off the official books.SueAnne stared Allen down until he nodded.It might be dangerous, Joel said.I know.If anything happened to Haric, Ruby might scratch his eyes out.61     Ruby opened her eyes and blinked to focus.She remembered waking a few times before, but she couldnt remember any conversations, or that she stayed awake for very long at all.This time, Ani and Jali were sitting at a table in her room, playing a game that required them to slide their slates back and forth between each other.You still dont think it was poison?Ani whispered.Shes looked steadily worse since we left the Fire.I think shes sick of this place, Ani noted.I certainly am.Ruby pushed herself to sit up.Her lips and sinuses were so dry it hurt to breathe and her head ached.Is there water?Jali looked up, dropping the slate onto the table.On your bed stand.She stood up and handed Ruby the glass.How do you feel?Her stomach still hurt, somewhere deep inside.But she couldnt say anything about that; it was too important to be strong.They all needed this tour.When is the dinner?What dinner?Ani asked.The one last night?Oh.I slept that long?We made excuses for you.Min and Naveen and few others went.They said the food was fabulous.What did you tell people?That you were too tired from the concert, and that youd perhaps had a bad reaction to some food.Naveen appears to have gotten Min drunk.Thats about the only thing we heard thats worth reporting.Is Min okay?Shes sleeping it off.Food.She should be hungry.The water helped.Maybe after she drank some more water, shed be hungry.Im sorry.Not food, I hardly ate anything, and Satyana ate what I ate.Jali laughed.Dont be sorry for wearing yourself out.Youre doing it for us.Her brows furrowed.Maybe you should sleep some more.Ruby stood up, tested her strength, shook her head.I want to clean up, and eat.Ani said, Maybe we should bring one of our doctors over.Jali stood next to Ruby, encourage Ruby to drape an arm over her shoulder.Ill ask KJ about it.No, Ruby said.Ill be fine.Im sure I just wore myself out.I havent really stopped since we got here.Maybe since the robot spiders.Thats got to be it.An hour, a shower, and a few pieces of bread later she did feel better.There.Maybe you can buy me a days time to keep resting?I have some songs I need to write.Ani laughed.Maybe you do feel better.62     Onor lay beside Marcelle, one hand on her swelling stomach and the other propping his head up.She looked exhausted.Hed tried to get her to do less, but shed simply looked at him with a who would do this better?look and hed known not to press his luck.Are all of the children all right today?Yes.We let two go home, in fact.But theres three women in with something strange.Theyre exhausted, I think.The worst is one of Lyas whispering women.She came in, claimed she was exhausted, and then passed out.Luckily she was sitting on the bed when she fell over.Lya made sure someone sat with her the whole time.When it was Lyas turn to watch over her, I visited with her.She looks so haunted still.Her hands shook.It was really weird.I asked her if she knew what was wrong and she told me no, she doesnt.She babbled about Ruby making sure they all stay locked up in here so they cant go out and about.Its as if just being stuck in Ash is killing her.Could they be working too hard?Sure.Maybe Ill pass out next.Get one or two days of sleep in.Dont you dare.Pass out.You could do the sleeping bit, though.You could use it.Youre not exactly well rested.He didnt answer that.How is school going?I overheard a group of the teenagers talking about figuring out how to go find their fortunes on a spaceship.Onor chewed on his lower lip.They need to make their fortunes doing something.Marcelle rolled over to face him.They need to help support us all.Ruby told me once that her biggest fear is that we wont all stay together.That the people of the Fire will scatter and get absorbed.I remember her face when she said itshe was fierce.What did you tell her?Marcelle asked.That for now, shes right.If we want everyone to survive, we have to work together.But in the long run?If we learn enough to get along here, well go off into the Deep or off on other ships.Well mix up with the people here.Yeah.Marcelle didnt sound happy.The hard part is getting the kids to know the difference between now and in the future.It will really hurt if we lose all of the teens.Are they studying hard?As hard as we were when Ruby demanded we learn how to pass Ixs mythical test to get us into the other levels.Ill talk to Joel about it if I can.Marcelle looked dubious.Arent you guarding him?Sure.Today we went over the books with SueAnne.Then we met with Haric to get him ready to go out into the world and search for bits of our cargo.But I wasnt alone with Joel once, and the meeting with SueAnne had five people in it.I stood against a wall and listened.How does Joel look?Like hes missing half of himself.Like hes distracted.Sometimes.Other times hes focused as hell.Marcelle touched Onors cheek.He is missing half of himself.Onor winced.Marcelle put a finger over his lips.You are too, I can see it.You miss her.Im worried about her.Of course you are.We all are.But its working, right?People are paying to see her?The last time I saw SueAnne she actually had a smile on her face.Onor nodded.SueAnne still talks in time.She said Ruby gained us all two weeks in one concert.But the next ones not for two days and its been two days, so well have lost almost a week of that before she sings again.She cant do this forever.I know.The community had enough days of credit to get through the rest of the pregnancy.Marcelle would give birth in two months.But if they all ended up in the Brawl, the Deep would take the baby.Theyd take all of the children.Every day, he managed to go about his tasks and to keep learning, but under his determination there was always an uneasy fear, and below the fear, a sense of being unmoored.He rubbed his fingers lightly along the soft skin of Marcelles cheek and tucked a stray dark curl behind her ear.Her stomach bounced against him.He whispered.Kicking?Kicking.He sat up so that he could put both of his hands on her tummy.He held them still there for a long time, waiting for another kick.Marcelle watched him with wide, soft eyes peering up from a face that had grown thinner with her pregnancy.If you wait long enough, it will kick again.Does it hurt?It tells me the baby is alive.It reminds me why I have to keep going.It helps me, too.Not just the kicks.The baby at all.It keeps me going.The ends of her mouth quirked up.Really?Are you happy about it?No.He wished they hadnt created such a fragile thing right now.Im scared for it.I want to make sure we give it a future.It keeps me working to understand this place, to try and find out how to get back some of what is ours.It gives me something more to care about.More?More than you.More than all of us.The look on her face made him realize he needed to say more.I want us all to be safe.I love you.As if it agreed with him, the baby kicked.63     Dayn walked in front of Naveen and Ruby, looking left and right, alert.He had taken on a shepherding role since the tour began.From time to time he looked back at Ruby, as if making sure she was still there.He was so serious it made her feel warm and a bit odd; Dayn had been her watcher since she was essentially Foxs captive years ago.KJ walked on her other side.Ani, Jali, and Min all followed close behind.She felt surrounded, enclosed.Almost suffocated.Naveen put a hand on her arm.This will be the best after concert party ever.Youll be amazed.The man who put it on for youGunnar Ellenssonowns the biggest cargo operation between here and Mammot.What do they take back and forth?She remembered the game.Mammot doesnt have as much as Lym.There are precious metals which are more easily mined than made.I thought your invisible machines could do anything.They can.Some things they do better than nature.Others, not so much.Remember, we can live on food squares, but we thrive with real food.Where are we going?Now Naveen grinned even wider.The party is in one of the secret bubbles.She didnt think secret was the right word.More like hidden in plain sight, like a taunt.Satyana had showed her the outside of the bubble homes of the ultra rich.Ix had shown them the whole outside of the station.His excitement was riding high, his eyes shiny, his breath already laced with a tinge of alcohol.Ruby didnt like him in this mood, didnt appreciate him being so sure of himself.It made her nervous.But for now, she needed him.She took his arm and smiled.They boarded a small train of cars that had clearly been designed to carry people and cargo along a single wide corridor that passed between bubbles.The seats felt soft and looked as if they had just been recovered.Silver handholds flashed as the car passed under bright lights.At the end of a fifteen minute ride, the train doors opened and a lighted floor led them into a thin corridor that forced them single file.KJ stayed right in front of her.He looked as calm as anyone approaching a new place for an exciting secret party might, but she smelled his anxiety.Naveen followed Ruby, with Dayn looming behind him.The entire time they walked the corridor, Ruby felt as if there were eyes on her, like when she was in a crowd and turned to find someone staring intently at her from close range.They rounded a bend and a door swung open, washing the corridor in laughter and music, transforming it into a party.Ruby put on her best meet and greet smile and stepped into the room.The scent of fresh cut fruit and vegetables mixed with sweet desserts and the tang of alcohol.A band played stringed instruments and hand drums on an ornate stage that jutted out from a wall so the musicians stood above the crowd, looking down.A tall and perfectly proportioned man stood in front of her.His skin was as black as Anis, accentuated by the white and gold clothes he wore.Sparkling golden eyes that were as odd as Korens eyes matched the gold piping on his sleeves and the gold chains spilling down his chest in a tangled river.Hello, beautiful Ruby the Red, woman of fire.I am Gunnar Ellensson, and I am pleased to offer you the honor of joining me at a party thrown ...he let an exaggerated pause go by, for you.Come in.He bowed and held out his hand expectantly.Ruby managed not to react to the overly effusive greeting, but to just hold her hand out and let him take it.I dont deserve such honor.Oh, yes, you do.You saved your people once in the past, and they love you.You are saving them again, and they still love you.It is rare for a leader to be so good and so bright.She had to work to withhold her gag reflex.Show me and my guard around?You have no need of a guard here.She gestured toward KJ.Think of him as my friend.There was no obvious sense of resentment as Gunnar smiled and held a large hand out to KJ.Pleased to meet you.She wondered what KJ thought of the excesses surrounding them.He didnt look happy.Gunnar said, I cannot leave my post as greeter just yet.Perhaps you can enjoy the riches of the feast prepared for you, and sip from a refreshing, cold drink?I would like some fresh juice, Ruby said, And a piece of fruit.Gunnar looked away and whispered something, as if into thin air, and then turned back to Ruby.I will find you soon.Ruby almost succeeded at getting her entourage to one of the tables that practically dripped food before a threesome of tattooed men hailed her and blocked her way, holding out hands, murmuring of her success.Others recognized her, and surrounded her quickly.The fashion here was the most exotic she had seen, as were the modifications to the human form.Size varied widely, as well as strength and color.A pink woman with pink hair and baby blue eyes half the size of her face pushed through the crowd to congratulate Ruby on her concert.She was followed by a near albino woman with the wide shoulders of a man and large breasts that nearly spilled out of a tight fitting black dress.Satyana slid through the crowd, dressed plainly compared to the exotics that surrounded her.Here, her simplicity stood out even more than it had on the Star Bear.She winked at Ruby.Thank you for the workers.I have started training them.Youre welcome, and thank you.Im sure theyll do well.Were used to hard work.Do you feel better?I must have been very tired.Im sorry for any inconvenience.You need to protect your health.I want you to come to the Star Bear to sing again.Do you know when youll be back?I have five more concerts booked.I plan to go back home afterward.Ill ask Naveen to book you.Satyana managed to look both proud and irritated at once, which made Ruby think shed gotten her answer right.The Diamond Deep was so full of undertones that she usually felt like she was tripping over them.Ruby planned to protect her demand to go home.Shed told Naveen how much it mattered to her, but hed been drunk when she did that, so she had no idea if he remembered.A group of five identical women dressed in flesh toned mesh with sequins sewn over their crotches and breasts pushed between Satyana and Ruby, and Ruby held her hand out to them.Greetings.They practically simpered.Excess surrounded her.Opulence.Many of the partygoers might as well have been screaming look at me, look at me, me, me, me.By the time a small serving bot was able to push through the crowd, Ruby was thirsty and her voice felt ragged.Gunnar Ellensson came up shortly after the serving bot and took her arm.Allow me to tour you.KJ took her other side.Dayn and Ani moved to join them, but Gunnar waved them away.Dayn looked angry, and Ruby gave him a small hug and whispered in his ear, Ill be all right.He didnt look happy, but he stepped back, taking Ani with him.Lets go.Gunnar led them through an irising door and along a short tunnel into an entirely different bubble than the large one that held the party.Ruby gasped and slowly turned from side to side, taking in the view of cliff faces adorned with hanging vines in a flourish of flower so thick it appeared that rivers of purple and blue and yellow ran down the cliffs and disappeared into striking blue, green, and orange red forest foliage.Paths wound through meadows.A stream ran in the center of the whole thing, burbling over rocks and through flowers.Gunnar gave her a few moments before he spoke.This is as close to a planet as you can see anywhere on the Deep, or anywhere in system except on Lym and Mammot.I designed it so that I had a place where I could feel at home.This is all for you?And for my family and closest friends.It is also a gymnasiumthere are climbing paths and rope paths and other challenges that neither of us is correctly clothed for now.He looked at her dress, a pale yellow that clung to her hips, lined with soft gray fringe that swung as she walked.Soft gray boots came up nearly to her knees, open at the top and loose so that she had to walk carefully to make them feel right.I can point them out to you, and perhaps you will grace my home again in the future and try them out.He took her hand in his.She allowed it for only a moment, and then took it back.His skin had felt dry and warm and he had squeezed her hand as if wanting to keep it.You lead, she said.He pointed out flowers and trees, naming them.The path was firm enough under her feet that she felt secure even in her heeled boots.This is really all yours to decide what do with?Of course.I made it.Back on the Fire, she had always loved parks.They were where she went to take refuge, to think.Where she ran.Where she met her friends.Where she held her parties.The idea of creating and owning a park of her own was one she understood even while it offended her.Gunnar pointed out a climbing route that KJ asked questions about, giving Ruby time to sit on a bench and rest her feet and her voice.The air smelled better than any air she had ever smelled anywhere, like plants and water and flowers and with almost no hint of humanity.The faintest breeze blew stray hairs softly against her cheek.Every time she turned her head a new wonder appeared from amidst the profusion of life.A small green bird with a long beak sipping from a red flower.A tiny vine clinging to a tree trunk, covered with pink flowers that nearly obscured pale green leaves the shape of hearts.This was prettier than the graphics in the game Adiamo, fresher than the park at home on its best day, more astounding than her first sight of the aviary had been.The aviary was available to anyone who could spend the credit to visit.This ...this was private.It belonged to one man.The sheer weight of expenditure astonished her.And yet Gunnar Ellensson had been described as a rich merchant.As one of many.Satyana had shown her a froth of private bubbles.Ruby wanted one of her own.She wanted to design this much secret beauty, to have it to retreat into with her family.She could imagine choosing trees and flowers, shaping waterfalls.Waterfalls!She had never imagined anything so rich, so beautiful.The fact that she wanted it made her tense and angry.What else did this excess, this beauty, imply existed on the Deep?The garden surrounding her defined power in a far more subtle way than the vast bubble party and its glittery crowd.The contrast between this place and the Brawl mixed up inside her heart and her stomach, souring it.Or maybe it was already sour from whatever illness dogged her.Regardless, even in the bright, fresh air she felt like throwing up.Ruby still felt faint an hour later when she stood on the raised stage.Color swirled below her.Multicolored faces peered up at her.Bots and human servers danced through the crowded floor.Three drummers remained on the stage, standing in a loose semi circle around her.They felt too close, as if herding her toward the edge, but she couldnt exactly turn around and hiss at them to leave, nor could she explain that she felt dizzy still, and the edge seemed too near her feet.Gunnar Ellensson spoke from the far corner of the room, his voice loud and commanding.Even the robots stopped for him.Allow me to present Ruby Martin.She is the queen of flame, a leader from The Creative Fire, and an ambassador for her people who come from our past.He let a beat of silence fall.Ruby stood still.People watched her.Gunnar continued.Ruby has agreed to grace us with three songs.Lets welcome her.Hands clapped and two people whistled.The drummers began a steady cadence.Ruby took a deep breath and forced out as genuine a smile as she could muster.This is a song for one of us who is now dead.He was like a grandfather to me.He taught me to be brave and to be curious and to hope when there is no hope.She started The Owls Song.Some of the audience knew it.They must have watched the video of the actual funeral, which now seemed so far away she no longer recognized the girl who had barely been brave enough to sing there.At the end, the applause was loud although she couldnt tell how sincere it was coming from this strange crowd.She said, Thank you.Thank you.
