C. E  ia  + stron [translation: bearer of the echo]      Luna Athenaeum  Record Hall 19.134       THE FALL OF EUROPA      A cavernous tear cleaved through the high ceiling, dust and debris fell, a single scream echoed down the endless corridor, and Ava Lucasta knew they had come.The walls around her appeared as though to melt away before her aged eyes, dissolving from soft ashen grey to a sinuous stream of deathly black slime.A thousand drums pound and beat and her heart galloped within her weakening chest.But Ava Lucasta had a task to complete.The fate of the Istron people she held tight within her shuddering palms.She took a deep breath, steadied her trembling arm which had been resting, knuckles worn, upon the banister beside.And she ran.Her mind raced and her bare feet creased in pain as she hastened down the corridor.No longer silent, the concave embankments that guarded her home had kept the army at bay for as long as they could.But its pounding rhythm advanced toward the heart of the sanctuary, far beneath the ice sheets of the frozen moon of Jupiter where the Istron children slept.Lucastas home, though concealed, unknown, and considered the most protected place in the established galaxy, was about to be laid to ruin.Above, among the higher stratums of impenetrable ice, scores of bodies marched, uncounted weapons were charged, a great many cheers roared out, and long years of propitious plans merged into a single force.It was an almighty storm that had brewed.By morning, control would rest with the army that had gathered.As the walls of the refuge trembled and shook, Lucasta entered quickly into the girls dormitory and headed for the bed at the farthest end.There a cherry haired young girl slept soundly.She woke her in silence.There wasnt time to rouse the others, though it killed her that she couldnt warn them; they were trapped down here, and very soon they would all be dead.Lucasta pulled the young girl from the dorm and half dragged her down the rumbling corridors.Left and right, down low and lower still.Where are we going, Lucasta?the girl asked.Shhh now child.Come.Faster now.The master had asked for this one, and this one alone.Bring her to me, he had said.She is a single hope, down among this dark.Her capacity for survival is above all others.I have seen it.This child will survive tonight.And so she pulled her alongside, surrounded by confusion and fear as the army above closed in.She prayed.She pleaded with fate that there was time ...In minutes they reached the rumination chamber.Huge, emerald copper doors opened without a hand and they walked silently across the dark marble floor.In the centre of the room sat a young boy, cross legged.His eyes were closed.They moved forwards until they stood before him, the doors closing involuntarily behind.He opened his eyes and looked up.Master, she said.We dont have much time.He blinked, looking from her to the girl, and then back to Lucasta.How far?She shook her head.Much too close and gaining foot by the second.Theyre coming for you, Peter.Its you they want.We have no time at all, he said, and he turned to the girl.How do you feel, Ximma?Frightened.You have no reason to be frightened, Peter said as he rested a palm on her shoulder and lowered her to the floor.Not while Lucasta and I are here.Lucasta watched carefully, backing away and sitting upon a long marble settle bordering the room.Do you dream?Peter asked Ximma.The young girl mumbled a timid yes and looked across to her; Lucasta smiled, nodding receptively though she knew nothing of Peters intentions.Good, he said.And what do you dream of?Theyre ...frightening.Frightening?Yes.What frightens you, Ximma?The little girl breathed in deep.Humans.They continued the quiet exchange for minutes more, seemingly unaware of the marching and the drums and the fire which raged all around them, deep beneath Europa and descending toward the lonely chamber.Lucasta bowed her head.The old woman trusted Peter.She listened to his voice, focusing on the gentle tone and youthful melody of his words.Imagine something for me if you will, Peter said to the quivering girl.Dont think too much; though dont allow your mind to wander.Simply close your eyes.In your minds eye conjure the image of an empty corridor.It is long, straight, and narrow.There is only silence and the lights are flickering, offering split seconds of alternating vision and dreaded darkness.His voice carried through the great space and bore them both to the very place of which he spoke.Can you picture it?Ximma nodded.Good.Up ahead you begin to see something move ...in and out of the darkness ...a creature, so utterly terrifying that your blood is frozen ...your heart stone.It races towards you faster than you can flee, carrying with it a shrieking hiss which freezes you in your place.You see it?Ximma nodded.A Human?Ximma nodded.I see.You have now but three choices: to turn and run back down the passage from whence you came, or take one of the unknown paths leading off to either side.Or else you can charge straight ahead at the creature, and hope beyond all hope that it is the Human which flees first.The choice ...is yours alone.Lucasta leaned forward, examining both master and student.The young girl fastened her eyes shut, concentrating.The young boytheir masterdid so too.Smiling gently, he watched her thoughts and the testing choice she now considered, connected in a way few could ever understand.Lucasta, on the other hand, studied the childs cautious expression, her tightly bunched eyes and pursed lips revealing the struggle within in a way which made reading her delicate mind relatively pointless.What is it to be, Ximma?he asked.I ...I would ...Yes?I would  A deafening thud connected with the copper gates.The three reeled around in panic.The chamber lights went out and an agonizing groan signalled that the enormous doors were being torn apart.The groan was followed by distressing yells and roars.The light from outside the room poured in and as the gates melted away one hundred crimson cloaked forms strode through.Peter stood and the old woman rushed over to clutch Ximma in her arms.The surge of cloaked bodies coursed around the room, moving slowly towards them.Then, without warning, Lucasta was thrown into the far tiled wall as though assailed by a titanic freight craft.She collapsed onto the dark slabs, her brittle body numbed with pain, and the child Ximma charged to her side.Peter remained motionless: a young boy surrounded by death.Peter Marx, however, was no child.He may have appeared young in body, but he was older than any who now lived.He raised his arms and the crowd stopped, silent.They watched him intently.You have come here for me, he said.So take me.Lucasta couldnt move from her position, set upon her belly, but she watched a young man step to the fore, dressed in grey, cloaked also in red.He was taller than the others, and she studied how his large eyebrows met in the middle with a most unsettling glare.He gazed down upon her master and smiled.Peter breathed out.Marrak ...Peter, said Marrak.Do not fight us.I dont intend to.Good.Marrak turned and walked from the chamber.Also turning, his own scarlet cloak flowing behind him, Peter left with the assembly.As what was left of the old green copper doors slammed closed, the young girl backed up and the elderly Istron held her close.However, three of the men that had entered the rumination chamber remained.Lucasta stared at them with unmoving, elderly eyes.Faces frozen, they gazed back.A strained sensation fell above them, like a vacant over blanket which sapped all energy and effort.She had never seen her master in such a way; out of the corner of his great mind appeared to bleed a thing she had never seen in him before.Fear.He had left without protest, regardless of the damage this army had done.She had to know where they had gone.She had to find her master.She had to help.Tell me, she said to the three men in her most imposing intonation, is it customary to hold prisoner like this an elderly woman and an innocent child?They each looked to one another, and the closest stepped towards them.The girl may leave, but you must stay.The Istron snorted.We will have the girl.She will be taken somewhere ...safe ...with the rest of the children.He smiled toothily and with a firm hand took hold of Ximmas wrist.But she, the old yet powerful Istron Lucasta, took his as he did so, looked up from the ground, and cried, We are not your enemies!They are.Help us to leave here at once!Wait!yelled one of the other men, reaching for his holstered blaster.Dont go near her!Too late.The Istron released Ximma and whipped out his own weapon, triggered it, and fired.Thump!The black marble floor welcomed the mans warm remains.The other held his arms high in surrender.Good, Lucasta said as she took Ximmas hand and staggered from the room, the now hostage held Istron and his guard courteously holding the warped doors open.In minutes Lucasta and Ximma were rushing swiftly down the pristine white and mazelike corridors of the station Europa.Deep beneath the frozen moon, the Istrons haven had been secret for many years.And Lucasta, whose back now splintered with creasing pain, focused with all her power, penetrating the surrounding structures of the station until the small life sign of Peter Marx materialized before her.As lightning strikes in an instant flash against the darkened sky she saw him.There!Keeping the child behind her she raced along the corridors, until they reached another chamber, closed off on all sides.That was it.As she slipped through an opening of a single side entrance, a formidable voice spoke out.Hold him still!The young boy, Marrak, was only twenty years old; and yet he and Peter were so alike, not only in looks, but in other, more dangerous ways.Peering around the corner, Lucasta looked over the dark red crowd and almost gasped when she saw her master.Covered in his own blood, he hung suspended on the far side of the room, encircled by a dozen more Istrons.Each stood apart, arms reached out to hold him in place.Marrak paced among them, circling Peterhumming, musing, taunting.He stopped.How many children are here, Peter?he asked.How many Istron children live down on these levels?Three thousand six hundred and thirty four, Peter replied.And you chose them all?Every last one of them.Marrak smiled.The children of Europa ...the Istron children ...little echo bearers.They have a song down here, you know?Do you want to hear it?Peter said nothing.No?Well Ill tell it to you ...Deep beneath the moon we lie; cut off from life, now ask us why,  We struggle with the rest you see; cursed, bloody ...not meant to be.Silence filled the crowded chamber.Marrak, Peter said.You  Use my full name!No.Marrak smirked.You fear me?I fear what you plan to do.I fear that which fills your mind.The struggle you are losing with yourself.Remember everything I taught you.Stop this now.Marrak laughed; a long, cold, childlike laugh.So, he said, pacing once again, our people tell me that the golden armies of Titan have at the last overcome dark and molten Crilshar.We all knew it was nothing but a matter of time until the war was over and the Humans stopped fighting amongst themselves ...But, as no one else seems to gather, therein lies our problem, Peter.You have been helping Titan and the Alignment.I know you have.And now there is peace out there, the attention will turn back to us.The hunt that began will now continue.They will come for us.They will find us.And every last one of us will die!Youre wrong!We are safe down here.They will not find us.You dont need to do this.Marrak stopped pacing and stood before him.I am taking the Istrons to war.With or without your help.Help is not what you want from me.Marrak shook his head.The result of your touch gives us our abilities: an echo of your own gift.You are more powerful than all of us combined.Even now you are holding back for fear of harming one of us.I dont want to kill you, but I do want your gift.Peter sighed.A gift is given.It is not taken.So you will give it to me?Peter smiled.No.Wrong!Marrak reached out his arm, pointing his finger.Directly at Lucasta.Her head snapped to the side as though something had connected with her cheek.Ximma screamed and the two were pulled by some hidden force from their hiding place, through the parting crowd, and into the centre of the room.Warm blood dripped down the old womans face.She wiped it aside and stood, slow but defiant.Marrak pulled her toward him as others took hold of the young child.He held Lucastas throat in one hand with throbbing pressure.Peters face burned as red as hers.Marrak, stop!he said, fighting for freedom, unable to move.His captors kept their distance, hands outstretched, holding firm.Then give me your gift!Lucasta, looking down to her blood covered hands, realised her master couldnt surrender his power.Not to this madman.I wont!Then she dies!Marraks fingers tightened around her neck.Her faced burned.The room spun.Stop it!he said Stop!Lucasta shook, raised up so that her feet no longer touched the ground.Her eyes made contact with those of her killer.She raised her hand, brought it up to his face, and gasped, Stop.Marrak let go.She fell to the floor, and said, Free Peter Marx!Your tricks are only as powerful as your quarry will allow!he said, swiping his hand across her face and sending her flying into the crimson crowd.Pushed forward from behind, she slammed into the floor.She looked to Peter.Youre ...right, she said, panting for breath, and she turned to another Istron towering above her.Free Peter Marx!No!Marrak cried, but it was too late.Lucastas puppet had thrown himself at one of the men holding Peter in place.They both fell to the ground.The others turned, distracted, and Peter plummeted from above.Kill him!Marrak screamed in a fury of rage, and the men around him fired their blasters at their old master.Peter stood, and as though an impenetrable wind had suddenly filled the air around him, bright light, bullets, and screaming men and women took to the air all about him.Lucasta, however, did not wait to see what happened.She turned and crawled across the room toward the place Ximma lay, while all about her light and dark collided in a roaring storm.She took Ximmas hand and turned to see Peter fighting back an attack from Marrak himself, who, in an effortless bid to overwhelm him, was now tearing the room apart.If you wont join me, Marrak said over the tumult, and you wont give me your gift, then I will force you to fight!If you have nowhere to hide, your only option is war!Dont punish them, Peter said, averting a dark gust of energy and driving it into the metal structure above.Europa must remain!Marrak forced the ceiling above them to collapse, crying, EUROPA WILL FALL!Lucasta took a deep breath.She picked up Ximma, who held her tight with streaming tears, and moved to find the way out.But before she could, the dark figure of a man blocked her way.He held up a blaster.A bright flash filled her vision.Then a burning pain in her chest.She fell back, dropping the child, and watched the ceiling above collapse inward.Down ...down ...falling ...crushing ...overwhelming ...darkness.* * *  Flashing images saturated Lucastas mind, cold dreams of death and ice.Screams were all she could hear.White flame and her masters voice.Lucasta lay on her front, looking down at dark ice.Colossal shelves folded in on themselves and her home disappeared below.A weeping sounded, and shivers fell down her spine.All was white and black.Lucasta ...Lucasta, wake up!Lucasta looked up.Peters mourning eyes of cold sapphire looked down.He held her in his small, trembling arms.Wh ...What happened?She looked to her blood covered clothing.My chest  You were shot, he said.I managed to heal you as we abandoned the moon.Shot?What ...how ...the others!She gazed around to realise they were inside an escape pod.Above, to the side, and all around, through the clear, crystal like casement, she could see masses of ice collapsing, hurtling down towards them.Its all right, Peter said.Well make it out.But the others ...Peter placed a hand on her shoulder.Marrak destroyed the structure beneath the moon.Lucasta almost stopped breathing.Europas gone?It cant!She paused.Where is everyone?Peter closed his eyes.Tell me they survived.Peter, tell me its not just us!His lip quivered.She looked around.Wheres Ximma?Lucasta I  WHERES XIMMA?!She ...She didnt make it out.You said she would!Well I was wrong.Shes gone, and so has everyone else.I made a choice.I picked you up and ...and ran.A thunderous crunching sound broke upon the escape pod.Peter twisted towards the controls and keyed in a series of commands, before turning back to Lucasta.She tore at her hair, beyond hysterical.Lucasta, listen to me.It was my fault, she whimpered.No.It was mine.Im so sorry.He took her face with both hands.I have to go.Theres no choice now.We have to disappear.Ill stay with you.No!he said.You wont be safenot with me!But there is somewhere you will be.You will travel a small distanceto the greatest moon of Saturnand there upon Titan you will stay, safe but secret.Until you receive my call.We will see each other again, Lucasta.She felt a tear roll down her cheek as she gazed up through the crystal screen.Almost beyond the outer crust of ice.What light there was waned rapidly into the dark of space.I have a close friendship with a family on Titan, he said.The Berenguers are good people.The general and his wife have a young son, Ruben.She looked down.Her home had gone.Lucasta, listen to me!Go to Titan.Join them and watch out for them, especially the boy.I know that with your guidance and teaching there will be hope yet for the Systems.And Humanity.But not for the Istrons, she said.Peter said nothing, and turned back to the controls.I will do as you say.But my thoughts will always be with you ...until that day.Until the day I receive your call.Peter turned back and held out his youthful hand, stroking her dark, furrowed cheek.He smiled sadly.Shed known him all her years, though she had grown old and grey, whilst he, with his night black hair and impenetrable skin of radiant paleness, had not aged a moment.He reached behind his head and removed his necklace; it was silver, bearing a small, dark orb at the chains end.He handed it to his old student.Well then, L ...Lucasta, he said, this is goodbye.B ...But only for now.Take it.This necklace is to be cherished.I was given it a long time ago.It protects the bearer in uncertain odds and holds part of the gift I have carried for many years now.Take it and stay safe.They emerged from the white and blue covered moon, drifting far, the giant form of Jupiter suspended below them.She leaned forward, but Peter shoved her back.A crystal screen shot out between them, splitting the pod in two.This is where we part, he said.No!This is goodbye ...We cant!...but only for now.A jarring thud sent tremors through the craft.Lucasta fell onto her side, shutting her eyes.When she finally found the courage to open them a small gasp left her lungs.And she watched, silently, as the other half of the craft drifted away.Peters palm pressed up against the glass, and she held up hers, watching as he disappeared, far off into the distant, lonely dark.Two      50 YEARS LATER  4262 A. C. E      Infinite streaks of fierce, gusting flame disappeared through the vessels viewing portal, replaced by an eternal canvass of blinking astral bodies.As his grand ship achieved its destination, General Ruben Berenguer surveyed the lone planet aheadshrouded in the violet hued light of three moons.Several days it had taken to reach the planet Rotavar.Several days of serenity coaching, unsavoury nutritional supplements, and the most uncomfortable sleep imaginable.But it would be worth it if he found himself able to complete his task.Gazing at the image displayed on the far wall of the viewing platform, however, the General was not entirely convinced the profits outweighed the perils.Masses of metal rose before him, drifting in unfathomable might and terror.They flowed forward like glistening bodies, the largest of which echoed stars in its mirror like hull.It moved away from the rest; and from the backbone of that foremost, spiked vessel, the enemy watched with unease.The darkness of humankind had ever been greed and fear, and the worlds of each man fell apart that witnessed the terror of they whose ships blocked the way.For they were of the world Crilshar: dwelling place of the dark House of Dishan and its cruel, endless armies.Push through!Ruben told his navigators as he stared into the face of darkness.But General, replied the pilots on the large screen before him, transmitting from the centre of the vessel, they are too strong and too many  I said push through!They hesitated again, glaring at the intimidating sight: black, spear ridden vessels blocking any view of the planet behind.You heard him, yelled Rubens captain, Ernesta Mendoza.Dont you dare slow us down!She nodded to her general and the pilots obeyed.His ship continued.The image on the large screen in front split in two and up flashed the image of a man, his face contorted into a twisted smile.His irises were red, the whites of his eyes not white, but a black deeper than the distant pits of the mining world, Ineri.Black boned shoulders were disturbingly buttressed by pale, skeletal skin.Who dares pass through a blockade of the Dishan?he said with a voice which rattled the walls of the Generals viewing platform.The creatures tone was sharp, vicious, and entirely unforgiving.Ruben knew the planit was his after allbut the count was short.He had no time to waste bartering words with a vulgar Crilshan.You will abstain from hindering the path of this vessel, he said with a resilient authority.This is the Quasar.You have no doubt heard of such a vessel, what it can do, and who commands it.The Crilshan scowled, said nothing to counter.Rigid moments passed before the man replied.You may not pass into the Rotavarian System.Is that so?What my lord commands me is so.Ruben glanced at a nearby screen, charting the positions of the enemy vessels, before staring the envoy deep in the eye.We have you at close range.If you are not prepared to allow us passage then you force me to take your vessel.Nervous faces filled the viewing post.Crew members looked to each other with mounting unease.Captain Mendoza stepped forward, her hand hung inches from the Generals relaxed limb.The Crilshan grimaced again.You yourself will be destroyed!Ruben nodded once.If you knew anything of my ship and my crew you would know that we are willing.But know for sure that you will not survive.I promise.The screen flickered.The Crilshan moved as though debating the threat with nearby commanders.Dark filled the monitor.Nearby Crilshan vessels began to move aside.The enemy stood down.* * *  Ruben Berenguer closed his eyes and sighed.His tall demeanour, the tidy cut of his ashen beard, but above all his general disposition, revealed a man quite obviously well militarised.His slim livery of black and gold was appropriate for a senior commander and a man of his age, and he favoured his uniform over any other attire.Captain Mendoza, on the other hand, was shorter and somewhat muscular.Her dark and gold armour was just as tight fitting, but, as she often reminded Ruben, how else would he catch sight of her voluptuous curves?Having moved from the viewing centre at the front of the ship, the two boarded the Quasars shuttlecraft with a dozen hardened Guard and seated themselves quickly.Burning light soon filled the space all around them.This had better work, he told himself as he listened to the harsh sound of fatigued metal boiling on the outer surface of the craft.Entering the atmosphere of the Accentauriban colony known as Rotavar, to him the exterior threat was of no concern; it was the task at hand which caused him to perspire so furiously.The Crilshan blockades in the Fourth System were growing.But he had dealt with commanders of such low calibre many times before, the very mention of his name or that of his vessel generally enough to discourage most enemies from picking avoidable clashes, even if that meant allowing him through a hostile line of Crilshan barrage vesselsillegal as their blockade was.It was a freedom afforded to very few.Mendoza sighed anxiously beside him and tilted her head back drowsily.Nervous?she asked.Ruben leered at her.Me?No.You?Oh no ...definitely not ...no, no, no.This is exciting.No.What in Titans name is there to be nervous about?He grinned, swiftly wiping away a creeping bead of sweat from his forehead.Now drifting through the uncommonly thick night time clouds of the world, the reality was he felt more than a little uneasy, even if he couldnt reveal it.In due course the misty veil of vapour cleared to reveal a view resembling a cloudless night sky: an enormous, black city boasting a multitude of skyscrapers, shimmering lights emanating brightly from each of them.Peering out of a small porthole he could make out half a dozen cities on the landscape, stretching to the horizon far beyond, each separated by vast, desolate tracts.So this is Rotavar?Mendoza said, shrugging her well built shoulders wearily.I dont like it.* * *  Prickly sweat spilled from every aperture on Rubens body as he marched down an exposed runway.His captain nudged close behind and the elite guard trailed farther back still.Furka!swore Mendoza, trotting up alongside.Its blistering hot!He chuckled.You should see it in the day.The northern cities of Rotavar get a mere point three four discs of rainfall a year.In some areas it takes a decade to fill a single cup.She scoffed.Then why are so many people out here?Dont forget that Rotavar is a third generation colony.Its strategically important to the Samosian Queendom.Evidently not important enough to fight the blockade currently choking it to death, she said.Ruben smiled at her, shaking his head.The sturdy captain had once led a charge of early recruits at a ramshackle legion of Crilshan soldiers, only to find that she was the only one striking.What impressed him most was the fact that Mendoza, having realised she was running alone, continued on.She fought off thirty Crilshans before help arrived, and Ruben promoted her a week later.They had remained close ever since.The point was: although a brave woman, Mendoza could find the energy to moan at the most inconsequential of matters.They both gazed ahead and stopped.As an undeclared rule, trumpets would sound and mighty drums roll to signal their arrival; but this time it was not so.It was the middle of the night and in the furtive silence the Rotavarian Defence Force had assembled to meet their guests and act as escort.So much effort, he thought.So much risk and they really have no idea of the true nature of this visit.Pity.Your coil, sir?asked one of the allied soldiers as they were halted by a line of emerald clad men.The General nodded, taking from his waist strap the traditional blade of his Guard.An electric casting, hard coiled weapon, the coilbolt had been used by his people for centuries.His was unique to his position, and it had always beenor at least for as long as he could remembertradition for the host world to examine and ensure the authenticity of the visitors weapon.There were too many biologically altered impersonators these days; but such a blade, which only worked for whom it was made, could never be replicated.The soldier handed the coil back to Ruben, who ignited it so as to prove his identity.Sparks of sapphire littered the ground and a low hum hung in the late night air.Thank you, General, the soldier said; he bowed and allowed the entourage to carry on down the runway.In the distance a man dashed towards them.He too was dressed in light emerald armour and a dark green coat.Rotavan!he said, out of breath, saluting the two.Ruben returned the salute.Mendoza managed a grunt and a lacklustre wave.Panting, the soldier said, My name is Chief Aleksey Vasily of the Rotavarian Defence Force.If youll permit, we would like to accompany you to your sleeping quarters and see that you settle in.Ruben nodded in agreement, but the chief continued: May I say what an honour it is to be in your presence tonight, sir!No, no, no, the General said.The honour is mine, Chief ...Aleksey Vasily, he repeated, deliberately slow.Okay, greetings are over, Mendoza grunted.Where do we sleep?Chief Vasily led them all down in steady formation.It took twenty or so minutes to reach their destinationjust beside the raised hillside structures that made up the government quarterand being understandably exhausted, they were left to their own devices for what remained of the early morning.The unpleasant sound of Mendozas snoring in the room next door echoed through as Ruben sat upon his bed.He closed his eyes and activated the circular device on the wall beside him.This particular appliance was connected to the transmitter in the centre of the Rotavarian capital, which in turn relayed the transmission to the Quasar, currently in orbit, and from there through each free world in the occupied Systems of humanity.The Crilshan forces had taken control of all orbiting Rotavarian satellites and the blockade had been jammingand continued to preventany communication leaving the colony through all such means.Several minutes passed while he sat in silence.Then without warning the projector, also positioned upon the wall, cast an image into the middle of the room and the beautiful face of his niece was at once smiling before him.Anna, my dear, he said, almost welling up.How are you?Relieved, you silly old man!she said.Ive been waiting by the image link for hours, worried to sickness!Are you there now?Did you pass the blockade?She was sat on her bed in a pale nightgown, her knees tucked tightly into her chest.We passed the blockade.How?she asked.The same way I always pass, my love.Wheres your sister?In her workshop, as usual, she said, sweeping long auburn tresses over her ears.Busy working on her silly pet.Ruben laughed and stole a moment to look upon Annas heart rending face.Guilt flushed through him.Having spent so much of his nieces childhood away among the Systems, fighting and aiding other worlds, he knew there was so much he had missed.Anna hadnt wanted him to go to Rotavar this time either, and he knew he had his priorities very wrong, but he could not refuse an order from the higher power on his home.He did not have a choice.Titan needed him.How will you return?Anna asked.Surely the Crilshans wont let you pass again.If they know what is best for them, they will, he said.What worries me is tomorrow.I dont even like speaking to the mob of hungry politicians we have on Titan, never mind other worlders.Dont be silly, she said.Nothing scares you.I wish that were so.Youll be fine.She smiled.Just speak from your heart.I will.A knock sounded on his bedroom door.Was it time already?He looked back at his nieces image.I wish I could be there with you, she said.Another knock.Ruben stood.So do I, Anna.Focus on your studies at the Institute and soon enough you will be.Soon enough.Three      Ruben stared at a life size image of himself, hovering frozen in the middle of the darkened room.He backed up and sat in his chair, positioned in front of a curved metal desk.On the other side sat a second man, his outline only visible through the diminishing glow from the skylight overhead.The motionless duplicate began to move, and stepped up to a pixelated podium.We have been through much, Rotavar and Titan, spoke Rubens copy.Yet, through all the trials the Four Systems have thrown our way, we have endured ...and more, we have thrived!The sound of cheering and rounds of applause filled the dark room.The image of the General smiled and said, I still remember my first visit to this beautiful world.My father brought me here as a child, and I recall being amazed at the blueness of the sky ...the softness of the sand in the streets.Unfathomable splendour is what called me back here.Another applause of approval.Two thousand years ago man ventured out into the stars, hungry for knowledge and enlightenment.But what they found was war ...and conflict.No peace.The unity now known so far away on Earth is not shared with ustheir colonial friends.But I promise you, it soon will be.Before long, we too will have peace.However, there is much we have all yet to do.Remaining steadfast is one of them.And I refuse to lie to you: hard times are ahead.I am sure you are all aware of the tribulations occurring within the Systemal Alignment at this very moment.I am here today, proudly, to say that no matter how hard times become, Rotavar and Titan will always remain the closest of allies, especially in these times of difficulty.Titan is forever your friend and will always stand by you The image stopped dead.And we know the rest, said the man behind the desk.Prime Minister Edgar Mokrikov leaned forward and touched the table.The window shutters lifted, the lights in the room went on, and the real Ruben Berenguer twisted in his seat, watched the image of himself disappear, and nodded his head.They still eat out of your very palm, Mokrikov said with a smirk.If only I could have them gorge on my words, being prime minister would be much more straightforward.Listen to them, Ruben said, and they just might.Mokrikov laughed, adjusted his long silken suit, cobalt blue.Do you know what they call you here?The Lone General.Tall and kingly.Standing there with his proud bearing and honourable message.We both know the purpose of your visit.To reinforce and improve relations between Titan and Rotavar.Mokrikov shook his head.The real reason?Ruben took a breath.The threat has been realised, Edgar, and it is far worse than any of us previously thought.The High Lord Yux Dishan and his forces beneath Crilshar have gone too far this time.Your people still havent been informed of the blockade currently imposed upon your world?This is true, Mokrikov said.It would do only to increase the instability and cause more panic than our small colony can handle.Understandable in these times.And there is yet no word from the Samosian capital?No word.No help.We will do what we can.Reaching into his desk and pulling out a bottle Mokrikov poured two small glasses of a sickly sweet emerald liquid.The overpowering odour of wormwood was nauseating.The General lay back in his chair, ignoring the glass the old prime minister pushed forward.Its worse than it was fifty years ago when our fathers fought Crilshar.Blockades?Illegal invasions?What next?Its only a matter of time until we discover another deep, dark secret ascending from the caverns of his world!And then it may be too late.The old general, however, was met with an unexpected response.I know the threat, Mokrikov said, knocking back his drop in a single gulp, but to have a strong and united human league once again would be a good thing, surely?Ruben stood up from his seat forcibly.The last time I checked we did, only its known as the Systemal Alignment, not the Dishan Alliance upon Crilshar!The Alignment is not what it once was.Only because we have allowed it to become so.He paced the room rapidly.Bah!said the prime minister.It seems to me that all of this militant thought on Titan has clouded your peoples judgement.What can we do against the power that has emerged from Crilshar these recent years?The last Titan Crilshan war ended in untold deaths.Why are you rushing to meet them in battle again so very soon?Ruben gazed out at the shimmering city of Kondogopas in an attempt to compose himself, but found that the ginger bumblebee attempting to fly through the pane of glass only aided to perturb him more.He had just spoken before the entire government and populace of Rotavar, committing Titan to any cause the Rotavarians embarked upon; and this man would not even consider supporting his.Do you think I want another war?he asked, turning.Dont you?Nobody wants war.Battle and betrayal are but the means for something more.Mokrikov frowned.So what is this something more the Dishan want?Crilshans, he explained, are motivated by the idea, the obsession, presented by unity, by conformity, by perfection.Thats all they want.But its the twisted image of perfection and what they are willing to do to achieve it that makes them so dangerous.Maybe it would be wiser of me to submit, the prime minister mumbled.I have no energy for war.The General closed his eyes.Nothing would be more foolish.Bah!Choose your words carefully, General!I must make the right choice for my people.Not Titan, or for any other worlds!Then make the right choice and do not fall for deception.All they want is a human race of their likeness, and their likeness alone!You may say that, safe in your golden city!Edgar!You know of the horrors Crilshar is capable, but its not only you in the lightning bolts path.All worlds know of Crilshars hatred for my home, their greatest rival for centuries.The House of Dishan has been attempting to infiltrate Titan for decades.And if my home is to fall, mark my words Yux Dishan will make sure the rest will follow!He sat back down and stared at Mokrikov intensely.What are you trying to say, General?Unjust and corruptthat is how I would describe the Dishan regime.And for many generations it has been and will remain, I warn you.Unless we do something.The Lord of Rotavar made no reply, and the General altered his tone.Enough debating!As much as I enjoy it, I am not here for that.As you said, there is another reason for my being here.Go on.I have been sent here, Ruben said, to summon you to a gathering: a meeting of lords and ladies from every single world in the Alignment.The rest deemed trustworthy have been called upon as well.I deliver to you now, in this dark hour, the summons.The summons?Mokrikov gasped.The Baren Igoth?Do not say its name!Both leaned in.We must be careful.The aim of the summons, we hope, was never known to Crilshar.If we are fortunate, it still isnt.The summons ...I know it well.The prime minister fell back, almost collapsing into his chair, the solemn look of concern on his face revealing he truly understood the severity of the situation.And what of the Dishan?What of Crilshar?Are they to have no defence in this trial of yours?We meet to discuss what is to be done on the subject of Crilshar and its leadership.Bringing the problem into a debate for its solution cannot be justified.Give me your support, Edgar, and I assure you it will be no trial.The coming negotiations must be successful.If we go to war, this time I do not think we could win.* * *  So many aspects of the generals stay had been strange this time round; not simply due to the circumstances surrounding the call, but only a day after arriving, Ruben Berenguer was preparing to leave.Edgar Mokrikov would normally meet his visitor and escort them to their shuttlecraft.But this time he did not.After their discussion, Berenguer had offered the prime minister a hesitant and somewhat ill at ease farewell.He knew something was amiss.Mokrikov would be happy when the man from Titan was gone.The prime minister stood on the balcony leading off from his office, his hands clasped behind his back, as he stared out across the city towards the flight strip in the distance.The Titanese shuttle soon lifted off and disappeared from view, the closest sun setting on the horizon a shade of violent crimson.Ruben Berenguer was gone.A black cloud covered Mokrikovs eyes and his mind became grave and distressed as he turned and re entered his sweltering office.Several fans blowing cold air hummed.He pushed a key on his desk and the metal shutters leading onto the outer terrace lowered themselves, sealing the prime minister inside as the lights rose and he paced in the dim glow.CLANG!He froze.CLANG!The lights went off.Darkness filled the room.CLANG!Mokrikov fell to his knees.CLANG!The bell tolled a deep chime a fourth and final time, echoing around the walls while the projector in his desk threw forward the image of a man.He stood disturbingly still.The foot of his black cloak touched the carpet.His face encased in purest silver.The self crowned man had come.Mokrikov attempted to speak but could find no words.The need was soon gone as the deep, distorted, and disturbingly cavernous voice of the figure rattled throughout the room.Edgar Mokrikov, he said.I trust all is well on Rotavar.Yes, y ...yes all is well, he said, a discernible hint of fear evident in his answer.Your meeting with the general from Titan went as planned?You were c ...correct, Cronat, he said.Berenguer does intend to gather the Baren Igoth.Though I suspect he knows that not all is as it should be.Here ...and p ...perhaps elsewhere.The Cronat remained still and altered the severity in his voice.Was it that you gave him such an impression?Have I overestimated your ability to carry out the simplest of tasks?Berenguer is no fool.He is a man not easily misled or broken.Then we must choose a path for him that will lead to inescapable ruin, the cloaked figure said fiercely.It seems Titan alone now stands in our way, and Ruben Berenguer has been an obstacle in my path for too long now.Mokrikov closed his eyes.He couldnt.No more.He looked up at his Cronat and stood slowly; and he surprised even himself with the answer he gave.No.I wont.I simply ...simply cannot betray a friend any longer.The man remained silent, and Mokrikov could sense he was testing him.Beads of sweat seeped down the back of his neck and his pulse raced rapidly as five seconds became ten, fifteen became thirty, until his unnerving voice spoke again.Do not forget that it is I who controls the fleet surrounding your world.It is I who has allowed for supplies to be delivered to your ignorant populace.And yet you will allow none to leave.We cannot keep this blockade a secret much longer.Rotavar will be in turmoil.If it wasnt for me, he snarled, your worthless fleapit would have failed years ago!I ask for no thanks, simply for your friendship and loyalty.But if this is your decision: to betray your Cronat and risk the lives of all those people, so be it!The prime minister felt himself growing in anger, forgetting his fear, and said, The lives of my people were in danger the moment your messengers returned to my doorstep, and every moment since!Ruben Berenguer has forever been a friend, to me and the people of Rotavar.This is my absolute decision.Then the masked man seemed filled with a burning rage.Very well!But know this: you can attempt to hide behind your precious ally and its armies, but it will not save you!I do not try to hide  Soon Titan itself will face the choice all worlds have: to bow to a new power and accept the command of a new union, or be left in utter ruin.No, wait  The old Systemal Alignment is nearing its end!A new power is emerging.The time has come for new leadership in the Systems!And with that the image of the man retreated back into the metal desk, plunging the room into a dull and gloomy afterglow.Mokrikov fell back to his knees, his arms lifeless by his sides.He remained still for some time, unable to move, unable to think.He stood eventually and drifted over to his desk, picked up his quill and paper, and resolved to carve his final confession.He had doomed his people to hell.Four      The die was cast.One single, costly mistake had been made, and the fate of so many decided.All inhabitants of the planet Rotavar watched in horror as the suns light was wiped from their skies, its warmth replaced by a darkness and sorrow that came only with the Crilshan fleet.A dozen vessels approached, circling in orbit, while several more descended in unparalleled strength.One for each city; divided and easily raised to the ground.There was no use in fighting, Edgar Mokrikov knew.They could not oppose such a force and not hope to lose every last man and woman that fought.Ignoring the forceful pounding on his office door he gazed out at the shadows encircling his beloved city, before kneeling down to his personal safe and sluggishly throwing inside his personal papers, a silver backed journal, and his last letter.Then, rummaging through his desk drawer he removed something small.A polished metal.The final solution.He placed it into his pocket.Hope was lost, and it was his fault.Communication with the Cronat had been cut; he was not a man of second chances or of two minds.The die was indeed cast.The hammering halted and as Mokrikov heaved a sigh of relief the door was forced wide open.* * *  Aleksey Vasily stormed into the office, flanked by a dozen emerald soldiers.He gazed up at the shadow of his prime minister, thankful that he was there.He had feared the man had done something foolish.From the look on Mokrikovs face it appeared he had expected to see Crilshan warriors entering his office.In a matter of minutes that will be so, Vasily thought.Prime Minister, the Chief of the Defence Force addressed him.Rotavars defences are online.Every member of the Defence Force is standing by, at arms.Our sister moon is preparing its own resistance, and the government is on its way to the underground safe zones.Your orders?The prime minister made no reply.My lord?I am not your lord anymore!Mokrikov cried.Dont you see?Its over.Crilshar has won!I will not make a decision that will undoubtedly end in more deaths!Vasily took a step forward.But were not alone, sir.Titan will help us.General Berenguer made the pledge not six days past.Send word.He will send help!Mokrikov winced.Titan cannot help us.You do not understand whats really going on here.Death, before long, will take us all ...Titan or no Titan, called a young soldier from the rear of the group, we will fight for our world!Were fighting for our survival, we must engage them!No!said Mokrikov, now so very soberly.I am giving the order for surrender.This is an invasion, not extermination.I do not want this to end with the death of my people.You will surrender and negotiate a settlement, not start a war.Vasily sighed, closing his eyes.That may work for us, but what of our sister moon?What of Manera?The only inhabited moon in the Rotavarian System, Manera, would be targeted just the same, if not worseit held no significance to the invaders.But the prime minister shook his head.Rotavar will be safe, he said, reaching into his pocket.But as leader of this world I have failed.I am of no further use.To you, Rotavar, or our sister colony.I am so, so sorry.Of Manera there is little hope.And as silence fell on the room, darkness covering the horrified city outside, hope descended and the prime minister of Rotavar pulled out of his pocket a pistol, forced it up underneath his chin, and pulled the trigger.Five      BAROOOM!The thundering roar of approaching space vessel engines flooded the ears of Antal Justus as he sprinted through the panic filled streets of the Maneran capital.The howls and cries of men, women, and children were all around him.Death and disaster was everywhere.A fire raged on every corner.But amidst the hopeless scene of a moon in anarchy, the crew of the Crimson Flux stirred with unparalleled excitement.They looked at their monitors and watched the sun disappear from view, replaced by the jagged hulls of impenetrable Crilshan barrages.The planet Rotavar vanished.Overwhelming darkness, which drove any ordinary person mad, little affected the crew.Scenes of war and chaos were nothing new.Theyd seen worlds fight and die before; it happened all too often in the outer systems.But they entire crew understood.The day of reckoning for the people of Manera, moon of Rotavar, had come.Nearly there!Justus called over the tumult into the comm device on his leather covered wrist.Keep close behind!Weve got your back, Captain, came the retort.Dont get all nervous on us now!Justus laughed.You think you know me so well, Kaara!I do know you so well.Watch out for vehicles on you rightnow!He dodged a sharp left and the military convoy which raced around the corner slipped past him with inches to spare.However the Zadian Scramblera fast, one manned motorcycleburned past and knocked him to the ground.Captain, are you all right?Justus swore, jumped back up, and knocked another man from the scrambler now racing past.As the soldier was thrown from the bike, Justus clambered on and sped off.The convoy continued on to the flight strip in the distance.Justus raced across the city, moving as fast as the scrambler would allow.A shadow loomed above.He felt calmer, focusing on reaching his target before the attack came.He looked up to see the metallic underbelly of his craft in the sky.Captain, you dont have much time, Kaara urged him.Relax, he told her.Im two minutes away.You focus on your part, and Ill mine.Passing terrified families, running for their lives, he raced on.Turning the corner and scaling a grassy embankment he stopped dead at a huge wall which obstructed the entrance to the Noble House, home of the Maneran Royal Family.A house now without a military guard.He looked up.The Crilshans were almost there.Kaara!he shouted into his comm, I need a  Before he could finish his request a projectile, fired from above, exploded directly ahead, tearing a section of the twenty foot wall to rubble.He dropped the bike, shielded himself from the blast, and before the black cloud had cleared rushed through, praying no opposition lay in wait.Thanks!he said.You know Ive always got your back.Yes, andblast!Justus stopped to see half a dozen blood thirsty almuits hurtle down from the house towards him.Genetically modified to be the ultimate canine guard, they packed a fatal bite, known to tear limbs apart like paper and controlled by their owners through chips inserted in the frontal lobes of the cerebral cortex.Pulling out two handguns he licked his lips and ran straight at them, firing fiercely but accurately, hitting first the front two almuits and taking out a third in turn.As they reached him he shot one in the head and jumped as high as he could, forcing his left foot to collide with the salivating jaw of another.That one fell, but for the last he wasnt quick enough, and he landed on his back holding the jowls of the beast at bay with both hands.Justus couldnt let go, couldnt feel around for his weapons, and couldnt save himself.The almuit hed booted shook itself awake and charged.But as the young captain weakened, the stampeding canine exploded in a shower of innards and blood, and the one on top howled in pain and tensed up before collapsing dead on top of him.He pushed the beast aside and shot to his feet.A little farther up the hill, waiting at the entrance of the grand house, stood a young girl.No older than sixteen, she clutched a heavy looking red beam rifle; smoke rose from its muzzle and the laser still pointed at Justus chest.The girls hair was as dark red as a setting sun, and the young captain stood still.It was not her he was focused on, however: his hearing, well attuned, had picked up on something else.Over and above the sound of barrage vessels descending towards them, another trembling drone set his heart racing.Initially he thought the Crilshan attack had begun, and he held his breath, but as hundreds of rockets launched from the city in which he now stood, Antal Justus realised time was shorter than hed anticipated.He burst up the hill and took hold of the young girl.He dragged her back inside the grand house as she protested at being denied a view of the astonishing spectacle taking place outside.But upon entering the trembling entrance hall, he couldnt miss the metal bar which hurtled into his field of vision  Smash!* * *  Adra Dimal sat at the helm of the Crimson Flux and looked down at the burning city below.She then turned her attention to the missiles being launched from Manera at the fearsome barrages above.Kaara Mira sat beside, her young face alive with fear and apprehension.We have approaching darts, Dimal!she said.Yeah, I can see that, Dimal shot back.Releasing counter dartsnow!She flicked her long, coiled hair away and swiftly turned the Flux upward facing, using the resulting weight shift to force the ship down with speed.One, two, three ...missed!she said.One, two, three ...missed again.Ha!Hell be okay wont he?Kaara asked.Who?Justus?Kaara nodded.Yes.One, two, thr An ear splitting roar ensued and they were thrown about in their seats.Shit!Dimal said.That was close.Adra?Oh ...err yeahyeah hell be fine.She dodged another several missiles and, manoeuvring around the attack not meant for them, Adra Dimal shirked the bold Maneran counter strike.Get a move on, Antal!Kaara cried.Weve got no time!* * *  Justus swooned.Dazed and clutching the black granite mantelpiece, he gripped his temples.Once again, he said, thank you for that, Lord Veryan!What is it you want?asked a sturdily built man, still pointing the gold tip of his staff in the Captains direction.His red haired wife and daughter cowered behind him.Justus stood tall and stepped forward.My name is Captain Antal Justus of the Crimson Flux!Im here to save you.The lord lowered the staff.You heard our distress signal?I did.Now we  Lord Veryan dropped the metal staff.You came!Thank you, thank you, thank you!And he rushed over to grasp Justus in an unyielding clinch.Akhhh, we didnt think youd come!Justus pushed him away.My lord, he said, there isnt time.We have a matter of minutes to get to the highest point in the house so my ship can pick us up.The battle outside has started!Run!NOW!At once they began to ascend the shaking stairs, Veryans wife and daughter in front as Lord Veryan and Justus followed behind.Youre the captain of a ship?he said.You dont look old enough!Youre just a boy!In actual fact Justus was twenty six.But now wasnt the time to argue the point.Just keep your mouth shut and do as I say, all right?!he shouted, urging them to run faster.Did he just tell me  Oh daddy, do as he says and be quiet!his daughter told him, and she glanced back.Justus smirked and she returned a smile, before turning to run up a hefty flight of stairs.Were on our way, Kaara!he called to his ship.* * *  Understood, Capn!Kaara responded whilst being thrown about the cockpit as yet another volley of rockets was launched from the planet below.Watch out!Im doing my best, darling, Dimal said, with gritted teeth and a feigned smile.They avoided another half dozen missiles.Oops.Kaara spun.Oops?Why oops?Crilshans are returning fire!Dimal said, turning to face her navigator with an expression of pure dread.Were out of time ...* * *  This way!cried young Aron Veryan, now leading her parents and Justus towards the houses tallest tower.Quickly!They ascended a great staircase as a horrifying crack split the steps in two.Justus pulled Aron aside as they were cut off from her parents.They stood petrified on one landing, while the captain and young girl wavered on the other.Go!Veryan told his daughter.Go!Get my child away from here!No, daddy!Is there another way?Justus called.Aye!Its longer but we can make it.Go!Capn!Kaaras voice came through his glove comm.Crilshans are on the offensive.You have less than two minutes.Then come for us immediately!Were on our way!At once they were thrown from their feet as the floor shook.The two scrambled up and Justus dragged Aron back and along cracking corridors, the stone beneath them shaking uncontrollably, causing furniture, displays, and portraits to fall from their places and crash into pieces upon the fracturing floor.Justus carried Aron up a collapsing stairway, forced to dodge the metal and stone falling from the walls and ceiling.I cantI cant!Aron cried.Not without them!Nonsense!He dragged her to the top of the steps.Come on!Were nearly there.We wont leave them!He looked out of the window and gazed across the open courtyard to the tower on the other side.Above the far end of the court hovered an old and battered, darkening red shuttle shipthe Crimson Flux.Its ultimatt engines sent powerful currents of air towards them.Aron pulled herself up from the floor and bounded across the terrace.Justus charged after her.The tall trees in the yard shook chaotically.One toppled over.Justus threw himself on top of Aron, knocking them both out of its path.Antal!called a voice, and he looked up to see Kaara running along the yard towards him.He picked himself and Aron up and the three scurried underneath the craft.The Veryans here yet?No, Captain.Not yet.Come on.But as Kaara reached up for the haulage cable and harness hanging from the Flux, a sound was heard that tore through Justus heart.Complete and utter silence.A darkening wraith passed over them; the dense mass of shadow moved into position.No!he said.We should have had more time!Well we dont, Kaara said, and she began strapping the cable around Aron, who whimpered and cried aloud.Justus watched as bright beams of white light fell from the colossal Crilshan barrages, landing with deafening roars among the cities on all sides.He gazed in horror as the horizon faded blood red, and inhabited cities subsided, the resulting clouds of smoke rising far above in lofty miasmas.He could feel the heat from the blasts and, too late, it dawned on him: nobody on the moon would survive.Without warning, he felt arms reach around his waist and a clip fastened about his middle as Kaara strapped him into the harness with Aron.Whoa, wait!he yelled.You go first!Kaara said nothing, and smiled weakly as he and Aron were raised from the ground.The shaking beneath them grew and the towers nearby fell in on themselves.Cracks flew up and along the courtyard, splitting the Noble House in two.Kaara collapsed to the ground.Nooo!he screamed.GET UP!She managed to get to her feet as the building fell under the force of white hot blasts.The ground Kaara was stood on disintegrated beneath her.But Justus had already unclipped the strap around his middle and, having attached the cable around his belt to the harness, fallen several metres.He reached for her hand, managed to find a loose grip on her sleeve.Gritting his teeth he held on to her with one hand, clinging to the cable with his other.Up above, Aron Veryan screamed, dangling without support as surges of boiling hot air hit them from the nearby impacts.They threw her into the crafts underside.Justus continued to scream, Hold on!Hold on!The Crimson Flux retreated from the building and took to the air as the harness and connected cable were winched up into the open rear port of the ship.Nearly there!he continued to call, straining to cling onto her with tears falling down his face.But it was no use.And Justus knew it.They were almost inside when another heat pulse drove into the rear side of the ship.They lurched askew.All were sent soaring into the hull of the Flux.He managed to hold on to the harness but wasnt strong enough to maintain the clutch he had on Kaara.He couldnt bring himself to utter a single word as she fell from his grasp, her terrified face frozen as she plummeted down, consumed by pure white light.Six      The Quasar had been drifting through a deep, blue ocean for three days.The haunting whines, echoing clicks, and low, sorrowful groans of sea creatureswhales to those who knew their marine biologyresonated in and around the viewing centre where Ruben and Mendoza had for most of the morning been stood.Needless to say, the ship was not actually meandering among the ocean depths, but the portal scene, generated with the single purpose of soothing the crew of the Quasar, performed its function well.The enormous pressure space travel had on the minds and bodies of human beings meant that various methods of serenity coaching were practised.For the last three days it had been the Earths Atlantic Ocean.Thankfully, it was one of many alternatives.If I hear another furkin whale Im going to break something, Captain Ernesta Mendoza said to Ruben as they watched the six strong pod of Blue Whales, enveloped by a substantial school of fish, floating nearby.I think the idea is youre calmer when its on, he replied with a grin.Not more agitated.She drummed her fingers along the counter to her right.Lets just say I prefer the more unconventional methods of easing the tension.Give me a good coilbolt duel any day.You know, you can turn it off if you like, he said.Even while Im here its still your ship.Youre still its captain.Mendoza sighed.Levan, she said to the woman sat nearby.Yes, Captain?Kill the whales.Yes, Captain.Give us some rain, she said.I always liked rain.Several seconds later the placid clatter of pattering rain married the image of a rainstorm on the projection wall.She turned back to the General.So, you were saying?Yes, he said so that only she could hear him.The prime minister ...You think he doesnt trust you.I got the impression there was something he wanted to say, but couldnt find the courage to say it.I should have listened better.Maybe he was attempting to give me subtle hints.Maybe we were being listened to.Maybe  Maybe, she said, your suspicious mind is over active in its old age.Careful, he said, raising an eyebrow.The Quasar is yours, but the crew will lock you down below if I tell them to.Mendoza leaned forward with a smirk, and whispered, Just try it, mister.* * *  The leap, as it was known, was nearing its end.It had taken little less than forty eight hours to pass between Accentaurib (the Fourth System) and the star Accentauria (the Third), as the light years in between were traversed at an unimaginable and previously deemed impossible velocity.From there the Quasar had passed into the Second System of Proxima Centaurihome to the Dishan beneath molten Crilshar.Once the engine had been pushed to full capacity and the ultimate leap generated, the journey back to the System of Sol (the First System) had taken three days more.And now, as they perceived the Veiled Coalsack and broke through the Kuiper and Oort boundaries of Sol, instantaneous bursts like lightningsapphire and striking sunlightsaw it materialise into the silent depths of Saturn space.The orange haze of Titan received the enormous body of the Quasar.In a greatly protected and well armed orbiting station set around Saturns largest moon, the ship was set in an engineless orbit alongside the largest vessels in the Titanese fleet; and in a shuttle the General, the Captain, and their Guard descended once again to the home world.All was silent, peaceful, and calm as Ruben gazed at the might and beauty of their protector, Saturn, her rings of gas and rock circling in perpetual splendour.News of the attack on Rotavar and its moon had reached them as they arrived home.The summary was more than a little disturbing.Such a move by the Dishan family was too self assured, too aggressive.Ruben needed to speak to his guide without delay; she would be able to shed some light on the situation.Passing through the dense clouds of the moon, the shuttle soon came within sight of a large dome, clear and shining, one hundred buildings inside reaching three hundred storeys high.There appeared a great valley before them, running on all sides and surrounding the structures in a protective crater.Beyond rose a grouping of glorious mountains which left part of the valley in shadow, as though a glimmering memory of the warmth of natural light.Upon the farther side of the great dome a larger elliptical structure overshadowed it; and through the blood red haze an enormous dome stood proud at the centre out of which a tall spire rose.Its height could not be guessed by mere sight alone, and countless lights gleamed from within.It was morning.The Twelve Cities of Titan, he said, squeezing tight the captains chair behind which he stood.Welcome home, everyone.The shuttle descended into the first of the Twelve Cities: that which acted as the harbour dome and the great entrance of Titan.And leading up the road their ground vehicle quickly flew; Ruben took deep breaths and felt the cool, wonderful peace of the cities.The red mists glimpsed high up through the crystal like domes felt more like a gentle blanket protecting the populace from sight of their enemies, rather than a veiled cage.They carried on northward, through to the central dome, the buildings becoming grander and rising higher than before.Coming at last to the tallest tower of Titan, out of which the spire ascended into interminable red mists, and to a vast, light marbled courtyard, he found a delegation had gathered to meet them.Furka, Mendoza swore.Thats got to be the entire council out there.Ruben nodded.Some four dozen finely dressed men and women, clad in gowns of white, purple, and gold, waited on the marble forecourt, aside a rounded streaming fountain.He stepped out of the vehicle and was at once surrounded by the bustling group of followers and admirers, all keen to hear news of his diplomatic campaigns, no doubt.Mendoza and four members of the Guard climbed out behind, though nobody rushed to them.Cries and cheers rang out.It was only as Ruben breathed in deeply and felt the light spray of the nearby fountain that he realised how exhausted he really was.At sixty years old, by Titanese law, he should have retired to a more static position within the military, not be off travelling the Systems.Then again, he knew that was most probably the reason he was able to keep going; stopping would only age him further.The General stepped forward and received a slight nod from their leader, Lady Maxim Pinzn, and then what appeared surprisingly to be a fraction of a smile; the hood of her long, purple cloak covered her head and she held her hands clasped in front of her womb.Our general, welcome home!called one of the council women.Come give us word of the outer worlds.News has seldom arrived in as many days as youve been gone.He smiled weakly.Ill quite happily tell you all what you want  How go the lines of defence?asked one.All in good time, he said.What does the Enusti Emperor have to say?Time, lord, time.He looked to Lady Pinzn, who smirked derisively.And the New Dishan Alliance?I have so much to tell you, he said, raising his palms, concerning our colonial friends.I promise to do so, but first I must rest.Some of the assembly protested, others understood, and more appeared purely insulted.But he swore they would receive the news they wanted.A meeting will be called, he said, and I will speak to all our people very soon.A time of unity is upon us; a harmony that I hope will begin here, with our mother Titan.Ruben made his way through the crowd towards the fountain.There his nieces awaited him.Glana, age sixteen, was the younger of the two.She hastened forwards and embraced him tightly, while Anna waited, though she hugged him closer.She did not need to tell him how much she had missed him; her racing heart beat up against him as he held her, and he knew.He was home.Seven      Lady Maxim Pinzn held her breath until she was blue in the face.Give it to me in one, she said as General Berenguer closed the door behind him.She breathed out lengthily and repeated her command, inserting an emphasised General at the end.She knew she was blunt, to the point.She had to be.There was not the time for lukewarm deliberating when the Alignment was in a state of chaos.Spinning on the spot, Maxim positioned herself on her favourite point and looked out of her offices full length window.Titans central council building was known as the Command Dome, due to its own likeness to a dome.High up within the Command Dome is where the two veterans now stood, overlooking the vast city below.Maxims office was spacious and finely furnished a dark burgundy; and though she could have sworn she had told her aide to have the room cleaned thoroughly, she could still smell the conspicuous scent of tobacco.Its not good, Ruben replied.The Lady of Titan lifted her purple head covering and walked to the window.Her rosy curls were pulled around her head to form a tight ball at the back, which stretched the skin of her face painfully taut.Tall and trim, she emerged a particle higher than the weary general.Tell me.He ambled over to the Ladys side, staring out of the enormous window which made up the entire wall.I assume youve been briefed on the invasion of Rotavar and the utter destruction of Manera.Unfortunately, yes.When I heard the news I sent for the Cherished Star to aid them, he said, but the Crilshan armada is so strong they were unable to get close without risk of being overcome.Theyre waiting by for our decision before they move.We have to send help, right away.I fear for the colonys survival.I share your fear, dont doubt it.I say we send three vessels to combat the invasion, he said.And dispatch Captain Ferranti onboard the Stellarstream to lead the counter assault.I am to speak with the Council at midday, she said.Im confident they will agree to your proposal.Now come, tell me of your trip!What did Lord Mokrikov have to say of his summons?The General spent a moment considering his reply.Support is lacking, my lady.The prime minister was much less forthcoming in his cooperation than even I had thought.I admit I suspected possible dealings with the Dishan before Id even heard news of the invasion.I thought as much.A negotiation gone wrong, you feel?Perhaps.But our situation is worsening too.Its clear we will have to lead the campaign against the Dishan Alliance; no other state in the Alignment will dare step forward.And countless worlds have, in the past week alone, either refused or immediately dropped their collaboration, and I suspect have done so under duress of the Dishan.The Council has discussed this to death, she said.What do you suggest we do, General?Stop talking and act.Meet him head on.Push ahead with the Baren Igoth and increase the pressure on Crilshar to cooperate.Its possible that with a great portion of the Alignment united we can force the Dishan Alliance into contraction, or at the very least moderate the antagonism of their leader.And if the pressure doesnt result in them submitting?she asked, sitting down behind her wooden desk.I have to plan for the worst.And right now their movements are filled with nothing but enmity.When was the last time the opposing Crilshan Houses of Halagas or Thimes fled from confrontation?I recall there was a time when they would do anything to sate their blood lust.But now they conceal themselves and refuse to fight.He bowed his head.The last decades have allowed only one power to ascend in Proxima.Truly.And now for the bomb shell, she thought.Sensing something was wrong, Ruben cocked his head and said, What is it, my lady?Something we both feared, she said.Something inevitable.With the autocratic system they now have below Crilshar, it was only a matter of time.The competing Crilshan Houses have submitted to the Dishan, and I believe they have done so because they, and others, know something for certain which we do not.What ever do you mean?Maxim Pinzn clasped her hands, lowered her voice, and leaned forward.There have been rumours, rumblings, secret wittering amongst the Alignment Worlds, but our spies have heard.Tell me, General, have you knowledge of the rumour of Erebus?Ruben folded his arms, leaned back, and sat chewing over the question for almost a minute.Then he said, Some years back our intelligence picked up the rumour of a Grade X weapon named Erebus, but nothing tangible could be found.Many had heard the story.From what I recall they referred to it as the Weapon to Destroy Worlds.Frightening stuff.Only no one had heard anything more than the rumour.Frightening indeed, she said.While you were away I was informed by a senior intelligence director of a report.Just one.This particular package, received from our agent below Crilshar, said, and I quote: Crilshan intelligence points to an encounter with the Weapon X.   What she told him was true ...for the most part.The report did indeed contain such an assertion, but she had received it herself.A so far reliable agent below Crilshar had transmitted the message mere days ago.The agent was hers alone.She did not know his identity, and shared him with no one.Well?she said.Youll need to give me more than that.She shifted in her seat.Dont you see?Not a weapon, the Weapon.I generally make a point of not holding too much stock in theories.However, he said, seemingly able to notice the agitated look present upon her expanded features, such moles are required to report using only that language which is necessary.If this particular mole referred to the weapon, we must assume he meant the Weapon X.  At least until were proven wrong.Do you think it possible the Dishan have discovered its whereabouts?she asked.The very fact that Ruben had to think about the answer told Maxim he did not think so.He massaged the ashen hair on his chin.Let us hope not.He breathed in.Now lets pretend you did not just lie to me.Maxim found herself unable to formulate a response.The Weapon X was classed confidential, he said.Above the sanction of a senior intelligence director.Hellits almost above me.So Ill assume you have told no one else.And youd be wrong.Whom?General Mauldeth.I see.His lips tightened.There existed only two generals on Titan at present.While Ruben oversaw the distribution and running of all foreign operations from abroad, General Slimar Mauldeth remained on Titan and performed much the same job, only with a cosier routine and much deeper pockets.Something of a rivalry had developed between them in the last few years, with Mauldeth disagreeing with Rubens attitude to the established military statutes.As long as it did not stop them doing their jobs, Maxim couldnt give two brain waves.Mauldeth and I have discussed this, she told him.Ill send you the report.Let you get up to speed.There are some noteworthy findings which have led me to only one conclusion: Crilshar has attained the Weapon X.  They have Erebus.Again, let us hope not, he said, standing.Ill do some investigating of my own.I shall let you know what I find, if anything, right away.Certainly, she said without moving.I will expect to see you tomorrow.We need a public statement of some nature.And seeing as youve already promised the people news of the Systems, Ill leave the speaking to you.We both know how much youre loved, and the extent to which you relish any opportunity to preach in public.She grinned mockingly.Ruben smiled, bowed, and left the office, leaving Maxim sat back in her chair.Rocking gently she felt, if less hopeful, at least slightly more amused than when she had entered.Eight      The unrelenting gale struck Anna Berenguer like a jagged sting throbbing through her face.The coarse spray of the sea collided harshly with her skin.She could hear everything, from the powerful waves crashing all around to the rash movements of the figure looming behind.She closed her eyes, held the blade tightly in her grasp.The figure struck  Anna lunged down and forward, and in one swift motion blocked her foes assault, rolling over and bringing her blade around, en route for his naked jugular.Amid the moist ridden haze the strong outline of her attacker appeared to evaporate, and not a second later materialized behind her.Throwing all of his weight into one final assault he forced Anna to the slippery verge of the raised platform, where he wavered.Anna took the opening and drove him back to the slipping pivot of the structure, parrying twice and finally thrusting the tip of her blade up to the mans neck.Another wave broke into the side of the platform, drenching them both in a freezing torrent.Anna lifted the blade higher, slowly pushing it into his neck, a smirk appearing on her soaked, sweating face.Your next move?she asked, confidently.But the face of the man stood opposite had not yielded.He glanced down.Anna followed his gaze, but it was too late; her footing was poor and it proved her undoing.The mans heel stamped down on the open grate upon which she was positioned and the metal flooring underneath fell through.As she dropped he offered his hand to catch her, but in the moment Anna chose not to take hold, and allowed herself to fall into the raging waters below.She took a gasping breath and plunged down deep.Her very core froze, legs kicked wildly beneath her.Very rapidly she realised she was unable to pull herself back up, engulfed completely and sinking.Then, while the cold of the water took hold, Annas eyes widened in shock and the apparition in front of her stopped her fighting for the surface.No!she uttered, releasing a mouthful of panicked gurgles.An enormous sphere of fire floated in the water before her.Utterly black and darker than anything she had ever seen, she looked right into it ...and it looked back.Into her very soul.As it seemed she would never again taste the crisp, quenching air, the water surrounding her disappeared all at once, stealing with it the colossal darkness.Just as quickly as it had appeared, the orbed fire was submerged, and vanished.The water fell beneath her and she plummeted hard, landing with a hurtling thump onto the metallic floor metres below.She lay there, coughing uncontrollably as she fought to breathe, spitting water everywhere.Black boots landed forcefully beside her and she sat up, spluttering.You didnt take my hand!shouted the young man, sheathing his weapon.Dark haired, bronze skinned, and only a couple of years her elder, Jon Deloueste had always been the better fighter.Jon, she pleaded, dont  Why didnt you take my hand?You beat me.Youre stubborn  I lost!Couldve died!Yes, Anna said, standing, but I didnt.She moved closer and hugged him, bringing her lips to his ear.I saw it again!Jon pulled back, holding both her arms.The dark orb?The black fire?She sighed.Yes ...Annie!They both looked up to the training rooms viewing platform, high above.Annie, you lose again?her younger sister taunted.Anna turned back to Jon.Dont mention it to anyone, okay?Well talk about it later.And with that she climbed out of the watery pit, drying her face with a cloth waiting at the top.Out of all the recruits currently training for positions within the Titanese Guard, Anna Berenguer was always lagging.Combat exercises usually ended with her bleeding or else drenched in something cold.Even bladed training like today saw to it that she looked ridiculous.Her best friend, who was not even a Guard in training, could beat her.Annie!Annie!Glana Berenguer came charging down the stairs, as vivacious aged sixteen as she had been at six, a huge smirk appearing on her attractive face.She bore the same olive skin as her older sister, but retained the blonde curls of their late mother.When she saw Jon stood half naked, drying himself off, she blushed and ignored him.I didnt lose, Anna muttered, mopping her own long hair.Oh, yes?Glana pulled a face and made a shaming impersonation of her big sister.Oh, shut up!she said, punching Jon on the shoulder for laughing.What is it you wanted?Glana grinned.She wants to see you after classes.Furka!Anna swore loudly.Who?Jon asked.Callista?You really dont like her, do you?Glana giggled.No ...well, yes, I hardly enjoy my sessions with her.Then whats wrong?Its my class!Im late!Again?Glana giggled, shooting Jon a quick, timid look, before sprinting back up the steps.Anna went to follow but Jon seized her arm.Listen, he said.I think you should tell someone about the visions ...about the dreams.Who?Your uncle?He barely has time to see me as it is, she said.He doesnt have time for silly nightmares.So theyre not horrifying anymore?he asked, sardonically.What about her?Callista?Shed want to know, especially seeing as its all been getting worse lately.He was right: it had been getting worse.Anna had considered telling her guide about the terrifying orb; she told her about the other things she saw.But the orb was different.The things she normally saw passed by and more often than not she forgot about them in a day or two.But the orb.It was like it stared back, as though she was not meant to see it.Anna?Ill think about it, she said.He looked at her incredulously.Ill think about it!She could tell he knew thats the best he would get for the time being, and he allowed her to let her dash off and get changed for class.Nine      Central Citys outskirts held many secrets.Only one mattered to Ruben Berenguer.Butterflies danced about his stomach as he walked along a silent corridor.At its end lay a dark, dusty room.This dark, dusty room smelled, looked, and even tasted rotten.She would have it no other way.Ruben placed his hand upon the edge and poked his nose through a slight opening in the door, to be met with the stomach turning, intolerable tang of scented spices.Thwack!He cringed in pain as a thin, wooden cane came into contact with his knuckles.The door swung open.Thwack!struck the cane a second time.Ouch!Thought youd sneak up on an old woman, ey?came a croaky voice.I wasnt  Thwack!Ouch.Stop it.Oh, shush!the inhabitant shot back as he entered.You always were a complainer!Your beatings had a way of revealing that side of me, he mumbled, massaging his hand.But never ridding you of it!The old woman pursed her lips into a taunting smirk.The General entered to find that the room was, as usual, filled with the normal indistinguishable clutter Callista Berenguer kept in her stale and dusty bedsit.The windows were closed off, not allowing even a hint of light into the undersized space, which was instead lit by at least two dozen wax candles.Her scents meant it burned to breathe.Callista stood watching him, leaning breathlessly on her cane.The General recognised the glance and acknowledged her own introduction.He closed the door and held out a large, egg shaped stool for her to perch herself on.Callista dropped down into the stool before it was even beneath her, causing Ruben to rapidly pull it into position.She threw the cane she had held high into the air behind her, barely caring that it landed in amongst a pile of valuable looking pottery.It hardly mattered; the room itself was chaotic and cluttered, full of old memorabilia and throwaway debris.Sharply, Callista turned to Ruben; her eyes dimmed and he could feel her pupils studying him squarely.He tugged down his gold pleated pockets, standing tall and sudden with his feet together as though he were on inspection.No one else could make him act or feel like a ten year old boy again.Not getting any younger himself, he had no idea what age the wise old woman must have been.Pushing one hundred and twenty at least, he thought.He wasnt sure even she knew.With leathery, dark skin and carelessly uncombed fuzz resembling something long dead, the old woman, it seemed, had given up on her appearance.After a few moments the General relaxed.Howve you kept?How was your trip?she asked, ignoring his question.He wet his lips with his tongue.Enlightening.Disappointing.
