Ill be the last one in.Both Ajax and Ethan hit the operation lever inside their pods.A moment later the pods sealed and they both immediately fell asleep.An explosion rang out which was followed by two additional blasts.Within moments the artificial gravity dissipated inside the shipping container.Michael lost his footing and was floating in zero gravity as the container was sucked out into space through the gaping hole in the side of the space station.He half expected the shipping container to decompress as it drifted away, but the door seal maintained its integrity.Sara, pull us in with the gravitational harpoon.Captain, how will I get you on board the Out Drifter?I cant open the shipping container in space  Yes you can, said Michael.We will be contained in vacuum proof sleeping pods.Program one of the Out Drifters external bots to open the container.When we float out you can pick each of us up with the external robotic arm and load us into the airlock.Its a crazy plan, Captain, but I think it will work       TWO      Ivans body was lying on the workshop table in the cargo bay.It had taken several hours to locate him floating in space after he had been sucked out along with everything else in the space stations storage hold.The lasers had destroyed his internal battery and damaged a large part of his hydraulic motor.Michael brought a power cord and connected it to the power outlet which was hanging out of his chest.Ivan instantly opened his eyes.Captain, I have sustained severe damage to my battery and my alternator will need to be replaced.Im glad you are still alive, said Michael.Technically, most people would say I am not alive, Captain.What Im really trying to say is that I am glad your processing unit and memory circuits are operational.I comprehend your meaning, Captain.Sara walked into the cargo bay.Were travelling at interstellar speed and should arrive at Timber 5 in eight days, but we still have nothing to sell to the scrappers, she said.We have to change course for Zeno Par, said Michael.Zeno Par, repeated Sara, her eyes narrowing.That would take us through the alien battle zone.We could go the long way around, but we probably wouldnt have enough fuel to make it back to Timber 5.The reactor fuel level is below thirty percent.The aliens wont be able to intercept us if we are travelling at interstellar speed.Dont bet on it, she said soberly.I was once in a battle convoy of thirty ships travelling through alien controlled space.We thought there was no way they could stop us, but they used a sophisticated gravitational technology to draw some of our ships out of interstellar speed.They destroyed those ships before we even knew what was happening.Its a risk we have to take, he said.Why Zeno Par?she asked.Theres someone I need to find.I thought we were a salvage crew, not bounty hunters, she said, crossing her arms.Im not after a bounty, he said.Then what are you after?Michael didnt answer.Captain, I dont know about this idea.Weve already been out in space for five weeks, and we still have nothing.I will compensate the crew.Thats very kind of you, but you know we wont take your money.Listen, Sara, I dont expect you to come all the way out to Zeno Par without being paid.**  A few hours later the crew were sitting in the living room which was a small area situated in the midsection of the ship.There was a central metal table which was surrounded by mismatched chairs and comfortable couches.Im still in shock, Cap.I cant believe you managed to get us out of that mess, said Ajax as he swigged back on a bottle of Blue Obliteration, which was a chemically enhanced alcoholic beverage.The slogan on the bottle read: Guaranteed obliteration of your blues.We were lucky, said Ethan.No, it wasnt luck; it was Caps quick thinking, said Ajax.He took another swig.So, Cap, why are you taking us out to Zeno Par?There is someone I have to find.Someone?questioned Ajax.He once lived in the Epherian Empire.Was he cast out of the empire like you?asked Sara.Yes, he is living in exile.I have been searching for him for many years.I knew he was somewhere in the outer regions of the galaxy.I didnt think I would ever find him.There are five hundred and eleven civilised planets and thousands of smaller colonies in the Outer Worlds.I was searching for one man among trillions.Why is he important?asked Ethan.Michael cast his eyes down for a moment before answering.The name he uses in exile is Acacius Trifon.It would not be right for me to attempt to explain why I must find him at this time; nevertheless, when we find him you will see why he is important.Until then I will ask you to trust me.This mission is essential.All right, Cap, if you say so, said Ajax.We have to stop at space station X5126 to replenish the oxygen tanks and repair Ivan, said Sara.After the stopover we will take a course through the alien battle zone to Zeno Par.The alien battle zone, said Ajax, shaking his head.That doesnt sound like a good idea.We dont have enough fuel to go the long way around, and they dont do reactor replenishments on X5126, said Michael.We might be able to replenish the reactor at Zeno Par, but we wont know until we arrive.To be sure, we have to cut a path through the alien battle zone to make it back to Timber 5 before we deplete the reactor.Nasty.This plan looks like impatience to me, said Ajax, his eyes darting back to Michael.We should turn the ship back to Timber 5 and go looking for your friend after refuelling.We cant delay this mission, said Michael.I scanned the news signals on the open information networks.I gathered all the information I could about Zeno Par.Reports are circulating that the aliens are about to invade the Zeno Par System.We have to find Acacius Trifon before they do.**  It was a two day journey to the space station X5126 travelling at interstellar speed.X5126 was situated in an area just outside alien controlled space.The station was an old trading outpost that once belonged to the Trade Guild.The Trade Guild later sold it to the Precious Elements Alliance who had recently given up on the station due to its close proximity to the alien controlled space.X5126 was now owned by a group of shady individuals.It was considered a lawless outpost, and not many people would choose to go there unless they could hold their own in a gunfight.Captain Michael was sitting in the co pilots seat in the control room as Sara guided the Out Drifter toward the massive space station.Ajax was standing at the door and watching on as the ship approached.The station gradually became visible through the viewing panel.X5126 looked like a gigantic rectangular block; it was at least two kilometres in length and about seven hundred metres in width and floating in a close orbit around a small red dwarf star called Ambrose 80.We have clearance to land in docking bay 28, said Sara.A series of large docking bay space doors were located about half way along the mid section of the station.Some of them were big enough for larger cruisers to dock, but most of the bays were for small transports and single pilot spacecraft.Larger ships would have to connect to the station using an extendable corridor with a security door affixed to one side; such corridors were known as extender arms.Sara glided the Out Drifter toward the docking bay.The ship slowly drifted through the directed artificial gravity field.Directed gravitational fields were used throughout the galaxy to prevent a pressurised atmosphere escaping into space.The Out Drifter entered one of the largest docking bays and three strobe lights indicated their landing site on the steel platform.Sara brought the ship gently down and powered off the reactor.Michael, Sara and Ajax then walked back to the cargo bay.Ethan had placed Ivans body on a hover trolley.All right, lets say hello to X5126.Be careful; this station has a bad reputation, said Michael.Remember theres no law here.He slung his rifle over his shoulder.Ajax; I want you to buy the supplies.Ethan and Sara; the two of you can replenish the oxygen tanks and life support systems.Ill go and find someone who can work on Ivan.Well meet later at one of the local saloons before we leave.Be careful, Captain, said Sara.Dont worry about me; I can look after myself, he said with a wry smile.Michael pushed the trolley through the exit door and stepped onto the platform.The rest of the crew followed after him.He was instantly met by a bulky man with a bald head and a deeply lined face.The man cleared his throat before speaking.Welcome to our space station, he said.My name is Budo.Im the owner of this docking platform.Michael stared into Budos muddy eyes and wondered what he could possibly want.Did you receive our transfer of guild credits?Yes, yes, said Budo with a sly grin and cold eyes.I received your payment for the first twelve hours.I wanted to explain our terms before you enter the station.What terms?asked Sara sharply.If youre not back within twelve hours we will confiscate your ship.Whats this rubbish youre talking about?asked Ajax gruffly.Its our policy, said Budo.Your ship is ours if you dont leave within twelve hours.You can, of course, pay for an extension; however, such extensions must be paid in full before your time is up.Your rates are nothing short of robbery!snapped Sara.Budo shook his head and sniggered.You are welcome to leave if you think you can find a lower price on another platform.Well be back in less than twelve hours, said Michael as he pushed the trolley around Budo.Ethan sealed the Out Drifters exit door and switched on the triple quantum encryption lock and the automatic security system.The crew then crossed the platform and arrived at the service elevator doors.Generally elevators could take them anywhere within the space station.Michael pushed the trolley into one of the elevators.Ill contact you after Ivan is repaired, he said to the crew as the elevator doors slid shut.WELCOME TO ELEVATOR 57, said a robotic monotone voice from the control console.WHERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO GO?Elevator, take me to someone who repairs androids.THERE ARE NINE POSSIBILITIES.Who gets the worst reviews?THOMPSON VEGA, LEVEL 114, APARTMENT 331  Take me there.WOULDNT YOU PREFER SUNORDER CAVA CORPORATION?THEY HAVE REMARKABLE REVIEWS AND OFFER THE HIGHEST QUALITY SERVICE  Are they paying you to say that?He waited for an answer, but the elevator didnt reply.I thought so.Take me to Thompson Vega.REQUEST ACCEPTED.PLEASE TRANSFER TWO TRADE GUILD CREDITS.Michael took his Guild Credit Transfer Device (commonly known as a GCTD) from his belt bag.The GCTD was a small handheld device with a glowing sensory keypad.Such devices were very common throughout the entire galaxy and almost everyone carried a GCTD.The Trade Guild credit was the universally accepted galactic currency because the Trade Guild had been endorsed by the Epherian Empire.The Trade Guild had been in the currency business since the time shortly after the arrival of humanity in the Triangulum Galaxy.GCTDs were also impossible to hack and once they were assigned to an individual they could never be transferred to another person.There were no confirmed incidents of anyone being able to break the encryption of a GCTD.The Trade Guild had been at the forefront of computer technology for centuries.The guilds encryption technology was extremely advanced.A common myth which circulated throughout the galaxy was that part of the GCTD actually existed in a different spacial dimension, so any attempt to reverse engineer the GCTD was bound to fail unless the means to access extra spacial dimensions was also available to the engineer.Knowledge of extradimensional technology was beyond the capability of most electronic engineers.The GCTD beeped and two credits were instantly transferred.The elevator began to move, and twenty seconds later the door slid open.Directly ahead was the entrance to Sunorder Cava Corporation.Michael sighed and shook his head.Elevator, what are you doing?I told you to take me to Thompson Vega.I AM NOT PROGRAMMED TO ACCEPT ILLOGICAL REQUESTS, said the elevator.You mean that youre programmed to take me where I dont want to go, or rather, where your owner will be paid a commission.Michael drew his plasma pistol and pointed it at the elevators control console.I dont want to have to ask again.Take me to Thompson Vega or I will take my two credits value out of you.REQUEST ACCEPTED.The door slid shut.About ten seconds later the door reopened.Michael looked out on a very long and dim corridor.For a moment he had second thoughts.Only a handful of fluorescent lights lit the corridor and half the lights were flickering.LEVEL 114 AS REQUESTED.Michael nodded and pushed the hover trolley out into the corridor.The elevator door closed behind him.He walked forward into the gloom.Solid steel apartment doors lined the way.He continued along until he reached door 331.A small panel on the apartment door read: Thompson Vega, Robotic and Synthetic Organisms, Construction and Repair.He looked around for a doorbell or console; there was a speaker, but there didnt seem to be a doorbell.Looks like Ill have to knock, he muttered under his breath as he reached out.A small hatch opened at the top and a thin tentacle with a synthetic eye looked down at him.He drew his plasma pistol and the eye quickly retreated inside and the hatch closed.Does your android need repairs?asked a voice from the speaker.Yes, answered Michael.What was the eye on the tentacle all about?Oh, thats just one of my projects; dont be concerned.You can bring your android inside for me to have a closer look said the voice.An instant later the apartment door slid open.Standing directly inside was a short old man with long white hair and spectacles with crimson lenses.In one hand he was carrying a metal pot and the tentacle with the eye was curled up inside.In the other hand he was holding a screen that was a picture of what the eye was seeing.My name is Thompson Vega.I specialise in the construction of synthetic organisms.Im Captain Michael Cornelius of the Out Drifter, said Michael.Thats a scary looking thing you have there.This is probably my best invention to date.Its made using a programmable silicone base overlying a micro carbon skeleton with a replicating nano bot matrix.The nano bots give this one the ability to grow and develop.Thompson looked down at the synthetic organism; his eyes were twinkling with pride.I have no idea what youre talking about; how can a synthetic organism grow?asked Michael.The technology is advancing at a rapid rate and entering a new era of development.Self replicating synthetic organisms will soon be the norm.It really is a fascinating time to be working in the field.Please, follow me.Thompson Vega turned around and walked into the apartment.Michael scanned the dark and dingy room.The entire apartment was crawling with bizarre synthetic creatures and other more conventional droids.There was a giant robotic ant, which was about a metre in length.It was walking in circles around the apartment.There were several massive synthetic spiders on the walls, and a large dog was sitting in the corner of the room.The dog was staring at him with glaring, dark eyes.Michael had only seen a few dogs in his life and this one was by far the largest he had ever seen.It had thick black fur, ears that pointed sharply upward, and an oversized jaw.Is the dog real?asked Michael.No.Dog Two is an advanced synthetic battle droid.About three years ago a customer came here and asked me to construct a synthetic dog that could endure severe battlefield conditions.He paid up front, but he never returned.Why do you call him Dog Two?Dog One was my first attempt.Unfortunately Dog One tried to kill me, so I had to start again from scratch.Thankfully Dog Two is more stable than his predecessor.I have programmed him to be as loyal as he is savage, yet he has been sitting in the same position for the last twelve months.I think his loyalty programming is competing with his battlefield programming and creating a state of perpetual stagnation.He wont let me near enough to check what the actual problem is.Michael stared at Dog Two for a moment.The dog bared its fangs at him and its nostrils flared.He likes you, said Thompson.He looks like he wants to eat me, said Michael nervously.Thompson laughed, which sounded more like a mad cackle.Dont be ridiculous.Synthetic organisms cannot eat.He leaned over the trolley and looked down at Ivans body for a few moments.He then examined him with a handheld scanner.I can have your android fixed in twenty minutes.How much do you charge?Nineteen hundred credits for a full restoration.Michael groaned and shook his head.Are you joking?Thompsons eyes narrowed and he laughed anxiously.Actually, my price is reasonable.I was hoping to pay less than a thousand.Hmm, I could do a basic repair for a thousand, but I cant give you any guarantees.It would only be a patch job.He definitely needs a new hydraulic motor; the cheapest one available is four hundred and ninety nine credits.I will then have to restore his internal wiring, and I can get away with using inferior components.His battery terminals are cooked; I can use generic terminals, but he wont operate on full power, and he will be vulnerable in high stress environments.I will also have to rebuild his synthetic tissue and replace his missing arm; I would have to use low grade silicone fibre.He also has some radiation damage to his inner circuit boards and his processing unit.I dont have to replace them, but he just might display some unusual behaviour.The job can be done on the cheap, but if he starts falling to pieces then it has nothing to do with me.Michael knew it was probably the best price he would be able to find on the station.His GCTD account was dwindling down toward nothing, and the fact that he still had to pay his crew as he had promised was at the forefront of his mind.Near enough is good enough, he said.Agreed, please take a seat, said Thompson as he drew the trolley through a door into another room.I will return in twenty minutes with your repaired android.There were two metal chairs in the centre of the room.He sat down on the one furthest away from the spiders; he had always been a little afraid of spiders.Dog Two was still snarling at him; however, the synthetic K9 hadnt made the slightest move from his place in the corner.Michael was ready to turn his rifle on the android dog if it attacked.He sat still and waited patiently in the bizarre apartment for twenty minutes, and the eeriness was more than a little disconcerting.Thompson returned exactly on time, and Ivan followed him into the room.Captain, thank you for paying for my repairs, said Ivan in his monotone voice.Its a pleasure, Ivan, replied Michael.For an extra hundred credits I can update his voice program.You must grow tired of that dull monotone.No, I like his voice the way it is.Ive had to listen to his voice for nearly three years, and Im used to it.Thompson nodded as he reached for his GCTD.That will be one thousand credits.Michael lifted his own GCTD and transferred the one thousand across, which was a wireless transaction between the two devices.All right, Ivan, lets get out of here, he said as he turned for the door.They both walked toward the exit.Dog Two stood up and followed them across the room.Thompson Vegas brow deeply furrowed.No, you cant go with him.He isnt the one who ordered you!Dog Two whipped his head around and bared his large teeth.Thompson took several steps back as the dog started barking at him.Meanwhile Michael and Ivan watched on from where they were standing beside the door.How dare you bark at me?I made you!You have to do what I say; its in your programming!shouted Thompson.Dog Two snarled.You better return to your corner or I will be forced to remove your batteries!Dog Two backed away from Thompson and sat down beside Michael and stopped barking immediately.Thompson scratched his chin and pondered the situation.He eventually shrugged his shoulders.It seems that his loyalty program has started operating.Unfortunately, for some unknown reason he has made you the prime focus of the program.I dont think Ill be able to deactivate him without a fight, and even if I could I would have to completely remove his internal circuits and start again.I simply dont have the time for such nonsense.Im afraid Dog Two will have to go with you.I cant afford to buy him, said Michael as he glanced down at the large dog.Dog Two was looking up at him with glowing eyes, and his tail was wagging.Consider him a gift.Ive never owned a dog before, said Michael in a low voice, feeling unsure as to whether he should accept the offer.Hes technically not a dog.Hes highly capable synthetic organism; nevertheless, his programming is designed to make him think and act like a dog.Well, all right then; I guess I will take him.Thompson nodded.I am sure he will be a valuable asset.Michael gave a curt nod as he walked out of the apartment.Ivan and Dog Two followed.They proceeded back toward the elevator door.He lifted his wrist com.Hey crew; Ivan is fixed.Ill find a place for us to meet up before we set out.Yo, Cap, I found a bar down on level fourteen said Ajax.Its called The Waiting Saloon; just the kind of place we like  Did everyone hear that?Lets all meet at The Waiting Saloon.THREE      Ajax lifted a glass of red glowing liquid to his mouth.The Waiting Saloon was a dark and rather dank bar that was lit by dull fluorescent light with a green tinge.The place was a hub for crews and was situated close to the docking bays.There were about fifteen metal tables and a central bar where a heavyset barkeeper with a tattooed bald head was serving drinks.The crew of the Out Drifter were seated around a table in the corner of the room.They say Savage Slap will turn your skin red if you drink too much, said Sara to Ajax.Sara generally considered drinking an unnecessary distraction, and she frequently argued that Ajax was being irresponsible, especially if she found him drinking before a mission.Her strict military background had kept her from such indulgences, and her home world culture had generally frowned on the consumption of alcohol.Ajax gave a wide grin.I try to balance it out with Purple Incineration.I have been told that if you drink as much Purple Incineration your skin doesnt change colour, and so far Ive been fine, he said as he checked the back of his hand for any discolouration.You could always simply stop drinking Savage Slap, or you could give up drinking altogether, she said.Ha, I dont think you would like me much if I gave up.I get stir crazy without a drink, he said, grinning.Do you think you could even make such a choice if you wanted to?she asked.Sure I could, but why would I bother?he answered in a low voice.Maybe because you are putting the crew at risk.Thats ridiculous!he grumbled.What do you think, Cap?Michael sipped at his synthetic coffee and glanced across the table at Ajax.He shook his head.I dont have an opinion.You mean that you dont think theres a problem?asked Ajax.Michael didnt answer.Ill tell you what, Sara, if Cap asks me to stop drinking Ill stop drinking.In that moment a young woman approached the table.She looked to be in her early twenties.She had shoulder length black hair, and her eyes were large and dark.Her pale skin appeared as if it had never been exposed to natural light.Pale skin was a common trait of people who lived for long periods on space stations.She was wearing a full length black cloak, and she had an Epherian plasma pistol latched to her belt.My name is Cynthia; I want to join your crew, she announced in a confident and commanding voice.Ajax laughed as if she had told a joke.We dont need anyone like you, and were not advertising for any new crew, especially not a station girl.I can match any of you in a fight.Just give me a chance.Ill prove myself.Forget it, honey, said Ajax gruffly.Dont call me honey, she said coolly, staring down at him with a stony face and a fierce look in her dark eyes.Maybe you should call the police, replied Ajax, chuckling.Cynthia reached for her pistol.She drew her gun and pointed it directly at Ajaxs head.His face hardened, and he glared up at her without moving.She gave a victorious grin.You see; you didnt even have a chance to draw.She lifted her chin proudly.I didnt bother, he said, casually sipping his Savage Slap.You know if you kill me that my crew will finish you off.You wouldnt survive a second if you pulled that trigger.I knew that when I saw you reach for your pistol.Dog Two snarled up at Cynthia and her hand began trembling.You better put your gun away, said Michael calmly.Cynthia returned the pistol to its holster.Her eyes nervously shifted from left to right; she then turned to leave, hanging her head low as she walked away.Wait, Cynthia.What could you bring to our crew?asked Michael.Cap, you cant be serious, said Ajax, leaning back in his chair and folding his arms across his chest.Let her answer the question.Cynthia turned back around and stared blankly at Michael for a few seconds before answering.Well, like I said, Im a fighter.Im sharp with my pistol, and Im not afraid of anything.You can send me into any situation, and I wont buckle under the pressure.Youre really not afraid of anything?asked Michael.Nothing at all, Captain.I have nothing to lose, so I have nothing to be afraid of.If you are really not afraid of anything then you wont mind telling us the real reason you want to join my crew, said Michael.Cynthia lowered her eyes, and a few moments passed in silence.Thats what I thought.Im sorry, Cynthia, we dont have any room for you on our ship.Wait, wait; just give me a second.The real reason; Ill tell you, she stammered.The real reason is because Im stuck on this space station.X5126 is the worst place in the galaxy; just take a look around; theres nothing here but shadows and misery.They say the aliens are coming.I dont have any money, I dont have a family, and nobody has any friends in a backwater like this.If I cant find a crew Ill die when the aliens sweep through and destroy this place.Were not running a charity, grumbled Ajax.I dont want your charity.I just want a chance to prove myself, nothing more.Michael stared up at Cynthia for a long moment and wondered if he should give her a chance.He knew what it felt like to be trapped, and he felt sorry for Cynthia; nevertheless, a lot of people were in the same situation.There were billions of people trying to escape the advance of the aliens across the galaxy.He knew the life of a station girl wasnt one to be proud of.Life on a space station like X5126 was one of hunger and hopelessness.He could fully understand why she wanted to join his crew.She stared at the crew with hopeful eyes.Ill give you one mission and then it goes to a crew vote.We will drop you off at the next civilised stop if anyone votes against you.You have to prove yourself as you said you would.Do you understand?Cynthias eyes lit up and she looked as surprised as she was happy.I wont let you down, she said enthusiastically.Take a seat.Ill introduce you.This is Ajax; hes our heavy gunner.Sara is our pilot.Ivan is an android, but you better treat him like he isnt a robot; and this is Ethan, hes our mechanical engineer.Dog Two barked at Michael.Oh, I nearly forgot; this is Dog Two.**  The Out Drifter powered away from X5126.Michael was sitting beside Sara in the co pilot seat.He stared through the viewing panel at the faint stars in the distance.Captain, Im plotting a course through the alien battle zone to Zeno Par.I hope we dont regret this decision.We wont.She hit the ships internal communicator.Ethan.How is everything looking in the engine room?All systems are functioning reasonably.The engines are at eighty five percent and increasing.The pressure release valves are stable  The pressure release valves almost overloaded on a previous mission, which would have destroyed the entire ship.When Michael had upgraded the engine he hadnt upgraded the release valves, which meant that they were frequently at risk of exploding due to the large increase in pressure.Ethan had welded several reinforced alloy sheets over the valve casings, but they all knew that it was a patch job that could not last.Michael felt a fair degree of anxiety each time they switched to the interstellar engine, which required the reactor to be at full power.We are almost ready for interstellar speed, Captain.Ive plotted the course.Twelve days to destination.Lets do it.Switching engines now.The underlying two dimensional field is distorting.Im developing the curve in three dimensional space.We have a stable trajectory.Here we go.Sara turned on the internal communicator.Be ready for the gravitational adjustment.She reached forward and hit the four interstellar engine acceleration switches and pulled the operational lever fully back.The ship started to tremble and lurched forward as three dimensional space began to curve under the influence of the interstellar engine.The curvature of space created what was commonly known as the sliding influence, where a ship would slide down the angle of distorted space.The speed was directly proportional to the size of the distortion.An interstellar engine allowed ships to reach speeds many thousands of times faster than the speed of light.For a few moments the artificial gravity dissolved, and Michael felt a queasy feeling in his stomach.Seconds later the artificial gravity adjusted to the new speed and everything returned to normal.the valve casings are heating up said Ethan over the com.Will they hold?asked Michael nervously.They will probably settle in the next few minutes.Captain, we need to replace these valves when we return to Timber 5.This is totally unsafe.The entire ship is at risk of falling apart at any moment  Were safely in the slide, Captain, said Sara.The computer will guide us all the way to Zeno Par on autopilot.Ive left the salvage scanners on; we still need to turn a profit.Michael nodded.Well done, Sara, he said as he stood up and walked toward the back of the ship.Ajax and Cynthia were standing in the corridor at the door of the armoury.Ajax was showing Cynthia an Epherian modified automatic cannon, which was an oversized gun that would usually be fixed to a tripod due to its weight.The auto cannon fired explosive micro droids.The miniature robots could adjust their own course in mid flight.If they missed their target they would land and use their six on board robotic legs to either return to the auto cannon to be refired or seek out the original target overland.You would want a weapon like this with you if you ever got caught out in the open, especially in a firefight with aliens.he said, clearly trying to impress her.Its probably too heavy for someone of your size and weight.Have you ever fought aliens?asked Cynthia.Just once he mumbled.He hasnt fought any aliens whilst hes been on my crew, said Michael as he walked by.Ajax nodded curtly.Thats right.We try to avoid confrontations with them, but we have to be ready just in case they decide to show their ugly faces.Michael continued back to the cargo bay.Ivan was sitting in the corner of the cargo bay and working on repairing a broken jetpack.The jetpack had been in Michaels possession since his early days of salvaging, and he had once used it extensively, especially whilst surveying wrecks on surface missions.He had found the jetpack whilst searching a derelict battleship; it was highly advanced, with duel auto adjustable rockets, a programmable advanced computer with autopilot, a return to mothership switch and highly sensitive balance sensors.Ivan had been working on fixing the jetpack since the day it stopped working, but he hadnt been able to identify the exact nature of the malfunction.Michael continued across the cargo bay and walked through the engine room door.The engine room was cramped and narrow and cut directly between the two large engine blocks at the back of the ship.Most of the wiring, piping and valves were exposed, which made it easier to work.Ethan was musing over a panel of indicators at the back of the room.He glanced at Michael as he entered.The release valves are stabilising, said Ethan.I knew it wasnt going to be a problem, said Michael.Ethan walked over with a nervous smile.Captain, this ship is a wreck.Look at all these aging components.Its not just the pressure release valves; the whole ship is falling apart.Im surprised it has lasted this long.Most of the components need to be replaced, and we need a complete rewiring of the entire ship.Its not that bad.Remember shes an Armorstonian Cruiser.The Armorstonians didnt build ships to fall apart.Ethan shook his head.Captain, the Armorstonians made great ships in their time, but if you dont service them regularly and replace defective parts, well, to be honest, they will fall apart like any other ship.Most of the components on this ship are original; Ive written a list of everything that needs to be replaced.Captain, youre looking at a price tag of one hundred and fifty thousand credits, and thats just the urgent repair work.Michael didnt say a word for at least ten seconds.His eyes scanned the exposed wiring and electronic components.Look, Ethan, I dont have that kind of money.I think youre doing a great job keeping the ship together.I believe in your skills.Youre the best mechanical engineer I have ever worked with.I dont think Ill ever meet a better engineer in my life.Flattery wont keep the ship flying, muttered Ethan, looking away.You know Ill do the best I can, but you have to understand Im limited by what I have to work with.Michael gave Ethan a friendly slap on the shoulder.Keep up the good work, he said as he turned and walked back to the cargo bay.**  The journey across the alien battle zone was set to take them approximately twelve days at full speed.Usually during long distance space travel the crew would enter the deep sleep pods and remain in stasis for the entire trip.Ajax always refused to enter deep sleep, or go under as he described it.Often Michael would sleep intermittently throughout a long trip, and Ethan would wake every two days to check the ships systems before returning to deep sleep.Michael actually liked the fact that Ajax refused to enter deep sleep, because it meant that he constantly had someone on board who was keeping watch.Everyone in the galaxy had heard stories of ships being boarded and looted whilst their occupants slept.The Out Drifter had automatic security systems to prevent such an unfortunate event, but no amount of automatic security was a substitute for a real person.Michael lay back in his sleeping pod.A panel of glass slid over his body.He hit the operation switch; an instant later he was asleep.**  Ajax had a unique way of escaping the confines of the ship.On one of his first missions he had salvaged an ancient virtual reality simulator from an abandoned wreck.The simulator came with two helmets; once placed on his head the helmet would project light waves into his eyes and electrical impulses into his upper spinal cord.He could use the virtual reality simulator to explore hundreds of virtual worlds which were loaded onto the system.The worlds were so real that the brain was completely tricked into thinking they were actually reality.Such technology was known for its tendency to make its users addicts.In the virtual world there were no consequences and no hardships.Whats more, the player could often develop the virtual world to suit their particular interests.The risk of using virtual reality machines was well known throughout the galaxy, and the technology was shunned by most people who regarded it as potentially unproductive and life destroying.
