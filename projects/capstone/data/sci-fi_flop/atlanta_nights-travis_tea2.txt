He smiled lazily at her, glad that he  worked out, because it must be his abs and  his muscles that made him so easy to remember.Their faces got closer together.He was  looking at her in the dim light from the  bar, ignoring the jangling music.It was noisy  in here, and stank of beer and other things  he didn't want to think about.So he thought  about her.Looking down at her like this, her  shirt gapped open more, and he could see the  top of her bra.Those big, jiggle breasts, so  close to him.They were making his jeans uncomfortable."Let's forget what you want to a fogey, then, "Steven encouraged.She smiled a  little bit, and those rosy red lips parted.Her   teeth shone like perfect pearls in the dim  light.He wanted to taste those lips.She closed her eyes and tipped her head back some  more.That was his cue, he could tell.So he pushed his lips against hers.Her lips were warm and soft and tasted like breath mints.It was good.She sighed  a little bit, and he thought she would pull away  then, but she didn't.So he made the kiss  better.He ran his tongue along those perfect  teeth.The feeling made him more sure he  wanted to get her out of this bar."This isn't a very good place to kiss," he stated."But it was a very good kiss. "She exclaimed dreamily!He paid the bill, then put his sweater  around Margaret's shoulders.Wait her," he  mentioned meaningfully."Ill bring my car around. "His Miata, bright red like her lips, sparkled with raindrops like diamonds in the  light from the streetlights.Margaret giggled  whilst he held the sweater over her head and  led her out to the car."Climb in, fair princess," He chuckled, holding the door, open.Soon that sexy nurse, was sitting close to him on his sculpted, dark blue velvet  sofa.The lava lamp glowed on her face.Blues made her look mysterious.Reds shouted  "Sex!"Her eyes were deep pools of mystery.He put in a DVD that his last girlfriend had said was sexy.The music filled the room with drumbeats like heartbeats, and a rhythm like to people  humping."Let me give you a massage" he said."I give really good massages!""Im waiting. "She turned her back to him, and he laid his hands on that sexily  slender neck."I need to pull your shirt up. ""Mmm hmm!"He started to massage the tight muscles   of her back.She was so tense, but he  could fix that.A little oil.Patchouli.Down to her slender waist, then her voluptuous hips.Ease tension, and he could smell her reaction, even over the oil.Yes, she was ready.He  turned her over, massaged those breasts, D cups at least, with his sc3ented fingers.Did he  take off her bra?Did she?And who undid her skirt?All he knew was that her muscles  softened and her tension went away under his skilled fingers, and then her muscles  tightened again as she pulled frantically at the zipper of his jeans.That was when he pushed his fingers, into  her yielding brown hair and pulled her  face to his.Their tongues met like wild beasts, their dance ageless and timeless."You  have a hell of a body," she exclaimed into his mouth."So do you," he moaned.Even if  she was older than I, she was still hot.His raging manhood was bursting at the seams of his jeans, and so he undid the  zipper she couldn't.She was moaning, lying on   the soft velvet of the sofa, completely  abandoned to his will.As they came together, he thought how much better this woman,  who was experienced and sexy and had been  padding on all the right places was to make  love to than the teenagers who threw themselves at him for his body.They writhed together, like wild beasts, on the velvet, somehow moving to the  deep shag on the floor.His hands, still oily, massaged her ass as he moved inside her.She  panted, against his chest, she breathes getting more and more agitate.Steven could tell  she was really getting into this.He was turning her on.So he got faster and faster, and  finally, she screamed "Henry!"and went limp underneath him.Her waves of passion set off Stevens,  and her passion pumped him dry.She lay  with her head on his chest, looking up into his eyes.The light from the lava lamp was  purples and golds now.Purple and gold  the   colors of passion.It shown on her face,  damp with sweat from their wild sex.The  purple made her glazed brown hair look like  some exotic African princess, naked and willing.After a few minutes, he started again.* * *         Steven was tired the next day, because he  and Margaret had made love more than  one time.First in the living room, then in  the bedroom, then in the bathroom in the  shower.Then he took her home, and they      had held hands like little kids and kissed  outside her door.He couldn't remember any  woman or boy as hot as she was.None of  those teen agers had ever been like this.He defiantly wanted to see her again.He was giving a massage to one of the regulars at the Polo Club, and a guy named  Isaac Stevens.Steven wasn't interested in  Stevens, because the guy was too old.Besides that, he had Margaret on his mind.But he must have yawned one too many times."Late  night last night?"wondered Stevens.His voice was kind of muffled by the table he was  laying face down on."Oh, yeah," Steven muttered dreamily.He  wished it was Margaret's back he was  massaging right now.Or maybe somebody else he  could get a quickie in with.Thinking  about Margaret was making Steven hard."She must have been something, "Stevens guffawed wickedly."Or was it a he?""It was a girl, no a woman.Not just any  woman.The best I ever met," enthused  Steven.Stevens wriggled on the massage table.He was probably getting hot, thinking  about Stevens' night last night."Does she   have a name, or, are you keeping her, all to  yourself?""You know those center folds of, naughty nurses?I think they're all true.That's  what she is, a nurse.At the Atlanta General hospital, right across town. "Stevens mused, "Every time I ever went  to the hospital the nurses, would hardly  talk to me.Must be?""Probably. "Stevens mind was not on the conversation.It was on Margaret.He  could tell she did like his abs.And his ass, the way she had gripped it           "Well, does, she have a name" Stevens said one more time?"Oh, yes.Margaret Eastman."He drew       the name Margaret out like a kiss."Maaar gaaa reeeet. "Bruce rubbed the thick foam collar around his neck with his good hand.The  stupid thing itched badly and he knew it looked  darkies but the surgeon had insisted that  he must ware it constantly for the next mont h or suffer the consequence.At least it kept  his neck warm in the frigid air conditioning  in this restraint.He followed Isaac Stevens  who followed the waiter around past the side entrance and between tables and a booth at  the back.Bruce stomped his cane down on a lady's foot at one of the tables and she swore  at him: "Damn stupid gimp!Whence watch out were yes going' with that damnable  misbegotten whoreson stupid cane you a dam adjt.!""Gaseous, you old bat!"he howled."Watch your own feet and keep them out of  the way so I don't trip over them!Don't you know who I am?Give me any more trouble  and I'll have your ass arrested so far your false teeth will pop out of your head!"Three waiters hurried over."I'm so sorry  Mr.lucent" they sniveled.One of them  turned on the old lady and shouted "Backs off,  you!That's Mr.Lucent and he owns half  this town!"Another waiter spoke up and yelled "Why he owns more than half of this here  Trotters Corners and that's a fact!"They  gathered around her and knocked her out of her  chair, then kicked her a few times to teach her a lesson.Bruce limped on after Stevens, leaving the waiters to handle the woman.It was  stupid people like that who had inspired him to climb to the top.He didn't ever want to be  stuck with riffraff like that so he had us ed the computer skills he had learned from  cracking play station games and writing viruses  on the internet to build his company to a  person was today.A giant among software de velopment companies!Not bad for a guy  just out of his teens.He bumped another table with the cast   on his leg but the people there cringed."Sorry Mr.Lucent" one declaimed "I hope that didn't hurt you. ""No" he offered magnanimously, "I'm okay. "He limped across to their booth and  slid in across from Stevens."So, what did you want to talk to me about?"he growled."Let's have a drink first and get someth ing to eat" soothed Isaac."That dumb old  lady seems to have upset you so let's relax for a while and then we'll talk about business. ""Suits Me Fine" offered Bruce.He turn    ed to the waiter."I'll have a Shirley  Temple Screwdriver with absolute vodka on the rocks. ""Yes sir!"exclaimed the waiter."And you, Mr.Stevens?""Spays burn, on the rocks, with a little Pepsi.A good single malt needs a little  sweetening. ""I prefer Mountain Dew with my singl e malts" quibbled Bruce."Or maybe prune  juice.It's more natural somehow. ""My daughter, Irene, likes it with root beer, but she's a little weird. "Chuckled  Stevens.He rubbed his pepper and salt beard,  then brushed backs his close trimmed hair."I heard about your accident at the Polo Cl  ub.Guesses you're lucky to be alive.Henry  Archer went off the road on the same curve a few nights later in his Humvee but he didn't  survive.The cops said someone had dumpe d a bunch of used oil on the shoulder near  there.That might have been what got you and Henry. ""Could be?I was only doing 95 but I slid right  off when I got there.Had to throw  away the boxer shorts I was wearing.They we re nice ones, too.Glow in the dark green  with luscious red lips printed all over them.I miss those shorts" whined Bruce.He  scratched at his crotch where the leg cast rubbed and itched.The waiter returned with their drinks.He set them down and then set a big  foaming mug of beer in front  of each of them as well."Compliments of the house, sirs.Mr.Gronomon said you two looked a little thirsty. ""Great!"Said Isaac.Nothing like a cold fr osty mug of heavy dark beer to go with  my single malt.Helps wash away the taste. ""What will you gentlemen have for lunch?"Quarried the waiter?Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair."Lets starts with pate de foie gras and cavia r and a basket of crackers to spread them on.Triscuits, wheat thins, stuff like that.And some stuffed mushrooms and truffles on the side.And a couple of triple thick chocolat e mocha latte to drink. "He might be 50 now  but he could still pack it away.Nothing that a few good rounds of racquet ball and polo  wouldn't burn back off.Too bad Bruce wa  s all knocked up.Bruce had such a studly  body, rock0 hard abs and massive shoulders fr om working out and weight lifting, but he  was starting to get just a little pudgy since the accident.Isaac had seen him in the locker  room at the gym.Kid was pretty we        ll hung, too.Probably had chicks throwing  themselves at him all the time.He'd be    tter stay away from Isaac's daughter, Irene  Stevens, though!Kid was making a lot of        money with his software development  company, too, and Isaac wanted a piece of that.If he could buy his way in now, he might  be sitting really pretty in a few more years."I'd like some artichoke hearts and pickled eggs, too" mused Bruce lucent."And make sure there's plenty of whipped cream on my latte. ""Yes Sir!"exclaimed the waiter.He hurried off to do their bidding in the kitchen.Bruce rubbed his rock hard abs.I'm ge tting a little pudgy with all this inactivity  since the accident he mused.I'll have to really  work to get back in shape once I'm better.A good thing that shrapnel just nicked my thigh rather than cutting a little higher or I  might be singing a little higher.Wouldn't want to?Disappoint the ladies.The sunlight was very warm on his       face and side from the window and he  wondered if he was going to start sweating.Fi re and ice he thought to himself.Too cold  air conditioning and too hot sun.I'm being fro zen on one side and roasted on the other.I'll be shivering and sweating at the same time.Isaac will think I've got a fever.Fire and  ice, ice cream and jalapeno, ice water and  steam, cold and hot, freezing on one side and  roasting on the other.He fled uncomfortable, like he had the flu and had a fever."It's kind of chilly in here " commiserated Isaac."How come you look so hot?""It's this sunlight, groaned Bruce, "I 'm boiling on one side and freezing on the  other. "The waiter brought their appetizers and set them in front of them."More beer," he  queried?"It's on the house. ""Sure" quipped Bruce and Isaac together.The waiter refilled their mugs."Hot enough for you?"he quipped?"Yes," shivered Bruce.I'm boiling on one side and freezing on the other. ""Like Fire and ice. ""Try the cold beer," offered the waiter.  "That should help cool you down some. "Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair."Here's to further success with your company,"  he enjoined.Bruce returned the toast and  they clanged their frosty mugs of dark beer together, than swilled large mouthfuls down. ""Ahhh ...," declaimed Bruce, "That was good.Cold. "They tucked into the appetizers.There was pate de foie gras and caviar and  stuffed mushrooms and truffles and artichoke  hearts and pickled eggs and crackers and  they washed it all down with cold frosty dark beer in foamy mugs and sipped their latte."Aaaah ...  "exclaimed Bruce, "That wa s really good.How about some real food  now?""Oh, yes, "agreed Isaac" some real food w ould really hit the spot now.Waiter, I'd  like a half pound of rare T bone steak smothe red in mushrooms and onions and a baked  potato with cheese and sour cream and bacon  bits and steamed baby carrots and corn on  the cob. ""Yes sir!"exclaimed the waiter."And you Mr.Lucent?""I'll have a roasted chicken stuffed with  truffle and cranberry dressing, a baked  potato with butter and sour cream, and a side of some baby back ribs. ""Yes Sir!"he declaimed and hurried off to the kitchen.Bruce scratched at his neck brace."Who was that babe I saw you with at the party  last week?"he simpered.Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair."That was my daughter, Irene Stevens.She came to the party with me. ""Your daughter?"inquired Bruce?"Wow.She was really hot.I'd surely like to get  to know her better. ""Well," countered Isaac, "That might be  arranged, as long as things go all right,  you understand. ""Cool," quipped Bruce, who was feeling  hot on one side and cold on the other."Fire and ice. "Bruce wanted to get out of  all these casts and things first, though.And to  get all his stitches out.Or maybe not.She mi ght feel more compassionate toward him if  she saw him this way first and that could l ead to more passionate fun later.What a hot  babe!He could hardly wait to see her with   her clothes off.They'd start slow, maybe a  game of strip poker or something classy lik  e that and then once they were ready they  could go right for the brass ring.His slacks tightened and he winced as one of his stitches  pulled out.Bruce rubbed his throbbing crotch where the cast rubbed and the stitch had pulled  out and his pants were too  tight now."So, " he inquired?"What did you want to talk  about?"Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then brushed backs his close trimmed hair."Well, " he countered."You've been very successful with your software company and I'd  like to talk about that.I really admire a   successful man who makes a lot of money and  you're one.Especially as young as you are,   to be so successful and making so much  money, if you know what I mean.I admire that. ""Yes, " agreed Bruce."I am doing rather well and I enjoy making money.Not the  money so much as all the things it can buy.A ll the wonderful things I can do with it.I  own half of this town, Trotter's Corner, now  and someday I'd like to  own half of Atlanta  itself.First I'm going to name this to  wn, though.I'm going to name it Lucentville!Do  you hear that everyone?This town is now   Lucentville!And someday Atlanta will be  named Lucent City!"Everybody cheered and the waiter brought their food."More Beer," he carried?"It's on the house!. ""Sure!"they quipped and dug into their food."Well," chewed Stevens around his steak and potatoes and onions and mushrooms  and corn on the cob, "I'd like to invest in your company.I'd like to give you a lot of  money so that I can have a part of your company and I'll introduce you to Irene, too. "Bruce scratched at his neck brace."Well," he gobbled past his roast chicken and ribs,                        "That sounds quite decent of you.I think I'd like that.And I'm                        especially looking forward to getting to know Irene Stevens better,                        if you know what I mean. "Wow,  was she hot!Fire and ice!They                        devoured their food   and drank more toasts from tall, foamy,                        mugs of ice cold beer."To Lucentville!""To Lucent Software Development Corp.!""To Irene Stevens!""To Life!""Fire and ice!"At last they finished their meals.Isaac rubbed his pepper and salt beard, then  brushed backs his close trimmed hair."How about some desert?"inquired Isaac.Bruce rubbed his throbbing crotch where  the cast rubbed against it and his stitch  had pulled out and his pants were swollen with lust."Dessert would be great!"declaimed  Bruce."I'm famished!. "Fire and ice.Margaret and Irene sat in silence for    thirty two minutes, each gathering their  thoughts together, each afraid to say the first word, knowing that the first word could lead  anywhere, including the truth.Irene signaled for a latte with one hand and fingered her long blonde hair with the  other twisting it again and again until it spiraled  like a golden staircase leading to the top  of her head.When the pain started, she wept, expostulating "I don't know what I'll do  without Henry.He was the center of the world. ""Even the center of the world has to die  sometime. "Margaret sat sideways in her  chair, her breasts a pair of protruding Alps."He didn't seem like the kind of man w  ho died," Irene said."Sometimes, when  were in bed, making love, at the very edge  of the surf where the waves washed over us  again and again, I looked at hi s face and saw something there that not even all the forces  of erosion could ever wash away.He was a determined man, and in his position he had to  be: and I knew that, too, looking  up at him wanting only for him to be there forever.He  was old, you know: he was around in the seve    nties and everything.But there was an  agelessness to him, a beautiful eternal foreverness that shone from him like the light from  a lighthouse, or like the sunlight from the s un.He made me feel like a child again, and I  wanted to stay in bed with him, feeling  him warm my world, cooled by the waves that  washed over us, until the stars went out.That   what I expected anyway.That's what he  promised.And now he's dead.His heart's stopped. "Margaret's eyes darted toward Irene in expressive regard."Yes. ""What am I supposed to do without him?"The unanswerable stolidity of the question echoed in the space between them, and  there was nothing Margaret could say that c ould make the other woman feel any better.As a nurse who had been taking care of peopl e about to die and who had died for longer  than most people could guess, she had spoken  to her share of people mourning the death  of their loved ones.She had earned a nationw ide reputation for her bedside management,  as she always knew what to say to make peopl e take the deaths of those they cared for  most for just another part of life that need ed to be endured and which would be one day  feel better.Doctors always asked Margaret  to help when their patients died.But some  deaths were not like other deaths, some deaths were too much to be borne.Some deaths hit those who were left     behind like a bomb exploding in their  houses, leaving just rubble behind.Margar    et did not know what to say to this  spectacularly beautiful woman before her, to  make her feel better that the man she loved  more than she loved life itself had been so cruelly taken from her.A tear formed at the corner of her own  eye (the left) as she shook her head and  said, "I don't know.Sometimes we lose the whole reason we're alive.Sometimes we have  to go out somehow and find a new reason.A   reason not dictated by law or morality or  even sense.Some new person to love.Some new way to live.Some new purpose to make  the night seems warmer.I think Henry was probably the kind of man who knew that if he  ever died in a horrible car accident, leav ing you behind, that you would find the courage  to stand up and move on and climb out of  this place where you are.He would not want  you to be here, now.Or ever.He would wa nt you at the beach where you were at your  best, in the waves, in bed. ""Maybe. "Irene swigged her steaming latte in one scalding gulp."And maybe   "         "Maybe what?""I remember one night, the best night for us.He took me to Rome where we stood  in the light of the Eiffel Tower and watched the people go by.There was one couple there  who reminded us of us.There was another  man Henries age and another woman my age  and they were laughing together, just   laughing, hard you know the way people laugh  when they really feel the joy of life,  the two of them, laughing!Laughing!Laughing, til  the tears came down the sides of their faces  in great cascades, and I was a little worried  that they would not be able to breathe but   Henry said, look at them, Irene, just look at  them, look at her and look at him, look at  them, the very themes of them, you know it's not a she and a him but a them, two of them  together, in one unit, laughing and laughing  here in the city of brotherly love, their laughs echoing and echoing and echoing up and  up and up drowning out the traffic and the conve rsations of other tourists and the singing  of the Christmas cajoler and even the mo   tor noises, filling the world, it was a lot of  laughing, and me remember Harry squeezing my hand's til the bones hurt and saying, you  know, I laughed like that once, many years ago, when I was a boy, and I don't even  remember the joke anymore but I always wa nted to laugh that way again and sometimes  when I take a good look at you I think I have  a chance.And I never thought of it again  but he also said that night, you know, honey, I' m much older than you and that means I'll  be dead before you, and it will be worth dying ev en in a terrible car wreck if that means  that between now and the moment of that car wreck we laugh at least once as hard as that  couple walking by just now, though they were  long past us by the time he got around to  saying that.He said make me laugh like th   at again Irene.And I said surely, but you  know, there was always the older man, younge r woman thing and as much as I thought  of him as some kind of God me never once got around to making him laughs. "Twisting  her hair into a braid using the same finger  she had been using before she said, "And now  I will have to live my entire life, however l ong that turns out to be, knowing that I never  gave him what he wanted.I made him come but never made him guffaw. "The sun broke through the clouds then   its brilliant golden disk burning a hole  through the great puffs of water vapor to   send a shaft of golden light zigzagging down  through the layers of atmosphere and warm the earth in a way that no sunlight since the  beginning of time had ever warmed the earth  before.Somewhere a child was being born.Somewhere a dog was barking.Life was going on but in this one moment at this particular place in time and space.The two  beautiful women, one twisting her hair into  knots, the other sittings sideways, were not part  of it.They were here only for each other  and for the memory of a great man who had walked the earth like a rock in the sand.Life  is like that sometimes, thought Margaret help lessly.Sometimes is just an interruption in  the day and not a part of it.The trick is knowing when it's day and when it's night and the  lightness or darkness has nothing to do with   telling the difference between them.The  death of a man like Henry Archer was definitely night even if it took place at noon.It was  like an eclipse of the world.There must ha   ve been people even in distant primitive  villages who had felt the moment he breathed his last.They must have looked up at the  night sky or even the day sky and said, what was that, meaning him.Irene lit a cigarette and blew out a huge  cloud of smoke."What am I going to do  without him?"she wailed."What?"Margaret had no answer except for the ones she had already given.Richard studied the menu like a shark sa voring a school of school of fish while  the waiter impatiently tapped his fountain pen against his pad.Across the table, he felt  Callie's eyes upon him, waiting for him to make up his minds.Yet his mind wasn't on  lunch, but upon Callie; he could sense her own im patience with him, as if she was trying  to decide whether she wanted to be dining with him at all, or whether she would be just  as happy to be eating by herself."I'll take the filet mignons," he said."Rare, please, and with the garlic mashed  potatoes.And to start  hmm, perhaps th  e New England clams chowder. "He briefly  consulted the wine list."And perhaps a bottle of Riesling, please.1999 vintage. ""Very good, sir. "The young waiter, whose name tag said his name was Frederick,  and who sported a pencil thin mustache, studiously jotted it all down, then turned to  Callie."And for you, madam?May I recommend the calamari souffl  it's in a season. ""Yes, I think so," she said stiffly.A  nd a chef's salad to start.But hold the  dressing, please. ""As you wish, madam. "Frederik clicked  his pen, then moved off into the hustle  and bustle of the restaurant.Le Bonhomie was busy today, busier than usual; Richard ate  here often, usually with other Peachtree Street brokers who he was trying to get info from  about deals they were making.It was one of the best, most fashionable bistros in Atlanta,  which is why he liked it so much.The serv ice was superb, and the food was pretty good,  too."And so," Richard said, as he unfolded  his napkin and laid it daintily across his  lap, "how are you getting along, now that Henry is gone?"Callie reached into her handbag, pulled    out a compact."As well as could be  expected, I suppose," she said, opening it to st udy her reflection in its mirror."Oh, I miss  him so much, but " She sniffed, then closed it and tucked it back in her bag."Well, life  must go on, you know.Life must go on. ""Yes, it does. "She wore a black silk dress to day, low cut, better to expose the  generous mounds of her bosom.Callie was  a fine looking woman, Richard had to admit,  and the dress left little to his teeming imagination; her nipples, like the silver dollars he  used to collect when he was a kid, pressed against the fabric, arousing him."Yes it does  indeed.Life must go on. "Callie observed his interest.She pouted,  looking like the Mona Lisa having a bad  day."Is there a reason why you asked me to co me here, Richard?"Then she lowered her  voice to a husky contralto."Or should I call you Dick?"He caught her meaning, found his livid f ace turning red."No," he said."Richard  would be just fine, Callie.I was just admiring your dress.From China, isn't it?""Yes," she said."From Hong Kong.Henry took me there many years ago, for one  of his boring business trips.I loved the shops .I thin k I must have spent hours in them,  bung things you can't buy here in America.And he was very generous, too.I think I must  have maxed out an American Express Plati  num Card just on clothes and jewelry.Oh,  what a trip that was!""I can imagine," Richard said.He wondere d if the police would be interested in  her purchases when she was abroad.He ha d little doubt that many of them had not been  declared with U. S.  Customs.But a woman like her wouldn't have, have had much trouble  dealing with lowly Customs inspectors, now  would she?She would have just smiled her  and winked and perhaps slipped a hundred dollar bill across the counter, ands a horny  young Customs inspector would have let the rich dame pass.Happens all the time."And  it fits you well, too," he added.She glowered at him from across the tabl e."You're not here to ask me about my  wardrobe," Callie said."What do you really have on you're mind?Really?""Oh, you know. "Richard Isaacs crossed his legs casually, like a king sitting upon  his throne and examining a peasant who had come to him in supplication."Don't quote "Alice in Wonderland" to me ," she quietly seethed."You're up to  something, and I want to know what it is!"Oh, she was a tempestuous little wench, wasn 't she?Henry Archer didn't deserve  her  hadn't deserved, he reminded hims      elf.20 years younger than he was, and  manipulative as Hell's own vixen, but she' d known how to spend his money, didn't she?But now Henry was gone, an ans.she had been  left with his considerable fortune, along  with his company, and Richard was interest ed in both.The company and the widow who  controlled it that is."I'm wondering what you intend to do with   Richard's company," he said, as the  waiter returned with the first  part of their meal."Do you intend to keep it, or is it your  intent to sell?"She waited while the waiter, Frederic, placed her salad in front of her, then saved  a generous portion of black pepper and Parmesan cheese on top of it.She glared at the  plate."There's anchovy on this," she huffe d."I cannot abide by anchovies.Remove it at  once, please, and bring me another. ""Oui, madam.Anything to please.        "The waiter looked annoyed, but he  disappeared with the plate, and came back   a second later with a fresh salad, without  anchovies.Satisfied, she speared a crouton with her silver fork and shoved it into her  mouth.The waiter smirked with disdain, then  carefully placed a bowl of New England  Clam Chowder in front of Richard.It was hot  and fragrant, just the way he liked it; he  smiled and nodded."Bon appetite," Frederick said, then he moved away to attend to his  other customers."I haven't decided about the company  yet," Callie drawled, chewing thoughtfully  upon her food."I suppose I could sell it, but ...  "She hesitated, daubing at the corners of her eyes with her napkin."Oh, what would Henry say, if I sold the company he struggled  so long and hard to build. ""I imagine he would want you to do what  was best for you. "Once again, Richard  found himself examining her cleavage.So soft,  so firm; like Florida cantaloupes, ripe for  the picking.Although she was young enough to       be his own child, he found himself  wondering what it might be like to have her   in bed, to run his hands through her silky  black tresses, to knead and stroke and cajole her breasts into submission, to slip his hands  between her thighs and explore the damp, wa rm secrets within.Henry Archer must have  done this, time and time again, when they we re married, and Henry had been only a few  years younger.And now ...No!He couldn't!Once more, Richar d found himself becoming aroused, and he  fought to keep his mind on the immediate probl em at hand."You could do this," he said,  idly stirring the bowl of chowder, "but the company stock, put on the open market now,  could fetch quite a high price.Perhaps even  ten times as much as its presently worth on  the New York exchange.You could be very rich. ""I'm already rich," Callie said, but there wa s a flash of avarice in her dark eyes as  they rose to meet his."Ten times as much, you say?Surely you jest!""I'm not joking.Have you seen today's    "The Wall Street Journal?"The story  about Henry's car crash has sent the pr  ices through the ceiling.The NASDAQ itself is  running wild.It's the talk of the town!"Rich ard stared back at her."The time to sell is  now, Callie, and I'd only too pleased to help.If only you'd let me. "Her breasts heaved against the taught fabric of her black dress, and again his eyes  fell to them.Yes, she would be grateful.And once she'd properly expressed her gratitude, perhaps his friends in the police department w ould be grateful to him.Henry's tragic car  accident had been too convenient, too swift.Callie Archer had more secrets than what  she had hidden beneath her Victoria's Secret li ngerie.And all he needed to do was to get  at them, and he would be ...A dark shadow falls across the table,  and a new voice interrupted them."Pardon  me," it said, "but is this seat taken?"Richard jerked his head up, peered at   the uninvited intruder.Bruce Lucent, the  software developer.Young, handsome, well  known around Atlanta for the software he'd  developed.What was he doing hear?"I couldn't help but overhear," Bruce said,  as if in answer to the unasked query."Callie, I'm so sorry to hear about Henry's death.He meant so much to the rest of us. ""I didn't know you knew him well. "Richar d couldn't help but notice how Callie's  eyes roved over him.Bruce was younger even       than Callie, yet even despite the auto  accident he'd suffered his body was lean and   trim, with a youthful verve that Richard  could barely remember."Please, have a seat.We just ordered. ""Why, thank you.I think I will. "Bruce move  d to the empty chair at the table,  then snapped his fingers for the waiter."Garcon!A menu, please. ""Oui.At once, m'sieur!"And as the waiter hurried away to fetch a board for the  unexpected interloper, Richard realized that the plot had thickened, indeed.Penelope Urbain let out the clutch as she sped around the curve.She felt a thrill   partly from the roaring engine, from the   speed of the car (she was moving fast, too  fast, on a suburban street, and she liked the speed too much).Partly, no, mostly  mostly  it was the thrill of anticipation.She was going to meet Bruce Lucent, and she was eager  to see him.She could not have said why she wanted him so badly, but she did.Wanted to see  him!That was all it was, she was curious,   maybe more than curious.Eager, but  not  too eager.There.That was his home.That was where she meant to be.She hit the brakes hard, skidded to a stop in front of his home.He was in the doorway, waiting for her.Penny, he said.Ive been waiting for you.There was a hint of suggestion in his smile, something that whispered to her  dreams.She embraced him, whispering his name.Bruce, she whispered, and felt a chill  at the turgid warmth of his body.He kissed her, so lightly.He wanted her,  she could feel it in his lips.She wanted  him, too, but not so easily  not here, not  now.(She thrilled at that thought.Here!Now!No!)Dinner, she said.Where will we go?Ive got reservations for us at Le Moulin de la Gallette, Bruce said.Penelope Urbain knew the place  it was French, continental, lit by candles,  elegant and intimate; shed gone there once,  alone, and eaten Saucisses de Francfort by a  window in the back that looked over the moonlit garden ...Thatd be nice, she said.
