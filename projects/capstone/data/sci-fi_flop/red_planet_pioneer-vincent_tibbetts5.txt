As one connected the dots, one could sense an energy flowing between them and the grid it created was well beyond electric.Alec could see this as plainly as the astronomers who once thought they saw canals crisscrossing the Martian surface.Those astronomers wanted to believe in the canals, because it would have spoke of a truth for higher intelligence and life beyond Earth.Upon review, once a person opened their mind to such possibilities of extreme global stewardship, it was hard for Alec to believe anyone would ever go back to having such an ignorance about their own world, yet the Earth was looked at with an attitude of being able to digest all the waste and pollution humans could throw at it.The planet was expected to rebound from all the deforestation, commercial fishing, and mining they wanted to extract.Human beings were killing off the ecosystems, but no matter how hard they tried they could not kill the planet.Their world began to show them it wanted to rebound without their existence.That was a truth that smacked humanity square in the face.In return humankind reveal the ugly, vain nature of itself.The colonization effort on Mars had no time for such egocentric thoughts.Everything up here operated as having some sort of value to the colonists.Printed in black and white, for all to see were the statistics, charts, and graphs showing the base equations to deduce the success rate for any colony.If after punching those numbers in, the survivability of the colony was brought into question, then everyone involved was immediately put on alert.People seemed to easily monitor so many other things in their lives, how many hours they put in at work, the fuel they burned in their automobiles, or the amount of electricity they used in a month.They could oversee and even demand a bit of perfection out of those results, but they had a hard time policing themselves.If anyone needed indicators implanted within their system to monitor their own activities, it should have been humanity.They were in desperate need of a monthly report graphing out the peaks and valleys of their behavior.It baffled him they had developed as a species without such oversight technologies.They would baulk at any type of assistance in their own lives, yet cheer their sport heroes on under obvious tutelage and coaching.To him the lack of this kind of guidance was an obvious sign they were the product of evolution, allowed to run free, out on their own, amok.They were the wild.Alec had inside him a human history littered with the premise of wasted opportunity.Didnt they understand the gift they were given?The magic of their lives was anointed with characteristics that made it robust, elastic, and pliable.It had to be for human beings to survive all the muck and soot the natural world was willing to throw at them.Even under those adverse conditions people showed signs of hope.They wanted to make things better for their offspring, better for the next generation to come.In those futuristic societies there would be a freedom of self expression, the ability to create, and if everything came together at the right moment, even something like genius had a chance of spawning.Genius cannot be groomed or even planned for, and above all should never be looked at as a given thing, there isnt a social status or race that can guarantee it will be produced.So it was more than just a curious strategy to read about those governments that had its people conform to an ideological standard nipping something so precious as genius in the bud.It smacked all reason straight in the face.The plain and simple truth of it all was intelligence doesnt favor one race over another.Genius, even those with mad genius, saw the world as one.The world needed genius, to be able to bath in its wonder, and lap up the knowledge imparted upon them much like the parched grounds of Mars would soak up water.As one perused the pages of human history, how many Feynmans and Fermis had humans snuffed out?How many Einsteins and Newtons had they squashed?The world had more genius than it cared to admit.How many of them had looked up into the nighttime sky and wished for an intervention that would never come.In time this portion of human history would be looked at as a different kind of Dark Age, one that had gone out of its way to forsake its own people out of spite.STONE CARVINGS There were no secrets here, as a species, human beings learned to evade things for most of their existence.The ash from their reptilian predecessors had barely begun to settle as they scurried for shelter.As a breed they were vulnerable and right from the start.The creatures of the night wasted little time in coming for them, adverse weather struck down a fear from the skies.As time passed and they evolved, they even learned to avoid fighting with each other.Opposing tribes made their way up river to settle their grievances with another tribe, far into the future hostile leaders gave frightful orations as they moved armor all along their borders in a show of force demanding those on the other side surrender.People had skirted these types of scenarios for centuries, so if they could do that then how difficult was it for them to dodge something like the law?When one thought of a person being evasive, they thought in terms of their physical escape.Alec saw first hand as an inspector how people were able to use their words to accomplish this task.They twisted reality with the use of their language, showing forethought, their sentences were laced with intent.It was through the exact use of these words they had now reached a summit of their prevarications.Aloof, reclusive, narcissistic, eccentric, and idiosyncratic, all of them thrown together were a heterogeneous mixture, a somewhat tasty salmagundi of stratagem, a spicy olla podrida of their ploys, a hot gallimaufry to their gambit.It was no wonder people looked so slovenly over time, they butchered their words in order to cheat the system, making a complete meal of their nonsensical utterances.Its probably why Alec never felt an urge to be the first one to communicate with any of them when having an encounter.He knew where he stood, and it wasnt behind a dialog of doublespeak.He was strong enough as a person to not have to hide behind a defense like that.He always lagged upon first contact, just to see how strong the other person speaking to him really was.The people that hid behind words could build complete pockets of insanity.Alec had entered into more than one of those kinds of domiciles at La Compagnie dEtoile, he saw how unkempt they were, littered with their drug paraphernalia or their signs of mental derangement.He remembered seeing one room with garbage piled so high it literally had pathways cut through it just to get around.The resident of this particular flat sputtered out streams of dialog championing a thought process that came nowhere near touching a plain anyone else on the planet existed on.Alec had gotten an order to inspect this particular domicile for an unpleasant odor.One of the things he wanted to do was remove a ceiling tile to gain access to the compartment above the living quarters.The man went wild in response to what he was trying to accomplish.You cant do that!You fool, if you break the seal it will contaminate us all!Alec tried to keep a professional demeanor.Sir, I am required to look into this particular section of the building, are there contaminants I am unaware of within the ceiling that will pose a harm to you?Are you an idiot, of course there are!There are those who have a vendetta against me, they have been trying to kill me and right from the start.Ever since my arrival, they have sought me out, but I have out witted them!They cant find me insulated in here.I have created this environment to help me blend in with my surroundings.Do you know the nature of toxins contained within the ceiling?I dont know the nature of the toxins because they are changing the nature of their attacks against me everyday.Its why I have to stay down here and blend incant you see that?You should be trying to blend in as well.They will find you and destroy you, destroy your mind!As Alec stared at him, he thought it ironic that biospheres had all kinds of life saving procedures for the calamities that might befall them.Oxygen, food, water, blood, all were at the ready if the worse happened and the roof were to cave in on this place.Why would a person think after all the care they had taken to help with the preservation of a colonists life, they would suddenly find it within themselves to snuff one out, it was totally irrational.Its not even like this damn fool was important.In almost each and every encounter with an irrational tenant like this there was evidence of some sort of drug use.There was little he could do about it, the harden carapace of addiction demanded more than an argument based in logic to defeat it.Addiction was a selfish process, and the person caught in its clutches found themselves doing everything they could to defend their actions.This was a cadaverous world needing the light of humanity to be shown upon it.Those intervening knew the dangers yet formed their circle anyway, not to finish them off but to actually go in and save a life.The drugs were powerful, mind altering hallucinogens and if enough people fell under its spell, the colony would reach a tipping point and there would be no turning back.Their actions as a group would become unorthodox, preposterous, even ludicrous, driven by everything except for the act of caring for one of their fellow colonists.There were examples back on Earth of entire civilizations disappearing because of such group psychosis.Imagine if the people of an island committed all of their resources to the stone carvings of gigantic monolithic heads, then went about chopping down every tree in their forest to get them to their shores.They would prop those sculptures up along their banks in hopes of warding off anything arriving on their beaches that would attempt to upset their reign of lasciviousness.In each instance, when the tipping point for a civilization was reached, no one ever listened to the individual questioning their extreme actions.That type of inquiry usually didn't take place until those denizens were long gone.After serving his time at La Compagnie dEtoile, Alec felt the concept of intervention was the sole basis for Service Dextoid production.With this acknowledgement, he suddenly felt sorry for his species.Dextoids would never be free under a system like this.Once people got used to their support systems, they could never turn the clock back and live without them.In some ways Dextoid production had become their addictive drug.Technology was like that, pulling on the addictive qualities of every person using it, and the last thing they were going to do was pay attention to the individual trying to stop its flow.SUPPORT SYSTEMS As Alec crossed this planets surface he couldnt help but observe how close it was to wavering at being absolutely dead.The air and water had been leaving the planet for a few millennia now.The interior core had stopped rotating, the plate tectonics had stopped shifting, and the mantel had stopped renewing itself in a healthy active geothermal way.After spending a few days on Mars one could see why a planet like Earth was alive.Sometimes one needed to see the Ying in order to appreciate the Yang.The blue peril contained great oceans, it generated storms which carried with it dynamic atmospheric conditions like electricity, wind, and precipitation.Here was a planet fully functioning in the continual process of cleansing itself.Viewed from afar, Earth had plenty of lines, from tectonic rifts to the tidal conveyors churning within its oceans, from shifting jet streams to its lush green belts, and above it all a moon giving it stability along its axis.All of those things allowed for the planet to have a pulse, even for it to breathe.No one could say an individual organ on its own, like a liver or a kidney is alive, but when combined in the proper order and allowed to function in unison with the rest of the body parts, then the definition of life transforms and touches the very magic of it.So it was with all the weather patterns, volcanic activity and ecosystems on Earth.It had to be.The people of these biospheres wanted to give this planet a pulse.They wanted to see its skies filled with the purifying clouds of rain, and have a sense of the air carried to them by the breeze of a Martian ocean.If they could have that, this planet would offer its inhabitants something more comforting to the human spirit, the radiating warmth of its sun.People yearned to bathe in the warm glow of its star.It was a strange primitive wanting desire piloting human beings to be such a heliolatrous race.That warm orb gave them power, it was as if the reptilian brain took control of their thought process, driving them out onto warmer surfaces in search of the sun.They wanted to be thawed by it, to let its rays energize them, and to have the ability to bask in its presence.Since the colonists had gotten here, the planet seemed to be responding, this emaciated world was desperately trying to make a comeback.Mars was like a transplanted organ waiting for the clamps to be removed from its supporting arteries so the life force that was blood could once again flow through it.The organ would regain color, become vibrant, and function.One just needed to spend a little time immersed in the desperate energy of Mars to feel its determination in wanting to rebound.This energy in the end was what made Mars special.Was this not the key to lifes greater picture?For in the abundance of the ordinary, the things that were special, that stood out, should have been cherished.Was the Earth not the blue peril, Mars the New Hope, and his pursuit of I Glo because she was unique?As Alec pressed on, these thoughts cluttered his mind, never fully ridding himself of their importance.At best they trailed off behind him like the long knotted tail of a kite dancing freely in the breeze.Regardless of how good it felt to have those things in tow, he could not help but notice the feeling of being pulled along ever so slightly by the tug of a string.07 A Feeling Harvard was standing there with a volatile mixture of anger and contempt, this was it, this was the moment, no longer would he hide his feelings.Each and every person in this place was being pushed to the edge of their limits because of his actions.He knew this, but somehow Xavier was able to turn a blind eye to their suffering.Harvard wasnt built that way; it used to be that he and Xavier were a team.Recently though he wasnt quite feeling the bond of their friendship.None of this should have come as a surprise to him, especially when he considered what happened to Johnston.Xavier turned him in, plain and simple.Johnston, the poor bastard, never even saw it coming.That was the way Xavier had been playing it as of late, causing Harvard to become extremely sensitive about his surroundings.Xavier sat in his chair going over the mountain of paperwork that had been piling up on his desk.He knew Harvard was in the room, he was very aware of his sulking presence.He knew he had come there to speak with him.Xavier however could have cared less, acting as nonchalant as possible.None of his usual efforts to shoo Harvard away seemed to be working, it appeared this time Harvard was setting himself up to be heard.The air of this place has a very dry and metallic taste to it.It leaves one with a gritty feeling at the back of their throat.I have heard people complain of it as of late.Its an uncomfortable sensation we have to endure, and we both know why its happening, dont we.Xavier placed his stylist down very precisely on his desk, almost as if he were a parent being interrupted by a nagging child.He did it in such a manner to overtly telegraph the exactness by which the scolding was about to come.Are we going to have this conversation again?Harvard noted this reaction and did not appreciate his projected posture in the least.As if to mimic the child he was supposed to be, Harvard retorted in such fashion.And again and again and again, until you do something about it.The people back on Earth dictate policy and you seem far too happy to rewrite it until those mandates splay out of our structures like the tentacles of some wild mythological beast.The biospheres are nothing more than storefronts for corporate greed.We have become their puppets, and what do you do about it?You mandate your own people!You feed the voracious appetites of those greedy bastards by pushing your own people to work longer hours, take on more responsibilities, and all for what?So you can sit comfortably behind this desk and enact policy!I am simply doing what needs to be done.Harvard recognized this tone right away, and of all the attitudes Xavier could have taken this was the one that angered him the most.It was a stately voice, and Harvard latched onto it with sarcastic relish.Why yes your lordship, we wouldnt want the commoners to have too much personal time on their hands now would we.They might find it within themselves to wash away this metallurgic taste from the back of their throats, and if they had time to do that, then they might find the time to complain.The kingdom cant have any complaints now can it?!If these people were allowed to voice their opinions it might poke holes in the velvet blanket of peace the boys back in marketing have been so busily weaving.We dont want the nasty truth punching holes in that sewn fabric now do we?Xavier sat in his chair watching Harvard gesture about frantically trying to get his point across.He was always the one to panic first.Xavier felt between the two of them, Harvard could have easily been the preverbal canary in the cage.Anytime Xavier felt over worked, Harvard would be the one to cry out.It was disappointing, Harvard would always be Harvard, and that only had Xavier wanting to talk down to him all the more.Spaceships arent always going to make it here safely.The act of colonizing takes its toll on everyone, the loss of life is an inherent part of this process, much like the dead leaves that fall from trees.Our effort with all its difficulty doesnt even come close to comparing with how people suffered in the past trying to colonize their world.Every page of Earths history is splattered with the ruthless savagery that comes with colonization.Yet you act as though we are holding back on making things better for the colonists up here, that savagery simply does not exist. "Hogwash!"Harvard looked wild eyed as he shouted out his retort.It is the writers of history who have tempered the suffering of those in the past.The authors pen takes liberties, romanticizing explorers, painting them in the rich colors of the bold, the brash, and the adventurous...And is that how you see yourself?You repulse me!Its vulgar that you would see yourself in some future portrait lionized as what?An explorer?A leader?A founder of the new hope?Xavier leaned back in his chair, allowing himself to openly get a little more comfortable.He needed to show Harvard he didnt feel threatened by him in the least.After all it was he, Xavier with the knowledge for what they needed to get done.His vision for the future was secure, and no one could ever take that away from him.This didnt mean he was above reproach.He felt the corporation was going out of its way to challenge his authority.They seemed to combat his efforts by trying to wear him down with endless battles, constant in fighting and unending circular arguments.If he were ever going to quit on them it would be because they taxed him to the point of exhaustion.He had come too far with this company to just throw in the towel.All those pundits, those wannabes and hanger ons, they would see their own fate before he would see his.He would personally make sure of it; Harvard was included with that rabble now.He couldnt help the fact his vision for what needed to be done went well beyond their comprehension.One could play chess by thinking a move ahead, or play phenomenally great chess by seeing the end game first.Harvard was still building a head of steam for what he wanted to say, he wasnt standing in Xaviers office to pacify him, today was the day he came in for a fight.There was just too much at stake and neither he, nor anyone else, could sweep it under the carpet any longer.These historic figures you speak so highly of, they had another set of traits, they were often cruel, selfish, and manipulative.Thats what you have taken the time to build up here, your own obsequious system, and thats why these colonists hate you.Dont act as if you are untouched by their thoughts.Say what you want but you have changed, and not for the better.Youre the one adding another level of grit to an already merciless situation.In response these people have begun to mirror the untamed world you are creating for them.A cruel environment will produce a callous person, a wild west will produce a desperado, a fanatical ideology produces a suicide bomber, and in all those wakes a thing like innocence will be left out in the cold to be shanghaied.Xavier scoffed at this last remark.What of innocence?That quality died in him a long time ago.If Harvard thought he was reflecting the current environment fluctuating all around him, he was wrong.He knew he could turn into something just short of tyrannical if he allowed himself to become immersed in the sorted tidal pools of discontent that had formed within this firm.The energy for this ebbed and flowed on a daily basis, and there were times he wasnt strong enough to conceal his feelings for absolute rule.The reveal was as unsightly as a large oil slick matted against pristine ocean waters.The things spewed in those verbal outbursts would take days for his staff to clean up.They were epic scenes and witnessed by those unlucky enough to be in his presence.He berated the unsuspecting, accused others of incompetency, or worse yet issued frightening threats of succession.Some of his employees didnt take what he dished out and they would hold a grudge against him for years to come.None of it mattered to Xavier though, because in his mind that was what made them his employees.Yes, he had changed, but if these people thought they were seeing the ugly side of him even in those moments, they were wrong.He hadnt shown them anything yet.He did everything humanly possible to keep his composure, but when he did feel it slipping away, he would confine himself in his office.This place was his foundry.Here in this darkened room he would try to find his inner peace by poring over reports and planning for the companys future.This gave him plenty of time for reflective thought; it just wasnt the kind any rational person would have ever endorsed.APPLIED CONCEPT Xavier was about to cross a personal precipice, and if he were lucky enough to make it to the other side, he would never have to come back to any of this ever again.Everything he had worked for to this point in his life seemed to be coming to a head, and it made him feel a little off kilter.This could have been because of the sheer magnitude of the jump he would need to make.In this whole sorted affair, he had set certain things into motion that he just had to trust would be there when he needed them.It wasnt a question of if he would need them, it was a question of when.He was sure once the word got out about what he had done, a lot of people would misinterpret his actions.Xavier had to resign himself to the fact people were going to think what they wanted to think.None of their explanations could ever come close to the truth.All Xavier wanted to do was take leave, depart from the daily grind and shuck his struggle with the status quo.He examined his plan over and over again very carefully.No matter how many ways he looked at it, there really wasnt any room for another person to go where he was going to go, especially someone like Harvard, besides it wouldn't be difficult to find a lackey on the other side, this was the least of his concerns.He tried to be as gentle as he could with what he was about to say next, but it was hard to soften the menacing undertone of how he really felt.There are things out there that will shake this place to its foundation, regardless of how delicate I handle them, someone will always walk away feeling shanghaied.Are we going to talk about the arrival of the new moon again?I refuse to be dragged into your philosophical ramblings on what a new moon could mean to the colonists.I think that everyone is quite aware of what the practical applications are for this celestial body.Why else would they be sending for it?This planet is on the verge of wild celebration, and they should be, if they can pull this off it will be a monumental achievement, historical in every sense of the word.Yet you of all people walk around here as if you dont care.Harvard could see he had hit close to home with his comment and could not allow himself to ease up on his attack.Time was running out.The window for sanity was closing.He wouldn't get many more opportunities like this..Thats it, isnt it!This whole place is on the verge of wild celebration, and you dont feel a thing.Is it because you have no control over it, or is it just the fact you dont know how to use the event to your advantage?If we were a primitive people experiencing our first eclipse, you would have answers for us then, wouldnt you!You would try and tie the event back to some omen of cataclysmic upheaval or claims of manifest destiny.That type of sorcery doesnt work up here, does it?!Not with a team of scientists at the ready to refute your hokum!Harvard was reaching, all the time he was reaching, and for things he could never fully comprehend.A thing like the new moon was out there all right, but it was moving Xavier in a different way, validating the growing heaviness he had for this place.He knew the company was deliberately trying to bury him under a workload of responsibility.It was difficult not to be paranoid about his situation, the feeling seemed to come with the territory, and he continuously had to bilge those thoughts from his head.He wondered if Harvard wasnt in on their schemes.That of course would have taken the cake.From out in the deep reaches of this solar system, the new moon was approaching.This celestial orb was seen by many to represent the New Hope.As this body got closer it reached out with its subtle hand and began to take hold, tugging at the core of Mars, and tugging also at the core of Xavier.With each passing day his heaviness intensified.The approach of this moon was confirming an inescapable nagging truth; that anything making it all the way out here, came out here to stay.Harvard had arrived as well, and he was in a scrappy mood.He kept pressing his boss for answers, not allowing him the luxury of getting lost in thought.This new moon scares the living hell out of you, doesnt it?Does it make you feel as if you are losing control over your employees as well?Have you lost touch with yourself?How far gone are you?Harvard had crossed a line.How dare he question his sanity.The anger Xavier felt was beginning to bubble to the surface, but so too were his thoughts as to why Harvard would confront him like this?What if the corporation had put him up to this, and they had Harvard testing his confidence?It wasnt out of the question for the corporation to administer a Confidence Test.The company constantly tested people up here to be sure they still believed in the mission.The corporation didnt send out a notice announcing they would be testing people in this way, spontaneity was key and being questioned for it could happen at the drop of a hat.Harvard was just too persistent.It had to be a test!There were no other answers as to why he was acting so aggressive.All Xavier could do was ride the inquiry out.Confronting him now might reflect very badly on the report Harvard would submit later.He took a moment to ready himself in playing Harvards little game.You and I both know desertion is not a selling feature for any venture.That isnt a word they can put on the front cover of one of their brochures.Yet with the arrival of this new moon, this is exactly what they are telling us.What other choices do we have?No one is ever getting off this rock.Thats not true, they have sent people back before, look at Johnston.Yes, look at Johnston.He is a shining example of how they treat people.They will push you to a breaking point, and when you finally snap they will send you home to face the music.Its only a matter of time before we have to face that kind of music.Xavier was becoming keenly aware of the enthusiasms he was showing for this subject.He needed to throttle back.If he didnt, he would be setting himself up for a fall.Its either build a biosphere or build a jail.They dont have the money or resources to do both, and we dont have the time or the facilities to house those we suspect guilty of a crime.Thats what Earth is for, that's why they sent Johnston back.Seems pretty ironic all the things they accused Johnston of could be going on right under your nose, and yet you claim you had no clue as to what he was up too.I have been over and over this with the appropriate authorities...Xavier please, I am not some magistrate looking to try and trip you up over testimony you have already provided.Your truths are your truths.I have known you for a very long time now.I know when you are lying, or when you are taking liberties and stretching the truth.People arent stupid, just because they go around saying they havent prosecuted a person for a crime on Mars, doesnt mean crimes arent being committed.This is far from any kind of utopia.Most individuals up here have been involved in wrongdoing.The general public is pretty good at cutting through all the crap.They know when someone has been set up and when someone has been forced to take a fall.I mean think about it, they pull from their own life examples, and they realize there isnt a whole lot someone can do up here without at least one other person knowing what they are really up too.You cant stop them from talking.They talk behind your back all the time, they are probably talking right now, you arent above their judgment.Harvard was goading him on and Xavier knew it!He sat in his chair, reclining so his head was supported with his thumb and forefinger.Innuendo was a tough thing to battle.If you closely examined any of the facts from the Johnston case, they could easily transform into a mistrustful mosaic, revealing the Cimmerian side of the colonization effort.The corporations were deliberately trying to bury this darker world from public scrutiny, they wanted to ease the fears of people coming to Mars, not exacerbate them.Harvard was right in one respect, this was far from any kind of utopia.It was however, a land rich in supporting corporate greed.Governments are going to do whatever they need to do to get people to come up here.I personally have no control over that.Lets say for arguments sake, you were granted your wish, and those companies came clean, what then?The critics of this process have already torn them apart in the media every time a story of failure makes it off this rock.Even with all those reports buzzing about down there, most people dont care.Our problems arent their problems.Xavier propped his elbows up on his desk, interlocking his fingers and assuming a fatherly pose.The governments backing this process are very protective of the image they are trying to portray up here.They would never allow for a story like the one youre so eager to tell get out.Look around you for gods sake.They down play the accidents that happen here all the time.The threat of conflict is always reported as a minor disagreement.Those who have been ravaged by this process have their stories turned into a triumph of the spirit, portrayed as people having done so much with so very little.The companies themselves are amalgamating the perception of reality and feeding it back to Earth in tight little packages promoting this place.I have seen this media, to watch it you feel as though they are talking about another world we are colonizing, not Mars!Xavier found himself pointing at Harvard with both fingers now.His hands were still interlocked as if calling him to the carpet, and perhaps he was, but he wouldnt gain a thing by pushing the point any further.His tone changed, he wanted to understand the reason Harvard was in front of him.We both know things will never quite be up to snuff in an operation like this.One must accept the hoarding, the existence of black markets, and the fact that crime will follow people wherever they may go.There is this misnomer about wrong doing, as if we can identify the trouble spots before they erupt.The reality is there are no clear cut indicators, there are no mounds of garbage, dilapidated buildings, or graffiti written in enough sections of this complex directing us to where the trouble lies.It would be nice if crime worked like that, but crime doesnt want to operate out in the open.It acts like a chameleon, blending in with the world around it.Sometimes you have to remove the rocks to find the things crawling around underneath them.Sometimes in the midst of that process you discover something unexpected, something else that is wrong.That was how they caught Johnston.The silence that followed put Xavier on alert; Harvard wasnt buying into what he was saying.The room was filling with staunch disbelief.That was fine.When it came right down to it, Xavier really didnt care if Harvard believed him or not.He knew what he knew.Most governments werent just approving the use of emotional packets to control Dextoids, they were also working over the human population, forcing them to march to a different tune.He watched how those governments manipulated their citizens, moving in on them like a mist finding its way through the jungle just after a rain.Xavier had become a keen observer to the maturation of this type of control.They could introduce an element like chaos to dictate a reaction.The energy for this flowed into lawlessness, and he was surprised at how easily they could apply it to a situation.It was like a deli mustard to a burger, only here the condiment put a little extra distance between the population and the law.Lawlessness wasnt just a condition of deteriorating social standards, it could be planned for, it became an applied concept.Modern military forces used this tactic to perfection as they channeled where the fight should take place.They denoted the zones of safety and those of conflict, and they telegraphed where the opposition should gather to prep for a fight.If everyone knew where the fight was taking place then everyone would spend time gearing up for battle.The soldiers went in with guns a blazing, and that meant those combatants were also carrying themselves with an overwhelming sense of impunity.DARK SHADOWS OF HUBRIS The word struck Xavier as being funny, impunity seemed to be such an awkward term, its etymology felt derived from the slurring speech of a drunkard.When he took a moment to think about the word, he actually saw it take shape in his mind and transform into color, it started out in wispy shapes of white, blending into pink then green then back to white, only to be quickly muted at the end of the word into a darker shade of brown.Left by itself, it was one of those words that seemed useless and without explanation, and that of course was laughable, because nothing on Mars could ever be viewed as useless.Yet in complete contradiction to such an idea there stood Harvard.You neednt justify your actions with me.I am really uninterested in the particulars of your mode of operandi.Unless of course this is a confession, some sort of admittance of guilt.Harvard paused just long enough for Xaviers silence to be his rebuttal.Thats what I thought, so lets not waste each others time and get down to brass tacks shall we?Xavier was shocked by what his assistant had just told him.It was obvious they had been working together for far too long now.The assumptions he just heard about his character were nothing short of damning, exposing ones lies shined an uncomfortable light on the soul.Normally he would have sent angry verbal shots across the bow of the person having done this.There would have been hell to pay for crossing a line like that, but this was Harvard.Xavier felt his demons begin to reveal themselves.They gained confidence as they always did when he locked himself in this room.They traipsed through his fields of thought, viciously slid down his vines of integrity, and recklessly flew through the rich creamy clouds of hope.Xavier carried thoughts of impunity with him all the time, it was at the ready like long belts of bullets draped over his chest.He was almost white knuckled with the effort of holding himself back from acting out on his impunity.The company should have been smarter about how they had prepped the colonists, they should have warned them, trained them to take on more responsibilities for saving themselves.The very minute he decided to lash out, he would be merciless in his efforts, targeting things along the industrious landscape, rifling it with a vengeance of what he felt was clearly owed to him, and the way he saw it those old men back on Earth owed him a lot.If they could have somehow read his treasonous thoughts, then it would have revealed a corporate leader having gone rogue.It was right out of a theater of the macabre, they would have held their collective breath and watched in horror, waiting for the day a leader like Xavier stepped out from the dark shadows of his own hubris.The audience would have demanded the curtains be drawn back in that odeum, waiting wide eyed for their villain to enter the main stage.If he were to step out from behind those curtains, to let them see what he had really become, a ruthless leader crowned in jewels of the self ordained, they would have been appalled.This haunting reveal would give them a place to put the crosshairs, and there was no way Xavier wanted to be painted in that type of light.The concept of lawlessness only worked if it didnt have a head.Once it became apparent there was someone in charge, then lawlessness lost its helter skelter texture and became something else, like anarchy that was followed by a coo, or the street crazed riot that was followed by a seizure of power.Even the mob came into focus once everyone knew who the boss was.Harvard was watching intently, waiting for Xavier to mentally slip up.You cant keep going on like this forever.You have spent a lot of time insulating yourself from those around you.Well my friend isolation isnt the answer.Modern penal systems back on Earth are littered with documented cases of prisoners who have slowly lost their minds locked away in isolation.Receptors demand to be engaged.The mind begs for human interaction, it craves conversation and expression.When it gets those things, it actually induces a process of self healing.It takes a lot to kill the social creature lurking deep within us, but if one goes out of their way to do just that, cognizance is soon to follow.They go hand in hand.If you stay in here long enough you will lose your mind.POSSIBLE TRUTHS You find the most incessant gibberish to ramble on about.I dont have time for it.Find something else to have a conversation about or leave me alone.Anytime you dont want to talk about a subject, you always act annoyed.This time I will not be so easily dissuaded.You cant have walked the halls of this place for this entire time ignoring the faces of those you have passed.They are doing everything they can to eke out an existence up here.Their desolate lives have become the muddy pools of despondency.Its murkiness can only reflect the shattered image of a distorted persona.If one stares long enough into that gloom, they will begin to disengage entirely from reality, falling through a penumbra of mephitic whispers down into a well filled with destitute souls.It is a mental state of isolation unlike anything a person should ever have to experience.The sediment is so thick down there one can actually forget themselves within the layers of it.You know this kind of dirt better than anyone, dont you?It is a rich black silt.This kind of sediment conveys a message to people about the stagnation of time, and you are covered in it, much like a primitive person embraces their oneness with the Earth, only in your case, you have embraced Mars.Harvard was beginning to warm up to his chances.He crossed the room slowly, approaching Xaviers desk as if he were a cutter trying to make his way through glacial ice, with its only goal making it back out onto the high seas.Its funny, a person can conceal their indignation, shelter their extreme beliefs, or put a veil on imprudent proclivities, but a thing like hardship is worn on the faces of every individual who has ever had to travel down its insensitive path.Stop it!Stop treating it as a struggle between us and them.All of us up here are trapped in our own little hardships, and for most of us, we accept it.Its a better place because of that acceptance!I dont see it that way.Of course you dont.Xavier murmured it under his breath in disgust.He was holding the top of his head with both hands.How much longer would he have to endure Harvard as an assistant?He had swore to himself he would be replaced with the first capable person.People yearn to be free, but its not about the technologies that are sheltering them, keeping them alive.They need their space suits, rovers, and biospheres.The real problem they have is with the Dextoids.People want to be free from the yoke these unblinking machines exude.This almost made Xavier laugh.Why not wish for the planet to have an ocean, or how about oxygen in the atmosphere?None of those things are going to happen anytime soon either, these creatures are unsurpassed in their safety record.Companies rely on these Dextoids for their documentation skills.Their testimony has been irrefutable in every case they have been used in.Their very existence has been proven to be invaluable to this entire process.I didnt expect you to tow anything but the company line, but surely you have heard the rumors.They speak of injuries and fatalities, of human suffering and pain, and of people crying out for help as Dextoids diligently watch over them.These things are failing to react; they are failing to help people.They are failing to do their jobs.There is no proof behind such stories.They are rumors people are spreading, they find their way into the biospheres on the breath of liars.They are nothing more than tall tales, the substance of urban legends.I think those rumors persist because deep down inside people fear what those possible truths could hold for them.They arent sold on the record of perfection the company is trying to shove down their throats.You said it yourself, the company spends a lot of time trying to convince us things are all right.We have no crime, we are supposedly happy in our existence, the Dextoids are our saviors, its all rubbish.You would know better than I when it comes to those facts, but if the companies are lying about the reliability of Dextoids, if they are padding their statistics, or inflating their numbers on safety just to make these inhabitants feel safe, then these colonists are in more jeopardy than anyone could have possibly imagined.Harvard saw the stunned look on his bosses facehe had caught Xavier in a trap by using his own words.He pushed the topic a little further.Dont look so stunned.You are right in one respect, these people are talking, and you should be worried.They are beginning to use the isolation they are feeling to their advantage.Those furtive little rendezvous are about finding their own cliques.They are forming into groups, galvanizing into packs.Think about it, arent those the same type of actions that always precede a mutiny?What?Are you saying these people are planning a mutiny?You have heard those very words?No, I think the conditions are forming for such a thought to take hold and be put into action.I dont think it will happen tomorrow, or even next month, but if you keep pushing them, it will happen.It was with this last statement Xavier had to smile.If what Harvard was telling him was the truth, then the conditions were right for his plan to hatch.All of his hard work would finally be paying off.The government, the Alliance, the corporation, they had been applying a squeeze to the colonists for some time now.It was pushing them away from this system, having them wanting change.It had always been his fertile hope they would do something as primitive as run with the pack.There was safety in their numbers; it called on each to be ruthless.He knew a thing like their cautionary tale would have them falling back onto the strength of the group.Like the keyboard of a piano, the keys may have looked the same but each produced its own note, their strength came when played together.Now Xavier had them!There were syndicates and crews, mobs and gangs, posses and hordes, if one traced them back far enough along the timeline, they would have found each of those groups had branched out from just one single solitary pack.He could not help but paint for himself the heroic vision of what that first pack must have looked like, of those savage people doing everything they could to survive in the face of monumental adversity, drenched to the bone by a violent rain storm, and all the while emanating a stance of condescending barbarism.This was the hallowed image hanging in his head, a mural of maudlin proportions, richly caked in the heavy oils, every last little brush stroke interlacing with the other to form a construct in which all of humanity would come to life and survive.It was an ideal, a painting created in the confines of his mind and it was every bit worthy of hanging next to the colorful model displaying the intricacies of the human genome.The truth was probably far less vibrant than Xaviers imagination evoked.The real picture had been slightly muted over the stretches of time, to the point of being achromatized.In real life that pack loosely huddled together, crouching in the pouring rain.They probably flinched at the first loud clap of thunder.There wasnt any heroic imagery one could attach to that type of despair, and the feelings one got from looking at this pathetic sight were closer to a guilt ridden crime of in flagrante delicto.Still there was something that drew Xavier back into always trying to find this dark primitive hallow.He stirred with the thought of being caught romanticizing an idea like this, and lashed out at Harvard immediately.What would you have me do?Shine a light into every dark corner of this place, remove the doors of every pod and bay?Have people followed just so we can listen in on their conversations?They are going to do what they want to do, you cant stop them!Xavier ended with a deadpan stare, as if he were somehow still putting energy into trying to find that primitive hallow.Harvard wouldnt budge.Dont under estimate what is happening out there.It is the pack, and they are gathering their ideas to become a force.The situation is being monitored to the best of our capabilities.The Dextoids are out there, they are watching, listening, and monitoring the situation.Perhaps it is not they, but me they should not underestimate.SHATTERED PERCEPTIONS Harvard was thrown off guard by Xaviers last comment.He had just interjected something about himself into the conversation.The comment wouldnt have disturbed Harvard if it werent so reptilian in nature.That was it, this was Xavier!The bastard seemed to have the ability to slither away at the first sign of serious trouble, only to come back and fight on another day.The human mind was equipped with too many cautionary tales to think they had all come from the cognitive experiences of their participants.People needed a thing like fear for the sake of their own survival.How else were they to warn future generations about the world around them, especially when early humans were living for a total of twenty or thirty some odd years?It was the cautionary tale being passed onto their young that was allowing them to feel that chill down the back of their spine, or at the ends of the hair on the nape of their neck.They needed to know when to turn and run.This had to be why phobias existed.How else were deep rooted fears making their way into the minds of deductive people?Look at the lizard, it needed to be able to identify the passive food sources from the aggressive ones.Things like grasshoppers and caterpillars were easier to catch and looked much different from insects like scorpions or spiders.Arachnophobia could have found its genesis in a creature like a lizard.They watched at ground level the spindling agitation of these eight legged arachnoids, at times feeling their venomous bite, or the sharp, pin prick sting of the scorpion.This window of opportunity wouldnt stay open forever.Xavier rarely let his guard down.Harvard had to say something to continue pushing this energy forward, with out being so obvious that Xavier would shut himself down.Are you trying to imply a touch of mysticism to this situation?Leave it to you to penalize the person for wanting to ponder.Sure, I am questioning things, only because everything here is not solely as it seems.The surfaces of our worlds only contain the things we are allowed to see.Look at the bruising they have seen in the background radiation of our universe, arent those the telltale signs of our walls bumping up against those of another?The proof of such a find would boggle the mind.Why point a telescope at a thing like a star but refuse to put time into understanding the darkness around it.Dark matter, dark energy, gravity, no one anticipated their connection, but these things exist on multiple plains.You cannot touch it, and you cannot see it per se, but you can certainly feel their affects.You are trying to attach a mysticism too this!Hah!Well you wont find any dark energy moving people in that way around here.Individuals challenge themselves in ways we dont always understand, but they are rooted in the here and now.People will always adapt and find ways to fit in with their surroundings.Look at how primitive people took the time adapting to the world around them.They reached within themselves to find a belief in overcoming their own fears.Its obvious from even the earliest of cave paintings how much they revered and admired the healthy beasts that were all around them.Even after they hunted them down and killed them, they still paid their respects to those creatures, to the point of wanting to take on their attributes.Why else would they have worn their furs, made good use of their horns, or ingested them so gratifyingly?Xavier could see through the veil of his argument, he knew Harvard was talking about the corporation.The company was leaving nothing to chance, layering their ideology in cultural metaphors, hiding morality in corporate policy.The reassurances the colonists were given were written like bad checks from an overdrawn account.When it came right down to it the company didnt have a thing to honor, but it fully expected to be honored by each and every individual.Their fate was complete as soon as they arrived.People will adapt, I think you are implying the company expects a matriculation by them into the corporate fold.And youre going to sit there and tell me it doesnt?We dont have lines out our front doors to get into this place, but we do have food lines, fuel lines, supply lines, lines for transportation, lines to get into the banks, lines for our medical exams, and lines of communication with the outside world.We have lines, and they are regulated and watched very carefully by this corporation.If given the chance, they would program people much like they program the Dextoids.Isnt that what this is all about, having control over things without openly showing it?He leaned on the desk, putting both his hands on the paperwork.His next words were whispered as if he knew someone else might be trying to listen in on their conversation.There are rumors of implants having been installed into a certain group of people.It is horrifying if they can prove it to be true.It would mean they have started something up here, which has accelerated the obligation the company will expect from these colonists.We both know that agenda, dont we?The people that have gone under the knife for this have given up something about themselves, and are no better than lab rats.Xavier felt his head beginning to spin.It really hurt.The thing that was growing inside his head feared being exposed.Harvard was supposed to be his friend, his go to guy and confidant, but for some reason, today, he seemed to be anything but.Why was this happening?It was all so confusing.Perhaps his friendship with him was based in obligation.Everything else up here seemed to be dipped in that word.What was it about people wanting to control the things around them?If they could do it, some would reach out and try to control the world.Control was the bane of mankind; it was the unannounced dream of human beings to want to have a sheer mastery over nature.Science had its epochs, its moments when they felt they were on the verge of understanding everything.The telescope, the microscope, all of their esoteric math tried to bring their world into focus.Every time they got close to achieving this, the universe revealed a little more of its mysticism.THE EXCEPTION Xavier knew he was about to shatter some perceptions of his own.The investors backing this project had pushed him to his absolute limit.From this point on he was refusing to budge another inch for them.He hadnt informed anyone of his decision.If he had his druthers though, he would have flown all the way back to Earth and punched Jeb Wentworth square in the face before handing them his resignation.Those greedy old men had taken the expectation levels of this place and wrapped it around his neck as if it were some sort of tight fitting horse collar.The device was maligned with constraints that would all but choke him off, things like corporate responsibility and gross profit filled its leathers.He had become their beast of burden and they expected him to go out and plow the fields each and everyday of his troubled existence.They also expected him to do this without complaint.All the promises he had heard while on Earth for obtaining a wealth beyond his wildest dreams didnt matter, not if they had sent him here with every intent of being marooned.There wasnt one choice they made about the corporation that didnt seem to affect who he was, or have an influence on what he could become.Xavier had gone well past the point of depression, and was now feeding on an underlying current of anger that would become a mainstay of his persona.If one were able to glance into the viewing portal of his soul, it would have revealed a blistering bedrock of dark marbles, each one a polished representation of the hatred he had developed for this place.The corporation came to represent his labyrinth, and those aphotic corridors became the tunnels to his nightmares.No matter which way they turned, they would always bring him back to the same place.He was lost in some gigantic industrious machine, with monstrous cogs and leavers thunderously making their revolutions.It flung grease and grime as if those cogs were the arms of some deranged artist who was insistent on throwing his paints.Their loud clanking and grinding had the distinct sound of things approaching him and then rapidly going by, as if it were the blaring horn being sounded from a passing train.Xavier was trapped inside this machine, and it seemingly went on forever with no possible way out.After awhile he forgot what the machine did, what it produced, what purpose it really served.His only task was to keep it working.The machine of his nightmares became his own personal iron horse, and into it he shoveled the hatred of those volatile dark marbles.Harvard stood there, almost frozen in time, as if he were having an out of body experience.He was able to observe himself and Xavier as they went through their motions.In that moment he saw the paperwork sitting on Xaviers desk.The mess itself looked to be a strong argument for the cosmological constant; it was an indefeasible flow of pulp.He wondered at times what the advent of computers had really done to make things paperless.Even here on a planet like Mars, where not a single forest existed, there theoretically stood a stack of paper higher than all the structures they had built to date.In the entire universe, was there even one civilization that could stand up and proudly proclaim they had freed themselves from the flow of paper because of their use of computers?He personally doubted it.Xaviers world had become a stack of memos.They were waiting for him morning, noon, and night.Harvard stared at the stack knowing full well that somewhere in this pile of papers contained the evidence he was so desperately looking for.He shifted his weight slightly moving over them, casually placing his hand on the pile.He needed a way to find this proof.Seems as if no matter what we do, we are never going to be viewed as anything more than soldiers of fortune in their influential little army.There isnt one solution to any of these situations that doesnt have a certain amount of greed attached to it.If a line ruptured and spewed its crud into the ocean, then siphoning off as much as possible before capping the well would always be apart of the fix.That type of greed contaminates everything it touches.If there is going to be something that motivates the effort to colonize this place, why cant it be greed?Why do we need to act as if we are above all of this, as if we have higher morals than everyone else?The credits we earn are not evil; weve worked hard for them.If they offered us more, we would take them.Xavier was beginning to feel a serious sensitivity to this situation, perhaps because there was one thing in those stacks of papers that made him feel uncomfortable.It revealed more about who he was than he really wanted anyone else to know, and from all indications Harvard looked to be trying to close in on them.The corporation had been on a mission.It was rumored they wanted to see all of their top tiered people receiving cerebral upgrades.He had the initial procedure done back on Earth, and at that time, he thought he would always be working there.The prep work for such an operation took an entire year.It left bothersome scarring on the back of his head.He often wondered how many others were having this same procedure done?Were they having problems like extended scarring?Anytime he received paperwork on this subject, it would only have his name attached to the document.There was no real way for him to know how many others were actually involved in the program.The Dextoid caring for him never spoke publicly about who else might be involved, and Xaviers searches on the subject turned up zero leads.All he knew was they had selected him for this process.The surgical follow ups were completed on Mars.He had requested his personal Dextoid be allowed to complete the operations.They had assigned him a contact back on Earth he could speak with if he had any issues, but communicating in that way didnt sit well with Xavier at all.At times he hated himself for committing to this process.When one of their memos came across his desk asking for him to go in for a checkup or an upgrade, it almost always caused him to freeze in his tracks.They claimed the process would help improve his memory, amplify his intelligence, and enhance the longevity of his life.Given all those benefits, how could anything go wrong?Still, it seemed rather unpleasant to think there was something foreign growing inside his head, invading his mind like a cancerous cell, and spidering out into the smallest pockets of his lobes.What they had grafted within him was alive, he was sure of it.He could feel it, and the feeling was anything but comforting.Blast those doctors back on Earth.All the reassurances and guarantees they gave him about not being able to feel a thing were a lie.He was stuck, there was no turning back, and he would always need to show them he was fully committed.Maybe there is something more...Harvard allowed his thumb to travel down a corner of the stack, peeling back the pages and letting them feather rapidly out of his grasp.to what they are allowing to happen up here?Xavier felt inhibited; there was a sickness in the pit of his stomach from all this questioning.His implant was driving this feeling.It recoiled at being disturbed.Since it had taken hold, there were weird little things beginning to transpire within the background of his mind.He heard a monophonic hum; sometimes it could even be described as an annoying buzz.Even more disturbing to his sensibilities was when these noises turned into scratching little sounds of whispered voices.As if a secret language was being spoken just beyond his reach.His mind would slowly bubble over with the frustration in having to deal with his own personal arcanum.This had to be why they kept demanding he go under the knife, again, and again, and again.There was something wrong with the implant, they just werent telling him.Harvard leaned in again, giving Xavier the sternest of looks.There are just too many layers of secrecy attached to this process, arent there?Too many things they dont want people to know or admit too.If you were to speak up about anyone of them, they might send you back like Johnston, probably lock you away forever.The room felt as if it were beginning to osculate.His fallibilities were becoming stretched and mutated as if the inner workings of his conscious mind had become a pliant thing.Xavier braced himself for the onslaught of discomfort he was sure would come.The methodology they were insisting on for this cerebral procedure lacked any type of compassion, right down to the part where corporate insisted his Dextoid report to them on the status of his follow up procedures.Who the hell was it reporting too?!Harvard leaned in on those stack of papers, getting a little closer to what he was trying to find.Yes, you know it as well as I do, what they are doing isnt just wrong, its evil.Its down right sinister.Who can you really trust?Who can you tell?Harvard was mocking him!How on Phobos could he know?This damn thing in his head was blurring the lines of his sanity.It was wrecking havoc with his reason, and he had reason to believe there was no getting around his current conundrum.He was frustrated by the whole affair.It was obvious to him they were attempting to fix something they did not fully understand.Xavier had quit calling his contact back on Earth and eventually had his Dextoid destroyed for very good reasons.He wanted desperately to go back to his calming vision, to the ledge and peaceful state of the water droplet.Instead he was delivered to a place of twisted logic, a mired bog, filled with anesthetized souls.From its brine rose a vapor of chilling motivation found only in the most savage hearts of men.He was at the point in his life where the road map had stopped.No one documented their fall from the cliff that was their sanity.He wanted to be free.Free enough to abandon the unhinged marathon he was on.He felt tired in his being.He knew what he wanted, and to get it he was going to have to make a stand.This then was why people drove the sledgehammer so squarely onto the spike.This was why people fenced off open spaces of land.Those explorers had traveled far for what they wanted, and when they finally had a chance to make a claim, they drove their stakes firmly into the ground.Those metal poles outlining their estates represented so much more than the boundaries of a property, they marked the edge of civilized thought, and people were always up for that type of challenge, and not just to make it all the way out to where those stakes were driven, but to go well beyond them.Xavier thought about the stakes he had gone out of his way to drive into the ground up here on Mars.
