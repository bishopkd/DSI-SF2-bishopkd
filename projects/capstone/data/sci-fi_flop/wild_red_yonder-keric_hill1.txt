Cliff noticed distant tufts of murk passing slowly overhead through his view out the cockpit window.Then a masked face appeared in the window, startling him.Mabok turned and saw the same person, waving from outside.He had a dark suit, a large clear visor over his eyes, and a breathing mask that covered his nose and mouth.An air hose led down to his chest, where it split into several hoses that went to air tanks on his back and chest.He looked a lot like a scuba diver.Mabok held up four fingers, and the man held up a fist and nodded.He disappeared from sight.A minute later, Cliff heard the pumps working in the airlock.Jeff called the others on the intercom and told them that everything was all right.Eventually the top hatch opened.Cliff looked through the small window in the hatch and saw the man climb into the airlock, and then a woman followed him.They closed the top hatch and turned on the pumps again.Finally the hatch opened into the cockpit and the man walked into the cockpit.The woman stayed inside and was working some controls in the airlock.Mabok smiled and greeted him, and the man smiled back, removing his air mask.Now Cliff could see his face better, and this man was not as blue as Mabok.His space suit was not like the big, blimpy things that the men from Earth were used to, but a thick one piece suit that covered the entire body except the face.It was slick on the outside and looked somewhat like a wetsuit.The mans smile turned to a look of surprise as he noticed Gavin."Gavin!"he exclaimed excitedly in English, "Glad to see you again.The Jaka brought some more of your kind?"he asked as he pointed to Cliff."Well... "Gavin said, hesitating."You know English!"Jeff said."Yes," the man answered, "I learned it from Gavin when he was with the Jaka. "He glanced back and forth at the three astronauts."You Reds all look the same!""To tell the truth," Gavin said, "Mabok didnt bring me.We brought Mabok with us.This is our ship now and we are leaving him here with you.We dont want any trouble.It was all part of an agreement with Mabok.""I see," the man said in Purple Man language, looking troubled."I am Gefron, and this is Palla," he said pointing to the woman in the airlock."I have no quarrel with you, because Im not a Jaka myself.However, I dont think stealing one of their ships was very smart of you.""It doesnt matter now," Mabok said, "Lets go to the base.""Yes," Gefron said in English, "We brought suits with us so you could go outside of your ship. "Gefron pointed to a large box he had carried inside the ship, and several air tanks."We have our own suits," Cliff said, picking up his helmet."Those wont work here, Red," Gefron said with a frown."The atmosphere at this level is a liquid, and the pressure here at the surface is intense.Regular suits would be squashed flat."Gefron helped the four men into the strange suits and soon Cliff, Gefron, and Palla were in the airlock.The others had to wait their turn.Gefron started exchanging the air inside with the liquid outside.Yellowish plumes billowed out from the vents in the wall, and the airlock took on an orange tint.The liquid from outside was cold, and Cliff was relieved that the suit was so thick and warm.The pressure began to build higher.It felt like he was in the bottom of a swimming pool and they had to clear their ears.Finally, Gefron opened the hatch and Gefron and Palla climbed up the ladder and out of the airlock.Cliff followed them out.He was very buoyant, and almost floated  instead of climbed  out of the hatch.As he looked around the dark yellow sky he noticed that the visibility extended only a few hundred yards.Gefron and Palla slid down the side of the hull to the ground.Cliff just stood on top for a while, gazing around the horizon."Lets get going," Gefron called from the ground on an intercom."Right," Cliff answered.He closed the hatch and started down the handholds on the side of the ship, but found it easier to float off of them and slide down the side.He hit the ground gently, and then followed the other two.The ground was smooth with low rolling hills.Any rocks that Cliff saw on the surface of the dirt were rounded and smooth.They entered a tunnel that led into a dome about thirty feet high and as wide as a large building.There was another airlock at the end of the tunnel, and this time they had to wait inside the airlock for only a few moments."How did you learn English?"Cliff asked."Gavin and several other Reds were brought here on the way back to the homeland," Gefron explained."We were heading back to the Jaka home also, so we were able to travel together and share languages.""I have heard," Palla added, "that we were the only Hadrans that were able to talk to the Reds before they reached the Jaka nation.After that, the Reds were immediately taken back with the colonist ships to help with translation.""Do you know Gavin well?"Cliff asked."No," Gefron answered, "we mostly talked to a Red more familiar with the sciences.""We were going to stay at the Jaka nation," Palla said, "But we decided to leave and come back here.""We wanted to learn some of the science and learning of the Jaka," Gefron said, "and that is why we wanted to go there.However, the Jaka are a very proud people.They feel like they are the superior race of the galaxy, and we did not feel comfortable with them.""We didnt get along very well with them either," Cliff said."This is a science station," Palla said, "So all people are welcome.A Hadran supply ship arrived earlier, and the crew is inside.Gefron and I would be willing to translate if you would like to talk to them.""Well probably just stay here long enough to drop Mabok off."The airlock was done depressurizing, so Gefron opened the door and they walked inside the dome.The walls were white, and rooms lined the outer edge of the dome.Gefron and Palla took off their wetsuits and hung them on the wall.Underneath, they wore clothes like the ones Mabok wore.However, theirs were simpler and didnt have military patches.Cliff took off his wetsuit also.Once their masks and suits were off, Cliff got a better look at the Purple Men.Gefron and Palla had quite a different look to them than Mabok and the Jaka who had come to earth.They had sharper features and darker hair.Gefron was quite old and had a little gray hair.His face was lined.Neither of them had as much of the blue color to their skin as Mabok, but they were very pale looking.Palla was the first Purple woman that Cliff had seen and she looked much more friendly than all of the others he had met so far.***In the middle was a circular commons area.Ten Purple Men were sitting at tables talking.Cliff figured that they were the Hadrans Palla had mentioned."Wait there," Gefron said, pointing to the commons area, "While the others arrive.We are getting a transmission, so I must go. "Gefron went into one of the rooms and Cliff sat at a table at the outer edge of the commons area, trying to escape notice."Hey you!"someone said to Cliff from across the room.Five of the men walked over.Cliff smiled weakly.He wished Gavin and Jeff would hurry up and get here.The men stood around him, pointing to his face and hair and talking to themselves.They sat down around Cliff and patted him on the back.Soon they were talking among themselves and eating food that looked a lot like the soup Cliff had been eating on the ship.One of the men turned to Cliff and blurted out a strange sentence, and all of them turned to look him in the face.They waited for a response, but Cliff didnt have one."They want to know if you came from a rocky, or a gas world," Palla said from behind Cliff.She sat down next to him."They have a bet going.""Rocky," Cliff said.Palla acted as translator as they continued to talk.Several of the men smiled and laughed and the other three handed over some objects out of their pocket."You are from Earth, right?"one asked through translation."Yes, thats right," Cliff answered."I guessed as much," the man said, "You are a Red.I have heard about you.""Really?""Yeah, savages.""I guess some of us are," Cliff said."I am Denz," the Hadran said."Nice to meet you, Denz.""It is too bad that you will always be prisoners to the Jaka out here in the void.I think you would get along with the Hadrans.""We arent prisoners here," Cliff said."The Jaka brought you, right?""No, we came in our own ship," Cliff answered, pointing outside."The ship that just landed is a Jaka Pinak, isnt it?How did you get a Jaka Pinak?""We took it.""Pirate, huh?Listen, Red, were supposed to kill pirates on sight.But," Denz said with a smile, "We wont kill you.It takes a brave man to be a pirate out here.The Jaka seek your blood, the people wont trade with you for fear of being arrested, and you have no ones pity.Pirates are scum of the lowest.""Were not pirates," Cliff protested.Denz didnt even wait for Pallas translation of what Cliff said, he just continued.Palla shrugged and relayed his words to Cliff."I should have figured that the only pirates I met would be Reds.No one else has the guts anymore."Denz got a faraway look in his eyes."If only I had a ship without the government contract to bind me down.Do you realize whats out there?Jaka treasure ships with riches beyond your imagination.Jaka transports loaded with goods and slaves, just waiting to be taken by an adventurous soul.The lost treasure of Seebol.Ah, yes, Seebol," Denz said with a smile.The Hadran stopped talking and looked at Cliff, coming back to reality."I envy your life, Red man, may you live long enough to enjoy it."The Hadran downed the rest of his drink and turned to leave.At that moment, Gavin, Jeff, and Mabok walked up and sat down."Amazing planet," Gavin said."Yeah," Cliff answered."Ill be glad to go home, though," Jeff said.Gefron walked up to them."I hope that wont be for a while," he said."I am very interested in learning more about you Reds.You are invited to stay in the dome for a while and we can exchange information."Gavin and the other Reds looked at each other."I would love to stay here for a while," Cliff said.Jeff shrugged in agreement.Gavin turned to Gefron, "We would like to stay," Gavin told him, "but we will have to ask the rest of our crew first. "Gefron nodded."Ill go ask the men," Cliff suggested."Fine," Gefron said, "Palla can go with you to show the way."Cliff and Palla left the group."Gavin," Mabok said, "I would like to tell you more things about the Pinak before you go, since I will be staying here.Also, Gefron will help me explain, since he knows spaceships much better than I do.""Sure, Mabok," Gavin said as he stood up, "Lets find a quiet room somewhere."Gavin and Mabok got up to leave.Jeff and Gefron followed after them.Palla and Cliff began to suit up to exit the dome."So, what is your name, Red?"Palla asked."Cliff.""That word means something like rock wall, right?""Thats right.""Well, my name, Palla, means cloud.""The clouds here are beautiful.Were you born here?"Cliff asked."No," Palla answered, "I was born on the planet Hadra. "Cliff tried to connect a hose to his air mask but couldnt get it to fit."Put it on the other side," Palla suggested."Thanks," Cliff said, "So what is Hadra like?""Near the equator it is very hot and it is extremely cold at the poles.It is much different than Jaka.The Jaka world is cold all over.""I would be great to see them both," Cliff said.Palla smiled at him, "I hope you can someday."They climbed into the airlock and turned on the intercoms in their air masks."What is your planet like?"Palla asked."It is very beautiful.," Cliff explained, "There is always something new to see.There are mountains and rivers.Some places are teeming with plants and animals, and others are quiet and barren.""Hadra does not have plants or animals," Palla said as they climbed out of the airlock into the cold, viscous liquid.It was like standing underwater in the ocean."Only the Jaka world has life, not my planet.""How do you survive there?"Cliff asked."We must carry air with us," Palla said as she led Cliff to the end of the tunnel and to the edge of the soft sand.Cliff looked towards the distant Pinak."So you must wear space suits?""No, thank goodness," Palla said with a laugh, "Only an air mask when we are outside. "As they walked along the ground, Cliff paused to look around him.The yellow liquid swirled with low clouds and a red glow came from the sky where the sun was hidden.The soft sand was broken by staggering rock formations that came into sight when they got close enough to see them."This planet is amazing!"Cliff gasped as he took it in.Palla smiled behind her mask."All of the Purple Men say that it is ugly and desolate, especially the Jaka.""How could they say that, Palla?This is beautiful.Look at this!""The Jakas idea of beauty is different than yours.To them, a beautiful sight is a huge city.As for plants, they prefer organized gardens to the random quality of natural growth.Since this planet has no immaculate gardens and no large buildings with pleasing architecture, they don't like it here.They prefer to stay in their cities with plenty of entertainment, music, and noise.They do make the most beautiful cities.I have never seen better than the cities on Jaka. ""How can they not admire a view like this?"Cliff gestured around him with his hands."Well, I guess they are usually more worried about controlling their environment.This planet is dangerous.There are storms that could destroy our outpost in a heartbeat.It's only a matter of time before some disaster strikes here.The Jaka don't like that.Why spend time out here where someone could get killed when they can watch movies of the most beautiful parts of this planet on a screen at home?After all, looking at the stars or clouds is much more boring than watching a video of the same thing.""I am not that way," Cliff said, "I love to see the sky.""I am like you, but the Jaka aren't," Palla said, then paused for a moment."Why did you come out into the void?""Ive always wanted to see what is out there beyond the horizon.I dont know why.Its just something inside me.I just want to explore new places.""Cliff," Palla said, "I want to ask you something, and dont laugh. "Cliff turned and looked at her."Cliff, there is something amazing about being out here.The planets and stars seem to have a personality, like an artist made them.That's silly, though.Everyone knows that they just formed through natural processes. ""Well," Cliff said slowly, "Many of us on my planet believe that these things were made by someone.This someone is an Artist who is wise, loving and in control of this whole universe.Maybe thats why I like to explore.Im studying the work of the master craftsman."Palla looked up at the sky and Cliff saw the dim sunlight reflected in her eyes."If there is a master craftsman out there, Red," Palla said, "I'd sure like to meet him."***Gavin and Gefron looked up from a computer screen to see Cliff and Palla enter the room."So what does the crew say?"Gavin asked."They are willing to stay a few days," Cliff replied, "If they can have some real food here at the base."Gavin looked at Gefron."They will eat the best food we can prepare," Gefron answered, "Well send some men over with wetsuits so they can come to the base."***Wes gripped his knife and fork eagerly as he sat at a table in the commons area in the dome base.He had brought his silverware along, "to be able to eat as fast as possible and not miss any good dishes while I learn to use their weird utensils. "The others were also pretty excited to eat fresh food.The whole crew was gathered around several tables.As soon as Purple Men handed them their trays, they began eating.The feast had barely started when the men were interrupted.Gefron walked up to the men hurriedly."Reds," he said nervously, "You must leave quickly.A Jaka transport is coming in to orbit.They just transmitted a request for landing.""You must go now," Mabok told Gavin."They will kill you.Its too bad you have to leave so soon."Wes groaned, but Cliff was already putting his mask on.Everyone else did the same.They scrambled through the airlock and soon they were running across the tops of the rocks on the way to their ship.Once they got to the ship, it seemed like forever while they waited their turns to use the airlock.Palla had followed them and stood on top of the Pinak making sure that everyone got in.Cliff and Jeff waited for the others and were the last ones outside.Finally, it was Jeff and Cliffs turn to enter the airlock."Okay," Cliff said as he climbed down into the airlock, "Goodbye.""Good luck, I hope to see you again," Palla said before Cliff closed the hatch.Inside the Pinak, Gavin looked around the cockpit nervously.They were going to have to do this without Mabok now.Cliff watched Palla out the window."Okay, Gavin," Cliff said, "Shes got all the suits and shes clear."Inside the bay, the crew was wandering around when Jeff came inside."Everyone take your places.Were taking off now!""Whats up now?"Frank asked as they scrambled around."An enemy ship is coming here to land."***"Open the red valve!"Gavin shouted from the cockpit.Jeff stood at the bottom of the ladder and relayed the order back into the ship."Open the red valve," he called.After Mabok had used the computers to land the Pinak, many of the engine settings were wrong.Gavin and Jeff worked furiously to get them set correctly again."Open the bow tanks!"Cliff flipped switches in the cockpit while men in the kitchen operated valve cranks to open the tanks."Blow the bleed line!""Power the engine.Warm up the maneuvering thrusters!"The ship started humming to life."More power on the maneuvering thrusters!"Gavin called.Gavin and Cliff took their seats."I want all the main engines on five power," Gavin called."All maneuvering thrusters, fire up on full power. "The ship swayed and rose above the ground."A lot smoother than the time we took it in to land," Cliff said with a smile."A lot smoother," Gavin agreed."Main engines on thirty five power. "The ship roared to life and started slicing through the thick clouds."Its kind of sluggish," Cliff said."Yeah," Gavin agreed without looking at him.His eyes were riveted to the controls and the cockpit windows.Gavin flipped some switches.It was some time before the ship broke free of the thick clouds.The Pinak had been laboring upwards for about forty minutes.Then, abruptly, the clouds vanished and the stars appeared.Gavin gave orders to each thruster to trim the controls and ease the Pinak into orbit.They floated up against their seat straps as gravity vanished."Get a lookout up here to watch for that Purple Man ship!"Cliff yelled down.Soon Jose was in the cockpit, fitting his gloves and boots on."Jose," Cliff said, "look out for the other ship and give us a bearing on it.""Right," Jose said, and headed for the airlock."You got your Purple Man numbers memorized?"Cliff called after him."No sweat!""Cliff," Gavin said, "What course do we set for home?"Cliff pulled out some rolled up papers and spread them across the control panel.Drawn in pencil was a complete star chart of the area.Gavin looked at Cliff."Wow," he said, "Thats nice.""Thanks," Cliff said, pleased, "We came on this course here, from that star," he said pointing to the map, "So we should be able to backtrack by heading towards that star again.Thats where the way station is.I have a map to show us how to get home from there.""Good," Gavin said, "What are the coordinates?""Three, seven  ""Gavin!"Wes interrupted from the airlock.He poked his head out."Yeah?"Gavin answered."Have you looked at the fuel tank level lately?"he asked worriedly."No, I  " Gavin stopped when he saw the fuel level on the instrument panel."Oh my goodness," Gavin said, "Were running on fumes!""What are we gonna do?"Cliff asked."We dont have enough fuel get to another planet," Gavin said."We must have used it up in the take off.We dont even have enough to land the ship safely.""Were not in too much trouble if the Jaka ship doesnt see us," Cliff said hopefully.Just then, Jose called over the intercom from outside the top hatch."Ship coming up below us!""That means were in trouble," Gavin said to Cliff, then keyed the mike to talk to Jose."Coordinates?""Uh," Jose hesitated, "Four seven and the other number is one eight five."Cliff looked at the instruments.Those coordinates meant that the ship was coming up from underneath them."Theyll see us for sure, so itll be over one way or the other," Gavin said grimly.Jose watched, as the object grew closer.It was another Pinak type ship.He saw it veer towards them and pull up alongside.Gavin and Cliff eyed it out the window."Looks like a Jaka military ship," Cliff said."Wed better get a gun crew ready," Jeff said."Man the left side gun!"he yelled, "Joe, Frank, take command of the cannon down there!"From outside of the ship, Jose saw a light flashing from one of the other ships cockpit windows."I think its some kind of Morse code," he said over the intercom.Gavin and Cliff saw it out the window."They definitely look like Jaka military to me," Cliff said."Yeah," agreed Gavin, "Lets just pull away from them and hope they go away.""Main engines at 20 power," Gavin called on the intercom.The Pinak edged away from the Purple Man ship.Then the engines sputtered and died."We got a problem here!"a Calvin shouted from below.The Pinak swung in an arc as the last sputters of the engines blasted the ship sideways.Gavin and Cliff tried to regain control."Yaw left!"***The bridge of the Purple Man Pinak was silent as the Purple Men watched the strange ship tumble out of control."They are obviously having difficulties, sir.""Yes, but who are they," said the Purple Man Captain."No other Jaka were supposed to be in the area," offered another man on the bridge."Pull alongside to dock, and have the medical supplies ready.""Yes, sir!"***Gavin and Cliff managed to stop the ships uncontrolled swing, but fuel had run out and they were just drifting.They watched in amazement as the other ship slowly rotated until it was upside down.Then it came alongside their ship.As the Purple Man Pinak came closer, its bay door lined up with the bay door on the Red Pinak and came together with a thud.Jose called up to the cockpit that the other ship had docked with theirs.Everyone on ship ran to the equipment bay.Inside the bay, they found the gun crew ready.The left side cannon was cranked up to the edge of the bay, pointed towards the closed door, and men clustered around it with the tanks and power cable ready to reload.Everyone else stood nearby, watching the door.The engine room had been hot, and some of the men had their shirts off.Several of them wiped sweat off their foreheads."Stay calm!"Jeff ordered.Then the ship lurched a little, and they heard a clanking noise.After another lurch, the bay door started to slide upwards.Onboard the Jaka ship, some medics and a few men stood in their equipment bay, talking amongst themselves while they opened the door.When the door was open, the Purple Men turned in shock to see the large cannon pointed right into their ship.The Reds stood grimly behind it and a Red stared straight at them through the gun sight."These men dont need medical attention!"hissed one of the Purple Man medics as the others stared in amazement.***The Captain of the Purple Man ship stood calmly on his bridge and turned to see a crewman with wide eyes coming up the ladder."There are Reds on board the crippled ship!""Reds, from Earth?"the Captain asked.The crewman nodded."Place them under arrest.How did they get that ship?"The crewman shook his head and opened his mouth a few times, but no words came out.The Captain motioned two of his men to take weapons and follow.Jeff watched warily as a Purple Man officer strode onto the enemy equipment bay.He was walking upside down in relation to himself, so it was quite a strange sight.He noticed that the officer looked important, and several of his men had weapons.Jeff saw his crew fidget a little."Hold your fire!"Jeff yelled.Jeffs command stopped the Captain in his tracks.Jeff saw the Captain look at them in surprise.The men with weapons quickly left them floating in the air and raised their hands in a sign of surrender."Well, Gavin," Jeff said with a smile, "We didnt ask for it, but it looks like theyve surrendered their ship to us.""Take their weapons!"Jeff ordered, and the Reds charged into the enemy bay.Cliff just shook his head."I guess we are pirates now."***Several hours later, all of the Jaka were gathered in the enemy ships equipment bay.Wes and Javier held stolen weapons pointed at them."Wes," Javier whispered out of the side of his mouth, "I dont know how to use this thing!""Dont worry," Wes said, gritting his teeth and grinning evilly at the Purple Men, who shrank back, "I dont either.Just act like you do.""Gavin," Jeff called as he entered the bay from the front of the ship, "This ship is full of supplies.Space suits, guns, weapons, air tanks, food, everything."Gavin nodded and pointed towards the Purple Men."Jeff," he said, "These guys seem scared out of their pants.""I guess we frightened them quite a bit.""Who is your Captain?"he asked in the Jaka language.The Purple Men shifted around until the Captain was visible at the back of the group."I am the Captain," he answered defiantly."What are you doing here?"Gavin asked."I dont have to answer your questions, pirate!"the Captain growled, and then spat."You arent even worth the air you displace!""Im sorry you feel that way," Gavin said."Enjoy your life while it lasts, scum," the Captain said bitterly, "Because when the Jaka fleet gets to your planet, nothing will be left.""Do you think we're scared of that fleet?"Gavin asked."You should be," the Captain replied quickly, "It's the Jaka Sixth Fleet!Im surprised you havent heard of it.It was called the fleet of death by the Hadrans.If you surrender to me now, you might get off with only light labor at a penal colony."Gavin ignored the Captain and turned to Jeff."The Captain just confirmed that a fleet is heading for Earth.""Okay," Jeff answered, "More evidence that Mabok was telling the truth.That might help us get off easy with the authorities at home.At any rate, wed better dump these guys off on the planet.""I agree," Gavin said, "The Captain is too much of a loud mouth for me.Well drop off the prisoners and pick up some fuel for our ship.""Right," Jeff said, "Ill tell the men to get our Pinak ready.Maybe we can pump fuel over to our ship."***The commons area had been quiet for several hours.The Hadrans were still sitting there, talking."He was a good man," Denz said, "the Red we met.""Yeah, too bad.""They have a chance, you know.""Not much against a trained Jaka naval crew.""They have fierce hearts," Denz said."Yeah, Denz, but we all knew that piracy would never pay.It just doesnt work today.You fill your head with too many of the old stories.""They were brave, though.""Look, Gefron is letting in some men through the airlock.A Pinak has landed.""Theyre the Jaka men, probably wanting to celebrate.""Yep, the Jaka alright.Theyll be in an intolerable mood, Ill wager.Cocky as always."The Hadrans stopped talking when they noticed the expressions on the faces of the Jaka Purple Men.They shuffled in to the commons area with a depressed look.Cliff came out from behind the group with a weapon pointed at them.Javier and Jose followed with guns too.Gavin followed."Against the wall!"Gavin shouted.The Jaka lined up obediently with their hands behind their head.Denz leapt up from his seat and grabbed Cliff on the shoulder."You beat them!"he shouted.Cliff didnt understand, but the excitement on Denzs face gave him a hint."You won!Yes!I love it!"He continued jabbering excitedly, while Cliff just nodded.Gefron walked up to them.Denz turned serious and said something to Cliff, holding out his hand."Cliff," Gefron said, "He wants to sign on your ship. "The man still held his hand out.Cliff grabbed his hand and shook it heartily."Tell Denz," Cliff said to Gefron, "that hes welcome aboard. "Gefron translated for Denz, who turned and smiled to the others and laughed.He patted them on the shoulders and ran off to get his gear while his comrades looked on, shaking their heads with doubtful expressions.Palla walked up to Cliff and Gavin."You captured a Jaka ship!"she exclaimed."Now the Jaka are prisoners this time.How ironic.""Yep," Gavin replied, "We hope you dont mind us leaving the prisoners here.Well use the ship we captured from them.""Oh, that reminds me," Palla said, "Jeff just sent us a transmission from the captured ship.He says that it will take him at least 24 hours up there in orbit to get the ship ready.They have to get the engines rigged so that they can fire them manually. ""Well, then," Gavin said with a smile, "We have some time to kill.Ill go talk to Gefron about refueling. "Gavin headed off to talk to the old Purple Man.Palla tapped Cliff on the arm and he turned to look at her."Cliff, there is a spectacular weather pattern moving in.Id like to take you up to get a look at it.I thought you would appreciate the view.""Sure, Palla," Cliff said, but pointed down towards his gun and the Jaka prisoners, "Just as soon as I'm off guard duty."***Cliff headed for the door.When he got there, he found Palla already suiting up.She pointed to a large craft."Well need to take that up," she said."What is it?"Cliff asked as he walked over to it.It was a cross between a motorcycle and an airplane with short wings and handlebars."We can use it to fly to very high altitudes."Cliff put his wetsuit on.As he put it on, he recognized the familiar tangy smell of the outside air.He winced as he caught a whiff."I love the smell of the atmosphere here," Palla said."It might be strange at first, Cliff, but youll get used to it."Palla helped Cliff get on his air tank, and then they lowered their facemasks and stepped into the airlock, pushing the flyer in front of them.Once they came out of the airlock tunnel, Palla flipped a switch.The flyer had a fan on the back that came on with a whir of bubbles."So where are we going now?"Cliff asked as he climbed on the flyer behind Palla."Up," Palla answered with her finger pointing in the sky.The flyer lifted off of the bottom and climbed slowly and steadily through the thick liquid as Palla worked the controls.Cliff glanced down to take a look at the dome below.It was a hundred feet below them now and was starting to get obscured in the yellow light."This is like flying!"Cliff exclaimed.They kept cruising up and up.It seemed to Cliff that they were miles and miles above the surface.Every once in a while Palla throttled back to glide quietly through the murk.Some white clouds came into view as they cruised up."This is awesome!"Cliff said."Yes," Palla replied, "I love coming up here. "Palla piloted the flyer in and out of the smooth clouds as they went up.Cliff ran his hand through the misty edge of one of the clouds and swirls and blobs of white liquid tumbled in every direction.Cliff did it again and looked at Palla with a big smile."You are like a small child!"she laughed.After they passed through the clouds they got closer to a shimmering surface above them.Light filtered through the wavy surface in beams and sparkles.Palla stopped a few feet below it and let the flyer glide."Just wait until you see what is above this layer," she said.She carefully eased the flyer up with the controls.As they neared the layer, it rippled and shimmered and then they burst through.Cliff gasped in the sudden light that he saw above.The air was much clearer and he could see in all directions.The view was only obscured by haze far away.The flyer skimmed along the surface like a boat on water.He reached down into the liquid below and swished it around.Cliff looked down at his wetsuit and saw drops of the darker yellow fluid from below.They sluggishly rolled down his suit in what seemed like slow motion and dripped off until they settled onto the golden brown layer under the sled.The golden brown layer looked like the choppy surface of an ocean.It bobbed and waved back and forth.Up above, in the sky, he could see bright cloudy layers of white that that looked like wavy sheets of cotton."This doesnt happen very often," Palla said as she pointed at the smooth clouds above, "It is usually very turbulent. "Palla held her hand out over the side of the sled and ran her fingers under the golden liquid below them."Instead of a gentle layer here at the surface, it is usually a boiling and churning storm.""This is amazing," Cliff sighed, and leaned back to watch the sky."How often does it happen?""Once every few months or so," Palla answered."It wont last for long.""Thank you for taking me up here, Palla.""Youre welcome."They sat and admired the scene for a while."You know Cliff," Palla began again, "When they first told us about the Reds, they said that you were all savages.They told us stories about how the Reds brutally killed our colonists.Now that I know you better, I know that your people could not have done that.I feel ashamed of the Jaka.They lied again.How could they say that about you?""Palla," Cliff said slowly, "Just because you know me, doesnt mean that you know all of the Reds.Some of those stories are true.""But you and Gavin are not like that.You Reds are good people.""There are good and bad people in every culture.The Reds are not all good."Palla nodded, deep in thought."Palla," Cliff said after a while, "Why dont you come with us and see our world?""I cant, Cliff.Youve stolen two Pinaks and the Jaka will surely try to kill you all.You are in the middle of a storm that is too dangerous for me.I prefer to live peacefully."Palla paused and Cliff lowered his head."But you have to come back and tell me about your world," she said."And maybe one day I can see Earth."Cliff looked around him."Someday there will be a calm in the storm," he said.Palla jumped in her seat as she saw something in the distance."Not now!Look!"she exclaimed.There was a flash in the distance, then another.They were getting closer.Then Cliff saw a streaking crash of lightning between the clouds and the watery layer."We must get down," Palla said.She grabbed the controls.Cliff held on as the flyer sank through the surface with a splash of golden droplets.Light flashed through the shimmering surface above them until the mist blocked it out.***Up in orbit now, Gavin stood in the cockpit of the Pinak.The captured ship, recently dubbed Buccaneer, cruised beside it in formation.Cliff climbed into the cockpit."The Buccaneer has finished pumping in the fuel that we brought up from the surface," Cliff said, "And were ready to fly away.""Good," Gavin said as he looked out the windows at the planets surface.Jeff came into the cockpit and Gavin turned to him."Are you sure you agree with Denz's idea?"Jeff asked."No," Gavin said, "I think he's a little crazy, but he does have a point about delaying the Purple Man attack a little by spreading some havoc behind their lines.""Plus," Cliff added, "considering that we are in big trouble for stealing this ship from the United States, it certainly won't hurt for us to wait to go home until some of the commotion dies down.""I agree," Gavin said, "Weve evenly divided the weapons and equipment?""Yes," Jeff answered, "And the men who want to go home now are on board the other ship.""Who went over to the Buccaneer?"Cliff asked."Sam and Chuck and ten of the others," Jeff said."We now have fourteen, with Denz.They have twelve.I was surprised that Calvin wanted to stay out here with us.""They have copies of Cliffs maps, right?"Gavin asked."Yes.""Good," Gavin said happily."Hopefully theyll be home safe pretty soon.""Tell Denz to give me the coordinates for our first raid, and well power up the engines.""Sounds good to me," Jeff replied."Everyone take your positions!"he shouted.IntroductionIn the list of places on Earth that look like another planet, New Mexico ranks very high.The old sun weathered volcanoes, mysterious caverns, wind swept valleys, and bone dry river beds would look right at home among images of Mars or Venus.Among those who seek to reach the stars, New Mexico seems to have a special allure.After the launch of the first liquid fueled rocket, why else did its inventor feel the urge to move to New Mexico?The discoverer of Pluto chose to live in New Mexico for the rest of his days on Earth.Americas first rocket scientists came from across the planet to start up the American space program in the desert of New Mexico.The first astronaut to see the far side of the Moon decided to settle down in New Mexico.Along with all of these people, the only geologist to walk on the Moon was from New Mexico.Some claim that aliens from another world chose Roswell, New Mexico as their first landing site.Could it be that people from across the galaxy saw something special in New Mexico too?After all of the media coverage about the Roswell incident of 1947, it was hard to believe the people who claimed that, once again, UFOs had landed in southern New Mexico.The witnesses of the landings couldnt get anyone of any kind of official capacity to come out to the site.Some who believed in the stories about Roswell came to see for themselves, but were disappointed.The craft that they saw lying in a desert arroyo over 100 miles from Roswell wasnt a saucer.It was a strangely angular craft resembling a submarine.Soon a false rumor went about that little men with large, slanting black eyes had been seen.However, the first man to truly see the occupants of the alien spacecraft didnt even realize it until the next day.Chris Johnson had come to the UFO sight late one night after getting off of work in Alamogordo.He had made a large bet with some friends that the UFO didnt exist.He found the spot by following paper plates taped to road signs.It got dark as he was driving, but he was anxious to get a look at the UFO site, so he kept going.He parked his car among a motley collection of vehicles left there by other UFO seekers.He walked past an RV and followed the footpath that led to the arroyo.The full moon was so bright that Chris switched off his flashlight and let his eyes adjust until he could see the entire countryside.When he got within view of a real spacecraft, he was surprised and also a little angry.He was so sure of winning the bet that he hadnt thought about what he would do if the UFO were actually there.No one else was at the site, so he walked around the craft to have a close look.In the dark, it was hard to tell if it was real or if someone had built it as a joke.He decided to go back to his car to get some sleep.As he left, he walked backwards to take a few last looks at the ship.When he smacked into something solid, it brought him to his senses.He turned around and saw a person standing in the path, looking annoyed.The man was wearing some kind of jumpsuit."Sorry," Chris said.The man grunted, turned, and walked away."What a rude guy," Chris said to himself as he continued on his way, "I cant stand being around these freaky UFO enthusiasts."The next day, all of the UFO seekers went back to the spacecraft to have a bonfire.They had been waiting by the UFO each day to see what would happen.Chris climbed stiffly out of his car and went to join them.Several of them were dressed up in costumes and Chris thought they were definitely crazy.Chris left the party and went back home, sure that there had to be some logical explanation for everything that was happening.It wasnt until around ten oclock that morning that some of the bystanders noticed that two men sitting at the bonfire hadnt said anything all day.They had on strange jumpsuits and talked in some foreign language."Youre not German, are you?"one bystander said to them, "Sprechen Sie Deutsch?"The jump suited men just stared back."Hey, are you guys alright?"another bystander asked, "You seem awful pale.You didnt sleep out in the cold last night did you?""Do you want anything to eat?"someone else asked.The two men conversed together briefly and then got up from the fire.They left their seats and walked over to the UFO.The two men climbed up some rungs on the spaceship and stood on top.The bystanders were quiet now, and a little confused.Even the most fanatical among them hadnt gotten that close to the spacecraft.These foreigners were audacious!When the two men opened a hatch and climbed inside the UFO, the bystanders were left agape.It took several minutes for the truth to sink into their minds.Those who had come expecting to see aliens that fit the image popular in the tabloids were disappointed."They looked just like us!"one teenager blurted out."They were white as a sheet, though," one said finally."Definitely a little purple looking," another stammered.When a roaring stream of cars pulled into Roswell that afternoon, people finally listened to them.The sheer numbers of witnesses impressed reporters from El Paso and Las Cruces.After all, they couldnt all be high on drugs.The caravan returned the next day, complete with reporters and Deputy Sheriffs.The next day, Chris saw the news.Images of what people were calling the "Little Purple Men" appeared on the screen, and Chris recognized the unique jumpsuits the men were wearing.Chris realized that he had been to first to see one.As the whole planet went into an uproar around him, Chris just sat on his couch in silence.1The calm, blue Kazakhstan sky was sliced in half by the ascending Soyuz rocket.The thundering roar of the Russian rocket engines faded in the distance as the rocket disappeared skyward.On the ground, the Russian control room was tense.American scientists lined the walls and crouched next to their Russian colleagues, watching the monitors.Many looked weary and evidence of frantic work was piled around the room.***On top of the hurtling rocket and inside the cramped Soyuz capsule, the three astronauts waited until it would be time to perform their mission.Radio transmissions from the ground crackled in their headsets as the Earth drifted past their windows."You should have the ship within sight now," a man named Grange called from Earth, "Are you ready to dock?
