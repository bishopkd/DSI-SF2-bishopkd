From an enclave there.He came looking for a new group to work with and found us.And you?She smiles.I was born into it.Like Miranda.I guess.My parents were already part of a science commune when I was born.They taught me as I got older.Did you ever think of, I dont know, not doing what your parents did?Striking off and doing something else?She shrugs, then shakes her head.I dont think I ever did.It just seemed so ...important.That seems odd to me until I realize that I pretty much did the same.Ended up doing exactly what my father did, without ever questioning it.I only ever wanted to be a pilot and a forager.Not that it seemed important.It just seemed ...me.So your people were also looking for a cure?I ask.We were studying the virus, sure.Did you get very far?She looks up at me and for a moment her expression is unreadable.Yes, she says.As a matter of fact, we did.Then its too bad you dont have any of your data.She turns and smiles at me.She taps the side of her head.The good thing about passing down things from generation to generation is that you grow up with it.It gets ingrained in you.A lot of our data is up here.I cant imagine what that must be like, I say.I cant imagine what it would be like without it, she says.She shrugs.At least now I get to use it.Your Miranda is really quite remarkable.She reminds me of someone I used to know.Back at the settlement.Huh, I say.I have to say I consider Miranda to be one of a kind.Oh, of course, Maya says.I just meant her dedication.Shes the one who hired you?Yes.It was something of an accident.But...But?To be honest, I never really thought that Id still be here all this time later.But ...here I am.Are you two?What?I ask it just a little too quickly.She shrugs.The way I hear it, you two are incredibly close.She does things for you.You do things for her.Its clearly more than just a business arrangement.You people talk about this?You obviously werent raised on a science commune.No, I say.Theres always gossip.About whos fucking who.Whod like to be fucking who.I love science, dont get me wrong, but theres much more to life.Makes sense.So ...you and Miranda?Is none of your fucking business.She holds up her hands as if surrendering.Okay, okay.I was just curious.I dont know you people as well as everyone else.I was just curious about the lay of the land.Then it hits me for a moment.Maybe Maya is interested in me.Maybe thats why shes asking.Shes working for Miranda now.She wouldnt want to interfere with any relationship she might be in.That completely makes sense.So of course now Im looking at Maya in an entirely different way.Shes definitely attractive.Thats not why it feels weird.It feels weird because of Miranda.Because of how things have been going.But how have things been going?There was sex, yes, and some kissing, but where does that leave us?What are we to one another?And, more importantly, is that what I want?Something wrong?Maya asks.What?Youre just staring at me with a weird expression on your face.Sorry, I say.Great going, Ben.I was just distracted.She smiles at me.It is a fantastic smile.It cant hurt to get to know her a little, can it?Youre thinking about whos fucking who, arent you?I smile.Or whod like to be.She points a finger at me.Maybe we should compare notes.I think about what it must be like for her, all alone, only one friend with her in a strange place.The rest of their group wiped out.Did you lose anyone?I ask.Back at your lab?Her smile loses some of its humor.No one lasting, she says, her demeanor suddenly shaken.But its okay, she says, bouncing back.She smiles.I think there are always new possibilities.Ah, I think.There just might be.Diegos voice over the speaker breaks into the conversation.Were getting near the location Maya gave me, he says.You better head up here.So we return to the gondola, where Diego is flying and Rosie is helping him.She glares at me as I enter, then looks over at Maya, and I notice something strange in her look.As if shes embarrassed?I dont have much time to focus on it, though, because Maya moves to the gondola window and I follow.There!She points down at the ground, at a large, stone outcropping.See that tree?Next to the outcropping, standing proud, is an old, gnarled tree with a split trunk.Thats where it is.You used the tree as a landmark?I ask.What if it got damaged or chopped down?She looks at me like Im an idiot.Believe me, these days, trees last longer than most other things.Its a fair point.Down on the ground, it really does feel like old times.My life until recently.Here I am, gun out, looking around for Ferals, keeping one eye on my scientist companion, only this time it isnt Miranda.I didnt miss this part as much.And without Miranda it feels strange.The bright spot is that Im not worrying about Mirandas safety, but then this whole venture is for her.To get her supplies.To move her closer to her detection system, ultimately to her cure.We set up a few traps around the entrance, Maya calls.It will just take a moment to disarm them.Huh.Traps.From boffins.I guess that makes sense.It reminds me of what I used to do on the Cherub.What kind of traps?I ask.Mostly bear traps, she says.They work the best in situations like this.A classic, I think.Id help you, but Im too busy looking out for Ferals, I say.Quite all right, she says.Im good with traps.I never realized how attractive it was to hear a woman say that.I move around the perimeter, looking for any signs of Ferals.The good thing is that I dont see any droppings.No tracks or anything.But that doesnt mean we wont attract their attention.Movement.Sound.The airship above us.They all scream out to Ferals.Can you give me a hand?Maya asks.Great, I say under my breath as I move over to where she is.I spare a quick look down and see that shes cleared dirt and grass and leaves from a metal plate set into the ground.Thats where everything is?She nods.Okay.On three.Mayas size means she cant lift too much, but together we manage to lift a corner of the metal plate and slide it to one side.A few pushes opens the gap so that we can get down into the pit they dug in the ground.I pass Maya a pistol, a small automatic.Keep this on you.Well work in turns.So we do.She passes things up to me and I make a pile in the netting that the Osprey has dropped from its cargo hold.I cover her when shes working and she covers me when I am.I admit that Im more nervous when shes covering me.The bright spot is that our back is pretty much up against the outcropping and the land around us is flat enough that we should see anyone or anything approaching.Mirandas going to be happy to see all of this, I say, as I put down a padded case of glassware and a microscope all snug in its own case.This looks like good stuff.Weve been collecting it for years, Maya says.She turns to look at me.Youre really invested in all of this, arent you?I shrug.I guess.I mean youre willing to risk your life for this effort.Well, I hope its not going to come to that, I say.Then, I realized a little while back that surviving wasnt enough.I wanted to help make the world a better place.And you think this is your way to do it?Dont you?I ask.She smiles.And how far would you go for this?The question freezes me for a moment.My inner voice says that Im talking too much to this stranger about private, personal things.But a moment later, I say, As far as it takes.Your life?I pause.Ive never been one for self sacrifice.Ive always protected myself.But ...I gave the Cherub to save Tamoanchan.Almost gave my life.For an island full of strangers.For Miranda, I have no doubt.She may very well go on to find her cure.And me?Well, Im no big loss, right?Im always leaving chaos in my wake.Yes, I say.If it comes to that.Cries echo across the spacehigh pitched and undeniably Feral.Maya looks at me.It just might.Shit, I say, raising my fathers revolver.The netting for the supplies is down, lowered from the Osprey.But the ladder isnt.I wave to Rosie, whos watching above us, to raise the winch.She does, and the line ascends, going taught, then taking the supplies up with it.As it passes my head, I see the first Feral.Over there!I yell, to attract Mayas attention.And then theyre running and were shooting and thats all we can focus on.I count automatically in my head.Twelve of them.Not much room for error.I fire.Three times in quick succession.Three of the moving figures go down.Are you a leg man?she asks.What?I dont look at her.Keep my focus on the Ferals.Some people like to shoot them in the legs.So they go down easy.Lets talk later, say, taking three more shots.Im vaguely aware of Maya shooting next to me.Vaguely aware that her targets are going down.Pretty good shooting for a boffin.Reloading, I call, and move to do so, depending on Maya to cover me.There are, miraculously, only two Ferals left.I quickly load the revolver, only to see Maya shooting down the last two.One chest shot, one neck shot.I look at her as the last one drops.Thats really great shooting, I say.She shrugs.I like to shoot.She sounds breathless.You must, I say.Thats the best Im cut off by something falling on top of me, slamming me to the ground.A second later, I smell what it is, the earthy, dirty, shitsmell of a Feral.Im facedown, and its on my back.Maya!I yell.I feel its grip on my arm and shoulder.Its knees on my back.Maya!Bracing one hand against the ground, I push as hard as I can, coming up and around and throwing the Feral off of my back.It springs to the side, and as I scramble to my feet, Maya puts two bullets into the matted and tangled mess of its head.I stand there, sucking in breath.My chest heaving.I look at her, the still smoking gun at her side.What took you so long?I had to reload, she said.I quickly do the math in my head, and shes right.That Feral had great timing.Check me, I say.That thing was on my back.It might have drooled on me, or bled on me.I turn my back to Maya, and she looks me over.You look clean, she says.But you might want to change your shirt.I nod.Cmon.Lets get up to the ship before any others find us.I signal to Rosie again and the ladder drops.God, shooting gets me so excited, Maya says, slapping me on the arm.I turn and give her a look.Or at least I must because she says, Relax, cowboy.Youre not my type.Really?She gives me a smile and a nod.Yes, sir.Then Maya and I go up the ladder.Of course I send her up first, covering her the way I did Miranda all those times before.Then, sparing one last look around at all the dead Ferals, I follow.Its my favorite kind of exit.SEVENTEEN My good feeling from the run fades a little as I think about quarantine.Yet again.As much as Im in favor of the approach, preventing the Bug from getting in, no one person should have to go through quarantine so much in such a short period of time.Ill be happy to go home, Rosie says.Even if it does mean quarantine again.Diego groans.Dont be such a baby, Rosie says.He turns to her.You like quarantine?She looks out the gondola window.At least its safe.Diego radios down to the ground for instructions, already turning the Osprey toward the landing field near the Orchard.But to our combined surprise, they instead direct him to a different field.On Tamoanchan proper.Can you confirm that?he asks, and they do.Diego looks at me and shrugs.But we proceed to the airfield as indicated.What did we do this time?I ask.Only what we planned to, Diego says.This cant be about us.It should be comforting, but its not.If theyre not letting us go to the Orchard, then maybe something happened there.A feeling grips my stomach, like a slow poison is eating away at my insides.Lets get down quickly, I say.And find out whats going on.Diego brings us in for a landing, and the ground crew helps secure us.Im the first at the ladder.As I hit the ground, I realize somethings not right.There are too many people gathered to meet us.And one of them is Miranda.Despite the strangeness, the relief floods through me.I flash her a questioning look, but shes got a smile a meter wide on her face.Lewis is also there with Brana, a few of the boffins, and some stern faced Tamoanchan Keepers.To be honest, Im getting a little tired of peacekeepers.Dont think Im not appreciative of the welcome, I say.But this is a little much.Miranda pushes past the others and stands before me, smiling.We did it, Ben!she says.Did what?Our test.For the virus.We made it.You did?She nods, her smile still wide and infectious.She did it.You did it!I say.Goddamnit.I shake my head.Of course you did.I start trying to pull her to me, to hug her, but then realize I havent been through quarantine.Instead I squeeze my fists in a gesture of triumph.Miranda looks over to Diego, Rosie, and Maya.All of you get to be some of our first test subjects.So while we stand there (me trying to ignore the armed Keepers staring at me), Miranda takes samples of our blood.We dont have facilities yet, obviously, she says as my blood spills out into a tube.But well set them up at one or two of the fields to test anyone coming in.I look at the tube almost full with dark red blood.Are you going to have enough of those?I ask.She nods.We have a stockpile.Im sure Mayas supplies have more.But its going to be a struggle.We can reuse needles with proper sterilization.My eyes widen.Are you sure, Miranda?This is the Bug were talking about.And we can test for it, now.If a subject is positive, well destroy the syringe.But if not, we can make sure it can be used again.Same for the tubes, if necessary.Well have to continue looking for more, though.I know what shes thinking.That this is only the first step in the grand plan.That soon theyll have what they really wanta cureand all of the test tubes and syringes and equipment left in the world can be devoted to making that work until its not needed at all.I squeeze her hand.I take it I missed the celebration?I ask.Yes, sorry.Lewis wanted to make his announcement after we had confirmed the test with the Feral blood.Of course.He wanted to make his play as soon as possible.She nods.It seems to be working.The people here seem pleased with this latest development.I thought they might be.I flash a smile at Brana, wondering if that pissed off look is because Lewis scored a victory.With her its hard to tell.I hope theres some hooch left, I say.Miranda smiles back at me.I think we can dig some up.She grabs my arm.We couldnt have done it without you, Ben.Yes, you could, I say.But I make things harder so often that I suppose I was overdue for making something easier.If thats how it works, you have a lot owed to you.I can hope.They make us wait on the airfield, the Keepers never letting up with their intense stares.I have to admit that their presence is a good idea.Even if someone turns up clean, not infected, theres always the chance of conflict.Violence.And if the boffins are going to be here on the front line, they need protection.For a moment I consider the possibility of becoming a Keeper.I need something to do, and Ive mostly been good at protecting the boffins, but ...I cant really see myself in one of those brown and green uniforms.I cant see myself snapping to attention and following the orders of Lewis or Brana or any of the other members of the Council, like a good little soldier.I cant imagine me keeping the peace.Its not me.Well, Ben, you still need to find your place.Get to it.We wait about an hour or so to be cleared.Mirandas science station has been set up nearby on the main island now.One of the other ships brought in an electron microscopesomething Miranda says can see really, really small, like virus smalland together with some help from Lewis, they set it up on a vacant plot of land.They built a hasty structure around it for now, but thats where the blood samples will go, facilitated by runners and cyclists.I spend most of the time chatting with Diego, talking repairs on the Osprey, assessing the other ships on the field, while Rosie talks with Maya.The two of them seem to have really hit it off.They make a contrast, the two of themRosie, tall and athletic, hard and dark, and Maya, short and almost delicate, with golden skin.As I watch, Rosie smiles and, in a movement that seems uncharacteristic, reaches out and playfully pats Mayas arm.Oh, I think.I am such an idiot.Diego sees where Im looking and nods.Looks like Rosie found a friend.Yeah, I say.I cant believe I missed it.Im glad, he says.Its been ...I dont know how long.She doesnt open up to people much.I got that impression.Yeah, well, maybe this will soften her mood.To you.To everything.I hope so, I say.I like your sister.We worked well together at the helium plant.And it looks like were all going to be here for a while.You given much thought to what youre going to do?Long term?I feel like thats mostly what Ive been thinking about, I say.And I still dont have any answers.Well, if we get cleared for free passage, you can fly with us on the Osprey.We could always use another pair of hands, or another gun.Youre thinking of going back to foraging?He nods.That or running errands for the Council.He scratches his beard.Theres no chance of me making the Council.Not anymore.Im sorry.He shrugs.Its okay.Im learning to live with it.It could be worse.I could be dead.Thats one way to look at it.I can still be of use, he says.And you can still get back into the sky.What do you say?I nod.First to myself, then to him.I think that could work.Thanks.Do you think Rosie will be okay with it?He gestures over to where she and Maya are smiling and laughing.I think I can convince her.Anders comes back to us with our results instead of Miranda.After he clears us for entry (were all clean, as expected) he tells me that Miranda had to deal with something in the lab.I have a feeling that this is how things are going to be from now on.Shes got her people, her operation, and her goal is in sight.Not that I mind.Im happy to see her happy.In the meantime, I content myself with helping out where I can.I help Rosie and Diego and Maya unload the Osprey and move the equipment over to the new science station (which apparently still needs a namethe boffins have developed a very complex system, with charts and graphs, to determine one).I get a glimpse of the electron microscope, which is a massive and modern looking piece of tech.Theyve stabilized the ground its on with some metal sheeting and heavy stones to anchor it.Theres also a mess of wires and cables around it.It looks like its hooked up to solar cells and several generators.Leave it to the boffins to figure out how something like that can work.Crazy Osaka in particular is pretty good at that sort of thing.I spend a moment looking for Miranda or Sergei, but they dont seem to be around, so I go back to town.I notice as I do that there are a lot more vehicles on the footpaths that lead around the island.Bicycles, mostly, some with passenger compartments on their backs.I think they call them rickshaws.I find myself tempted to take one, then realize that I dont have anything to barter with.Makes me think, though.Barter can probably only work out here for so long.At what point do people start switching to something else?A money system like they had back in the Clean.The concept seems foreign to me, but I think its probably inevitable.Its not that barter isnt a great conceptof course it is.I can see what youre offering me and in return I offer you something tangible, or a service or whatever.But the difficulty comes in the negotiation.And if youre a carpenter and I dont need any carpentry work done, what then?How do you get what you need?The world is changing around you, Ben.Can you change with it?When I reach town, I head straight for Lewiss office.Im sure theres a bureaucracy here, a system that I should be going through, but weve done a lot for him, so I figure he owes me.He leans back in his chair and steeples his fingers together.Do you need something?I cross my arms.Not me, Miranda.He frowns.I believe I addressed She needs a place to sleep, I say.Not that box you have them all crammed into now.Shes the head of this operation.She needs to stay sharp.His face goes hard.Im the head of this operation.I cant stop myself from rolling my eyes.She does all the heavy lifting.He chews on that for a moment.Ive already authorized the construction of new housing for Mirandas people.I picked a suitable spot, I think, between the main sprawl of town and the science station.But thats going to take a while, I say.She needs something now.His expression turns thoughtful, and he nods to himself.She has earned it.I bet hes picturing the ceremony where he gives it to her.In front of lots and lots of people.Demonstrating his benevolence.Do you have something for her?He nods and taps his wooden desk.There are a few places we can use.His face clouds.Weve lost some people recently.Togs and Pepper, for example.I look at him blankly.They were an older couple, here with us almost from the beginning....They were good people.What happened to them?I ask.They died, he says, surprised.I figured that.How?It was an infection.Not the Bug, of course, but just some kind of pneumonia.I know its irrational, but I wonder about moving in to a place that had disease.There are other places, too, Lewis says, as if reading my mind.Bates, you know him?I shake my head.He moved in with his partner, Tyler.His house is open.He waves a hand in the air.There are others.Great.He stares at me.You know I dont have the people to help set it up, dont you?Were stretched thin as it is with everything going on.I nod.Ill see what I can do.His expression verges on incredulity, but he inclines his head in agreement.Then you can have Batess place.Ill have one of the Keepers show you.Thank you, I say.So the Keeper shows me the place, a small, wooden cabin with three rooms and a place to build a fire.Seems like it would be perfect for Miranda.Theres a simple bed frame here, some furniture that was left behind.But its dusty, and the air smells stale.Its going to need some work.Well, Ben, youve been looking for a purpose.I do what I can to sweep the house and dust it.The windows are simple hatches in the side, wood reinforced by metal, but I open these and try to get the air circulating.Ive only ever really cleaned the Cherubs gondola.This is something of a new experience.Eventually it starts looking, and smelling, better.I spend the rest of the day searching the markets of Tamoanchan.I have my cut from the run out to Maya and Hectors stash.Some of the items that Miranda didnt need.The blankets (which seem remarkably clean), I keep.But there are other itemssome metal, a few mirrors, and some spicesthat make great barter.I trade for some items to fix up the house, and I return to it and set them up.Blankets, pillows, some simple plates to eat off of.Jugs for water from the nearby well.Things like that.And some cooked chicken.Someone here brought some birds back from the mainland and started breeding them.It cost a bundle (most of my good spices), but its worth it.Then I send a messenger off to Miranda and build a fire so that the house is nice and warm.Then I sit back and wait.Shes been working really hard.She deserves something special.It occurs to me that this will be our first time alone togethertruly alonesince, well, since the Cherub blew up.Something about that scares me.I wait for a while.Then a while longer.Im starting to get worried when theres a knock on the door.I can tell Mirandas knocking pattern immediately.I open the door with a wide smile on my face.It fades when I see Miranda.Shes been looking tired lately, of course, what with all the work and the poor sleeping conditions, but right now she looks worseher face tight, her eyes red, as if shes been crying.Whats the matter?I ask.She meets my eyes, and I see the sadness and pain there.Sergeis sick, she says.EIGHTEEN They come for Sergei in the morning, with guns.Its a small islandword travels fastand this is the Sick.People are paranoid about disease.The Bug has taught us that.So they send four Keepers, each one carrying a rifle, to the house where Sergei is resting.They kick open the door, rifles out, and I freeze.One of the Keepers pushes me against the wall.Sergei is lying on the bed, Miranda is sitting next to him.Over him.I see the rage sparking behind her eyes.This man is sick!she says.Which is why we have to move him into quarantine, the head Keeper says, his voice muffled by the cloth wrapped around his mouth.Please move away from him.Miranda, Sergei says, his voice weak, Ill go.No, she says.No, you wont.I dont move, but thats only because theres a rifle pointed at my chest and I dont want to be splattered all over the wall.I can tell by the posture of the Keepers and the way theyre covered and protected that theyre not playing around.We have to take him in, the head Keeper repeats.And you have to move away from the body.This man needs treatment, not isolation.This man, per island laws, has to be put into quarantine, the head Keeper says, loudly and slowly.Youll have to shoot me, then, Miranda says.Miranda, I say.I wont let them take him.I examine the Keepers.Theyre all covered up, but I can see the tension in their posture.Theyre scared, tense.One of them could shoot Miranda.Lets just ...calm down, I say.No ones getting shot today.We can all agree that thats the last thing we want, right?The head Keeper looks at me.Why dont you send for Lewis?He can help straighten this out.The head Keeper continues to look at me.Its worth it if we can avoid bloodshed, right?The head Keeper turns to one of his men and tells him to go.The Keeper in front of me pushes his rifle barrel into my chest.Miranda turns back to Sergei, wiping his forehead with a handkerchief.I know shes just trying to comfort him, but its making me anxious.Shes wearing gloves, and shes been mostly using her scarf, but whatever Sergei has right now is a mystery.The thing is, I completely sympathize with these men.It doesnt matter if Sergei has the common cold, hes clearly sick and the cause, at least at this point, is unknown.Miranda tested him for the Bugwe know its not thatbut she cant tell what it is.Getting Sergei locked away is, frankly, the best way to deal with it.On the other hand, the Keepers are likely to throw him into a bare cell and leave him there to die.Mirandas the best person on the island to be with him, and he needs a bed, water to drink, care.I want to relax and wait for Lewis, but its hard with the rifle jammed into my sternum.And the head Keeper is looking at Miranda in a way thats making me uncomfortable.Move away from the body, he says.Hes not a body, Miranda says.His name is Sergei.The Keeper advances, his rifle up, pointed at Miranda.Move away now.The Keeper on me turns to look at their leader along with everyone else, and without thinking I swivel, quickly, slapping the barrel of the rifle away, slamming my head forward into his.Im already stepping forward toward the lead man and Miranda when three other rifles turn to bear on me.Everyone is yelling, but I cant make out the words.I want to reach for the revolver, but I force myself not to.I think, This is it.Im going to get shot here, a stain on the wall of the cabin I tried so hard to clean.Stand down!Everyone turns to see Lewis standing in the doorway, his eyes wide, his face rigid.Put your weapons down.Then, when no one immediately complies, Now!The Keepers lower their rifles.What the hell is going on?Lewis asks.She wont move away and let us take him, the lead Keeper says.He needs treatment, Miranda says.You have to let me treat him.Lewis crosses his arms.We have protocols about disease.You should understand that.Miranda keeps her voice low and even.Ive already tested him for Maenad.Hes clean.His symptoms are different.Do you know what he has, then?Lewis asks.Miranda is silent for a moment.No.Not yet.But I will.He needs to be in quarantine, Lewis says.And honestly, so do you.What?I ask.Whatever he has, youre probably exposed, Lewis says.You dont know that, Miranda says.We dont know what this is.Lewis shrugs.You wanted to treat him.To examine him.You can do that from quarantine.Ill need my equipment.My team.Uh uh.Lewis shakes his head.He points at Miranda.Just you.But We have to limit exposure.You examine him, you figure out whats going on.Just you.Miranda opens her mouth, about to speak, and then just exhales into a sigh.Okay.Just me.I wonder if she would have agreed if it had been anyone other than Sergei.I think about offering to go with them, but ...I dont.I look at Sergei, his skin gray and drawn, his face shining with perspiration, and I dont.I curse myself for it.But I keep my mouth shut.I tell myself that Id be useless with them, and its true, but I still curse myself.Miranda gets to her feet.Well need to carry him, she says.I can help rig us a stretcher.There should be some wood nearby, from the new constructions, Lewis says.He sends two of the Keepers to go get something.Miranda catches my eye.Looks like its my turn to take the crown.She smiles, though theres no mirth in it.The Quarantine Queen.It wont be for long, I say.Youll figure out whats wrong with him.And youll fix it.She nods, but it looks as if shes not completely sure.I need you to help keep an eye on the team.Okay, I say.I mean it, she says.They tend to get a little ...scattered when Im not around.I noticed.I nod.Done.And...she says, and I dont like the look on her face.It looks like shes about to dare me.And what?And I need you to talk to Clay.Oh, great.I need you to ask him what Sergeis been doing.If hes been working with anything different or new.If he exhibited any symptoms before he collapsed.I sigh.Okay.For you and for Sergei.And Ben.Try to be nice.Me?Im always nice.She gives me a look that says she knows better.Okay, I say.Ill be as nice as I can.Good.She smiles at me again.We both stand there for a moment.I want to go to her, hug her, tell her its going to be okay.But I cant.If I do, Im joining them in quarantine.Instead, I say, Youll fix this.I know you will.It sounds weak.She gives me a nod.Send me a message if you turn anything up.I will, I say.And then the Keepers escort me out.Before I see Clay, I stop off to see Rabbi Cohen.His synagogue is empty, but I find him straightening up.He smiles when he sees me.Ah, Ben, he says.Hes wearing a simple, knit cap today, sweater and pants both black.He comes forward to me, clasps my hands in his own.Then he must see something in my face because he says, Whats the matter?I came to ask you to pray for someone, I say.He frowns.Who?His name is Sergei.Hes one of the scientists I came here with.Hes sick.He places a comforting hand on my collar.I am very sorry to hear that.Are you two close?I shrug.I consider him a friend.But hes practically a father to Miranda.Ah, I see, he says.He gestures for me to sit on one of the wooden benches, and when I do he sinks down next to me.And you cant stand seeing her upset.I just ...shes been through a lot.And we just got a win with this detection test of hers and things are starting to settle down and then ...this.The rabbi is silent.He just stares at me.I like Sergei, I do.And of course I want to see him well.He chuckles.What?Youre human, he says.Youre unhappy because a friend of yours is sick.Youre also upset because someone you care for is upset.Yes, I say.I just ...I want him to be well.Who is taking care of him?Miranda.I see.Theyre in quarantine now.So thats why youve come to me.Im kinda running out of options, I say.Very well.He folds his hands in his lap.But let me ask you, why should I do the work for you?Why cant you pray yourself?I squirm a bit.Because it would be hypocritical.Because I dont believe.But because I do, that makes it okay?You do realize youre asking me to do something you claim not to believe in.Ill take whatever help I can get, I say.And if God is up there, listening, Im sure hes more likely to do you a favor than me.His face is skeptical.It makes perfect sense to me.Ben, you do realize that God isnt there for us to ask things of, right?I tried to explain that to you before.Look, Rabbi, like I said, Im willing to try anything at this point.Were so close, I say.So close to some kind of change.A good one.I can feel it.I just want us to get there.Is that optimism I hear?I guess.And I start wondering, When did I start believing Miranda?What convinced me that she might be right?Was it the test?Or was it when I realized I had feelings for her?Or is it just that Im sick of always being afraid.Cautious.Waiting for the sky to fall.The rabbi pats my leg.I will pray for your friend, Ben, he says.And I will pray for you and I will pray for Miranda.Not because you asked me to, mind you.But because I would have done so anyway, once I heard what was happening.Ill take it, I say.Thank you.I get up to go, and he shuffles off to continue his straightening up.You still havent shown up for services, he says as I turn away.Yeah.Ive been a little busy, Rabbi.Maybe when all of this is over?Im not asking you to pray.Or even to believe.Just come and sit.Listen to the words.Okay, I say.When all of this is over, Ill come.He smiles.Good.As I walk out, I realize that I actually mean it.Ill come back when Sergei is better and all this hubbub dies down, and Ill sit and listen to the rabbi sing the songs of my childhood.A part of me cant wait.The thing about the rabbi is that being with him, talking to him, ultimately calms me.Theres something in his demeanor, or something about him, that generates a sense of ease in me.A feeling that everything will be okay.He relaxes me.Clay is the exact opposite.I prepare myself as I walk to the lab, telling myself to be nice, that its for Miranda, that its for Sergei, and I think I have it down.I can be nice to him.I can ignore how I felt about him in the past.But then I see his smug face, the expression that flits over it as I walk in, and I just want to punch him.Mirandas not here, he says, his eyes back on whatever work hes doing.I know.Shes with Sergei.In quarantine.Oh, he says.He looks up.How is he?The same, I say.At least Miranda gets to stay with him.Lewis is going to give her some of her equipment.Good, he says.I dont suppose theyll let anyone else in?I shake my head.Only Miranda.Damn, he says.Miranda wanted me to ask if you noticed anything weird about him before he collapsed.Or if he had been working with anything new or different.He was working on the detection test, same as everyone else, he says.He wasnt even working with any blood at all.Just the reagents.Could one of those have caused this?No, he says.I cant imagine how.And weve all been working with them.Did you notice any symptoms?I ask.Clay sits back and crosses his arms across his chest.Nothing that couldnt also seem to be the results of overworking.He looked tired.A bit rundown.But most of us do.Weve been working practically nonstop for days.If I had noticed something, dont you think I would have said something?And to someone other than you?Look, I say.Im asking for Miranda.Im not trying to imply anything.Shes worried about Sergei.Clay stands up.Im worried about him, too, he says.Im the one whos been with him this whole time.While you and Miranda were off having adventures in the sky.Adventures?I say, feeling my face get hot.Fucking adventures?Which recent events would those be?Me losing my ship?Me getting shot?Diego getting tortured?My ship blowing up?Getting thrown in a cell multiple times?My voice is getting louder now.Dont forget that I helped get you that data from Gastown.Or that I helped free the boffins from that camp.Or that I fucking stopped raiders from dropping Ferals on your head.He moves forward.The team wouldnt have even needed rescuing if you hadnt run back at Apple Pi.Shut your fucking mouth.I move closer to him.You werent fucking there.And what about the rest?What about my friends who are still unaccounted for?Clay.And it was your presence on Gastown that gave away our location in the first place.Because Ben loses his ship and Miranda jumps to help him get it back.Its your fault you had to blow your fucking ship up.Mirandas too.Its all I can do not to tear into him.Theres something red and pulsing behind my eyes and my fists are clenched at my sides, wanting to be used.And Im supposed to be happy because, what, because Miranda decided to pretend to be a spy and got us some data from Gastown?Please.Wait, I say.Who are you mad at?Me or her?Both of you!She changed after you came along.She used to be focused on the work.On the science.Now she drops it all every time you get stuck in a ditch.And if you havent noticed, you fall into an awful lot of ditches.She leaves Sergei and me here alone, trapped here, to continue the work while she plays zep with you.Some of the heat inside of me starts to fade.Im starting to get it now.He is mad at Miranda.Probably a little because he has a thing for her, but mostly because Clay is a zealot.A science zealot.To him theres nothing higher.And Miranda has at least partially replaced it with caring about people.In Clays world, the science comes first.And thats one of the reasons I cant stand him and I much prefer Mirandas company.I force myself to take a deep breath.I unclench my hands.I hold them up placatingly.Its all I can do to keep them still.Im not here to fight, I say.You have issues with me and Miranda, fine.But this isnt about us.Its about Sergei.And he didnt leave you.Hes been here with you for the past few weeks.And he needs your help.Clay exhales loudly, and his shoulders drop from their bunched up position.Like I said, hes been rundown lately.He rubs his temples.I thought it was just exhaustion.He pauses.And age.Sergeis the oldest.I thought the years were just catching up to him.And now?Now I think its something else.He sighs.Ill get in touch with Miranda.Get her a message through quarantine.Ill see how I can help.He lowers his head back to his work.I guess thats it, then.I turn to go.Does it scare you?he asks, just as Im about to walk out.My first thought is hes asking me about the disease.The answer is yes, but Im not going to tell him that.What the fuck are you talking about?Your extinction.The world is moving on.I think you know jack shit about the world, seeing as youve been stuck here for weeks.Were building something here.Something new.There are no bones for you to pick here.I can think of a few that are begging to be broken.He nods.There it is.The threat of violence.Your first and last resort.Fuck you, Clay.You left out my profanity.He shakes his head.Dont get too comfortable in your new world just yet, I say.Youre not the first to think youve emerged from the Sick.Not the first to think youve evolved.Im all for civilization, but its not made of bricks, its made of paper.I like paper.So does fire.I hold his gaze.Remember what happened to Gastown.He looks away.Thats the problem with paper, I say.Someone can always black out everything you wrote.Then well keep writing, he says.I nod.Lets hope in the end that someone is around to read the book.Two more people get sick the next day.Then five more the day after.Lewis is losing his mind.Miranda has been telling him its not the Bugand it cant be, otherwise people would have Faded by now.Wed have Ferals on our hands.Instead, Sergei is just wasting away, and now others have joined him.Literally, too.They moved them out to Mirandas lab.The new one.They wanted to move them all to the Orchard, but Miranda needs access to her equipment.Everyone else has been ordered to stay in their homes and to limit contact with anyone else.The whole island is afraid.And as far as I can tell, Miranda has no idea whats happening.Which makes me afraid.Mirandas spent yearsdecadesworking on the Bug, but this is entirely new.I check on the rabbi to make sure that hes okay.He is, thankfully.But hes staying inside.Me, Im supposed to, but I cant.Big surprise.I have Mirandas house to hide in, but it feels alien and empty now.Im wandering the streets, ducking Keepers, when Clay finds me.Good, he says.Ive been looking for you.And thats when I really know that things are badbecause Clays glad to see me.Whats wrong?He ruffles his short, brown hair.Theres a lot more gray in it, it seems, than I remember.I found something on the electron microscope.What kind of something?He sighs.Miranda sent out a sample of Sergeis blood and asked me to run it through the machine.Just on the off chance it might tell us something.And?We hear some shouts, and both of us look around us.Can we get off the street?Clay asks.Okay.I nod.We can go to ...my house.I bring him back and let him in.He looks around quickly but doesnt say anything.He looks uncomfortable.I found something.I figured that.How much do you know about Maenad?I shrug.A little.What Mirandas told me.What I picked up from the rest of you.He looks at me, as if searching my face.The Maenad virus has a very specific structure.It has a shell around it, a protein shell.Thats part of what weve been able to assemble with our data and the new data Miranda stole.What does that have to do with this new disease?He shakes his head, already impatient with me.But he closes his eyes, inhales, and starts again.Whatever it is thats infected Sergei has the same protein shell.Its the Bug?No, he says, on the verge of exasperation again.Its not Maenad.Only the shell is the same.So, what, its some kind of mutation?I dont think so, Clay says.I grit my teeth.You know I dont know much about this, Clay.Plot me a course.A mutation of the Maenad virus would still resemble the virus.This is something completely different.From all the evidence, the disease seems to be autoimmune.Sergeis body is attacking itself.Thats not the way Maenad operates.The only reason I can see for the resemblance is that this new disease, this new virus, was engineered.Wait a second, I say.Something Miranda told me weeks ago comes flooding back into my brain.Miranda said that the Cabal was studying the Bug so that they could use it.She said it was possible that they could, I dont know, scrape out its guts and use it to carry something else.He looks at me, his face grim.A crude way to put it, but essentially, yes.I think thats what we have.I start pacing the room.So this isnt natural?I dont think so.Damn it!I feel something roiling in the pit of me.Something hot and angry.This was scary and bewildering when it was something unknown and natural, but now its a weapon.
