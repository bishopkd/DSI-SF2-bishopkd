Sounds great.Talk to you later, he said, hanging up.He walked back into the living room and Octavia was looking out the back door at Solstice lying under her favorite tree in the back yard.The driver sighed.He realized this girl was just trying to make her family happy, and she didnt seem pure evil like Shirley.Are you hungry?She turned around and nodded.Great, you ever had pork chops?She shook her head, and the driver sighed.I dont want to know what kind of fancy food you dine on, so, dont tell me, he said.She smirked and said, Its probably better you dont know.While he prepared lunch, they talked casually.She played the cello, had just finished a masters degree in business, and enjoyed playing volleyball.All in all, she seemed like a normal girl...except she was filthy rich.They ate, and the driver continued to learn more about her while telling her some about him.He told her about being an orphan and driving a cab through space for a living.He also told her the story of how he got Solstice.The more they talked, the more he realized that she wasnt all that unlikable.If he wasnt dating Karmen and Shirley wasnt involved, he might have even given this girl a chance.Shirley was right about one thing.She is very pretty, the driver said, noticing her long and silky hair.He didnt even want to think about how much care she put into washing it.As they finished their meal, she even did the dishes, and the driver realized she liked having money, but she could likely survive without it.Look, Octavia, sure, weve talked, shared a meal together, etc.You seem like a nice girl.I get that you dont want to disappoint your family, but I dont plan on marrying you.I love Karmen, and I can realistically say I will probably end up marrying her down the road.Theres nothing I can do to change your mind?No...but can I offer you a piece of advice?She raised an eyebrow and nodded.Put some distance between yourself and your family.Take a year off, hide if need be, and live in the real world.Get a job and work for yourself.When youve weaned yourself off of your familys money, I think youll see that you dont want to marry someone just because of your folks, he said.Octavia smiled, and said, I really do wish I could do just that.There are times I wonder what it would be like to be on my own.Then why not go and do it?She sighed and said, I dont love money like my family does, but I do like the benefits of having it.Before the driver could say anything more, the door opened and in walked Shirley.I trust youve become smitten with your new wife?The driver rolled his eyes and looked over at Octavia.Im only gonna say this once more, so, listen up.As far as Im concerned, my real family is Chris and Nancy Thompson who took me in as a teen and raised me right.Youre nothing to me, and after meeting you today, I wish to never cross paths with you again.Youre insufferable.No, Im not smitten with Octavia.No, were not getting married.Yes, you can leave now and never come back, the driver said.His mother scowled and clenched her right hand into a fist.I dont know how you turned out to be so much like your grandfather, but he was that way...a poor pathetic sad sack who deemed your father and I to be unfit parents and took you away from us.He didnt want anything to do with our money or success and died penniless, the old fool.Sounds like a man I could be proud of, the driver said.And you share his blind and foolish ways of thinking.I believe the word youre looking for is stubborn, the driver said, smirking.Lets go, Octavia.Were leaving this dump, Shirley said.She looked at the driver and then said, Thats quite alright, Ms.Shirley.I know my way home.Shirley shrugged and looked once more toward her son.Dont take my leaving today as a sign of victory.You will come around to my offer.I was hoping we could do it the easy way, but youve shown that just isnt going to be possible.Because of that, Im going to take everything you love from you until youre so miserable you come crawling back to me for the chance to have some resemblance of a normal life.He lit his last cigarette and grinned from ear to ear.Goodbye, Ms.Rider.Do take care, and dont let my door hit you in the ass on the way out.Id hate to damage such a fine door, he said.She scoffed and left.Octavia turned to him and simply said, I kind of wish I really could have a shot with you...and not just because of my parents demands.You seem like a nice guy.Karmen would likely tell you otherwise.I have a nasty temper and stubborn streak, the driver said.She smiled and excused herself, leaving not too long after Shirley.The driver let Solstice back in and put away the dishes.She growled when she saw the cigarette in his mouth, and he put it out immediately.Sorry...trust me when I say I needed it though.Oddly enough, the dog didnt look as though she bought his logic.Oh youre a husky.What do you know?She barked, and for a moment, the driver wondered if, by chance, she was more intelligent than she let on.Eventually, he let it go and fell asleep on the couch.She jumped up and laid down on his legs, going to sleep herself.He began to have a strange dream about both Karmen and Octavia being in a band together.They traveled the world and became famous before having a falling out and breaking apart.A knock at the door brought the driver back to reality.He yawned and went to answer it, praying it wasnt his mother.Dominick, if youre hearing this prayer, please keep my mother...far far away, he muttered.He opened the door and saw Karmen.Her hair was pink, and she was still wearing a heavy amount of eye shadow from her shift at the bar.The fake tattoo above her eyebrow was still on, and the driver smirked remembering she dressed a certain way to keep the drillers of Europa uninterested in her.Welcome back, he said, motioning for her to come in.Actually, can we talk out here?He shrugged and closed the door behind him, leaning on it once it was latched.Whats up?She sighed and looked down.When she looked up, she said, Listen...I dont have any easy way of putting this...so I just have to say it.I think that...I need to end this relationship.The driver frowned and asked, What are you talking about?Im breaking up with you, she said, shifting her weight from one leg to another.Feeling like a sack of bricks had just nailed him in the stomach, he was unable to form words.He thought, Shes breaking up with me?The driver was not an overly emotional guy, but a single tear still formed in his right eye as he thought about what he was hearing.Wh why?She sighed again, but she didnt break eye contact with him.She was soft but direct, not beating around the bush with her words.I think we want different things.I think youre getting a little too serious, and Im just not in a place where I want to settle down with someone right now, she said.Who said anything about settling down?You just told me a few hours ago you had a hard time going a week without seeing me.Meanwhile, Im fine going a week or two without seeing you.Its not that I dont care about you...its just...I think you care more about me, she said.Cant we just slow things down?Do you honestly think youre capable of doing that?Because if you are, then we can keep dating, but Im getting ready to take a vacation with some friends, and you wont see me for a few weeks, she said.The driver looked down, knowing he wouldnt be okay with that.Youre not capable of slowing it down, are you?I guess not.Had you thought about...our future?He nodded slowly, and she said, You see?I hadnt really at all.We had lots of fun, and youre a very sweet guy, but  You dont need to say any more.I get it, the driver said, straightening up and cutting her off.She smiled weakly and said, I guess this is it then.Yeah....If youre ever around Europa, you can feel free to stop by.Im not going to avoid you.I cant promise the same, he said, walking inside and closing the door.As she left, he slid down to the floor and quietly sobbed.Solstice came over and tried to lick his face, but it was buried in his knees.Sensing the depth of her friends grief, she simply curled up next to him and lay down.I didnt want much, Solstice...just you and her.Thats all I ever wanted, he said as tears continued to fall.He sniffed and continued to sit there, thinking about the miserable day hed had.10: Stubborn  The driver sat in his bed with his earpiece on, talking to Chris.Hey man, Im gonna need to take a sick day today, he said.You already used your sick days when you were in the hospital, Chris said.Well...then let me use a vacation day please.I still have a couple of those left, dont I?You should have a couple left, yeah.Whats wrong?Are you really sick, or are you just trying to escape Monday?The driver looked down at Solstice and sighed.He muttered, I just need a day, okay?Im not fit to be driving my cab right now.Silence filled the digital conversation for a moment until Chris said, Okay.Ill see you tomorrow then.Get better soon.Thanks.The driver ended the conversation and then tossed his earpiece onto the nightstand, rolling over in bed.He felt pathetic, but it seemed that the events of the previous day involving his mothers sudden appearance and Karmens exit from his life had taken more of a toll on him than he thought possible.The drivers evening was filled with a sleepless night and a little bit of alcohol.After three unsuccessful hours of trying to find sleep, he went into the living room and plopped down on the couch, turning on the television and watching whatever garbage happened to be on at 3 a. m.  He kept watching and waiting for his eyelids to close, but they never did.Words from his mother and Karmen kept bouncing around his thoughts.What did Shirley mean by shed take away everything he loved?Was she capable of drastic things like murder?Kidnapping?When his alarm went off to get ready for work, he tried to move, but his body was too tired.Getting absolutely no sleep, the driver felt and looked like trash.It took everything he had just to reach over on the nightstand for his earpiece to call in sick to Chris.After thoughts of his mother left his head, hed start thinking about Karmen again.I was moving too fast?How is that even possible.It wasnt like I was planning on marrying her at the end of the week, the driver thought.When thoughts of Karmen finally exited his mind, hed be back at Shirley again, and the vicious cycle did not end.He stayed in bed most of the day, getting up to take a piss now and again.He was too lazy to go into the kitchen, so, he drank out of the sink in his bathroom, and once he got up to let Solstice out.Getting delirious and desperate for sleep around 2 p. m. , he walked into the bathroom and found some of his old emergency sleeping pills.Once in a while the driver would suffer bouts of insomnia, and a doctor had given him what he liked to call just in case pills.Reading the label out loud, he said, Take one with food for relief from mild insomnia.Opening the small white bottle, he reached in and grabbed two pills with his index finger.Throwing them into his mouth, he poured himself a glass of water from the bathroom sink and swallowed the pills.Within 15 minutes he could feel them working.Oh sweet relief, he muttered.His eyes closed, and they did not open until a loud knock at his door jolted him awake.Looking over at his bedside clock and saw it was 9 p. m.  He felt a little better than he did earlier as he got up and stretched.His knees popped loudly, and the driver groaned.Popping his back, he yawned.I love those things, the driver said, sighing in relief.Opening his bedroom door, his feet met the wooden floor of his hallway, and the drivers toes immediately felt its cold surface.Did I take my socks off in my sleep?Shaking his head, he went to the front door.Im going to go out on a limb and guess Karmen hasnt swung by to make up, the driver thought to himself.Opening the door, he saw he was right.It wasnt Karmen.Hey boss, the driver muttered, seeing Chris standing before him in a red shirt and jeans.The red shirt had a pirate on it.Wow, thats not work attire, the driver said.I had to go home to grab something, and I figured Id change clothes before coming over, he said, walking past the driver into his house.Solstice came over, and Chris kneeled down to pet her.Hey girl.You taking care of my boy for me?She barked in response.Standing up, Chris revealed a brown paper bag in his right hand.You look like Hell, Chris said.The driver looked down at his wrinkled clothes from the day before.He had on a simple blue long sleeve shirt and jeans.Running his hand over his chin, he realized he had a nice five oclock shadow forming.Itd also been about 36 hours since hed showered.Sorry.I wasnt expecting company, the driver said.I knew you werent doing well, so, I decided to come see how you were.Did I sound that rough on the phone?You called Starla your taxi, Chris said.Oh.Yeah, Chris said, walking into the kitchen and fishing around for two glasses.When he found them, he walked back into the living room and sat on one end of the couch, pulling out a bottle of Highland Park 18 year old Scotch whisky.Walking over behind Chris, the driver asked, Whats the occasion?Opening the bottle, Chris said, You tell me.He poured himself a glass and then one for the driver.I think yours has more in it, the driver muttered.The game works like this.You tell me whats eating you alive, and you get more alcohol, Chris said, taking a sip of his glass.And what do you do in this game?I listen to you whine, and I get more alcohol, Chris said.The driver didnt object, taking his glass and sitting down on the other side of the couch.There was one cushion between the two men.Both were leaned back with their feet on the coffee table in front of the couch.Not knowing where to start, the driver said nothing.Karmen?Nodding, the driver sighed.Thats really only part of it.The real meat of the sandwich comes from yesterdays events involving my family, the driver said, taking a sip of his drink.Family?My mother, apparently, the driver said.Chris choked for a moment when he heard the word mother.Coughing and trying to get air back into his lungs, Chris asked, Your mother?Yes, my mother.She stopped by yesterday, the driver said, finishing his drink.Chris sat up and poured him another drink.Go on, he said.The driver explained that his mother was loaded with money and wanted him to give up his current life.In exchange, shed groom him into the new president of Rider Corp., the largest electron transportation company in existence.He told Chris about apparently being kidnapped by his grandfather and how he was dropped off at an orphanage so hed have a shot at a life that wasnt spent obsessing over money.He concluded with the news that his mother was trying to force him into a marriage that would ultimately lead to his familys company merging with their number two competitor.It took about 90 minutes and four drinks for the driver to get through his tale.When hed finished, Chris whistled.Your mother sounds like a real bitch, he said.I couldnt agree more.Oh, and Karmen broke up with me after all that.I spent hours sticking up for her to Shirley and Octavia, and then she dumps me.The irony, right?The two finished their drinks at the same time, and Chris poured the driver another glass.You know, you could have gotten some ice from the freezer for these, the driver muttered, thoroughly feeling the effects of the alcohol on his system.You know, you could have pulled your testicles out of the closet and put them on to drink these, Chris said.Shut up, old man.At least I still have my balls.I doubt you ever got yours back from Nancy, the driver said, chuckling.I suppose youre right there.When you get married, they dont exactly stay in your sock drawer.They go into the wifes underwear drawer, and you never get them back.Marriage huh...that must be...something, the driver said, looking over at Solstice sleeping in her doggie bed.Listen, youll find someone else.You dated Karmen for half a year.She didnt want any more, and thats her loss.At least she told you straight up and didnt run off with some other man, Chris said.Well, I do have that going for me.My former girlfriend is honest.Thats...wow...that makes everything better, the driver muttered.Chris scowled and then punched him in the nose, causing him to fall sideways off the couch.Ow!What the Hell, old man!Getting back up, the driver rubbed his now red nose.Get over yourself.
