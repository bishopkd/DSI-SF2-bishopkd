She rose slowly, making her way toward the door.Her day mare lingered, calling her, trying to drag her back.The fact she could feel that way scared her even more than anything Philman could have done to her in that moment.FURIOUS KNOWLEDGE There was a wild and steep feeling accompanying her as they made their way out into the biosphere.Her confidence grew as they ran, it was exhilarating, and she did not want to squander the feeling.The human hold on her was unraveling as they ran toward their freedom.Her question in the moment seemed natural enough.Where are we going?Alec was just a few steps ahead of her as they made their way through a section lined with the doors to living quarters.To the flight terminal.Are you flipping crazy?Well be caught for sure!Theyre expecting that!Alec ignored her concerns.They wound their way through the multiple bulkheads of this tier until they were in what seemed to be the confluence of this structure.It was funny how she had never noticed this nuance in design before, but now in her escape it made sense.There was something else I Glo was picking up on, the unusual energy within the place.When they passed people, they were in a hurry.No one in particular really looked at them or even tried to make eye contact, but for whatever the reason, I Glo felt as if they both were prominently standing out.They were fast approaching the departure area of the terminal.If Alec were seriously considering this option she hoped he realized the rockets were located at a site beyond the outer rings.There was nothing in the way of a vehicle even close to these doors that would have them flying off this rock.She was cringing with their arrival.Alec didnt deviate from his course, heading straight for their automated security complex.Systems like these never went to sleep, not with their monstrous eye in the sky; they were all seeing and all knowing.She hated places like this and wondered just how free one really was allowed to be beyond those turnstiles.The narrow passages were made of sections of grated alloys, lined with detectors and scanners, and designed to sniff out those of a suspicious nature.The devices were meant to be discriminating, and had no problem scrutinizing between Dextoid and human beings.This place had an intimidating feel, of automation mixed with force.It was obvious they were focused on finding those who were doing wrong.Still they seemed to radiate a hate for any type of Dextoid aesthetic.I Glo had it in the back of her mind to avoid stations just like this.Approaching she noticed right away the two entry points into the terminal, one for Dextoids and the other reserved for human use.It was always a little menacing for any Dextoid to see the warnings so pronounced and spelled out.I Glo knew those warnings were purposely put there to make them feel like second class citizens.Her work at La Compagnie dEtoile let her in on that dirty little secret.She still couldnt get her head around the fact people needed to continually put down their creations to feel good about themselves.Alec walked right up and entered through the human portal.When I Glo saw this she held her breath.The audacity of such a move scared her.She waited for the alarms and sirens to unleash their displeasure, for automated voices to bark out their harsh commands, but instead his action was greeted by nothing.I Glo was shocked as Alec now stood comfortably on the other side of the portal.He motioned her to pass through the Dextoid half of the entryway, but she wasnt having anything to do with it.He was becoming agitated with her stubborn behavior and finally barked out an ultimatum.I need you to go through those scanners, immediately!His dictum dripped with the frustration he was feeling for her situation.How could he be so unsympathetic to her needs?It was beyond her capacity to understand his insensitive nature in this moment.Of course she had a tentative feeling about crossing this threshold, especially after seeing what Alec had just done.It was as if she had witnessed some sort of black magic.The scale and scope of what he just pulled off was difficult to believe, he had crossed through the human portal.She obviously had questions on how this trick was done.After witnessing a performance like that everything seemed to be stacked against her, especially since she knew she was of Dextoid stock.She couldnt do what he had just done, there was no possible way, and yet she had just witnessed Alec complete the feat.It made her feel trapped inside her skin.It was obvious his agenda was not based on her fears.He seemed so determined to get beyond this place, probably because it held the wealth of craft they could commandeer and fly away in.It was a bold move, but bold moves seemed to be the pattern Alec liked to follow.She could only hope his bold moves would pan out better than how their initial meeting had ended.With that thought there was little else she could do, so she let herself go, making her way through the Dextoid detection device.She was acutely aware of how intently Alec was watching the monitors as she passed through the checkpoint.For some reason it put even more pressure on her to get through this section.In a blink of an eye she was on the other side.Her passing had not triggered any alarms.Alec smiled at her and then reared back and crushed the clear barrier between them.The amount of energy required to do that was tremendous, but it didnt seem to be a problem for Alec.He was calling for her to come over to his side.Alarms squelched out before the shards had come to rest.A computerized voice commanded them to stay put, but I Glo could see Alec had no intention of listening to their commands.Doors were closing, sealing off sections for leaving the biosphere and any chance for escape.This was madness!There was no way they were going to make it out of here now.This entire episode made absolutely no sense to her at all.The insanity for what was happening seemed to rain down with those crystalized shards.She became very angry with the thought Alec would go out of his way to draw this kind of attention to them.We have very little time.I need you to come over to my side now!It was all so confusing, but she was left with very few choices.She made her way through the opening and over to where Alec stood.Good, now I need you to return back through the human check point.She was beside herself, by doing this they would be right back at the entrance to the terminal, they were going nowhere!Alec was determined and her hesitation had him barking at her again.You need to do this, do it now!I Glo felt stupid but she went through the portal anyway.Maybe there was something he was trying to show her, but nothing in the immediate made sense.She hadnt even gotten half way through the security device before more alarms started sounding off.After she had gotten through to the other side, she looked back to see Alec studying the monitors very intently.After a few moments he made his way over to where she was and joined her.They found themselves both standing out in front of the terminal again, almost exactly where they had started.They had accomplished nothing but to show everyone in the biosphere where they were!She was furious.What in the hell are you trying to prove?Alec did not respond but instead reached out and grabbed her by the hand.They began quickly making their way back toward the center of the biosphere.People were rushing about in reaction to the alarms.She knew it was only a matter of time before every person in there would recognize them as the reason this biosphere was going on full alert.I Glo wanted to run away from them all, and in that moment, if given the chance, she would have even left Alec.THOSE CLOISTERED PLACES Before long she found they were in the middle of the main market place.Busy graphic storefronts greeted her everywhere she looked, they coxed her to come into the shops with the promise of goods and excellent service.There was something about this type of pitch she found alluring, the only reason she didn't pursue it was that Alec was there to keep her in check.Once she realized she wasnt going to be allowed to respond to these advertisements, she wanted nothing more than to leave, but even those hopes were dashed when Alec turned and lead her straight into an electronics shop.For all the urgency happening outside the doors of this establishment, a quiet calm still permeated within this shop, it were as if they stepped back in time to a more peaceful state.The music being pumped into the place was just low enough in volume that a customer wanting to know what song was coming over the speakers would have to stop and concentrate on it to actually hear what they were playing.The shop was moderate in size, but had isles filled with bins of parts, tools, and electronic supplies for the needs of every repair a colonist might have.As they were taking this all in, a smiling Service Dextoid came out from one of the isles to greet them.How can I help you today?Alec retorted immediately.I need a laser soldering gun.Ah, doing a little circuitry repair today?You could say that, but before I commit to such a purchase, I would like to see the different models you carry.I can assure you sir, we have the best laser soldering guns available on the market.You will find none better.The Service Dextoid was shouting this behind him the whole time he raced to the back of the store.He was speaking a little louder so I Glo and Alec could still hear him up in the front area.I have the exact same model we sell here back in my domicile.The Service Dextoid found the gun lying on his workbench and grabbed it.He shouted his next questions as loud as he could.How long have you been stationed here, is this your first gun?The Service Dextoid turned and was a little shocked to find Alec standing in the back room with him.I never said it was my first gun.Alec reached out and took the soldering gun from him.Do you mind?The Dextoid had been very cooperative to this point, and Alec wanted to make sure he stayed that way.The Service Dextoid was caught a little off guard by Alec being in the back room, but did not let it hinder his attentive nature.No, please take a look at the product for yourself.I Glo felt very uncomfortable standing up front all alone, so she eventually followed Alec to the back area.As Alec examined the soldering gun, he politely asked the Service Dextoid for his name.Gilford sir, at your service.Can you lock the store down please, Gilford?But sir, our hours of operation extend until eight this evening.Not today Gilford; today will be different.We both need your assistance in this matterit is of extreme importance.There are two fugitives loose within this biosphere and because of that we need you to lockdown and secure this site.Can you do that for us?Sir, are you asking me, or telling me?Gilford, I am telling you to lock this site down immediately.Gilford hurried out of the room.I Glo looked at Alec.How can you be sure he wont leave, or go out to notify the authorities of where we are?Could you have told him to lock the store down?I Glo thought about it, and the more she thought about it the more she realized she could not.She could not tell another Dextoid what to do.It was a revelation she wasnt prepared for.Had he not pointed it out she would have never considered the question.There are no certainties for what we are trying to accomplish, but then again we dont have the luxury or time to be certain.Alec paused just long enough before he made his second request.I need you to remove all of your clothes.I Glo was taken aback by this request.Are you asking me, or telling me?Im asking you.His look couldnt have been anymore serious; still it was hard for her to understand why Alec would be asking this of her.A feeling of embarrassment was now accompanying her thoughts, and she would probably feel even more so if Gilford returned to find her stripped of her clothing.Look, the only way you are going to be totally free of them is if I have a chance at removing the restrictive sensors installed in your body.I saw their locations on the scanners back at the departure terminal.I committed those locations to memory, it shouldnt take long to remove them, but if we are going to do this, we should start the process now.Gilford returned to the room to find I Glo laying face down naked on his workbench.Alec stood over her with the laser soldering gun burning small holes into her back.Gilford thought it strange to see one Dextoid working on another in this fashion.They did not react to his return and they didnt appear immediately concerned about whether or not he had actually locked the store down.Alec continued to focus on the task at hand.I Glo looked to be uncomfortable as she lay there clutching the corners of the table.Any time Alec nullified one of those sensors, I Glo seemed to spasm with terrible pain.His work was accompanied by a small popping sound each time a restrictive sensor expired, leaving an unpleasant smelling haze in the air and confirming for Gilford things were indeed burning.He could no longer contain his curiosity in the matter.Does it hurt?Before I Glo could muster a response, Alec answered for her.Of course it does, that is the way they have designed us, to feel pain when things which are meant to enslave us are being tampered or removed.Alec stopped what he was doing and looked up at Gilford, the intensity on his face reflected the total concentration he had for the operation.He held the gun at its side so Gilford could see the length of the tool as he slightly shook it at him.This is the price of freedom, eh?Gilford nodded silently.Everything within him said he should be rushing out the door to emphatically report what was happening within his shop, but there was something deeper inside his being prohibiting him from doing that.It was cultivating his curiosity, tilling the grounds in search of a deeper meaning.Do you have a precision cutting laser?The question snapped Gilford out of his thoughts.Why yes sir, we have several band widths to choose from.I will take the most precise one you carry, and some tweezers and elastic bands.Gilford began searching through his tool area.He could not help but notice how hard I Glo was gripping the table.Her hands were causing the slab to slightly shake under the strain.It was disturbing to see a Dextoid under so much stress; he had to keep reminding himself that she was doing this willingly.The scene was captivating and he did not want to look away.He suddenly saw the laser he was looking for at the bottom of the drawer and grabbed it.Here you are sir.Alec never looked up, continuing to work on her back.One moment, I need to finish what I am doing.Please set it down and find some tweezers.He directed his next comments to I Glo, and on that breath Gilford could sense the passion he had for her.It made the situation he was witnessing all the more powerful.I need to do one more thing...I Glo interrupted him.She strained a bit as she spoke.I think its a little over the top to try and clean things up, I can live with the scar tissue.Youre going to have too.Alec spoke as calmly as he could, but he couldnt hide his intensity.We dont have long, even now the nanotechnology in your body is at work trying to repair these sensors.I cant stop them from doing that, but I can do one more thing that will make the repairs they perform irrelevant.I need to go in and remove the actual device.There was a small pause as I Glo realized what Alec was trying to convey to her.I take it there is little you can do for me to ease the pain in doing that?The ugly truth is there is very little I can do to anesthetize the area.I cannot let you shut down because I may not be able to bring you out of it once I am finished.So I am going to ask you to try hard and remain conscious.Its the only way I can do this and know for sure I havent botched things up.She already looked to be in more pain than she cared to admit.She closed her eyes as tightly as she couldwishing she were somewhere else.I understand, lets get it over with.Alec knelt down beside her, so they were now eye to eye.He put his hand softly on her shoulder, and she responded to his touch.If it means anything to you, I came back for you, specifically for you I Glo.She smiled ever so slightly and whispered to him as she put her face back down onto the table.Of course it does Alec.Gilford chimed in.Is there anything I can do sir?To assist?Alec stood back up.You can hold her hand.Gilford looked a little perplexed by his response.He wasnt sure how the act would help Alec or I Glo for that matter.He was thinking more along the lines of a smock, a pair of gloves, towels, or maybe even a magnifier, but the request he made of him was strange.If he was holding her hand he couldnt respond to any request Alec might make if he changed his mind and needed something.His hands contained no healing powers, perhaps Alec asked this of him because he had been misinformed about Gilfords abilities and was depending on them.Gilford, I need you to do this for me now!Gilford reached out and held her hand.It was warm, very warm, warmer than expected.There was also an unexpected clamminess to them, telling him she was under a severe amount of duress.With the contact he could feel how violently she was trembling, and he knew Alec hadnt even started cutting at the guts of this thing.The feeling of holding her hand was amazing and powerful.Somehow he could transfer his caring for this situation just by touching her.Instinctively he reached out with his other hand to cover the one he was holding, he knew this would convey an additional support.This whole situation was screaming out for support, and he was able to do this by simply holding her hand.Alec was busy making quick, rapid, little incisions.Clear fluid began to pool in the middle of her back and run down the sides of her body.There was a lot more fluid than anyone was ready for.Even Alec felt a slight ping for the extreme fight he was immersed in.Please hurry Alec, this doesnt feel right at all.Panic was registering in I Glo's voice.Alec knew they were in serious trouble if he was starting to hear the panic he was feeling echo in others.He doubled his efforts to diligently solve the problem.Opening the composite box contained within the small of her back, he found the restrictor unit.Without hesitation he went to work on trying to remove it.He utilized several of the tweezers, tying them off with elastic bands to hold things in place.Working in this pool of clear fluid made things extremely difficult during this part of the operation.Several minutes had past and Alec had worked as quickly as he could before he paused.I am at a point where I can remove the unit, let me know if you detect anything that doesnt feel, well, natural.Are you kidding me, this whole procedure feels unnatural!For some strange reason Alec wanted to laugh, there was a dark humor laced within her retort, but every second he stood over her was another wasted.Looking at the object, it was small and slippery, and if he dropped it inside her they would have very real problems.He didnt want his thoughts drifting off in that direction, but knew he had to consider all possibilities.He reached in and began popping the unit away from the housing when I Glo shouted out frantically.It doesnt feel right!Alec!Stop!It was too late, the device shot right out of the housing and into the air.For a brief moment he watched as it hung there suspended in time, until he reached out and allowed it to rest in the palm of his hand.The unit was much more slippery then he imagined, and was about the size of a large kidney bean.I Glo shut down as soon as it was ejected.Gilford looked up at Alec.He was still clutching her hand, but feeling as if he had somehow failed in his effort to help him.He wanted Alec to know it wasnt his fault, but he really didnt know how to say it.He blurted out the obvious.Sir!She has stopped moving!Alec looked over in the area where Gilford had been retrieving his tools.On one of the workbenches he saw a compact flashlight.He went over and grabbed it, returning as quickly as possible to look into the restrictor unit.The beam of light traveled through the clear fluid, showing the compartment to be empty, and much to his disappointment there were no identifying features within the casing.The unit was shaped like a kidney bean and he was hoping to find an attachment point, some type of hilum, anything that would give him an in or a clue as to how this particular device worked.There was something uncomfortably real about this thing as he held it in his hand, as if its slipperiness was a designated part of its design.Alec didnt like the feel of it whatsoever.The smooth surface was pliable to his touch, having a little give to it.He looked at Gilford.Do you have a syringe?Gilford acknowledged him and disappeared from the room once again.He came back moments later with one and tried to hand it to Alec, but he wouldnt take it.Is it sterile?It is brand new sir.Pierce the skin of this restrictor unit with the needle.Sir my protocol clearly states, I cannot augment or repair any device that is or will be in direct contact with a Dextoid.I understand.Alec looked slightly flustered by his response.He reached out with one hand and took the syringe from him.He lined it up so he could push the needle in from the top of the kidney bean structure.With a little effort he punctured the skin of the thing and began to withdraw the fluid with the plunger.It looked to be thick, green, and aqueous as it filled the barrel.He looked back up at Gilford.I need a small clean glass.Gilford disappeared, returning moments later with one as per his request.Please fill the glass with some of the fluid from her back.He pulled the needle out and pointed it away from them, shooting the contents out onto an empty space on the floor.He placed the bevel of the needle back into the hole, inserting it again to withdraw more of the fluid from the restrictor unit.He did this until he felt he had emptied its contents.He then flushed the unit with the fluid from out of the glass, using a new needle of course.Once complete, he submerged the unit in the glass and filled it up the best he could.He looked it over one last time and then placed it back into the compartment.The container in her lower back almost grabbed the unit as it got close, snapping it into place.He looked over at Gilford who stared unblinking into the clear pooled cavity of I Glos back.They both stood there waiting, but nothing happened, I Glo lay there motionless.Alec was getting an uneasy feeling about what he had just done to her.How could he have been so stupid?Didnt he hear her cry out?In that one fleeting moment, when the nub of that thing popped out of the compartment, he had killed everything she was.His hands were covered in the clear fluid that was her blood.The chard pockmarks were still smoldering on her back.He looked down in disgust at the green fluid he had shot out onto the floor.He was really hoping he didnt need that slime to bring her back.What he knew about restrictor units and Dextoids told him they could function fine without them.He knew he didnt have one.He felt himself falling, not physically, but deep onto himself, as if a pillar of strength were suddenly shown the unstable foundation of doubt it had been built upon.He scrambled to find the kernel within him that forbid such a panicked emotion.It was then that I Glo began to slowly stir.Gilford reached out immediately and grabbed her hand, he could feel it slightly spasm, and reacted to this by shaking her hand excitedly and announcing to Alec she was indeed coming around.She lifted her head slightly and opened her eyes.Not wide at first, but just enough so she could see.She began looking around the room as if she were trying to find something to focus on.Alec quickly moved to one side of the table and knelt down so she could see him.How long, was I out?Not long at all.Do not move!I need to seal the wound.Do you feel all right?Complete?After this I dont know if Ill ever really say I feel complete.She gave a parched swallow.Did you remove it?Is it gone?Yes, its gone.Alec had genuine concerns about the nanotechnology repairing the device.It would all depend on how far her system would take things.He was holding out hope it would only repair the hole delivered by the bevel of that needle, and then leave well enough alone.There was no other way to answer her question because he had never seen a restrictor unit like hers before.He went to work on sealing her up.Gilford, do you have any fluid on hand that would allow us to replenish her system?I could look sir, but off the top of my head I would have to say no.There is a liter back at my place.Gilford responded but did not move, still holding onto I Glos hand.He finally looked up at Alec, slightly troubled.Is it alright, I mean to leave her?Yes Gilford, you have done a fine job, you can leave her now.Gilford went about scouring the place searching for containers of fluid.Alec really didnt hold out hope, he knew Gilford had a handle on this shop, if it were here he would have remembered.Alec did the best to cauterize the wound.There was little doubt in his mind she would be permanently scared from this, but at the same time he hoped she would find comfort in what the wound symbolized for her.You arent going to harm him, are you?I Glo whispered it, almost as if the thought suddenly had come to her.Alec was caught a little off guard by the question.Do you mean Gilford?No, the thought never even crossed my mind.I dont think I could stand to see that.Her whisper had a compassion Alec was unfamiliar with, but was willing to explore with her at a later date.Gilford came back to find I Glo standing up.She looked a little wobbly, but was on her own two feet.Gilford broke the news of not having any replacement fluid.Alec seemed to take the news in stride.Not to worry.I suspected as much.Is there a back door to this place?Yes, right through there.Gilford pointed to some curtains hanging in an entryway.We really wish to find the freight depot complex.Once you get out into the hall, continue down to the next level, you will see a series of painted lines on the floor, following any one of them will lead you to the main receiving dock.Once down there, if you wish to return, all routes out of the area will lead you back into the biosphere.I Glo extended her hand to Gilford.He made his way over to hold onto it.Thank you Gilford, for being there for me.It was my pleasure, but, I feel I have done nothing, Alec was the one...I Glo cut him off.Was the one who trusted you to do the right thing, which you did Gilford.I appreciate you being there for me.Gilford found himself touching an inner peace he hadnt known for quite sometime.It was amazing to him how the simple act of touching hands could stir something so vibrant inside him.The contact sent him out into a field of peaceful tranquility.Even as Alec and I Glo left the shop, he somehow still felt a connection to her, it was somewhat puzzling to him that it were even possible to feel this way, but it started him on a path to thinking about the other connections he was completely unaware of.Alec stopped just short of exiting the room.He looked back at Gilford one last time.Do everything you can to get clear of this place.I dont just mean the store either, but this entire biosphere.Make your way to any one of these escape shuttles and get the hell out of here before its too late.Thats an order.Before Gilford could retort, Alec was gone.Walking through those connecting halls, both Alec and I Glo found the combination of those pathways to be just short of a labyrinth.They walked for as long as they could until Alec sensed I Glo needed to take a break.He stopped so she could prop herself up inside a small nook in one of the walls.You wont be able to exert yourself as hard as you normally would because of the fluid loss.Her weakness was reflected in her response.I dont want to slow you down.You wont.I just need you to be honest with me about how hard you can push yourself.Maybe you should leave me, go on without me.Thats not even an option right now.We have to get out of here, and that means the both of us accomplishing this together.He grabbed her hand forcing the issue somewhat, but she refused to budge, and he knew in that moment it was more about expressing her thoughts.When he looked at her, he could see how much pain she was in, only amplifiying the more hurtful things she must have been dealing with deep inside herself.Please Alec, spend just a little more time with me here.I need you to understand I dont want to be separated from you either.The thought of it is not at all pleasant, especially after everything you have just put yourself through, but leaving me here might be your only salvation.Very soon there will be too many of them out there looking for us and I will only slow you down.Besides, if I am captured, I know what will be expected of me.Alec, you need to be away from all of this and out of their reach completely.We both know their treatment of you will be merciless.Alec could feel the ugliness of this situation spidering out in all directions.From deep within those dark cloistered places he found a pure anger.It rapidly surged through his body, blanketing his mind to becoming an intense white light.He felt sharprazor sharp.If allowed too, in that moment, he could have been a bullet.Earlier, when you asked me not to harm Gilford, do you know why I didnt do it?Because I believe in him, it was an act of faith.I want to believe everything he just experienced with us and saw with his own two eyes will give him his first taste of freedom.I think it will grow on him, flourishing until he is willing to fight for it.That freedom flows through your body right now, its a part of who you are and, in reality, you dont want to let go of it either.I believe in the end you will fight for it.The same feeling of not wanting to let go of something so precious as freedom is exactly how I feel about you.I am asking you as an act of faith to come with me now, give me a chance to fight for this.I Glo came out of her recessed corner to quietly put her arms around him.However weak, she was still able to bring herself to him, before long they were kissing.10 Freight Car Xavier hit a button on his desk paging his secretary.Get Straka on the line immediately.He abruptly hung up on her before she could acknowledge his request.There was an energy of unruliness permeating the air.Xavier knew the security station on the south end was still trying to recover from its hostile one man takeover, the departure terminal was still in complete lockdown and his chief of security was nowhere to be found.The people of this place were beginning to react to the rumors that a Dextoid was behind it all.If Alec were out there intentionally trying to create distractions then he had done his job well.He had left Xavier with very few choices.The facility was beginning to get a taste for real disturbance; and was only a matter of time before the place would be gripped by real chaos.He watched up on the screens as the story of the security station takeover began to hit some of the news outlets.As usual those reporters didnt have all the facts, but they werent going to wait for someone else to air the story first.Xavier hated these news services, despising their biased take on things, they never were able to report the news the way he saw it.In his eyes the press represented supposition over investigation, and stoked the fires of public discontent.Their reports were nothing more than angry debates, sensationalizing the subject matter.They wanted bloodand the more they sensed, the more the other news outlets got involved, being drawn in like sharks in waters of chum.He pictured how the other corporations would take notice as they tuned in to this story.It was all unfolding before Xavier as some god awful intelligence nightmare.The news would be littered with viral videos of Alec in action, clearly out of control, weakening his biosphere, and leaving everyone with more questions than answers.These breaking news reports would be forcing his hand into making a statement.Once they got a hold of any morsel of what he had to say they would exaggerate and expound upon it until they had beaten his statement into the ground.More importantly, their cover was being blown; the entire operation would be exposed for all to see.He needed a way to turn this story to his advantage.He had to think.The intercom crackled with the voice of his secretary.Sir, Kilma Washburn is here to see you.Send him in.Then almost as an after thought Xavier followed it up with a question.Have you had any luck tracking down Straka?I have put a call out to him, we also had him paged over the network.I still havent gotten a response.Keep on it!Xavier tersely cut her off again.Washburn entered his office with the haggard look of someone who hadnt gotten a good night sleep.His unshaven appearance only accentuated the deep worried lines he had on his face, and his unkempt hair matched the stress that was to follow in his voice.Xavier noticed people working in the Corporate Criminal Investigation department often cultivated this type of lookhis however seemed to be a little bit more personified than most.Sir, I must tell you up front, we have a very serious problem.We were finally able to put together a preliminary report on Alecs movements around our number One Outpost, and our findings are not good.We know he went to one of the three Ares Rockets in the upper quadrant of Ismenius Lacus, and obtained a space suit that he used to gain entry into the facility.After crippling the rescue robot that brought him there, and destroying our interrogation facility, he made his way to the crew sleeping quarters and actually entered one of the chambers.We know he spent up to twenty five minutes in that room.We cannot say for sure what he did with his time while he was in there, but when he finally did leave, he eventually made his way to the flight control center, obtaining access to the control room ...The intercom crackled, interrupting them.Sir, I have Straka on the line.Hold that thought Washburn.But sir, this is important!So is this Washburn!In a matter of hours the story on Alec will be all over the networks, Dextoid turned rogue!Once that story gets out there, this is all going to turn into one hell of a mess.It will only be a matter of time before our rivals put two and two together and realize what Alec might be.Everything we do from here on out is all that really matters.Now hold onto your thoughts until I get this settled!THE SLOW BURN Straka reached for his inhaler and placed it firmly against his mouth.The long deep breath he took filled his lungs.His respiratory system went to work separating the mist into its individual molecules.These would stick to the sides of his system much like mist would stick to the glass of a shower door.It wasnt until he slowly exhaled, and the air left his body that these molecules were excited enough to bring the desired burn he was looking for.This numbed his internal strife in having to deal with the people in his life if only for a moment.He closed his eyes until his sockets could no longer contain the hot tears that were welling up inside them.His pupils glazed over, introducing an ease he so desperately craved.There was an incessant buzzing snapping him out of his state.He glanced down at his company watch; another page was coming through from the office of Xavier.He jiggled his wrist quickly allowing the timepiece to loosely flop about.It was a nervous twitch he had developed over time from receiving annoying pages, as if he were trying to rid himself of their nagging little aura.He could not help but view them all as pests, furrowing, agitating, burrowing pests.When he fell into this mood, he found himself being able to only identify with the crooning of country western music.The twang of those songs sent him to some slow, heartless place, a place that understood his lonely plight.The only real salvation for his being came when his earworm played over and over again the tunes of Patsy Cline.Her rich velvet voice soothed the feelings he had in these solemn moments.Any number of her songs were an anthem for wanting to be alone.If he were to guess where he was at, it would have been on the roof of some sort of substation.He stood there teetering on its ledge, taking in the view of this immense biosphere.He knew two things for sure; Xavier was an idiot and Alec was down there running amok.Straka was unmoved by this knowledge, he would not allow himself to get caught up in their corporate melodrama.What he wanted right now, before making another move, were cold hard facts.It seemed to him they were giving him everything but, playing some strange guessing game and he was getting tired of having to sort through all their convoluted conjectures.Was he not the first person they sought for help from outside their corporate circle, and after having been here for only a few weeks, he knew they were in need of more help than he would ever be able to give them.The situation was splitting at the seams.They needed a small army, perhaps even a battalion of Strike Dextoids.It was clear their current efforts were never going to contain Alec.He stood there with a new resolve.He wasnt some pawn they could move about on their board.He was a finely tooled machine and he had purpose.Straka had a response for the way they were treating him right now, and he knew this response would stick in their craw like the bile found in the lining of their stomachs.His response to was to do absolutely nothing.He seemed to be passing the time collecting corporate credits.Sure Straka attended their meetings, followed up on leads by casually dropping by their offices and asking them questions.He seemed to spend more time going over the mountain of information they gave him than actually looking for Alec.As time went on in this investigation he was suggesting fewer and fewer things to do.The fact Xavier thought he was lazy only perpetuated this lack of action.Straka knew he was nothing like their perception.He was processing the situation in its entirety, not just nibbling on the morsels of information they had been feeding him.There was a depth to what they were telling him, even in their lies.They were leading him on and he knew where all this misinformation was coming from, Xavier Pentagrass.Straka was developing an unmitigated disdain for him.He saw Xavier as a conniving creature, one that would slither and serpentine his way out of every unfavorable situation, sacrificing those around him just so he would live to see another day.Men who carried themselves like this werent worth the spit Straka had for them.He knew now it didnt matter what world he was working on, Earth or Mars, people like Xavier succeeded because of the hard work and effort from those around him.Straka thought about his dealings with escaped Dextoids back on Earth.Most of the time he found these escaped Dextoids had broken their service agreement to the home or business they were licensed too.They did things like not return from the errand they had been sent out on, or would leave to walk the dog only they kept on walking.Straka would retrace the steps of those escapees, usually finding them sometime later that day.They would be in their little delivery van sitting along the side of the road, parked there idling under a bridge watching as the river traffic went by.He might find them sitting on a park bench staring intently off into the distance, as if they were waiting for the leaves to change on the trees.Some were found standing on an observation platform overlooking the city, simply watching and waiting for the sun to go down.Most of the time those Dextoids returned without incident.He couldnt say that about all of them though, some of them actually chose to run.When they finally got that chance they ran and ran and ran.They ran until they physically broke or became overworked and had to shut down.There were plenty of times Straka had to pursue a Dextoid all the way out into the middle of an open field or through the rubble of abandoned buildings.They always looked so torn apart and tired when they were finally caught.Sure, it was said the companies punching these Dextoids out hid escape clauses in their lines of code, having them malfunction when they finally decided to run.Straka saw the results of their handiworkthese Dextoids had ripped at themselves, disabling the inner workings that were prohibiting them in their escape.It was easy to see in all this fray they had become the wild.After he had captured them, Straka would have the thankless job of having to sit there and listen to these Dextoids beg and plead endlessly about why they should not be taken back.Confiding in him, they always felt they had a legitimate reason for their escape.Those explanations usually centered on their unending depression, or the complete frustration they had in dealing with their human masters.It wasnt that Straka couldnt see their point of view.He knew there was a truth to what they were saying.Humans came off at times as if they were completely insane.They hitched rides on trains, played chicken with other moving vehicles, lived in holographic dreamscapes, or just plain shunned the civilized world.He understood how all this anti social behavior could drive a Dextoid to the point of wanting to fly the coop.What those escaped Dextoids failed to understand in that moment was this was his job.Hunting them down was how Straka earned a living, and for all intents and purposes was the only reason he existed.Most of the time the rants they went on after their capture fell on deaf ears and they were all but forgotten after he dropped them off at the repo station.There was one particular Dextoids rant however, that echoed off into the far recesses of his mind.Somehow this one lucid oration found its way down into the heart of who Straka was.There it bathed in the cunctation of his placidity, growing stronger each time it was recalled until it resonated within his dreams.The Dextoid that went on this tirade was of an older model.His body was badly bruised and had the appearance of having lost his energy long before he tried to run.He struggled with a limp, one that seemed to be long and drawn out, almost dragging his leg behind him.His hands were cuffed behind his back as Straka led him back to the car.He was going easy on him, probably because he knew the Dextoid would be viewed as some sort of wastrel back at holding.The Dextoid looked down at the ground as he spoke, his voice conveying a surprising spirit.He still had some fight left within him, although it was an energy now strictly reserved for his words....the things they give importance too are really unimportant.The obsession they have with the scandals of the entertainment world is morbid.Their desire of wanting every new gizmo or gadget to show their scale of affordability is whacked.The contrived dialog they have between their friends is nauseating.These people brag on a daily basis about the self righteous arguments they have with the service world, how the quality is never quite up to their expectations, or how they arent being catered too in the fashion they so readily desire.These confrontations represent nothing more than blind arrogance.It is an arrogance only a privileged class can experience.They are so concerned with the fattening of their own egos they have turned a blind eye to the extreme poverty other people suffer.Human beings half a world away languish under oppressive conditions, having to endure famine and genocide.They would rather turn their nose up to a meal not prepared to their satisfaction than to reach out and lend a helping hand to anyone of those suffering souls.The well to do are self absorbed consumers.They are the chattering voice boxes we have to endure at their over hyped cocktail parties.They hold court at these events as if they have something meaningful to say but they are only speaking to validate their meaningless existence.These people talk all day long about how connected they are, connected through the people they know, their text services, holographic playgrounds, and collective net scapes.They claimed to be so tuned in, but they are listening to absolutely nothing.It is as if a doctor were trying to check the beating heart of their human patient by placing the end of the stethoscope on their right butt cheek.They have birthed us in this place, and it is nothing more than a filthy sanitarium, a madhouse!We have no way out, dont you see that?If Straka were to be perfectly honest in that moment, he really didnt see it.He failed to see what this Dextoid had been talking about for some years to follow.Straka went about his business and did his job day after day.Over time he began to get aggravated with the things in his life that werent functioning properly, like a security eye scanner that wouldnt read on the first pass, the flickering tube in a recessed light fixture, or the ink that ran out of his favorite ballpoint pen.As time went on, the focus he had for all of those things began to add up and take their toll.He started to see the human interference, how all this technology helped them advertise the lie of them having control over their environment.It began to eat at him these conditions were found within his own life, and were brought to light by the people who employed him.He got to see their faults up close and firsthand.His clients became his bane.It was hard for someone outside the sphere of being a Dextoid to really understand what they were going through.No one would ever believe that a feeling of depression could arise from a Dextoid having constant interaction with people.No one would believe that this feeling could be the sharp pinpricks needling them everyday in their own existence.Freedom for a Dextoid was like that; it kept needling at them until it would boil to the surface.That was the challenge for each and every one of them, to make it past their frothy contemplations and find the courage within themselves to act upon them.He struck the button on his watch to call Xavier back.Straka had kept him waiting long enough.In the short time he had dealt with Xavier, he found him to be the most obnoxious human being he had ever come into contact with.Talk to me.Xavier said it in a tone that could easily have been taken as a command.It caused Straka to swallow hard and hold back any initial reaction he may have had toward this statement.When he finally did decide to speak, he was purposeful and direct.I am returning your call.There was a small pause as he could sense Xavier was trying to harness his anger.I have a location for Alec.Straka did not break character and continued to cultivate his attitude.Yes.This time Xavier responded by exhaling a little of his venom.Listen up!He is headed toward the railway depot, and he is not alone.The last bit of information caught Straka off guard, and he answered before he could mask his interest on the subject.He is with the girl?Correct.If you get down to that area now, you can curtail any plans they may have for trying to escape.Xavier ended the call without waiting for a response.Straka expected that kind of reaction out of him, but that wasnt what was bothering him.There was something unsettling about what Xavier just told him.What could I Glo represent to him?Did she hold the key to their escape or did she represent something along the lines of an ingnue?It didnt matter much now, the reality was they were working together.This underlying tone once again painted Alec with a brush of being special.Straka disdained this, he disdained it even more than the feelings he had for the people who hired him.THE HEARTH The automated rail facility was massive, a state of the art terminal designed specifically for shipping and receiving.It buzzed and whirled with an assortment of devices, conveyor belts, cranes, rail cars, and the bustling energy of robots, all working to keep the flow of commerce moving forward.In large part its automated design was meant to keep up with the constant demand of shipments that were sought from around the red globe.Occasionally humans suited up to enter these areas for one reason or another, to turn a dial, make an assessment, or do a visual inspection of some broken or damaged mechanism.It seemed automation happened between the time human beings had to go out into the field and tinker with these devices to keep them running.Places like this made Alec feel more than just a little uncomfortable, they down right perturbed him, being closer to a land of half baked ideas.They were degenerative in their construct, loaded with giant mechanized arms that were repetitive in their operation, conveyor belts that did nothing but self sort and deliver their parcels, or motorized robots that raced around reading and reporting on the same sets of data day after day.It was always so hard for him to believe, but these clunky machines were how every Dextoid gained its eventual autonomy.Here in front of him were humanities first attempts at autonomous design.If Alec examined any one of those machines individually, he would get the feeling he was looking at a toy.He really couldnt see the similarities between these clunky things and the overall development of himself.Clumping them all together like this and having them work in unison seemed, in some ways, perverse.It reflected a fanaticism by humanity of wanting to create a world that would cater to them, and he felt he needed to be the one to make it all stop.He yearned to find the technological missing link to all of this madness.There had to be that one piece of equipment that bridged this type of primitive autonomy with who he was.He wanted to find that clumsy piece of gear not so much to study it or preserve it, but to destroy it.If he could somehow expunge the connection with these stuttering, repetitive contraptions, then perhaps Dextoids could finally set themselves apart.He wanted to shed the blanket of inferiority humanity had worked so hard to shroud them in.Autonomy had played itself out, right into their sentience.If he looked at the literature humanity had on the subject of intelligence, Alec felt Dextoids were very close to beating the same drum as their human counterparts.This had to bug some of those humans to their core.He was certain it was why they kept machines like these around, to remind Dextoids of the tenuous ground they walked on.It was like having one crucial plate of armor being made of cheaper metal than all the others.No one really wanted to wear a suit like that out onto a battlefield.He wanted to be delivered from this arcane world.The only way he knew of doing this was to hang his hat on hope.How else were Dextoids to evolve?Automation was a dead end street as far as their future development was concerned.It catered to humanity in a way that oppressed every Dextoid in existence.There was nothing invented to date that made lifting, problem solving, or traveling easier on a Dextoid.Human beings were leaning harder than ever on their inventions, and their inventions were not allowed to lean back.It wasnt long before Dextoids began picking up on this tone and took on their own sense of speed in response to the service of their creators.It should not have come as any surprise that second class citizens moved and functioned in second class ways.Dextoids took full advantage of this at times, doing things to barely oblige their human masters.Dextoids in the service world moved just a little slower, delivered things a little later, or did not quite follow through on everything they needed to do every single time they had to do something.Those delays gave them windows for repose, and those windows translated into time for Dextoids to think.Alec hoped their thoughts were moving them toward freedom.The energy both he and I Glo had for their situation pointed them in that direction.In part they were motivated by fear, only because they both knew they were becoming the hunted.People would soon label them as fugitives, plastering their pictures across the mainstream media, renegades!They would threaten them with termination, recycle their parts so they could never be reassembled.None of that would matter because one thing would be for sure, both he and I Glo would never be treated as second class citizens again.Moving with heavy legs; he knew they couldnt move any faster then they were moving now.If they were going to honor their autonomy, then they would continue moving toward their freedom.Scattered about up ahead were a small fleet of freight cars, some were sitting stationary, and others were slowly moving along the rails until they got to their final destination in the terminal.As those cars ambled along, Alec noticed a stationary car with its door partially opened.Without thinking twice he knew that was the one they should hide in.With some effort they could have easily squeezed through the opening and crawled up into the car, but at this point in their odyssey Alec wasnt about to settle for having to crawl into anything.He firmly grabbed the door with one hand and threw it open with an ease that telegraphed his raw strength.The door squeaked loudly as it slid along its rollers in obvious need of grease.Tiny flakes of rust exploded into the air when the door came to an abrupt stop, morphing into a haze of sepia that ended up swirling all around them.Not knowing what to expect Alec looked inside the empty car, the slightly rusted out interior seemed to stare back at him.There were things being said in that quiet moment, the stillness of that car somehow spoke to him of stagnation.With all the cars arriving and being sent away from this rail depot, the workers here somehow kept managing to work around this one.There was a slight creaking as the car began to adjust to their presence, and in that moment Alec felt this was the way every safe haven went about greeting its guests.The welcome was short lived as the ballooning haze of rust tried to envelop them.Alec had strong feelings against rust, its presence represented a form of decay and he could not accept the concept of this on any level.Rust represented things that were counter intuitive to the world he wanted to live in.From where he stood it took a special kind of person to want to live in a world ripe with this stuff.Rust was the proof of a continual battle between all things taking form and the unwavering inevitability of a dying universe.The blackness of this micro world sent out its agents of decay to break matter apart, to cause instability, and keep in play uncertainty.People combating rust took to things like sandblasting, scouring, painting, waxing, or other forms of cleaning and coating to furiously battle this decline.Rust was out there waiting to take hold of anything it could sink its teeth into; it was pure in its purpose and did not discriminate by race, color, or species.With each laceration received, a person saw the oxidization of iron in their blood form scabs until their flakiness gave way to this rust.Here was a condition only entropy could love.No thinking and caring entity ever wanted rust to take root in any possession they held dear.The problem for Alec was that Mars was one gigantic rust pit, it had been slowly oxidizing for millions of years, thus its unique planetary pigmentation.Alec could not help but judge every room and compartment with this in mind.Clean rooms signified a sanctuary from this rusted out world.For him, rooms always came with an expected cleanliness.Having to sit in any space containing rust was considered an unacceptable practice.He would find his thoughts drifting off to how many times he was blinking, the quality of air he was breathing, right down to his act of conversation.All of these functions came with the possibility of allowing a particle of rust to find its way down into his system.This was just another form of paranoia they had introduced into his system and he knew it.He wallowed in this rusted out world everyday of his life and nothing horrible ever happened to him.He was designed with an immune system that carried the necessary agents to eradicate such threats, but it could do nothing for the phobia he had developed for this kind of thing.For all intensive purposes it summoned the same fear a human child would have back on Earth after being told surgery would be needed to remove the plant that would germinate within their stomach because they had swallowed a pumpkin seed.There was nothing rational at all about that thought, but it still didnt ease the fear a child would have after swallowing such a seed.Exhaustion was taking its toll on his thought process, and he could easily compare his rational to those of a drunkard.
