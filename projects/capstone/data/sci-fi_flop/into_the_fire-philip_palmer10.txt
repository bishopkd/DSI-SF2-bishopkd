The reason was all too obvious: her artificial legs and arms were lined up and plugged into the top of this machine, hands and feet in the air, maybe recharging in some way.Just for a moment the sight of her, naked and limbless, squirming across that floor, left me at a loss, not knowing how to react, but I recovered sufficiently to squeeze a laser blast between her and her prosthetics.She lost balance and toppled to the floor, lying there without a stitch.You, I growled, turning to Dr.Simon.His face was white as his shirt.I should kill you here and now.I had no choice!he told me, as if hed been waiting all this time to explain.As soon as they knew about Lena, they wouldnt leave me alone And how did they find out?Youve got to!Its the law!he started to babble, but Nora Jagger shut him down at once.How the fuck did you get in here?she demanded.I gotta say, in real life that face was even harder and meaner than it looked on the screen.Her eyes stabbed into mine and I swear I could almost physically feel their invasionI never seen such ugliness of character, of spirit.Ive spent my life mixing with the callous, the crazy, the psychotic and the damned, but almost every one of them had something, a redeeming feature, no matter how small.With her you just knew there was nothing.She was evil jam packed into a truncated body that she herself had brutally abused, lopping off pieces to make herself more fearsome, more able to perform the sick acts conjured up by her toxic imagination.How the fuck dyou think I got in here?I spat back.She was simmering so violently I almost expected her to explode; not just at me for getting in there, but also at the Specials who shouldve prevented it.Though what I think she was most angry about was the fact that Id managed to catch her at such a vulnerable moment, without her limbs attached Where is she?I demanded.Who?she asked, every word spat at me like it was tipped with poison.Lena, Dr.Simon informed her.Ohhh!she cried, breaking into the cruelest of smiles, shifting position so she could prop her body up against a chair, apparently not in the least bit concerned by her nakedness.Clancy!Come for the little woman.Where is she?I repeated, snarling the question directly into Dr.Simons face.He looked frightened enough to tell me, but I couldnt put the fear of God into him the way she could.You tell him, Ill rip you apart, she threatened, starting with your insides and working out.She meant it.I actually saw him buckle at the knees, his suave, confident demeanor gone in an instant, and it wouldnt have surprised me if hed peed those perfect pants of his.I looked at her, then back at him, neither seeming of a mind to say anything and I thought the time had come to take matters into my own hands.Without another word, I shot the glass outta the window and as smoke crept into the room, walked over to the line of artificial limbs in the machine, selected an arm and gave it a tug.I thought theyd be plugged in somehow, but when I drew it out I saw it was actually just resting in a container of gray cellulose like sludge that now dripped heavily onto the floor.Even worse, the arm socket that had been in the liquid was pulsing slightly, almost as if it was alive.I didnt care for that at all, and instead of threatening her with what I might do with it, I thought about just throwing it out the window as an example of what Id do with the others.No!Nora Jagger screamed, seeing my intention.Dont you fucking dare!Where is she?I repeated, and she glared at me as if shed never been so angry with anyone in her life.Youd better kill me!she hissed, while youve got the chance!Tell me!I shouted, leaning out the window, hanging onto her artificial hand like there was a body attached, threatening to let go.She paused for a moment, thinking it through, trying to find an angle, but too distracted by me holding her arm like that.Ill show you, she eventually conceded.He shows me, I told her.You stay here.Finally she gave way.I hope shes fucking worth it, she said, those chillingly pale, goat like eyes promising how brutal her revenge would be.I presume theres another way outta here?I asked the doc.He turned to Nora Jagger.She glared daggers at me one last time, then reluctantly nodded, giving her assent.Tie her up, I told him.You could see how scared he wasthe whole time he was doing it he was visibly shaking.I got him to help her up and sit her in a chair, then secure her with bandages from his bag, covering him with my laser to make sure he did a good job.She cursed evilly and endlessly, most of it directed at me, but also at the doc and the Specials outside, leaving no doubt what shed do to all of us if she ever got the chance.I gotta say, the range and venom of it, it was pretty hard to ignore.She got herself into a real crazy frothing frenzy, cursing and spitting, until eventually I decided Id had enough and stuck a couple of plasters over her mouth.I didnt want to hear that, and I didnt think the doc did either.She shouldve been locked away long ago, or maybe put to sleep; anything other than having someone like her at large in the community.I wouldntve admitted it, but I gotta say, her ranting did rattle me a bit, so much so, in fact, that I decided to hang onto that arm of hers, ignoring the fact that it was still dripping gray sludge, figuring that in terms of trying to escape, it would put her at one helluva disadvantage.Lets go, I said to Dr.Simon.And you try anything, Im really gonna enjoy blowing your brains out all over that expensive shirt.He led me to this door hidden behind a screen.It was only as I was about to follow him through that I glanced back and noticed a further door in the corner.I hesitated for a moment, then went to take a quick look, just in case.It was a games room, with full wall screens, but there was no one in there and I left without giving it another thought.The doc took me down what I guessed was a VIP emergency escape route, constantly turning around and glancing back like he expected to see Nora Jagger coming after us at any moment.Shes not gonna find her way outta that any time soon, I reassured him.I hope not, he muttered, unable to stop himself taking yet another glance back.Ive never seen her that angry.You caught her the one time she has her prosthetics off.Thats why there were guards on the door.Normally she wouldnt remove them for any reason.I dont know if it was cuz I was distracted or what, but we turned a blind corner and suddenly came face to face with a couple of Specialssomeone had obviously remembered the escape route and sent them in the other way.I didnt give them time to draw their weaponsnor me mineI just swung at them with the only thing available, which was Nora Jaggers arm.Jeez, I didnt know what that thing was made of, but it sure packed a punch; both of them ended up on the ground, laid out cold by the arm of a woman who was tied up a couple of corridors back.I turned around, half expecting to see Dr.Simon making a run for it, but he was cowering in the corner, his main concern apparently whether hed messed up his fancy clothes or not.Come on, I ordered.For a while we kinda half walked, half jogged, in silence; he was still occasionally glancing back, but I could also sense him turning things over, weighing up the situation.Lenas fine, he told me, plainly trying to ingratiate himself.You dont have to worry about that.Pardon me if I dont believe a word you say.Listen!For Gods sake!You saw her!he cried, obviously referring to Nora Jagger.She frightens the hell out of me!I was tempted to concede the point, but however much I agreed about how scary that woman was, I sure as hell wasnt gonna let him off that easily.A pregnant woman?I sneered, like he should be ashamed of himself, being a doctor and all.He went quiet for a moment and I thought maybe he was feeling guilty, reciting that Hippocratic Oath to himself, but I was wrong; he had a much bigger surprise for me.Its not just that, is it?he said.What dya mean?He paused midstride and stared into my face.You do know, dont you?he asked.I know everything, I told him, dragging him on.I know about the satellites, people being poisoned, Infinity trying to hush it up.And probably, cuz Lena lived in the tunnels all those years, that her and the babys organs are worth a fortune.He never commented, just looked as if he was waiting for me to say more, and I began to feel uneasy.What?And?What dya mean, and?You dont know, do you?he asked.Jeez, why were people always saying stuff like that to me?I couldnt help being a dumb old big guy.Did I ever pretend to be anything else?I turned and gave him a real hostile flash of the look.Living underground hasnt just kept her healthy, Clancy, its kept her uncompromised.I know that!I replied impatiently.He still wasnt telling me anything new.Shes a healthy, young, pregnant woman, he said, emphasizing each and every word.Thank God for that, I commented....The only one.Now it was my turn to pause midstride.What dyou mean?There are no others.I stared into his face, searching for an angle, a way he was trying to trick me.Youre lying.No!I promise you, as far as we knowin the City anywaythere hasnt been a successful pregnancy for several years.I dragged him on again, resuming our hurried progress, trying to pretend I was unimpressed when in fact I was utterly overwhelmed.Jesus!Gigi had mentioned something about seeing no babiesthat was the reason: there were none.So what were you planning on doing?I asked.He shrugged, like there was only one rational course of action.Deliver the babyall those healthy genes, stem cellsand sperm!Think of all that wonderful fertile sperm Jesus Christ!I protested.Its a boy, he told me.I guessed that, I said, knowing that at some point that might be a cause for celebration.You cant take her, Clancy!You owe it to humankind Go fuck yourself, I said, not believing Id once had so much respect for that man.Please!he begged, but I just shoved him on.He lapsed into silence, leading me down yet another corridor, plainly still deep in thought.I was just starting to get that bit impatient, to wonder if he was up to something, when he stopped at a door much like the one that had led off Nora Jaggers quarters.And ya wanna know something?This time I could actually feel Lena, I could smell her, the second the door slid open.I started to shake, telling myself I had to be careful, that it was everything I maintained my concentration: now would be the worst time of my life to make a mistake.I entered as cautiously as I could, checking the room for any suspicion of an ambush, completely ignoring the figure I could feel lying on the bed til finally I simply couldnt do it anymore.She was just lying there, unquestionably tranquilized, staring at me as if she was unable to take it in, her wrists electronically clamped at her side.Clancy?she whispered, like she couldnt believe it, that it was just another dream.I switched off the locks, allowing myself to give her just the briefest of hugs.As much as I wanted to live that moment, to kiss her, hold her, even cry a tear or two, I knew it was everything that we got away.Come on, I said, helping her out of bed, relieved to find her dressed.Whats that?she asked dazedly, frowning at Nora Jaggers arm.I just shook my head; explanations would have to wait for later.Lets go.Where?I turned and glared at Dr.Simon.Hell show us.The doc took us out a different door, down another of those interminable long corridors and through some heavy double doors into a ward I instantly had a bad reaction to.My first thought, with the line of beds in front of me, was that it was a recovery room, but then I noticed other things: bars on the windows, equipment and apparatus that looked in no way beneficial to anyones health.People had been tortured therein fact, if I listened real closely, I swear I could hear them still screaming.What the hell is this place?I asked, but the doc ignored me, heading toward the door at the far end of the room.I dont know if it was the place that distracted me, or maybe cuz Lena was still a little groggy and leaning her warm body against mine, but I mustve had a momentary lapse of concentration, cuz the doc saw his opportunity and suddenly, instead of being a couple of paces in front of us, was a dozen or more.At first it didnt seem like a disaster, just a pathetic attempt to escape, but Id underestimated the guy.The reason hed been so deep in thought was cuz hed been planning how to lure us into a trap.He started shouting at the top of his voice, so excited that at first I couldnt understand what he was saying, and nor could the voice recognition system either, not until he slowed down and his words became that bit clearer.Lockdown!Lockdown!he screamed, and heavy bars descended from the ceiling, creating various different compartments in the room, with us in the central one and him in the one with the door.I dropped Nora Jaggers prosthetic arm, fumbling for my laser, intending to force him to free us, but he was out of that room surprisingly quickly.Im sorry!he called back, once he was outside.You cant take her!You dont have the right!Come back here!I shouted, but already I could hear his running footsteps fading up the corridor.Shit!I cursed.No!Lena wailed, I shouldve remembered this wasnt the way out!You been here before?They brought me here after I tried escaping.Dont worry, she said, seeing the reaction on my face, they didnt do much.Too scared of harming the baby.I paused for a moment.You know?Yeah...Sorry, she said, as if even amongst all that was happening, it shouldve been acknowledged.And there, trapped in a torture chamber in the Infinity building, with God knows who on their way, we actually took a moment to briefly unite in celebration over what wed created.I know that might sound a little crazy when we had far more pressing problems to deal with, but that was what we did.How do we get out of here?I asked, as we reluctantly broke away from each other.Lena just sighed and shook her head: it was hopeless, and I guess Id known before Id asked the question.Out of sheer frustration I picked up Nora Jaggers artificial arm and swung it at the bars, and was amazed to see one buckle slightly.Jesus, what is that thing made of?I swung again, this time bending the bar substantially.I was about to try once more, to give it everything I had, when a group of Specials came running down the corridor and into the room.I had no choice.Even though Id drawn my laser, I knew there was no way I could get involved in a fire fight, not with Lena and the baby right next to me.Let it go, one of the Specials told me.Nice and easy.With a sigh I dropped it, the laser clattering to the floor.Kick it under the bars.I kicked it with such frustration that it shot across the room and kinda lodged under an air conditioning unit.Dr.Simon peered around the frame of the doorway, making sure it was safe before reentering.To be fair to the guy, he didnt look that pleased with himself.This is much bigger than you two, he muttered, seemingly more to himself than anyone.I was about to tell that slimy bastard exactly what I thought of him, what Id do if I ever got the chance, when I heard another sound approaching down the corridor.At first I couldnt believe itit couldnt be, not here.And yet those familiar clanking pneumatic footsteps, the slurp slurp of every stride, it couldnt be anything else.There was a growler approaching.I turned to Lena, noticing as I put my arm around her that her eyes were almost clear of whatever shed been given.Or maybe it was just fear shining through...And yet, as the footsteps drew closer, it occurred to me that there was something different about themno less frightening, and in fact, when I looked around I could see the Specials were every bit as intimidated as we were.They sounded less busy, less repetitive somehow, and it soon struck me why; whatever it was wasnt moving on four legs but two.It wasnt a growler at allbut I reckon I mightve preferred it if it had been.I guess its a similar technology, maybe it was even where she got the idea: the way those things can instantly rend flesh and bone into nothing is probably something she admires.Nora Jagger came striding into the room and I gotta say, if shed been unnerving before, naked and without prosthetics, she was utterly terrifying now.Those eyes damn near bored through me with their white heat, and her scowl wouldve sent the sun screaming back to the horizon.She never said a word, just glared at me as she gestured to one of the Specials to release the lockdown.The bars rose and she walked over, snatching her artificial arm away.I tell ya, it was the weirdest thing.She just pushed it up the empty sleeve of her coat, with no ceremony at all, and as it got close to the stump of her arm it almost seemed to come to life, like some kind of animal wriggling up there, going into its hole.You must be the biggest fool ever, she told me.Did you really think you were just going to come waltzing in here and take your little maid?Im the father of the child!I blurted out, like it gave me the right to do whatever I wanted.Yeah, well, lets hope it doesnt inherit your brain, she said, checking her arm, that it felt right.Apparently satisfied, she whirled around, scanning the room, as if, now that she was whole again, she had a little business to attend to.Who was in charge of guarding my quarters?she asked.For the first time I noticed the older Special, the one Id sneaked past while hed been looking out the window.He wasnt gonna answer her, you could see that.He was one of five lined up a little like they were on parade, that she began to circle around, glaring into their faces, waiting for one of them to crack.When it happened, it was so swift, so brutal, it took your breath away.She suddenly lurched forward, grabbed the older guy and spun him around, getting him in a full nelson.The others panicked, scrambling outta the way, presumably cuz theyd seen similar scenes before.But I hadnt.Jesus!Ill never forget it as long as I live.She just squeezed and squeezed, with those incredibly powerful arms of hers, and at first the guy was bewilderingly silent, almost compliantthen he began to scream, to squeal like a pig being butchered.You could hear the crack as both his arms came out of their sockets, as his body began to break apart, but she hadnt finished with him yet.She just kept on applying pressure, those prosthetic arms locked at the back of his neck, pushing him down, doubling him over, til eventuallyand God help me, Ill never get the image outta my mindthe flesh and bone simply gave way.His head detached from his shoulders and plopped on down onto the floor, rolling a little ways then stopping, briefly rocking back and forth.There were muffled cries and gasps and one of the Specials looked away, retching repeatedly, and Lena and me took refuge in each others arms.Clear it away!Nora Jagger barked, then turned back to me, her sudden smile making her even more repulsive.Get the picture?she asked.I never replied but I discreetly shuffled away from Lena.I was the one under threat and I didnt want to put her at risk.Anyways, what could I say?All the things Ive seen in my life, the bad old days, even the very worst atrocities, were as nothing compared to this.This was violence of an order I could never have even imagined.And yet no matter how shocked I was, how concerned Id be next, it still hadnt distracted me from the question that had reared up in my mind the moment Nora Jagger had entered the room: how the hell had she got free so quickly?Id checked those bandages myself; there was no way she was going anywhere, and the door to the outer corridor had been jammed shut.We shouldve been well away before anyone was able to release her.I just didnt get itand being the witch she was, she read it in my eyes.Yeah, like I said, none too bright, she sneered.You shouldve searched my quarters properly...I had a guest.I cursed to myself as my thoughts immediately went to that games room.A friend of mine, she told me, ...and yours.She waited for me to say something, but I didnt have a clue what she was talking about.Come on in, my little stool pigeon!she called to someone obviously out in the corridor, breaking into yet another wickedly self satisfied smile.Or should that be...seagull?It was one of those moments when youre so shocked your brain simply refuses to handle it.I just gaped at the door, staring at who was standing there, desperate for everything to go on rewind.Gigi came shuffling in, not looking at me but still exuding a certain air of defiance.Oh, Jeez!I groaned, collapsing inside as I instantly recognized that I shouldve known.She always had that slight air of mystery about her; always knew way too much for someone whod only been off the Island the same amount of time we had.Her story about being recruited by one of the guys off the garbage boats had sounded plausible, and maybe it was true; the only thing was, at some point shed obviously been recruited by Infinity as well.No wonder she wouldnt tell us where she lived, and why she was so cagey about the organization shed joined.She had friends on the inside, all rightright at the very top.Why?I asked her.It was the obvious question, but I shouldve known how shed answerwith one of her all too typical shrugs.When times are tough, Nora Jagger chipped in, peoplell sell anything.Even their soul.And lay down with the devil?One day maybe, she smirked, giving Gigi one of the creepiest looks Ive ever seen.You make me sick, lady, I told her.Oh, Ill make you more than that, she promised, practically licking her lips in anticipation.I knew she was gonna take revenge for what I did, especially messing with her prosthetics; I also guessed that, no matter how old, I was still a big guy, and she was gonna enjoy putting on another demonstration of her strength.I glanced around the room, clocking her various sinister looking toys, the many methods of torture, wondering what she had in mind.Oh, I wont be needing them, she assured me.Just your bare hands, I sneered.She mustve been at least ten feet away, but I got an immediate illustration of just how powerful those legs were when she kinda bounced at me, made this pneumatic spring and suddenly was right in my face; toppling me backward, trying to twist me around and grab me from behind the way she had that Special, but somehow I managed to wriggle free.Lena screamed at her, told her to leave me alone, but you could see she was really in her element.If you hurt him, Ill kill this baby!Lena threatened.How?she asked.Youre going back into clamps and this time you wont be able to move a muscle, not until its born.Ill will it dead!Lena told her.Ill starve myselfIll do everything I can to make it die inside me.Lena!I said, unable to suppress a protest.I dont care, Clancy.You come first.Well feed you intravenously, Nora Jagger told her.And in any case, if this sad old bastard can make you pregnant, therell be others from that island wholl serve just as well.She turned back to me, again that wet lipped smile appearing, and even though Id already had one demonstration of what she could do, she leaped forward so quickly, I barely got out of the way in time.Even so, her outstretched fingers raked a mark across my forehead like Id just fallen headlong into a shredder.Whether I wanted to or not, I was getting a lesson in exactly what those limbs were capable of.So far I knew that her legs could jump, spring, and Id be willing to bet, run further and faster than any animal on this earth, but it was the arms that really worried me.There didnt seem to be any kind of delay between her thinking what she was gonna do and them responding, almost as if they were ahead of her, even adding something of their own.No doubt Jimmy would be able to shine a little light on it, but all I knew was that this lethal hybrid of human and machine was rapidly closing in on me.It didnt take a genius to work out that if I was gonna stop her, I needed to concentrate my efforts on that soft center the doc had been massaging.I tried to get blows in at the points where her limbs met her body, hoping I might dislodge them somehow, but she was way too fast for me.I went for the stomach, try to knock the wind outta her, but again she blocked me and I was forced to back off.I thought I had a pretty good idea what she was capable of, what to expect from her and her limbs, but suddenly she dropped to the floor, balanced on one hand and swept me with her legs.It damn near demolished me.Both my shins and kneecaps felt like theyd been shattered into a thousand tiny pieces and down I went.Before I could recover, shed leaped on me and grabbed me around the neck.Somewhere I could hear screams, cries of No!, but all I knew was the all encompassing force of those arms locked around my throat.I mustve passed out for a second or two, but when I came to, Nora Jagger was sprawled out on the floor in front of me.She didnt look that badly hurt, but had been dumped unceremoniously on her face.I turned around, wondering what the hell had happened, and saw a couple of Specials struggling with Lena, doing their best to restrain her.At her feet was this piece of fairly solid looking machinery, maybe for giving electric shocksbut shed used it as a far more basic form of weapon.Nora Jagger pulled herself up, her expression demanding blood, leaping at Lena and hitting her so hard she flew across the room and collided with the wall.No!Dr.Simon shouted, the baby!I tell ya, I went crazy: throwing punches left and right, swinging and missing, doing everything I could to nail that damn ogress.But it was as if shed put those arms in defense mode, no matter how many punches I threw, they were always in my way, and it wasnt long before I started to puff and blow and had to back off.Immediately she went on the offensive, swinging those prosthetics like sledgehammers, and with such force, all I could do was to dodge or run.A couple of times I wasnt quick enoughit was like being hit by a speeding truck, battered aside by some almighty force.I tried counter punching, using moves I remembered from my old boxing days, concentrating on the body, and maybe it did worry her that bit cuz she suddenly switched to trying to kick me.The first time she did it, she damn near took my head off.She could jump almost as high as the ceiling, her legs scything through the air so fast you could barely see them.I leapt out of her way, backing off, dodging from side to side, but it wasnt long before I was seriously out of breath again.Mind you, to my immense relief, I saw I wasnt the only one, that she needed to stop too.I guess the thing was, no matter how powerful those artificial limbs, they still needed lungs, a heart, whatever, to sustain them.For a moment we both just stood there facing each other, each desperately trying to get air back into our lungs, locked eye to eye, then suddenly she sprang into life again, trying another kick, only this time, I guess cuz she was tiring, when she landed, she slipped and almost went over.I didnt waste any energy retaliating, just concentrated on avoiding what else she was throwing, and she got this triumphant look about her, like she thought it was all over.However, she was a bit premature.I played along with itthe notion that I was utterly spentpuffing and panting, doubling over, and sure enough, she moved in for the kill.She leapt at me again, her foot slicing through the air like a blade, this time managing to catch me on the chest, but again when she hit the floor, she looked a little unsteady.I stumbled back toward the wall with her eagerly chasing after me.Id noticed this high pressure hose behind me, presumably another instrument of torture, and as she leapt into the air again, expecting to strike the final blow, I moved faster than I couldve imagined myself capable of: grabbing the hose and turning it on, training it on her, and just as I hoped, she lost all balance and sprawled out on the wet floor.Before she could recover, I leaped on her and got the hose around her neck, pulling as tightly as I could, watching the fury in those wasteland eyes glazing over as she fought for breath.I guess those Specials were under orders that as a last resort they were allowed to intervene, cuz two of them ran over and tried to wrestle me off her, and when they couldnt, a third hit me over the head with something really heavy.I fell forward but still somehow managed to scramble over toward the laser lodged in the bottom of the air conditioning unit; no one had retrieved it.Id just about got my hand around it when I felt this real hard kick, like my nerve system had been punctured, and I knew someone had stunned me.I was just lying there convulsing when suddenly I felt this wild force lift me up and throw me across the room.Jeez, I tell ya, Im not exactly a lightweight, but I flew over there like a tin roof in a hurricane: twisting and turning until I thudded up against the wall.I tried to scramble up, but not only were my nerve ends arcing, the pain of the impact was somehow tangling with them and I slumped back to the floor, helplessly listening to the approach of those slurping footsteps.Icy blue eyes stared down at me, inspecting me for damage, and plainly she wasnt satisfied yet cuz she kicked me so hard my body skipped across the floor like a pebble over a pond.Again I slammed up against the wall, my shoulder feeling like it mightve been dislocated.Jesus, she was going to reduce me to nothing but red slush and sinewy slime.Lena started screaming out in protest again, struggling, a couple of Specials doing their best to hold her, everyone else was just dodging out of the way whenever I was thrown or kicked in their direction.Gigi and Dr.Simon were in the corner; he was kinda cowering, turning his face away as if refusing to watch, while her eyes were darting around the room, I guessed looking for a way to escape.Those terrifying arms kept reaching for me over and over, and everywhere she threw me my blood appeared to be already there, and each time the light inside me dimmed a little more.She grabbed me again, with a power, a finality, that made me think shed had enough, that she felt the time had come to bring this fucking performance to an end.Lifting me right over her head, she gave out with this cry of victory, ready to toss me across the room, to smash me up against the wall one last time, and I knew that would be it: that my body couldnt take any more.I was aware of being pulled back as if I was about to be catapulted through the air, then there was a sudden gasp, a groan, like some great tree being felled, and Nora Jaggers body tumbled to the floor with mine on top of it.I stirred, tried to get up, but heard the hum of a power pack and realized there was a fire fight going on.The two Specials whod been holding Lena were lying on the ground not far from me, apparently shot, while shed somehow managed to slide away behind a bench.It didnt leave me with a great deal of choice; I just stayed where I was, taking cover behind Nora Jaggers body, those limbs that had battered me moments ago now offering me a measure of protection.But I just didnt get.What the hell was going on?Who was firing?And most of all, whod killed Nora Jagger?There was more shooting, another Special went down and the remaining one decided to make a run for it.I stayed where I was for a few moments, ensuring it was safe, then slowly peered out from behind the body of Nora Jagger.I dont know who I expected to seeJimmy or Gordie maybe?Even Hanna?But the only person in sight was Gigi, hesitantly emerging from behind the air conditioning unit, my laser in her hand.What the hell?I uttered, trying to struggle up, my pain causing me to helplessly lock halfway.Gigi gave me a hand, straightened me up, made sure I could stand.Never trust a double agent, she told me, slipping the laser into my pocket, like she wanted to confirm she was on my side.I still didnt understand, but it obviously wasnt the time for explanations.Clancy!Lena called, emerging from hiding.Are you okay?Actually, I wasnt: I had a mass of cuts and bruises, I could barely move my arm, and my kneecaps felt like theyd been granulated.Nevertheless, I still nodded.You?Im fine, she replied, ignoring the fact that shed just collided heavily with the wall.What about the baby?She couldnt help herself; even amongst everything that was going on she briefly laughed at my conventionality.Lets go, she said, like we had other, far more immediate, things to worry about.Can you walk?I had to lean on her a bit, leaving the odd smear of blood on her clothing, but we managed.Gigi retrieved the lasers of the dead Specials, beckoning Dr.Simon out from his hiding place under a bed.He emerged looking pale and shaken, staring at the mayhem around him, yet still insisting on tucking in his shirt and straightening his tie.We didnt have to say anything to him; he knew he was coming with us whether he wanted to or not.As we left the room I took a quick glance back at the body of Nora Jagger still lying on the floor, surrounded by all her instruments of torture, slain in her palace of pain.It was so hard to believe that someone like her, so formidable, so full of evil energy, should die in such simple fashion.And yet, maybe there was a kind of justice in it: shot in the back by a kid she thought she had in her pocket.I took a few uncomfortable steps along the corridor and then stopped.Whats the matter?Lena asked.Clancy!she protested, when I hobbled back to the ward.Just a second, I told her.I dont know why I did itsomething mustve provoked me, but I just wanted to take another look, to be absolutely sure that monster was dead.But dyou know something?While I was standing there, staring at that prone body, one of her damn legs started twitching...Jesus!It frightened the hell out of me!And just to prove I hadnt imagined it, it did it again!However those limbs worked, they apparently hadnt entirely shut down.It gave me the creeps, like they had a life of their own, and I took out my laser and zapped her body a couple more times.Clancy!Lena called impatiently, obviously wondering what the hell I was doing, and I turned and shuffled after her, having to steady myself for a moment on the doorframe, a sharp pain shooting down my leg.Dr.Simon led us to an elevator that took us down to the basement and what turned out to be the executive transport area.There were a couple of Specials there, but Gigi took them by surprise before they could even draw their weapons.Just in that moment it went through my head how easy it all was again: shooting peopletaking livesand that I still regarded it as wrong.Theres a side door, the doc told us, pointing to the far corner.Really?I said, my attention distracted by his limo parked nearby.Nono!he started, already guessing what I was thinking.Not my car!Sorry, Doc, I cant walk that far, I told him, directing him toward the limo with my laser, guessing it would need his voice activation to unlock.No matter how battered my body felt, how painful some of its moves, I had no choice but to drive.The only other driver was the doc and we werent likely to trust him.Lena sat next to me, ready to help if needed, while Gigi sat in the back, obviously taking a certain amount of pleasure in keeping her laser trained on Doc Simon in case he had another rush of blood and tried to stop us.What the hell had happened back there?I just didnt know.Had Gigi been working for Nora Jagger all along, setting us up with those messages she left?It even went through my head that it was her to blame for Infinity rolling over the church, and that maybe shed been responsible for what happened with Ray.Then again, she did try to warn usand for sure, she couldnt have been any more discouraging about our attempts at getting into Infinity.Maybe her loyalties had been split, and seeing Nora Jagger hit Lena, then on the point of killing me, had finally decided her?Or perhaps itd always been about assassinating that woman and this was just the culmination of her plan?She did say she was a double agent.I didnt know, and right at that moment, I didnt care.The main thing was she came good in the end.Id ask her sometime, when the time was rightthat was, if we ever got out of Infinity.I didnt know what I expected to see when the garage doors slid open, but as we paused at the top of the ramp what we got was mayhem and madness.Jimmy mustve really messed with the growlers programming cuz those things were everywhere, attacking anyone they saw, running in packs from one place to another the moment they registered any kinda movement.From where we were it looked like most of the Specials had taken refuge in the main buildingwaiting for someone to rectify the malfunction, I guessed.But over by the main gate there were people trapped in the office and a real battle was going on.I could see Specials firing out the windows, trying to destroy the growlers, but though they were getting hit over and over, not many were being put out of action.Damaged growlers had started sharing their parts with each other, rebuilding, and even as we watched, three legged ones were getting going again, picking themselves up and resuming their siege of the office.I looked up to the roof, expecting to see the Dragonflies, figuring they were the only thing that might contain growlers, but it looked like thered been some kind of accidentone was actually hanging precariously over the edge, and it was stopping all the others taking off.Specials on the ground floor of the main building were leaning out of windows, firing at growlers, then dodging back inside when they got too near.In a way it was the defining moment of the whole conflict: all those growlers massing outside, making a hell of a noise, snarling and snapping, unable to get in, while those in the building were unable to neutralize them.It was a stalemateor it sure looked like itbut one of the growlers had other ideas.It was almost like hed reasoned it out: suddenly he ran full pelt at a window, smashing his way through and bounding in amongst the people inside, creating chaos, dragging screaming Infinity staff to the floor.And the moment that growler succeeded, others did the same.I guess there was some kind of organic programming going on, where they learned from each other, cuz within seconds growler after growler was running at the windows and smashing their way in.Oh my God!Lena moaned, her voice jarring me into action.I turned in the direction of the gates, steering mainly with one hand, moving as silently and sedately as I could, hoping the growlers wouldnt notice us, but we hadnt gone more than twenty or thirty yards before there was a thud at the back and I knew we were under attack.I pulled up the exterior cameras to see a pack of half a dozen or more growlers around us.Several of them were repeatedly running headlong at the vehicle, head butting it, trying to smash their way in, while others were sinking their jaws into whatever they could, chomping down with those razor sharp rows of teeth, trying to rip bits off.I thanked God that limo was reinforced, bullet  and laser proofed, but the truth was, in places it was already starting to look like they were getting the better of it.One of them got a hold of the fender, crunched it in its huge jaws and ripped off a whole section of bodywork.My limo!Dr.Simon wailed.You gotta damn sight more to worry about than that, I told him as I swerved around a growler, the pain in my shoulder causing me to cry out.Clancy?Lena started.Its okay, I told her, though the truth was, I was feeling just that bit faint.There was this awful scratching, scraping noise and I looked out to see several of the growlers had got their jaws firmly into the bodywork, their legs locked, and with sparks flying from their metallic feet, were doing their best to drag us to a halt.I had to jam my foot down just to maintain our speed, the pain in my leg lancing down to my toes, seemingly impaling me to the floor.I glanced across at Lena, checking she was holding up okay, her face like day old ashes, and in that precise moment there was an explosion in my ear, and a growler came through my side window.I hit the brakes, screeching to a halt with the damn thing actually wriggling away in my lap, its eyes flashing, those huge jaws snapping at everythingJesus, I thought that glass was supposed to be unbreakable!Somehow I managed to reach through the pain barrier to grab its head with my damaged arm and, hugging it to my laser, shot it at point blank rangeit was taking a risk in such a confined space, but I had no other choice.The growler went all limp and powered down, in an instant nothing more than a pile of junk on top of me Clancy!You okay?Lena asked.I picked up the growler, its weight almost too much for me, and with Lena supporting one of its front legs, just for a moment I scrutinized its face only inches from mine.Jeez, that was a killing machine if Id ever seen one; those teeth could bite your head off.For sure I never wanted to be that close to one again.I was just about to throw it out of the window, to get it as far away from us I could, when suddenly it powered up again: the eyes lit up, the jaws snapped open and it let out a heart stopping growl right into my face.I dont know how I dodged it, but somehow I did, lurching to one side just as those massive jaws snapped shut, taking a huge chunk out of my seat.Around me everyone was screaming.It was bedlam.I dodged this way and that, doing my best to avoid that damn things teeth, its feet scrambling at my lap as it tried to get some kind of purchase.It bit into my parka and ripped it right off me, and somehow, in that moment of confusion, I managed to clamp my good arm around its jaws.The only trouble was, it was so damn strong its mouth kept opening an inch or two, with me straining to snap it shut again.I knew I couldnt keep it up for long: I wouldve had problems with that thing normally, but the shape I was in, I could feel my grip starting to weaken.ClancyClancy!Lena shouted, and I glanced her way to see she had her laser pointed at the growler but couldnt get in a shot cuz I was so entangled with it.I just about had the strength left to repel it one last time, and maybe, if she could knock it out for a few seconds, get it outta the limo.Do it!I cried, shoving it as far away from me as I could, hard up against the dash.I dont knowmaybe Specials were issued with different types of weapons or something, cuz I didnt have to worry about throwing it out.Lena blew its head straight off and out the window.Or maybe its just she was a better shot than me.Either way, she made a real mess of it and I gratefully heaved what was left out and drove on.This time I got up a little speedthe last thing we needed was another of those things coming through the window.God knows how fast they could run cuz they responded immediately, staying with us all the way, hell bent on wrenching that limo apart.One of them managed to scramble up on the trunk and I could see it standing there, on the point of puncturing the back window.I slammed my foot to the floor, hurtling toward the gate as fast as I could, knowing Id have to smash my way through, then, at the last moment, I swerved violently, flicking the tail around, dislodging the growlers, sending them rolling over and over and smashing up against the office wall.Special delivery, I muttered, and glancing in the rearview mirror saw wed only just made it through, that iron barriers were sliding outta the ground and stingers erecting their teeth across the entrance.Jimmy, Delilah, Gordie and Hanna were hiding on the other side of the road.I pulled over, shouting for them to get in even before Id stopped, not knowing how long those emergency barriers and the general confusion would delay any pursuit.There was a lot of noisy jubilation as we sped away, most of it centered around seeing Lena again, a little at the fact that we had a limo, though Delilah was surprised to see its owner with us.You still alive?she asked the doc, knowing immediately who he was.Just, he complained, like hed been the victim of a poorly organized adventure vacation.Wouldnt be if I had my way.Dr.Simon went quiet at that, shrinking into the corner, appreciating how great the enmity was toward him and probably starting to wonder what his fate was gonna be.I decided to put him out of his misery.We didnt have any reason to keep him any longer, so a little further down the street I pulled over.What about my limo?he protested.Do you know how much this cost?I know how much it could cost you now, I warned him.He sighed, realizing it was hopeless, and waited for me to unlock the doors, but Jimmy wasnt happy.You just gonna let him go?he asked.Back to his luxury lifestyle?What else?I asked.He turned to Delilah like they had something planned.You got it?Yep, Lile replied, reaching into her pocket and pulling out the hunting knife.Do it, the little guy told her.I wondered what on earth they had in mind, and Dr.Simon began scrambling at the locked door, pleading with them not to hurt him.What the hell you doing?I asked as Delilah moved toward him, but she ignored me, leaning forwardI thought, about to cut his facebut she just nicked his ear and gave it a squeeze.Got it?Jimmy asked.Yep, Delilah replied proudly.You can go now, Jimmy told the doc.But While you still can...I unlocked the doors and he got out, scampering off like a frightened rabbit.What was that all about?Lena asked as I pulled away.We removed his implant, Jimmy told her.I erased all his records earlier.Dr.Evan Simon is now officially a nonperson, just like us.Hell be walking the streets and living outta trash cans until it gets sorted.I have to admit I couldnt help but snigger at the thought of the doc rummaging through garbage in all his fraying finery.And was it you who messed with the growlers?I asked.Those Infinity people aint so smart, he said.I also set up a real cool collision with Dragonflies.Damn near got us killed, I complained.Hanna and Gordie moved forward, peering over the back of my seat.So what happened?she asked.I told them the whole story: right from when Id regained consciousness in the hospital wing til the moment wed crashed out through the main gates.Jimmy was as fascinated by Nora Jagger as horrified; kept saying again and again how much he wished he couldve seen those limbs, maybe even analyzed how they worked.The only thing I didnt mentionand nor did Lenawas Gigis possible collusion with Infinity.Ever since wed thrown Dr.Simon outta the limo and shed had no duty to perform shed gone noticeably quiet, I guess wondering when it was gonna come out.But like I said, now wasnt the timeand who knew when it would be?I drove on, no longer feeling faint, relief making my various aches and pains dull into something almost bearable.We were passing through the city center, negotiating the usual scenes of fire and smoke, running gangs, looting and fighting.Thank God, Delilah said.What?Jimmy asked.Were finally getting outta this place.Jimmy turned to look out of the window and almost immediately gave this sharp intake of breath.Stop!What?I asked.Stop, Big Guy!Here!Here!I screeched to a halt and he opened his door.Ill be five minutes.Jimmy?But it was too late; he was already pegging it across the street, heading up this narrow alleywayonly then did it occur to me that we were on familiar territory.Oh no!I groaned.Whats the matter?Lena asked.Its the place he went gaming, I told her, and the kids immediately started to snigger.What?Delilah croaked.You go and haul his ass outta there!I was so surprised hed do such a thing with Infinity probably already combing the City for us...I dont believe him sometimes, I growled, I really dont.Its his last chance!Gordie explained from the back seat.For what?To play!Hes going out in the country...and hes old.Oh, thank you, Delilah commented sarcastically.We went on like that for some minutes: Delilah and me annoyed, Lena keeping out of it, the kids sticking up for Jimmy so that, by the time wed stopped, his five minutes was more or less up and we just waited in scornful silence, keeping an eye out for any sign of Specials, until finally Jimmy came pegging back across the street, a huge smile on his face.Look how happy he is, Hanna cooed.The little guy squeezed in, chortling to himself.So cool!So cool!he kept repeating, but Delilah was having none of it.What the hell were you doing?Oh...You know, he teased, knowing all too well we didnt.Jimmy!Putting the record straight!he told her.What dya mean?We cant go without saying something, Lile.He had that look about himI knew it so damn wellbut I never said anything, just accelerated away.Wed find out soon enough.In fact, it was only a matter of minutes: we were driving through a busy area, mostly intact and functioning, with not that many fires and plenty of shops and screens, when suddenly all the screens went blank and a familiar face appeared.Oh my God!Delilah croaked.Youd be amazed how much power you can get from linking a lot of computers together, even in a video arcade, Jimmy said, that smug smile now threatening to crack his face in two.I pulled over for a few moments, sliding down everyones window so we could all catch what was being said.He really let them have it: spilling the beans, the can, and everything else too, revealing exactly what Infinity had been up to: how theyd lied about the satellites, that they hadnt been a force for good at all but had been slowly poisoning everyone.How theyd lied about him, that the price on his head had just been an attempt to shut him up.And hed left it on a loop, so that as we drove on and people were gathering around other screens, it kept playing over and over.Cant they shut you down?Gigi asked.Not really.Ive set it up from alternating sourcesits bouncing around all over the place.Maybe if they shut off the powerI dont think theyd risk it though.Not tonight.In a way, I guess that was it: the sweetest of cherries on the most delicious of cakes.The final evidence that wed done it: wed freed Lena and come out best against Infinity.Everyone started congratulating Jimmy, giving him the praise he unquestionably deserved, but really, I think we were all congratulating each other, getting back some of that joy wed experienced when we were floating across from the Island.Finally we were gonna gorge ourselves on the freedom wed all got so excited about.Not only were we leaving that hell hole of a city, but who knew, with a bit of luck, Jimmy mightve started some kind of revolution.Not to mention that wed slain the monster that was Nora Jagger.No wonder Delilah started singing, no wonder we all joined in, even Gordie, though he used a funny voice now and then, just to show he wasnt being serious.Hanna exchanged smiles with him, Gigi looked that bit put out and I wondered if maybe we had a winner at last.For sure it looked like it.And suddenly I let out a long loud yell, frightening the hell out of everyone and giving myself something of a jolt in the shoulder.Clancy!Delilah protested.What the hell was that?That was the sound of me appreciating the moment, I told her, reminding her of the conversation wed had in the churchyard, cuz I swear to God, at this moment, I got everything I could ever possibly wish for.And I was right.I did have everything: the woman I loved more than life itself was back at my side, our baby inside her and the three of us were escaping to freedom and a better lifenot to mention our dearest friends with us.Yeah, okay, if I was really honest about it, I wouldve liked Arturo to be there, too, but I guess you need a little sadness to understand the true nature of joy.It was as close to perfection as anyone had a right to be, and how often do any of us get to say that?And for how long?I drove slowly on, soon beginning the climb up into the hills.The smoke was nowhere near as thick as when wed tried to leave before, and even with my broken window it was being pretty efficiently handled by the limos air conditioning, so that, apart from visibility issues, we were barely aware of it.I have no idea why it suddenly occurred to meonly that it did.I was going over whatd happened, the way you do after a little excitementthe things that couldve gone wrong, the things that thankfully went rightand having this slight pang of guilt about the people Id killed, the number of Specials lives Id ended.I even started to count them, til finally I decided that wasnt such a good idea and gave up.At least Id only stunned those guys in the hospital...And then, slowly, oh so slowly, it began to creep up over me, to get into my head, to burrow down into my mind.Oh nodont tell me...I couldnt have!I never said anything, just fumbled my laser outta my pocket, keeping it down in the gap between my seat and the door, pressing the status button and taking a quick look.Aw, shit!Shit!How could I have been so stupid?Thats why Lenas laser blew that growlers head off while mine only stopped it for a few seconds.Jeez, how could I have been so damned forgetful?I never changed the setting after I zapped those guys in the hospital!I hadnt killed anyone that night, just stunned them...and oh Jesus...oh God...Gigi used my laser on Nora Jagger!The same one I shot her with again as we left...She aint dead!Oh no!I moaned, so desperately trying to keep silent it came out as a kind of tortured whisper.Whats the matter?Lena asked.I shook my head.Nothing.Just cant believe were actually going free.Delilah gave a cheer from the back, the kids joined in, but Lena looked at me a little quizzically.Finally, I added, as if to reassure her, but I could see she still wasnt entirely convinced.When we got to the top of the hills, we found a lookout point and stopped, everyone tumbling out of the limo, anxious to say goodbye to the City.Even in the dark, you could see how much less smoke there was, and fewer fires.We could only spot a couple of really big ones, and the others looked to be dwindling, on their way to dying, all that concrete and construction material impregnated with rogue rocket fuel finally degrading to nothing.Lena came up behind me, carefully putting her arm around my waist, anxious not to cause me any pain.You okay?she asked.Fine.Youve gone a little quiet.Too much excitement for an old guy, I told her.She smiled, though I still wasnt sure she was convinced.Im so happy, Clancy, she told me, maybe thinking I needed a little reassurance.Me, too, I said, just about managing a quick squeeze.Id already decided I wasnt gonna let it upset me, nor anyone else, come to that.I mean, maybe I was wrongmaybe there was another explanation?In any case, sometimes when people get stunned they end up having a heart attack and dying anyway.As far as I was concerned, Nora Jagger was dead, and that was an end to itwhere we were going, it wasnt gonna affect us one way or the other.You sure youre okay?Lena asked.You took a bit of a beating.Nah, I replied, male pride winning out over the simmering fire that was my pain.I was more worried about you and the baby.How hard she threw you up against that wall.We kissed and I had my first go at gently stroking her stomach.Lena laughed for maybe the first time since I found her in that hospital bed, and I fell in love with her all over again.And again.Was she really the only woman in the City capable of producing a baby?Surely not; there had to be otherscuz if there werent, they were gonna come after her for sure, and wed never be safe, no matter where we went.Thing is, I didnt want any of this, and nor, I was sure, did she.We just wanted normality, to find somewhere nice to raise a family and have a full and happy life.What else would you expect from a simple old big guy?What could possibly bring him greater pleasure?Nothing I know.Wed better go, I said, not wanting to chance staying any longer.Take a last look, Delilah called over, and we all paused for a moment and did exactly as she suggested, gazing down at the smoky, smoldering carpet of a city, wishing that hell hole the meanest of farewells.Think I can see the Square, Delilah said.Over there.I nodded, though actually the direction she was pointing seemed all wrong to me.The kids turned back toward the limo, Jimmy and Delilah tagging on behind, but when I went to follow, Lena suddenly stopped, gripping my hand so tightly her nails were digging into my flesh.Whats the matter?I asked, but she never replied, just remained perfectly still.Lena?I cant see anything.Yeah, well, I think thats Delilahs fanciful imagination, I told her.The Squares over there.No, Clancy!When I got thrown...Ive gone blind again.
